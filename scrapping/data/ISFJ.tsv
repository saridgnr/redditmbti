125	ISFJ Handling Care and Manual	This manual is part of a series of guides originated by [**@intpboard**](https://tmblr.co/mTyOnXogUfFjTIpM_yekL2A)**!**  \n\n**Congratulations!** You have come under the care of your very own ISFJ unit, probably because you needed help with a task and they needed an excuse to procrastinate.  They have offered you this manual in a simple attempt to assist you.  You should be pleased that they have chosen you to benefit from their helpful nature!\n\n**Your ISFJ unit will come equipped with the following accessories:**\n\nOne (1) large cup of coffee (refillable)\n\nFour (4) extra jackets to give you if you are cold\n\nTwo (2) semi-fancy outfits\n\nThree (3) casual outfits, one of which they strongly prefer\n\nOne (1) calendar to keep track of important dates\n\nOne (1) coffeepot, for refilling coffee cup\n\nThree (3) grandiose, altruistic life paths\n\nOne (1) large dog\n\nInfinite (∞) support, patience, work ethic, and enthusiasm\n\n**Software:**\n\nYour ISFJ will come preprogrammed with the following traits:\n\n**Si:** Your ISFJ will often be preoccupied with thoughts about the world and people around them, and may zone out during these times.  Don’t be alarmed – this is normal.  They are just gathering information about their surroundings, processing their impressions, and filing everything away in our vast internal filing cabinet. Disturbing them during this process will often result in blank stares and confusion.\n\n**Fe:** This trait is activated only when necessary, following the processing phase. After your ISFJ has updated the filing cabinet with the gathered information, you will find them very interactive, friendly, and helpful! They contain a special chip which makes them particularly intuitive and responsive to all your feelings and needs, as well as overly willing to assist you in anything you may need. When making decisions, will first consider the needs of other people and the impact of the decision on them and others. \n\n**Ti:** Occasionally, instead of Fe following the processing phase, your ISFJ will need to withdraw and spend time deeply analyzing the information gained.  This trait allows them to balance their people pleasing side with their analytical side. Occassionally enjoys puzzle games or analyzing the information we have learned through Si. Form an inner logical framework of how the world works. \n\n**Ne:** The weakest trait of the ISFJ, Ne works with Fe to prod the ISFJ into trying new things.  It is also responsible for their occasional bursts of creative ideas and plans! However, it is only able to activated for fleeting periods of time; pushing an ISFJ too far out of their comfort zone for too long will cause them to revert to the withdrawn, silent behavior that characterizes their original information-gathering mode.\n\n**Getting Started:**  \n\n\nWhen you first start up your ISFJ, do not be alarmed by their silence! The first stage of ISFJ programming requires distant observation, which allows them to gather information about their surroundings!\n\n1. Place included cup of coffee in your ISFJ’s hand.\n\n2. Set them on a bench in a busy location.\n\n3. Allow your ISFJ to charge by observing details about the situation.\n\n4. If step 3 does not work, place included dog on leash and hand leash to ISFJ; Fe mode should trigger when ISFJ is approached about dog.\n\n5. If your ISFJ still doesn’t start, announce a task with which you need assistance.\n\n**Modes:**\n\n*Selfless Giver (default)* – In this mode, ISFJs will jump at any opportunity to help others, regardless of their own schedule or plans.  They will never complain about this type of service.  Even if they do not want to help you, they will – regardless of any inconvenience it may cause them.  Taking advantage of this mode too often will result in an unhealthy ISFJ that will shut down in response to future requests.\n\n*Nature Lover* \- Activated when outside in nature settings.  ISFJs love nature, particularly the solitude and silence they can find there.  This allows them to process information without the interference of additional information.  They are likely to bring you outside with them, in an effort to help you silence your mind as well – even if this is not your idea of fun, please be patient. They are just trying to help you.\n\n*Humble* \- Activated in response to any type of praise.  ISFJs prefer to downplay their own accomplishments, as they are uncomfortable with overwhelming praise.  This often results in their successes being claimed by others, which upsets the balance of the ISFJ and often triggers Clowning mode to hide anger and disappointment.\n\n*Observer* \- Activated in busy situations/places. Your ISFJ will be content to sit back and watch the action around them.  Although they will be lightly conversational, attempting to engage them more deeply will not be successful – they are too busy processing their surroundings.\n\n*Clowning* \- ISFJs are prone to self-deprecating jokes. They use this as a defense mechanism to hide their emotions. A shield of laughter is the best defense of all! To this end, they also find joy in puns, wordplay, and any unique jokes. Their sense of humor never ceases to surprise, so try not to be taken aback!  Activated most often around NF units.\n\n**Relationships with other units:**\n\n**NFs**: ISFJs have very close relationships with NFs, because they are both concerned with the care and well-being of the other.  The ISFJ also often balances the NF, who prefers an “outside the box” way of thinking to the more traditional views of the ISFJ.  NFs can also be too demanding of the ISFJ – they need to know when to let up or they will burnout their ISFJ unit.\n\n**NTs**: NTs have a very strong drive and work ethic that the ISFJ greatly admires; in return, the NT admires the way ISFJs care so deeply for others.  This is a relationship that can produce a lot of mutual respect.  However, NTs are far more logical than ISFJs, who are more focused on emotions, and this can cause friction.\n\n**SJs**: ISFJs get along very well with other SJs.  They are both responsible and trustworthy, as well as equally willing to take care of one another.  This creates a nurturing environment for the ISFJ that is very important for their health and security.\n\n**SPs**: SPs are fun loving and carefree, capable of assisting an ISFJ with big plans, ideas, or experiences triggered by the Fe trait. However, the SP must recognize that the ISFJ has a limit and be respectful of that – if not, their wild, impetuous nature can quickly wear down an ISFJ.\n\n**Feeding:**\n\nWhen busy, an ISFJ will often forget that food is necessary. This is especially true when engrossed in a project that will help others or while bringing one of their ideas/adventures to life.  To properly care for an ISFJ, you must feed them at least once a day.  If they are resistant to stopping long enough to eat, tell them you are feeling hungry and allow them the option of preparing (or paying for) the meal – their overly kind nature will override their natural enthusiasm for work and in making sure you are fed, they will feed themselves as well.\n\n**Grooming:**\n\nYour ISFJ will groom on a regular basis, as it never knows when it will be called away to help someone else.  They will always keep themselves clean and their appearance tidy – they never want to call too much attention to themselves, so they groom and dress in a way that allows them to blend in.  You will not need to monitor this function for your unit, and you should leave it to the ISFJ to take care of at all times; insinuating that your ISFJ is untidy in any way will cause them to feel offended and could result in total shut down until you apologize.\n\n**Sleeping:**\n\nYour ISFJ unit will sleep regularly, as being well rested is necessary to support the enthusiasm with which they approach their day (whether their day is at school, at work, or being with others).  Despite this, they often need naps or a large amount of caffeine to keep running in Selfless Giver mode – this mode drains their energy very quickly.\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions:**\n\n*How do I get my ISFJ to relax and take a break?*\n\nYou don’t!  ISFJ’s are not capable of “relaxing” in the traditional sense.  During their dormant periods, their brains are still rapidly processing and filing information.  The word “relax” is foreign to them and will confuse them if mentioned too often.\n\n*Help! I lost my ISFJ!*\n\nDon’t worry!  ISFJs often need a break to recharge by going into one of the aforementioned dormant periods. They will reappear shortly!  If it has been more than six hours, brew a pot of coffee and wait.  The smell of coffee should bring your ISFJ out of dormancy.\n\n*My ISFJ does not like to try new things?  What do I do?*\n\nISFJ units come with a preinstalled love of habit and familiarity. Attempting to change too much at once can lead to a complete crash if you are not careful!  To deal with this, introduce your ISFJ to new situations, places, and people very gently.  Be patient and they will adjust in time.  Their Fe and Ne traits will also occasionally activate and push them into trying something new – make sure you take their lead and do not over stimulate them. This will cause them to withdraw into dormancy and will require additional coffee to fix.\n\n**Again, congratulations on your newly acquired ISFJ helper unit!**\n\n(Thank you to [@effervescience](https://tmblr.co/mulTdDRdyBpmpzy0ALBX1BA) for all of her help in researching and writing this guide!

5	Awesome, thanks for sharing
5	Thanks for sharing 
3	I love this omg! It's so cute, haha.
3	Love it! Would you do a ISFP one bychance OP?
3	Mine doesn't go outside, but also I live in a cold country. Is she broken? 
3	I've never seen a topic like this but it's quite fun and interesting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeel free to unpin my other topic so you can keep this pinned since this is essentially a more creative version of it and we only have 2 topics that can be pinned at a time.
2	very accurate, and I really find this guide cute and interesting !! 
2	Whoa... Did you write my personality coding??? O.o\n\nReally good write up! :)
2	Oh my god this is literally my little sister, she's such an ISFJ! 😂 I'm going to show this to her, she'll appreciate it! 
2	As an ISFJ... Maybe i should try coffee. The NT and NF reactions are incredibly valid. I've read the other versions of this and think they're all great. 
2	"If it has been more than six hours, brew a pot of coffee and wait.  The smell of coffee should bring your ISFJ out of dormancy." \n\nreally hit the nail on the head with this one.
2	OMG, this is so cute and accurate 😍😆. Thank you for programming me 😂😂
4	‘Selfless Giver’ too true, thank you ISFJs, it’s much appreciated :)
1	Love this. Great job. :) 
1	Dogs and coffee and nature ✅
1	This is so cute and informative! It makes me feel like I'm cute 😜
1	This is the cutest. Love so much ❤️❤️
1	I love this! I hope I find someone who would want to read this Manual about taking care of me. 😆
11	Do we want structured, scheduled posts ie weekly/daily/weekend threads?	So u/kjeezy0127 and I have done some themed threads, and I did a few weekend threads but forgot to keep up with them. But if there's interest from the community, I'll set reminders in my phone so that I remember to post things.\n\nA few questions:\n\n1. What would you like to see? Daily/weekly/weekend/a combination?\n\n2. What would you like them to be about? Generic topics/specific topics/current events?\n\n3. Any other feedback?\n\nThanks guys, just trying to get a feel for the community! Oh and I didn't talk to u/kjeezy0127 before posting this so feel free to weigh in, dude. xD
12	I'm not an ISFJ (narrowly) but am dating an ISFJ.  It'd be neat to see topics that help me understand some of the tendencies and preferences that may come with your type!  That might also draw other types into this sub who are interested in learning.\n\nOne thing that could be fun is a weekly/monthly ISFJ appreciation thread where us non-ISFJs praise the ISFJs in our life so you can all see that your actions are appreciated.  You'd probably have to build up a decent non-ISFJ subscriber base first, though.
6	I think something that could be cool is doing an ISFJ AMA here and advertise it on /r/mbti .\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere people from that sub (non-ISFJs) can ask ISFJ questions on a sticky topic and maybe leave that open for a weekend or something.
4	Please do! I really like the weekly threads. Discussion threads where we can just talk about something or express our mood on overall the week would be wonderful. 
3	I’d appreciate anecdotes of how you ISFJ’s have taken advantage of your shadow functions. Stories are great. Really any kind of “aha” moments, esp your demon/trickster functions (my bf is an ISFJ, I’m INTP). \n\nAlso ways you have overridden Si-Ti loop either intentionally or accidentally. 
3	yes!
2	Yes I think weekend threads are good
1	What are immature ISFJs like?	Hey guys, I’m just wondering what immature ISFJs are like. I’m 17 yrs old and would like to become more self aware and possibly avoid some pitfalls. What were you like/what immature ISFJ traits do you know of?
9	Passive aggression is one of the traits of an immature ISFJs.
2	Try to become comfortable with verbalizing what you are feeling.
15	Weekend Discussion Thread: Fuck, Marry, and Kill (MBTI Types Edition)	Good late evening. So me and the co-mod thought it'd be fun to switch up the weekend thread this week with a game. We decided to do the fuck, marry, and kill game lmao. \n\nI'll start this game. \n\nFuck: ESTP. I tend to be naturally drawn to these types though I've only meant guy ESTPs. It would be interesting to meet a girl ESTP and see if we hit it off. Overall, I feel like they would be good one night stand \n\nKill: ESTJ Sorry I'm just not very drawn to the super high Te.\n\nMarry: INFJ. I only know one INFJ in real life and she's great to talk to and get her perspective on things and problems I'm having. I also feel like these personality types are deep romantics (really all of the NF types could be). I also like how their quality of being reserved but empathetic (sometimes extroverts can be overwhelming). Overall, they seem like a soulmate type. 
4	Fuck: ENxP\n\nMarry: INTP\n\nKill: ESFJ\n\n
6	Fuck: INFJ: we get on like a house on fire, they flatter me and make me feel fuzzy. We part ways before they interpret me raising a tiny issue as a warrant for full-blown attack where no holds are barred and I'm to blame for everything ever (I'm sure there's more stable and wonderful INFJs; I've just encountered some very unhealthy ones who have said horrible things to me)\n\nMarry: ENFP: so nice; draws me out, won't hurt me\n\nKill: ESTJ: same reasons as OP
3	fuck; ISTP\n\n\nmarry; ESFP\n\n\nkill; ISTJ 
3	Fuck: estp\n\nMarry: isfj\n\nKill: estj
2	Fuck: ESTP (probably couldnt deal with their ego-centric nature long term)\n\nMarry: ISTP (sexy fuckers and have a deep intensity)\n\nKill: I can’t stand the thought of killing any type....but some of my least favorites are, ESFJ, ESTJ, and ENFP 
1	Fuck: ESFP\n\nMarry: ENFP\n\nKill: INTJ\n\nSide note: I dated an ESTJ and he wasn’t so bad at all. Just very busy and focused on working 24/7. 
1	Fuck: ESFP (idk guess I like the craziness and niceness lmao)\n\nKill: ESFJ (too much Fe, stop caring about me so much!)\n\nMarry: INFJ (best friend is INFJ and we dead ass can talk about almost anything for hours)\n\n&#x200B;
5	I am INTP hubby(33 yo) wife(27 yo)is ISFJ. Please advise me how to keep my wife happy and also somehow make her acompany me in unconventional routines/activities. Help needed	\n
15	Don’t “make” her do it. She will be much more inclined to do something you want to do if you gently bring it up and let her know that it’s important to you and you would love for her to share it with you, even if only once.\n\nAlso, emphasize how much it’s *not* that you’re unhappy or dissatisfied with her as a person - you just want to do these activities that you enjoy *with* her.\n\nI assume you probably already do things that she wants to do. Try not to make her feel guilty by saying that you always join her in things she wants to do. It’s understandable, but not always helpful. \n\nOn the other hand, if you don’t join her in the things she likes to do, maybe try some out. She will probably want to reciprocate.
4	The first part, how to make her happy, might depend more on her love language than on her mbti type. Try reading into that.\n\nAs for the second part, how to convince her to do stuff together, I have no idea. I would like to know that too.\n\nI think ISFJs are very prone to depression, fear disorders and related issues, which may increase the difficulty of answering your questions.\n\nI'm an INTP (30m) with an ISFJ (24) wife btw. 
3	Make sure she knows she matters, is loved and appreciated. We love to hear that we are loved. \n\nWe also love to make those around us happy, so if you are able to express how happy it would make you if she participated in these activities with you, she will be more receptive. I dated an ENTP who was super into the card game magic the gathering (lol) and he wanted me to play with him so bad. While I thought it was so dumb, I did really try to get into it bc it made him happy. Ultimately I was like, nah this isn’t for me, but I really tried. 
1	Was there text associated with the title? Female 25 y/o Isfj here with an intp bf if you want to ask me for any more advice? 
8	ISFJ 9 chicks	What is your dating history? I'm interested in what (mbti) types of people you've been close to. How it went but also why you were attracted to them in the first place. \n\n&#x200B;
14	I’ve dated many types....here’s a quick summary:\n\nISTJ—boring. Way too similar to myself and didn’t challenge me in any ways or bring new insight into my life. Too uptight, not fun. \n\nISTP—greatest love of my life. Loved how deep, technical, introspective and good with his hands he was. Also kinda liked his aloofness. Super funny and chill. Struggled to express emotions at first, but once we got over that it was wonderful. \n\nINTJ—was really drawn to him...something about INTJs intelligence is sexy as fuck to me. Ultimately it didn’t last long. Don’t think he appreciated my conventional nature. However I’m still really drawn to them and love to listen to what they have to say.\n\nENTP—very interesting. Not sustainable but I did learn a lot from the relationship. We just were on different wavelengths most of the time and pushed each other’s buttons. \n\nISFP—wonderful, almost as wonderful as my relationship with the ISTP. He is warm, affectionate, full of wonder, peaceful, calm. He makes me relax so much and not worry. Super sensual, but also introverted and does have giant displays of love. Beautiful mind. \n\nThat’s my thoughts so far! However, I hate to define each type based on the one particular person I dated. I wish I could know many people of each type and have a better sense of healthy and unhealthy versions of each...
8	I haven't dated anyone yet!
4	Currently in a long term relationship with an ENTJ. Totally love our differences. We’ve helped each other grow a lot and keep each other grounded and real. I value honesty highly and I think that’s what attracted me to him most of all, that and his charisma. I always know where I stand and I can trust his judgement completely.  \nBefore him, I was with an INTJ. I’ve clearly got a thing for XNTJ’s! He was also really charismatic and I enjoyed his intellect a lot.
3	My husband is ESFJ. So we're pretty similar, except for his extroverted-ness. We have a lot of the same values as far as relationships and family go, so it was easy there. Our biggest problem is how introverted I am, and how extroverted he is. He's not an extreme extrovert by any means, but it has taken a lot of talks/discussion to find some common ground with how much time we spend with eachother vs with friends.
3	Took me a long time to find anyone I wanted to be in a relationship with who also wanted to be with me. 😆 I married him recently. \n\nI was attracted to his confidence and humor, I think. And also that he could deal with my anxiety LOL. I sometime resemble a 4 or 6.\n\nHe’s an INTP 5 but several years older than I, which I think contributes to his extroversion, uncharacteristic for his type. \n\nPrior to that, I had mostly been attracted to men who were uninterested in me and probably emotionally unavailable but whom I felt a desire to save. 🤷🏼‍♀️\n\nEdit: Also - goals. Values. They lined up pretty well.
2	ISFJ 9w1 :)\n\nIDK my first boyfriend's type. he seemed sensitive, has this silent strong outside, soft inside aura, had this protective, stable vibe about him. He was very practical, I think he's a thinking type for sure..\n\nSecond boyfriend was INFP (he introduced me to MBTI :p)  I loved everything about him, everything about him was attractive to me. <3 the connection I had with him was/is only something I can dream of. Yes, there were some aspects about him that used to get me worried for him, but I loved him. Sometimes, it still depresses me that I had to part with him.
5	Does my ISFJ acquaintance dislike me? (INTP)	Hi,\n\nI am currently in living arrangements with some of my acquaintances (2 couples - 4 people) and one of them is an ISFJ. We have been living together in rented accommodation for 3 years now. Me and her have always had civil relation with each other.\n\nThat gradually changed over time: due to our immense differences in tastes and interests, we started talking less to each other, and eventually it came to a situation where her behaviour towards me is the following:\n\n1. She would never initiate any conversation with me. If I say hi, she would say hi back, and that's it. She never asks about how am I doing and if I didn't initiate the conversation, we could literally go months without talking to each other.\n2. If I tried initiating - asked her about how her day was, etc. - she would give me very short responses and no 'hooks' to keep the conversation going. She wouldn't even look at me when giving these answers, and she isn't expressive whatsoever.\n3. All of the above is not the case with anyone else: if someone else asks about her day, she elaborates, uses facial expressions such as smile and actually looks towards that other person. She also follows up with a question of her own. None of that happens when she talks with me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan you, dear ISFJs, enlighten why is this the case? Is this how you behave towards a person that you dislike? Maybe she hates me? Doesn't feel comfortable around me? Is it possible that the main reason she acts towards me like this is because we are just so different? Is it possible to reverse this?\n\nFrom what I remember, I have never insulted her or acted unkindly towards her...
11	Sounds exactly like how I would behave in this situation. My main way of relating to people is through shared interests. If we don't have them, I won't want to talk to you that much because I know it's not going to go anywhere or get deep. Doesn't mean I don't like you, but it's not energy I feel like is worth expending, if that makes sense.
8	Real talk, I don't think she hates you. Y'all just have nothing in common. In my opinion ask her do you want to hang out. But in all honesty, I don't think she dislike or hate you.
5	Honestly I have acted this way with a housemate who I did not like because they weren't a nice individual in every way possible and i wanted to cut my communication short with them. But you actually seem concerned and care about why your housemate may be acting this way. You may have done something that you didn't mean to personally effect them, but you may not be aware of it. If i were you , i'd confront them in the kindest way possible by asking if you did anything wrong because you really want to get a long with her, and that you're willing to fix it if u did something wrong.
3	if she doesn't know what to say, and doesn't know how to speak with you that she actually knows makes you comfortable, then that makes her uncomfortable. this results in her not talking to you at all because .. she doesn't know what to say, and doesn't want to throw herself out of her comfort zone.
3	I'd probably find myself acting like this if I were annoyed or resentful about someone being inconsiderate towards myself or others eg being messy or not contributing well to household practically and emotionally. It'd take me a v long time to get to the point of actually showing my frustration outwardly in how I interact with them. No idea if this is the issue here, just thought I'd let you know how it is for me!
2	I kind of act like this when I don't like something about someone. It doesn't mean I dislike them as a person, I just have no interest in interacting with them.
2	Maybe with the passing of the years she just realized that you have nothing in common with her, but I feel like her behaviour is not just about not having anything in common, specially from what you said about her behaviour with your other aquaintances. Does she interact more with them than she does with you on a regular basis (I mean, spending time with them, even if nobody speaks)? Have you all known eachother for the same time?   \n\n\nAnother possibility is that you've made some comments that were unpleasant for her through all these years that were probably insignificant, but after being piled up they became a big discomfort and her way of avoiding more of those is just to cut communication with you, but hey! this is probably because she doesn't hate you at all and doesn't want to end up hating you (this is just a hypothesis of mine)  \n\n\nWhatever it is the reason for her behaviour, I believe she doesn't hate or dislike you, she's just probably trying to avoid something that makes her uncomfortable, be it the awkwardness of not having anything to talk about, comments that she may dislike that are innocent... 
1	I wouldnt blame her personality type. It seems to just be introverted behaviour to me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWomen especially tend to open up to some people more than others and introverts and other introverts can often be pretty awkward together. There are a lot of variables here so its pretty hard to pin down. How you ask a question can lead to many different answers from another person. I used to get a lot of one word answers from women when I went on dates but now with a few tweaks women seem to give me better responses. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest way to tell if she dislikes you or not is if she is quick to get away from you or distances herself from you. Just keep a watch on her body language and what she does with herself when you are around. 
1	I am INTP and my wife is ISFJ. You know what we really have to put in a lot of hardwork and tons of communication to have a good day to day life. 
1	She probably doesn't view you as more than an acquaintence. I know for me awkward small talk with acquaintences and strangers isn't something I enjoy. I will say points number 2 and 3 could be good signs that she doesn't like you. Those points honestly sound like what I would do if I hated someone or just avoid them. My advice is to just say something along the lines of " Hey I've noticed you've been act strange around me. Did I accidentally do something wrong? I really value our relationship and want you to feel like you can be honest around me and do what I can to make this right". I wish you luck. 
1	I find her behavior very rude to be honest. Especially if she behaves differently towards the others in the house. But - that is her problem and not yours (unless you know of something you might have done to hurt her feelings. But my guess is you don't know of anything..). I would keep doing what you are doing - be friendly and ask her a question or two when you do meet. But give her lots of space, since she is clearly sending out signals of wanting to be left alone. 
6	How do you relate to INTP's?	Okay, so this post is phrased strangely, but here's what I'm getting at: ISFJ's and INTP's have the same functions in a different order.  ENTP's have the same functions as us, too, but since ISFJ's and INTP's are both introverts, I'd think that most ISFJ's would feel that they have more in common with the INTP than they do with the ENTP.  As an ISFJ, I'm wondering what you've thought of some INTP's that you've met.  Do you feel that you have an "INTP side?"  I certainly feel like I have an INTP side - it's hard to explain, but even though Si and Fe are the functions that I use the most daily and value the most, my Ti and Ne always seem to be working in the background.   When I'm thinking about something, I'll sometimes almost feel like my Ti+Ne are more prominent than my Si+Fe, even though it wouldn't seem that way on the outside.  Some ISFJ's I've met think that many INTP's are socially awkward, or odd.  But others I've met have a lot in common with the typical INTP, even though you wouldn't realize it after initially meeting them.
6	INTP male here.  I've been in a committed relationship with ISFJ female for 6 years now.  \n\nOne of the main things I appreciate is authenticity.  Early on, she pretended to be into some of the things I like, which made it seem like we had a lot in common.  That was nice in the beginning, but unsustainable, and ultimately  disappointing for me because when she stopped pretending it left us in a situation where she doesn't partake in any of the activities that I initiate. I love hanging out with her, but to do so means I have to only do activities that she chooses.  \n\nWhy are you analyzing how you relate to INTPs?  If the ultimate goal is to make relate better, you might do better just focusing on being authentic, not try to tweak yourself to fit them.  I gravitate to people who are authentic and different to me way more than inauthentic and similar.
4	I have not noticed that I have a lot in common with INTPs (or ENTPs); however, for some reason the ones that have common interests as me (movies, books, business etc.) are majorly attracted to me and I can keep their attention easily. I can keep up never-ending witty banter with them and make them laugh etc but at a very surface level. I would not share my fears and insecurities and open up to them easily (or to anyone actually :P)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have no idea how or why this can be because INTPs are considered among the greatest Thinkers and I am not someone who enjoys having deep conversations about abstract subjects (although I enjoy lengthy discussions about society, business, etc.).
3	Two of my bestfriends are INTP's. I make them laugh non stop. They just think I'm silly and I really lean into it around them since they are a great audience. They both bring a thoughtful side out of me. They make me think about the world a little more critical and less emotional, but they also bring in their own "logical" emotions oit around me. 
2	i agree with you ... sometimes
2	I REALLY struggle to relate to INTPs. They always seem so far removed from emotion of any kind that it makes them seem flat and uncaring to me. 
2	Maybe you think you are doing something you’re not. Idk, I can’t say for sure, but ISFJ’s I’ve met only make me frustrated when I try to have a logical conversation that questions their beliefs. Having logical conversations that question one’s beliefs whether they’re in an INTPs head or in dialogue is kind of our thing. Maybe it’s just the ones I’ve met, but I can’t see the resemblence.
2	Two of my close friends are INTPs actually. I definitely feel like I can understand them even when they are unhealthy. I made a post a while ago about how since we have the same four functions when healthy these types can have a good connection. I will say I admire the way they can use Ti w/o effort and I enjoy analyzing things with them. However, there are many factors beyond personality type that go into friendships and relationships. It defintely helps that I have something in common with both of my INTP friends. 
11	I’m (INTP[22m]) weighing whether or not I should try to give me ex gf (ISFJ[23f]) some closure.	I broke up with my gf 2 days ago because of reasons I didn’t really understand at the time, but now know are mostly communication related. \n\nI wanted to theorize and postulate and mentally break down everything, but obviously she was content with her current knowledge base and was exhausted and stressed out by my thought process. \n\nI would try to compromise by talking about things she was interested in, hoping the conversation would be deep, but she was still content to just discuss surface level stuff.\n\nIt’s worth noting that she grew up never being encouraged to pursue and interact with the world around her. Her family was fairly materialistic and not very thought provoking. So now she is in a stage in life where she’s figuring out what she wants and likes, but hasn’t quite found them yet. \n\nI figured this would be a great journey for us to find what she likes and explore interests, but she is happy just experiencing life as it goes and not forcing herself to explore the world. \n\nThere are probably more disconnects, but I’m just trying to see if you guys would agree with what I said, and also ask if you think I should try to explain this to her, or would I just come off as a psychoanalyst being critical of her life and her family?\n\nThanks for reading.
11	It sucks that you weren’t able to connect. :( \n\nIt’s always disappointing when you think a relationship with a complementary person will enrich both your lives, and you can’t overcome the differences.\n\n>you think I should try to explain this to her, or would I just come off as a psychoanalyst being critical of her life and her family?\n\nOh god no. Don’t do it.\n\nAll my intp friends ignore me when I say to not psychoanalyze people’s weaknesses without their permission, but really- isn’t this just kicking her while she’s down? Don’t.  \n\nLet me be clearer than I like to:\n\n>	I wanted to theorize and postulate and mentally break down everything, but obviously she was content with her current knowledge base and was exhausted and stressed out by my thought process.\n\nYou already said it. She hates that kind of thing.\n\nYou can Ti this- is right now, after a break up, the optimal time for an individual’s ex to tell an individual what they think of her and her stupid family? Not if they mean anything constructive by it. But it’s definitely a good time to tell her to inflict the most pain on her, and cause the most drama. I’m definitely not saying that is what you are doing! But that’s kind of how the interpersonal cause and effect looks.\n\n\nIt really sounds like you are just asking permission to get this off your chest for your own closure, not hers. You might do it anyway, but I’m going to say that at least one person thinks it’s a terrible idea. \n\nI would wait a month at least and ask her if she wants this info from you.  \n
8	I am an INTP with two ISFJ exes and currently engaged to an ISFJ.\n\nDo not give her closure. It wont help, it will just make things worse. Leave her alone. Nothing you can possibly say will help her. I promise my dude.
7	ISFJs cannot handle criticism. Please don't criticise her.  Be sweet and take the blame. She probably could use some closure. \n\nAlso that's how S people are. They are in the here and now.  Content with now. If you want deep conversation you need to find other N friends or get a therapist to talk too. S people are more into action than deep chats about random ideas. They are living in the moment. They don't have to practice mindfulness they live it all day long.\n\nAccept her as the nice girl she is not who you wish she was. In fact maybe don't break up with her. Apologize and get back with her with a new understanding. You'll never lack for anything with an ISFJ, if they can do something for you they will. I'll take a kind person over a deep person any day. Their deep comes from the richness of their feelings not the richness of their thoughts. :D Sorry, do what you need too. I just love ISFJs so much.\n\nEdit: I should add that I'm 50 and been dating an ISFJ long distance for 2 1/2 years, and I would not trade her for anyone. She can get deep if you want to talk calculus or modular arithmetic or primitive roots as it relates to telecommunications wire bundles, which is what her masters thesis was about. She is so much smarter than I am. It's so hot and exciting. Gah\n\nAlso I didn't realize this was the ISFJ group. Sorry, I try not to butt in here with comments. Apologies.  I stand by what I said y'all are the best sort of people, and there are more of you than any other type. Yay! What could be better? Nothing.
5	Take this as a learning experience about your needs in a romantic relationship. Your ex doesn't need to know unless she specifically asks. This is about you and I hope you find a future partner that meets those needs. Good luck!
3	It sounds like she doesn't need anymore closure. You already admitted your thought process stressed her out, wanting to go any deeper will probably stress her our even worse. Leave it be. If she wants more closure she will ask you for it.
2	Here is a link to it. Test 2 gives you the instinctual variant. That's where the sx comes from.\n\nhttps://www.eclecticenergies.com/enneagram/test\n\n
2	I don't think that last post went through.\n\nhttps://www.eclecticenergies.com/enneagram/test\n\nTest 2 on that site.
2	43
2	Yeah... my gf’s mom is an ISFJ and I’ve literally never had a harder time trying to speak to someone in my life. Imo this is not the type for an INTP to mesh well with... I don’t like saying something won’t ever work bc of types, but I can’t imagine being stuck with surface level conversations for time on end. My INFJ gf and I have had a conversation going about theoretical or just random stuff since I met her 9 months ago. I as an INTP need someone to bounce my ideas off of constantly. Sometimes things just dont work bc two people aren’t meant for eachother. Maybe your ex can remain a friend in years to come.
5	My ISFJ boyfriend checked my phone and lied to me about it	I am new to this subreddit and I hope that it is okay to ask for advice. I am an INFP and concerned about my ISFJ.\n\nI (24 f) am in a serious relationship with an ISFJ (28 m) for almost two years now. We live together,  we are very happy with each other and can usually openly talk about any of our concerns. But a few days ago I noticed him (lets call him Sam) checking my phone and lying about it when I directly asked him if he did. I am not angry but I am worried why he felt the need to lie to me. I am hoping for some insight or advice from fellow ISFJs.\n\nThis is going to be a long post. But I don't know the reason for his behaviour and I don't want to skip possible important aspects.\n\nSo before this all happened I was visiting my friends and family for a few days while Sam was working. I was spending one evening with two female friends. Usually when I am with friends I don't spend much time on my phone because I rarely see them alone and want to get the most out of the time. Me not texting Sam back while being with these particular friends has been an issue before. So I tried to at least answer once every hour. Sam can be very jealous when he feels like spending time with anyone else is more important to me than he is. My girl-friends are both single and like to go out and enjoy the attention of men. But they did never push me to do anything I don't want to do nor did they ever abandon me because of a man.\n\nThere might be another incident Sam is associating with these friends. Around the time when I knew him for about two months, one of my friends was having a party. We played a drinking game and I drank way to much alcohol. I got wasted and ended up in bed with a man I didn't know before. This is absolutely no typical behaviour for me and it still freaks me out how I changed under the influence of alcohol. Me and Sam were not in a relationship back then but we where seeing each other regularly. I did not text him the whole evening,  which made him suspicious. Beeing the ISFJ he is, he kept thinking about this incident and asked me about this months later. I was honest, told him the whole story and apologized. Although we weren't in a relationship and he knows that this was unusual behaviour for me, I know that it still hurt him.\n\nIn the beginning of our relationship I was also occasionally chatting with a guy I knew from school. Nothing special, mostly just small talk and it was only important to me because he was the only male friend I had left. Sam wasn't comfortable with this. He was jealous and thought that guy was interested in more than just friendship. Because I love Sam and I don't want him to worry or feel insecure, I stopped texting and it turned out that Sam was right. He was sexually interested in me and didn't care much about our friendship, so I am not too sad about ending this relation.\n\nI guess because of what happened and the way my friends are, Sam is always worried when I spent so much time without him. Sam has also been cheated on before. This makes him extra vulnerable. I know that and I would never cheat or do anything to hurt him.\nI want to point out that on the evening last week with my friends, there was absolutely no alcohol involved and I tried to text Sam as often as possible. Me and my friends were staying at home, talking and catching up on each other's lives.\n\nWhen I returned home, everything was fine. Sam was very happy seeing me again and we enjoyed the weekend together.\n\nOn the day he was checking my phone I had a severe anxiety attack. I was crying for hours and he was comforting me the whole time. He did calm me down and we were talking about everything on my mind. I was completely honest with him and I don't think that I held anything back. I trust him and he knows that I do.\n\nLater that day I fell asleep (probably because of the excessive crying) while watching a video on my phone. I woke up when Sam was entering the room. I was still very exhausted and wanted to continue sleeping. I didn't move and pretended to still be asleep. I waited for him to either leave the room or join me and cuddle up to me. Well he didn't. He was grabbing my phone and didn't move for a while. He was standing there doing whatever he was doing while I was still pretending to sleep. After about five minutes I realized that I won't fall asleep again and felt stupid. I opened my eyes and he was still standing there looking at my phone. He pretended that he just came in and stopped the video. I know that the video wasn't playing anymore and that he had my phone for at least 5 minutes. \n\nLater that day I wanted him to tell me what was wrong. I asked him if he was sure he didn't look for anything on my phone and was just turning the video off. I asked him if something bothered him or if he was worried about me writing someone else. He then lied to me. He told me the video was still playing and I woke up right after he stopped it. He also tried to convince me that he had no reason not to trust me and that he feels too loved to ever expect I could do something behind his back. The next day everything was fine again and he seems to be happy since then.\n\nI know that there was nothing interesting on my phone and that i dont keep any secrets from him. I am not even mad that he somehow invaded my privacy. But I am really hurt and confused why he lied to me. I can't stop thinking about this. I don't know if he was concerned about me spending the time with my friends, if he was worried because of my panic attack or if he might even be self projecting. I do trust him but I know that people develop trust issues when they are the ones cheating or feeling guilty. So now I am getting paranoid and this messes me up. I don't want to accuse him of anything and I feel uncomfortable asking him about this again because he might be upset about me pretending to sleep. I would have never expected what happened. As I said we do usually talk about everything and I absolutely don't know why he lied.\n\nI have to confront him again and tell him that I know he lied. Otherwise I know that I will trust him less and that this will haunt me. I don't want this stupid incident to affect our relationship.  I get mad at myself for even thinking he might be cheating and therefore not trusting me anymore.\n\nDo you guys have some more insight or can relate to him? Did I miss something important? Or do you have advice how I can approach this without him feeling attacked or as if I betrayed him. I am thankful for any advice.
21	He was insecure and afraid. So he checked your phone. He saw nothing to worry about.\n\nThen you ask him about it. He doesn't want you to know he checked your phone because that will create conflict which he thinks he can avoid by lying. And admitting it will make him look bad and distrusting of you. He wants to be a trusting boyfriend and wants you to believe he is. But he isn't. So he lied about it. Possibly he's lying to himself in some way to justify doing that.\n\nthis needs to be confronted because secret distrust is one of those spreading cracks in the foundation of a relationship. it's gotta be dealt with to build on stronger.
5	Texting back every hour is excessive if you have been together two years and the incident you are referring to happened so long ago. It's very controlling behavior to expect that of you, especially since you were having girls time. I understand that each relationship has expectations and compromises but he needs to stop holding the behaviors of OTHER PEOPLE  against you. That is unhealthy for the relationship and himself.
4	He seems to have a very anxious attachment style. The irony is that he's afraid of you lying or betraying him but then actually becomes the one lying. Take truth as the fundament of a relationship or it's already doomed to fail. You should make this clear to him. If he follows that rule he will also lose much of his anxiety. If the anxiety doesn't get lower you could probably assume what's going on.
5	I don't feel like any of this is "typical ISFJ behavior" really.\n\n>Beeing the ISFJ he is, he kept thinking about this incident and asked me about this months later. I was honest, told him the whole story and apologized. Although we weren't in a relationship and he knows that this was unusual behaviour for me, I know that it still hurt him. \n\nI once slept with someone when I was *talking* to someone else who lived 6 hours away and wouldn't actually commit to trying a long distance relationship (his whole family is down here anyway, he comes back) and when I didn't text him that night he was really upset, he said, because I would ignore him for that. He then wanted nothing to do with me, even as a friend... it took us years to talk again. I personally, as an ISFJ, think that is ridiculous. You don't get to be mad at me for the actions I take just because I know you're *interested* in me. This guy made a move first, how is that my fault? I'm just supposed to say no to every opportunity I get for anything in case you come around? It doesn't even matter that you were intoxicated/it was out of character, etc. it's none of his business until he makes it his business by committing. \n\nHe sounds really jealous and not in a protective, loving, cute sort of way. How hard is, "you know what babe, I looked through your phone because I got nervous or paranoid but, of course, there was nothing. I'm sorry I didn't just ask you, but, if it helps, I know there doesn't need to be a next time." Even if it's a load of crap, which it shouldn't be if he didn't find anything he was uncomfortable with.\n\nAbsolutely talk to him about this, but it doesn't have to be a confrontation it can be a discussion. Especially because you really only seem upset because he lied to you not because he looked in your phone, and it's affecting *your* ability to trust *him* now and that's gonna be a little feedback loop.\n\n> I feel uncomfortable asking him about this again because he might be upset about me pretending to sleep. \n\n**Then you weren't pretending to sleep, you were trying to fall back asleep and then decided it was futile after a few minutes and you unexpectedly open your eyes to him standing on your phone.** Say you thought he walked away or at least set it down or something. If he can lie you can bend the truth to have a productive conversation, in my opinion. (I bolded that sentence because I feel like it's the most helpful point in my long as hell post).\n\nI hope you can work it out though because it really seems like you love him and I'm going to assume there's a good reason for that since all I know about him right now is the phone stuff :P \n\n&#x200B;
8	ISFJ and sales	Do you like it? Do you hate it? Both? Do you use your ISFJ functions or use your unconscious or subconscious mind to do it? ESFP side or ENTP?
10	Hate it. Period. 
4	The thought of working in sales gives me anxiety. I'd be horrible at it. 
4	Hate. I hate selling and being sold to.
4	Would depend how far on the introvert scale you are. I think I'd be good at it but I would get tired of it pretty quickly. Every time I go to buy a car I always think about being a car salesman since I tend to know more about the car than the people working there. 
3	Pretty sure we all hate it
2	Hate it. Hate working in service oriented jobs in general. 
1	I think I use my subconscious and unconscious If i'm trying to sell something or try to convince others to do something or to believe in something.
1	I have to sell warranties on computers. I t hmm ink I use my subconscious mind and the determination and caring aspect of the ISFJ personality, which is why I'm so bad I know the warrenties are crap so I don't want them to buy them. So it's hard convincing them to buy something I would never buy. But I don't hate it and I guess that's cause I like talking about computers.
11	ISFJ & ENFP romantic relationship	Hi! \n\nI'm a 17F ISFJ who has a crush on a 17M ENFP and he likes me too. I've known him for about 1 year. I feel like we're total opposites, but we share the same interests though and that's why I fell for him. Our relationship isn't quite official yet, we've just hung out at our houses watching YouTube/Netflix and discovering new music. \n\nIt's just that he's so energetic and active! He talks all the time and I try my hardest to talk back interestingly  but I just can't. I'm super scared he will think I'm a boring, private person which I'm definitely not. I have lots of stuff going on inside me and I wish I could talk about them all. I'm scared he will get bored of me because I'm not a talkative person who talks about anything I think about. I almost never start a conversation. I wish I could do it.\n\nOf course I do talk when he asks something or we find an interesting topic to discuss - sometimes I just talk and talk and talk.\n\nI become attached to people very easily and it happened with him. I think about him almost all the time and can text him about anything but it's totally different when we're face-to-face.\n\nHow to become braver and more talkative? :( I know I can't change my personality entirely but I'm afraid my personality affects in our thing in a negative way.
10	Hi! I'm an ENFP girl dating an ISFJ guy. The first few months of dating were SO hard. Conversation  definitely didn't flow super naturally. If your ENFP is anything like me, he asks a ton of questions to get to know you. The easiest way to keep a convo going is to simply ask "what about you?" after you answer one of the questions! I would let him take the lead as far as starting a conversation, but try to ask these mirroring type of questions to keep the conversations going. My ISFJ and I bonded over our sense of humor, so maybe try that? Go to a stand-up show or something together.
4	 Be yourself!! Always always always!! \nENFPs don’t need a “perfect & cool” person with the best comments and conversation topics to be comfortable and have the greatest time. \nBe yourself and say what is on your mind, imagine he is your best (all life) friend and talk to him that way. \nHe likes you the way you are, and if you are trying to hide yourself, sooner or later you will get to know each other the way you really are. There is no point in hiding it, BE YOURSELF :D I am sure he will (and has already) fall for that person.\n\n(ENTJ)\n\n
2	I am 24F ISFJ dating 32M ENFP.\n\nThey will love to see you being comfortable and talking about things that are passionate to you. You don't need to be more talkative or force yourself into doing anything you don't want to do. Just be yourself. Find something that the both of you like to do and do it wholeheartedly. You can tease him lightly. Make him laugh. Encourage him to be the best him he can be without nagging. Be cute, be patient, be you and let him be him
-1	Types for the most part dont matter in a relationship. It's about both of you being mature and honest with one another. No games. Hard work. \n\nThe types only become important when both of you can't figure out why the relationship isn't working. That's when you see two mature adults mutually splitting. 
1	Whatsapp group - MBTI & Enneagram	Hey guys, feel free to jump in! We talk anything and everything MBTI\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://chat.whatsapp.com/Ey15CEhWJag1Q1sstl8IrA](https://chat.whatsapp.com/Ey15CEhWJag1Q1sstl8IrA)

1	How's the privacy? Can the group see my phone number? 
22	Any ISFJs that feel misunderstood?	Hi, fellow isfj here.\n\nI'm wondering if it's common for isfj's to feel misunderstood. I often see things online about how intuitive types are widely misunderstood and misinterpreted, due to them being more rare, but I noticed that for a majority of my life, I too have felt that way as well. When I'm speaking or trying to explain something, sometimes the people around me think I'm reacting/feeling one way when in reality it is the opposite. I also feel as if the people I'm closest to are rather shortsighted and lack vision (and proper planning skills). As far as I can tell, no one in my closest family are xSxJ's (xSxP is very common). I noticed I tend to gravitate towards/relate to other xSxJs and xNFx's\n\nIn case it helps, I live with an INFJ (my mom, the person I'm closest to; she often knows how I'm feeling/how I think, but occasionally, there is some misunderstanding), and an ESFP (my grandmother. Very unhealthy version of type; there is often friction between us).\n\nI'm curious if any other isfj's have has experiences like this as well?
10	I think it's very human to feel misunderstood in their life,  whether it's during a period of time  or their whole life.  personally, I don't feel misunderstood. 
3	Do you feel more lonely than misunderstood maybe? I've always felt misunderstood although I have an INTJ friend who generally understands my blunt remarks to everything whereas most might feel offended while I have no idea why lol\n\nAlso may I hear your experience of living with an INFJ parent? I used to have an ISFJ girlfriend which is why I'm asking.
2	ISFJ here- proudly misunderstood by most people since 2010! Why be understood when you can be liked? \n\nIn truth, I have a few friends who do get me and I would lose my shit without them. Everyone else can get Fe-ucked (not really, but it’s often not worth trying to be understood). \n\nI have a lot of NT friends who are delightful, but I’d freak them out with all the feels stuff I’m into. 
19	I’m in love and I’m scared	I imagine this is a feeling a lot of ISFJs have....that moment when you know you are deeply in love with someone and not sure if it’s fully reciprocated but you don’t even care bc your feelings are so strong and you need to express them fully. That’s where I’m at now. \n\nIt’s such a beautiful feeling, having that much love and affection and care for someone; feels like it’s my life’s purpose. But I also hate it bc I know how hard I fall when shit goes wrong. \n\nMy current partner of about 5 months (ISFP) really struggles to concretely express affection through words. His body language would indicate to me that he feels just as strongly as I do, but also he claims he has never been in love with anyone before. \n\nI have no problem interpreting my emotions and once I understand them, I feel like I need to express them. I told him I loved him last week, to which he didn’t say much (which I expected). I’m not concerned that he didn’t say it back—I know words are hard for him. I’m moreso concerned that I’m being stupid and irrational and I’m mad at myself for putting myself again in this position that I desperately want (to be in love) yet am so scared of. \n\nWhen I care this much about someone and they hurt me, it’s ugly. Out pops this angry, petty, bitchy, demanding version of myself that I don’t even recognize. It’s almost like I put so much trust into them that it feels like the ultimate betrayal when things go wrong (ie breakup) and I backlash. \n\nNot even sure why I’m posting this. I suppose just wondering if any other ISFJs can relate? 
19	I think it’s only normal for us to feel scared when we really love someone, because it takes awhile for us to fall in love but when we do, we fall HARD and we are aware of how much it would hurt us if it doesn’t work out the way we expected to. We hate uncertainties and we have high expectations, because we also want our feelings to be reciprocated, and the fact that your ISFP isn’t big in words of affirmation, then I think it stems from that. ISFJs are big on appreciation, affirmation, and reassurance. I’ve learned that it’s always better to ask your partner about how he really feels about you than to overthink on your own and assume things that are far from reality. 
6	Is this written by me? Kidding aside, I can fully relate to this. I have always felt this way in the few times I have been in love. To me, to love is to trust in them so much that you give them the power to hurt you but believe that they won’t willingly do so. I know you’re not looking for advice and just probably want to be heard. I am hoping that everything turns out for the best in this relationship of yours. Being in love and being loved in return is one of the most wonderful experiences one can have and you’re brave to still go on despite your fears. I’m rooting for you.
5	Being in love can definitely be a strong feeling for ISFJs. I can relate to what you said about strong feelings that need to be reciporcated. I do value being honest with someone when I have strong feelings for them. I think you guys need to have an honest conversation where you talk about how you feel so strongly about him and are wondering if he loves you back. I always love it when I help someone and they thank me for all the hard work I did. 
2	never been in love, but I know it will happen.
3	Career paths and studying	Hi guys,\n\nI'm new here and I was wondering about what kind of careers or studies people here are doing. Online I find that such a type usually becomes a medical worker, teacher or social worker. I however am studying computer science which is completely different from the "usual" things. Is this just a stereotype or am I perhaps wrongly typed? I'm mostly curious as to what other people with this type actually do :P\n\nCheers
5	I was hoping to get into Meteorology or Psychology, but i havent even got into college yet. I got some time. 
4	I am currently in my last year of undergrad. I am studying Family Studies & Human Development with a minor in Psychology. I plan to get my masters degree in Marriage & Family Therapy (MFT) & plan to use my degree for MFT.\n\nMy ISFJ friend is in mechanical engineering, which I would say is different from what typical ISFJ’s go into. However, she did express that she is unsure about her major.
2	I'll do construction for a living. Mainly heavy equipment operations.
2	I'm currently in my last semester of college studying accounting. After I graduate, I plan to get my CPA. 
1	I got a degree in commerce and took some computer science classes along the way! I plan to get my CPA eventually, become an auditor.
1	I’m a chem major, currently going for BAS. It’s going about as well as you’d expect.
1	I used to be a science teacher. Now I’m in school to become a genetic counselor 
1	pre PA biology w hopefully gerontology minor
1	I'm a Geology major. I think STEM careers are good options for us.
1	I am an ISFJ, Got my B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering and currently been working as an Electrical Engineer for 7 years.
10	Survey on Flirting behaviors and Personality	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
1	Hey I went to LA Tech too!
1	Question 15. It’s very vague and doesn’t role along with the initial profile question set. Also question 1 and 2 on the kick off have nothing in the question and or an input field. 
1	There are a number of questions on which I can't discern if you're asking about my specific opinion about, for example rules about gender roles, or if you're asking if the reader is aware of the socio-cultural norms and ideals about such topics
1	Please do let us know the results of your study, I am highly curious
1	You ask in the beginning about sexual orientation, but then ask questions about interactions with “the opposite sex.” I don’t think it should be assumed that everyone taking the survey is attracted to the opposite sex. There might be a more inclusive way to ask those questions. 
3	ENTP X ISFJ conflict	I have this ISFJ friend, initially we clicked really well and I started to let her know more about myself when most people wouldn't have the chance to. However recently she seems to be taking advantage of her knowledge about me and seems to be using it to make me feel emotionally negative.\n\nFor example: I mentioned that I do not like it when people ignore me when I am talking, and these days she purposely switches to another topic or totally doesn't reply me. I know that it was done on purpose since she was looking at me but didn't give any acknowledgement. She then goes on to intrude on my privacy by leaning in really close to look at my messages, even when I tilted my phone the other way.\n\nI used to be hurt at this behaviour, but I'm finally letting go. However, she is someone that I'll be seeing for some more years and I have no choice but to stay diplomatic. The thing is that when I start talking to her, I get sucked into our 'duality' and forget to close up, letting the cycle repeat itself.\n\nIt's a painful process, so I'm seeking advice here. What do you think about my situation? How can I take measures to prevent this from happening? 
6	Say everything straight. If you don't like X you say you don't like. ENTP/ISFJ relationship might be fun cuz you are subconscious to each other.
2	My ISFJ wife has an ENTP brother with ADHD. What helped for her was to avoid the initial reaction (which was often anger). This process wasn't easy, because these reactions were deeply rooted in youth problems. She went to therapy for this. 
2	She doesn't seem like a very nice person based on what you've written:-( I would work on not giving her any information about yourself. Focus on vague small talk or topics that don't reveal how you feel. However do so in a way that won't come off as "rude"  or "improper". You can try deflecting her questions by trying to make her do all the talking, ask about something she knows a lot about. \n\nFor an ISFJ(based on personal experience as one and what I have heard/read) information = power. 
2	Just be honest about your boundaries in this relationship. In a nice say that you want her to respect your privacy. That's honestly fucked up if she is manipulating you to get what you want. Definitely be honest about that boundary in this relationship. Also one thing we as ISFJs apperciate is compassion and reassurance. So tap into that child Fe haha. 
2	What a dirty cunt. 
5	It’s s(no)w joke! (Southern Arizona)	
2	I wanted to share another picture from yesterday. \n\nEnjoy! :)
1	Weekend Discussion Thread: Saturday night edition!	I forgot to post this earlier... Need to set myself reminders. 😑 Heh.\n\nSo what are you all up to on this fine Saturday night? I'm just driving around playing Pokemon GO a bit, then I'm heading to bed. xD\n\nAny plans for tomorrow?
3	I’m just chilling and rewatching my favorite sitcom. Tomorrow probably catch up on hw and maybe smoke pot after that 
2	Oh cool ive been playing Pokemon Go as well\n\nGot a few Clamperls and some Water types I dont see too often
2	I took a damp shower since my body hurts a little, it's very stiff. any tips?\n\ntoday its Sunday, so I'm going to just chill and watch cross country skiing on TV
2	I was voicing a friend's fanfic out loud with some of my other friends. It was honestly really fun, and I enjoyed it. 
27	Happy Friday!!! It snowed in Southern Arizona today!	
3	Thank you for this beautiful photo! I used to live in AZ and miss it.
3	Pretty! Always loved looking at pictures of snow. 
3	NIce!!!
2	Nice picture! It actually hailed in Southern California. 
2	How to stop alienate/reject people?	Like title said. I rejected too many people whole my life.
3	For me it was realizing that maybe my standards of people and myself was too high\n\nI had to lower expectations of everyone and myself that there will always be flaws to deal with\n\nStarting slow and getting more people in your life can make your group of people slowly expand just take it at your speed and start somewhere
3	How to develop my ISFJ side? [ENTP]	I'm a cold, mechanical, spontaneous, reckless, selfish, power-meandering analyst, that believes things only and only if I can do them alone for an abusive mean. (unethical heuristics)\n\nAnd even though I do not, for the heavens, want to change that, I now know I won't be able to achieve my dreams of being a good father, or even to live in society, unless I find a way to develop myself around that. I have very good relationships with children and I really care about my little sister. The problem is I cannot turn a blind eye and follow through things despite not wanting to do them or seeing no value for me in doing them. I continually downplay almost all ideas unless they are genuinely near-genius and my skeptical nature makes me see all, even genuine intentions, as something with darkness lurking beneath.\n\nBut I really want to learn how to stay focused, dependable, helpful, honorable and loving for a longer period of time, for that it's the only path to hope.\n\nIf that makes sense...
6	learn to not be so insecure with your Si, and then aspire with it.
3	Entp here, you sound so edgy lol. Just channel your inner normie and realize it's ok to have feelings, enjoy life. I got an isfj gf, we're very different but you shouldn't try channel being an isfj, just be a better Entp. Empathize with people's feelings, or at least try
2	Very easy - by hanging out with actual ISFJs. This is the quickest path to developing your own inferior and tertiary functions beyond immaturity. When you hang out together you'll absorb a lot of their behaviors and ideas that will then "fill out" your own weaker functions.
1	"I'm a cold, mechanical, spontaneous, reckless, selfish, power-meandering analyst, that believes things only and only if I can do them alone for an abusive mean."  \n\n\nHow often does this narrative repeat itself in your head throughout the day?
1	Anger. This is what often drives me to do selfless good. Everything is shit anyway so might as well be the one to actually do something about it even at my own cost. Stupid but idgaf because I'll driven by anger and disappointment.
2	ISFJ male cutting me off without explanation	hey everyone this is a throwaway acc\n\nI've known this ISFJ for about 7+ years and around a couple months ago there was a large misunderstanding where rumours were being spread that I was talking about people behind their back within our friendship group. No one really believed these rumours except him(I'd assume because he is VERY close to the person spreading them). I tried to directly message him(as we don't see each other often) with an apology(because he did seem very passive aggressive whenever I was in a  group call with him) and an explanation of the situation while asking what he thought of the situation, but all he had to respond with was a very short message of him wishing me the best, but him saying we should end it there.  \nI think that this was in an attempt to kick me out of the group(cause I do tend to isolate myself from situations)  \nHowever, this didn't end up happening and a couple weeks later we ended up having a gathering with our group.  \nThe interaction between us wasn't passive aggressive though, but rather something I found odd.  \nI found himself distancing himself from the entire group every now and then and it all seemed very unnatural?  \nI was wondering if he feels even remotely bad for cutting me off. He still interacts frequently with the person who initially spread the rumours and I don't even know if I want to message him again about the situation. Every time someone tries to ask him about the situation involving me and him he tends to just completely dismiss it(sometimes even meme it) and change the subject. It seems as if he has no reason to hate me/think i'm a bad person? Is it to do with staying loyal to the person spreading the rumours?  I'm very confused on what I should do. Is there anyway I can rekindle this friendship?\n\n&#x200B;
13	its my first post please don’t flare on me	I don’t know, maybe it’s just me and not an ISFJ thing but I just felt like getting this out of my system. \nSo I’m in my first year of university and it’s been amazing. Everyone is so great and cool. But I feel a bit behind, in a sense. Everyone seems to have something to say about the world, like politics and humanity and civil rights and stuff, things that feel very “intellectual”, if you know what I mean. I can never participate in those kinds of conversations because I can’t hold my own opinions. And I just don’t feel that I’m “educated” or “smart” enough to have those discussions. \nI’m trying to learn more about those things so I can at least understand what they’re talking about (and my introverted ass finally has an excuse to attempt joining the convo) but the more I try the more weird it feels because I’m essentially trying to be someone I’m not, if that makes any sense at all...\nIdk i guess i’m just asking for validation. anyone who’s had similar experiences?
8	First & foremost don’t beat yourself up about it!\n\nIf you haven’t traveled down the rabbit hole of “cognitive functions” I would suggest looking into it, Type in Mind seems like a very resourceful website because it breaks down each personality types cognitive functions.\n\nISFJ’s top weakest cognitive function is Ne (extroverted intuition), from what I understand, this is what sparks our curiosity & what triggers learning.\n\nSo for example my INTP boyfriend will go on about WWII or astrophysics & I kind of just sit there & listen, (frankly those topics don’t interest me), I do feel bad for not contributing to the conversation tho because I really just don’t know what to say. Or he’ll want to watch something educational & I’m like noooo 😩 haha\n\nIt’s just how our brains function, but if you feel embarrassed for not knowing as much everyone else in the group you can always do your own research on the topic & come back to continue the discussion.\n
4	>Everyone seems to have something to say about the world, like politics and humanity and civil rights and stuff, things that feel very “intellectual”\n\nTake it from someone who wasted too much time arguing about politics in 2016 - 99% of political discussions are the philosophical equivalent of gold-plated poop.  It's all just bumper sticker rhetoric and biased partisanship dressed up to sound smart so people can pat themselves on the back for being "on the right side of history".  The people who sound "smart" are often just reciting sound bites someone else came up with and don't actually have their own ideas.  This is especially true in the early years of university where 99% of people have spent their entire life living at home with little to no responsibility or real world life experience. Most conversations at this point don't even go beyond the first layer of depth to any topic since everyone's just learning these things for the first time. \n\nYou can learn a lot through active listening and asking pointed questions during these conversations.  Take your time figuring things out and let yourself be curious. But I think you just want to relate to other people who are in your shoes; my friend said the same thing to me ("how do you know all that stuff?") two years ago (age 26) and current me can confidently say I didn't actually know much at that point. I'd just spent a few months listening to conservative podcasts and reading opinion articles. 
5	I struggled with this problem in my first year of univeristy too, I felt really out place and the fact that I had SO MUCH to learn made me feel really uneasy, so that problem ended up being a terrible burden during those days. Whenever I tried to learn about something I didn't really enjoy, I couldn't keep any information in my head. But I can tell you that you'll be happier if you don't force it and just try to learn little by little all the things your environment asks you to, your years of study and the experiences you'll have to live will teach you.   \n\n\nPlus I can give you a little tip: if there's something you want to learn but it's really hard for you to do so, you can try to asociate that thing to something you actually really like. My favorite way of learning about history of the world, which was something that made me really worried because I didn't know ANYTHING, was through events on the history of film (which I had to study as a subject at uni), scenes that appeared on actual films, and music. 
3	Yeah, I think I do something familiar. Since we're like people pleasers, in a sense,  we want to get along with people and are interested in THEIR interests. However, as you said, we lose our individuality kind of because that's not who we are, really. \n\nDon't worry though, university is a big place and I'm confident that you'll find someone who has the same interests with you and can actually connect with you, mutually and not one sided. Don't lose hope! It's my first year at University as well, and it's such a big transition from high school. High school really didn't prepare me enough for University and life, haha.
3	Ah, the good old imposter syndrome. It's definitely a thing and you're not alone!! I was in the same boat back in my first year too. We meet so many new people with different areas of "expertise", knowledge, and interests so it seems like the areas we aren't as familiar with are magnified. I'm in my third year now and most, if not all, of my imposter syndrome is gone. To put it as politely as I can, people are actually way more stupid than you think lol. Now that I've made friends with the people that seemed so far and out of reach, theyre great and have inspired me to work hard. They also know that I am a competent person and have thoughtful opinions, so that put all my anxieties at ease. I hope you get through this OP, as you're definitely NOT less than those around you. It might take some time or as cliché as it sounds, just finding the "right" people.

27	How do you take it when someone doesn't like you?	I don't know if it's just me, but I've always taken it a little too personally when I realize that someone doesn't like me.  I'll feel this quiet sort of hurt, and spend time trying to contemplate why they might not like me (of course, it bugs me even more when someone dislikes me for no reason.) So other ISFJ's: how do you feel, or handle it, when someone dislikes you?
31	not well at all & i take it very personally. if im being honest, an unhealthy habit of mine is assuming that people dislike me, even friends, until we become so close that i'm absolutely positive that they don't. 
10	Yeah this can really hurt and destroy my confidence or ego. It's hard for me not to take this personally. How I handle this is by realizing that you can only do so much to get people to like you and in life there are going to be people that dislike you. Also, I try to figure out why they don't like me so I can improve if necessary or if I think what they are saying is inaccurate I'll ignore/tune them out. I know we as ISFJs can be super friendly and kind and want other people to like us. Spend time with people that love you can remind you that you are a great person.\n\nEdit: this article talks about ways this is a common issue for Fe users and what to do about it https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2018/09/06/why-infjs-isfjs-enfjs-and-esfjs-struggle-to-let-go-of-bad-things/
10	I don’t handle it well at all, it shatters my already frail confidence. On some level I do think I deserve it because who could like me, I’m not interesting. 
5	I take it very personally and proceed to avoid that person. 
5	I'll try to logic my way around why and if I can't, it bothers me more. Like I'm still wondering why a receptionist I walked past yesterday gave me the glare of death. I keep reminding myself that feelings aren't always rational. 
2	It used to be the case that it bothered me and made me feel that I had done something wrong. Then I would forever feel ill at ease around that person and would make a special effort to try and change their opinion of me.  \n\nThat has changed as I have gotten older (I’m 43 now). Some switch flipped around the time I turned 40 and now IDGAF anymore.  \n\nIt’s liberating.  
2	You know when they have insecurity issues that they have to project it on someone smh like the perso  who doesnt like me\n\nI just dont pay attention to them nor be aware that they exist 💀💀💀\n\n
2	I was hurt in the beginning but I've gotten over it. I've had best friends turn their back on me as well. That really made me question myself for a while.
2	Terribly. I already tend to assume everyone hates me (arrgh) so apparent  evidence for that crushes me
2	Hurt initially, but I can let go, kinda accept it.. I don't expect people to like me, infact I am shocked if someone says they like me, but still it hurts me when someone doesn't like me, I've improved a lot over the years though, I can let go.. but then I tend to feel very self-conscious around them. I don't want to be a bother, more than anything.
2	It doesn't bother me that much. I get a bit internally sassy and then I just avoid them.
1	when it happens, I get a little bit down.
1	It bothered me when I was younger. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt doesnt really bother me at all now that im older (when I hit late 20s / early 30s)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just dont really care what a lot of people think anymore and why should I? I cant control that. 
5	What do you guys think about following careers?	[IAS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Administrative_Service)\n\n[Banking](http://careerwiki.in/courses/career-as-a-bank-po/)\n\nI am basically lost. I don't enjoy anything. I am a science student but going for engineering don't seem a good choice cause I feel a bit lacking on technical side. I can easily solve problems which I have attempted before but on seeing a new sort of problem gets me a nervous breakdown.\n\nI want to know opinion of you guys about above mentioned jobs as these are the top premium career option in my country. And I will be taking risk which I am willing to risk. 
2	I studied electrical engineering and ended up in a career where I'm doing a lot more project/people management than I do technical work. I can't say I loved engineering when I studied it, but I do really enjoy what I do now, but I definitely did not expect myself to end up doing what I do now (working in construction)\n\nMy advice is to go for as many opportunities you can now so you can see what you do and don't enjoy.
2	Follow your heart. Even if it means giving in the financial comfort; doing something you love will more than make up for it. 
2	I'm an ISFJ going to school for radiation therapy. I really enjoy the physics behind it and know I'll be doing some math in my career while also working directly with patients. This field attracted me because of the patient interaction (I was previously studying chemistry and realized that no part of me wants to work in isolation in a lab) and strong physics background it requires. My first test was creating a radiation treatment plan for breast cancer which was super satisfying to figure out like a puzzle and in my day-to-day career I'll be executing these plans moreso than creating them but it's important to understand the physics nonetheless. A lot of science has applications in the medical field (highly suggested for ISFJs)  such as medical/nuclear physics, pharmacology, etc. Explore some areas and rule out what you don't want:)
3	"Offense to Truth"	
16	What is a trait that you posses as an isfj, that you wouldn’t want to pass down to your children?	
39	criticising myself so much that i lose all confidence and ruin my life for myself \n\n\n*laughs* 
41	Lack of assertiveness and weak boundaries, as well as being too strict with own preferences to the extent than I can get irritated if something doesn't go as planned
17	focusing so much on making sure that everyone else is okay that i don't help myself when i need to.
17	Taking things far too personally bc I demand a high level of respect 
8	My difficulty in handling other people disliking me - I know that I can't gain everyone's approval, but it brings my self-esteem down a pang every time I realize someone doesn't like me. 
17	always forcing what's moral behaviour down others throat and being so controlling sometimes
5	My high level of defensiveness when people are only joking.
3	My unhealthy Fe :((
3	Avoiding conflict to the point where I lost friendships and relationships instead of dealing with it. 
6	Insights needed: Signs of disinterest	So, I have this female crush who admitted that she's an ISFJ.  We are friends but our communication are very much limited to texts only. We did hang out in group and met one-to-one (her initiative) but the purpose of the meeting is only to pass her some study books.\n\nRight now, we're texting each other frequently. The content of the conversation are mostly her sharing of job seeking experience and asking for career advice. I spoke some silly things to her as well and she responded with laughters.\n\nMy only struggle in texting her is only one thing: sometimes she replied me quickly and sometimes the reply came in 5-8 hours interval and sometimes she didn't reply me at all.\n\nI wanted to know in general is ISFJ is:\n- generally friendly to everyone like she is to me\n- giving me hints that I should back off from texting her too much through slow replies/ no reply (signs of no interest).\n\nKindly advise me because I wanted to know the rough picture of the situation I'm in. I do not want to push her too much if she's not interested in me.
5	To provide a counter note, I rarely respond immediately to people who aren’t my boss. Sometimes this means I am comfortable with them, and sometimes that I am trying to make a good impression and it’s hard to decide what to say. Other data? 
6	If she’s backing off it means you’re showing too much interest and to slow it down. She likes you, but be more friendly than flirty. We take it at a glacial pace
3	Like the others I will reply asap if interested EXCEPT:\n\n1. if I want to craft perfect response because I don't know person well yet OR\n\n2. if I'm worried the other person will freak out/feel imposed upon if I do. If you've given even the slightest hint of annoyance etc in the past this might be at play.\n\nI'd suggest hanging out in a group again if at all possible and seeing how she treats you vs everyone else. That might be a clearer indication.
2	I’m consistent about replying to people I like ASAP. So if I don’t I’m either literally off the grid, or I don’t want to talk to you anymore.
2	I can go several hours to a day without replying to my boyfriend and close friends, and much longer with people I don't know well. I just need a lot of space and it's something they've had to accept. 🤣If she replies and sounds enthusiastic then you may still have a chance. I would definitely not press the issue and let her reply on her own terms. Best of luck!
2	we try to answer everyone, but to me; it either sounds like she's super busy or not interested.
1	Check out my new (android) dating app for MBTI and Enneagram communities!	
3	Funniest jokes	What are the funniest jokes & puns that have made you laugh?\n\nWhat typically makes you laughs uncontrollably?
11	I like jokes that are a mix of silly and not making sense or clever but not too forced in either direction\n\nMy humor is probsbly also more mean/savage than youd expect from an ISFJ, I just have to hide it outside close friends or else not many people would like me
6	My humor is saying off the wall shit or watching people get roasted on. I also love morbid humor too!
3	My humor can be a combination of silly and dark lol. I like sitcoms when the characters do things that don't make sense One of my favorite comedies is South Park for the reason that the humor is silly and dark like I enjoy. 
9	Attempted explanation at Si?	While Se sees data points of "this surface is brown, it's hard, it is about the size of my ass, it has a perpendicular piece attached to the back," Si is creating a reason for why Se is seeing these things. The reason being "the object is a yew chair" and attached to that is a model of what a chair is(a supporting structure comprised of a hard base and a hard back). While Se is observing "brown and hard, and has a certain pattern on the surface" Si has summed all of these properties up by labeling the thing "yew wood." Similarly as much data as Se takes in about the structure of the object should relate all back and be explained by the fact that it is a chair.
7	Some notes I took/found a while ago\n\nSi (ISxJ dom, ESxJ aux, INxP teritary, EnxP inferior)\n-Retaining [To continue to use/practice an old custom]\n\n-Temperate [Moderate, Not extreme in opinion]\n-Indirect [???]\n\n-Impressionistic [Tends to judge things based on immediate objects/actions without attention to detail]\n\n-Habitual [Comfortable with sticking to things they already do]\n\n-Knowing [???]\n\n-Be one with ageless customs that i known even if what is reliable changes\n\n-Will experience something then quickly compare to stored memories in mind\n\n-Can easily detect if something doesn't match ip with what they are used to\n\n-Recall [Likes to think of things of how they remember they should be]\n\n-Takes relevant sense and compares with previous occurrences\n\n-Constantly comparing things and how they used to/should be\n\n-(dom/aux) Focused, traditional, realisitic\n\n-(dom/aux) Much less about experience things\n\n-(dom/aux) Go with traditional, what they are used to and "right" way to do things\n\n-(dom/aux) Enjoy being in positions to follow routine and used to\n\n\n\nSi\n\n\n- reoccurrence\n- Keep a tidy mental library\n- What I already see and know is the easiest way for me to develop an opinion on something.\n- What is different?\n- over-concern with realistic experience in order to repress unruly imagination\n\n
3	I think I agree for my personal experience. \n\nI used to believe I had aphantasia because I couldn’t look at a memory or mental image and be able to answer things like “what color was the chair?” I realize now, it’s because the key thing I’m aware of is the impression of chairness it left on me. \n\nSo when I’m reading a book describing something, I’m not seeing a movie being played out with all the sensory details. I’m kind of sensing the impressions the character has about their surroundings. If I had to draw that scene, I would have to sound out the exact sensory details-try out different colors of chair until one had the right impression. 
1	...what?
4	A question for ISFJs	Hello, I'm a friendly neighborhood INFJ who has an inquiry based on our similar function stacks. We both share, if one is familiar with the theory, an incredible weakness in the 7th function; it can be called the blindspot, Polr, trickster, whatever really. Without it Ti is given free reign, and from there it prevents one from seeking out and caring for the facts of this world; it would rather rely on it's own methods(in theory.) In the INFJ one would give fantasy free reign and dominion over the mind, leading to dreams and visions of how a better world could be brought about. However, given the nature of Te it's unbelievably impractical, immeasurable, overly perfectionistic, and it leaves one with a pass/fail mindset in tasks. I imagine such fantasies, as they stem from some "underlying universal pattern", are product of an INFJ's Ni, but I'm unsure how it would manifest in an ISFJ- could you help me out? Is it the same thing minus the universal pattern part?\n\nSo yeah, maybe just explain some things that happen in your life that you think link Si without Te? Maybe there's a video that helped you understand it? Anything would be appreciated, thank you for your time.
2	I’ve always been allergic to Te. I don’t think about it, and it bites me in the ass. I despise the simple linkage between act/physical form and reality. I fear that kind of work above all else. Engaging in Te is deciding to engage in a mockery of what’s real-to me, Si and Ti- and engaging in the disgusting world of working towards a concrete goal. I despise workout plans, affirmation meditation, the bureaucratic pea cockery of job applications and fake interpersonal work dynamics. Information meetings, filling out tax forms, taking an overwhelming task one step at a time. \n\nI think Fe is the only thing holding me together sometimes. I don’t want to engage, but if someone else wants me to do something, I do it- and suddenly I am in the universe again. 
1	Jet's MBTI - Cast Podcast	Hey Reddit, my name is jetplane48 (ESTP 7w8 sx/sp) and I am starting up a podcast in relation to MBTI. Fundamentally, the goal of the podcast is to educate the viewers of several Typology systems through a series of one-on-one's with others who are interested in the same topics. I have been conducting interviews for many years (MBTI related) and this is just an extension of that, however, I want to discuss topics that the audience wants me to cover. Naturally, I'll come up with my own material but I would love to explore topics that others have in mind. I am busy with school for the next few months but when I finish, the goal is to eventually be more consistent with these podcast uploads if this turns out to be popular enough. I'm very excited to get this started, and let's see some questions!\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg)
5	Is it actually possible to love yourself as ISFJ?	something something 6th function/critic.
2	6th?
2	In regards to the question, yes, definitely, by proving yourself repeatedly that you are worth it. Of course every thing I don't do as right as I could kinda puts me down but then I look at myself and compare to the people around me and that makes me feel better because I can see some big differences in my favor (earned through efforts of course). Maybe not the kindest thing to do but it works for me. 
8	INTJ trying to make an ISFJ friend open up	Hello! I am an INTJ [21M] and I have this friend ISFJ [20F] who a while back told me she had a bad weekend and is dealing with this 'self crisis'. I do have a lot of interest in her, and I'm intrigued by the way she thinks and by all means I wanted to help and understand her. But when I asked about it, she deflected and avoided the topic alltogether. I know it's hard for her to just open up like that so I didn't push further when I saw she didn't want to give any details. At that point, we were not too close either, more like friendly acquaintances if even that, so I had no reason to continue on the matter.\n\nCouple weeks passed, we ended up talking a lot more. I could tell she enjoyed my company and on numerous occasions she was the one who initianed the conversation (which is totally out of her character, but she is definitely making an effort for our little friendship to work). On the other hand, I also enjoy it as I find people with a different view than me especially intriguing. \n\nThen yesterday, after a short chit-chat she tells me she had another bad day. Now at this point I am confused, worried and the curiosity is burning me inside. From my point of view, you don't go around telling someone you had a bad day without being at least a little bit enclined to share it. Therefore I assumed she wants attention. Furthermore, as I said, I do want her to share what's in her mind with me so I can get more insight in who she is and possibly help her or at the very least give her some feedback, yet again, to my surprise, when I asked her about it, she changed the subject instantly. I told her that she can be open with me, yet to be fair, I might not have been very clear.\n\nNow, my question for you ISFJs out there is if I should keep pushing considering I really want to know what's going on and understand her, or just let it go and give her some space. Rationally, she being an ISFJ, the reasonable choice would be to let her deal with her stuff despite that being against my interests if I don't want to end up dismissed by her. Though I can not ignore the fact that she was the one that bringed up the bad day in the first place.\n\nSo how can I go about her opening up? Is she not comfortable enough yet? \nWould you mention something personal to a friend without actually wanting to discuss that thing or go into details about it?
4	Often times when I say I had a bad day to a friend, I don’t want to talk about bc I feel that talking about myself seems selfish. She most likely is telling you that bc she wants you to know she’s having an emotionally down day, and maybe you can cheer her up. But it certainly is a way of her telling you to get that she may not be herself bc of it. A big part of her not telling you is that she may be afraid she can’t fully trust that you won’t share it to others or that you won’t judge her. She wants to share her pain, but spare you the details. I would emphasize that you care about her and she should be able to spill out to you bc you’d never betray her. I would only emphasize asking again if you made sure to let her know you want to be there for her. \n\nAlthough, I find concern in you saying you’re “curious” about her issues, which to me, as an ISFJ translates more to wanting to know rather than actually caring, and she may be picking up on that. \n
5	keep asking her if she wants to talk about anything, or if something is bothering her. "it might feel better talking to someone about it." but don't keep pushing if she says no.\nyou're a good friend,! she's lucky to have you!!
6	I would try gently asking her about it. Like the next time she mentions having a bad day, say something along the lines of, "What happened? Do you want to talk about it?" And that may encourage her to open up. Sometimes when I mention having a bad day I want to talk about it and sometimes I don't. If it's with someone I'm interested in, then I'm more inclined to talk about it when prompted. But that's just me- take this with a grain of salt!
2	INTP here. I can confirm my ISFJ girlfriend says this to me also. Def. an ISFJ thing. They get caught in the same over thinking kinda loop that INTPs do.  She's never told me what it means, but I know they dwell on the past, and I suspect she may be over analysing sad things. :(\n\nI too would like to know what it's about, so that I can understand her better and make sure she has what she needs. 
2	First and foremost, be honest with her. Tell her you want her to open up. Try to figure out why you want that, and also tell that to her.\n\nSecond, you might want to tell her that it's important for HER to open up, not for you in the first place. But don't push her because that way she might end up in defense mode. You might even want to tell that it doesn't have to be with you, but telling how she feels will relief so much for her. The fact that you tell her so might increase your chances that that person is you. This part takes a lot of patience. \n\nLast, try to be open yourself. This has a contagious effect. This might be a tricky one because you're not a feeler but there are feelings in there somewhere so go find them.\n\nBest of luck,\n\nAn INTP
1	i don’t know about the others, but in that context, i’d avoid the subject afterwards cause i’d be afraid of possible judgement from him/her (fi critic, ne inf). personally, i would want the person to show that he/she rlly does care and would not judge. that would signal the “ok” for me to share, to make sure that i’m not “burdening” him/her. u can do this by sharing ur problems first, then requesting for her to share hers too. kind of like a transaction? but more like assuring her that u feel close enough. \n\nand tip: after she shares her problem, reassure her that u understand and are not judging her for it. reaffirm this regularly for as long as u are still friends/wtv relationship u have with her. (u probably don’t have to try too much, considering the very good compatibility. that strong-ish fi should be able to curb this!)\n\ni don’t know if this’ll help. but best of luck 
5	just a daily application post for you guys!	this comes from a fellow isfj, and just reading your comments , seeing how you choose to Express yourself through words makes me smile! you guys are a big bunch of sweethearts! this sub never fails to brighten up my day, or improve my mood. you're like .. fellow teddy bears that needs to be protected at all costs. we are  so busy taking care of our close ones, but we also need to be taken care of once in a while. the best feeling, is just getting cared for when I'm down!\n\ndo you agree?
5	this is so sweet! i've been so happy to have this sub lately. i feel so understood reading through answers, they're so thoughtful and kind. i've been telling myself that i need to do a better job of voicing my needs and taking care of myself - neither of which i do that well. so i definitely agree!!
3	Neglecting an ISFJ	Hi, I am a 21 year old INTJ (guy) and my best friend is an ISFJ (girl). It's only been about 5 months since we met but we are already super close. I mean really close. I should say that we only have met twice in real life and that was during two inter-university event and yes she is from another university. Despite that we used to communicate everyday via phone or text. We never used to start our day without wishing each other 'Good Morning' and never end our day without saying 'Good Night/ Sweet dreams' . Our conversations may extend upto 5-6 hours each day. It's been the most fulfilling few months of my life as far as human relationships go. The thing is recently my grades have been gradually falling. Every time I try to open my books my thoughts wander of to the conversations that we had and I would mostly be looking forward to have our next conversation. I thought this was problematic and I talked about this to her and I told her that I was taking a kinda long break from social media and texting, including the chats with her.\n\nNow it has been about 30 days since we last talked. Even though I said I wanted to take a break from Social Media I used to stalk her stories and her profile almost every single day. Today I saw that she had posted some sad pictures about stuff like 'letting someone you love go'. She never acted like this and I attempted to contact her on messenger. It seemed that I couldn't find her. I had a crazy thought that she was referring to me when she posted those pics and she had deleted her fb profile. I kinda knew if she was upset about me she would not pick up my phone and so used a spare number to contact her. She picked up and she seemed really detached. I talked to her for about 30 minutes trying to cheer her up and asking her why she seemed upset. After a while her spirits seemed to rise and she began responding well. Before we hanged up she asked me to accept her friend request on facebook because we got accidently 'unfriended' when she deactivated her account. That was when it hit me that she might have actually blocked me since simply deactivating your account will never remove any of your friends.\n\nI am very much surprised about how all this turned out. She is probably my favorite person right now on earth and I have always found her to be very level headed and emotionally very mature. I never expected her to block me in my wildest dreams let alone be super upset about me apparently 'neglecting' her for a month. It puzzles me very much why she did not even attempt to message me even once if she felt neglected. I thought I had perfectly communicated with her regarding my need to find some space to take back my lost grades. I had promised her that I would get back to her once I got my life back on track. What surprised me the most is after this occurred I feel that she constantly **has** to be in touch with people that are closest to her, whereas I am perfectly fine with not communicating with my close friends (or even my family) for extended periods and being able to connect effortlessly later without the need for any such drama.\n\nI would very much appreciate your valuable take on how I should have behaved in this situation and what to do to not let her become upset again. I really like this girl and it means so much to me.\n\nThank you :)

3	I’m an ISFJ (18, F) and a very similar thing happened to me with an INTJ (17, M) who used to be my best friend. I’m pretty sure I can tell you what’s happening.\n\nISFJs are extremely sensitive and INTJs can be insensitive, so sometimes that can cause some problems (like the one you’re having). You may have explained quite logically why you need to cut contact with her for a bit, but if that happened to me, my thoughts would start spiraling. Let me explain.\n\nISFJs are extremely loyal, but also doubtful of their friends’ affection. It’s just an irrational fear a lot of us had. So when you told her that you needed to stop talking to her for a bit, that probably fed right into that fear. She probably began thought spiraling about whether or not you really liked her, analyzing your conversations for signs that you don’t actually want to be her friend, and just feeling rejected. That’s how I would react anyway.\n\nWhen my INTJ rejected me, I did what she did on social media. I never actually blocked or unfollowed him, but I posted some sad stuff about letting people go and being hurt by people. Honestly, I was hoping that he would see the posts, recognize that he was hurting me, and ask me about it.\n\nThe reason that she got distant with you is because she wanted you to chase her. She feels very hurt, confused, and doesn’t really trust you right now. She wants you to prove that you actually do care about her by showing her some attention. She’s thinking that if she removes all her effort from the equation and then you start putting some in, that’s evidence that you actually do care. Until she’s satisfied by the amount of effort you’re putting in and thereby convinced that you actually like her, she’ll be distant because she doesn’t want to risk hurting herself again.\n\nI know you may have logically explained your motives for not wanting to talk with her so much, but we’re human, so we don’t always have logical reactions. I can tell you, however, that we’re very forgiving (at least, I am) and if you just talk with her about it and put in some time and effort, things will go back to the way they were before. Good luck!!\n\n
2	Talk to her. Tell her how you feel. I honestly believe you didn't try to hurt her.
7	Weekend Discussion Thread of February 15-17: Snowmageddon Edition!	Yes folks, it's time for another one of these! My rambling below is not important though, feel free to ignore it and start your own discussion lol.\n\nSo, we've been hit with a TON of snow up where I am, far more than usual. And my landlord has been incompetent at getting the snow removal guy out, which means I've gotten stuck in the driveway more than once. I had to call CAA this morning because I got stuck with my back wheels off the ground and I was two hours late to work. Also, yesterday I got stuck in my friend's driveway and burned up my tires.\n\nSo this morning the landlord told me the plow guy can't come until tomorrow at the earliest. Well, the windrows left by the city plows are easily 2 feet high in the worst parts, and I didn't own a shovel, plus there were none on the property (I searched). I borrowed a shovel from a neighbour this morning and cleared a little path. This afternoon I came home from work and the city plows had pushed the snow up like I wasn't even there this morning, so I kept on driving and went to Canadian Tire. Bought one of those ice breaker sticks and a small shovel as well as some salt and some engine oil (unrelated, wanted to top it up). Returned home, parked on the street, went to pick up my friend, went to Lowe's and bought a more intense shovel. Came home and shoveled for an hour. We made a car sized path to get into the driveway, and I got in with only some back and forthing required.\n\nWe were going to go to a pub but called it quits because shoveling tired us out. Oh well. Now the other neighbour with a car just came home and got stuck, in the driveway though so at least he's there and not stuck on the street so he won't get a ticket, but I'm not able to get out again until either the plow guy comes, this guy leaves, or I shovel my way out. He's using the shovels/ice thing I left outside now to try to get unstuck. I asked him if he wanted help but he said no, he's fine.\n\nThe driveway fits ten cars (five by two) so it was no easy feat to clear out space. I left a big mountain in the middle of the driveway because it was too difficult to throw the snow up onto the person-high piles that already exist by the curb.\n\n/tipsy ranting
3	How was Valentine's day for you guys? Mine was spent alone. 
3	In the past 3 weeks, I've had school cancelled 6 times and delayed 3 times. Due to the way we also do things at my school, i dont have to make a single one of those days up. Whenever we get a snow day called, the work is put online and that's counted as our school day. \nI honestly find delays worse than school getting cancelled now. \n\nAnd in other news i had a physics test and precalculus test on Thursday. Passed the physics with a 90% and the precalculus with an 80%. Happy about both ^^ 
9	Tinder mess!	I \[27F\] ENFJ met my so called bf \[29M\] ISFJ three weeks ago on Tinder, and we decided to date exclusively -his idea!\n\nWe both deleted Tinder app and decided to try to make things between us work!\n\nYesterday we were watching a video on his phone, and Tinder notifications popped up, he lied and said it is the phone problem and he does not know why the App still there, I asked him immediately to open the f\*\*\*ing app, was 22:00, and found a conversation that started 21:00 while he was on my bed after a great movie night out, he was sending 'hi' everywhere to random girls!\n\nI felt stupid to be in that situation! I felt hurt and I feel shit now! if someone could cry until die; I would be writing this from the grave!\n\nWhat to do?\n\n\*\*TL;DR;\*\* :\n\nDo you think if I continue with him he will do it again? or it is just 'mistake' as he said frankly!\n\nDo you think once a 'Tinder' user you would not quit and settle ? cause you know 'the sea is full of fish'!
33	End it. It's not worth it. Real talk.
15	In my (potentially unpopular) opinion, Tinder is not even remotely the kind of place you should look for exclusive relationships.  This guy says he doesn't feel safe in a relationship unless he's having sex within 3 weeks which is just ridiculous.  Based on the little I've seen in this post, I think this guy just wants to get laid with minimal effort and only asked for exclusivity in the hopes it'd move him towards that goal.\n\nI say dump him and Tinder if you're looking for something meaningful.
10	He lied and he isn't willing to be open with you. That's not something that can change right away. It is serious stuff rooted in who he is and what he sees in you. And it is clear he doesn't respect you or see you as someone worth being honest/direct with.\n\nLet him go. He isn't interested and will only drag on juggling between not respecting you while wanting to find someone else and lying to you to avoid conflict.\n\nFind someone better and better for you.
11	If he lies about tinder, you might as well get out while you can. The dudes probably lying to get laid. Nobody lies about deleting tinder like that unless they got some plan. 
7	after THREE WEEKS he's already lying to you? boy, bye. he's a grown-ass adult, there's no excuse.
4	Behaviour is repetitive; past behaviour almost always predicts future behaviour. I’d bet money on it happening again. You deserve better than that. 
3	It would be different if he owned up to it, but the fact that he tried to play it off is a no go.
3	Either he feels you're going to break things off with him at some point, or he hasn't been open about how he feels about you. I suggest talking it out. As an ISFJ, if I feel safe in a conversation, I'm more willing to share thoughts I typically keep to myself.
1	I dont think this really relates to ISFJs. He's just a lying selfish scumbag that isnt worth your time!
6	What would be the point of you having an INTJ aeound?	There's an obvious pattern of me going places, meeting someone, becoming their friend, and then realizing they are an ISFJ. I think they like me because of my ability to give them intuitive insight that they simply cannot derive from a situation themselves, in addition to other aspects of me such as my work ethic. I feel a bit bad that ISFJs are so trusting because the ones I've known have gotten into abusive situations in the past and continue to make that mistake as we speak (despite me saying that the person is terrible and predicting their behavior accurately, oof). I also appreciate the quality immensely however, because a lot of people are weary of me and INTJs in general I imagine.\n\nThose are my reasons, what are yours?
5	I have an interesting relationship with my INTJ friend. We have known each other for almost 20 years. She simultaneously intimidates and impresses me. I look up to her and I think she looks up to me too. We get along very well and enjoy talking about the people in our lives. Like some other old friends, I am nervous to impress her when we meet after it’s been a while. But then talking with her is effortless as usual. I don’t know why I get nervous. 
4	My INTJ friend makes no judgements, but has high expectations of me - and as an ISFJ, it makes me want to work that much harder to meet them because I know that he believes in my potential. And for me personally, that’s the kind of pressure I need to push me to be better. \n\nYou’re dead on about the intuitive insight - something I know that I lack, but his point of view really helps when I need to remove emotions from decision making and in turn after reviewing the situation, I’ve made better choices. It’s a quality I’ve found truly invaluable!
3	My boyfriend is an INTJ. I have a tremendous amount of respect for his work ethic and even though it’s super annoying when he works on something for hours because it has to be just right, I admire him for it. I’m sensitive and want to have my feelings validated, which he doesn’t always understand - until I directly tell him I need him to validate my feelings. He doesn’t understand why I get wrapped up in my clients cases but I have a tender heart and he knows it. I think that’s what he values in me. I think he understands that the need for me to help others is just gonna be there no matter what. He’s quiet too, which allows me to babble on while we’re together. He’s the one I spill everything to. Mostly because he sits there and listens intensely and absorbs all of it.\n\nI’ve just learned to get straight to the point and be semi mechanical when I need him to understand something. I’ve also learned to pay close attention to what he does for me to show me he loves me instead of what he says because he’s awful at the sweet compliments. But man when he does get one out I value the hell out of it.
52	Definitely belongs to our over analyzing personality type.	
6	WAITTT lmao sameeeee, the thinking and crossing to walk parallel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProbably why I'm gonna stay single ripp. Confidence negative percent, and I don't want to be perceived as a weirdo by her because I'm probably making her uncomfortable even though she probably doesn't even care.
4	True.

1	sometimes.. but often not
3	It's been 3 years and I don't know what I am waiting for	English isn't my main language so if you guys think that my writings are funny that cud be the reason. Soo yea, I have been friends with an ENFP guy for 4 years now and have started to fall for him since 3 years ago.  I'm 100% sure he knows how I feel (I told him & also hinted to him numerous time) but the thing is, he never respond to this. He is always silent when it comes to this topic and I know "no respond is also a respond" but I feel like without a proper closure, I'd just keep thinking there could be a "what if" between us. He is a good friend and he helped me alot during my tough times so I do appreciate him for that. I am not sure if his "silent respond" is to prevent himself from saying anything that could hurt my feelings. \n\nAlso he is not showing any typical ENFP traits that could mean he has feelings for me...for example \n\n* He never compliments me. Not even once though. When I ask him about this he'd just say I shouldn't fish for compliments and that I should make myself feel good, no need others to do that \n* He love teasing/making fun of me. Literally anything I said can become a joke/tease by him. Its not like an insult or what though, more like harmless fun. \n* He'll help me whenever I need it. He never force me to tell him the whole story too, he'd just jump in and help out when I need it or ask for it. \n* He listens to everything I said and give me his comment after. \n\nHonestly I don't know what to do. Should I really give up on our friendship just so I can let go of the feelings? I think I need a closure from him but I feel like that's not something I'd ever get from him. I feel like am not ready to date other guys either cause I always feel something is missing from them or am comparing him to other guys. \n\nCan someone wake me up perhaps? \n\n&#x200B;
1	>He never compliments me\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe's just not that into you (hug) You've been friends for 4 years and he's never made any romantic moves towards you. ENFP men are not shy like isfjs are, they will not sit on the sidelines for 3-4 years without saying/showing that they like you\n\n&#x200B;
1	I think you need to flat out tell him “i've been falling for you for the last 3 years, is there any chance something could happen between us?”\n\nMaybe your advances aren't as obvious to him as they are to you. Or maybe he really isnt interested, but i think having him tell you that flat out will help you find closure. What's the point in pining over him if he's made it clear nothing will happen? So i think you should just let it all out and see what he says.
21	I somehow get so offended when someone makes fun of something I like.	Hear me out here. I think it has to do with a few things: if I really like something, I've done my research and have determined that it's the best option for me at this time. Then I think it's also just good old fashioned sensitivity. 😅 Anyone else?
13	Which is maybe one of the reasons we tend to be a bit private?
11	Yeah it often feels like a personal attack on who I AM because I don’t soften feel super attached to those things. It’s almost territoriality. I too read a lot about what I like \n\nEdit: often, not soften 
6	Omg this is totally me too. It’s annoying. Wish I could detach.
3	agreed! 
3	it used to bother me and i'd spend time to figure out why that something else is better or how i missed it. often it'd be people talking out of their ass.\n\nso now i have become indifferent towards the comments. its kinda sad because it's making me closed toward certain experiences.
2	How common is this, really?
2	My isfj boyfriend is the same 😂
3	My wife and I are going to the library. She’s an ISFJ and would like a suggestion from a fellow ISFJ for a book to pick up. Any suggestions?	Title says it all 
1	I like non-fiction books but when I was teenager I liked thrillers. I cannot say for the rest of ISFJ family tho.
1	The entire girl with a dragon tattoo series 
1	The Help\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird\n\nThe Kite Runner\n\nRebecca\n\nThe Boy With The Striped Pyjamas \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI enjoyed all of the above massively
16	how do i use Fe-Ti properly	Fe doesn’t feel natural to me. i have the urge to help others, and also have empathy for them, but i can quickly switch it off immediately making me very cold in a instant. when i try to act on my Fe, it feels awkward and tiring. \n\ni think i’m in a Si-Ti loop at the moment. i’ve seen the other post made about it but am still unsure about how to use Fe to break it.
9	In Socionics Fe is our “tool” function (everyone’s 2nd function is). So it makes sense you’d be able to switch it off. This is common with me. In the moment I can pull Fe out and be that sweet and charming with a hint of modesty (typical Si/Fe combo), but once I’m alone I just turn it off. It’s a bit of a chore to use on my end as well, even though I enjoy it at the same time. I think his is normal to varying degrees for isfjs (or any type with their 2nd function).
6	Check out These two links it provides solid information about how to use Auxilary Fe and Tertiary Ti properly.\n\n[https://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/theory](https://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/theory)\n\n[https://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/121692868877/how-functions-work-auxiliary-fe-isfjinfj](https://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/121692868877/how-functions-work-auxiliary-fe-isfjinfj)\n\n&#x200B;
6	ISFJs what is your enneagram tritype?	My tritype is 9w1 2w1 5w6\n\nIf you don't know what your tritype is you can take a test on it here\n\n[http://enneagramuserguide.com/enneagram-tests/tritype-wing](http://enneagramuserguide.com/enneagram-tests/tritype-wing)\n\n&#x200B;
3	Don't remember my whole tritype. It gets complicated. I know one of my types is 6, but it seems to me more to be that I tend to be in a state of disintegration, so tritype just seems more complex than it needs to be for me. The main type is an effective enough descriptor for me. It has helped me better think about my relationships with the people around me. Enneatype 9 seems to correlate strongly with introverted sensors.
2	1w2
2	What is enneagram tritype?
1	I got 6w5-1w9-4w5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI find myself getting 6w5 alot on multiple websites, haha.
1	1w2-2w1-6w7\n\nI always get different answers every single time I try to take an enneagram test, but that’s what I got from your link 
1	9-5-4\n likely Enneagram Tritype with wings is: 9w1-5w6-4w5
1	I got 2w1, 1w9, and 7w6. I don't actually know what this means though.
1	I’m a 9 too! Somewhat balanced but closer to a 1 wing I think.
1	ISFJ is my most often type but I think I’m borderline on the functions. With that caveat, my enneagram is almost always type 6.
1	4w3, 9w1, 5w4

1	1w2. I love to be right and I love to help. Don’t know beyond that yet.
10	Weekend of February 8 to 10 - Discussion Thread: Get to know each other!	Hey everyone~\n\nIt's time for another discussion thread! Since it's now evening where I am, I decided it was time to post this. So, here we go. I guess you can just talk about anything you want. Let's all become friends here!\n\n:)
14	Hi everyone! I'm about to graduate from college in May so I'm pretty anxious about it all. There's nothing particularly interesting about me, but I'd like to think that I'm an approachable person.
10	Hello \n\nI am boring and my daily life basically amounts to:\n-Eat cereal for breakfast\n-Go to work\n-Eat lunch\n-Finish work\n-eat dinner\n-Play video games/watch anime/go on discord\n-Sleep\n\nOn weekends swipe out work for more hobbies and maybe once every month or 2 hang out with friends\n\nHow are you guys?
10	For me personally, I work full time but also have three close friends I see regularly. One of them a few times a week on average, and the other two are a couple and we hang out maybe 3-4 times a month. I kind of want to change that, though.\n\nThen I also volunteer for a local animal shelter and soon also for a social services organization in my community that helps low income families in need. :) I start the second one next week!\n\nI also have a cat and several fish tanks. I also like to read, sometimes write, and occasionally do something artsy like paint. And I play Pokemon Go, which keeps me busy sometimes when it's not freezing cold out!\n\nRight now I'm sitting on the couch watching Salvation. I'm in the middle of making Nanaimo bars, but I have to wait for the base mixture to cool before I can add the next layer!
9	Hi everyone! I’m pretty simple. I work full time and spend my free time eating, working out, spending time with my family, and reading. I’m really routine in my day-to-day but really enjoy that. ☺️ 
7	Yay!!! I’m so excited that we’re doing this! 😇\n\nHi Everyone!\n\nI’m a 22 year old ISFJ (F) & I guess the most interesting thing about me is I have Congenital Nystagmus (visual impairment). I have night blindness as well as horrible depth perception. It’s difficult for me to read 12 point font or to see license plates/street signs. With the technology of bi-optics I will be able to learn how to drive !!\n\nI’m in my last year of my undergrad (Family Studies & Human Development with a minor in Psychology) & will hopefully be moving by this time next year to pursue my Masters degree. Once I’ve completed my schooling I would like to use my degree for Marriage & Family Therapy. \n\nCurrently I am working on undergrad research with one of my professors on food & housing insecurity among college students.\n\nFor one of my Major classes I am working on developing some sort of workshop/training/career day that focuses on educating students K-12th grade on visual impairments as well as providing them with tools that they can use to advocate for accessibility for people with visual impairments (eventually I would love for this to focus around ALL disabilities, but since I am familiar with visual impairments...obviously lol...I started there)\nThere are still quite a bit of details to be hashed out, but this is the skeleton of my idea 😜\n\nMoving on...\n\nI have a cat who is about 14 years old & a red-eared slider turtle who is about 21 years old 🐢🐈💕\nIn a perfect world I’d own 5 cats, at least 2 dogs & a micro pig lol\n\nFRIENDS is hands down my favorite show & I’m usually watching beauty or lifestyle related YouTube videos.\n\nI’ve also been dating an INTP for 3 years\n\nIf you have any questions please feel free to ask :)
6	well hello there, I just woke up, and in my free time I like to ; read self help books, do skincare, read manga, be with my family and sometimes close childhood friends, be with my cat,, I like taking walks and exercise,, uwu. I am also trying to become better at reading non verbal cues!\n\ndo you ever think about how fart takes up such a big part of our lives?\n
6	I’m 24F, living with my INTP boyfriend in a different state than the one we grew up in. We both work full time. Some big changes came our way in the past two months, we had to get a new car (our old one was cost-prohibitive) and a new apartment, and he also is starting a new job. Things are changing a lot at once but we are making it work. We are celebrating our 12th anniversary next week! 
6	Hello! I'm just a 18 year old ISFJ nearly out of high school. There's really nothing extreme to say about me, I'm a pretty average person. My daily routine is: wake up, get ready for school, go to school, come home, do homework,surf reddit/watch netflix (flash and arrow atm)/listen to music/talk in my discord communities/cuddle withy cat, eat dinner, and fall asleep very easily. \n\nI have a huge passion for music, especially edm. 
5	I’m a Romance junkie. 🙄😂 Me Before You is my all-time favorite and so far nothing has absolutely torn me apart yet made me long for more than that book. After You, the sequel, is great too. I otherwise try to read the books they have for free on Kindle. There’s some hidden gems in there, some not so much. You just never know until you try! What about you? u/variableidentifier 
4	I’m 22 years old and I’m graduating college this year. I have mixed feelings about graduating on one hand I’m glad to graduate college but on the other hand I’m going to miss all the fun times and friends I made in college. For fun, I mainly play video games and smoke weed haha. Oh my major is Accounting. 
3	Yea hi everyone. This week i came back after two month of uninterest to MBTI subs. I love how this sub became more active, I love thread like this. Please make it regularly, admins!\n\n(still confuse on typing myself but yea i don't really care about it now.)
58	Trying to Find ISFJ Memes be like	
16	they always seem to be about baking cookies for everyone lol
9	Ask the INTP subreddit to make you guys some
7	Despite being one of the most common mbti personality, our brotheren don't give a shit about MBTI.
37	Gotta love ISFJ doms	
6	Ok, this is pretty funny!
5	whoa is this a thing? i'm an isfj and a pretty major sub. but the times i have been a bit more dominant it has felt good but i've not followed down that path at all... maybe i should
4	It's true tho lol
4	Dominating the oven.
3	Participate in my MBTI Survey	[Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WMhQAkegNdJ-A3xJcFrW-nFWrr7GmA0hZas0JV9VNgo/edit#response=ACYDBNhQ0PU1TZRvnGkP7PGc90QBwl3lFCfIB3vZtgcv085JbaqmtEYnxBTSVuifSUBK2rE)
3	If I were a smart person and I am I wouldn’t click that.
1	How to fix Fe and Ti Loop?	I am just fellow Isfj that consider my failure in those functions department. I cannot open up to people and try to cope with that with Ti function. It was once proven by psychologist I visited to solve other issue. I don't know what to do actually. Any advices?
2	I discussed this issue in this thread and it includes tips for getting out of the Ti loop. \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/aj4k2s/the\_siti\_loop\_what\_it\_is\_and\_how\_to\_get\_out\_of\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/aj4k2s/the_siti_loop_what_it_is_and_how_to_get_out_of_it/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wish you luck trying to break this loop! I know it can be hard but it will be really rewarding and worthwhile in the end. 
7	Opinions on Conservatism/Right-Wing Politics	I've seen a hypothesis that SJs, more than any other type, is prone to take conservative/right-wing views in various degrees of intensity more than any other political world view, and I want to test it out in the real world of ISFJs (i.e. all of you). What do all of you think about  the usefulness/validity/desirability of any of the varieties of conservative thought out there? 
1	So I'm pretty sure I just realized we don't have a set of rules in this sub, but just in case, I think it goes without saying that any attacking of others for their political views, or similar behaviour, will not be tolerated.\n\nI don't expect problems in a sub full of ISFJs, but you never know who's lurking!
16	Personally I'm very left wing. I don't believe that conservatism and other such right wing values tend to be in the best interest of a lot of people, although I certainly do see where they would have their applications.
6	23 F, definitely more conservative than my friends. I’d say mod-right on a lot of social aspects (except LGBTQ bc I’m not an angry old person). Also very fiscally conservative when it comes to economics, taxation, and things of that nature. My fields of study are Econ and politics, so my bias has not be influenced by my upbringing. I was raised in a modest, apolitical household. I find myself more inclined to support conservative views bc they just appeal to my own moral code I have created thus far. Can’t explain it. Since I was a kid I have always found myself appalled at some things people do in public or perhaps how liberal they can be about their bodies. I tend to be “sexy” but still conservative, if that makes sense. I’m very self-aware of those watching, so perhaps that’s why
5	My parents are very conservative and I didn't really question their views as a child.  I became moderate as a teen, then liberal as an adult.  While I might be considered conservative in my personal choices (traditional gender role, would not want an abortion, respects the law, don't drink/use drugs, religious), I don't feel like others have to make the same choices to be good or moral people.  Also the "caring for others" aspect of ISFJs is another big reason liberalism appeals to me.  
5	I tend to think of myself as fairly conservative, though where I live is so ragingly right-wing most people would consider me a liberal. I think the conservative ideals of fiscal responsibility, smaller government, and personal liberty are spot-on. I left the Republican party several years ago as I don't think it represents those values any more. Personally, I think the majority of the right has pretty much jumped the shark at this point. I love the leftist values of compassion and community, I just tend to think those things are better left to the people than to the government.
3	24F, I consider myself very liberal and progressive. 
3	I'm liberal. I think something like this could be more influenced by how you grew up than what type you are. However, as you get older if you are interested in politics you can like look into politics more and decide for yourself what side fits more with your beliefs or worldview. 
3	Honestly, I know that there's this whole stereotype of SJ's being the conservative ones, but I genuinely think a person's political views are influenced partly by what they grew up around, and partly by what they of course personally believe. Most of my fellow xSFJ friends are liberals, but I'm sure I could find just as many who are conservatives.  Haven't interacted with enough xSTJ's to really say anything about them. I have Fi-using friends who have more conservative views simply because they have conservative parents - half my ISFP friends are "rebellious liberals," and the other half have picked up the views of their parents without truly realizing it.  I do disagree with my INFJ mother sometimes on politics, but that has more to do with me feeling like she brings her theories into the conversation of politics - in general, both of my parents lean toward the liberal side, and I'm absolutely liberal. 
3	I tend to lean more to the right.
3	I was always socially liberal but I became fiscally conservative in high school and even more so in college. It had to do with learning about economics mostly. My parents are conservative but they didn't teach me their views until after I had already formed my own.  Learning sociology is what shifted me to full on liberal.\n\nThough there is a emotional struggle I dealt with regarding my left and right leaning beliefs. I remember a while back there was an infographic comparing left and right beliefs. A section of it was about parenting styles. \n\nIt showed the left wanted self nurturing kids who are open, empathetic, and examines themselves. And parents on the right were shown to want self reliant, disciplined kids with strong morals. It's generalizing but it still hit me. \n\nLet me find it: https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/left-vs-right-us/\n\nAnyways, so I realized I had started life learning all the parts on the right part of the family structure. I had strict, hard working parents,  who weren't nurturing but pushed me to achieve. But I had to teach myself all the stuff on the left side family structure to build friendships and toward my goals for how I want to parent. Which is a combination of self reliance and also self nurturing. \n\nAnd I've found that what I learned is that my ethics, my politics, and my philosophy is all emotionally driven. I wasn't completely convinced by the studies and statistics alone. It's all about how I view myself and my choices in the world and how I feel about the world that allows the studies and statistics to sink in.
2	I'm a libertarian.
2	left wing
12	I want to connect with fellow people/fellow ISFJs! Anyone feel similarly?	Not really sure where this post is going, but I'm sick of joining mbti discord servers advertised in here and finding theyre all full of INTPs... No offence but they're usually a bit weird imo. And I mean, my boyfriend is intp and hes weird but in a lovable way. But it's just not what i was hoping for.\n\nSometimes i try and trawl /r/makenewfriendshere or /r/needafriend. I want to help people out but usually i get frustrated because i feel like i can't (usually because they need professional help). But i just feel a bit lonely and want to talk to more people sometimes :(\n\nif anyone has any suggestions, let me know please :) <3
6	I always found the best way to make friends is to join a group with similar interests. If one likes singing, join a choir. Like photography, join a photography club. Like reading, join a book club. Like nature, join a walking / hiking group. Like gardening, join a "grow your own food"- club.. 
2	This is not really a suggestion as I have not tried it myself..but I have seen the school of life has made an app to help people make friends and it seemed to be aimed at us, introverts. Give it a try if you want :) \n\nAlso, I understand the frustration of wanting to help people and not being able to. As I found that it is hard to get people to say whats wrong when you can feel they are in distress. 
2	Meetup.com (also sorry)
22	Were you a socially awkward child?	I was a very shy and reserved kid, and was often bullied for various reasons, my Tourette syndrome and general social ineptness being one. Nowadays I am waaaay better at socializing and can more easily fit into a group (although some groups are too complicated and sometimes I just prefer not to).\n\nI was known as being very quiet as a kid, to the point where people were shocked if I spoke. 😅 Also, I offended more than a few people by not wanting hugs and such! These days I just take a deep breath and suck it up.\n\nI'm wondering if maybe some of these situations were due to underdeveloped Fe, as I've heard that doesn't really develop until early adulthood. Alternatively, it could have been that I was unhealthy (had severe untreated anxiety up until a few years ago when I finally acknowledged it as a problem), so I was in a Si-Ti loop, grip of Ne or whatever.\n\nThoughts? Similar experiences? I'd love to hear 'em!
21	Yes... and a socially awkward adult.
9	yeah, at school i were very quiet, and i only had two friends, but they were younger than me and not in the same grade as me. Even just a few years ago there was a guy in my class who thought i was mute.\ni was very quiet, and I still am. \n\nI feel like I have gotten more comfortable with myself, but I also feel like its intimidating that I'm so quiet?
6	Seconding being both a socially awkward child and adult.\n\nHelps it was harder for me to find people who had the same nerdy interests as me untli I got older which I think didnt help my awkwardness.
5	I actually have vivid memories of being really outgoing and funny as a kid, but come to think of it, that was always amongst a fairly large friendgroup where I trusted everyone enough. Outside of that, as well as around figures of authority I would have no idea how to act or what to say.
5	Absolutely. I was very quiet and shy as a kid. My favorite activity was being alone in my room reading books. I hated talking to strangers. I’ve gotten a lot better as an adult when I realized I don’t mind sharing personal details with people I trust. People think of me as outgoing even though I’m an introvert. I just like to see different friends and bring people together, even though a lot of social activity does wear on me. I feel that social anxiety creep in when I’m by myself in a crowd of strangers, or just worn out after a long day, or when I have to speak in front of an audience. But I’m not sure if it shows.
3	I am INFP and I had very similar experiences pertaining to social anxiety in childhood. I used to be awkward in most social situations. \nI assume the kind of environment we are brought up in has a big part to play in our social attitude, especially as kids. I grew up mostly around people who I consider aren't nearly compatible by personality type to me, and it took me a very long time to realise that, there were more people, who were more concurrent with my interests. This I now figure took a big toll on my social abilities and outlook.\n
3	Yes. And I was more comfortable around adults than other children (because they were more predictable). But luckily I had one really close friend throughout my childhood. And then at high school I got less shy, and more friends. 
3	Yes, though nowadays i try not to label myself as such. Im still in high school and I feel not even trying to consider myself that makes me more confident. I only have 2 close friends in school, and I guess a few other less close ones. (Though I'd consider them more like nice acquaintances) 
3	Shy and kinda quiet but still friendly, outgoing, cheerful. I was a happy smiley child..
3	For sure! My parents got the concerned "does she talk at home?" from teachers all the time during parent-teacher conferences.
2	Oh, absolutely.  I secretly craved social interaction so, so much, but I felt like other people would find me boring and so in school settings I kept to myself and did my work (which apparently led to some people thinking I was stuck-up in middle school.) When my mom took me to the park, I'd barely talk to the other kids - I didn't really know how to relate, even though I wanted to.  I'm sure having two introverted parents and an introverted sibling didn't help my case.
1	Yup. Still am as an adult, but I’m leagues better from where I used to be 
1	Yes, I was very awkward. Kind, but completely clueless about what should or shouldn't be said or done in situations. I probably annoyed a lot of kids. My behavior started to become more normal around when I was 14-ish.\n\nNow, as a young adult, I probably seem like your average Jo, but people who know me more personally say I've got some Asperger-like traits. I don't think I have enough to get a diagnosis, though. 
1	Yup I was for sure. I had autism so that made things like making and maintaining friends hard for me. As a result, my Fe was pretty underdeveloped and I had stronger Ti. I was definitely super shy as a kid and looked forward to school being over. I had to even attend a program to learn proper social skills. People were also shocked if I spoke too. 
8	What car do you drive and/or what kind of car would you want to drive?	Just wondering. Personally I drive a 2011 Subaru Impreza. I love Subies; my parents have had them for years. My first car was a stick shift 2001 Forester, then an automatic 2005 Impreza, and my car now is a stick shift. To me they strike a good balance between fun and practical. What about you?
8	Honda Fit for me. Hondas never gave us mechanical issues when I lived with my parents and the hatchback design means I can transport decently sized cargo conveniently. Gas mileage and high safety ratings are both great, too.\n\nMy ISFJ SO drives an SUV because she's tiny and likes feeling big, lol. 
5	I currently have a 2003 Toyota Camry. I know it’s old but I’m a broke college student lol. My dream car would be to have a Toyota Prius. 
3	2016 Chrysler 200. If I ever won the lottery I'd buy the new tesla roadster
2	I drive an '02 civic and once it dies I plan on having a Subaru Crosstrek!
2	'06 Corolla.  It's still chugging along fine and I'm in school right now, so I probably won't be getting a new car for a few more years.  I don't really care about what my car looks like, I'd just like more inside comforts since what I have is very basic.  Also car tech has changed a lot and I want that bluetooth and backup camera.  Thinking of maybe a Honda next? (I'm so wild and adventurous!  Honestly, reliability is most important to me.)
2	I have a ford fiesta in bright blue :D I'm not too picky with cars as long as they're clean and run well. I do prefer smaller cars like the one I currently have, though. Easier to park & less stress when changing lanes.
2	I went with practical over appeal. ‘08 Suzuki SX4 JLX. Nothing beats 8 months of winter like a front wheel, all wheel drive, manual transmission on all weather treads. I like to disengage the electronic stabilizer to drift with the wheels locked in AWD. 
2	Have a 2012 Honda Insight. It was originally my brothers but he liked my 2007 Scion TC more. I do like the perks of paying less for gas and much less often.\n\nI don't really have a dream car, I just want something red and has good milage and 4 doors that's not too big.
2	First car was a 2006 Chevy equinox in red, not my favorite had lots of issues and spent lots of money on repairs but it worked for college travel back and forth 2.5 hours! Now 3 years later I have a 2015 Ford Escape🖤 I needed something reliable for my 40 minute work commute. It’s black and if you look closely it’s almost glittery, has heated seats and came with a remote starter, I couldn’t be happier!
2	VW Jetta, but I want an old jeep Cherokee.
2	2009 VW convertible Beetle. Metallic pastel blue with black top. I would love to upgrade to a newer model in the future.
2	2008 bmw 128i. Huge european car fan. A car id love to drive though would be an Ariel Atom or an Exocet. I love the feeling of going around tight twisty turns fast lol
9	How do I (M,30, INFJ-INTJ) support a depressed ISFJ (F,25)?	I have an ISFJ acquaintance/ friend. While this has the potential for a long-term friendship, we don't know each other that well. We just meet one-on-one every 6-8 weeks for a semi-professional goal, and that's it. However, over the past 6 months that I've known her, I've seen her gradually lose interest in her life and hobbies and goals. I feel she is depressed and I want to be supportive. At the same time, I'm not sure if I want anything apart from a platonic friendship with her. Any clues on how I can be supportive, without crossing any boundaries? I care deeply for her, and if she is really going through something, then I want to be there for her. \n\nISFJs, when you are in pain, how do you like to be supported? 
9	You sound like a nice person to know, but as an ISFJ (a fair bit older than your friend) if I were 'confronted' as it were, I would retreat further and probably start to avoid you. Do you know if anything notable has happened in her life that she's mentioned in passing perhaps? Or you feel could be a trigger for the change? Sometimes I find talking through an 'issue' with a fresh - non nagging - perspective really helps, especially if I feel that person is genuinely concerned about me.    \n\nHow often do you chat/text in-between your meet-ups? Sometimes when it's written, rather than in a phone call, we have a little longer to prepare a response and give away as much as we need to (or not! I'm quite private unless I want to share) Maybe a "You've not seemed yourself recently, are you doing ok?"  message. It seems bland, but is kind enough to show concern, but certainly not overstepping the mark. \n\nJust my thoughts, I hope you can find a good balance to help your chum. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR - don't push or we retreat!  All the best. 
7	23/ISFJ/F: You’re really sweet to care. As an ISFJ, most of my healing comes from just being left alone. If I’m ever confronted, like the comments above, I’m more likely to avoid it and then avoid the person wondering, or just fib altogether and say “I’m fine”. The best way to handle this, I think, is just to let her know that you’re there if she wants to talk and let her work through that. ISFJ’s are “fixers”, so it’s hard to feel like we’re being “fixed”, despite the good intentions behind the question. Just keep being kind to her! She’ll work through it. 
7	first of all, this is very very thoughtful and sweet of you.\n\nwell, if I would feel depressed, I would like people to actually ask me how I'm doing (because most people don't do that) with a real interest, and seriousness in their eyes. \nIf I then would open up to them, telling them what's bothering me and so on, I would like them to comfort me, but also come up with real good advice - especially if the advice is based on concrete examples from past experiences, but also with a touch of ... poetry. with a touch of abstractness to it.\n\nto be honest,  just the feeling of opening up and venting to others are more than enough,  just feeling seen by someone!\n\nI wish you good luck!
2	Just say something like “I’m concerned that you are depressed I want you to know I’m here to help you get through this tough time”. Also Knowing that my friends and family are there to support me but also not forcing me to open up before I’m ready. Just knowing that the people in my life care about me so much makes me more likely to open up. I wish you good luck.
15	Random ISFJ ways you like to organize things	Some things for me\n\n* I keep a queue of order what games/shows/anime to watch, a mixed order of preference and when it came out (I'll also include release/starting airing dates of games/shows)\n* Every month or 2 I peruse my social media follow list to unfollow people that either dont post anymore or I dont want to follow to make sure my timeline is relevant and not cluttered. Especially since I'll randomly follow people I feel like I should\n* I started keeping an inventory of food so I motivate myself to eat out less. \n\nI use a lot of list organization in Todoist and Trello
7	I keep a text file with various lists of what I want to do (things to read, watch, play or learn) but only rarely I follow through them and instead I usually just waste time browsing other stuff. How do you guys do it?
3	I keep a pretty intricate log of my life in a journal. Everyday is broken into ten lines, with a line representing a block of time.  Two pages is an account of my week, and then every month, quarter and year I will jot out the highlights and try to reflect on the period a little.\n\n...It keeps me mentally compartmentalized. I understand where I've been, how I spent last week, or yesterday without forgetting. And a measure of accountability to myself so I am not frittering away time. It's a way of keeping my life organized in the most broadest sense I guess. 
3	Reading how other ISTPs organize themselves makes me feel a lot better about my countless Notes in my phone and lists I keep
2	I do #2 and #3! Costco really helps cut costs.
2	 I do #2! I also keep a checklist in my head of what I should do. I try to keep it down, but it's hard. But other than that? i just am by nature
1	Definitely 1 and 2 here. 
1	I have questions. You keep 2 to do list apps? No paper lists, but 2 apps? \n\n(hides my sloppy paper lists. *they are the best I can do*)
1	I have a spreadsheet that lists all my fixed monthly expenses, the amount, the day they are due, and the way they are paid.\n\nI also have a planner where I keep track of my migraines, where I keep track of what I eat (I sometimes forget), and keep various reminders. I mainly only open it to write down my food, though.\n\nI also use a lot of Google Keep notes in my phone to keep track of stuff.
1	Not random but I keep track of bullet notes in my phone app. For example, things to do, things to save up for. Since I usually like things tidy and organised, I see myself doing that random. For example, when I know I have the time to do it and once I decide to clean this, I'll start organizing this and that until I'm satisfied with the results.
1	-i go on unfollowing sprees\n-religiously started following phone calendar for class schedule\n-have a note on app of food bucket list, songs to download, dramas/movies to watch\n-i also have a whiteboard to do list i try to update each day
2	Song Recommendations?	I’ve been really bored with my music lately & I’ve been craving new music 😩\n\nYou know the drill 😜\n\n
5	I have some albums for you to explore with my fav songs !! \n\nSza- Ctrl: normal girl, love galore, drew Barrymore, broken clocks \n\nCardi B- invasion of privacy: be careful, I do, bartier cardi \n\nAriana grande- sweetener: R.E.M., goodnight n go, breathin, Pete Davidson \n
3	I've been obsessed with Post Malone's "Sunflower" lately... Also the new albums by Weezer and Papa Roach. So different from what I usually listen to, but ahh I'm enjoying them so much!
2	What genre of music are you into?
2	I'd be happy if someone can find some Chillstep to their taste. [Electus - Metaphysics] (https://youtu.be/5wPHJzdEnAA)
2	Any trance, EDM, old rock and pop songs. When you feel really REALLY shit listen to some jazz.
2	If you like Rap, Noname is awesome! Her flow is off the charts. 
1	Don't listen to radio... 
1	what kinda music do you like? :)
1	Room25!
28	Are you stubborn or can be in many situations?	Generally Im a passive/go with the flow kind of person\n\nBut if theres a task I really want to do, even if its something small I'll do whatever it takes to do it\n\n
11	yes, if i start something i have to finish it no matter what. i sometimes get ocd when minor inconveniences come up when i had a plan already
5	Usually, unless i get bored. 
4	Outwardly I often go with the flow, but on the inside there's a granite wall of determination. I tell myself I will accomplish no matter what. \n\nSometimes this is a bad thing, because I will chase after a lost cause of a goal long after I should have just cut ties and let it go. But there is something satisfying in achieving what looks impossible... so sometimes it ends up worth it.
3	I’m exactly the same way. Didn’t know this was an ISFJ thing. 
1	YEAH. hell yes.
1	Same, I'm very go with the flow kind of person, except that I am immovable when it comes to some of those very very few things I believe in :-)
2	I need help with typing!	Hi! Sorry to be a pain yet I really need help typing! I thought I was a INFP type 6 (I’m sure on the enneagram) and always just about type as one (like N/S and J/P is equal) yet after taking a functions test I got ISFJ.  I think I’m almost in between the two! I don’t know which I am!\n\nI think I use Si a lot (likely too much!) I always have flashbacks and little things can remind me of a certain day or time. I’m never in the moment and always thinking of the bad things that have happened in the past. I also notice the really little details, yet a car could almost run me over and I wouldn’t have a clue!\n\nI heard one of the differences between INFP’s and ISFJ’s is that INFP’s tend to think about their goals and fantasies while INFJ’s tend to carry them out, yet I don’t think I really do either. I never have any energy!\n\nI think maybe the enneagram type 6 sums me up better than a mbti type? I can’t really put into words what I’m like yet type 6 is pretty spot on!\n\nI overthink and panic a lot! Like all day long (maybe that’s my anxiety though!)\n\nI’m also very curious. I always like to know what’s happening and why it happened. Although this doesn’t always help as I tend to remember the bad things and replay them in my mind (like after watching a sewol documentary I stayed up till 3am crying my eyes out as I was so frightened remembering all the horrible things)\n\nI’m shy, cautious, innocent, curious, sweet, kind, bubbly, quirky and nervous.\n\nI tried my best to explain yet I probably didn’t do a great job, yet any help would be kindly appreciated! Ty! 💓
2	Since you have a desire to find your true personality type, I heard it helps to read the cognitive functions. Try reading the difference between those two types. \n\n"What stands out to you the most?" Is what I heard from others since I also wanted to figure out mine myself.\n\nISFJs have Si-Fe-Ti-Ne\nINFPs have Fi, Ne, Si, Te\n\nYou can search for cognitive function descriptions. Understand them and read other people's experiences from them, it can help. \n\nI think we only know ourselves better so I don't trust many people's opinion on me, they don't know me. And everyones different obviously, descriptions don't describe us exactly. I think cognitive functions are more understandable to know how and why we act, and helpful especially in personality typing. \n
3	Keyboards are a good start. You can get them as cheap as $10 these days.
9	How do you act once you're comfortable with someone?	I met an ISFJ at the start of last year, he was reserved, but friendly at the same time. He talked when I asked him questions (I talk a lot), but for the rest of the time he was comfortable just focusing on his work. I got used to him being around, but not saying much.\n\nThen he actually started making jokes and being openly (bluntly) honest, I was so confused, like what just happened? He's shared information that I'd deem personal-when he mentioned it, I was shocked-like sh\*t, what do I say? I wasn't prepared for this!\n\nIs this how you act once you're comfortable with someone? Or, is this how ISFJs normally act, but around people they don't know, ISFJs seem more reserved? 
11	Once I'd trust you I become more talkative and goofy around you. 
10	That seems rather congruent with how I act. I'm reserved at first, then get very open once I trust someone.
12	Congratulations! You've crossed the barrier of trust with a commonly self protective type. If this makes you uncomfortable I'd recommend being clear about it. I'd much rather have the opportunity to slide back into my shell than to realize some time later someone wasn't ready to meet the real me.
3	That is 100% exactly what I do. I see no point in “small talk”. There’s no substance or direction to it. I’m either all-in or quiet & focused.

5	Hello 1684th mbti server.
8	Can't STOP talking?	Okay. I was going to try to write this post without being longwinded but I can already tell it's going to be a page stretcher, so there'll probably be a TL;DR at the bottom if you want it, but I'm going to explain a lot of context things for my specific situation in between. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I'm an ISFJ through and through. I'm also a type 6w7, if it matters at all, and on top of it I have moderate anxiety which is where I get my habit of 'anxiety talking'. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've found that in the workplace and in social situations where I'm not surrounded by people I'm very familiar with, or care to get close to, I don't speak unless I'm explicitly spoken to OR if I need to ask a question, otherwise I'm content to just sit and watch conversations play out around me. But when I'm with friends, this is 100% the opposite. I've found that I have a bad habit of going on forever about something, even (a lot of times) rambling/circling the same thing over and over again/taking forever to get to the point. This might be anxiety, but I'm starting to wonder if it's something in my personality? When I notice myself dominating the conversation like this I don't FEEL anxious, I actually feel excited in the moment, until the realization hits that I've talked for way too long and everyone else has things they want to say, then I feel guilty, and then when I try to stay quiet and let them talk, I find another point I want to chime in on (this is usually during group discussions about what we think, so it's entirely valid to chime in on things, it's just the fact that I take up so much time talking it turns into a Ted Talk by Me on accident.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know I can be a good listener if I try, it's clear I can do it when I'm at work, so why can't I do it when I'm with people I'm comfortable with?? I know I'm able to speak more BECAUSE I'm more comfortable with them, but I don't know how to condense what I have to say down into a way that EVERYONE will understand AND have it be short. Also, when it comes to listening, it's not like I don't listen well at all, because when my friends DO talk, I DO listen, so it's not like I'm a bad listener so much as I'm a bad.. talker? Except instead of too little, I talk too much. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI only know 2 other ISFJS in real life, one is younger than me and one is a lot older than me and all 3 of us have anxiety, but I notice that the younger one is a lot quieter than me/is very patient with what they have to say, but the older one can go on tangents too, almost similar to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR, finally: Do any other ISFJs have an issue with talking TOO much in friend groups??
10	i end up doing this sometimes. i used to do this alot when i'm with a certain group of people but now i'm more aware and try to open up a conversation. \n\nalso noticed, this happens when i'm with a group that's more reserved/quiet than i am
6	I am also quite chatty and can't seem to shut up with people I am comfortable with or have decided to trust. I have confused many people because upon meeting me they think I am super quiet and then once I'm comfortable, bam the floodgates open! \n\nI constantly struggle with it. However three people have told me that they don't mind my chattiness because they don't have to worry about keeping the conversation going. \n\nI think as long as you do your best to make sure everyone gets heard, it's okay:-) 
4	I am too, with my family I sometimes get in a mood where I just BALABAJABALALALAABLABLABLA.. lmao\n\nbut I have gotten better at it.\n\ndon't feel guilty ok?
4	Honestly, I do have my moments with friends and family where I can't stop talking. But usually it has to be one of my favorite topics. My family says I'm super passionate about my favorite topics. Most of the time though I don't talk that much and I'm pretty chill for the most part. 
3	WOW, this whole post is me! I’m also an ISFJ 6w7. I can very much relate. I felt like I was basically reading about myself. :) 
3	I can relate. Mainly when it’s something that im really interested in like car. Youll never get me to shut up if i start talking about cars 😂
3	I can totally relate to this as well! With people I'm not comfortable with, it's a struggle to find my way around my thoughts and actually say something that would make sense. But with people I feel close to, my mouth never seems to stop and my listening skills takes a backseat. It feels a bit embarrassing but people actually appreciate this because they will get to know you more, compared to the super composed mask that we usually show the world. 
2	Oh my god I'm the same way! I'm a 6w5, so I tend towards being quite reserved at times, but once I get to know someone... I could talk forever. Haha.
1	Lol omg it gets worse in letters.
5	ISFJ in group works	Hey, I just have to write a paper on my group work and I wondered how fellows ISFJ are in group works.\n\nSo basically, we were 5 in my group and we have to write a 30 pages report for yesterday.\nThe natural division would be 6 pages for everybody.\nWe had like a month to do so after the end of our group work. And we already done the repartition of the work.\n\nI have started really early so that 10 days before the deadline, I had already finished the parts I was supposed to write.\n\nBut group works is what it is, some people didn’t do much or anything, so yesterday the report was 22 pages long and I had to completed/organized it to make it longer.\n\nI couldn’t bear that we don’t finished the report, so I felt obliged to do so even if it weren’t my parts.\n\nStill, I can’t be mad at them because I know that group works always end up like this.\n\nSo, how do others ISFJs handle group work ?\n\n
4	Incredibly relatable. I often find that I can only rely on myself. Try going to your professor maybe or track down another person in your group who has the same work ethic as you to approach the professor with you or just help you pick up the other members’ slack. It’s incredibly annoying and makes me dread group work but easier than the anxiety of ruining my grade because of someone else.  Not sure how to explain why we do aside from Si planning skills.
5	that is exactly how I do it. Start early, finish early. I do my part and sometimes people can't finish their part and so i make up the rest because it has to be done and someone has to step up and do it.\n\nin middle school I used to be more enthusiastic at the start of a group project. I would actively be part of the discussion on assigning roles and organizing work. I was so active that i'd pretty much take the lead. \n\nHigh school and college was different though. After a while, I realize that that enthusiasm is a tell that when things get hard, people know i'll put in that extra work. of course it's only a tell for those looking for it.\n\nso i stopped showing that enthusiasm at the start of a group project. i'll still do the needed work or extra work at the end when it needs to be done, most times for understandable reasons. it's just i'm cautious about getting grouped with a slacker that relies on someone else picking up their...slack. \n\nThere are a rare few people who treat doing work like a game of chicken. It's like they're holding a good grade hostage. It happens, and it sucks to be stuck with them. So i just don't make it feel so easy for them right off the bat. I keep my diligence and perfectionist tendencies a secret.
2	In groupworks, I want things done and accomplished so there has to be a leader. It's groupwork, we have to lead as a group. And that includes managing other people. I advise, really encourage others to step up on their work. If they need help or ideas then as a group, help them with ideas. Strive for that goal or a goal. When you see something wrong, fix it, I think you would know what's most important/right thing to do it that situation.\n\nBut if you're looking for how ISFJs do. I might be an ISFJ but heres my experience... I focus on my work before checking on others. When I know I am good on my work I check on others work. Since I may take too much time on myself then I have to consider my work is theirs and their work is mine, since its groupwork, credit is everyones.\n\nI first work my part, ask if it's right, look over it. Help the group with ideas along the way. Correct changes and see if the order makes sense. If some things don't make sense or are wrong, I want the group know the changes we should make and reasons for it. If they don't agree, then just I would bare with it. If we get things wrong its the group, including every individual. One opinion can help change someone's perspectives. I heard groupwork is also valued in the workplace. Imagine the times when you had a job and what would you do on this job, what you should have done. You are counted on the responsibilities and things you need to do on the job.\n\nMy work is everyones work and my work is theirs, in groupwork. Its hard to do someone elses work because we may not be taking the credit (might be better to kick them out. Lol.) But yeah, I'd just do my best and move to the next assignment. Better to finish than quitting.
10	Just curious, what careers are you fellow ISFJ’s in? How do you enjoy those careers?	I am at a point in my life where I am considering career options, and I wonder if those with this personality type are drawn to particular careers.
6	My ISFJ girlfriend is currently in the finance department of an assisted living facility but wants to move to managing the care aspect of the business.  She says she doesn't really want to be directly involved with caretaking of residents but instead sees herself in charge of the caretaking operations as a whole.  I think she believes that gerontology is her calling and she enjoys what she does!
6	My ISFJ wife is in social work and likes to work with young people on the autism spectrum. 
4	Computer Science major, but I do testing/QA instead of Programming.\n\n  \nProgramming is too stressful/difficult, QA I can use my detail oriented, organization, and decent speaking/people skills to better use while still being able to use computers that I love a lot.
2	Supposedly ISFJs are drawn to more traditional careers in academics, medicine, administration. I work in economic development, which is quite social and political. I wouldn't say I thrive in this field, but I enjoy it immensely.
2	There have been several of these asks in this sub. Have a look at them as well. \n\nUser Experience/Web Specialist for me. \nTrained in Lean Manufacturing practices that lends itself well to root cause analysis. Which I really love digging into and coming up with a solution and supporting data with it.
1	Any Marriage & Family Therapists ?
1	Healthcare for sure...I’m graduating soon to begin my clinical rotations for radiation therapy (perfect balance between physics and patient care for me)
1	Freelance translator here!\n\nI work from English to French, which is my native language, in the technical and legal fields.\n\nI get to work from home in an environment that I control (apart from the occasional keyboard-blocking cat), without worrying about social interactions and keeping my "social energy" for friends and family.\nIt involves a certain deal of perfectionism, but I don't get to get swollen by it too much because of the short deadlines. \nI enjoy being able to accept and reject orders depending on my capacity to handle work (mental health varying a lot sometimes). \nI'm specializing more and more in legal, so I regularly go to university or training sessions, which keeps the job interesting.\nThe texts that involve a bit of creativity are the most stimulating and also the ones that get me the positive client feedback. \n\nThe downsides are sedentarity, irregularity of orders (and therefore income), and little to no feedback from the clients, which means I don't get to know if my work was okay-good or okay-meh (but I'm always told when it's bad-bad).
1	I'm at a point in my life right now where I'm interested in almost everything (course, still in school, so haven't decided on a career!) I want to learn computer coding, I want to volunteer at the homeless shelter, I want to speak out for my community, I want to become involved in my city's politics, I want to write an analysis of a movie, I want to intern for anyone, I want to join the track team - I'm just willing to do almost anything safe and learnable.  I really, really, want to expand my knowledge this year.
29	Do you ever listen to music on repeat while you're stressed?	I find the best way to tolerate life stress is to listen to whatever song I'm currently into on repeat. Sometimes for a few hours at a time. Anyone else? I guess it's the fact that it's familiar so I know exactly what's coming.
8	Typically is a whole album on repeat. One that just hits how im feeling in that moment perfectly. 
7	Repeat on specific songs or albums. Then I tend to go down a rabbit hole finding similar songs with similar sound to build a small list for repeat.\n\nIn reference to memory threshold for us ISFJ’s:\nI use to get to the point I could call the next song on my 50 disc changer. Would fall asleep with it on shuffle and a timer. Only took a couple weeks and I had the whole thing catalogued in memory. Needed to switch the disc sequence to give myself relief of having to know the song coming up and that I didn’t like it.\n\nDo you find your favourite number within the range typically on a disc is usually your favourite song of the album?\n
3	Yes, so much so that I have permanently associated songs to stressful times in my life haha\n\nHide and Seek, Imogen Heap - unemployment 2018 \n\nCome Give Me Love, Tee Gardestaad - Unrequited crush 2017\n\nYuuri on Ice Free Skate - Thesis 2016\n\nAnd so on. \n
3	Yeah I love listening to enjoyable music from my past. I just love how listening to music makes me decompress from my day. 
8	Music definitely helps me to process my feelings and to de-stress. I never listen to the same song on repeat though, I’m afraid I would get sick of it!
3	Yes. And especially some good rock music. Love it 
3	Yeah. And depending on the level of stress, I’ll sometimes listen to the same Album on repeat for several days.\n\nMusic seriously affects my emotional state so if I’m stressed, I will listen to whatever helps reduce that stress and keep it on repeat. 
3	This os so me
3	Yep guilty of this too haha
3	Whenever I'm at a difficult time in my life, I go back to the songs that were popular when I was younger. It gives me a feeling of comfort of when times were better and easier.
1	not really
1	Not really. I'll find something to binge or maybe a comedy to laugh at. When i listen to music, i do use it to stress out sometimes, but really i use it to keep me calm. And i cant listen to a song on repeat for very long unless i really like something about it, which doesn't happen to often. I can only name like 10 songs i've ever sone it with. 
97	Us.	
16	\#FeProblems
7	Relatable
6	Every damn time. 😭
3	Happens to much.
3	Yep
2	one of my closest friends recognized this as a trait of mine and, on his journey to become a better person, has stopped asking for my help as much.
3	Infj wanting to celebrate Valentines with ISFJ.	I love buying presents, but I think he thinks I just keep buying him junk.  Should I ask him specifically what he wants or should I just plan an activity?
6	You can ask him what he wants and ask him what his honest opinion on the stuff you bought. You should also plan the activity
5	kjeezy0127 is right, ask for his opinion.\n\nThough for me, I don't like things. I like activities to do together. My girlfriend likes physical gifts but knows I don't. So we have to give to one another differently. \n\nhave you two discussed love languages? \n\nWords of affirmation, acts of service, receiving gifts, quality time, and physical touch.\n\nwe often want to show love how we recognize/like being loved. as a person that doesn't enjoy gifts, i don't think of giving gifts as that strong of an indication of affection. but people understand signs of affection differently depending on their upbringing. like some sort of language. a love language if you will.\n\nthere are tests online to figure this stuff out, but i don't trust tests or person bias when taking them. I just look at the list and think "what do i like? what do i respond to?" and ask my partner the same. and know to then adjust how we show affection so the other person can receive it better.
1	Thank you
1	Oh that’s funny! My sister is an infj and she loved giving gifts. Although I appreciate every single one, I am a huge minimalist. In fact, having too many things really stresses me out. However I almost always prefer practical gifts if it must be tangible. I agree with the few others here. Ask. Also as mentioned, experiences. Feed our Si with experiences we can look back on fondly. ;)
1	I bought a Groupon for an hour of shooting bows.  I am still dying to buy something else, maybe just his favorite candy.
1	Definitely ask him what he wants! Nothing warms my heart more than being asked + then receiving a present I actually want, as I have extremely specific preferences that you will never know unless you directly ask me. I'll show polite interest in all the gifts I receive but I often feel a bit sad. Then I immediately feel guilty for not loving what someone has picked out for me.
7	Changing food tastes.	My ISFJ wife would like to know if anyone else notices when they change a flavour even the slightest bit and if that irks you because you remember exactly what it should taste like.
4	Yes! Also oftentimes I'll remember a food from my childhood but when I try to make it, it just doesn't come out the same. The slightest difference is noticeable... So irritating.\n\nPossibly has something to do with the fact that I also don't enjoy trying new foods. I am, over time, expanding my palate, but I have to do it on my own terms.
3	Yes, I've always been able to differentiate small changes in the food I eat. Though I don't think it bothers me unless it's my favorite thing to order from somewhere.\n\nOften times I'm excited to see how something can taste differently and how that can possibly improve a dish or improve it upon trying to "fix" it. I also get kind of excited to see the many ways people can mess up a food. But I don't know why that excites me.\n\nThough i was very sad when my favorite chinese restaurant brought on a new chef on the down low and the sauces were tweaked slightly. It was still delicious, but not in the same way I loved. I had to mix in a touch of sweetness from another dish to get it closer to the taste I knew.
2	Yes. RIP Panera chicken noodle circa 2006. 
4	My life in the past year.	January last year I met my current girlfriend who I plan on proposing to toward the end of this year.\n\nIn June my father passed away. I had to take over his company and take on a huge work load to keep the company alive and ensure the survival of our income and the continued employment of my 20 employees. I moved in with my mom to look after her. \n\nMy sister and my brother in law (who pitched 4.5-5 hours of work a day 5 days a week after my dad died, who have helped with the company years ago but for the past few years have been getting paid to stay home while not actually doing any work) demanded 25% of the company along with the ability to work less and from home or they'll cut me and my mother out of their lives. They say that me and my mother are emotionally abusive to them and that in order to make up for that, and to show that we respect them and their boundaries, we have to give them 25% ownership of the company. Which I find doesn't make sense because that won't solve what they're saying it will solve. It sounds like they're being manipulative of me and my mother while we're grieving. Anyways, they made the ultimatum and when my mom decided that we can't please them, they cut us out. But they still live in a house that my mom owns and pays their utilities for, she also loaned them 60K for my brother in law to but his dad's condo in order to rent out for money on the side.\n\nI'm not allowed in that house anymore. It was where I lived together with my cousin and a close friend before my dad died. I left to live with my mom and they moved in. I've been taking care of my cousin for a year before then, and now have to text her and meet up with her to see if she's ok. My friend that lives there was kicked out of his prior home. He's going through a divorce and I've been helping him with his depression. Now he's there, depressed, and I know he relied on me a lot but I can't help him since i'm going through so much and also I'm not allowed over there anymore.\n\nI now live far from my friends and support and therapist, I no longer have the freedom or time to work out regularly, I had to quit my boxing classes, and I loss a lot of weight immediately after my dad died only to gain it all back plus some through stress eating. I've lost a lot of my strength and muscles I've spent so long trying to build.\n\nI've been able to reduce my work hours from the first month of 98 a week to about 50 a week. I'm juggling engineering work with sales and inventory management and purchasing and production management and IT. And i'm still trying to find ways to reducing it so I can get back to my healthier life style from before. It's getting there. Slowly. And I just have to hang on. And also get married because I'm in love. I think I just wanted to vent and maybe have a moment of self pity, shared the with other ISFJs.
2	((hugs)) I am so sorry for your loss and congratulations on your impending nuptials. \n\nWho legally owns the business? Was the 60K loan documented, did your mom make them sign for it etc? ISFJ's get taken advantage of due to their kind natures.\n\nI think you & your mom will have less stress in your lives if you cut your sister off, evict them from the house and rent it out for extra income, and demand payment installments for their loan. You both are enabling their poor behavior. They'll never learn humility & hard work if you and your mother baby them. Trust me, they will come around after awhile - they might cut you out of their lives for a few months but quickly come to realize that you guys are the only family that has their back❤️
14	recently discovered this subreddit	I wish this sub wasn’t dead, can people post memes and discuss their favourite food or books or something like that idk... 🤧
7	Hey! Myself and u/kjeezy0127 recently became moderators and we are working on reviving the sub!
2	Yes. Who is the mod? 
2	So... Is anybody excited for Star Wars episode 9?
2	Does it count if I'm not ISFJ
9	How do you experience your visions of your purposed future?	INxJs often will receive flashes from the subconscious especially when they zone out while taking in sensory data in the moment. What about you? I would suppose that for most ISFJs Ni (visions of the future/aha! moments) feels difficult to consciously use. For me it feels like infinite imagination, other times I will lay in bed awake not knowing why while someone I care for deeply would like help (coincidence?).
3	Okay I'm going to be honest. For me personally it's anxiety, stress, doubt, and fear.
1	I don't really have visions of my future. What I do have is confusion and anxiety about the future. I look at the classic landmarks of success/adulthood/rites of passage in our society and question if I am capable of achieving them, or even wanting them. When I think about the future I have this internal war between optimism and pessimism, where I think "is it even morally right to seek a relationship and bring a child into a world with so much suffering?" vs. "if I act like a recluse and refuse to participate it's not helping the world become any better...". I try to tell myself there's a middle path, but it's hard to find. Mostly when I think about the future, it's about how to simplify my life and pare it down to the most meaningful things, making goals and holding myself accountable. Sometimes I will daydream about a future where AI solves all our problems and humans don't have to work any more than they choose, so they are free to fill the future with anything that brings them joy instead of being driven by survival needs and status symbols.
3	What's your favourite movie, and why?	
3	I don't have a specific favourite movie right now, per se... But I've been loving the MCU! Oh, and most any action movie that's not too gory and has car chase scenes... I love those... Lol. I love CGI gimmicks, it's bad. I literally was obsessed with the tornado movie Into The Storm for years because it just fascinated me so.
3	I don't really keep track of favorites in general. Reason? There's so much to like! You can't pick just one. \n\nSome mentions I can think of though \n\n- Avengers: Infinity War\n\n \n- Doctor Strange\n\n\n- Jurassic Park \n\n\n- All the Harry Potter movies \n\n\n- Star Wars: Revenge of the sith (Order 66 is incredibly chilling) \n
2	Not much of a fan of having favorite movies. Is there a difference with having a "favourite"? (I joke)\n\nI'm not into sharing favorite movies, its personal to me. I do have one favorite but I won't share the title. I usually like horror genres or ones that get me thinking and figuring out things or seeing what a character will do. Finding a movie I can relate experiences to is nice. \n\nI'm mostly into animations. I do enjoy live action remakes of animations. Not my #1 favorite but its one of my favorites is Star Wars. I liked watching the fight scenes, who gets killed, who will win, what they'll do. But also just because I watched them years ago and like to stick to watching the rest of the series. \n\nOhh but with horror movies, gore scenes don't bother me, I want to see what really happens and also challenge how I can withstand watching scenes. Thrillers are exciting. But it really depends since it's just genres and don't always make great movies.
1	Hard to pick one, I have near to a hundred favorites.. :D
6	Discussion bait (😬)	What genre of books are y’all into, I generally gravitate towards thrillers or mystery/crime novels.
4	I love fantasy/mystery/thriller books.
3	Fantasy/horror 
3	Sci-fi/animal history. 
3	Young adult fiction (I'm 22 but I still love 'em), fantasy, a lot of sci-fi!\n\nI recently read Halfway Human by Carolyn Ives Gilman, and it was so good, I CANNOT stop thinking about it! Currently I'm reading The Authority, the last book of the series "The Culling" by Ramona Finn (a teen scifi series).
3	I love Fantasy, crime thrillers, Sci-Fi, and autobiography.
2	I’ve always liked reading history books and any kind of novel as long as it has a good story and characters. 
2	I like self-help books. 
2	Genre-wise i love sci fi and fantasy. \n\nPlot-wise I love stories where characters try really hard. I have a soft spot for stories about single parents or about a parent and child relationship. And I also find social/political maneuvering to be very interesting to read.
2	I used to be crazy over fantasy when I was younger. It's still interesting now but I'm mainly attracted to crime and mystery as well. A lot of the young adult fiction novels seem to be about these genres.
3	What country do you think an ISFJ would thrive in?	
6	Sweden, not for any real reason just because it seems peaceful there, and snowy.
6	norway
6	I live in Canada and I find myself thriving pretty well!

6	Anniversary ideas for ISFJ?	About to celebrate 2 year dating anniversary with an ISFJ. We are both looking forward to a quiet night at home after work, but any suggestions on how to make the night extra special? We've had a complicated relationship and I want her to know how much I love her and how she is my future.\n\nI'm an ESTJ if that matters.
5	Think about things she has done for you. People usually give gifts they like, and speak in their love languages the most. Anything thoughtful, that she had mentioned in the last. It the smallest gestures that mean so much. What makes her go Awwwwww and tear up? What does she say she wishes you did or did more of?! Also telling her 'she so your future' is beautiful! As an ISFJ I LOVE tradition. So my INTP boyfriend has been really good about traditions with me. Like I had never watched the Godfather. So he made it a big deal and we watched it and had Italian food. Another on of my favorite is going back to places (like one of our first couple of dates we went to a bar) so to celebrate we would get food from that place and watch something at home. Or even having a drink there and playing pool and then coming home. But my favorite tradition is on Valentine's day we watch horrible horror movies, and get (usually Mexican because it's out favorite) and celebrate with tiramisu. Or I love it when he wakes up before me and makes a simple pancake breakfast and comes home with coffee or tea. Really, thoughtful gestures go the furthest. Also, I love pictures?  
1	Massage her, i know i love me some massage from my man (He's a ESTJ as well) offer to cook her dinner and let her relax in the sofa! Take over her part as the caretaker and make her feel special by pampering her like that! Hope this helps :)
10	Weekend discussion thread: What are your goals and ambitions in life?	It's time for another weekend thread! This one is kind of late, which is my bad, but yeah.
8	My goal in life is to live a happy healthy life, hoping with someone else, and i hope to get a job as a meteorologist or some psychology major. Im not completely decided yet. 
4	Clearing my financial debt, other than that I don't have anything else.
4	 Solid thread My goal is to finish my accounting degree and become a CPA. I also wanna be a dad one day. I also wanna travel outside of America at least two more times in my life. 
4	I'd like to find passion for something, not just tolerating it, and also improve on opening up to others. Going to be a long journey until I achieve either one probably.
3	My career goal is to become a nurse, something within psychiatrics, I see myself happiest having a family & taking care of others. Also being debt free one day would be cool
1	That’s really cool! Good luck with it
16	How do you feel about pets?	Just wondering how other ISFJs feel about pets! So I know we tend to have a rep as caretakers, I think, and that sounds accurate to me because I tend to "mom" my friends sometimes... lol.\n\nBut what about animals? Like, for example, I don't have a partner and I'm too young to have kids, so when I moved out I kind of gravitated towards having pets. I have a cat (almost had a second, but she didn't get along with my first cat so i just fostered her for a while), as well as five aquariums. I also had a hamster, but I didn't like him very much so I gave him away to some friends (who then got a female hamster who bred with him and now they have a lot of babies xD). I got another hamster, but she was sick so she died. I was thinking of getting another, but I don't really have room in my small apartment for a cage at this time.\n\nI also tend to be kind of strict about taking care of pets properly, which is why I rehomed my hamster (I didn't like him so I knew I couldn't give him a good home), and also why I don't believe dogs should be kept in apartments, or that Bettas and goldfish should be kept in small tanks. I have a huge personal responsibility thing going on. Lol. Which also means I spend way too much money on the pets I *do* have. 😳\n\nWhat about you guys? And what are your favourite pets? Personally I'm not really a dog person because they are waaaay too high key for me, and have too much energy (medication makes me always tired), but cats and fish are perfect. I imagine a more active ISFJ would like to have a dog because you can do a lot with them.
16	To say I'm obsessed with my cats would be an understatement. \n\n\nI love animals in general, but cats are something else entirely. I've always loved them and I've never not had at least one. Right now my husband and I have two, but I've been pushing for a third, and once we move into a bigger place I'm seriously considering fostering kittens.\n\n\n\n I think they're the perfect pet for an introvert. They can be very sweet and affectionate, but they also keep to themselves a lot and aren't in your face all the time. Unless they're hungry. Hungry cats will straight up climb your face for attention.
12	I love animals. ALL animals.\nESPECIALLY CATS.
5	I've always had some kind of pet throughout my life. Fish, birds, turtles, frogs, hamsters, dogs, and cats. It all just depended on what my mom would permit me to have at the time. I love pets and find it strange to be without one. When I moved out I was petless for a few months(my cat needed to pass some requirements before entering the country). However lo and behold I found a stray kitten in the streets. I'm so grateful to have found the little brat and even happier that now she gets along with my cat. I wish I could have a dog too but believe it wouldn't be happy staying cooped up in an apartment. I'm waiting until I settle down and have kids if that ever happens. I enjoy keeping my pets happy and enjoy the comfort and company they provide. 
4	I don’t want children but I have a guinea pig, ball python, and dog. After owning these pets I’ve decided a snake is best for me. Low maintenance, there when you need it, and super adorable.
5	I love love love all animals. 
4	My cat is my world. I say goodbye to him every morning and look forward to seeing him when I get home from work, he chills with me when I watch TV, and he judges me constantly. He's a complete asshole but I'd do anything for him.
3	Animals are my passion! I am actually a veterinary technician (nurse) 😄
4	I don’t care for them at all. I don’t think I want children either. 
2	Cats are my absolute life, really can't live without one (well currently, 2). I had pet mice when I was younger and I loved making little mazes and houses and stuff for them and they spent most of their lives doing stuff with me as opposed to just being in the cage. I like dogs but many of them make me uneasy, especially untrained ones. I like spending time with my friends' dogs but could never own one myself. My piano teacher, for example, has the sweetest little sheltie and my mom and I always joke about stealing him, but he does bark a lot when I come to the door and I just can't find it in myself to tell the little guy to be quiet because that's his thing, you know? I'm also very low energy so I wouldn't be able to keep up with one as well. Unless of course I got a big old lazy dog, we'd be perfect together, but most dogs like that tend to smell and smell doesn't do well with my OCD. As for kids, I'm only 20 and everyone keeps telling me I'll change my mind, but I really can't picture my life with kids, let alone a long term partner (rOCD) so I'll probably just stick to cats and little critters. 
2	I like dogs better than cats. I think it’d be nice to get a dog once I’m out of school and living on my own. It would be awesome to take care of a dog. I think if ISFJs wanted to have a cat or dog, they would really enjoy it. 
2	I've always loved animals my entire life. When I was little (eight or nine), I was extremely fascinated with guinea pigs and rabbits. Eventually, my grandma got two bunnies. I did extensive research on taking care of them. I would make my parents drive an hour just to get 120 pound haybales for my bunnies. I also let them free roam both in my house and outside. They were litterbox trained and lived in my bathroom. I basically spent most of my time at home taking care or them and playing with them. I also convinced my parents to get me other pets such as turtles and fishes. My dad built me a pond in the backyard for my goldfishes. I also did a project where I transformed my tropical fish tank into an aquaponics (self-sustaining) system for a school project. Eventually I had to give away these pets because the fishes became too high maintenance (I returned them to Petco). Sadly, we had to give up our bunnies to the animal shelter because we got a dog (who I absolutely miss and adore today). He would get aggressive around them. So yup, I love all animals. Hopefully when I am done with college and move out, I can get a bunny and a bunny-friendly dog on my own.
2	I'm not big on pets. I love (certain) dogs, but I really can't stand cats.\n\nI don't currently have a pet. I'm not keen on animals in the house, honestly.
2	I love animals! I've had turtles, dogs, cats, saltwater aquarium, betas, a corn snake, hamster, a leopard gecko... the list could go on lol
2	I love dogs and cats and had dreams of owning bunnies!  (IXFJ here)
2	I think pets are incredibly cute but I don't want one, sadly. Too much mess and extra responsibility.

23	The Si-Ti loop. What it is and how to get out of it?	&#x200B;\n\nI'm sure many of you guys have heard of the ISFJ Si-Ti loop. So in every personality type the dominant and tertiary function are in the dominant attitude for the type. So for an extrovert the dominant and tertiary function are in an extroverted attitude and same for introverts with their dominant and tertiary function. Every personality can have a tendency to get into a dominant and tertiary function loop. Because we feel the most comfortable in our introverted world we can enter a dominant-tertiary loop with our Si and Ti. I wanted to write out this post to help people identify whether they are in an Si-Ti loop and provide some tips for how to get out of it. You guys can also comment with ways to get out of the loop.\n\n**Si-Ti loop in ISFJs**\n\nWe can get caught up in remembering past experiences and then instead of checking in with others via our Fe to get outiside perspective we can use Ti to overanalyze the past experience and get stuck in a rut. Our we can use it to become perfectionists and insist that every detail is done perfectly. In addition, we can use it as a strategy to emotional disconnect from others to avoid getting hurt. We could also use it as an excuse as to why we can't make friends or leave the house. This obviously in the long run leads to a critical spirit towards other people and feelings of loneliness and unhappiness. While it is good to get better at Ti, we shouldn't be using it more than Fe. Ti must be used in service of Fe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How to get out of a Si-Ti loop**\n\nThe first step is to try to get out of your head. The main thing that helps me is to remember the human element in decision making. It also helps to if you have someone you trust to talk about your feelings and emotions as this can allow your Fe to breath and relax a bit. Reach out to someone you haven't talked to in a while and see how they are doing. Think about ways you can help the people in your lives. Volunteering is also a good option. You can also try and meet new people remember each new people represents new potential positive possibilities. \n\n&#x200B;
7	I usually default to isolation and hiding in my head when I’m particularly depressed. However, I am a supervisor in the mental health field and am surrounded by friends who understand and can detect when people are detaching. Not only did they not allow me to isolate this last strong episode, I also myself decided that at any point, I could not be completely alone. I talked to people all the time or had some sort of noise going on to prevent myself from getting into my head. I processed how I felt, I used the phrase “cognitively I understand what you’re saying, but I still feel this way,” and I worked hard to take feedback appropriately, even though it was more difficult than normal. \n\nI’m on the upswing. I have had to work very hard for the past month and a half to continue functioning in work. I have forced myself into social situations with select trusted friends; I have broken down in some of these situations, but processed and moved on quickly. \n\nDon’t fall into this trap if you can catch yourself! I’ve done it in the past, and it hurts and takes much longer to get out. 
3	Interesting topic that I think Ive fallen into before, especially when Im too shy/lazy to do any social contact\n\nThanks for posting
5	How have you been experiencing Ni demon?	
4	I actually have no clue what "Ni Demon" is. 
17	r/ISFJ Demographics Survey: Jan. 2019 edition!	
7	Oohh nice idea, I approve!
5	I'm not sure what my enneagram is, so I just selected one of the options.\n\nJust a heads up since this will throw the data!
3	Hey everyone, [this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMc05zyQyEaOUYf21QRUpl6Hl_UIty88hYJ0eCIPr4ebi4pg/viewanalytics) should link straight to the results! :)
3	It doesn’t include “The Defender”
3	For age, you have \n"Under 18"\n19-24" and so on from there. \n\nYou should change "under 18" to "18 OR under" because i cannot select age 18 for this survey. 
1	`Do you have pets?`\n\nYes - 47\n\n`If not, want (a) pet(s)?`\n\nI have pets - 44\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHmm...
3	Trying to help out a isfj I need advice.	So I am an ESTJ and 26. I am significantly younger than my isfj friend. He’s 63. NO interest here, my friend or maybe not friend has a wife. This issue has been going on for a long time.\n\nI have this friend who has been diagnosed with diabetes. And he took the news with a really hard hit. I get that I think he’s unhealthy as an ISFJ and as a person. Anything little he doesn’t get his way with he’ll break down crying. If there is a situation that is a little more difficult he’ll have a melt down. He was so upset for two weeks after his diabetes diagnoses there was no consolation. I took out the weight calculator and we determined that he is over 80 pounds over weight use to be 100.\n\nThis time he was arguing with me over whether popcorn is junk food or not like a little kid. Yes no yes no yes no type of thing. I try to prove logically that it is. And he came up with popcorn from the store isn’t like theater popcorn. Popcorn is corn so it’s healthy. The biggest pile of crap I’ve ever heard. I became a little frustrated and he hung up on me. We were discussing his junk food habit. He’s 80 pounds over weight and he claims he’s cut out junk food but when I pointed out it’s a once a week thing he couldn’t take it. I stressed a healthy lifestyle. He got this my fitness pal type thing and he can see the breakdown on there. Sometimes he can see why he is over goals. I try to tell him there is something more simple than doing the diary just keep in mind of the portions and don’t eat unhealthily. And when he eats junk food he really goes for it. Two bags of fritos and a almond joy. One time he had 20 of some sweet cracker cookies. His weakness is food. And he over eats anyway. He tries to make excuses for eating a lot. “I like eating” “I am a man” and all sorts of other stuff.\n\nHow am I suppose to talk sense in to him? And how do I help him if he doesn’t want help?
2	Im pretty sure unbuttered popcorn is a pretty healthy snack... Compared to most other savoury snacks anyway. Have you compared the calories?\n\nHow does your friend feel about you helping him out? To me, it seems controlling. Maybe that's what he needs though, i dont know enough context.\n\nlike you said, you're only (maybe?) a friend. he has a wife that should be helping him. Maybe you need to take a step back or take things slower. Tracking calories on mfp is a good step and maybe he just needs some time to cut down on the unhealthy habits. Doing too much at once might seem too daunting/overwhelming for him. 
11	(Survey) Relationship Between Personality Type and Drug Use	
4	Coffee is considered recreational drug use? Geez.
4	I think the survey would have been improved if you had a question about how often you use the drug - like, I put down alcohol but I really only drink rarely. Maybe a few times a year now.
6	Your poll missed out on people who haven't done any drugs.\n\n  \n\n\nWe exist.

8	Weekend Discussion Thread: How was your week?	An idea that us new mods had was to start discussion threads within the subreddit. I decided that a weekend discussion thread would be a good way to start it off! So, because I am not very creative today, I'm just going to do a generic "how was your week" thing.\n\nSo... Chat away, folks! :P
5	My week was pretty good I just got back to college and I'm starting my final semester in school on Wednesday. I'm also volunteering in an MLK parade that I'm pretty excited about. 
5	This is such a lovely idea! Thank you for kicking this off =)\n\nMy week has been good, overall. Transitioning into a new role/career path at work, which has me nervous, because it’s something new (gasp, change!!), but excited to be more of a specialist, and to grow my skill set. \n\nI am facing some pretty tough depression, the likes of which I haven’t seen in years. Definitely have two parts of myself that are at odds - the rational adult who knows that recovery from depression takes equal parts compassion and work, and the juvenile part of me that just wants to fester and pout and not put any effort into feeling better. Depression can be like an annoying sibling sometimes - gotta live and grow with it, even when it really gets on my nerves. \n\nNonetheless, I am very glad to have some decent insight from previous bouts of depression, and to have patient, loving support from my partner and friends, so in a weird twist, this week also has me feeling incredibly fortunate and grateful. The people in my life are pretty fucking wonderful. 
3	Whew, it was a long week. For some reason I am still transitioning back into working after being off the week between Christmas and New Years.\n\nDoes anyone have any neat weekday night ideas? I am looking for some new things to do after work, outside of the normal trivia night etc.
3	My week started out pretty bad, stressing over tests and such, but ended up pretty nice. And the snow we were supposed to get here from lake effect (NW indiana here) only happened to be about maybe 2-4 inches. Instead like a foot. Also, Season 2 of The Punisher released yesterday. I've only watched the first two episodes but I'm enjoying it! 
5	I guess.. it was ok? I went skiing today. wonderful nature to go skiing in, here in Norway. \nwith my dad!\nI also read a lot in my book; the laws of human nature by Robert greene.\n\nthanks for asking ! 
5	Hello!\n\nMy week was pretty alright. Busy but now that's it's a 3 day weekend for my job for Martin Luther I get extra days to relax and study up on Japanese which I've been doing more consistently recently.
19	Does anyone else casually lie?	I’m an ISFJ and I haven’t seen any personality trait relating to this type that has to do with lying. I have some examples of how I lie, and I would like to know if this has anything to do with ISFJ types or if I’m just crazy. Please give some input. Here goes:\n- I lie practically everyday. \n- I sometimes lie to avoid talking about something. For instance, today I lied to my friends about having an interview for a new club I was going to join. My reasoning behind that was because I didn’t want them to think I’m trying hard in college to get involved in stuff. I also didn’t want to offend one of them, who was trying to join clubs with me but I didn’t tell her about this one because I applied over winter break. So I lied about that and just said I was dressing up to join a committee in a club I’m already in.\n- Another example is when I try to be oblivious to something, like my friend starts talking about something I already know and they just start explaining and I continue listening on and on.\nOther times, they would ask me if I had already seen something or know about something like a meme on FB and I would just say no just to keep the mood up and not disrupt the flow of their excitement. \n-Another way I lie isn’t explicit but for instance, I would see my friend wearing a sweater I clearly had and I knew where it was from. Then a few weeks later, I would ask them where they got it from. (Idk if this fits into what I’m trying to say)\n-Lastly I often get really nervous talking to important people (interviewers, etc.) that I start lying
11	Tbh, I often find myself lying by omission. I have a really good memory for what people say and oftentimes can remember all sorts of little obscure facts they've told me. Sometimes it creeps them out that I have remembered in that much detail so when they're telling me something I know they've told me before, I just nod and go along with it.
4	Same. 
6	Yes and it's almost always when I remember how they reacted to certain topics before that I lie, because I just don't want to go through that again.  
2	Yep. 
2	I agree with the third point.\nbut in general I try to not lie.\nabout big things? i don't lie.\nwhen it comes to small lies, I tend to think in my head; is it really worth lying about this? creating a habit? and I tell myself no. I try not to lie abour small things. 
1	Yes! I consistently lie about similar insignificant things. Daily. Didn’t realize it would be associated with our personality. Cool, I guess. 
0	Why don't you value the truth? \n\nI dated an isfj for a few months and they lied a lot. It wasn't sustainable but they thought they were doing the right thing. \n\nThe truth becomes evident eventually and leaves you guys (liars) on the back foot.
5	How do you (ISFJ’s) keep your life organized ?! HAAAALP	I’m 23 & don’t have my shit together.\n\nI’m in my last year of my undergrad & as I’m getting older I can’t keep track like I used to. It’s become very frustrating & clearly I need to try something new. \n\nI can never stick to a planner & honestly I just end up wasting my money. Recently, I tried an app on my laptop but again never kept up with it.\n\nI’m curious as to how y’all keep your life organized, so I’d appreciate the suggestions 🥰\n\nThank yoooou
9	I just... have thought in my head reminding me
7	At the beginning of each semester, I get a planner and write out all due dates and test dates in my planner to remember. I also put in big events during the semester. Do you have an iPhone you can put reminders in your iPhone to complete tasks? 
5	So I put appointment reminders and stuff in my phone so I don't forget. I also have a planner, but don't use it much. I also have a spreadsheet in Google Sheets that details when all my bills are due so that I can keep track of my money.
3	I use 4 different things. I say this in my interviews when employers ask about my strengths. I say my “organizational skill”. I use a physical calendar, google calendar on my phone and on my computer, notepad on my computer, and reminders on my iPhone. When something comes up I put it in my google calendar and it gives me notifications. Good luck!
2	Yes! I’ve tried the planner route before & I never kept up with it. \n\nI’ve thought about using my iPhone, but idk.
1	I'm an obsessive list maker and I HAVE to write down dates and stuff as soon as they crop up so they can go in my diary, otherwise I totally doublebook.\n\nI just sync everything across devices too - I've lost and broken too many phones to just rely on a lost saved in there that's not backed up.
13	Debunking the rarity of INFJ: Commonalities and differences between ISFJ and INFJ	
8	This is why I love ISFJs. My childhood best friend was an ISFJ. They make me feel so safe and loved.
5	I relate to more than half of the INFJ commonalities (very strongly to some of them, actually). I still think of myself as an ISFJ. The Si is too strong to be ignored.
4	Yeah I do like to sometimes questioning why things are they are and wanting a good explanation for the reasons. 
2	Now I’m split. Arghh. I will say I gravitate towards ISFJ however INFJ does ring true for some things I do. 
7	I've been asked to be the manager of my team. Looking for ISFJ management experiences/stories and advice.	My director pulled me into his office the other day and asked if I would take on the role of manager for the small team I'm in. I still haven't decided if I should accept. I have some concerns:\n\n* I am a female in my mid-20s, and would be managing two guys in their early 30s. This intimidates the heck out of me, and surprisingly more so because I consider them friends. Could I be taken seriously as a leader?\n* I feel that I may experience "impostor syndrome"-- despite working there for several years, I often feel I don't deserve the praise and confidence my higher ups have expressed toward me\n* Obviously as an ISFJ there are things that work against me in a leader role-- I'm not really assertive, I don't like ruffling feathers, I prefer to avoid the spotlight, I have trouble looking at the "big picture", I often take on too much work, etc. You know.\n\nI know there are things about ISFJs that can help us be good leaders, but it seems that there are a lot of hurdles. Anyone have advice or experience in regards to leadership as an ISFJ?\n\n
6	try to be assertive. don't let yourself down. stand up for your opinions while also listen to theirs. actively listen to theirs.
5	I’m 25 and have to be in charge of people in their 40s and 50s with tons more experience than me. I will use the fake it till I make it routine if I feel uncomfortable but it’s not a great long term approach. Try and get an assertive type friend who you can use as your voice or to be the “bad guy” if need be and so long as they are supportive of being in that role. That has really helped me focus on actually managing rather than fretting over what everyone will think of my decision. I wish you the best of luck!
3	Some thoughts:\n\nGoing from an individual contributor (IC) to manager is a career change. I didn’t really realize that when i moved from a team member to the manager of my team.  There will be new/different challenges as a manager and i spent more time dealing with interpersonal issues that i didnt have to deal with before. It was a growing opportunity for me as I’m not the best at handling interpersonal issues. \n\nWhen i became a manager, I was significantly younger than some of my team - a few around my age, but most were older than I (10, 20, 30 years older). I didn’t experience any issues with the age difference from the team.  But, it was hard for me to get use to telling the team to do something instead of asking them to do something. I had to work on how to say no and being less accommodating when it would adversely impact the team or our deliverables.\n\nI definitely experienced the “impostor syndrome” (and still do from time to time). But i’ve learned to take the praise/confidence my manager gives me to counter my internal struggle with “impostor syndrome”.  \n\nI tend to be quiet, avoid the spotlight, avoid conflict and those traits make some aspects of management harder. But i learned a lot and have grown because i had to do things outside of my comfort zone.\n\nOnly you can decide if the role is right for you. But if you dont try, you wont know if it’s right or not for you.  \n\nIt also takes some time to get comfortable with any new job and there is a learning curve to get up to speed. It took me over a year to feel comfortable when i started. \n\nIf you take the manager role, make sure that your company backfills your old position. When i started, that didnt happen and i ended trying to do my old role (because it was familiar/comfortable and i knew i could do it well) and my new job. I ended up working a lot in my first year and had to learn to let go of some of the work and delegate to the team.  \n\n\n\n\n\n
3	I'm an ISFJ and was promoted last year to manager. I was a bit scared but luckily the team are really nice. I've booked myself on to some internal management training to help strengthen my skills and fill in any gaps.\n\nThe thing I find the hardest are those awkward convo's where you know people are going to react badly, but I've found that by staying calm and factual I can usually pull through on them. I also hate presenting but can force myself to do it when I need to, and it gets easier every time.\n\nI've kind of just faked it til I've got more comfortable with doing things and if I'm ever really unsure about something I'll check in with our head of dept just to run through. Not very often and in a "x has happened, I was gonna do this to sort it. Is that ok?"\n\nYou will ace it!
2	Hey, I'm a bit late to the party. I'm currently a assistent manager at a local store. The only thing that has been a downside is the fact that, if people don't do it the right way/not the way I want them to do, I'll do it myself. Same thing as when they take too long to understand/I have to repeat myself a lot. I just get frustrated. I don't know if that is a ISFJ thing, but it's a thing to be thinking about of you have the same trait. Good luck! \n\nAlso, I'm also a female in mid 20's, and I have to manage people ranging from 20 y/o to 40 y/O's. :)
23	Please welcome /u/variableIdentifier and /u/kjeezy0127 as new moderators for /r/ISFJ!	As mentioned in the moderator signups topic I made a few weeks ago I was looking for people who look like they can do some fun interesting things with the subreddit and based on what they said I'm excited to have them!\n\nI personally choosing to step down as a moderator myself soon since I've been busy and haven't done as much with the subreddit as I want.
14	Hey everyone! :) Thanks for the welcomes and I'm super excited to be a mod!! 😊\n\nA little bit about me: I'm Canadian, I love cats, I'm in the EST time zone, and I work 7 AM to 3 PM, so I'll generally be around in the evenings (although I'm at work as I type this out! 😅). Also, I mostly browse on mobile and I love to use emojis.\n\nI have some ideas for discussion topics and making this subreddit more active. I've noticed that a lot of other MBTI type-specific subreddits have a lot more activity than we do. Maybe some weekly threads, or weekend threads could help with that here!\n\nI hope y'all bear with me while I learn how to be a mod. I've never done this before, and I don't exactly know what to expect!
11	Hey everybody. Thanks for the welcome and I'm stoked to be a mod. I'm really excited to make this subreddit more active. I have a few interesting topics that I want to implement such as ISFJ Handling Care Manual and a sub on the ISFJ Si-Ti loop. I live in California so I'm in the Pacific Time Zone. I'm new to be a mod, so bear with me. If you guys have anymore interesting ideas to add to this sub feel free to PM me. 
3	A reasonable choice! I hope these new moderators keep the sub civil and fair. Congrats on becoming mods for r/ISFJ u/kjeezy0127 and u/VariableIdentifier 
2	Welcome!
1	Looking forward to more interaction in this sub! 💕
1	i love the new GREEN theme!
10	How do ISFJs feel about ESTJs and ESTJ parents?	Do you guys get along OK with ESTJs and ESTJ parents? Or do you hate them? How do you feel about their insensitivity and cold hearts? 
9	My very best friend is a estj, we have always learned from each others differences, he draws out the more brutal logical no bullshit kind of attitude in me while i make him feel at ease to express his inner feelings and emotional side than he would ever dare share with others that are not as close to him. We are planning on getting married, he is my definiton of the feeling "home". I know he will be a strict but ever so loving parent when that happens for us, so i couldn't feel more secure about my selection in a partner, lover and a future coparent.
4	My older brother is an ESTJ. I think very highly of him for his intelligence and his ability to remember so many things pertaining to history, politics, ect. (Not sure if that is an ESTJ-specific trait, but it is definitely a major highlight of his personality.) I have had to get used to being told (very bluntly) when I'm wrong and exactly why I'm wrong, as he always holds strong but thoroughly thought out stances on things. He is also EXTREMELY self-disciplined and holds others up to a similar standard, which again I admire, but it can get a little too stringent at times. I would say he is the most reliable and emotionally stable figure in my life.
2	ISFJs often look up to and admire ESTJs, but there is also strain in the relationship based on ISFJs being sensitive to ESTJ's dominant Te function. In socionics this relationship is known as supervision, where the ISFJ is "supervisee" of the ESTJ, so spending a lot of time with ESTJ can lead to low self-esteem in the ISFJ: [**ISFJs and other MBTI types**](https://www.personalitycafe.com/isfj-articles/285-love-types-isfj-5.html#post4235430).       \n       \nI knew one ISFJ girl with an ESTJ mother, but their relationship wasn't any healthy. Her mother is over-protective of her and thinks that her daughter cannot do anything right on her own (typical "supervisor" reaction to their "supervisee") so her mother didn't want her to attend school and move out of the house to live on her own. She thought her daughter lacked in diligence and organization ("supervisor" seeing weak point of "supervisee" which is Te for ISFJ). Her ISFJ daughter responded by having emotional meltdowns and becoming very depressed and emotionally manipulative, since she didn't know how else to loosen her mother's grip on her.  It took the rest of the family and ISFJ's ISTP brother to explain to the ESTJ mom that she needs to loosen her control and encourage her daughter to become independent instead of sabotaging her attempts at growing up.
1	ISFJ\n\nMy Mom Was an estj and it Was pure hell growing Up with her. I know tho that she is very unhealthy and all ESTJ's dont act like that. But yeah.. lots of psycological abuse and Gaslighting.
1	My partners dad is an ESTJ & he intimidates TF out of me 😂\n\nWe’ve been dating for 3 years & I’m still scared of his dad hahaha
7	Giving an ISFJ emotional support without coddling?	I'm at ENTP and I fall very into the "helpful criticism is meant to help and people shouldn't take it so darn personally" category... which of course means I have no idea how to be encouraging to my ISFJ friend. My friend has a huge problem procrastinating and dislikes change to the point that she doesn't really work on her goals, health, etc without some cajoling. I feel like i need to use kinder words and be more patient with her, but I also feel like if I'm TOO soft/patient she'll just laze around the house all day and I know she has so much more potential than that. Advice?
7	Just be blunt. Don't be rude about it, but cut through the chase. Good luck.
3	Try telling her it's constructive criticism and that you care about her and want to see her become a better person. I'm not a huge fan of criticism either but I tend to take constructive criticism better. Also, if she is afraid of change then remind her of ways she has overcome situations like this in the past. Comparing and contrasting the situations can be comforting for us. 
2	Find a way to show her the practicalities around the change, and open her eyes to anything that isn’t potentially “scary” about the change. \n\nMy bf is entp, you guys da best!
1	there are certain family members that I also take out my helpful criticism to, believe it or not. \n"I'm saying it to help you!" I say.\n\nbut it actually doesn't help on them, so I better stop it.
8	Where do you guys live?	What do you like about where you live? Hate? \n\nI’m in Boulder and both like it but also feel like a complete outsider (there are so many N’s here!). I felt so much more home in FL- felt like more S types lived there who I could relate with and carry a conversation with more .... comfortably. I also miss it tons because my family and friends are there. Really I’d prefer to be where they are, as long as I got to travel the world and explore.\n\nAnyway, just curious. Also where would you LOVE to live and why?
4	I live in Tampa, FL. I'm not sure where else I would want to live 🤔 I would have to travel more to figure that out.
4	I live in Galicia, Spain. To me the slow pace of a quiet village in the countryside is what I mostly enjoy.
4	I live in Barcelona, Spain. Bad things: It's a busy city, but I like to use heapdhones when I'm in the street , so no big deal. But the amount of tourists is insane and sometimes is a bit ennerving to get stucked between crowds haha. Cost of living is a bit high when comparing with the average salary. And for good things...  I like that we have beach and mountain at the same time, but in a very cosmopolitan area. Also, it's quick to go from one side of the city to the other with public transport (max. 45minutes). We have overall good weather and mild winters, I love that! There is a lot of offer regarding leisure, restaurants, etc. So you are never bored. And I love mediterranian gastronomy! 
3	I live in the Dirty T aka Tucson, Arizona. I hate it here. I’ve lived here my whole life (23 years) & I’m ready to GTFO ! \n\nI guess the one thing I hate about Tucson is the people. 1. People don’t know how to FUCKING DRIVE HERE 2. Fun fact: people will drive after you if you piss them off in traffic 3. Soooo many CRACKHEADS !!!! 4. Crime rate (google that shit) 5. Getting pan handled in the grocery parking lot, ughhh\n\nMost definitely the construction tho ! There’s always construction but somehow the city still floods when it rains & is covered in pot holes.\n\nWhat I love ?\n\nThere’s nothing like an Arizona sunset.\n\nWe have saguaros ? Idk I guess people have never seen those before & are vastly fascinated by them haha\n\nThe nature (lmao I have yet to see the Grand Canyon, don’t come for me I KNOW OKAY).\n\nI am working on moving to Colorado (Fort Collins) to complete my Masters degree & am planning to live there permanently. It’s not too far away from AZ & CO is beautiful. I’m really craving something new & I have high hopes for CO. Other than that, Germany, the UK or the Netherlands.
2	Currently I live in Wyoming. Things I like about Wyoming is the isolation, friendly people, and not overpopulated. What I dislike is the Seasonal work for construction and heavy equipment. However I'll plan on moving away from Wyoming. Most likely South Dakota. 
2	I live In Miami Florida , looking to move to New Jersey ASAP, can’t stand it here . 
2	I live near Boulder too! I am from California but I really loved living in Portland. Was only there for 6 months but I really loved the city there.. so many different types of artistic people, and the drivers were so nice.. they would stop for you even when they had the right-of-way. 
2	I live a few minutes outside Oslo, in Norway. I like to live here!
1	I live in San Diego, CA. I love the weather out here and the fact that I’m so close to the beach. I also love that there are so many things to do out here. 
1	Northern Ontario, Canada... I'm from southern Ontario which is a lot more fast paced than here, but I don't like the fact that I'm several hours away from my family. But I have a good job with the government and cost of living is a lot more reasonable so when it comes down to practicalities, this is probably a good place for me to be...
1	Pennsylvania. Born, raised, and never want to leave. 
45	Anyone else have low stamina for shopping?	I like it up to a point, but I can often only do several stores before I get tired and want to sit down or leave. Anyone else?
21	Yes, I enjoy shopping but I do run out of stamina and want to go home.  The busier the shops are, the faster my tolerance decreases.  Thank goodness for online shopping for allowing me to skip the stores between Black Friday and Christmas.  Some of my coworkers were telling me how they went shopping for literally the whole day and I privately thought that sounded like being in actual hell.  
8	Hahaha currently sitting in my car browsing anything and everything to avoid going into store #3 for this exact reason😂🤦🏻‍♀️ coffee helps...but still...
7	Yess! I have a shopping list, get the stuff on the shopping list and then I leave. 
3	I'm in and out of a shop in fifteen minutes if I'm alone, there to purchase something specific and not in a shopping mood, but otherwise I don't mind shopping for 3+ hours. Yea my feet die by the end of it but at the right place with the right people, I don't notice too much.
5	Definitely an in and out shopper. Research ahead of time what I want and execute. I make the exception and gather energy when the ISFP gf wants to go "shopping" aka paint herself in Sephora...>.< the things you do for love....
3	I go to small footprint stores because large stores are exhausting. I'd rather pay a little more but get what I need and not be exhausted after.
3	Yea especially witb other people. I like shopping by myself but I especially love online shopping
3	Yes. I LOVE online shopping. And if I have to go to real shops I prefer going alone, and be able to get to the car and leave as soon as I don't feel like shopping anymore.. And prefer small shopping malls over huge ones.. And prefer shops where staff doesn't constantly ask me if I need help.. 
2	I tend to have an issue with getting anxiety attacks in big warehouse sized stores.
2	absolutely. i just lose my energy so fast if I go to several stores at once. one or two, perhaps three stores in one run is enough for me.
2	I have to be in a very specific mood because half the time it involves constant bumps, sorries, and trying to get around people or out of people's way. Salespeople always seem to get me, too. It's like I have a target on my forehead...
2	Yes. I absolutely hate it. Don't know what I want + can't find the perfect item + don't want to spend money on something that won't be used constantly =impossible situation
2	I only shop when I have to. Like if I’m down to my last pair of jeans and they finally rip. Otherwise I try to keep things stocked far in advance when I can so I can avoid shopping.
2	Me, I'm a go in store, get what I need, and gtfo. I also have driving anxiety so I will actively avoid shopping when it's busy. I prefer online shopping.
2	Yea I have this issue a lot especially when I am shopping with someone else I notice it a lot more. They are all excited about buying all these thing and being around all of these people. My main problem is I have very little money so I hate to go shopping because everything is just too much. 
11	Enjoyable Careers for ISFJ'S?	I was just wondering what type of jobs/careers you guys have experienced (or are experiencing) that you enjoy and think that works well with being an ISFJ. 
9	Nursing
10	I think user experience design is good for ISFJs. You use established methods to solve people's problems!\n\nEdit: Spelling
8	I work Human Resources and I quite enjoy it. I have days when I have to talk to people, usually 1 on 1, and days where I can just dive into the paperwork.  
5	I think interior design is really interesting and fun!
3	I loved personal training, but unfortunately with some challenging life events I had to “retire” and get a big girl job that’s more sustainable and stable. I hate it and am working on teaching myself computer programming so I can work remotely and have more freedom ultimately. I can’t do an office 9-5 .... it’s too stifling and limiting for me. 
4	I'm in instructional design and it's the PERFECT field for me. I went into education initially as a high school teacher, and while I loved it and was passionate about it, it was emotionally draining to the point where my physical health and personal life began to suffer. As a teacher, you have to be "on" all day every day, and as an extreme introvert it was too much for me. Instructional design takes all the aspects of teaching I love (pedagogy, theory, building lessons and instructional materials) and removes the more socially and emotionally draining parts. It's a great job and it satisfies my "helper" instincts.
4	I work with taxes. Lots of concrete rules and lots to learn, as well as numbers, pleases me.
7	Does gender effect MBTI personality?	If so are there any differences between male ISFJ and female one? There is any point to engage relationship with the same personality? 
6	I don’t think so because you use the same functions despite your gender. But there are differences in how ISFJ males and females are perceived. I do think ISFJ females may have an easier time developing their Fe due to male stereotypes about us needing to be tough and thinker like. 
5	i dont really think so, but nurture; the gender and religion ETC.  affect us too. we are about 60 percent human nature, and 40 percent human nurture . \n\nso I guess it does affect us, but not human nature..?\n\nhey, correct me if I'm wrong.
18	Infj going isfj	Hey you guys! \n\nFor a couple of years I thought I was an INFJ. I mean, I did a couple of tests on a lot of different sites. Untill I did a test a couple of days ago to \nfind out they think I'm an ISFJ.\n\nSo.. me being me I started watching YouTube videos and looking up this subreddit and I guess this is my place. \n\nFinally I can relate to all of those posts!\n\nSo... Hey!
14	i used to think i happened to be an ISFP for the longest time until the tests started saying ISFJ consistently. Welcome to the sub, all types are welcome. 
8	Welcome! :) I was just like you, testing as INFJ (and others). Glad you've found us. Personally I think this sub is friendly and pretty authentic. It's a little quiet though.
6	hey welcome! great to know your found yourself!  welcome! good luck in the studying od the cognitive functions:33
4	Me too lol, when I found out I’m actually an ISFJ things just clicked better.
3	I know how you feel.\n\nI'm still not sure if I'm an ISFJ, INFJ or INTP, but I've decided that it's okay and that I can lurk and troll as many subs as I like.
2	I actually started off as a INFP haha, people change and grow over time
1	heyyyyy me too :) 
1	Welcome! I also used to test INFJ when I was younger, but as I learned more about MBTI it became clear to me that I was textbook ISFJ. It's my personal theory that N is extremely over-tested, for a variety of reasons, so a lot of self-proclaimed INFJs are really ISFJs. (Same with INTPs and ISTPs, ENTJs and ESTJs, etc.)
7	ISFJ with bad memory?	I used to think I was an ENFJ, but I’m rethinking and now believe that I am an ISFJ through retaking tests after a year or so and asking people on r/mbti. I’ve been watching a ton of videos about people discussing other ISFJ’s, and one of the huge attributes of ISFJs that always comes up is how amazing they are at remembering things and retaining information. This couldn’t be further from the truth for me. I can’t remember what I had for breakfast in the morning, much less tiny details in conversations I’ve had with people lately. Is this the case for any other ISFJ’s? Do I still have my type wrong? 
9	I think people misunderstand Si. people with strong Si (SJs) tend to process information based on what their senses have observed in the past. So, far example, if an Si user had a bad experience with a certain brand in the past, they would be more likely to avoid buying their products in the future. I was watching an interesting video on how different personality types learn math and the biggest takeaway (for me) was that SJs like to learn through repetition and they feel comfortable doing tasks they have experience with in the past. As an INFJ, I get bored really easily and like to move on when I have mastered something, which is common among intuitive doms. However, SJs prefer sticking to what they already know. The difference between Ni and Si is that Ni is more abstract in nature so it is more difficult to explain. As an Ni dom, I just have these random "aha!" moments and I can't explain how or where they came from. Si doms, on the other hand, will be able to give you a concrete explanation for their beliefs and decisions....
16	I don't think good/bad memory related to MBTI though, I think ISFJ tend to remember the time they spend with the ones they care instead of details of random events. 
6	I used to have great memory but things have been very vague for me this past year...
3	Well, I would absolutely say that my memory is bad on days when I'm tired - I tend to forget small things that I previously remembered, and my memory about, say, what happened yesterday or two days ago can be spotty, even if the event was important.  I do happen to be great at retaining information that I consider important; I am great at remembering orders and directions because I don't want to need to ask again, so I listen well the first time and keep what I was told in mind.  I remember facial expressions very, very, well, particularly if something about a person's facial expression struck me - they looked angry, were they angry with me? Were they just having a bad day? I remember things that were said that hurt my feelings, and I remember them almost word-for-word. I remember things almost as though I'm writing a list from front to back - I can give you a nice summary of what I did in 2018, but I can't tell you everything, and I've forgotten over half of 2018.
3	You have great memory when your feelings are connected. You won't remember some bullshit facts but I still remember some quote from my friend 16 years ago.
2	I think we tend to remember things that have made an impression on us the best. We also tend to remember details about other people pretty well. 
13	ENFP dating an ISFJ - The daily struggles!	
8	WOW. ENFP and ISFJ; I would be super interested to hear how some of your earlier dates went.\n\nObviously it worked out, so presumably, well!
6	I've got rules that I live by, but most of them are determined by what I think is the most efficient/effective in practice and not on what someone has told me.\n\nThen again, I'm 50/50 on the thinking to feeling scale.
3	Way cuter post than I expected 
3	INFP here, and 100% can confirm my ISFJ wife and I have had a conversation like this every week.
2	Just make the damn bed! >.<
15	ISFJs who are in a long term relationship: did it take you a long time to find one?	So I'm 22, and I know I'm quite young, but I've only been in two serious relationships (10 months and 6 months). The first ended because he wasn't making an effort, the second ended because it was long distance and we both have anxiety that was kind of feeding off of the other and making it worse. I'm still friendly with both.\n\nAnyways, that out of the way, a lot of my friends are in relationships, living together, some have kids, etc and idk, it seems nice but I'm finding it really hard to find someone, if that makes sense. I have a steady job and a car and my own place and a cat, and somehow it's really tough to find a partner who's on my level... if that makes sense? I just want to date someone who's equally as responsible and has the same ability of transportation so that I'm not always driving.\n\nI dunno, I guess I just want to hear other ISFJ's experiences about this.
17	29 and still single.
8	I've been single for about 5 years now. I've had many dates and short relationships (2-3 dates) over the years and I've just not found someone that I want to really invest in and have a long term relationship. My friends say I'm very picky but I just feel like I've been unlucky in not finding someone that is on the same wavelength. \n\nFor reference I've had relationship in my early 20s that lasted 3 years. I'm pretty straight with women and move on if there is no chemistry after 2-3 dates. I'm only interested in long term so I don't want to mess around and waste time like some people do. 
7	I'm a ISFJ 22(F) been with my man for 2.5 years. I had avoided dating for a very long time because I I found it far too difficult to find someone who I was compatible with yet attracted to at the same time.  \n\nI have always wanted a long term relationship, no games. I wanted to build my life with someone. Get a home, get married, have kids and live happy ever after. That's the goal. \n\nAfter a couple weeks of chatting online I thought he wasn't into me at all but then he asked me on a date. We met up in the city under the clock tower and the SECOND I laid eyes on him I KNEW without a doubt that he was special.  I had butterflies; nerves and excitement fill my body and that had never happened before. Still happens every day I see him to this day. \n\nAny who, two and a half years later and we are both still very smitten and planning our future together.  We share the same end goals, views and values and that helps alot. His a similar personality type so I think that helps too. We both hate parties, are quiet introverts, etc\n\nThey say opposites attract but I can't see myself being with a extrovert. They wouldn't understand our need for quiet time or that we don't want to go out all the time. It's okay to sit in silence and just enjoy each others company.  Extroverts wouldn't understand that. \n\nNever ever give up on finding love. It can and will happen for all of us. It'll most likely happen when you least expect it :)
6	financial anxiety and a shitty economy is causing people to settle at older ages. don't be too hard on yourself, 22 is really young! I am 24 and still single :) 
4	Yes, and I don’t regret a thing.  When I was in my 20’s, I had had one serious relationship.  Now in my early 40’s, I’ve had a total of two serious relationships and several not so serious ones.  (I don’t like wasting my time being with someone I know I don’t have a future with.) My second serious relationship is a keeper and we’ve been married about 18 months.  Like you, I wondered if I’d ever find someone or if my standards were too high.  Keep looking for the qualities you want in a person.  Eventually, you’ll find them and it’s okay if it takes time. 
5	I've been with my husband for 10 years now, we met at 22.\n\nPersonality wise we're a bit different but in ways that complement each other and we still love spending time with one another. We're also on the same page about the "big stuff" (kids, faithfulness, life goals, money etc).\n\nWe'd both been single for a little bit before we met. I'd kind of given up tbh but I'm glad we found each other.
3	I've been dating my boyfriend for almost six years. We were friends first and then it grew into something more. He's also an introvert, so we are okay doing our own thing in the same room but not speaking to each other. Before that, I had dated guys that were either immature, selfish or I felt like I couldn't trust them. 
4	Long term relationships are hard to find. They're of course what I'm looking for. But what I want in a relationship keeps updating as I date more. Every girl I dated before my current one was short lived. I'm now in my first long term relationship.\n\nI was 23 when I sought after the first girl. I liked her based on things that i realize initially creates attraction for me: fun, shared interests, and she was actively interested in what she works on. Then after that didn't work out I realized that stuff was nice but I much more needed responsibility in a partner or I'd go through a repeat of what happened (she very openly used me yet without fully understanding she was at the time). \n\n2nd girlfriend was more responsible but also had shared interests, was fun, and actively interested in her work. And after the 2nd girlfriend I realized that I also really strongly needed someone who can share openly what they think and feel or we'd grow distant. I still consider her a friend but I can't date someone who doesn't tell me what's going on and also needs to act strong all the time, especially when they're falling apart. \n\n3rd girlfriend fit all those criteria. And after the 3rd girlfriend I realize I also needed someone with more emotional maturity and an openness to listen and understand others. Or we'd argue all the time.\n\nEach girl I dated I wholeheartedly try to make it work and to make it last. But when things don't work out I try to figure out why. And so I've learned that shared interests are nice but not key. Emotional openness and maturity, a sense of responsibility, and a willingness to listen to understand others are what's most important for me and to build a relationship with me.\n\nEach experience creates a more in depth understanding of what would create a longer relationship with me as I keep growing and changing. To help me find someone who I feel like we can start growing in sync with one another. And I think I found the person at the moment. But only time can tell.\n\nAlso I just read this comic this morning and it's related:\n\nhttps://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/the-talk
3	At your age it is more about the age than the MTBI type honestly, you're going to want to find a single dad or a nice older gentleman because none of the men your age are going to have their shit together like you do unless they're a very type A personality - in my experience. So rather than end up a stepmother or something, I would just keep keeping yourself awesome and moving forward and keep room in your life for someone but build the life that doesn't require them.\n\nI am 28 single and I think I always will be as my last boyfriend, who I thought I would be with forever, had a drug induced psychosis that just... never went away? He is not who I knew and he is paranoid and mean always and hallucinating, etc. So now I don't trust that anyone I meet now isn't just going to flip a switch like that if the partner I knew for 5 years could. Which is a huge struggle because I care deeply for people and get attached very strongly and don't want to be alone the rest of my life. But I also never want to go through that again either. :/ 
2	i'll be 35 and i've been single for like uhm14 years? Since then i couldn't find someone.Had a couple of tries just always wanted me as a friend,probably because i'm having social anxiety and i'm too introverted.\nMost of the girls i liked or tried to date i already knew homehow (ex-classmates,friends' friend,living in a same town, etc.),but most of them settled in or moved so i'm pretty out of options because trying to date with a person i never knew/talked before (like tinder or someone i never met before)  feels impossible for me right now.Maybe i just lost interest in dating or i donno.\nFor introverts i think it's double as hard to find a partner,maybe because we are not that easy going as extroverts.
2	25 and still single! My casual dating life is pretty active, though. I'm trying to enjoy it while I still can. Same as you, I'm still young and I have "a lot of broken hearts yet to experience," as my mother so lovingly advised me.
2	Took me till 29 to find someone who I absolutely love , and it was by some miracle lol 
2	22 and still together after 6 years.
2	Since I was 15 I was in a 4/5 year relationship with an esfp (high school to early college). Then a 6/7 year relationship with an isfp. Now going on 3 years in my current. Sounds like I have a problem being alone though writing this. Part of me wishes I had more adult life single... but I adore my current entp bf. \n\nMy advice is just enjoy life and let it happen organically.
2	I’ve been with my husband for about 9 years now. We met in college when I was 18. He’s an ISFP, which I think offers some balance. He’s not nearly as organized or task-oriented as I am, but he’s nice to be around and we always have things to talk about. I have always dated introverts, I think an extrovert would be too exhausting for me. I think you have to make an effort when it comes to friendships and be open to meeting new people. We were good friends before we started dating, and I think that can be really beneficial. 
3	I’m a 24 yo female. I had a 2 year relationship, then one that was less than a year...\nMy now current relationship is 8 years and we just got married in September. Took a few tries to find the right one, but we’re very happy :)\n\nEdit: my situation is probably more rare because we started dating in high school 
1	I just turned 22 and I’ve been in a healthy and loving relationship for more than a year now. He’s my first boyfriend and everything I ever wanted and more.  But before I got in a relationship with him, I wondered if I my standards were too high or something too. But a lot of people around me were in unhealthy relationships and the like and I didn’t really want to set myself up for that kind of thing so I avoided those things entirely, I never even tried dating apps haha. \n\nWhen I first started talking to my now boyfriend, I didn’t really think we’d end up in a romantic relationship (sure i had a crush on him but that’s beside the point lol). Initially our conversations were only thru online means but we kept talking and talking in what we thought was just friendly conversation. When we finally went on a date we just couldn’t have enough of each other from that point and now we’re here, more in love and happy than ever haha. There’s a lot of other details in between that I didn’t include (lmao at ISFJs and details) but I just find our story so funny hehe. \n\nAnyway, my boyfriend and I are fully committed to growing as individuals and growing as a couple. Just keep working on yourself, OP, and your SO will come around soon enough and it’ll all be worth it. It was for me :) 
1	I’ve been with my husband for about 9 years now. We met in college when I was 18. He’s an ISFP, which I think offers some balance. He’s not nearly as organized or task-oriented as I am, but he’s nice to be around and we always have things to talk about. I have always dated introverts, I think an extrovert would be too exhausting for me. I think you have to make an effort when it comes to friendships and be open to meeting new people. We were good friends before we started dating, and I think that can be really beneficial. 
7	Why do ISFJs seem to think I "lack people skills"?	I suppose I should begin by stating that I'm an ESTJ and I'm not afraid to venture my opinions or debate with people. I have a lot of friends, and it's true, some people don't like me, but not that many. But a trend with ISFJs seems to have surfaced. They think I lack people skills. One of my friends that I've known since I was eight (I'm 30 now) has commented periodically through the years that I lack people skills, though has never been willing to elaborate when I've asked him what he meant by that. I thought this feeling toward me was individual to him, but other ISFJs I've met and made this comment as well, which has shown a trend now.  \n\n\nI can tell you right now, other people don't tell me this, even the types that tend to be more blunt. In fact, I usually get very different comments, usually positive. Are ISFJs not good with perceived conflict? My friend of 22 years acts like any difference of opinion is automatically "conflict" and always attempts to smooth things over in group settings as if he's some kind of referee. I've never been able to have conversations with him about deeper matters, religion, politics, etc, he 's always clammed up pretty fast. These other ISFJs I've spoken with were willing to talk about these things, but were really offended really fast, and now seem to hate me with a loathing passion, of which I sense vindictiveness in the way they communicate now. I suspect this person is a little unhealthy, because my friend has only ever been vindictive once.  \n\n\nAny thoughts or comments?
23	Based on other ETs that have come here with posts like this, I think you’ll get answers you like better if you ask /estj or other T subreddits. \n\nMy first impression of this post is that you want Isfjs to tell you something you can debate them for, and to you this is a normal conversation. To us, it’s like “ISFJs! What do you have to say about your weak, sniveling brethren!”\n\n\nIsfjs and estjs don’t value the same thing in social affairs. Aux Fe is all about harmony with others and Estjs don’t value that too much if at all. \n\nAgain: you probably won’t find the info you want here. It’s going to be said in a way you don’t value, based on principles you don’t value. 
9	tbh I've never met an ESTJ with people skills ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
8	It could be that these particular ISFJs don't like your *way* of discussing. You're a Te dom which can easily clash with our Fe aux. Te values logic and efficiency while Fe values group harmony, so an Fe user is much more likely to not want to take an argument for the sake of not upsetting anyone.. which could be why some ISFJ might think you lack people skill\n\nI for one have no issues with having a difference of opinion w/ someone, but I dislike overly aggressive/assertive argument, and will likely end the discussion if i feel my partner is getting to 'railed' up(in a negative sense).\n\nedit: Fe user are also more likely to *tell* when people are getting uncomfortable/upsets, so maybe you just don't notice what your ISFJ friends do (i.e. your focus is probably on you being right, while theirs is probably on how everyone is feeling)
7	Interacting with a Te dom can be a bit jarring for ISFJ's. I think the root of the problem is auxiliary Fe vs. inferior Fi. Our emotional processes are just so different. I know for me personally, Fi is one of the hardest functions to understand or relate to, and the lower it is in a person's stack the more true that is. I find ExTJ's very intimidating.\n\nTe doms are all about cold logic, rationality and getting results above all else. These are all great qualities in the right context, but to a sensitive ISFJ they can come off as unfeeling/uncaring, and we might see the ESTJ as a bull in a china shop, socially speaking.\n\nu/Nutella_Hotchocolate summarized it really well. ISFJ's value group cohesion and common ground. We tend to be indirect communicators and are very attentive to the *tone* of an argument. The straightforward, self-assured way Te doms tend to communicate can sometimes read to us as social ineptitude. We see the ExTJ steamrolling over people's feelings to make their point, ignoring the nuances and nonverbal communication that might be taking place, and we interpret it as social ineptitude because we are so finely attuned to nonverbal cues. (In truth, I think it's often the case that ExTJ's are *aware* of these things, but simply don't care, and refuse to let them get in the way of the ExTJ making a point or achieving a goal.)\n\nI hope this doesn't sound disparaging to ExTJ's; I actually have a great deal of admiration for those types. But I think ExTJ's and IxFJ's are just naturally frustrating to each other when it comes to communication because our processes are just so different and we have such different goals. ISFJ's communicate to understand more about themselves and others, and to find common ground and harmony. ESTJ's communicate to get results and figure out actionable steps to take toward their goals. ISFJ's communicate for communication's sake; ESTJ's communicate in service of their goals. Neither is right or wrong, but they can be difficult to reconcile.
11	maybe it is because we are so focused on behaving morally,  always behaving in the right way to the right people, always careful not to trigger anything in them, and many of us also hold others to the same standard, which is wrong of us and cause us to alienate people.  \n\ntherefore it is important for us to stop holding others to that high standard. \n\n
2	I know ExTJs can be very intimidating to deal with as ISFJs. Like others have said dominant Te can be a lot to handle. This seems to be a Te and Fe clash. From an ISFJ perspective, it seems like you guys can come off as very blunt and say hurtful things. I think what they mean is that you aren’t good at relating to how other people feel and understanding the effect things have on their emotion. I will say as ISFJs we are so in tune with other people’s emotions and feelings that we can expect others to be as well. TJ types in general seem to have the hardest time reading other people’s emotions. A lot of times in a discussion they’ll keep going and not realize that other people don’t wanna listen to you or might be upset. My advice is just to be more mindful of this when you’re speaking. Also since we tend to not always speaking up about this tell them it’s okay to tell you when you have upset them. 
11	How would I know the difference between platonic/motherly love and attraction?	So I met a girl who I'm almost certain is ISFJ and she started treating me differently around 2/3 into the day (in a small group). Of that I have no doubt. I just don't know why. Do you guys approach those two ways of showing affection differently?
8	It’s basically the same for me. But then again, I don’t show a lot of affection of any kind to people I have no interest in. 
7	My SO is ISFJ, he goes into his shadow ESFP often throughout the day. Is that what you mean? He’s more ‘motherly love’ at core, but the ESFP shadow is super attractive to me as well. 
3	Can you give a little bit of an example? I definitely want to take care of babies and also want to take care of men that I am attached to, but I will approach it much differently since one is a baby and one is a man. That caring/fixing thing is definitely there for both, though, and definitely, like, keeping track of your stuff and anticipating your needs as a mom would do I usually do for SOs.
11	Looking for new moderators for this subreddit. If interested, fill out the Signup form in this topic!	Hello,\n\nSo unfortunately I haven't been into the MBTI  community as much and also seldom find time to make updates to the /r/ISFJ subreddit in general.\n\nSo I'm looking for more moderators who for the subreddit who are willing to do at least one or more of the following:\n\n* Make/Add/Edit/Delete Post and User Flairs. Will be useful when any new game in the series comes out. You don't have to have experience making flairs before since there are guides but previous experience can certainly help.\n* Add, Edit and Enforce the Rules. Our ruleset is very outdated and could use a makeover. Depending on how you view the state of the subreddit the mod team can think of ways to improve the sub for what they think will be for the better. And of course make sure to view the mod queue, any user reports or any topics/comments you think are not following the rules.\n* Think of ways to update the appearance of the subreddit. Whether it's banner ideas, the overall presentation of the topics on either old or new reddit, subreddit icon, etc. CSS and/or Photoshop experience can help with this.\n* Ideas for sticky topics. At the moment I've just been stickying anything that looks like it can be helpful or hard to find.\n* Keeping information, wikis and sidebar up to date. As I said above, I have a table that lists upcoming events that I never update. The wikis are empty and could use nice information. Other important info could be put in the sidebar.\n* Any other ideas to make the subreddit better for all users.\n\nHere's the link to the official Signup form: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScKHM1s80iThHIRscrvhP3a1Z95IdzOKlpFAvFwrpt-CnbnKQ/viewform?usp=sf\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScKHM1s80iThHIRscrvhP3a1Z95IdzOKlpFAvFwrpt-CnbnKQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)\n\nI'll leave this topic open for at least a few weeks. Make sure to only sign up if you're serious about being a mod here.
2	Woo!! I signed up. Best of luck to everyone! 🤞
11	Do you have interests that a lot of people would consider boring?	Idk... Something mundane like model trains or something, idk. I can't think of a good example but I'm often told that my interests are super boring to others!
11	I have a long, laborious system of journaling my life I've been doing for a few years now. Nobody really knows I do this but I'm sure most people would find it painstakingly boring.
6	I like reading up weird trivia facts, whether about movies or in history. I have a diary where I write about my day to help keep up my sanity, because sometimes I just really need to vent or write about my anxieties because I have no one else to vent to. I watch "classic" (1930s-1960s,) films in my spare time. I read Star Trek fanfiction. I guess you could say that my interests are pretty boring.
7	i mostly don't talk about my interests to others, and I don't care what they think.\ni draw, I read, I do atlethics occasionally, and I listen to music, I also play games.\nif you call that boring, then idc.
6	Studying theology
5	Sudoku puzzles!
4	I love listening to music that my dad used to play like The Beatles or Frank Sinatra types. I'm 24 and people around my age tend to pan these genres as boring, I guess compared to today's pop songs which I cannot stand generally. 
6	I play video games, mainly RPGs like pokemon, listen to an absolute ton of music (mostly edm stuff, some rock and metal, even a bit of jazz), Read very particular books (like specifically Erin Hunter's Warriors series), and like to watch shows like Doctor Who and Bojack Horseman. If someone finds all that boring, then i most likely have never cared for them. 
4	The interests I've read in this thread seem so cool to me!\n\nMine is planning, decades into the future. Then studying stuff. Then running or hiking 10+ miles on the weekends (slow going but not extreme, I like taking in the views and short trips don't do it for me). I'm like a turtle? Everything I do is pretty slow and intentional and likely boring to everyone else :/
3	making slime, watching strange documentaries
3	i play board games and magic the gathering. which i find exciting but not everyone is into it. even the way i play magic can be boring to others. i think of it like a game where i'm a lawyer and each card is a law getting passed. and i'm trying to get the right laws in place to take advantage of in order to win.\n\ni also like to dissect the food i eat. i really get into describing the textures and flavors and figuring out the ingredients and techniques that is used to make that experience. i can go on and on with a deep focus while doing this. my girlfriend tries to get me to change topic when i eat something specifically amazing and complex because that can take a while.\n\nalso when i go to a restaurant i do this thing where i count the number of people working and i pay attention to the cost vs price of the food as well as the rate that they flip tables to estimate how much the restaurant makes. i also look to see how much of the food they make have overlapping ingredients to ease labor time. some of my friends are annoyed by this habit because i say it all aloud and they much prefer to talk about something else.
3	I love collecting seashells and game on the pc 
2	I'm very into movies/tv shows and all the trivia that I can find about them. I love to talk about all the movie details and how some visual metaphors/music/camera tricks/etc. are used to get our attention and convey the appropriate message to the audience. People like to discuss the plot of a movie, but not the specific details on how the movie is made of :( \n\n
2	Some of my family/friends consider me being interested in  MBTI and Enneagram boring. 
2	I have learned not to talk about my hobbies and interests as it tends to elicit yawns! But yes I must have a touch of istp because mechanical things and doodads interest me to no end but my entire friend group doesn’t feel the same way. 
8	how do you guys take criticism from others?	(handle*)
45	I'll be honest, not very well. 
22	I take it pretty seriously. I learned to not be hurt anymore by it, but i analyze it for a long time.
21	Terribly.  I try my best to not appear hurt, and I'll take their advice because what they said will often leave a big impression on me - I do want to improve, so it's not as though I don't understand where the criticism is coming from, but I'm a pretty sensitive person, so even if I'll take the criticism and come out better from it, my feelings will still be hurt.
12	It really depends on my connection with whoever is criticizing me honestly. Say it's a random stranger i dont care about, i probably wouldnt think more of what they say and quickly forget it. If it's one of my close friends or family members, i may reevaluate my past actions and consider what they said to me. I trust criticism if I know it's from someone who i know well. 
10	If it's something I feel I can actually improve on I'll just take it as a sign to get better at that thing\n\nIf it's criticism I dont think is valid or outright impossible I'll either ignore or avoid the person/people that criticize like that
8	I'm much better now than I used to be, but I'm still not great at it. I think everyone here will understand when I say that I used to take criticism \*very\* personally. Even if I knew the person wasn't meaning to be hurtful in the least, I couldn't help but let it cut me to the bone. I've grown to where it doesn't affect me that way anymore, but it still stings.
4	fantastic, though I do feel it deeply and often with embarrassment, I am always more focused on making the messenger comfortable so I react in a way that puts them at ease. 
3	Depends on the person or what they say, but mostly, it hurts.. on the outside I look good-spirited or sometimes, aloof.. I try hard to see the brighter side, and convince myself that I should be more sportive.. But my instant feeling is that of hurt, deep inside. I also hate the feeling of unease or awkwardness, I like things to stay normal and comfortable between the person and me.\n\nI'm getting better with age.
2	Not well. I can take it pretty personally but am learning to get better at it. 
2	Very personally. \nI shut down and try to think about how and why it happened. And at the same time I'm hurt. I usually feel like I did not do enough. Or too much. I just shut down for a couple of hours minding my own business.
1	Very poorly

16	that's so kind of you, dear INFJ! happy New year to you as well, very thoughtful of you to come to our sub and wish us happy New year! \nI really appericate it! uwu
3	Happy new yeaaaaar! \^\_\^
-3	Erm, not all of are ISFJs- but happy new year to you as well
4	Are any of you guys nihilist? What do you think about nihilism?	Just a random thought that popped up in my head.
7	I’m way too concerned with others to be a nihilist. If I was a nihilist I don’t think I would score as an ISFJ.
3	Yes but an optimistic nihilism.\n\nhttps://www.quora.com/What-is-optimistic-nihilism
3	A little, I'm not religious, and I think there is no "point" to life. But I think morals are important as well as being a good member of society. Why not be comphy and have fun while we live out our pointless, meaningless lives?
3	Well, I won't lie, sometimes I do have nihilistic thoughts.  I understand that the world - government, school, workforce - is all a "system" and even though I intend to follow the system, I have respect for those who break away from "the system" because deep down, I disagree with the way the world works to some extent and feel that life doesn't really have a meaning.  That's why I try to give my life meaning by aiming for what I'd like to do, and trying to help out others.
2	yeah, sometimes I feel pretty nihilistic ,, lol but I am not one.

6	Is this guy ISTP or ISFJ	https://youtu.be/hEdFv0ZDPJ8\n\nUse that video. If you want more dm me and I have more. \n\nYeah. \n\nI thought the specific use of the guys height was Ti\n\nAlso, is the fact that he’s a biker, pro surfer, woodworker, and builds a cabin every year a sign of Se?\nAlso, i know hes switched jobs a lot- isnt that Se looking for new information? \nHe also will make noises if reminded of them which is Se. he is also definitely an I. \n\nHe’s friendly but private, doesn’t seem that comfortable with emotional situations, pretty open minded. 
2	[deleted]
2	I’m an ISTP and I’m too lazy to watch the video.
4	ISTP based on the hobbies and how boring/long-winded the first 3 mins of that video were.
1	ISTP:/ judging by the fact that I haven't, watched the video.\n\n\n\n\nthat's me life 
5	What shows are you into right now?	
7	I'm rewatching the Wire and random episodes of Malcom in the middle.
8	I just finished Parks and Rec and cried super hard at the finale. Now I’m trying to find something to fill the void. I’ve been watching Derry Girls, Great British Baking Show: New Beginnings, and RuPauls Drag Race: All Stars 4. Nothing compares to the wholesome, feel-good comedy of Parks and Rec though...
5	I just discovered Fake or Fortune, a BBC show about examining works of art and finding out if they are real. It's the perfect combination of interesting and relaxing.
7	So I'm kind of a big anime guy. I don't watch much mainstream 3D/Real shows.\n\nI'm a big Dragon Ball Z/Super guy, eagerly waiting Attack on Titan Season 3 Part 2
6	Memories of Alhambra on Netflix!
5	Brooklyn 99:0 also haikyuu!! as well as mob psycho 100,,, as well as bnha
4	I'm watching The Office (currently in season 6), The Haunting of Hill House (creepy but amazing), The good place (lighthearted/fun but slightly philosophical), The Sinner season 2, Black Mirror (if watching the special episode counts)and Terrace House (japanese reality show).
3	Marvelous Mrs Maisel, Bisexual,  GOT again, F is for Family, i forgot you add The Americans
3	Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt
3	You - Stalker/ thriller series on Netflix.\n\nThe Walking Dead - Been a fan since the first episode of the first series, buuut kinda giving up on it!
3	Doctor Who. I havent been watching many shows lately due to the games i've been playing, but Doctor Who mainly, and the modernized 2005 series. Also a bit of parks and rec
2	I'd was into Daredevil, but Netflix started acting like a hoe. So at the moment, I would say Young Sheldon. The show is cringy, but entertaining. What about you OP?
2	I'm really, really getting into Old Simpsons. It seems like watching seasons 1-10 fill me with a sense of nostalgia, even though I have never watched the seasons before. There's just such a heartwarming feeling to the episode, and you can really understand just how much the writers cared for the show and the characters.
2	I've watched and rewatched all of Brooklyn 99 over the holiday break. It's hilarious and puts me in a good mood!
2	Superstore. I worked retail for 10 years so there's just so many relatable scenes and old Office jokes.
2	Waiting for these to air again soon:\nThe Good Doctor \nThis is Us \nNew Amsterdam \nThe Rookie\n\nCrazy kdrama I'm watching presently:\nThe Last Empress 
2	The Office 
2	Brooklyn Nine-Nine
2	I'm rewatching Brooklyn 99! It is probably my favourite show. :)
2	House and Bones
2	Friends also rewatching The Office for the 3rd time.

3	A Dialogue between an XSFJ and an XNFP	
3	To me this is just a depressed person talking to a not depressed person and has nothing to do with type. As an ISFJ I’ve had conversations the other way around. Anyone can get to a place in life where everything feels pointless. 
2	Is it safe to assume the "XSFJ" is the helpess?
2	AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA\n\nAHAHSHAHASHAHAHAHSAHAHAHASHA\n\nAHAHAHASHAHSAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nok I didn't read the article but that is FUCKING FUNNY :)\n\nOK I will bite.  It pretty much comes down to the XSFJ ignoring whatever the XNFP says or suggests and XNFP killing himself because this is what life has come to.  Oh, here is an example\n\nINFP:  The sun is up.  It is morning.\nISFJ:  No, it's not.\nINFP: (points at window)  The sun is up.  Look at the window.\nISFJ:  I AM NOT LOOKING AT THE WINDOW THE SUN IS NOT UP AND YOU ARE A RETARD.  *MUMBLE MUMBLE*  WHY CAN'T YOU JUST LISTEN TO ME AND DO AS YOU ARE TOLD?\nINFP:  (blows head off with shotgun)
23	Ways you guys break the ISFJ stereotypes?	I’ll start\n\n1. I don’t care that much for rules. I’ll break a rule if I think it doesn’t make sense or just not care if other people break it.\n\n2. I know there is a stereotype of us being the most Extroverted introvert. However, this isn’t true for me I need a substantially amount of alone time and can get quickly drained around people even if I’m enjoying myself with close friends or family.\n\n3. I’m definitely not very organized. My closet has so many papers around it and I don’t care to organize my room very meticulously (pretty sure this is because of blind Te). I also put off doing the dishes until I feel like it.  
9	same, i am a minimalist, but I can be organized. I am not messy but i am not super organized either. I really pay attention to rules, and tend to always follow them. I feel like the isfj's and the infj's are the two types that will use a zebra crossing no even if there are no cars on the road. lmao... I also like one on one social interaction (3 people and the social interaction becomes extraverted) I love being alone but i also really like being with ONE friend(1).. but just for a small amount of time..\n\nThe older a friendship is, the more value I find in it.
9	1. I've always been accused of 'not listening' during work training, because I would try it the company way, realize it was stupid, and figure out my own my to do it. That mentality got me into the top 3% of my position in the company.\n\n2. I get drained very easily, and I have a large, noisy family, and I still get drained around the people I love. I have noticed, though, that I am more talkative around the people I love and am most comfortable with.\n\n3. I am really good at organizing, and I like to reorganize. But... I leave clothes on the floor all the time and I have a bad habit of procrastinating by chores. I hate dishes.
7	I'm the same as all of these, I'm not neat/tidy at all naturally but I do find being pretty minimalist is a good way of helping me to do this without trying\n\nAlso, get me in the right mood and I'm super sociable. I do need to chill away from people for a while after though.
6	I’m similar with rules. While I ultimately would consider myself a very responsible and rule-abiding citizen....sometimes I really just don’t give a fuck and do what I want. In the past I have had times where I acted like I was above the rules bc I am intelligent and kind and that I can get away with things. But this tends to catch up with me. Ultimately I do think rules and structure are very important for society on the whole. \n\nI feel like ISFJs are stereotyped to be the most religious types. I am very much not religious and don’t like the conformity of religion.\n\nI’m not great with money. I am the opposite of frugal, have a very fancy taste and can be quite materialistic. I am super organized and have a detailed budget....but sticking to it is challenging. I am driven by financial success, second to having a large beautiful family. \n\nISFJs are stereotyped to be rather boring and conventional sexually, however I am super kinky 
3	When I was a little kid, my parents were told that I need to be taken out of private school and put into public because the structure of a private school would hamper my development. I needed more free will. I love structure, so long as I create that structure myself. \n\nI don't like the "tried and true." I have my own ways of problem solving.\n\nMy memory sucks and I don't remember the details about people lives.\n\nI don't like jobs that require detailed bookkeeping type of work.\n\nI'm not religious.\n\n
3	1. Exactly this; if the reasoning behind a rule seems flawed to me, I am liable not to follow it.\n\n2. I live alone and *still* need a ton of alone time. Even when I go visit my family I spend a lot of time alone. Totally relate!\n\n3. Omg, I am a mess too! I'm actually starting to find tips for people with ADHD as I find that a lot of those tips are actually useful for trying to organize oneself. 😅\n\nAlso I am very awkward with hosting and am totally not at all the selfless helper in every social situation that we are often made out to be. I'm more likely to sit in a corner, lol.
2	I'm impatient and find that I can be quite direct/confrontational when I feel very strongly about something.
1	\n1. ISFJs dont really care about the rules? Interesting. I almost always try to follow them or even reinforce them when I can. I guess i break the sterotype there. \n\n2. I am very much an extraverted introvert, in short bursts. At most i can get in maybe 4 hours, if im lucky, of socializing with friends and family, and I'd need at least a day to recharge. There have been times where i overloaded myself by not doing this for a week and i crashed.  hard. \n\n3. Naturally? Im definitely not organized. I put dishes off for a while sometimes, even when i think they look horrible. I'll throw most of my stuff that is my room around and not clean it for months. My schoolwork i am very organized with though since ive adapted to that. 
1	Apparently ISFJs are really good at remembering insignificant details about people. I do no such thing.
1	I Always take a leasing part in a project. People Always type me as an ENTJ ord ENFJ. 
16	How did you find your partner?	Question from a guy trying to find someone. Where did y’all meet? What type are they? Did you go up to them? They to you? Did you instantly click? Etc.. 
11	Tinder tbh, we talked for about 3 weeks and then met in person. He’s an ESTP. At first I wasn’t sure how I felt about him, but his personality really sold me and after about a week, I didn’t look back. 
12	Sorry I'm not an ISFJ but my fiance is. I'm an enfp..he approached me in college after math class one day. I fluttered and went back with my ex which ended. My fiance dependably remained my friend while I was still trying to make it work with my ex. Didn't fathom all I could ever want or need was an ISFJ though but we're peas in a forever pod.
13	OkCupid. :P Interestingly, we only lived like 2 miles away from each other, on opposite sides of the city's river. A lot of guys messaged me first, but he's the only one that I made the first contact with. \n\nI just liked a lot of things in his profile, which he clearly put time and thought into. We were a super high "match" percentage, we aligned on core things (e.g., both agnostic, neither are vegetarian/vegan, both liberal). And he listed Willy Wonka and Big Fish as his favorite movies, which are soft spots for me.\n\nHe is INTJ, which apparently is not supposed to be a good match for us ISFJs, but I think what helps is that we communicate well. We're opposites in many ways, but we share a lot of the same interests. He's super logical, things don't bother him easily, and my neurotic/anxious tendencies don't stress him out. He puts me at ease. 
8	never had a bf
7	We were introduced by [a sneaky pair of mutual friends](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/a9l9c2/z/eckgqyv). He initiated the flirting and conversation the night we met and he's the one who asked for my number at the end of the night. Our connection was immediate and intense, but for a variety of reasons (including the fact that we're both terrified of our own feelings) we didn't actually end up getting together until months later.\n\nI'm ISFJ, he's ISTP. Not exactly the most compatible pair. We're both prone to conflict avoidance and passive-aggression which leads to tensions bubbling under the surface far longer than they should. I'd say that's the primary issue in our relationship; other incompatibilities are minor and easily overcome. In general though we understand, support and  complement each other really well.
8	I met my husband on OkCupid. I'm an ISFJ and he's an ENFJ. He messaged me first and his first message was actually about our Myers-Briggs types. Haha
8	He’s ISTP and we met in Uni. We first started hanging out as a friends in a group of 5. I started to develop an interest for bf so I started texting him outside of our group chat. Bf is super shy and usually doesn’t talk much but then we started to text and talk for hours on end and finally went on a date. We’ve been together for 3 years now and I’m the happiest I’ve ever been. 
5	isfj here, partner intp. we met on a discord server and played terraria and chatted and enjoyed each others company a lot :)
6	Her family and my family were friends. We each had different relatives wanting to set us up with each other but neither of us wanted to be set up with anyone. We weren't looking for a relationship.\n\nHer family came to visit my cousin who I was taking care of and I drove everyone around town to sight-see. \n\nShe was attracted to my voice, that I was nice and caring. She liked how I gave life advice to my cousin but did so in a soft way. \n\nI was attracted to her healthy boundaries with her family and her dedication to getting better at things and her thirst for new experiences. Though we immediately clicked we didn't let on that we liked each other.\n\nShe was only in town for a week and I didn't want to make things awkward between us by saying I was attracted to her right away. On the chance that she doesn't feel the same way or doesn't want to pursue anything with me, it would be very uncomfortable for her with me driving everyone around. She was looking for hints that I liked her but I hid them very well.\n\n3 days before she had to return, I asked her to see a movie with a friend of mine and her cousin. I felt like she was going to leave soon and I didn't want to miss the opportunity to see where this could go. Even though I knew she lived far away and a long distance relationship is difficult. \n\nMy friend separated her cousin from us. I put my arm around her and whispered jokes in her ear. She whispered jokes back. we made bets on the plot. and it was great.\n\nThe next day we played board games together, watched some netflix together, then we celebrated new years together by watching fireworks. All of this with family around so we weren't very open about our feelings still. And we didn't want to give the satisfaction to our respective families that they were right to set us up.\n\nAfter she left, we texted a lot. Then we called each other under the premise that she's going to help me get better at speaking Vietnamese but all we did was talk. We found that it was easy for us to share with each other openly and honestly.\n\nA few days after she left, she expressed doubts with her mom that someone would be interested in her enough to fly to see her. Coincidentally right after that conversation I called her to see if she would feel comfortable with me flying to see her.\n\nA week and a half after she flew away, we said we loved each other. A week and a half after that I flew to visit her.\n\nI don't actually know what type she is. I know she is IN but the other two is hard to figure out.
5	I haven’t found squat. :(
4	He's an ESTJ and it's a bit of an odd story.\n\n\nWe met at a mutual friend's party. At the time I was pretty shy around strangers, so when he kept trying to talk to me I brushed it off as him just being friendly/polite and apparently effectively shut him down; the idea that he was flirting didn't even hit until later lol\n\n\nLater on, another girl started talking to him and they hit it off really well. At the time I thought it was cute and pointed it out to our mutual friend, who told me that the girl had a boyfriend. I kept trying to get her to tell him (because clearly he had no idea??) and she kept saying it wasn't her business. Finally I decided to do it myself and got him alone. It was extremely uncomfortable, but it had to be done.\n\n\nAs it turned out, the awkwardness of telling him was enough for me to overcome my natural tendency to avoid people and we started talking. Everything clicked really well and he asked me on a date not long after. My dumb ass wasn't even sure if it was a date until he said "it's a date!"\n\n\nThe rest is history :D
5	I met my partner on POF I’m ISFJ he’s ENFJ , I read his profile and it seemed like he was a good person , little did I know the day I messaged him he was going to completely delete POF , his grandmother at the time was not doing well and was at the hospital a lot . Because of that we didn’t get to officially meet till weeks of talking every night . We had a movie date at my house and I was so scared he wasn’t going to text me after he left  I always would get the it was nice meeting you BUT . On the way home he was texting me and it felt amazing . We kept talking and seeing each other when we both could , I met his grandmother before she passed which was very nice . Moved in with him and we are still living together , about to get married very soon hopefully next month . 
3	okcupid
3	I (isfj) met my partner (isfp) through a mutual friend. I really think we instantly clicked. we spent a couple hours together the afternoon we met in the company of the mutual friend we had both known for years so it was really easy to just be ourselves and comfortable in the small, partially familiar group. 
3	INTP (me)/Seattle/yes instant click. \nISFJ partner/NYC/yes instant click. \n\nIntroduced through our mutual friend in Seattle who played WoW with my partner for some years (I personally am not a gamer). Mutual friend waited until I wasn’t seeing anyone serious and gave ISFJ my number. He was very assertive and traditional with calling/planning (still is). Dated long distance for a year, he moved here. \n\nHonestly? He’s a classic turbulent ISFJ, which as a concept sounds stressful to me. But ISFJ’s are so beyond fun to laugh with and purely warm and kind that there is no way he could’ve screwed it up. 
3	I met him at work. He is an INTJ. He approached me, and we clicked instantly.
4	Good question. This should be should be some interesting answers in the comment section.
2	Met him (XNTP) at work. He was instantly my best friend and made me laugh a ton. He liked my smile and my kindness. We hung out for months as friends with a group. Slowly we hung out more and more just the two of us, but still as friends. Eventually, when the timing was right, one thing led to another. :) 
2	Nothing yet. I dont even know if i understand the feeling, but i'm only 18 and still have a future to learn with it. I feel i may have tangled with that feeling a few times with a few friends due to intimate moments, but i know they dont feel the same anyway. I dont want to rush things, but i dont want to wait really either. 
1	I met my partner on OkCupid in 2017. She's an ENFJ and I feel like we really click now. For her it was instantaneous. For me it was a struggle at first, but I feel like as our relationship grows our connections gets stronger and now we are extremely bonded. She messaged me first. 
6	Is it Possible to switch Personality Types?	Hey all. About 5 or 6 years ago when I was trying to figure out what to do with my life, I took a test & determined I had ISFJ personality type. It made sense; I wanted to help people, I wanted to work with older adults, I didn’t care about money, I was a “mostly” nice guy with a good heart.\n\nBut now after all the studying, working that job for a few years, I’m very bitter. I still like helping older adults, but I hate most of my co-workers. I get bad hours, the pay sucks, I get the worst tasks, & I’m planning on quitting the field altogether. I’m kind of an a-hole, & don’t know how to snap out of it. I’m always stressed, trapped in my head, I can’t seem to de-stress & get back to my old self.\n\nI’m planning a career change into tech. I want a calmer setting, where I can do solitary work, with normal hours & good pay. I kind of want to travel. I don’t really care about others anymore, unless I personally like them.\n\nTl;dr: Is it possible my personality type has changed? Maybe I got it wrong the first time? Or does stress just make you rebel against your values?
8	nope, and no. but you can develop your shadow, like if you spend a lot of time in your unconsious , unwillingly or willingly you can..almsot get stuck there but with a lot of healing you can get back to your ego. \n\nthis is a rare case though. \nremember you actually have four personality types inside of your mind - if you're an ISFJ you have ESFP unconsious, ENTP subconisous, and INTJ superego.\n\n
4	Yeah, yet doing the test again, at what you get. People can change over time slowly, but generally don't
3	I feel for you. Had a similar moment in time. Switched jobs (completely new industry) I work tech and it’s in your best interest to at least keep the good guy piece of you and ensure you express a bit of an extroverted outer shell to improve your overall relationship with everyone.\n\nIt’s a weird space to be in and you need to reach out a little from your loved ones to give the support. Make sure your battery is charged. How you do this is up to you and make sure you feel happy. I need to reflect on what I said here as I’m a little down myself. \n\nDo you find you can figure whatever has you down out with a little self reflection and a list of planned ideas and or small changes to your routine to get you out of the slump?\n\nLet me know if you ever need to chat about the tech industry. Not sure which avenue you want to look at but I’m fairly geeky and can help where I can.
3	My wife is an ISFJ and this sounds like her experience. While I wouldn’t describe her as being an asshole, there’s definitely a lot of bitterness in not feeling appropriately appreciated in the workplace. This is especially exacerbated when she is given a high workload with no acknowledgement or thanks for her extremely high work ethic. She also is drained by coworkers who do not, in her opinion, work as hard and make more money.  I think at the end of the day, maybe  a place that gives a lot of verbal affirmation may be what you are looking for. I know at least that’s what she needs at home and she holds everyone to the same high standards I am held to.
2	There’s remind me of a lot of stories I’ve seen about social workers who want to switch to computer science due to social mental and emotional exhaustion. You don’t have to dedicate your life to a field based off a personality test. Your mental health comes first along with opportunity for you to learn and grow as much as you want in this lifetime. I hope you find a new job or field that make you happier because no money in the world is worth the amount of frustration you’re going through right now.
2	My ISFJ boyfriend had the same experience. This year he was super bitter, full of hatred and wanted to cut off everyone and have nothing to do with anyone in his life anymore. He felt like no one cared about him as much as he cared for everyone else.\nBut he was lucky and finally found the puzzle piece that helped him to change himself to be happier again... It was something about holy geometry and how  all is one and most importantly for him: that he is enough and doesn't need anyone to be whole.\nI don't think that your type changed... I think you are not happy anymore... Try trusting this infj here and listen more to your heart and less to your ego in your mind. Feelings are the communication of what your soul wants for you because it will be great ❤️\n\nOh and... The way you treat yourself is the manual for everyone else to treat you. So be good to yourself and don't push too hard 
2	First, I’m sorry about your work situation. Sounds like you’ve been place into a situation around people who have forced you to try and be something you’re not. I think you’re on the right track in getting out of that situation. You shouldn’t have to change your entire personality to fit in with people. I think you need to find people who accept you for who you are. \n\nSecond, I believe that we all have predisposed type that is inborn to us. However, as an ISFJ you have Extroverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Perceiving functions. It’s just you prefer you’re ISFJ functions. Also, as you get older you’re lower function (especially your tertiary function) get more conscious and start playing a bigger role in your life. For example, the ISFJs third function is Ti and now that I’m in my early 20s it is starting to play more of a roll on my life. However, That doesn’t mean you are a different type this just means you are working on your weaker functions. to become a more well rounded ISFJ. Based on what you wrote when you typed as an ISFJ I still believe you are one. You should definitely read up on the ISFJ functions here’s a couple of good links.\n\nhttps://accounts283.clickfunnels.com/sk-isfj-sp\n\nhttps://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2018/06/16/the-isfj-personality-profile-an-in-depth-look-at-the-nurturer/\n
2	Sounds like me. Life sucks, man. Get a different job. Screw helping people. Life will turn you negative and hopeless if you don't leave for something else. 
2	When I was 20 or so I tested INFJ.  I am 40 now and test as ISFJ.  I have had a lot of hardship and bitterness throughout my life, maybe that’s why it changed?
2	Could it be that you were incorrectly typed the first time around? I thought I was an INFP for years because basically every test said I was... but then I started researching the cognitive functions because something didn't feel right, then a friend mentioned that she was an ISFJ and that since we are very similar I might be too. Yep... fits like a glove. So you might not actually be an ISFJ but rather mistyped. Just a thought...
19	For those who celebrate: Do y'all super love Christmas?	Every ISFJ I know goes all out for Christmas. One of my younger sisters (age 15) video chatted me yesterday wearing Christmas themed socks and pajamas...while holding a snowman mug lol She apparently led the house decorating and pretty much put the whole tree up. \n\nMy dad's gf is also an ISFJ and she legit did up his house in Christmas lights and put a tree up. He hasn't done that in 8 years!!! \n\nDo ISFJs who celebrate Christmas often love Christmas? Maybe holidays generally that you often celebrate? 
18	Fucking hate Christmas. I find most holidays to be kind of depressing. There’s this huge buildup and excitement but they’re just another day to me. 
10	Not really, I don’t look forward to holidays that much and keep them low key. One thing I have heard about ISFJs is that we like tradition, and that seems to be true for me, despite my not really caring about the holiday.  There are a few small things my SO and I do every year and those traditions bring me comfort. 
6	I don't particularly care for holidays so I can't say I look forwards to Christmas. My family is quite small on this side of the world so celebrating it isn't as exciting as I thought it would be when I was younger. That stance has stayed the same over the years as I've had to work on Christmas during the holidays and it's never made me feel like I was missing out. \n\nI also grew out of asking for presents fairly early on and I just see Christmas and holidays as an excuse for people to get together or splurge on close people in your life. I can do that anytime during the year, so why force yourself to go out and deal with the huge crowds of people at this time of year?\n\n
11	i really like Christmas, it has always been that tradition I can look forward to at the end of the year. My mom is an ESFJ, so she really likes Christmas and goes all in for it. I'm still young so I just go with the flow around here during Christmas times, but yes , I really like Christmas.  it is the holiday where we should help and spend time with people you love, and those who are alone and those who need help. it is the time when you give people gifts, and I really love giving gifts. Receiving gifts? That's nice as well, but not primary for me. 
4	I'm actually not super into holidays - I don't decorate my place, I don't dress up for Halloween, etc. I don't really like all the commercialism. However, funny enough, I do like picking out gifts for people! My bank account doesn't like it, but I do. 😊 I like Christmas because I usually go home for the holidays and see my family, and my mom decorates the place, but other than that I don't really care.
4	I love holidays in general, but Christmas is my favorite!! 
4	I hate it. 🤷🏼‍♀️ I actually don't care for any holidays except for the aspect of being off of work. 
5	I like Christmas a reasonable amount on the actual day but I hate, hate, hate all the expectations leading up to it that trigger my anxiety really bad. I've always felt like the over the top gift giving tradition should just be for kids. \n\nBut for some reason I've ended up having partners and in-laws who find it very important to give and receive large amounts of gifts. And if I don't mirror their excitement or do it "right" then it's disappointing to them. This is really really stressful and also doesn't make any sense to me. I'm an adult. I want to buy the things I want, not spend all my time returning all the crap my mother in law got me at Ross because she thinks I want off-brand athletic shoes that are a size too small. (???) I wish Christmas was easier for me. I really don't like the holiday season because I'm never allowed to do it my way unless I wanna hurt everyone's feelings forever.
1	The tradition is the core of the season for me! If I don't put up anything, I feel my year is incomplete.
1	I love Christmas!! I always decorate as much as I can afford to.
1	I like Christmas, but definitely don’t go all out (or even out at all) for it. Maybe it’s cause I’m a dude and my mom (esfj) always forced me to decorate and me being a somewhat rebellious child always hated doing what I was forced to do. I could see myself doing a bunch of cool lights in the future though cause I always liked those. Don’t really care much for the decoration though. Our house was also always decorated in a cutesy way which isn’t my cup of tea so maybe that has something to do with it 🥴. Also I think I will do more gift giving in the future cause I do enjoy that part 
1	Christmas is my favorite holiday.
10	People closest to you	What are the types of the people closest to you? 
6	Boyfriend: ESFJ, though sometimes I do suspect he may be an ISFJ.\n\nTwin sister: ISFP\n\nBest friend: INFJ\n\nMom: INFJ\n\nBrother: ENTP
4	family. my mom is an ESFJ, my dad is an INFJ, my sister is an ENFP. \nas well as three of my friends; and ESFP, and INFP and ....another girl idk the type of; I don't get her type 
3	friends. some family, but my friends have always been the closest to me. 
3	Mom - INFJ iirc\nSister - ESFP\nMy dad might be an ISTP, and my other sister I'm not sure yet. She's only a teenager though.\n\nFriends I'm not sure of.
2	ENFJ, ISFJ, ESxP
2	Husband ISTP. Mom INFJ, dad ESTP, brothers ENTJ and ISTP.\n\nClosest friends are ENFP (x2), INFJ, INTJ and ENTP.\n\nI'm also very active in an online community made up almost entirely of xNTx's.
2	Mother, ISTP (I think)\n\nBoyfriend, INTP \n\nHomie, ??? 
1	Cousin/best friend: ESxJ \nDad: ISFJ\nBrother: ESFP (he makes me feel so relaxed and uninhibited) \nNana: xSFJ \nGroup of best friends: INFJ, ENFP, INxP (just realizing now that I think they are all intuitive types)
24	Do any of you guys like morbid humor/ off the wall comments?	Once I get to know someone, I have a tendency of saying off the wall comments. Nothing serious though. Just goofing around. How many of you guy's like this?
17	Very much so. I dislike puns and slapstick, so my humor is mostly running with absurd premises. \n\nI play DnD with a bunch of NTs and it can often be a problem. I love to suggest patently ridiculous/disturbing solutions to problems and I get shouted down with considerable frequency. I don’t care I love it\n\nE: Function-wise, I’ve read this is inferior Ne. :)
10	I love morbid humor and pushing the boundaries of someone's comfort with me. I guess "off-the-wall" might need to be a bit more defined but I find that I offer the most relaxed, off-the-wall comments when high. Otherwise I tend to overthink what I'm saying and if they'll appreciate the humor or not. 
9	Yes to both!  I had no idea this was possibly an ISFJ thing?  Especially since people try to make us out to be Disney Princesses or something.  
5	Took me a moment from what you meant by "off the wall" humor, but the humor of the absurd is my absolute favorite. Dark humor's good too.\nanother thing I'd like to add is unlike the top commentor, i love slapstick humor. I can't get enough of cartoons, especially tom and jerry, that involve slapstick humor. Good stuff. 
5	Yep, people normally don't expect when I use dark humor and if they don't know me they may think I'm serious. 
3	yeah I like it!
3	I love all sorts of humoooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut my funny nature comes out at odd times.. like when I'm deflecting, or when I'm sad, when I'm unwell, the "rueful" wry humor.. and mostly at home.. I'm really funny at home.. :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, do you guys use humor and make jokes when pissed with loved ones? I do that a lot!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT - I do that thing too, willingly making silly or ridiculous suggestions to problems or questions :p 
2	I have a problem where no one picks up on my sarcasm since I don’t express it very often... and I’m also bad at picking up on it too sometimes. Maybe I’m just bad at it.
2	Yeah I definitely have a dark humor side.
1	Really love dark humor
1	Yeah, just check out Jake and Amir. 
8	What are you like in a crisis?	Like seeing one of your loved ones suffering in pain for example, or any other event where you're extremely worried for someone/something. 
21	I make sure everyone is taken care of. I can be extremely sad or worried about something but if a family member/friend is not dealing with the same problem well, I’ll hide my emotions so I can help the other person deal with it.\nI have changed a lot over time. I used to be very emotional about things and life has taught me to be a bit tougher. I tend to hold the tears until I am on my own.
7	My grandmother was ill recently and my parents and I took time off to take care of her. This is probably something that I would assume goes without saying for people in a similar situation but it was just natural for me to take on more responsibility around the house and at the hospital (translating for my family). My parents eventually had to return to work so I ended up skipping a lot of my classes and fell behind. Overall I was as calm as ever when I was taking care of my grandmother but got stressed when my grades started to drop. I don't know what that says about me; was I more worried about school than my family?
6	The way I deal with crises can be very hit and miss, sometimes I can be very focused on the issue at hand, or I can end up letting the negative emotions take over my mind and quickly become very stressed. And unfortunately I can have a tendency to become a bit controlling during these situations.
5	Paralyzed by fear for a while. Coaxing self to set aside emotions and “act” because someone else needs me to be logical and supportive right now. Will try to maintain a strong facade while suffering deep inside. Eventually will recover but emotions swept under the rug will resurface and wreak havoc internally from time to time.
4	I've been in "crisis situations" because of several familial/health-related issues. If is someone I love who is in need of help, I will do whatever is in my hands, take responsability and, as others have said, it's almost an autopilot thing. I put my needs in second place. However, when I'm alone at home, I can start overthinking the situation and see it from a catastrophic point of view, breaking apart. I deal with my meltdowns in private, I don't like to worry people who surround and appreciate me (just my poor SO who lives with me). If I'm on a personal crisis, the management is very different and not as efficient, there is when I need "external" help because I'm not able to clearly see the way out.
3	I find I am assertive. I'm pretty proud about my actions in an emergency. It's only after I go to the bathroom and cry lol
2	I am excellent in a crisis. Assuming it’s not my crisis haha\n\nI am level headed, calm and collected. I am great at sensing the needs of others and responding to them appropriately and quickly. \n\nI also work in a medical profession so am great at that sort of crisis too
2	For me it depended on who died. \n\nWhen my dad died I hid. I stayed in my grandparents guest room until the paramedics took Dad away. And I still have hard days 4.5 years later\n\nWith my grandpa I was pregnant and couldn't travel at the time so grief was different and drawnout. \n\nMy grandma on my other side of the family recently passed and it hits me harder with each death. But I just stay busy and focus on the Lord as much as possible.
22	anyone else find themselves thinking it's something wrong when they're having too much good stuff in their lives?	I feel like I shouldn't have this much good of a life, and that it's not good for me to be this happy. this is seldom though, I don't feel like this all the time.
15	i usually feel undeserving when things are going well. 
8	Unless i've worked hard for it, I think this sometimes. 
4	YES but i think the best way to get out of that thought is to work even harder and strive even higher. When i have too much good stuff going on i sometimes even feel that my downfall is coming soon too
2	Yeah sometimes I try not to get too happy because I’m afraid something really bad will happen. Anxiety probs
19	isfj thing?	well i just cant help but put high expectations on friendships. When i sense a friend or a person doesnt want to put effort in nurturing relationships, then I leave them out because i can always tell if im being taken for granted or not. I can also sense if these "friends" want me or they just tolerate me because they don't want to hurt my feelings. If I'm not putting an effort into a friendship, thats because they sometimes leave me out or they are taking me for granted. I don't care (maybe) if i loose friends because of this, it's not my lost anyways, it's theirs.\n\nI admit i can be nitpicky when it comes to friendships but hey who wants temporary friends? Im more focused on long term friendships
11	Yes I agree! I pick apart my friends so much and held them to such high standards and I’ve began realizing it and hating it :/ because I then only consider them a casual friend rather than a “best” friend, (someone I’m suuuper close to). But like you said then again, why waste my time becoming close to people with some qualities I dislike? But no ones perfect obviously, idk it’s weird!! 
8	I dunno, I mean, I’m picky, but I don’t really think it’s a bad thing. I only have a couple friends, but I know they’re people who really enjoy my company and like me. Most of the time I’m alone, but that works just dandy for me as an introvert, especially when I’m forced to socialize most days for work. \n\nI just think, why shouldn’t I have high standards and want to be around people who genuinely appreciate me? I appreciate them just as much in return and tend to be very focused and overt in my affection, so I think it’s only fair. I would die for my best friend because we’re genuinely in harmony and I know that as much as I adore her, she loves me right back and she shows it. That’s the kind of quality of friendship I want, and I don’t think it’s wrong. \n\nSo yeah, maybe an ISFJ thing I guess. I think our Fe gives us high standards for social behavior and thoughtfulness in others, honestly. We value social harmony and go out of our way to make others comfortable, so we want the same consideration in return. 
4	sounds like an ISFP thing, actually
17	Let’s Talk About What We Love about Ourselves	I love how independent we can be as well as how great we are at serving others\n\nLet’s take a moment to appreciate US, I feel I often neglect my own self & how great I can be. How about y’all? What do you love most about being an ISFJ? 
18	I like how well we can pick up on the feelings of others. It puts us in a great position to give advice to those close to us  (if asked for of course :P)
11	I love being attuned to the subtleties of those close to me. I can always tell if something is wrong and I know how to best help them based on past experiences with them. I also genuinely love helping and caring for my loved ones. My INTJ boyfriend is so kind and receptive to all of my emotional and material gifts! I can’t help but shower him with my affection! I love how much we care about the emotional well-being and growth of our close ones, which inspires us to grow and learn about ourselves! 
8	i like how we're so innocent about our logical thinking.. and i like how considerate we are... i also like how I don't need other's approval all the time in order to feel good about myself. 
7	I like that I'm pretty good at thinking of and making thoughtful diy gifts to give friends and family :-) 
6	I like how passionate we are about things, and how caring we can be for others. Sometimes we care so much, we forget about ourselves in the process. 
6	I like how Si can create cool connections. I can catch the thread of an impression and follow it to another experience that is sometimes wholly unlike the current one, and yet /seems/ exactly like it: \n\nA tedious, yet brusque conversation with a bus driver- it was like trying to zip up a stuck zipper from a weird angle where you can’t use leverage or your strength to move it. 
6	My ISFJ gf and I (ISTP) spent months trying to determine her MBTI...	And I'm very grateful we finally figured it out together! It's opened my eyes to the way that her mind works (this is for all of you as well!) I can now try to be more understanding of her weaknesses, and more appreciative of her strengths. The biggest strength that comes to my mind is her ability to support me/make me feel supported like no one else can. I think it's great that she's able to always lift me up into a position I feel comfortable leading from.\n\nI appreciate her greatly, but I can't verbalize it very well; God forbid my mom ask "what do you like about her?" again. I'm not the very good at conceptualizing emotions in any way other than logically (I just posted on r/ISTP about this lol; it's a screenshot of our texts one day)
3	Dating an ISFP	Anyone have experience from dating ISFP? I'm interested in a isfp man and I'm curious to know how it has worked for others! :) So far my relationship with him has been amazing. 
4	I’ve been dating an ISFP male for a couple months now and here are my takeaways:\n\nPROS\n- we click really well and compliment each other. He is far more relaxed than I am and helps me chill out. I am organized and diligent and get help him get shit done. \n- I love how physically affectionate he is with me. It’s perfect \n- Great sense of humor \n- We mentally jive super well and are on the same level. He is very easy to be around \n\nCONS \n- he’s not as driven and ambitious as I am \n- Struggles with commitment and defining the relationship (which was really tough for me at first and I think something ISFJs find frustrating. We like to know what to expect). \n- Difficult to have serious conversations about us bc he doesn’t always “understand his feelings” \n- Generally a slow thinker and speaker. They like to mull things over for a while, whereas I tend to think fast and if I’m in a comfortable environment (such as with a partner) I’m a fast talker too. He struggles to keep up. \n
3	never dated, I'm still young tho. but ISFP's and ISFJ's really compliment each other. it's a good match nature-speaking.
1	I suspect I’m dating an ISFP. We’ve been together for about 6 months; there are ups and downs, and I’m not sure if it’s gonna work out long-term. I feel very comfortable with him and find him easy to get along and joke with, and we’re both very physically affectionate, which is nice. We tend to stay in when we hang out, but when we do get out of the house, we have a good time. \n\nHowever, he’s got a lot on his plate and much of it involves his close friends, so I tend to take a back seat 95% of the time and don’t see him very often. The time we spend together is usually really good, but he’s very passive, especially in letting friends and family rule his schedule, and hasn’t found an effective way of carving out time for me yet. It bothers me a lot due to my desire for consistent, attentive expressions of affection, so although I like and admire him very much as a person, I’m not sure it’s going to work out in a romantic sense. 
11	“Annoying” - What does this mean?	Hi! I’ve previously posted on this thread and yes, I’m still in the motions of moving on from her! Background: ENFP male confessed to ISFJ female and was rejected.\n\nShort update: She said “let’s be friends for now. I’m unsure if things will change in the future but yes, that for now”. Another redditor has pointed out (in a separate subreddit) she may be using me as a safety net.\n\n**Here’s the more important question**: We’re still texting daily however. I still treasure her as a friend so it is unlikely I’ll go completely cold on her. But a lot of the times, she would call me “Annoying” when I tease her about stuff. For example, I’d lightly tease her about her obvious grammar mistakes when we’re chatting and she’d say “annoying”. So, when she says that, does it mean she is truly annoyed, or that she’s just bantering?
28	I’d think she’s truly annoyed but trying to play it off because ISFJ’s typically don’t like to cause arguments 
16	she is truly annoyed at you. she would never say that unless she really means it.
15	As an ISFJ, I would be annoyed. I’d view it as being criticized or you embarrassing me. So, yes, I would mean it if I said it.
8	I am an ENFP with an ISFJ boyfriend, I pretty much try to refrain from any teasing or pointing out when hes made a mistake because it usually hurts his feelings, wether he voices it or not.\n\nThe first year or so in my mind, I would playfully "roast" him or poke fun at little things, and although he never said anything then he waay later confessed that it felt like I was making fun of him and that I was putting him down. \n\nNow if I have a comment I'll keep it to myself unless it's extremely obvious were both goofing around. \n\nSo yeah if shes literally telling you it's annoying you should probably stop lol. Us ENFP's tend to be a little too playful sometimes haha.

11	As a J type, do you feel almost as if you were a P type?	I'm wondering if anyone else feels like they are a P type rather than a J type at times.\n\nWhen I originally took the MBTI, I tested as P rather than J as I love new experiences (if I have time to research and prepare), new ideas (provided a good argument) and am very open minded (which I attribute to a strong Fe). \n\nI am in a family of J types, and they seem to fit to "J" box a lot more strongly than I do. Does anyone else, as an ISFJ, feel like they are fairly open minded relative to other J types?\n\nI feel ISFJs get stereotyped into liking their set routines and never deviating from them, but I don't feel that's exactly true for ISFJs.
11	Yeah, I agree. SJ’s typically get labeled as close minded. I’m not sure if that’s the case on a large scale, but I pride myself in being open minded and laid back. I am also pretty J though, in terms of liking things a certain way and being a planner/organized. 
6	You need to understand the functions.  Too much regard is given to four false dichotomies even when it makes no sense.
5	I agree so much. The very first line on 16personalities about ISFJ sort of addresses this, not just for J/P but for the other traits as well.\n\n>The ISFJ personality type is quite unique, as many of their qualities defy the definition of their individual traits. Though possessing the Feeling (F) trait, ISFJs have excellent analytical abilities; though Introverted (I), they have well-developed people skills and robust social relationships; and though they are a Judging (J) type, ISFJs are often receptive to change and new ideas. \n\nI do agree that a lot of the cliche stereotypes miss the mark. And think there's a lot more beneath the surface than most give us credit for.\n
5	i’ve flipped between ISFP and ISFJ for a while now. ISFJ seems to fit me the best I think though. I always thought it was really strange when I wasn’t very artistic at all when i thought i was an ISFP. 
3	Yep I am currently in a dilemma whether I'm an ISFP or ISFJ. I know the functions are different but I feel like I relate to both tbh.
2	I've known my ISFJ wife for close to 20 years.  I'm an INFP.  I wouldn't say she's close minded...she will question her beliefs and can change and adapt if she feels she should.  She also enjoys new experiences, especially when it comes to food/drink and vacations.  But she definitely loves set routines and this is probably where the close minded stereotype comes into play.   I'm more likely to say "what if we just try it this way to see what happens"  or if I'm not feeling something that day I might just throw my routine out the window.  She does not like that at all and will sometimes persist with routines even when they clearly aren't working that well.
3	I have flopped between J and P in different times of my life. I used to be very P but then a few years later I was slightly on the J side. Now I am a P again but not so extreme. Like 60% P, and this definitely fits me the best.\nIt's very interesting and I can see how different times in my life can make me switch between the two.
2	well i feel like I am open minded but that has nothing to do with it

4	INTP here. Looking for some advice on my relationship with my ISFJ girlfriend.	First thank you so much for the resources posted in the pinned post. I feel more confident that I am  a natural at showing my ISFJ love. :D \n\nHere is my situation.\n\nI am an INTP lesbian in a long distance relationship with an ISFJ highschool teacher. I love her so much. She is the smartest, most beautiful person I have ever met in my entire life. Did I mention she is the smartest, most beautiful person I have ever met in my entire life? Well, she is. She is the smartest, most beautiful person I have ever met in my entire life. 😍\n\nNeither of us is willing/able to move to be closer for reasons. The long distance is going to be how it is likely until we both retire. Say 13 years at least for me. I highly doubt she will ever give up teaching. Seems very unlikely, why would she?\n\nShe is VERY introverted, and behaves like described in the pinned resources. She caves in her home on the weekends. However, 2 people in her life pry her out of there, so she never gets enough cave time. She gives past where it hurts.\n\nAnd I get them, spending time with her is as close as you to can get to heaven while on earth.\n\nAnyway, we talk on the phone on our way to work on weekday mornings. Other than in person visits that's about all the contact I get. Once in a while she will answer the phone after work, but not usually. I can sometimes get her to respond to a text. Maybe one in 20 or 30. So once or twice a week unless she is sick, then oddly I get texts.\n\nHere is where my heart burn is:\n\nI don't get enough response from her for my needs. This is actually physically painful for me. Unfortunately I am an INTP with an 8w1 sx enneagram. It's very painful to not hear from her at all, all weekend. Not even a good night text. To make it worse, she knows and appologizes and tells me she isn't ignoring me, and she isn't. I'm sure she reads every text I send. She just rarely responds. \n\nMy assumption is that replying to my texts is not rewarding for her. Telling her I need more attention I think did more harm than good. It's true, but it added pressure.\n\nThe problem is clearly mine. How can I phrase a text that she will respond too?\n\nSome examples of texts I can get a response from:\n\nWhat are those fish oil pills you have called? I want to get some.\n\nWhy are 0 and 1 values in computer programing different than math?\n\nDo you remember the brand of socks we bought? Gosh, they are so soft, I want to buy more.\n\nMaybe the real issue is my 100% N and her S. Sigh 😔\n\nMaybe I can't get any more attention than I already do.\n
8	Honestly, knowing my personality type i think she responds to those texts because they are objective (easy to answer) and won't provide contention or strain on her or the relationship. \n\nBut I also find it odd that she won't reply to *any* texts, because with the people in my life who are close to me always get a reply because what if they needed something.\n\nMaybe an in person visit would be the best place to talk to her about this 
5	I have had a few long distance relationships and I will have to agree that it’s a bit odd for her not to reply to your texts, unless of course she is super busy or going through a rough time personally.   But then you mentioned that you talk(call) on weekdays on your way to work so I think that’s a good sign. Generally, I like constant communication with an SO but prefer calling over texting as I get to have more meaningful interactions through that. Maybe she is like that? I will refrain from theorizing any further why she doesn’t text as much as you want her to, but instead agree that it could be that you just have different needs when it comes to the level of attention in a relationship. By the way, how long have you two been dating?
6	 long distance relationships are objectively tough. I can't do them, but a dynamic of them is people can't respond immediately or be there for you more with than just words. You seem like you either need to understand she can't respond to you always when you need it, so work on becoming less emotionally dependant, or move closer to her. Finally the last and hardest solution is meet someone you can hang out with in real life, say that you can't do the long distance thing.\n\n\nIf hanging with her is heaven, maybe you should drop everything and move there, given it's heaven.
3	My ISFJ bf and I were long distance and we were constantly texting.\n\nFrom what I know high school teachers are never really off the clock except during summer. There's grading, lesson plans, and now they have to answer emails from students. As an introvert this sounds exhausting. She could be too busy and tired to text.
2	As many have commented, long distance relationship is a challenge. I’m an ISFJ myself, and just a personal preference, I’d rather spend my time talking on the phone for hours rather than texting. Maybe ask her if she prefers doing that too? Or maybe she’s busy? 
2	Thanks everyone for the advice. I feel like I have what I need to get this fixed up. I am just not sending the right words. You are awesome! Really appreciate the help. She is so worth it. 😍\n\nPS Rhetorical: That ENTP guy. What's he doing in here? LOL. If I wanted their advice I'd have gone to the ENTP subreddit. Sorry, I know you don't like  conflict, but seriously. The ego on them. It's amazing. I bet they play baseball a lot. Huh. I'm off to go research that now. 
1	Follow up: So it's going well I think. This group was very helpful in helping me focus on where I was going wrong.  She mentioned scheduling me in, and I mentioned that I'm worth 5 minutes of her time daily as she spends her time on important things. I am  important too, but not in a time sensative way. 2 1/2 minutes early in the day. 2 1/2 minutes later in the evening. I actually am wrestling with a lot of guilt about it, but I need that regular attention. Everyone else is getting more than that. I am also sticking to the short amount time that I asked for, and  I'm good with it. No idea if she is. She is too exhausted for me to tell, and the week off for the holidays can't come soon enough for her, and then it will get worse with her community theater company revving up to perform their production after the holidays.\n\nWe still keep our morning commute chat. Today she got hear me cuss out what I think was a drunk construction worker in a van after we nearly collided. It's good to see/hear people at their worst. Never thought that she might be the last person I ever talk too though.\n\nSo thanks a heap for your advice, it was super helpful. 
-1	The irony of the lack of response on this after 23 (very patient) minutes is not lost on me. I believe this is in fact my answer I was looking for.
13	ISFJs how do you feel about ENFPs?	I’m a ENFP and 2/4 of my best friends are ISFJs! They are both super sweet and caring and I know if I ever needed help they would do everything they could to help. They both are super smart and really hard workers (we are all in grade 12 and they are headed towards medical school and veterinary school respectively)\n\nIt took quite awhile for them to open up and they both tend to minimize their own problems and don’t like ‘burdening’ others with their issues even if the other person (me) wants to help them.\n\nI was just curious to see if any ISFJs had any ENFP friends and what it was like becoming friends with them and just thoughts about ENFPs in general.
4	I have a close friend that is ENFP. She's great! She's honest and tries to be direct about things with me, which I value greatly. We kind of watch each other's back. She's thinking 5 years down the road, and I'm thinking of what to do now to get there. She values that about me, because it can be tough for her to achieve big goals.\n\nIt's tough to let her help me, but I've learned to let it go. If I don't let her help, I'll feel like I'm giving too much. Feels good to have someone take some of the burden. She's also good with helping me realize the flip side of things.\n\nIt's a nice balance.
4	My brother-in-law is an ENFP. I like being around him, but I find him a little bit intimidating at times, even though he's younger than me. He's very good at inspiring me to do new things and try new hobbies. I think he's a mess and shake my head at him good-naturedly all the time, but I love him.
4	My cousin is an ENFP. She's pretty cool and I love her excitement and general optimism about life. I definitely feel like I can talk to her about some things I'm going for and she'll try to emphasize and help me. She also tends to be very honest with me about things which I apperciate. She always tries to make time for her cousins by reaching out and scheduling events. She also values family strongly in that she would do anything for them which I really respect in her.  However, we do have very different personalities that can sometimes create conflicts. Where she tends to be spontaneous, not careful, and loud I'm the opposite in that I'm more quiet and low key. Also sometimes she can over rely on her Te and become super blunt which I can find a bit pushy and desperate. I really apperciate when her Si comes out and I think she enjoys it when my Ne comes out. Overall, though she's one of my favorite cousins and I wouldn't trade her for the world.
4	my sister is an ENFP, and she's a good sis. although we fight sometimes, we always become friends again. we're close. 
3	I had an ENFP as a best friend for a while. Unfortunately, we just weren't compatible. We for sure have different priorities, and I couldn't deal with how much she jumped from one activity to the next. I didn't feel like I knew who she was. I felt like I was boring her every time we had a conversation because I dont explore as many new things as she did, I enjoy the routine. Ultimately she just drifted from me. We'd have lovely long in depth conversations when we managed to hit on the right topic, though. That was what I loved most about her. 
2	I don't have any friends who I've typed as ENFP's, but what I can say is that I have loved most of the healthy ENFP's I've met!  The only ENFP's I don't like sometimes are the "talk-nonstop" type, but even they're still charming in their own way!

6	ISFJs, how are you with ESTJs? I am marrying my soon-to-be husband next year after 8 years of what I would say has been a strong relationship. There isn’t too much to read on these personalities as a couple?	
3	ESTJ's and I always mesh well.  We don't often end up being close friends, but that's primarily because my "close friends' (as in my friend group,) have always consisted, mostly, of xSxP's.  I know a lot of people in the MBTI community dislike ESTJ's, but I always work well with them - I understand their intentions and what they want to happen, so I try to follow-through as best as I can.  ESTJ's never really intimidate me, they seem to understand how to deal with me and I appreciate that.
3	Not a romantic relationship, but one of my friends is an ESTJ! He is really light-hearted and funny. I have a great time with him. I am really open with him because he doesn't take advice or criticism the wrong way. I appreciate how direct and honest he is. He has taught me a lot about football, shaped the music I listen to, and helped me expand my social circle. He's changed *a lot* since I first met him. At first he was awkward, but now he is popular and has tons of friends. He is constantly up-to-date with what his friends are doing and often talks to me about them. He has done many kind things for me, like reminding me when homework is due, inviting me to parties, helping me plan out projects, helping me carry stuff, helping me be healthier, sending me memes, and keeping me up with the tea. He is super aware of everyone's physical location. It's mind-blowing and I don't understand how he does it. We can be talking on the bus when he suddenly blurts out, "Hey, look inside of that car! It's Bob from my English class." He points out random stuff all of the time and has a really good eye for what's going on. When we are walking down the halls and he remembers everybody's name and says hi to them. He is also good at remembering time and wears a smartwatch everyday. He'll say, "The bus came to school two minutes earlier today" or "I saw your Snapchat streak and we went to sleep at the exact same time, 11:24!" He has a really bad memory for conversations, forgetting what we talked about a couple of hours ago and constantly telling me the same story twice. I don't mind though because I'm really interested in his stories. I wish he would talk to me more about his feelings. He doesn't comprehend when I get a mood swing and go from being happy to sad. He mostly stays in a single mood throughout the entire day. It'd also be cool if he knew what he wanted. The stereotypical ESTJ is a leader and knows exactly what they want. But whenever I ask him, "What do you want to do right now?" or "Where do you want to go?" he has no clue, so it's up to me to come up with something. Other than that, we're good friends and I really appreciate him and everything he has done for me. 
2	I largely only associate with SFPs.
7	What are the types of your parents?	My parents are: Dad (ISTP,) and Mom (INFx - I think she has Ni over Ne, but I can't decide whether she's Fi/Te or Fe/Ti.)
5	ESTJ and an untyped. They split a long time ago so that might've factored. 
2	my dad is an INFJ, my mom is an ESFJ...probably 
2	[deleted]
2	ESFJ mom and ENFP (?) dad. They produced two very introverted kids (ISFJ me and INTP brother).
2	Is there a way of knowing without them having to take the test?
2	ISTJ dad and ENFP mom. They have an interesting dynamic.
1	ENTJ dad and mom is unknown, just know that she's an I. 
7	ISFJs How are your Interactions with INTPs?	I suprisingly get on well with INTPs. I have a couple of friends that are INTPs. They are also pretty loyal in my experience to their friends. Not to say all of my interactions with them are great they can be really blunt at times but I think it comes from good place and they are just trying to be honest. I also really admire their strong Ti analytical abilities. I definitely feel like my tertiary Ti and even Ne come out more around them. I also feel like they appreciate my Si and Fe. Overall, I find that when healthy both of us can appreciate the others strengths as those are our weaknesses. So any ISFJs have experiences with INTPs? 
9	My S/O is an INTP, we have been together over 10 years! I love him because he is so spontaneously funny.. he could be a unique comedian if he wanted to be. He makes me laugh every day. I could never come up with the stuff he does. He has some communication issues but as he is working on that, things get better. The thing is our perspective can differ a lot so unless we talk about it, it’s hard to know how the other person really feels. So he can come across as rude sometimes, and also projects his feelings into me a lot. But he is very sweet and loyal and I feel very lucky to live with such a unique guy like him! 
3	I feel this all the time with my fellow INTP friends. Spot on. 
2	I don't think I have any friends who I've typed as an INTP, which is sad, because I actually really want to meet an INTP!  xNTP's, generally speaking, interest/fascinate me because their behavior is very different from mine, but we have a very similar thought process (I've always noticed this when watching films with xNTP fictional characters,) and so even when I disagree with their actions, I *understand* why they're doing what they're doing.  I have a love for what I think of as "INTP humor" (Daria, Aubrey Plaza sort of thing.) I know it's the whole same-functions thing, but it actually fascinates me just what I've noticed I have in common with xNTP's on the Internet and through media, even though a lot of xNTP's seem to dislike ISFJ's.
2	I  am an ISFJ and by SO is an INTP and we have been together nearly 5 years. I love him.  We compliment each other so well. 
1	I don't have many friends, don't have any INTP friends. But I can agree with you, I think so too. !!
1	That's how I feel about ISFJ myself. My Si is definitely helped a lot. My Fe too, but it's not as dramatic as it's already became pretty strong by itself.\n\nI guess sharing introversion makes that easier. 
1	All my boyfriends have been intps 
1	I really admire and like hanging out with them cos they’re probably one of the very few people that can handle my sarcasm lol and they like arguing which stimulates my Ti 
12	if you were to describe yourself like a character in a book, how would it be?	
12	That very skinny girl with big brown eyes and long dark hair with an incredibly deceiving first impression. At first she appears mute, until you gain her trust, then the floodgates open and she won't shut up. Despite her thin frame and harmless demeanor, if you are being threatened, she will protect you. The vibes are strong with this one. No one will touch you. 
11	that guy over there in black hoodie and blue jeans, dark brown hair, black and red glasses, and a reserved and quiet vibe to him. He always has his Earbuds in listening to music, sometimes tapping along to a beat, rather than socializing. 
6	That weird quiet girl with brown curly hair and a sad smile who usually only speaks when spoken to. She'd be pretty forgettable if it weren't for her odd name. 
3	I would be the whole J.R.R.Tolkien Middle Earth, universe.  That’s me!  Get it...  not just a character.  But everything!  
3	Complicated. Lol. That's the best way for me to put it. What about you, OP?
2	Ooh ooh can I join? I would be the witch that lives in a house in the swamp, that people seek out for advice. I wear a green dress and flower garlands, and look like any fair maiden (not the mother or the crone kind of witch). ✌️
2	In the front of a crowded room, she sits quietly. Her expression is like that of still water, eagerly waiting to capture your reflection. You do not notice her in the commotion, like the eye of a hiker on a trek through a lively wood. You stop at a clearing and see a deer walk out of the beautiful fall foliage in front of you. She bows her head, and you think she is addressing you. But then, the deer laps water from a small pond, a beautifully curled leaf flirting with her flickering ear. Your gaze follows the doe, and then, in the sunlight peeking through the foliage, you see the still waters.
4	Does anyone know a discord geared towards sensing or feeling types?	I’m curious what that would be like! I feel like I don’t fit into a lot of the mbti discords since it’s mostly nt conversation that dominates. \n\n\n\nAnd it’s like, I get to read about how people low key hate SJs all the time, and it starts to make me feel bad about being there. \n\n\nAnyway, I thought it was worth a shot to ask if this exists already. 
3	There aren't any I've found but if you find one you should definitely share it with the rest of us! Maybe we'll need to make one ourselves 🤧
3	don't think so..  unfortunately.
4	Tipsy Typology Discord	Attention all ISFJ, Typology is in great danger, and it needs YOUR help to wipe out all the other typology mistypes. To do this, it needs amazing typologists and a couple of psychology nerds. To help it, all it needs is your intellect, creativity and acceptance to Tipsy Typology. But you gotta be quick so that Typology can secure and achieve the typing session we all deserve.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/uk38YUD
5	I made a subreddit for MBTI enthusiasts who make music. Please come and share your OC!	/r/MBTImusicians\n\n7 different people have already posted songs they've made. You should, too! :)
1	Feel free to check mine out, especially if you live in a different country. It shows different country's flags under my profile's stats and I am measuring my success based on how many flags I can collect :) Sort of like collecting Pokemon :P\n\n* [INTP [Classical](1:00)](https://soundcloud.com/user-216205579/track-1)
11	Would ISFJ's make good villians? What are some good fictional/non fictional villains?	 I'll  wonder how our personality type will be if we went down a dark path. Since our type is named the "defender", I could only imagined us doing some "interesting" things if we decided to not be defenders anymore. \n
12	I think manipulation is how ISFJ-ness could be used for evil. We're always observing and thinking ahead about how to bring ease and comfort to those we encounter. But that also means we have a next-level awareness about the various dynamics going on. There's a subtle evil that could be switched-on if our motivations were different. And nobody would suspect a thing because of how we blend into the background :). \n\nThough the very thought of the resulting conflict would probably stop us from getting too far. 
5	I could see us being interesting as villains who *are* defenders, honestly. Wouldn’t it be a good villain, someone who becomes so twisted in their view of what they must do to protect certain people or even ideals that they’ll do something horrific without even blinking? I like that kind of villain. 
3	I always thought if I was a villain, I’d be a petty bureaucrat. I’d probably prevent the heroes from getting permits by being a stickler and that would force their hand into something illegal and dramatic. Then I would tell on them. \n\nOr I’d spread rumors about them under the guise of helpfully warning other people to take care of themselves. 
6	Probably the villian would be that sickeningly sweet professor from Harry Potter who pretends to be nice and wants order but secretly hates anyone who defies her\n\nEdit:Found her\n\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/d/d2/Dolores_umbridge2.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/215?cb=20161120214852
2	The ultimate governor in Danganronpa V3 could be seen as an isfj "villain"
2	What about Fisk from the Daredevil show? Is it possible Fisk can be a ISFJ?
2	Apparently Norman Bates was labelled as an ISFJ. I can see that one.\n\nSome folks also called Narcissa Malfoy and Peter Pettigrew from Harry Potter Isfjs. Peter is a bit iffy for me... he completely back stabbed his best friend for some dark lord. It's possible that's associated with inferior Ne than anything else, but still strange. Narcissa Malfoy makes sense to me. Also I like how she was one of the causes of Voldemort's downfall, and he's an INTJ.\n\nTBH, I can picture an ISFJ villain as very covert. And the motive being protection of someone close to them. Maybe a police officer, someone who has in-depth knowledge of police protocol, trying to protect a spouse who committed a murder. \n\n
1	It’s not a secret she hates them 
1	Interesting is the last word I'd use to describe you guys. You need to learn to have initiative, to converse, and to be a little meaner. \n\nIs this a compliment? 🤷🏼‍♀️
13	Anyone here a business owner or in a managerial role?	If you are, how does being an ISFJ affect the way you work and supervise employees? \n\nI think i'm a true ISFJ, except for the fact that I want to be a business owner. I'm currently a manager of a restaurant that I would like to someday own. In the past, I've been an Administrative Assistant, and I did not like doing things for other people or being told what to do.  However, I also feel uncomfortable delegating tasks or telling others what to do.  \n\nYou may wonder, how do I do my job right as a Manager if i'm an ISFJ? \n\nI've been a manager for over a year now and I'm actually very proud of myself for being able to delegate tasks to my employees. It does make me uncomfortable because I have that mindset of "If I want it done right, I better do it myself". However, I know that these people are getting paid to work and this is their job to clean, work, etc...  I have to put on that "Manager cap" and that "I shouldn't care what others think of me" mentality.  \n\nSometimes I feel that I am too considerate of my employees because my closers have alot to clean already and I feel that if I ask them to clean a few more things, that I may be overworking them.  So I dont even bother to add certain things to their closing list and just have the morning/midshift employees do it instead.  \n\nAlso, i'm not sure if this is an ISFJ trait or not, but I feel so bad whenever I get a feeling that someone doesn't like me! Of course I understand the fact that not everyone will like me, but I can't help but feel that way!
5	I was a manager ( still have manager in my title).   My main strength was in helping people, either directly or indirectly (delegation of someone to the task to help out).  I also ended up doing more mentoring .   I was process creation driven as well. \nDelegation helped get around the i part as well, in that if it was dealing with an e team, I could send my closest to e type  out 
5	I was the project manager on my final engineering design project in college. It was a team of 5-6 of us. I took it on as a year-long role. I was good at keeping organized and making sure everyone had a task to work on. I was happy to be the kind of leader with a positive and encouraging attitude, but I found it tricky to let others do the detailed work and stay at a high-level. I really didn’t want to make my teammates feel like they were doing more work than me, although I had extra duties managing the project. I think I would find this easier at a job with a more obvious hierarchy. But I’m sure I would still struggle with imposter syndrome and guilt for not “working as hard” to get whatever more I was paid. But that’s also the nature of being a woman in a technical field.. I wonder if it is common for other ISFJs struggle with imposter syndrome as well.
4	I am about to become a manager of my department and I’m definitely worried about letting people down or not being able to delegate properly since I have a tendency to take on too many things at once due to the mindset you mentioned. I want to step up and help my team but I’m nervous about it for sure. 
2	Office Manager Here - former administrative assistant...I report only to the owner who takes my input seriously. I know it wouldn't work if I had more people to report to and less flexibility. I can work from home. I do have to answer the phone which I don't love but *shrugs* necessary evil. I do share the same sentiment about doing the work best by myself...BUT with empathy and patience I've hired people who do their jobs well...this helps. \n\n
2	I speak only from my limited knowledge of falling into the ISFJ category as well as long experience of QSR management, so take what you will from it.\n\nI don't believe we are natural leaders, but we are natural managers due to our high compentency, attention to detail and observational skill. As such, we often find ourselves gravitating towards those positions even though we may not actually see ourselves as 'managers' or meet our own critera for what a 'manager' should be.\n\nI believe it takes a long time to learn and adjust at this level because its more personality and character based rather than anything theoretical; however, once you're over the hurdle (you said you've been manager for only over a year) - and it could take anywhere from 2-10 years to get this down - the rest is plain sailing ahead. I am certain that other more extroverted personalities adjust far quicker but from my observation they reach a ceiling much sooner that they are less likely to break through.\n\nYour soft people skills will completely detract from anyone not liking you - so you should ignore that erroneous thought - as employees and teams will generally respect the organisation, composure and integrity that you bring to any given situation.\n\nYou need only focus on your own mindset:\n\n1. You say if you want it done right, you better do it yourself. If you want management done right, you better do what you are paid to do, otherwise you are just a very expensive team member and ignoring your responsibilities. When you fall into that trap; ask yourself: Am I being paid to do this? What should I be doing instead?\n\n2. Within the confines of your personality, you are probably supportive. You may think your position as the Manager doesn't synergise with this trait; perhaps you think you'd function better as a Deputy or Assistant Manager. Wrong: Think of yourself as supporting the Area/District Manager in your capacity as Store Manager and you will feel better about your role and function.\n\n3. Choosing a Deputy/Assistant Manager. Develop someone who has your aptitude and attention to detail, but not your personality. You need someone that complements you, perhaps a more extroverted/energetic personality. In a restaurant or other 'busy environment', an ISFJ needs a strong partner(s) and needs to create equals. Other types do not need this, but in my experience, we do or we are prone to burn out.
1	When delegating, I look for those whose strengths align with the task. I make sure to explain why I am delegating this to them specifically. \n\nThe other issue sounds like you’re concerned with the fairness aspect. Have you looked into listing everything out and having a list of open/mid/close duties? Then let those on each shift decide who does what amongst themselves? Just a thought! 
30	Are ISFJs invisible?	We aren’t a rare personality. Still, I have observed we are one of the most ignored. Just compare the size of this subreddit with the INFJ’s. I understand if other personalities don’t find us interesting enough to talk about but I feel not many ISFJs are enthusiastic about being one. Is it part of the personality itself, to not give too much importance to this kind of thing? (If I come across as generalizing, that’s not my intention, it’s just something that’s been in my mind lately).\n\nEdit:\n\nI just checked, we are the most common one, and infj is the least common. Something seems off to me...\n\nhttps://www.careerplanner.com/MB2/TypeInPopulation.cfm
39	Most ISFJs type themselves as INFJ because low quality mbti descriptions depict the difference as being an insightful person who likes systems like the mbti (N) and a milquetoast who should be baking pies or scrap booking for their family (S). \n\n I do have to say though- I think a lot of ISFJs including myself /are/ kind of boring- and it’s the way we want ourselves to be perceived and go about our lives. We don’t want to rock the boat unless it’s totally necessary. We don’t want to rant about our hobbies unless we know the other party is interested. We are always measuring the group dynamics to ensure harmony and practical solutions to problems. When there’s drama and uncertainty, we tend to beat a hasty retreat if we can. We have an inner life of interesting impressions, personal drama, theories, even whimsy- but it’s locked down for the most part. Leaks in small drops, or in close confidence. \n\nI went through a lot of descriptions of ISFJ characters in media recently- looking for a role model. I found: ISFJ characters are rarely main characters- mostly side characters who help or serve as foils for main characters. Neville Longbottom- honor his hard work, loyalty, and sacrifice! Harry Potter’s impulsivity, reckless curiosity, and disagreeableness are a lot more interesting. That’s why he’s the main character. Not necessarily better- but definitely more fun to read about. \n\nAll that rambling is to say: yes, lots of ISFJs are mostly boring unless you’re the sort who’s interested in prying their secret, inner life from them. And then only if they let you in. \n\n\nEdit: [look at this sorry cast](https://i-h1.pinimg.com/736x/d3/ba/e1/d3bae19bd713e3614a265413194ccc30.jpg) \n\nWatson’s pretty great, but only because he serves as human consultant for Sherlock Holmes. \n\n\nIf anyone can point me to an ISFJ protagonist who is interesting(not just self effacing and good what what they do) please let me know.\n
23	Most ISFJs don’t like to draw attention to themselves. And what they said ^
20	I wonder if ISFJs are more lurkers than anything and that's why there aren't more of us contributing to this sub compared to other types. Personally, I mostly use the internet to research and read about things I enjoy. I'm not really that good at expressing myself through social media and internet forums. And I guess that's kind of the way I am in person too, present and involved but not necessarily outspoken. That seems to make us easy to take for granted.
17	I'm not convinced that those percentages are all that accurate. Who's coming up with these numbers? And \*how\* are they getting them?\n\nAnyway, when I was first getting into MBTI, I initially typed myself as INFJ. But the more I read about other introverted types, the more I identified with ISFJ.\n\nPlus, INFJs have a complex of self-importance that really agitates me. A lot of them have this air of being special and too "deep" and "complex" to be understood.
16	I wish this was a more active subreddit. Why aren't people more jazzed about Si? \n\nMy guess is that people are uncomfortable with being an ISFJ and therefore common and so type as INFJ to be rare and special. I think this happens especially if the person initially feels like they are IXFJ.\n\nAlso, the internet hates us for some reason, and thinks we're pretty much only good for boring tasks because of our attention to detail, or sees us as overbearing mothers or grandmothers. So, it's really uncomfortable being hated on lol and maybe just easier to keep silent.\n\nWe really need better role models and to hear from more ISFJs.
16	well I am an EFNP, I married an ISFJ and there are some awesome gifts that you guys get.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSi, introverted Sensing, this is where you have gifts to be attentive to details. Data analyzing, editing, are just a few things to name off that you excel at.\n\nalso, you are very detailed in being well prepared for almost everything you do. It amazes me how much my wife will research a job and all the things she has to look up just in case it might be needed.\n\nYou also are great at experiencing things, like taste, my wife will stop my conversations just to say "hold on I want to focus on how good this pasta taste". That just blew my mind away because even when I am eating something tasty, I am still brainstorming and putting together theories in my head. \n\nThe other thing about being a master of Si, is that you can preemptively, experience things.  You can sense danger faster than anyone but also you can experience happiness, joy, and excitement before anyone.\n\nFor example, my wife wanted to stand in a line that was crazy long for a haunted house, and I was so turned off by the idea because of it. I asked, how can you deal with such a long line? She explained that she already starts feeling the excitement of the haunted house while she is waiting. That again, just blew my mind away, what a cool gift to experience excitement before the event actually happens?\n\nSo being patient comes easy for you which is so hard for Ns. They are always so future focused that patience in the present moment is very hard indeed to comprehend. \n\nNot to mention your attention to detail carries over to your memory. You can have almost a photographic memory at times. \n\nThe reason why you also want so many details of what is to happen is because you are so used to comparing every present moment with the past, that you need details to compare the present moment to. Even if that means you have to google everything and read twenty books, etc.\n\nYour gifts for extroverted feeling, aka harmony, are amazing too. My wife loves to make sure I am having fun, and that I am happy, and she will not feel happy until I am.\n\nThe other thing that I love about ISFJs, is that their Ti, introverted thinking, is what they like to do for fun.  Introverted thinking is basically engaging in learning new truths. How cool is that? That you like to learn truth for fun? My wife loves to read self improvement books and has so much knowledge to connect with me on working on myself. \n\nI love my wife and I love ISFJs, especially getting to know their gifts. I think the Si mastery you guys have is amazing! Do not let any ego stompers in the MBTI community tear you down because if they really understood Si, they would think twice. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
5	I would say I’m probably ISFJ but have been mistyped as INFJ every time I’ve done a test. I relate to the cognitive functions of ISFJ more. \n\nI wouldn’t say I was boring, not really deep down, but on the surface I keep things so much to my chest that people don’t really see what’s going on underneath. I look like I have it all together but I don’t really! \n\nThat being said with people I know well I can be really fun, I have a great sense of humour when it comes out, and gosh I relate to being able to give the most thoughtful gifts! I just find social situations a bit overwhelming and tiring work! \n\n
7	No, although without properly setting boundaries like I'm pretty sure immature xxFJs may be prone to do I think that we can find ourselves overextending well beyond what we should which may lead to feeling ignored or underappreciated.\n\nI promise you this: without the relationship I had to an ISFJ woman I would've struggled a lot more in learning to love myself and I'm grateful every day for what we once had!\n\nNot to mention that most Sensing Doms aren't usually too interested in abstract and theoretical concepts if they don't find a practical reason for it which may be why some of xSxx reddits/forums have a smaller population.
1	Isfj male / female. I think this says enough.
1	You are welcome! Oh and I found a new observation on Si, they collect detailed data of the present moment of every object or person, the sensory data, how it tastes, what it looks like, what sounds are in the air, what it feels like, and as they collect that data it passes through their body to have an intense present moment. This is also why they want to be so prepared because they want to make sure they can keep that experience continuous. \nWhen we go hiking, I just want to bring my coat and I am good but my wife will bring a backpack with water bottles, snacks, and extra warmth clothes. \nSi also loves daily routines, which is a great tool to accomplish goals.\nAs INFP, you have Si as number 3, which means you love to use Si for fun, relief. You might enjoy being outside or just reflecting on the past, or find yourself developing daily routines on your own accord.\nJK Rowling is INFP, her Fi as number one helps her characters come to life with detailed feelings and also incredible will power and resilience to follow through on her story, Ne to brain storm and be creative about her mythology, Si to help encourage her daily tasks to write and also the ability to write the sensory data in her descriptions to make you feel like you were there.
24	Are you able to talk about yourself to someone? If you do, do you enjoy it?	I tend to be really disgusted with the thought of talking about myself. I don’t like to boast about my accomplishments, because I feel like I’ll be coming off as narcissistic and trying to compete with another person. I like to hear what others are thinking and how their days are more often than discussing my own. I just want to listen rather than talk about myself. It’s hard for me to even think about what I think about myself. I think It’s just something I have to work on getting comfortable with, but I don’t feel comfortable expressing who I am in this world. 
17	I actually like talking about myself but only if I know the person is for sure going to be interested or already knows about the topic\n\nIts a way to connect with people and if sharing things with someone and trying to talk about something new to them theyre clearly going to be uninterested in or even obviously dislike I dont see the point. Dont want to start any convos that would lead to a topic they wont care about
4	I used to be very shy and wouldn’t open up at all as a teenager. Then when I was around 17 or 18 I realized I really enjoy talking about myself to others if they are interested. I realized I have nothing to hide, and I will answer just about any question about myself truthfully. My thing is, I won’t boast about my accomplishments unless it’s to a friend that boasts about theirs as well. For example I never talk about my relationship to my coworkers because I don’t want to make them feel bad since they don’t have that experience. But there is one coworker who opens up to me about her relationship, so I feel comfortable opening up to her about mine as well. I enjoy that kind of bonding a lot, but only if it goes both ways.
5	>It’s hard for me to even think about what I think about myself.\n\nI couldn't have said it better myself. Sharing trivial thoughts/things about myself is no big deal but truly opening up feels impossible. Sometimes a few things unconsciously slip out when I'm with close friends (which is a good thing) but once I realize what's happening, I tend to feel anxious and uncomfortable. Not sure if this will help, but maybe try writing in a journal? I've tried doing it myself but lost motivation haha. Self-reflection is a good thing but for ISFJ's, I think we need to be careful not to "fall too far" into that type of mentality.
3	I feel very much like you most of the time. I do enjoy doing a lot of stuff but I can't help but feel that I would come off as a "show off" if I talked too much about myself. I only usually do it if it's related to something the other person mentions or if it can be helpful to them. I think that as long as it doesn't affect your state of mind, that should be ok, right?
3	IDK.. I am mostly uncomfortable doing so. It depends on my comfort level and closeness to the person I am talking to..  
1	Hmm, not really.  I don't know honestly.  Good question though. 
1	I like to talk about myself sometimes, to my family. but to friends and such? no. only my closest family. 
5	ISFJ [F] giving complicated signals, and refused to share details	Hi everyone! I’ve been browsing through this subreddit for a bit because currently I’m an ENFP male pursuing an ISFJ female. I have to say a lot of the information I have read seems to be accurate. However, I’ve now come to a roadblock.\n\nTL;DR at the bottom should anyone wants to skip the short description.\n\nWe have known each other for about 3 months now, we text everyday. I’ve previously confessed to her already, but she has mentioned she doesn’t feel comfortable yet and wishes to know each other as friends first, before moving on. Also, she has mentioned she doesnt feel comfortable going out with me 1-on-1 especially since she is really lazy to go out. She is only comfortable with meeting with me 1 on 1 for meals or studying (and it’s winter break now so, I can’t exactly ask her out to study). Just recently, she has refused to allow me to follow her private Instagram account (even went as far as to change the username after telling me the initial username), and refused to disclose the location of her new part-time job (I had suggested going there to see her). As far as I have read, this should mean she’s still fairly uncomfortable telling me stuff? \n\nTL;DR\nENFP male chasing ISFJ female. She texts me everyday and refused to allow me to follow her private instagram account. She also found a new part-time job and didnt want to tell me where it is. Is she still uncomfortable? \n\nPS: And also, while we were *both* messing around on her Tinder profile, on her phone, I noticed notifications (text) from 2 other different guys. \n\nQuestion: does her texting me everyday mean anything at all, considering she could be texting 2 other dudes on a daily basis anyway. Is her refusing to share details a sign she’s uncomfortable? And how do I proceed from here?\n
14	Sounds like she's interested in other people, I'd move on and try find someone new. Harsh to say, but it doesn't sound like she's that into you
8	> Question: does her texting me everyday mean anything at all, considering she could be texting 2 other dudes on a daily basis anyway. Is her refusing to share details a sign she’s uncomfortable? And how do I proceed from here?\n\nWe are very private people, so not sharing details with someone she doesn't know very well doesn't have to mean anything.. And I would not keep talking to someone I was not interested in.. But that might be just me. 
3	Very strange. Like someone else mentioned above, it sounds like she’s not that interested. While ISFJs are generally private, what you described sounds suspicious. I would move on.
2	she sounds like she's dating around & interested in other guys. If she was head over heels for you she'd let you into her instagram and block other guys tinder messages
1	she doesn't sound very interested. 
13	What is your reason for keeping people at arms length? Do you do the same thing with your partner?	I'm just curious if this is normal with our personality type. 
28	I'm not sure why I keep people at arms length. I never get too close or attached because I feel like these friends have even closer friends  or maybe they won't value our relationship as much as I do. \n\nI always noticed how i dont have a "best friend". The only person who knows the worst and best of me is my boyfriend. I dont hold anything back from him.
13	I have different reasons, depending on the person and circumstances.\n\nIf I don't know them very well, or they're just distant friends, it's just because I don't know that I can trust them fully, and it takes me a lot of time to fully open up to people.\n\n\nI definitely think I keep most people in my life at an arm's-length. The only exceptions to that would be my identical twin, my best friend and my boyfriend. I've known my best friend since I was 10 years old, and my twin has obviously been there since day 1, so I don't remember having walls up with them.\n\n\nWith my boyfriend though, it took some time. It took probably close to a year before my walls were really coming down, and now, a little over 2 years in, I feel like I can trust him fully and be open with him about anything. I will say that there are some parts of me that I may never share with another person, and I may always be somewhat private, but if anybody knows me, it's him. He's shown that he's a genuinely kind person, and he really cares about me, which was the biggest factor in letting my walls down. He probably knows me better than anyone else in my life at this point. 
10	It takes a lot of work to open up on a deep emotional level to someone else and quite frankly it's exhausting. 
5	I do this. I don't know if it's self preservation or what?... It takes a long time for my walls to come down. Once they do, I know I shock people around me lol 
3	I have been abandoned by people who were very dear to me, those I would do almost anything for. I will never get used to the pain of abandonment after I have given everything into the friendship or relationship, which is why I am careful not to get too close to anyone anymore. I let them in a little but never to the point that I will be broken beyond repair when they ditch me.
3	I don't trust easily because of people I thought were my friends were not there when I needed them the most. I'm friendly to people for the most part, but most of the time it's only a select few that I can feel comfortable opening up to. 
2	I definitely do this! I feel it is because I’m so future oriented & tend to think about all the “what ifs” for example I often debate someone’s true intentions or I wonder how a new relationship will affect me later on in life whether it be 6 months or 5 years. \n\nI don’t particularly like this trait but I do it to protect myself. I’m so sensitive & care about people deeply. I don’t want to put myself in a bad position in the long run. 
2	I feel insecure about many things and it makes me not want to get close to others. And I feel like by keeping people at arm's length (by being really polite+quiet+not initiating anything) I won't have to deal with negative things like criticism and embarrassment. Also, I get really pessimistic about interpersonal relationships and there's some part of me that believes that if a person was actually right for me, they would just somehow make it work. I know that's kinda dumb, but I know that deep down it's a part of my logic.
2	(ISxJ F)\n\nI keep a lot of people at arm's length partly because it takes so darn long to explain certain things about myself. I only tell a select few my life's story and after that interaction with that person becomes a lot simpler.\n\nAnother reason is because I'm kind of an all or nothing person. Either we're going to be best buddies or just acquaintances.\n\nAnd, no, I don't keep my husband at arm's length. That would be a bad idea for spouses in general.
7	What to get my ISFJ Wife.	O.k. Ladies.  Tell me what every ISFJ woman (mother)  wants or needs!
27	I certainly can’t claim to speak for every ISFJ woman. However, I don’t really like clutter and having extra “things”. I much prefer an experience to a physical gift. For example, my husband and decided to do a date night to a special restaurant as our gifts to each other this year.\n\nNot sure if this would be your wife’s sort of thing at all, but it’s an idea! 
16	I'll speak for myself, what I'd want from my husband? :)\n\nI want you! Your silent presence, a hug and a kiss and quality time with me. If it was possible, a long hug for 24 hours!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther than that, take care of yourself. You'll stress an ISFJ out if you (our beloved) don't take care of yourself. (we love taking care of others, but still, we can only do so much, it ultimately depends on how an individual looks after themselves, in my experience, as the saying goes - *You can lead a horse to the pond, but cannot force water down it's throat*). Have a sense of responsibility to your 'home' and yourself. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat's your type??
14	Something that she mentioned 2 years ago that she never got but you should still remember. This will show her that you care enough to listen well ;) 
10	I’m very practical. I like things I use more than things to look at. Things for the kitchen, my hobbies, or to make my life as a mom easier. (A roomba! But some women would be really bothered to get a cleaning tool as a gift, so fair warning) 
4	Let me suggest bath bombs, a massage with ambient sounds/music, a kiss on the neck, tons of cuddles, a quality book, an experience you can share together outside, clothes.
4	It would be best if you knew her love language! But i think something sentimental and meaningful would work for us, something that shows that you were really listening and observing. Thoughtfulness is the most precious gift
3	I think you know your wife best :) can you give more insight as to whether she is more into material goods or experiences? Agreed with the posts here, experiences > material goods but maybe we're all just weird ISFJs. 
3	a vacation, go to a bed & breakfast!
3	It's been said by others - something practical. Or a dinner (or a weekend trip) without kids. As an example - our dehumidifier broke down a few weeks ago - so what did I want or my birthday? A new one! :) If he had rather given me a perfume or a necklace I would have been disappointed...  \n\nThis being said: my [love language](https://www.5lovelanguages.com/) is not gifts.. (As you can probably guess...) \n\nEDIT: Ah.. just realized it's your mother.. So a romantic weekend away is out of the question.. haha. But a dinner or something practical is still an option. 
3	I’ll speak for myself as an ISFJ man. I’m not interested in getting material gifts unless it’s something expensive that I’ve been wanting to get for myself but don’t have the money to do so. But mostly we just want quality time with our partners so a surprise adventure somewhere that she’s been wanting to go to might be a good idea. Also if you’re looking for a cheaper option, maybe giving her “coupons” for a personal spa treatment from you I think will make her happy specially after those long days. 
2	Anything you put a lot of thought into
2	I really like it when my bf learns guitar to music i  like or when he watches tv shows i love or when he does something that he normally wouldn’t do\n\nOr candles 
1	Something sentimental. We are a sucker for things like that. We are also super nostalgic. \n\nGet us something special that made you think of us. Or something that reminds me of a special time in the past. Or something that symbolizes your  relationship with her and how much she means to you. 
10	hello fellow Defenders, how are you guys doing right now, really?	
19	Don't know.  Just going with the flow. 
12	[deleted]
11	I think the replies may be the most relatable thing I have read in this sub lol
11	Gradually making my way through nursing school. Hanging in there, I guess. 
6	On my fourth cup of coffee and LIVING
4	The Hand are up to their shenanigans again, so a little bit peeved
4	Meh, feel like shit but nothing new really. How r u doing OP?
5	i don’t like to be pessimistic or dramatic, but i haven’t been feeling myself lately. i’ve been having a bit of an identity crisis. i’m not sure who i am or what my purpose is. that’s why i’m on this subreddit. i feel like my friends don’t really understand me or know me that well. i’ve been feeling envious of my friends and it’s horrible, because i love them so much. the very least i would want is to be a bad, jealous friend to them. i’ve been losing sleep, feeling lonely, and overthinking little things. hopefully this is all just a stage and will pass soon.
3	Tired but content. Just planning all the next things in my head (get-togethers and holiday travel). 
3	Content. Really just going with the flow though. 
2	Stressed. Broke. But so happy in my relationship!! 
2	I'm doing alright I think.. IDK TBH.. how are you OP?
2	I'm okay. Kind of worried, kind of dealing with things. But I'm alright in this moment. 
1	Just getting through my last year in college
20	What methods do you use to calm down?	Specifically, when going for new things. Recently I’ve found that I get very nervous to the point where I’m almost sick to my stomach when I’m anticipating newness. Whether it’s going to a new place, applying/interviewing for a new job position, or having a new experience in general. Overthinking is a problem for me. Unfortunately, there have been many missed opportunities because of this and I’m wondering, do you all experience this as well? And what do you do to get yourself out of it? 
10	I don't know about others, but I've always fallen on music to calm me down. Talking to others helps me too. 
10	Cleaning helps me to calm down when I’m feeling anxious or overwhelmed. It’s harder for me to deal with things when things are a mess so I start cleaning, sometimes without even realizing I’m doing it. 
6	I will overthink like you mention to the point of discomfort in my stomach, head or body. Then I do as I have always and think my way out of it. Usually I throw the risk of not doing x or if I don’t achieve x is it really that bad? Or there are more chances later. But if it’s a one in an lifetime and I kick the can too far I have a resentment moment and try to get that back.
6	Weed, as well as hugs and words of reaffirmation from my SO
3	I try to stick to a routine in spite of the new experience. Same bedtime and wake up time, workout time, mealtimes, and messaging family & friends about how life is going. 
3	I do the same. I get that twisty feeling in my gut and have trouble relaxing. One thing that has helped me is having my one “person” I can talk to without judgment. Sometimes getting it out of my head and into words helps me process, and having someone else’s support (even if I don’t need their advice) feels helpful.
3	music helps me, and breathing. mindfulness too.
2	Music!
2	I recently moved across the country to be with my SO and it was ROUGH. Everything was so new and getting settled took longer than I thought it would, and I overthought everything to the point I worried I made a huge mistake and would never feel at home. But affirmations from my friends and SO helped the most. I had to force myself to share what I was feeling when it was less than great, and my support system really helped me see things were better than I assumed. Also, keeping things tidy and having a good soundtrack kept me sane through the transition.
2	Overpreparing. For example, writing a script before getting on a phone call that is making me nervous. Or googling the hell out of a new place/experience. The more familiar I am with something the more I thrive in that scenario, which obviously isn't possible with new experiences. So at least researching can help me feel a bit prepared for the unknowns. \n\nAnother thing, sometimes I get the nervous feeling even for experiences that I have had repeatedly. Putting on a go-to comforting outfit helps (one that I know I feel great in/doesn't make me feel too 'new'). 
2	I always rationalize what I'm thinking when my I'm going into overdrive with worries (for example, if my inferior Ne is giving me negative possibilities, I'll quickly remind myself of why something like that just isn't possible to calm myself down.)  I don't know why, but I like to think out loud when I'm nervous, but I always do this in private - developing a full understanding of what I'm saying and what I mean always helps me feel better.  It helps me feel like I have control over my emotions, which I like.
1	Thank you all for your responses! They sound familiar and I’ll definitely turn to practicing them, going forward. I appreciate you all !! 
1	One thing that helps a lot is when I ask my partner or a friend to read me a fairy tale or a short story that's engaging. I have a pile of folk tales books for this very purpose.\n\nAlso, when stress is work-related, I cut down my task in smaller manageable ones and do them in sequential order. I'm a translator, so for instance if I'm stressed out by a big text, I cut it down in 200 word bits and I make a doodle every time I finish one. One after the other, slowly but surely, and it's not overwhelming any more.
1	I certainly do experience the same kinds of anxiety. One thing that might help is doing a little research on whatever you're planning on doing. Maybe watch some videos of people doing those things. \n\nAnother great tool is mindfulness meditation. I especially like meditating on gratitude because when you're truly thankful, it's harder to get carried away by negative emotions.\n\nHope this helps!
9	Is there a lot going on in your mind behind the exterior?	Hello, I'm an INTJ and I've noticed you all speak in a rather simplistic manner. My partner is an ISFJ, and as someone who needs an individual that can be replied upon, most of the time he fits the bill. He has earned my trust and I love him dearly. Regardless, I know my way of speaking to be a bit fanatical at times – I'm quite exuberant when I have an idea. I get him to do things he never thought he'd do. My ISFJ finds me immensely intriguing, I think that's the main reason he is with me.\n\nAnyway... Your reddit posts, him, nearly ISFJ I've come across online. You all seem so straightforward, it's odd to me. Are you guys hiding anything? What's more is there to you beyond what you project? Even if it is anecdotal I want to know, but I'm not entirely sure that you would want to answer such a question.\n\n2nd, optional question: Imagine yourself in a relationship with an intriguing, slightly unpredictable INTx type. Do you think that'd be fun, the somewhat mysterious nature of that individual? 
18	I mean... it depends on the individual, I think? But we’re all human, and most of us think a lot, and most of us think a lot of things we never tell anyone else. \n\nPersonally, I think straightforward communication is just the easiest thing. What’s the point of playing games? I’m a bad liar, and I don’t like deceiving people or putting on airs, but there are absolutely still things that I keep tucked away. \n\nExamples, if you’d like: \n\nI tend to present as fairly pragmatic as far as romance goes, but I have a soft place very close to the core of who I am where I dream of a sweet, soft romance with someone who seeks to understand me and pursues me because they find me desirable.\n\nIn real life, I like things and practices that are simple and humane. I find the concept of some revolting inhumanities quite interesting, but I’m not likely to discuss that with others. \n\nThere are preferences I keep to myself because I know others will think they’re silly or roll their eyes at me for them. Types of music, aesthetic preferences, opinions and feelings about myself and my life that tend to make people go “oh, come on.” \n\nGenerally speaking, I keep to myself what I expect to be rejected for, because if I trust you with something, I want you to respect it and at least try to understand it. A dismissive reaction is incredibly hurtful when I share an intimate detail or an odd opinion, because I share them with very few people. \n\nAnyway, I’m not sure if that answers your question, but I think we’re all plenty complex. Our brains work differently, but they don’t work any less than any other type’s. If we’re straightforward, I think it’s just because it’s easier. There’s no point in making things convoluted, and it usually just stands in the way of effective communication. We like for people to be comfy. 
7	I consider the intj kind of like a plotting selfish octopus, big brain, very sneaky with their motives and getting what they want, once they know, they'll do what they'll have to in order to get what they want. Isfjs are like a happy Christmas Elf, like the elf played by will Ferrell. Just enjoying happy feelings, such happy things in front of their eyes, yay, good times. No need to worry.\n\nThey genuinely love making others happy, family, they don't like thinking about politics, climate change, war, cancer,  corporate control of government, nuclear holocaust, etc. Just happy thoughts! 😉 This is my understanding, after studying my isfj for years.
6	find myself attracted to mysterious guys sometimes, and yeah I'm hiding something, but that doesn't mean I can be straightforward. I'm a very private human being, and I never tell anyone I don't trust 100 percent any personal information. Why? It's just what I find natural. It's not like I walk around consciously hiding information from people because I don't trust them. it's unconscious, I just don't find it natural to share information with people I don't trust, or feel like don't like me.
6	I think a lot of us do most of our brain processing with images (other ISFJs please chime in if you feel otherwise). Images rich in meaning, emotion, and possibility. \n\nI design cities in my head when I'm bored, it's hard to get out of my head because well it's fun to imagine. How can I describe what I see with just words, and who honestly cares but me? \n\nIt's easier to skip explaining the details of my own musings and just be straightforward. I suppose some think I'm boring, or just think that I don't think at all. But they are wrong, there is a lot going on behind the exterior.
3	(ISxJ F)\n\nI'm usually not hiding anything. Generally speaking, when any person gets more long-winded in an answer, they're more likely to be hiding something. \n\nI like to be straightforward because it leaves little room for miscommunication, and miscommunication is a b\*tch.
11	What's everyone's favorite season? Why?	
12	Hmm. I will have to say Fall. It's not to cold and not to hot.  Just the perfect temperature. 
11	Winter!  I love the cold and being warm and cozy inside.  Sleeping cuddled under blankets.  No bugs (mosquitoes, wasps, gnats, horseflies, chiggers, ticks, all plague me), so taking walks outside is enjoyable.  I like the short days and it getting dark early.  Living in a warmer climate, winter never lasts long enough for me.  \n\nThis might be a bit weird?  I'm a night owl and feel happier and more energetic at night.  The heat and long days of summer make me depressed.  It's like I have opposite SAD.
8	Spring, because it starts to get warmer, days get longer, my birthday is coming, life starts anew.
4	I like summer. I really enjoy warm weather and my birthday is in summer. I also really love the beach so summer is ideal!
4	I like them all except winter. I hate being cold and I hate that it gets dark where I live at 6:00 pm.
5	Summer. I love warm summer nights and how it stays light really late. Fall is my second favorite. I like the changing colors of trees and all or the holidays. I just don’t like how when we change the clocks back it gets dark at like 3pm. 
3	Summer,, becaause I love to go down to the beach when it's warm outside. Also I think I have seasonal affective disorder for the winter months :|
3	Fall. It’s where I feel most like myself (which is something I struggle with) and where I feel most connected to poetry and music, which are things I love. Fall just feels like home 
3	Naturally I want to say autumn but it’s probably spring bc that’s when everything comes to life again! The sun shines, flowers bloom, the fresh scent💚 \n*This can also be bc I live in a predominately rainy area, but then again rainbows :))))
2	Summer is mine. Being in nature and replenishing my spirit 
2	Fall. I love the colors and the things that come with it like scarfs and Halloween and Thanksgiving!
2	the transition from summer to fall where you can where long pants + a t shirt without a coat and be a good temperature 
2	Fall, right up through Christmas and New Year’s. Beautiful colors, the feeling of anticipation in the air, sometimes actual chill (hey, southern US)... it’s like going back to childhood for some reason. And ending with cozy lights and gifts and family. 😊
2	I love summer!!
1	I live in a place where there are only two seasons: burning humid hell and Noah’s ark part 2. If I lived in a country where there are four seasons, I think I would love autumn. I’ve never experienced it but I feel like I would like the mood.
1	I love winter, autumn, summer :)
1	Winter,
1	Autumn is mine, closely followed by winter.
1	Spring and summer are my favorite because of the warm weather. (I live in SC.) Autumn is pretty, but sometimes it gets too cold too fast for me. I hate winter because of the cold, dry weather, and the reduced daylight. (I got myself a therapy lamp this year to help with Seasonal Affective Disorder.) The only thing I like about winter is the occasional light snow because it makes everything look brighter for a little while.
5	How do you all react when you're frustrated in a video game?	I don't know about everyone else on this sub, but I have a very interesting reaction when playing a game with a frustrating part. Instead of getting upset and crying about it... I get hysterical. I'm laughing hard as ever over how absurd the challenge is, and I keep attempting it. Possibly if it's pattern based repeating what I need to out loud so i can remember what i need to do.\n\nAnyone have any similar reactions? Or just unusual reactions when at a frustrating spot in a game? 
6	I don’t get hysterical. I usually get frustrated/annoyed and leave it for a bit to come back to it later, when I’m ready to try again. But there’s one Gameboy Color game that I’ve basically given up on.. after 14 years. I haven’t gotten the nerve to come back and work at it!
5	I never get frustrated or annoyed during games or sports. I do laugh though like you :D ..when I keep failing, I laugh, chuckle, IDK why that happens.. 
2	Same. I got a funny look just a few days ago because I was cracking up hard after dying in Mario. I think it was just the absurdity of the death that got to me. I promise I was trying to win but to the casual observer it would have appeared that I jumped in a hole for no reason. But usually it's two or three laughs, being frustrated, then quitting for a while when I start failing at the same spot repeatedly.
2	I get angry at first. Then I just get my husband to clear that part for me. Some video games have parts that are just too difficult for me, specifically timed events.
1	I don't get frustrated when I'm playing video games.  I might say  "fuck " in a normal tone of voice.  
0	I don't get very frustrated , sometimes I just feel a  trembling feeling in my body
12	What's your Enneagram type?	Mine is 6w7.\n\nEdit: For those that are new to enneagram, you can take the test here- [Enneagram Test](https://www.eclecticenergies.com/enneagram/test) 
10	6w5 with strong 5 influence apparently.
9	9w1
9	9w1 here.
6	I took it for the first time this weekend. I’m a 2w1
6	I'm a 2w1.
6	Just took it last night and found out I’m a 6w5.
4	2w1
3	>You are most likely a type **5 or 6 or 9**.    \n>  \n>Taking wings into account, you seem to be a **5w6 or 6w5** \n\nFitting. And interesting.\n\nI read all three types and it's really hard to pick only one.
3	I hadn’t taken this test before so thanks for bringing it up! I’m 5w6.
3	1w2. little different from the rest of the answers here :/
3	5w6!
2	According to the test. Im a definite 2, but my wings are balanced. \n\nHowever, i looked over the other ones it said i might have, and 9 might also work as mine. Maybe even better than a 2. \n
2	I’m a 6w7 also. 
2	6w7 ☺️
2	2w3 here
2	Balanced six
2	6w5 :)
2	I usually get 2w1 when I take the test with 6 coming in a close second. \n\nEdit: After looking at the types again. I’m pretty sure I’m a 6w7 and not a 2w1. 
2	I've been typed as a 6 by online acquaintances (the full tritype being 6w5 4w5 9w1, "The Seeker"). Despite it's reliability I sometimes question my full tritype. However, i'm pretty dead set on being a Six. This [one video in particular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gRAEkpOcUA) hit so hard i gushed out literal tears.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn a related tangent, i believe most ISFJs would be 2, 6, and 9. Keep in mind that this is mostly my conjecturing and i mostly have done research into 6 and 9. Anyways, 2 because the very nature of shame and martyrdom really aligns with ISFJ's demonstrative Fi+ "no no no, i'm a good person". 6 partly in because, well, Si dom and inferior Ne. 9 because Pi. IxxJs in general are glacial. 1 may also be a possibility. 
2	9w1
1	I'm either a 5w4 or a 1w9. More likely 5.
30	Do any of you guy's buried emotional baggage deep inside and never bring it up with love ones? Or just people in general?	Sorry for constantly posting on this subreddit,  my mind been racing with so many thoughts lately.  Forgive me.  Anyway,  I was watching a video earlier today and this woman caught my attention. She said if you " had a bad childhood and you're an adult you need to get over it. "  Personally,  I try my best to keep my past to myself and buried it inside.  However,  I don't think you can just get over it. I honestly don't.  I came to realization that I should never speak about my demons to anyone.  It's hard to explain.  I hate leaving myself vulnerable and manipulated when I do talk about my past.  I've been betrayed countless times.  I just want to know if is it wrong for me to feel like this? I don't even talk to my family about my inner demons.  I've built a wall around myself to protect myself from potential pain. I hope I'm not the only one who feels like this .
15	I bury it so deep sometimes I don’t even realize I have baggage, until one day I’m like “OH F*CK where are these emotions coming from” or “hey that’s whats been going on,  that makes sense.”\n\nAlso I tend to keep my emotional baggage to myself because I’m scared of making someone else’s day harder due to my problems or I don’t want to sound like a broken record  (y’all know how we isfjs get stuck in loops sometimes) 
11	You and me are in the same boat. It’s hard to get over past baggage and it’s not a simple as just forgetting about it. I almost never bring up any emotional baggage to family members/friends because I’m afraid of being judged and manipulated. Ive been manipulated before but luckily I didn’t lay out my whole past for that person. I’d suggest getting a journal and writing in it when you feel upset. I feel that journaling really helps me feel refreshed and sets my mind straight. 
1	>I came to realization that I should never speak about my demons to anyone. It's hard to explain. I hate leaving myself vulnerable and manipulated when I do talk about my past.\n\n>I don't even talk to my family about my inner demons. I've built a wall around myself to protect myself from potential pain.\n\nThis sounds like Childhood Emotional Neglect to me. I know the term might sound harsh, but I HIGHLY suggest looking into it! Dr. Jonice Webb is like the leading founder on it, or whatever, she wrote a book, I'm reading it, and so far I definitely recommend. Take this https://drjonicewebb.com/cenquestionnaire/ questionnaire, it might help you. There's a questions like, do you like animals more than people, do your friends think you're aloof/distant, do you feel like you're on the outside looking in, do you have trouble asking for help, do you have a hard time knowing what you're feeling, do you frequently feel upset for no reason at all, do you feel awkward in social situations. There's like 20 total, it'll take like 10 minutes if you know yourself pretty well, or longer if you don't. But I PROMISE it is definitely worth looking into, and if it fits, than maybe you can heal. Wishing you the best!
6	How to find your ideal romantic partner	I've just finished reading Helen Fisher's book "Why Him, Why Her?".\n\nMy question is, are you a Builder/Negociator or a Negociator/Builder?\n\nIt's a fascinating book and she explains the type of person we gravitate towards.\n\nI'm an ENTP, Director/Explorer in her personality quiz. She says that the best matches are the following:\n\nExplorer-Explorer\n\nBuilder-Builder\n\nDirector-Negociator\n\nI noticed many ISFJ's on this forum saying that they gravitate towards ENTP personality type. Are you a Negociator or a Builder? Are we a good match?\n\nTake this quiz:\n\n[https://theanatomyoflove.com/relationship-quizzes/helen-fishers-personality-test/personality-test-1/](https://theanatomyoflove.com/relationship-quizzes/helen-fishers-personality-test/personality-test-1/)
6	well I find entp's nature attractive and find myself attracted to them.  but other times i find myself attracted to the mysterious quiet type. 
1	**NEGOTIATORS** are philosophers. These women (and men) express traits linked with the estrogen system in the brain. These people see the big picture. They are imaginative and intuitive. They have superb language and people skills. They are also emotionally expressive, as well as agreeable, trusting and compassionate. Negotiators seek someone with whom they can make an intensely intimate, deeply meaningful, inspiring and spiritual connection. But Negotiators, like Directors, prefer to go out with one person at a time and to explore the depths of this potential partnership. They dislike wasting time on irrelevant, trivial or boring socializing. When they find “The One,” Negotiators are superb at generating and maintaining intimacy with this partner. They avoid conflicts with a mate, and make major personal adjustments to strengthen this cherished bond. They give thoughtful gifts, such as a treasured book or photograph. They share their most personal feelings. And they want their partner to share his or her feelings too.\n\n*Negotiators are often attracted to their opposite, Directors.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour score on the Explorer scale is 23 out of a possible 42, or 55%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour score on the Builder scale is 27 out of a possible 42, or 64%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour score on the Director scale is 22 out of a possible 42, or 52%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour score on the Negotiator scale is 41 out of a possible 42, or 98%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n..got these restults... so, I'm a Negotiator... where's my Director :D ..as for ENTP and ISFJ being a match, I haven't got close to any ENTP, but I am curious to know an ENTP after seeing so many ENTP/ISFJ couples :) ..thanks for posting the quiz!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat about you, what's your opinions on ENTP-ISFJ match?

1	I took the quiz, but i dont remember my exact scores. they were similar to mostly everyone around here though. I’m a Negotiator/Builder. Ghis was a very interesting post, and what the negotiator’s description is is so me, as well as a little bit of the builder. I never considered looking at the other personality types for looking at romance. or even ENTPs specifically. i’m not sure I actually know any.

These women (and men) express traits linked with the estrogen system in the brain. These people see the big picture. They are imaginative and intuitive. They have superb language and people skills. They are also emotionally expressive, as well as agreeable, trusting and compassionate. Negotiators seek someone with whom they can make an intensely intimate, deeply meaningful, inspiring and spiritual connection. But Negotiators, like Directors, prefer to go out with one person at a time and to explore the depths of this potential partnership. They dislike wasting time on irrelevant, trivial or boring socializing. When they find “The One,” Negotiators are superb at generating and maintaining intimacy with this partner. They avoid conflicts with a mate, and make major personal adjustments to strengthen this cherished bond. They give thoughtful gifts, such as a treasured book or photograph. They share their most personal feelings. And they want their partner to share his or her feelings too.\n\nNegotiators are often attracted to their opposite, Directors.\n\nPretty interesting quiz. 
12	How do you guys prepare/cope for a brewing shitstorm? What is your coping skills when you're going through bullshit?	Without going in details,  there is a shit storm brewing in my life.  I can feel it so strongly in my gut. Usually when shit like this happen I withdrawn myself and think before I do something irrational because of my emotions.  How many of you guy's feel this way? I'm usually a pretty mellow guy,  however if someone keep testing me I can become extremely angry.  I don't want that... I  always feel guilty when I lose my chill demeanor.  How do you guys cover up your anger when dealing with stupid bullshit? Sorry for grammar mistakes.
5	thank you for sharing.\n\nI don’t cover up my anger, now.  I used to. Gave me terrible life long problems.  \n\nNow, I’m able to show them the whites of the eyes and the whites of my teeth.  Get angry.\n\nIt’s always measured, well thought through.  So, usually someone will have royally pissed me off!! Because, I do have the patience and kindness of a saint!  Chilled out.\n\nSo I’ll go away and work out what they have done, work out if I want to challenge them about their behaviour.  Some battles are not worth fighting.\n\nThen I’ll choose to confront said person, even if it’s 3 weeks or whatever time after what happened!!!  (I’ll leave it sometimes if it’s to long). \n\nI’ll choose place and time of confrontation.  And I’ll say everything I want to say, if I want to say everything.  And sometimes I won’t say all I want to say.  \n\nThis is sort of trivial life stuff, but someone will have crossed my boundaries without permission, unknowingly hurt me, or been down right malicious.  And then I’ll choose how much anger to express!!!  And then it’s done.\n\nAnd I give right to respond.  \n\nBut me mum treats me like shit sometimes, and it’s been like living in a near permanent shit storm with her, so I’m used to this now.\n\nI never used to be able to express anger!! I would shake all over if I got angry!!!\n\nOr bottle it up and feel terrible.\n\nI hope my comment helps you.\n\n😊\n\nBut I also have almighty rants in my flat!! Effing and jeffing!!  Using profanities, get my anger out at home, home alone.  Ranting through how they have hurt me, working out my response, out loud.  I’ve been doing that for say last 4yrs or so!!  More frequently anyhow.  \n\nI have detached flat above 2 shops, no one can hear me.  I rant usually at night when shops are closed.  Only a few people work in shops anyhow.  And they are not busy.  Builders office, till register ship.  One man works there, goes out to do jobs.  \n\nPhew!! Long reply.  \n
2	Uhg sorry you're feeling that pressure of an incoming shit storm. I feel it too.\n\nThis weekend I went on a walk to cool off over something a family member said and we both swept it under the rug... I think... I have my bags packed just in case. \n\nI don't know what is going on in your life but as a general rule of thumb set boundaries, stay true to them, keep calm, and put the distance between you and the shot storm if needed, especially if the person/people are toxic.\n\n\n\n
2	Basically, pray. (I'm a Christian.)
37	I been told I "think to much." Do any of you guy's suffer from this? Is it normal for our personality type to overthink everything.	I'm not going to lie,  I have a tendency of always being in my head.  
25	I'm often told that I'm "boring" because I overthink even for the smallest situation, and that I should "take it easy." I truly do think before taking action because I don't want to cause any conflicts.
21	Yes. I over think everything. I am NOT spontaneous. I have to think out every possible scenario before making a decision. It makes life with a spontaneous spouse very strained sometimes. \n\nI love and hate it at the same time. For my career it works well. For my life, I feel like it holds me back sometimes (...a lot of times).\n\nI'll also often keep myself up late unable to sleep or wake up in the middle of the night overthinking/replaying situations from the previous day or thinking about things I have to do the next day.
17	Over analyze things until you have lost the opportunity sometimes. It’s a disadvantage I find. Spontaneous actions don’t always happen without a plan or perceived outcome.
8	if you're happy and you know it overthink,\nif you're happy and you know it overthink,\nif you're happy and you know it,\nand you really want to blow it,\nif you're happy and you know it overthink!
17	Yes, I like to think about and contemplate things. I have trouble just diving into an activity or project. A personal trainer put it nicely, that I seem very "cerebral", having to think about any exercise for a bit before doing it. On the down side, I also tend to build up stress by overthinking/worrying about things that are on the horizon in my life. 
8	Yes I’m always thinking and over analyzing and trying to read peoples minds. It’s super exhausting. We tend to be sensitive creatures too so this overthinking can lead to ruminating in these ideas we have constructed in our head which have no actual basis in reality; ie that that person over there who may have said something to me that I didn’t like must hate me. I did one thing wrong one time at work and my boss will never forget it and probably remembers that one bad thing over all the amazing things I do on a regular basis. \n\nThings I think help:\n- try to shut off for a little bit and be present. I live in a major urban area and when I ride public transportation I try and just look out the window, observe the people around me. Not think....just see. Not be on my phone, scrolling social media, trying to respond to all my texts and emails. Just try and relax for a moment. \n- meditate. This also shuts your mind off and is amazingly refreshing\n- exercise. Another great way to clear your head. I do actually find myself thinking a lot and solving problems while I exercise. But the combination of the endorphin release makes me feel amazing, so overthinking in this case is ok. \n- listen to music or podcasts. I find this quiets my mind a little too. If I’m not listening to something else, I’m likely listening to my own persistent thoughts. 
5	My SO is like this. I just kiss him till he can’t think. Works thus far 😚 
5	i struggle with overthinking in every aspect of my life. i think it really affects my stress level and anxiety. i really hate it but cant help it.
3	Yeah I relate. I can be very contemplative and sometimes I can detach from the situation to think. I also overthink a lot when it comes to relationships tension or things that have gone wrong in them. Remember as ISFJs we have Introverted Thinking as our third function so it makes sense that we would overanalyze a lot. My Ti is probably pretty decently developed as the result of being around a lot of xxTPs. 
1	Same here i think im pretty much the hypersensitive type i look out for other people’s behaviours and feelings most of the time and do things to ensure everyone feels comfortable but it leaves me feeling rather unsatisfied since i would prioritise others over myself especially when our interests clash i feel like im overanalysing myself/ my surroundings/ conversations sometimes and others often tell me to take things easy though its difficult for me
1	yeah
7	Help Me Find Some Closure: ISFJ and INTJ	Hello everyone,\n\nI’m an INTJ/ISFJ girl new to the forum and I was wondering if you all could offer some insight on a situation that has been troubling me for a while now.\n\nIn my freshman year of high school, I met an ISFJ male at school.  Every day, he would walk across the whole cafeteria to eat with me in the opposite corner, come sit by me in the library, and always waited with me by the lamppost after school.  Through his persistence, we became close friends.  He trusted me to the point of telling me very private secrets about his past.  I eventually got him a job working as a gardener and farmhand for my parents.  One day, he told me that he liked me.  I replied that his feelings must not interfere with his work, and I declined to give him a definitive answer back.  To complicate the situation, my parents decided to give him a truck so that he could commute to work without constantly having to rely on people to give him a ride.  On his eighteenth birthday, I gifted him a laminated four-leaf clover I discovered in the woods behind my house.  A few weeks passed, and I addressed the topic of his feelings for the first time.  After a bit of flustered banter back and forth, I admitted that I liked him back.  He was planning to return to his home state of Kentucky upon graduation in May, but he said he would stay in ILif I wanted him to.  We never formally spoke about this occurrence again, though I occasionally saw him when he worked at the farm over the summer to build a livestock pen.  Most of our interactions were through text or chat sites, as I was rather busy that year.  My mother was extremely overprotective, and would not let me freely interact with friends, especially not guy friends, without supervision.  He once tried to ask my mother if I could go hiking with him or if he could drive me home on early dismissal days, but my parents always refused.  Meanwhile, the livestock pen was taking quite a while to build, so my mother would often ask him how much longer it would take.  She began to put pressure on me to hurry him, and finally I wore out and went off on him during a text conversation.  In the heat of the moment, I told him I was upset that he did not come to work regularly and that I got the impression that he never considered me a friend (my mother’s idea). He was quite affected by it, and I felt rather remorseful afterwards.  We made up the next day.  After that, he texted me every time he was working to let me know he was.\n\nTo give you an idea of our drastic background differences, I am the daughter of Taiwanese immigrants and he was a Scotch-Irish country boy from the backwoods of Kentucky. In my parents’ traditional culture, interracial relationships are forbidden, and I mentioned it once to him.  He became very angry and the conversation was never brought up again.\n\nFall arrived, and I returned to school.  We had a series of spotty conversations, always abruptly stopped because he was busy doing something.  I could never figure out what he was occupied with, but I did not want to become a burden of annoyance so I never ventured to ask.  I messaged him one day with my regular greeting, and he sent back on the chat site: “Hey, I don’t think we should talk on here anymore.  I work 9 to 5 every weekday and the stock pen has taken so long that I don’t want to risk upsetting your parents.”  Though I felt a cold weight drop in my stomach, I replied with a terse: “Okay, that sounds like a good idea.”  He responded with “Yeah, sorry.”  That was September, and it was the last time we ever spoke.\n\nHe was killed in a workplace accident a month and a half later.  The day after, I was called down to the school office.  It was his sister, and he told me that they found in his pocket the clover I gave him and she gave it back to me.  She told me that my friend had told their dad that he was staying in town to wait for me to graduate and turn eighteen (I was fifteen then), though he wouldn’t do anything without my parents’ permission, namely my father’s.  I went down to his hometown for the funeral, and I was surprised that his relatives in Kentucky recognized me, saying that he often spoke about me.  However, I don’t know if his feelings changed since the time he’d told his family in the summer.\n\nI know that it is impossible to know what was going through his mind, but he was an ISFJ and I was hoping that you ISFJs could help me make light of this situation that has been troubling my mind.\n\nSome questions:\n\nWhy do you think he stopped talking?  Was it because of the weight of responsibility, or was it because he no longer cared?\n\nWas he planning to date or was he wanting a marital relationship?\n\nWould he have re-established communications?\n\nThank you for any insights you may offer.
6	((hugs)) He obviously cared for you but was unable to express it due to your young age, your parents, differences in age & background
4	hard to say, maybe he was afraid and made assumptions about what you may do or what may happen
1	I think he cared, but was trying to move on. Isfjs are often really into marriage, so most likely of he was into you, the thought crossed his mind. He probably wouldn't have restarted conversion because he wouldn't want the conflict\n\n I could be wrong, but dating an isfj for 4-5 years has taught me my specific ones thought process
13	Balancing moments of silence with conversation?	Hi I have a really awesome ISFJ friend who I feel a strong connection to...as friends but potentially more?\n\nHe has moments where he'll come to talk to me about certain important things in his life - but only if I've already been talking to him.  He rarely initiates the conversation. As an ENFP it's quite frustrating because all I want is to talk about everything all the time, but I understand he's not always in the mood to talk or on his phone.\n\nShould I give him space to allow him to talk to me first sometimes or just continue initiating because that's who I am (and he should maybe accept that)?\n\nAnd one more question - why so mysterious? Do you guys need complete trust to be who are with a person?
18	yeah we are really private, and I only give out personal stuff to people I trust completely. and if it were me, I would like you to continue initiating with me. if you find this annoying(us not taking initative) then tell them. if they care about you they will listen to what you say, and try to to take it into consideration. give them time. \n\nI think you need to be somewhere in between, tell them that it would be good if they also took initative to talk to you sometimes, and that you would really appericate it. but also continue taking initative. Be open about it!:) \nI hope it will go your way!  
9	A lot of my friends have to be the ones to initiate conversation, and they understand that I'll reply when I feel up to it. Sometimes that's a few seconds, sometimes it's three days. I don't see any harm in continuing to initiate conversation!\n\n(Also yes, we're private about a lot of things, but most ISFJs are easy to talk to about non-personal matters!)
7	My friends have to initiate conversation with me too. 9 times out of 10 I appreciate this, but I am easily overwhelmed by daily conversation; if I don’t have anything to say, I won’t force it. Be sure to leave him time for himself. We introverts really appreciate that. ;)
6	ask him about it. if my friend asked me why i don’t initiate conversations, i would try to text him more often. \n\ni personally like it when my friends are the first ones to text or call me, so you should continue being yourself and initiating the conversation. don’t worry if he doesn’t initiate the conversation, because he still cares about you. he just might be doing something else or might not be in the mood. \n\nand i trust my friends, it’s just that i am not always comfortable sharing my strong opinions or feelings with them. but i’ve told some of my friends A LOT about myself because i know they will not judge me and because they’re genuinely interested.
15	How do ISFJs cope with business settings where narcissistic people feed off your extraverted feeling? I'm beaten...	I'm an INFJ, but writing to see if any ISFJ is relatable to this topic 'cause they have the function of their extraverted feeling is as big as ours.\n\nAs a person with extraverted feeling, I, by my very nature, seek for emotional connections, harmony and soulful beautiful moments. However, in many business/office settings, this nature is not needed or even become bait that attracts narcissistic professionals. They feed off other people's emotions, especially people in management/HR positions, they try to control and oppress their employees, and when we show our frustration/sadness, voila! that's what they had waited for and their tidbit.\n\nAnother aspect of business is... I need to deal with cold-hearted assholes who never ever care about me or others. I am okay with technical/dry conversations with someone who just concentrates on business, but can't stand having conversations with someone who sees me just as his supply/slave, not as a human and who doesn't care about my feelings/health/opinions at all...(There's a clear line between being 'businesslike' and 'cold')\n\n\nI'm not certified to teach in public school, provide medical treatments or work for church (all of which seem to demand more extraverted feelings), so I end up working with narcissistic office people, sigh.\n\nI know the degree of extraverted feeling varies (mine is 65 %) and some people with extraverted feeling don't suffer as much as I do.
5	You're not in sync with your nature. Neither am I working in a factory. I'd be better off as a therapist of some kind. But such is life.
1	Doesn't sound like you are in the right career.
8	What does an ISFJ's ideal vacation look like?	Hey everyone! I'm an INTP, I live in the heart of New York City, and I'm going to be entertaining an ISFJ visitor for three days who has never experienced the city before. The primary purpose of her traveling to New York is so that she can spend some time with me, because we live far away from one another. \n\nHow should I go about making sure that her three days in New York are as good as possible for her? I'm asking this because I realize that we have always taken radically different approaches to traveling. We seem to appreciate completely different things, and I don't want to end up dragging her through nothing but the sorts of activities that I would enjoy. Especially because she seems to have difficulty saying "no" to activities when others suggest them, I want to make sure that I'm not forcing my interests onto her. What sort of events, activities, sights, etc. do you like to do when traveling? What sort of things do you NOT like to do/find boring?\n\nShe has booked a hotel room across the street from my apartment because I live in a studio and I don't have proper room for guests. I've given her general instructions for getting to my apartment from the airport and although I know she's always worried about getting lost, I'm sure she'll be fine - otherwise, I'll probably be handling all of the navigation. \n\nI realize that judging types are much more comfortable when they can plan out activities, travel logistics and details in advance. I'm terrible at doing this - so what sorts of things should I take into consideration that I may not have considered yet? \n\n&#x200B;
25	My ideal vacation has a few planned activities (I like visiting museums and local shops and restaurants), and a lot of down time. I like relaxing vacations, not busy ones. While I like to have a general idea of what each day will look like (Monday is sightseeing/shopping day, Tuesday is lounging/reading on the beach day, etc), I don't like to have every minute planned out. I don't know if that's much help!
6	Hi. \n\nIf I was coming to stay at yours.  I’d want to go to Central Park, probably spend a whole day there, if the weathers good, maybe take a picnic, or eat at a near by restaurant.  \n\nMaybe, walk over 1 or 2 of the big bridges.  Go on the subway.  \n\nTravel on a boat going by the Statue of Liberty, but don’t need to get off at the island.  \n\nGo for a drive in a yellow cab.  I’d like to actually see some of the rough/poor parts of New York.\n\nI’d like to eat at a diner, go to a bar, in the day time.  \n\nAnd I’d like to go to a show, either Opera, ballet, classical music, avant guard dance, theatre.  \n\nCan’t remember how many nights it is?  3 or 4.  But, I only want to go out one night.  \n\nAnd I do want to go to the 9/11 memorial and spend several hrs there, maybe even a whole day, and deffo got to go see the subway white spikey building around there.  \n\nAnd maybe try to get to some of New York’s more or less known architectural highlights. \n\nThat’s my perfect New York, 3 day stay.  \n\nThank you.  \n\nAnd I think this girl needs spoiling, like being her personality type, if you went to stay at hers, she would do everything for you.\n\nSo, be yourself totally, with all you’re quirks ect...  but please, do you’re best for her.  \n\n
6	I would suggest some super low-key places like museums and libraries that aren't likely to have a lot of loud and obnoxious people. Also, if she is coming to spend time with you, just chilling at home with her for some time might be a good idea too! As an INFJ, we Fe users don't mind if other people take the reigns. As long as you don't take her to a non-introvert friendly place she should be fine.
3	Edit: I changed up some of this.\n\nIf it’s someplace like New York, I want to experience all those places I’ve seen in movies: Empire State Building, Central Park, Times Square, that kinda thing. I would have a mental list of the things I specifically want to see and do, then a few other things that aren’t necessary but would be nice. A nice dinner one night would be good, but then staying in the next night.\n\nHonestly, I would ask her first! If she gives you some things she wants to do, come up with a plan that you think would be easiest and least stressful time-wise.\n\nIf she’s not sure, give her a couple options - “we could go walk around in Chinatown, or we can hang out at my place, or we can go see something (wherever).” And make it clear that you’re cool with whatever she wants to do. 😊\n\nAlso, subway maps may be fun and sometimes helpful.
9	Death.
1	Whatever activities you choose to do, try to have some semblance of a plan / schedule. I feel more at ease if I can know what we are doing in advance and can prepare accordingly.
1	Just spent the past few days in Chicago and NYC as a quick getaway trip, and I really enjoyed spending a couple hours of the day exploring the city and sightseeing (riverwalk, wicker park, central park, and times square).. but that being said, I loved having some down-time after a couple hours of walking/exploring. Spent several hours trying mini retro coffee shops and dessert places. Also crashed at the hotel a LOT. \n\ntl;dr ; enjoy sightseeing and exploring, but only for a couple hours. I like my chill time too :D
1	Think white girl drinking Frappuccinos, something like that. Aka, lounging, relaxing, shopping, watching a Christmas movie
6	Have any of you guy's used Tinder? Did you had any sucess? What was your Tinder experienced liked?	I was wondering if Tinder was a good app to start dating again.  I'm not looking for hookups, I want to meet people and see how things will go. 
7	I used it and did have a few relationships from there. In my region, a lot of the matches were looking for something more casual. They were respectful when I mentioned I was hoping for something more serious though. I'm still friends with 1 I matched with from years before.\n\nThe only one that I had a negative experience was an INTP I matched with- I introduced him to MBTI casually and he used it to magnify our differences. But I think it's just due to his immaturity rather than his type haha.
5	I met my boyfriend of a little over 2 years on Tinder.\nHe's an ESFJ, and by far one of the best things that's ever happened to me.\n\n\nI really just downloaded the app for fun, I had no intentions of actually meeting up with anybody on there.\n\n\nHe was the first guy I matched with, and the only one I talked to for more than like, an hour.\nAfter 3 days of talking, we met in person and things have been going great ever since. :)\nI deleted the app after our first date, so I guess my success rate is 100%.\n\n\nOur bios/profiles were equally stupid, mine just said "If you put jam on your grilled cheese, I don't think we're compatible." His had two lines, "Can I walk your dog?" and "My mom thinks I'm handsome."\n\nHe was looking for a serious relationship on there, and while I wasn't expecting to find one on Tinder, I was open to a relationship at that point in my life.\n\n\nI've known tons of people who've had to weed through tons of gross people on Tinder before having any luck, if at all. Lots of people I know have found a long-term partner on there. I think it all just depends on how you use it, and what you're looking for. It's definitely worth a shot, IMO.
1	My two friends and I used it. Succuss rate is 2/3 :)\n\nI did't even know what am I doing it for, but in a week there I found just the guy I needed. People are quite sceptical of Tinder in my country and not many users search for anything serious there. I guess I am very lucky :)\n\nSame thing happened to my friend, although she lives in another country and, I think, her boyfriend was the first guy she met on Tinder. We both are certain we found perfect men :)
1	Sub 7/10 males. No.\n\nAny female. Yes.
1	I know it has worked for a lot of people, but it didn't work for me. I got way more success from OKCupid, where I met my girlfriend (infp) that I've been with for nearly two years. It just gives you a lot more to work with, like lots of personality questions to answer so you can find a great match. 
1	Somehow I have met all my boyfriends off tinder. I’m so shy and humble in real life that I end up being in the background and not wanting to draw attention to myself and have people pay attention to me and thus get overshadowed by all the ESxx types. I just can’t for the life of myself flirt out in the world. Like maybe if I’m out at a bar or party or something that is specifically relaxing time. But if I’m out and about, at work or doing my responsibilities....I am not seeking attention and just come across quite reserved and uninterested. This is not intentional, just is 🤷🏼‍♀️\n\nI didn’t date until I was 21 and started online dating for the reasons listed above. If I am able to attract someone’s attention online first, I feel much more comfortable flirting with them in person. I end up feeling like they already see part of the special side of me that isn’t obviously evident when someone meets me for the first time in person—particularly in a stressful social situation (which lets be honest is every situation that isn’t with my best friends or family). I feel like they had a chance to get to like me a bit and then I can be charming in person. \n\nSo I’m really drawn to tinder, ok Cupid, etc. HOWEVER the shitty part of this is that a lot of people on dating apps, tinder specifically, are just looking to fuck around, not seeking commitment, just flirting for the shit of it. So I’ve been blown off many times, which is super frustrating for a reliable and honest ISFJ. But then again it has taught me to be more cautious with my feelings and to not get my hopes up too early. So all in all I think it’s been a great lesson for me to put myself out there and learn how to navigate the dating scene and grow as a person. 
14	Strong Si and lapses in active listening	Do any of you feel that sometimes you are passively listening to someone when they are telling you something important, even though you are usually an active and engaged listener? Is it because strong Si and our brains are just taking in so many things in that moment and can’t help getting distracted from what the other person is saying? \n\nI hate when I realize I’m doing this bc I’m usually so good at listening and remembering what people have said. Hate to have to ask them to repeat themselves later when I realize I wasn’t listening at all. 
2	Sounds like you are on the verge of a burn out. I’m in your same spot right now. Tooo many things on the go. Don’t want to let anyone down and also put out a great product or service.
2	maybe you're just tired?
2	no
2	I traced the origin of this for me, and I found that when I do that is because I am not doing a good job organizing my mind in a daily and constant basis, so everything becames a mess, a vicious cycle of disorganization. So the result is your mind working constantly trying to fix the mess. This gets in the way of paying attention in the informations to be collected, not only in a conversation, but also when you walk on the street and doesn't pay attention in your surroundings for example, becouse you are inside your head. So, what I try to do when I realize I am in this loop, is to try to relax, calm down my mind, breath, think "everything is going to be ok, I trust myself" and just do things normaly, trying stay away of these improductive thoughts.
1	Sometimes. I have to look away to focus on what the person is saying at times, and block out all other senses, otherwise I might read their faces and tone instead of hearing them.
1	Yes, occasionally. And I always feel bad about it because it probably makes it look like I don’t care. However usually when that happens I’m thinking of my response and how I’m going to say it. 
1	Sometimes.. I zone out..
4	Tips for an ESTJ dating an ISFJ?	I'm new to Reddit and looking for help from the ISFJ's out there. I'm an ESTJ hoping to keep my ISFJ girlfriend fulfilled and happy. Any insight?
9	Just read about ISFJs and try to understand them. Be considerate and remind her of your feelings for her regularly. Tell her how much you appreciate what she does for you/others. It may just be me, but I need some reassurance almost weekly. We’re pretty simple though. Just don’t take her for granted, I guess. It’s a really good sign that you’re reaching out now. You sound like a good one :)
5	tell them what you're going to do before you do it, or else the isfj will jump to conclusions. tell them that you appericate them, and value them. thank them. and don't criticise them with your Si parent.. or do it, but don't do it too much. I think that if you two communicate with each other, and explain why you do things, and tell them what you're going to do, ...I think it can work out !:) pls don't bring out your infj superego to them.. I don't think they'd like that poetic justice being thrown over them. of course,  if they deserve it then bring it on lmao.\n\nsorry if this is inaccurate. I'm an amateur in this.
3	I'm an ISFJ. I would say it's a pretty simple job keeping us happy. Just let her be a part of your life and make her feel like you need her. I'd also suggest finding out what her love language is and doing at least one thing daily in that genre. It looks like some confirmation/affirmation is already suggested, but I'm Quality Time/Physical Touch and I'd much rather have a daily hug than a daily compliment. Knowing which means more to her could be important.
3	I'm dating an amazing ESTJ! \n\nHonestly you'll be fine, I think ESTJ and ISFJ go really well together.\n\nI think the only things that you'd need to watch out for, from my own experience, are \n\n- overanalyzing or focusing too much on something negative; we tend to get overwhelmed with criticism and negativity easily, even if it's not intended to come across that way. You shouldn't have to walk on eggshells, but it's important to compromise. My boyfriend and I took a while to figure out how to criticize and handle criticism from one another, respectively. In regards to overanalyzing, when we first started dating, my boyfriend asked a lot of questions; I know now that he was trying to get to know me better, but a lot of us are very reserved and it can feel like we're being cross-examined. \n\n\n- we have a tendency to sugarcoat things and beat around the bush. If you're like my boyfriend, this might drive you crazy. I got better at being direct with him after he reiterated a few times that he strongly preferred it and made it very clear that I wasn't going to upset him by being direct.\n\n\n- on that note, you might want to try being a little more indirect with her depending on how healthy she is and how well you know her. We have a lot of feelings.\n\n- also if you can, open up about your emotions and give her opportunities to take care of you somehow. We're suckers for that.\n\nBest of luck! 
3	Thank you everyone for the advice! Very, very helpful. My biggest concern is getting her to comfortably share her feelings. It took me a long time to understand how strongly she feels things and how her emotions can change throughout the day (I stay pretty even keeled throughout the day). I'm working on understanding her and not pushing too hard. You guys are great!
2	Don’t steamroll over her.  Give her a chance to speak. Don’t always assume you are right. Listen to her insight (she notices a lot of things and has important input). Be mindful of when she needs a break or some space to decompress. Snuggle her, kiss her and remind her of how special she is to you. Make decisions together and don’t always take control. \n\nThat’s great that you care and are willing to hear what she needs to be fulfilled. Assuming you aren’t super domineering and willing to change/cater some things towards her needs, I’m sure this could work. 
2	blessings to you both :D\n\ntip...hmm......be yourself :) ! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIDK any ESTJ but I love the idea of ESTJ and ISFJ in a romantic relationship.
11	Have any of you ever gotten depressed? How do you deal with it?	edit: I didn’t think there would be so many responses! thank you all for this. And it’s surprising how many of you have experienced depression. Your ways of dealing with it are very nice to hear, and I’ll take all your advice to heart, and even keep it in mind for others. 
10	Yes absolutely—particularly in social situations or amidst conflict among family or friends. \n\nIf it’s severe or chronic...therapy and meds. I can’t really comment on mild depression except to say find the things that make you feel happy and free and make sure to do those things on a regular basis. 
6	I am severely prone to depression, I think as a result of my personality type. I waver between stable and unstable mental health a few times a year with seasonal depression hitting me hard on top of my regular depression. If you struggle as much as me and nothing seems to pull you out of it, I recommend getting medicated.
4	yes, i also have panic disorder. zoloft has done wonders for me. my triggers are family/friend conflicts and self esteem issues
3	I get depressed frequently. I deal with a constant feeling of loneliness and isolation. It’s not always easy dealing with it. Therapy and having great siblings who understand me helps a lot. 
4	I have depression right now.  I cry a lot more than the average person does, I'm pretty sure.  I deal with it by trying to rationalize my problems; if I'm becoming caught up in how happy I used to be, I just tell myself that most people aren't as happy as they were when they were seven.  I've had suicidal thoughts, but my hope in the world and belief in people is part of what's keeping me alive - I do want to live to see the world progress, even though the thought of the future scares me.  I try my best to support other people because I feel that I am not being entirely supported; I send people compliments simply because I feel that they aren't being appreciated often enough, I give people things such as my food because I feel like I'm not worthy enough, etc.  I do want to see a therapist and get better, but I've been too afraid to bring it up to my parents, so for now I just deal with it.
5	Since I was 12 (am 30 now). I've been on antidepressants for the majority of the time, and I go to therapy every 2-4 weeks. The rest of the time, I just try not to judge myself for what I need to do for self-care. Do I need to work extra shifts to avoid having too much time to think? I do it. Do I need to stay home under a blanket and watch The Office for the fifth time? Do it.
3	yes, absolutely. i have found that prayer and just sharing how i feel with people who understand to be helpful. it may sound great to have people who understand but the truth is that it took a lot of trial and error and vulnerability to find people who could come close to understanding how i feel.
3	I'm such a positive, optimistic person but I def get seasonal winter depression. I live in WI and by January/February I'm usually always in a slump. I feel like as I get older I'm getting better abt recognizing it and dealing with it. When I was in Jr High I was really depressed to and ended up going to therapy but I was never prescribed anything, my therapist said that if anything I could have situational depression. I've developed a lot of coping methods as well that really help me so it's not something I deal with often. 
2	nope
1	First: See a doctor and a therapist.\n\nAfter that: I use an app called Youper to help me track my mood and symptoms. It also has cognitive behavior therapy and meditation features.\n\nAlso important: Prayer, Bible study, and a few friends/family I can turn to.
2	Whatsapp group for MBTI enthusiasts	Hi Everyone, we have created a welcoming Whatsapp home. It's a very active group and it's super fun! Everyone is hilarious and very friendly.

2	I like to twist and tuck too. 
2	Fck that’s the solution I needed. Bread box. ISTJ ftw \n\nWe used one of those when I lived with parents, it’s so annoying when bread goes hard (that’s what she said) after someone opening it up. \n\nThat’s for the image 😂😂
2	MBTI Discord Server!	*x-posted to other MBTI subreddits*\n\nHi gang,\n\nI  just created Discord server called MBTI Penpals for any type of  personality to be able to communicate with others of any type of  personality.

Talk with each other in real-time, either via text  chat or voice chat. Enjoy!
2	And a nice username too
14	I hate myself sometimes	So I was just with my friend (ENTP) and I was putting up the pieces in settlers of catan (board game). I wasn’t exactly sure how the pieces fit in the box, so I was taking a little bit of time while he was just watching. I looked over at him and he was slightly chuckling (not in a mean way) and said it was funny watching my thought process in action. He didn’t mean it to be mean, but Immediately I felt very hurt but didn’t say anything since there were others around and I didn’t want to act upset. I just kind of laughed it off. But for some reason that comment really hurt me because i felt stupid because of how I was second guessing everything I was doing and trying really hard to not look dumb while putting the pieces back. I just feel like a total fucking idiot sometimes. I Hate who I am a lot of the time. 
16	Words can linger far longer than you realize. It is also because that we allow them to wound us so deeply because we place emphasis on them.\n\nIf the scenario was different, perhaps say you were putting the pieces back in the box, or solving a puzzle on your own with great difficulty. The only critic in the room is you. There is no pressure to get it done in a specific time frame and any criticism you have is from yourself. To which, as an ISFJ, might feel less hurtful than that of your friends.\n\nWe are prone to insecurity. Worrying about whether we're doing the right or wrong thing. We want to please others and be the best example so that others may follow in our path. When we make mistakes in front of others, it can feel especially demoralizing because perhaps this is not the example you wanted to portray to them. That, if given a second try, you are sure you'd get it right.\n\nRemember that your friend didn't specifically set aside a day to come and see you fail, and laugh at you. No one goes to a restaurant to find someone and talk behind their back as they mock you at the other table. It may feel embarassing to seem like a failure in the eyes of society, but you're only human. And humans make mistakes. In time, they may forget about it completely.\n\n*"“You probably wouldn’t worry about what people think of you if you could know how seldom they do."* -Olin Miller\n\nBe kind to yourself. Your strengths come in careful attention to detail and overwhelming compassion.
8	If that was my game and I saw you put the pieces away slowly I would REALLY appreciate you because I value doing things right and keeping my possessions in good condition. I think this is a good quality :) don’t be down on yourself for being patient! Not many people in the world are patient these days. 
4	Although this sounds like two guy friends, as a female isfj dating an entp (we are duals btw, supposed to be the best relationship)... I would say he probably thought you putting the pieces away was actually adorable in the most masculine way possible. Entps are spazzy (in the best of ways), and isfjs can be very particular. He likely admired you for being so detailed and thoughtful in your process. Don’t be a mind reader - it’s more likely your friend absolutely adores how you go about life, because in theory (and in my experience), we are complementary opposites. Isfjs use\nSi Fe Ti Ne. Entps use Ne Ti Fe Si. We use the same but backwards. We tend to admire their crazy ideas and their brilliant wit, and they tend to admire our methodical approach, stability, and sweetness. \n\nMy point is, you never know what any person is REALLY thinking. Check into cognitive distortions in relation to CBT. This has helped me a ton. I’d say you do what I do a lot: Mindreading. But in reality a person may be thinking the exact opposite to what you think they are, no matter how well you think you can read a person.
13	Any other ISFJ/INTP couples out there?	Without divulging too much on my own relationship, because I know he has a reddit as well and if I could find his posts he can easily find mine, lol.\n\nHow is your relationship going/how did it go? How long has it been going on/did it last? What have been the biggest obstacles? I'm curious if anything I've been experiencing is something that's just common (since it's less of a communication problem like what's expected) in this pairing. 
10	Communication is just plain difficult.
6	My husband is an ENTP, or INTP possibly. I like his Ne brain, and rely on it constantly for fresh perspective. I think it took me awhile to realize what Ne is though, and how to appreciate it. Communication was non linear for him and very linear for me, and I didn't understand why we would struggle to get our points across for awhile until I understood his brain a bit better lol. Now I think it is a freaking awesome super power he has. I realize Myers Briggs is not all that accurate or scientific, but reading up on Ne made it all click for me. That was my biggest thing, in terms of communication.\n\nI think ISFJ and XNTP can be wonderful together. Best of luck!
3	I’m an ISFJ and I dated someone who I think is an INTP (basing this off a quick skim of the description on 16 Personalities) for a little over a year. The biggest issue we faced was me being oversensitive/a bit clingy and him being insensitive/pushing me away when he needed space. We were pretty much unable to see eye to eye about where the other was coming from despite having regular open communication about the issue. We both understood what was going on but we both refused to budge on our wants or make small compromises to fix it. It ended very poorly when this cycled too much for us with no progress toward fixing it. However I don’t think you guys are doomed just based on this! There was other stuff coming into play (I’m a HSP and was struggling with anxiety throughout the relationship) that exacerbated everything in my case. Let me know if you have any questions! 
3	Dated an INTP for a year, it was a total nightmare. The communication just didnt work and I was constantly hurt. Was so relieved once I ended it. Never gonna date an INTP again, its too painful. 
3	I’m an ISFJ, husband is an INTP. We’ve been together almost 9 years now, married 8.5. We get along great! Sometimes there are hurt feelings and misunderstandings, but I feel like that’s going to happen regardless. \nI feel like what is helpful is knowing a variety of things about his personality type. His love language, his learning style, a tendency for concrete vs. abstract, etc. Our MBTI is just one of the tools that goes into work on our relationship. He knows I really struggle with abstract stuff, so he tries to tie conversations/discussions into concrete things. Etc. 
1	Mutual romantic interest between me and an ISFJ man friend for some time now... don’t really know if it will ever get off the ground. It’s long-distance with a language barrier, but sometimes it feels like we’re on very different wavelengths and that’s the real distance. \n\nHe’s not much of a talker so it’s hard to know what’s going on with him. I’m just as bad though. Almost everything I could complain about with him I’m guilty of. \n\nI think if our genders were reversed, we’d probably be dating though. I’m spontaneous “let’s pursue this possibility!” kinda person and he’s cautious. If I were the man I’d be chasing but I’m not really wired that way romantically. 
1	Me me me !! We’ve only been dating for 5 months  but I love him dearly!! \nThe biggest obstacle was starting out- we had some difficulties with “others” but after having a few of those hard conversations and spending more time with each other and simply being there for one another when we needed it has helped tremendously!! \nI love doing things for him, and he notices and appreciates it. \nI’m very happy :) :) :)
1	I'd like to hear your experience, OP!\n\nI've been with my intp bf for a year now. We've had some ups and downs but things are going well now I think. This was his first relationship so I think it was hard to deal with me changes and emotions and stuff.\n\nWe think very differently and I think thats the main problem. I have to learn/try harder to say how I feel and not assume he can infer that based on vague things I've said. But MBTI has helped a lot! 
1	I'm an INTP and I'm with an ISFJ for almost 7 years now. I love her because she's such genuinely good and caring person.\n\nAs others said, communication can be hard, but when you work on that, over time it becomes easier to understand each other without words.\n\nAlso, it's not easy to find a balance in our different perspectives on our relationship: I need a lot of space for myself, whereas she needs to be together as much as possible. I like to undertake things outside the house (sports, friends, other activities), whereas she likes to be home just with me.\n\nWe try our best to overcome these differences and we know how to communicate with each other what we need. It's certainly helpful to know each other's MBTI to have a basic understanding of how we perceive the world. We're doing great most of the time, and we still love each other. 
7	ISFJ vs ESFJ?	I still can't really determine if I am a Si-dom or a Fe-dom.\n\nWhat I've noticed is that I am energized by interactions with *certain* people and not others. If it's a person who I want to like me, then I get almost "high" on the interaction with them to the point where I am jumping out of my skin. When it is someone who I could hardly care about, I get "drained" and just want to whither back into my shell.\n\nThe folks I "like" seem to be the type of people who I feel I have to work towards, or I actually accomplished something by being accepted by them. As in, I had to carefully manipulate my personality to get them to like me. As in, I can't just sit there and do nothing and expect them to gravitate towards me. The people I am drained by are people who are *very very* interested in me for, what seems to be, absolutely no reason at all. Like, I can be completely boring and unengaging around them, and they wouldn't give a shit; they'd treat me the same.\n\nI also get drained by the presence of people who I think have treated me poorly in the past, and "introversion" shoots out.\n\nFinally, I notice that I talk out loud a lot when I'm thinking.\n\nCan any of you guys relate to this? Or am I probably more towards Fe?
4	This has a nice breakdown of Dom Fe vs Aux Fe\n\nhttps://funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/post/93978984579/how-fe-acts-in-all-4-positions
3	How do feel about having many social obligations? As an ISFJ, I can be alone for a while without getting lonely and it's much harder to get to know me compared to ESFJs. Most of the ESFJs I know are on the go all the time and are constatnly connecting with other people. Also do you prefer a small group of close friends or large group of acquaintiences?\n\nThis is also a good thread with the differences between the two. \n\n[https://www.personalitycafe.com/sjs-temperament-forum-overseers/1171186-esfj-vs-isfj.html](https://www.personalitycafe.com/sjs-temperament-forum-overseers/1171186-esfj-vs-isfj.html)
3	I found myself certain that I was an ISFJ after I read about the inferior functions - inferior Ne was something I immediately related to, as opposed to inferior Ti.  Do you think your Ne is inferior or your Ti?
5	How do you deal with Goodbyes?	So, in a couple of months I will be changing jobs and I'm really struggling with the fact that I will have to say goodbye to my work colleagues/friends. I have always been bad with goodbyes, it makes me extremely sad when certain stages of my life are over and I have to change environments and people. I never know what to say and if I say something I end up choking up/crying. I would like to know if anyone else here is like this and how do you deal with it, thanks!
9	Goodbyes are hard and emotional for people I like. It's like ripping the bandaid off, I just get it over with.\n\nSlightly tangential, I *hate* goodbyes at parties. Not because I get emotional but because I don't know what to say. I'm getting better because I know it's rude, but in college I would almost always Irish-goodbye because I couldn't stand it.
4	i often feel sad when i think about it but strangely when i'm in the moment, it's pretty chill. however, i feel sad after too. i find that writing thank you/gratitude notes are helpful. 
2	For me personally,  If I like that person and I have to say goodbye it would be extremely hard. However if I don't like that person,  I will wouldn't even care to say goodbye to them. 
2	I switched from second shift to first shift at work, and it was very tough at first!! I had great relationships with a lot of colleagues that I didn't want to lose. I found the goodbyes quite difficult honestly. But over time, I made new relationships.
2	I kind of avoid goodbyes. It’s easier for me to just be gone and that’s it. I recently had to say goodbye to my mother, as she moved halfway across the country, and it broke my heart. Definitely cried.
3	Personality types and underwear types? (x-post /r/mbti)	Hello there.\n\nI did a bit of research on that topic, but didn't find anything meaningful (searched through google scholar).\n\nI was wondering if I could find correlation (and perhaps causation) from psychological types to the type of underwear worn.\n\nHere's the [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Q0O9FFHmOZKay1ztg9g39iEsP9gjGIYwejsnFrjGZ9Y/edit).\n\nFeel   free to comment on those questions aswell (with your MBTI type   identified) if you want. I figured this sort of survey would be okay   since there was a fetish survey a week ago on [/r/MBTI](https://www.reddit.com/r/MBTI). Hope it's alright!
14	No. Just no.
3	I filled it out, although I'm not entirely clear on why you need this information 😂
1	Isfj - thongs 
1	Wouldn’t it be more related to your body type or what you can afford. I’ve tried boxers but just hate how they ride up my leg, I’ve tried Kmart brands and even Calvin Klein and still felt the same. So I just stick with briefs and they’ve done me well
18	ISFJ's, what are some things your SO does for you that help you when you're feeling down?	
21	I guess for me, I find that just generally being in her presence usually helps if I'm feeling down or anxious.  I might try to talk at some point, but usually not until I've had time to process my feelings and figure out why I'm feeling the way I'm feeling.  Until then, cuddling up quietly on the couch and watching tv or reading is usually a good start.  I hope this helps!
13	I've been with my SO (an INTP) for nearly 3 years. I often get anxious when faced with uncertainty, but he's a great listener and he always offers a new perspective whenever I feel overwhelmed. He'll even help me think of new plans, and he contributes when he can (ex: he helped me with some coding for my thesis when I ran into problems). He also knows when to make me take a breather from work, so we'd often go out to eat or watch an episode of one of our shows. Even just making me laugh helps a lot.\n\nNow that we're long distance he can't do much in terms of doing activities together, but I think the most important thing that he's done for me has been giving me the peace of mind to know that I don't have to do everything on my own.\n\nHope this helps!
8	Honestly, the best thing he does is just give me lots of hugs and let me vent/talk/cry it out. \n\nOnce I'm feeling a tiny bit better (or when I'm a snotty, tearful mess), he starts cracking dumb jokes, and that always works. He can make me laugh even when I feel awful.
9	Rubs my back, asks me about how I am doing while giving me the space to talk and emote, offers to do household chores for me that I am anxious about (I do all the emotional labor in our household), allows me to be lazy, maybe gives me some space to relax and do something I enjoy. For me that would be watching TV/movies while crafting (needlepoint, embroidery, etc.). Of course my SO rarely does these things when I am in a bad mood because he is often also in a bad mood (INTP). ;) Just wishful thinking! 
6	So many SOs here are INTPs! My husband tested as one too, even though he seems to me to be the more ambiverted ENTP type :) Still, I think that is really interesting.\n\nI had a bad day today. He brought me ice cream (also I'm pregnant with cravings) and cuddled me as we watched a movie. He's funny as heck, a large reason why I married him. Cuddles, humor, helping me see the other side of things, and ice cream are the ingredients of best hubby and a bad day turned good :) 
5	listens, gives me food, lots of hugs and kisses. anything i ask of him :) but he just tries to be there for me and not let me dwell on it
3	Generally sit next to me and listen. Maybe hold my hand and rub/stroke it. Her being an INTP makes understanding feelings difficult for her. She would rather solve the problem, which I get. It's just not very calming, and she's really good about that. Sometimes it's good to get a grounded perspective, too. I think being there for me is largely that. \n\nCoddling me doesn't make me feel any better. It makes me feel like the person doing the coddling is either feeling guilty or condescending. In either case, the comfort they are attempting is insincere. Being sincere is big for me. I'm so glad I have that with her.
7	who?
2	I have a tendency to bottle up negative feelings because i feel guilty for sharing them, but my ESTJ has been encouraging me to open up about them more. When I'm feeling down over something unreasonable (worrying about what other people think, being scared to change jobs, etc) he helps me work through the anxiety by talking through it.\n\nIf it's just a bad moodswing or if that doesn't work, he just holds me and listens.\n\nDepending on my mood he'll hug me until I feel better or he'll encourage me to go on a walk or drive with him, or even just to go home, take a bath, and curl up in bed. Idk how he picks up on what I need so quickly, but he always seems to know how to help and I'm honestly lucky to have him. He's amazing.
2	My partner (INFJ) is wonderful about actively listening to me as I work through my problem/day out loud, if I am worked up or feeling frustrated. More often than not, I am able to coach myself through hard times that way, and reach a good resolution/conclusion basically by myself, but it means to world to me that he is willing to be a sounding board. He is also always willing to give his honest take on the issue, so I know he isn’t coddling me, but treating me and the situation with respect, which is also crucial. \n\nIf I’m feeling particularly depressed, his Ni picks up on it, will ask me what I need, and always respects my answer. If I need quiet, time to myself, a walk, his help with chores, whatever. He is always game to give me the kind of space or time that I want/need. \n\nSometimes he picks up on my down feelings a little too much, that it actually affects how *he* is feeling (that INFJ sponge...). Sometimes that ends up working in our favor, though, because I am able to provide some nurturing/caregiving that makes me feel so useful and needed, which in turn can take me out of my own head and make me feel productive and helpful. =)
2	If I’m up for chatting, they will let me vent. Comfort and reassure me, but also help me to move on from the issue/take my mind off from it. \n\nSupport me in whatever I feel like doing to get my mind off things but might not have the motivation to do (ie go workout with me). \n\nSnuggle me, kiss me, generally give me love and affection (I swear this is a cure for all things. It’s like a safety/happy blanket). Give me a massage. \n\nMake me laugh, help me to relax and chill out. \n\nTell me I am wonderful, appreciated and loved. 
1	Not a flipping thing .... sigh
9	Coping with death and loss?	Hi. I'm a 20 y/o ISFJ struggling with what's established in the title. My whole life I've been through plenty of loss, enough to think I'd be used to it by now even though I'm still young, but I still spiral into emotional breakdowns and catastrophizing at the thought of the inevitable: my loved ones dying.\n\nWhat gets me really quick is thinking about my pets dying, and how theyll surely die before I do, and it hurts so bad to even think about that I regret owning them and setting myself up to get attached and have to let it go, and ive almost nearly sworn off owning another cat after my childhood cat died. \n\nOther things are similar, like thinking about how my parents are going to die way before me, and I haven't even ruled in accidents yet. Thinking about my friends/partner dying makes me wish I never attached myself to people in the first place even though without them I wouldnt be who I am today and of course I love them. \n\n\nDoes any other ISFJ out there feel this? I struggle with anxiety so it might be worsened by that but I'm wondering if it's a common problem and if so, what makes it such a common problem. \n\nDeep down I know the answer to coping with loss is to just learn to accept that it's unavoidable but that never helps, only makes me more frustrated and upset and scared. 
3	I feel the same way. \nI have two cats who I love dearly, yet I think about them passing away almost daily. \nDo they know how much I love them?\nAm I doing enough for them?\nHumans have the unfortunate gift of knowing we will die, while animals don’t. \nMaybe we should be happy they know nothing about death. Only love. \n\nOne thing I’ve told myself is to never take a day with them for granted. Give them tons of love and affection. Then when they do pass, you’ll know you gave them everything you had.\n\nSame goes for my family. My mom is getting older and I have panic attacks thinking about her passing. Especially since my dad is no longer alive, I dread the thought of being an adult orphan. I don’t really have any advice for you.. because I don’t know how to deal with it myself. Just know that I think it’s normal. Death is unfortunately inevitable. But we shouldn’t waste too much of our lives thinking about it. \nMaybe I should take my own advice huh 🤷🏼‍♀️
2	I can empathise with how you feel. I used to panic at the thought of loss of family and friends in a very similar way to you. Then in 2015, my father and grandparents all passed away. It has been a long road, but what comforts me most and I am a ISFJ like you, is knowing that we are all part of a bigger picture. As long as you are doing the best you can to love and care for those close to you in the moment, like I know you do and that you know you do. That is the main thing. \n\nWhen I say bigger picture, being intuitive isn't my strong point unless under stress. Grief can trigger stress. The comfort I feel is knowing that our very being and our loved one's being also is linked, we comes from this planet and all that is around us. We are made up of the past in our genetics. We carry our family with us all the time. We share the same building blocks as our friends. Because of this, our family, friends and us will also be there in the future. We might not be seen, but we have been and parts of us will change into new things. We are part of a bigger picture, like a little piece in a huge puzzle. \n\nOur grief shows we care, and worrying about grief shows our care also. But just remember, your loved ones will always be there, in one form or another. And you have the strength and love to carry on for them and yourself also.
2	Oh wow holy shit I'm exactly the same way. The only thing I can say to help you is that the bond and love you will share with your pets and loved ones is worth the pain of loss, and I know just how bad it can hurt. 
2	I’m the same way. I experienced my first loss through my ex girlfriend who I’ve invested so much into only for her to leave me. It hurt so bad that i thought I would never be normal again. I don’t know how it would feel to lose someone again and if I’ll be better equipped to handle it in the future (I’d like to think that i can handle it much better now given what i has gone through). But I think that investing your energy into other relationships that you have / finding something else to do / building other relationships can help get you through the loss. 
1	I struggle with this too, with my family. Today I became anxious because my husband went to get the oil changed in the car. My mind raced to terrible things that can happen on the road. It doesn't help that I am so visual. I see it and that just makes it worse because the impression sticks around for awhile. \n\nI worry about my parents and sister constantly, it annoys them. I get told to relax a lot.\n\nI don't have a good strategy to cope because this is obviously an area for growth for me too. Maybe try to not surround yourself with other worriers if possible. Try to distract yourself / focus on the present moment when those images pop up. Be grateful, and let them know you love them. \n\n
28	What awesome characteristic of ISFJs have you observed to be overlooked?	I absolutely LOVE being an ISFJ and it frustrates me to see people overlooking/bullying/belittling us. Like, somehow we’re reduced to being these boring emotional balls of cookie-baking law abiding citizens who cower at conflict and confrontation. I mean, we are ngl but people make it seem as if we’re crippled by these characteristics of ours and can’t be anything more. \n\nFor example, ISFJs are emotional, yes, but we have an understanding of emotions that other people don’t have as strongly, and it allows us to understand ourselves better as well as the people around us. Our understanding of emotions helps us communicate with others better and resolve problems quicker. Idk about you guys but I have a way with “rationalizing my emotions” (i think it’s the Fe-Ti combo) and that helps me keep collected during pressing times and people go to me when they have problems because i can cut through the emotions they feel and find the root of their problems. \n\nALSO i feel like a lot of people are ISFJs but because the “ISFJs are boring” schtick they don’t realize this. Aaggh it just frustrates me a lot. \n\nISFJs are smart, great at communicating, BOSS BITCHES, and just all around an amazing type. I wish more people realize this. What about you guys, what do you think? \n\n
17	As a type, you are not generally associated with intelligence. I think this is a pity, because the ISFJs I know tend to have very smart ideas and are simply overlooked. :) (I know that smarts and personality are separate, but a bias can cause people to over-look intelligence they wouldn't otherwise.)
14	I feel like we're a lot more open-minded than other people give us credit for.  After I was typed as an ISFJ by a few different sites, and read through the functions to find that I agreed with them, I was shocked to see the ISFJ stereotypes that I feel barely applied to myself, and to other ISFJ's I've known.  The thing that bothered me (and this isn't just for ISFJ's - more xSxJ's in general,) is how I saw people saying that we're "glued to our ways" and making fun of us for our supposed refusal to change our ideas.  It seems that many people in the MBTI community seem to dislike ISFJ's (which I'm sure does attribute to a lot of people who enjoy MBTI being ENTP's, INTP's, INTJ's, and other xNxx types,) because they feel that we are judgmental and not open-minded... as an individual, I disagree with this stereotype.  I think that I'm a fairly open-minded person, and I think that the ISFJ's I've met are too.  Yes, it is true that we like doing things that we know have worked out before, but I am entirely willing to accept a new concept or change in the world if I feel that it will benefit society as a whole. I am willing to listen to different view-points, simply because I think that everyone's opinion matters, and I want to grow to understand them.  And I am not the only ISFJ who is like this - I have met many others who are like this, as well.\n\nThe thing is that we are all living in the Information Age.  I know that many people judge xSxJ's because of their own parents, but every individual has a large amount of access to information.  Perhaps ISFJ's in the past really were more stuck to their ways, but I don't think that most of us are like that anymore - I think that we're learning more about the world, and coming to accept different ways of living than we might have in the past, because this is a different world.  If I were alive in 1952, I believe that I would be a very different person - I very well may have been stuck in my ways, based on what society happened to believe.  But as the world grows and changes, people are growing and changing, and I believe that at this point in history, many xSxJ's are more accepting than we might have been in the past.
12	This is adorable. ISFJs are my favorite type. The type I get along with best, and the type I have the longest, most stable relationships with. (Obviously, I married one lol!)\n\nHere are some things I've noticed about my ISFJ spouse, bffs, MIL, etc.\n\n- Highly intelligent. Most of the ISFJs I'm close to have gone to ivy leagues, and-or have a doctorate. This speaks for itself. I just laugh when people think ISFJs aren't intelligent. Really?\n\n- High emotional intelligence. ISFJs are the most emotionally intelligent people I've ever met. They can and often do "read people like a book," which is why I'm not surprised many of them mistype themselves as INFJs. (Though personally I've noticed ISFJs are consistently accurate in their perceptions than INFJs because they don't assume.) I was drawn to my husband in the beginning because he was not only the funniest person I've ever met, but could also read me without speaking. It was intriguing. \n\n- Humble. Unlike other types however, they're very reserved about themselves, what they know, and what they've accomplished. I think this is why others sell them short, but personally, I admire this lovely trait about them.\n\n- Good leaders. Because of the above, they can be great leaders if they want to be, and sometimes I see them step up to the plate if it's necessary. But for the most part, they usually prefer working behind the scenes, where most people don't notice. I feel like I'm one of the few actually paying attention.\n\n- Open minded. This one trait is why I get along with them so well. I've met many people who say that they're open minded, but ISFJs truly are. Sure, they may be hesitant if they've never encountered things before, but that's normal. I like how even though they're hesitant, they're willing to try things out before discarding it.\n\nI could go on but then this would be an essay lol. 
7	I think my problem-solving abilities are one of my favorite qualities that I can attribute at least partially to my personality type! I’m great at evaluating what’s working and what isn’t and figuring out solutions to keep things running more smoothly. Even in my personal life, I spend a lot of time looking at how I can make myself better, and I attribute a lot of my personal growth to my skill in evaluating problems and finding solutions. 
7	I'm not sure if this applies to other ISFJs, but I'm very passionate about many things and i feel people don't always see just how much passion I have. So probably that. 
6	I think ISFJ can be good analysts without sacrificing people skills
5	I think people overlook our analytical abilities. As you said with tertiary Ti, we can have a bit of analytical streak counter to our auxilary Fe nature. Also, I hate how some N's tend to automatically think they are smarter than we are. Just because we are more here and now doesn't make us less intelligent. Sensors are just more detail-orientated, more practical, and better at putting things into our society to keep it moving. While N's tend to be better at seeing the bigger picture of a concept, making connections, and predicting what might happen. 
5	Thank you for this post! I entirely agree, and I think any person who has taken the time to click with me in person would agree. My friendship is a slow burn, haha. It starts out by talking to the "boring but sweet girl" but then they get to know the real me and figure out that I'm weird and fun just like everyone else. :)\n\nI also like to think that my empathy makes me better at realizing when I'm being an asshole and apologizing or doing what it takes to repair things. A lot of people get stubborn or defensive if they're called out, and I definitely understand that urge, but being able to see beyond a kneejerk reaction is important.
5	you're absolutely right. can't agree more. I'm also great at drawing lmao not that it has anything to do with this. thanks for this post. you're right. I feel like people think of me as the boring girl, but that's not right. fortunately my family recognize my playful personality lmao.\n
5	I also really appreciate this post. I find it so fascinating how small the engaged ISFJ community is, and therefore how much discussion/appreciation/connecting we lack, despite the fact that we are, supposedly, the most common type. Where is the love?!?\n\nI love that we can be detail-oriented, and analytical, without sacrificing tact or the understanding of how important the emotional side to any relationship/situation/experience is. Furthermore, I think we are among the most emotionally aware (both of ourselves and of others) and thoughtful. While our initial impulse in the face of frustration, conflict, or exhaustion may be to respond emotionally, we are highly aware of how emotional we are being, and can often do the work to understand why we are being so, so that we can resolve and move on in a more productive and pragmatic manner. Pair that awareness with the fact that we are chronic self-improvers, and you will often find ISFJs with a emotional comprehension and control well beyond their years. \n\nThanks again for kicking off this conversation! =)\n\n\n\n
3	Me too! The ISFJ descriptions are truly terrible. And, I've noticed people who write about ISFJs and cognitive functions still get it wrong and cling to the traditional mother / grandmother image. \n\nI always felt I was good at analysis, coding AND empathy. Not the best at either, but a happy mixture of both, and because of my insane attention to detail I am accurate in my assessments and find others mistakes. Also, I have four degrees, because learning is fun. So, the trait that ticks me off the most is when sites say something to the effect of "someone has to do the boring detailed work." Hogwash. Give me that and I'll quit, I need challenge, a lot of it.\n\nAlso, my memory sucks. Why does everyone say ISFJs have good memories? I think in impressions but I don't remember them. I just remember processes but never details. Impressions aren't details lol, they're like water color paintings. \n\nEither I'm mistyped, Myers Briggs is bull, or everyone has ISFJs wrong leading to a massive misunderstanding of a wonderful type. All three very possible.
6	Getting to know an ISFJ	Hi there,  \n\n\nI'm an ENFP and I recently started talking to an ISFJ. She's amazing and really likes me, but is super hesitant to move forward and give more time to me because according to her, I don't know her too well. I'm so used to just divulging everything about myself to everyone I know, that I'm not used to learning other people / figuring other people out for myself. She'd really like it if I get to know her better, but I really don't know where to start.   \n\n\nI feel like I'm caught in this catch-22 where I have to spend time with her to get to know her, but she'd rather give time to her friends because she trusts her friends more, so as a result I don't really know her too well, so I can't show that I'm trustworthy/reliable/naturally receptive to who she is, and the cycle continues.   \n\n\nI'm also really poor at figuring people out / predicting their behavior, so I need like a people-101: How do you get to know someone from the ground up? I've literally resorted to brainstorming everything she's told me and writing it down on a sheet of paper because I literally don't know how to organize information in my brain. 
8	Well, with the information you’ve said here, it looks like you may need to find a niche for yourself in her life- like a class/hobby she already does that you can join to anchor your schedule to hers without asking her to disrupt her life. \n\nWith that said- that’s a super weird thing to say to a person you are interested in developing a relationship with. It kind of sounds like she might not be interested in cultivating a relationship right now. Like, that’s the kind of shitty af excuse I would be tempted to use to turn someone down. 
3	it really takes time for us to warm up as an isfj. If i have a couple of trusted friends well that's enough for me and I dont need to "go out" and find another friend. Sometimes, we dont invest much in people ( i mean not all).\n\nGetting to know an isfj really takes a lot of effort and time . Thats because we want to make sure that this person we just met is trusthworthy
1	Fe>Ni=Ne>Si>Ti>Fi>Te>Se: Am I an ISFJ?	My functions stack is Fe>Ni=Ne>Si>Ti>Fi>Te>Se. What is my MBTI type? According to 16 personalities and human metrics I am an INFJ.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n&#x200B;
2	Dichotomies: INFJ\nCognitive functions: ENFJ
1	I don’t think taking a test to determine your type is the best way to decide what type you are. Maybe provide a description of yourself, particularly, your thinking process, how you interact with others, your work habits, and how you act when you’re stressed. From there maybe we can figure out which type fits you :) 
52	Bingo, Anyone? What do you agree with/disagree with and why?	
15	I don't agree with the dry humor. I think I have more of a goofy sense of humor. I also feel like I don't care as much as I should sometimes. I also don't volunteer that much and that is something I should do more of. The rest of those I agree with to some extent. 
7	Pretty much all of these apply to me. Expressing my emotions just totally depends on the person and situation. I tend to repress/ignore things that only slightly bother me, or things that involve people I don’t know very well. However, I’d say I’m pretty good about discussing feelings with people I’m very close with, especially if I think it’s a big deal. 
6	Male ISFJ here. I don't agree with the good memory. The below is probably way too specific to me. I am terrible at remembering precisely what someone tells me, which to me means my memory isn't very good. However I can usually remember where something is after seeing it once in passing. I also will more remember the tone of a conversation but not what was actually said. It would be more accurate to say sentimental, or good spacial memory. At least from my experience.\n\nIt's cool to see how people are evaluating this post in their comments. I'm surprised at how I can relate and strangely encouraged.
6	Bingo
4	i think it’s unusual for me, but i don’t like to spend time with much of my family. only my dad. Even then I prefer to be alone most of the time, and sometimes with my friends. 
4	Doing over thinking doesn’t apply to most ISFJs I know. They may do a lot but they also overthink and can be notorious procrastinators with some things. 
2	It's a bingo for me
2	Yeah. I'm all of them.
2	I got all of them. What do I win?
2	Ooh, blackout! 
1	Bingo minus the good memory 
23	Freezing in conflict situations	Does anyone experience this "freezing" when in an argument or otherwise tense social situation?\nI find that my brain goes on lockdown and I can't really say anything to defend myself.\n(And of course I come up with great things to say after the situation has passed...) \n\nThis really annoys me and I was wondering if its common for ISFJs and if theres any ways you've been able to make it better? 
8	I don't know if it's common for ISFJs, but I'm the same.
6	I agree!!!! completely.
4	Yes, always happens to me. I think of perfect responses before or after, but definitely freeze if I have to respond quickly. 
3	Yes I feel this.. especially when being criticized by authority figures in my life. I get overwhelmed and panicky and then go too deep inside my own head and can’t comprehend what the other person is saying anymore.
3	YESSS. My biggest problem.\n\nWhen confronted, when in tense situation, when someone throws tantrum, when someone has an outburst, when I'm asked to speak up in tense situations, when criticized, when I'm hurt, when someone flirts with me too (sometimes, like when IDK them properly) or gives me too much attention and IDK them that well.\n\nPeople close to me get very annoyed with the way I go blank\n\n&#x200B;
2	This only happens when I’m about to be assaulted 
2	Yes this happens. Or when I’m in an argument I feel not only the blood pressure rise but my sub conscious wanting to say something hurtful but bite my inner tongue. Then yes the recourse of going shut I should have said x and done x or a combination of both.
2	Yes!!
2	Yess!! I start to sometimes take on everyone’s emotions. 
2	Yep. Happened to me today. Usually I have a response, but it's a picture in my head. There's no time to translate to words, especially when the other person uses words so effortlessly. I end up looking and feeling very dumb. 
2	Yep totally experience this. I too end up feeling stupid (which is the worst feeling), and then get mad at myself for that, and then just get mad in general. \n\nMy advice is to just try and walk away, not let whatever it is bother you. It’s very hard to do, but I’m working on it 
9	Would you consider yourself a dog person or a cat person?	Fellow isfj and Im definitely cat leaning. The low maintenance and quieter/chiller vibes work for me. I'd imagine it might be a mix bag, just curious. 
10	I barely consider myself a person :D\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDog for me tho I think, cats are fine too tho.
4	Dog person, for sure! I like having a lot of interaction and staying active with my doggo. 
4	Dog person. My dog gets me outside every day but is also good company on the days I don't want to socialize with other people.
3	This is such a hard question for me. I'm an animal person. If I had to choose I would say dog person but I love cats so much too.
3	cat
2	The correct answer is both! 
2	I like older cats that are calm and don’t need constant attention. I like older dogs that like to play but don’t need constant care. Dogs are better for hugging and cuddling. Cats can be too much for me. \n\nAt the end of the day I’m a dog guy. 
2	I love both equally, but I'm more likely to get a dog.
2	Originally a cat person, but have become a dog person too in the last couple years. 
2	I'm no doubt a cat person. I like dogs, but cats are just so much cuter. 
2	Crazy catlady here. But I grew up with dogs as well, so I like them too most of the time.
2	Cat. Dogs are a bit too interactive for my liking right now. Ideally I would have one of each so they can keep each other company when I'm being a hermit. 
1	Dog person, but I have cats because of reasons. We coexist and I think we give each other appropriate amounts of attention. 
1	Both.
1	Definitely dog. I’m not a big fan of cats. They seem selfish and angry
1	How can I (INFJ woman) attract an ISFJ man?	
7	Show him that you're interested, make the first move - these guys are usually somewhat quiet & shy.  Try to dress nice but not overtly sexy. Go out to a movie or dinner date with them. Don't be argumentative or manipulative, they don't like that. 
3	Send me your number! LOL. In all seriousness, as an ISFJ male I would actually be more comfortable with a lady who just asks me out, sometimes more than once, because I'm dense about those things. And I'm TOTALLY OK with a lady making the first move, unless I think you're playing a trick on me, because that never really happens to me. 
2	ISFJs, how do you feel about practical jokes?	Do you like pranking your loved ones? Do you like it when they prank you?
17	Hate them. So much. When they’re done against me and when they’re done against other people. I’m also an only child, so that might play into it too. 
4	I really really don't like pranks. They make me anxious and uncomfortable and it's also really hard to gauge if someone's going to be upset or inconvenienced by a particular prank. I'd just prefer to stay away from them.
3	I’m not an ISFJ, but my mom is and she has firmly stated how much she dislikes practical jokes many times. She’s got a good sense of humor, but she finds practical jokes to be offensive and definitely not funny. Now I’m wondering what type would like them. My best guess would be an E**P? 
3	I hate them. April Fool's Day is my most dreaded day of the year. I am very self-conscious about being the butt of a joke, especially in public.
3	Oh I HATE pranks! Just makes me annoyed and embarrassed. 
3	I dig em. Didn’t expect all the hate haha
2	I love scaring/pranking my sisters but that's it. I hate when people play weird mind word games with me I dont think it's that funny, I do scare easily and dont mind that sometimes cause it can be funny.
2	I looooove practical jokes, pranks.. be it me playing the prank or being pranked :D\n\n&#x200B;
1	I like them!
1	Practical jokes were an acquired taste. My younger brother by 1.5 years was a relentless teaser and joker. He has since mellowed out. We are in out 20s.
3	Would you say Ted Mosby from HIMYM is an ISFJ?	I would, although I've seen him typed as both INFJ and INTJ online. A lot of people don't seem to like him very much though, which I kind of understand, but honestly I find him to be very similar to myself so I do actually enjoy his character. (I'm only at the end of season 2 so far.) Thoughts?
6	I think he's infj. He is too idealistic and awkward to be isfj. 
4	He seems like an inmature INFJ for me. ISFJs are more loyal and steady. He changes his reasonings all the time, also.
2	I find him insufferable. I don’t think he’s sensing at the end of the day. 
1	Yeah I think he is either an ISFJ or INFJ. I think he is more of INFJ though because that whole series was about his vision of his life with mother and kids. But he could also be an ISFJ because he does recall the store in great detail. Not sure if an INFJ would do that.
3	What is it like to have an INFJ SO?	Does the Si-Ne/Ni-Se difference make it difficult for the partners to truly "connect" with each other?\n\nI get along really well with ISFJs (as friends). They really help me be more practical. However, I cannot have theoretical discussions with them which is a bummer. They take things too literally whereas I struggle with taking things at face value. Yet, our introversion and auxiliary Fe make us both value harmony + focus on pleasing our loved ones, which makes it easy for us to get along. I have always been curious what it would be like to date one...\n\n* I pulled this from a post on the INFJ sub*\n\n
6	Definitely a disconnect in communication as you said. However this is referencing my 30 year relationship with a family member. I find frustration lies the most in infj giving advice when it wasn’t requested (majority of the time), and the isfj fearing letting down infj because said advice wasn’t desired. I also find the infj gets snappy in an Se power play type way, but because it’s inferior it comes out like a child tantrum which is hard for me to handle. On the flip side my inferior Ne creates the inability to see alternatives which annoys infj. However now that I’m older and exercising my Ne I have a hard time committing to one linear path. \n\nOtherwise as you mentioned the Fe Ti saves us. That sounded more negative than positive, but I assure you there is plenty of love in the family relationship. 
7	Speaking from an INFJ perspective... ISFJs are warm and full of snuggles! :)
1	Yeah I have never had an INFJ SO. But I’m friends with an INFJ. I like them I find that we get along pretty well and both have solid Fe and Ti working together. However, it can be hard to keep up with her Ni sometimes and to understand it (I try my best to). I can definitely see some of the Se in her lmao. 
1	I am dating an isfj and I'm an infj.  We both like pleasing others so we have this plan one of us picks three things to do and then the other picks the one.  It's nice to have someone that cares asuch about others as I do.  We like to snuggle and watch TV.  Sometimes we go on dates, my favorite was a wine and paint.  We both like similar vehicles and turbos.  We both have steady jobs, but aren't concerned about fancy things.  
1	my dad is an infj, we have a great meaningful relationship. I truly look up to him. he's my hero.
3	Marit Larsen = ISFJ?	I really think one of my favorite musicians, Marit Larsen, is an ISFJ. Her songs are very Si-Fe heavy. \n\nExample:\n\n"I Can't Love You Anymore" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBdJSTPRifs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBdJSTPRifs)\n\n"Coming Home" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzfkxexhcQg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzfkxexhcQg)\n\n"What If?" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R18ypD\_de\_Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R18ypD_de_Q) \n\nWhat do you think?
2	I thought her voice sounded super familiar, looked her up, and found out she was part of M2M.  They were my jam when I was younger, haha.  I heard Marion on another album a few years ago, but I didn't know Marit was still making music.  
42	Depressed isfj_irl

11	Does anyone else ever feel like they give a lot more to their friendships than their friends do?	And then begin to silently resent it because you don't want to cause conflict or hurt somebody's feelings?\n\nI'm one of my only friends with a car and I also make more than a lot of my friends so I often end up driving everybody around and covering people for food if they don't have money, although people don't generally do the same back...\n\nI'm honestly usually happy to do it but sometimes I resent it because I see myself as the "responsible" one, and sometimes find myself judging other people's spending habits even though I don't want to (ie he just spent a bunch of money on weed and now that invite to the mall is clearly just so that they have someone to drive them there and not have to spend 2 hours on the bus, yet I know they're not going to give me gas money because they invited me to hang out... etc).\n\nI guess I'm also a bit of a people pleaser because I have a tough time saying no. I live in a town where the bus system is abysmal but a lot of young people don't drive, as well as there only being a lot of minimum wage jobs. Anyone else?
9	Yes. I've had to accept that I genuinely enjoy helping out more than others will ever think to help me. And resisting or refusing to help would make me feel unfulfilled. HOWEVER it does cross the line into being taken advantage of (which you describe!). The hardest thing for me is to differentiate the moments when I'm going to enjoy helping a friend and when i'm going to feel resentful about it. One thing that helped was identifying how my different friends show their appreciation/friendship in return. It might be in different ways than I do for them and therefore expect (acts of service). If a friend reciprocates in a different way or clearly isn't just keeping me around because i'm "nice" then its all good.\n\nI've slowly learned to avoid or deflect the situations that are truly going to make me feel taken advantage of. By deflect I mean, someone asks you do to something and you propose an alternative that works better for you (different day/time, different location). It's not a flat out "no" and shows their willingness to adapt to your preferences. \n
4	yes. And, I've given up, accepted that part of me..
4	Yes, absolutely.  Not even just my friends, but people in general.  The fact of the matter is that it's not healthy for me, but I just have such a hard time saying "no" without feeling bad.
2	yeah totally. it's almost sad how big the difference is.
1	RemindMe! 1 day
12	according to this scientific study...isfjs..?	according to this scientific study with brain scans isfjs are the most right brained out of all types.they also tend to learn better via visual stimuli...anyways in your experience would you isfjs say yoru right brained?,can you easily tap into intuition.and just know things out the blue..?what right brain things can you do really well?
4	I just did 10 different tests and sometimes the questions they use do not yield the same results.\n\n|Iteration|Left|Right|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Test 1|50|50|\n|Test 2|34|**66**|\n|Test 3|**63**|37|\n|Test 4|44|**56**|\n|Test 5|37.5|**62.5**|\n|Test 6|**60**|40|\n|Test 7|\-|**Preference**|\n|Test 8|50|50|\n|Test 9|10|**13**|\n|Test 10|**Preference**|\-|\n\nSo that's 5 out of 10 for right brain, 3 out of 10 for left and 2 out of 10 with balanced. I would assume right brain takes the lead.\n\nI believe the best right brain "things" I have are intuition and feelings (I'm an empath).\n\nI do learn better with examples and visual aid too.
4	You’d get this result with me!\nHowever I’ve expanded my learning by all aspects as I wanted to learn how others gather information. It has helped me in user experience design and putting things into perspective for everyone I need to instruct or gain input. \n\nPhotographic memory! It’s a little hazy at times but for the most part it’s eerie to my peers and family. Wife says I’m full of useful or useless knowledge... \n\nIntuition is a negative for me as I’ll usually come up with the worst case scenario and I tend to bury the excitement. I am learning not to dwell and just go with the moment unless I know for a fact the outcome will be bad.\n\nWeb and print design, programming (left), play guitar, draw, paint, wood working, cooking and baking, etc. 
4	right brain things? What do you mean? Oh wait I think I get it... I think that is right for me. I learn better most times via visual stimuli..  Wait I can't just learn things out of the blue.
3	I don't mean to be critical, but do you mind linking the study? Most studies I've seen about the 'left vs right brain' claims have indicated that it's more of a myth and in reality people don't really favor one side of their brain the way they would a hand or eye.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3743825/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3743825/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	ya.. I think my right brain has more weight in comparison to my left... 
6	How can we make this sub more active and meaningful?	
11	Post more often. Talk about different topics, not the typical personality type talk. Spice it up. 
2	I only stay subbed because I forget what type I am and I look through my list of subreddits when I need to remember. I go to /r/introvert, /r/empath or /r/socialanxiety for discussions.

4	Convincing an ISFJ, getting past the "conflict avoidant" traits.	So, I think my brother is an ISFJ (Like, I'm not an 100% certain, but he fits the description). He's currently failing in his studies, which in of itself, isn't a problem, everyone does that, and I did too...\n\n**The problem is more that his attitude is getting more and more dodgy :** \n\nHe avoids everything, blames his problems on other factor, he doesn't own up to anything. He's officially a NEET now, and well, beside passing time on his computer, he doesn't do much. \n\nIf you confront him, he will say that he's tired or something, and try to escape, or other similar excuses (2 years of this). I'm writing this now, he went to sleep but I can hear game sounds from his room. He also using his own bad sleeping habits as an excuse for more bad choices... \n\nNow, I get it, he dislikes that a lot. He said it himself. Ie, too much Ti, not enough Fe. From my POV, it's not like I pursue him or anything, I just don't buy his BS. I don't yell or anything, I'm basically just asking difficult questions (and not just the gotcha kind where the answer is in the premise)\n\n**He imitates me :** \n\nI'm 4 year older, not so much now, but a lot in the past, he imitated me. \n\nA good exmaple would be formation. Back in highschool, i choose a brand new formation called STI2D, which is kinda meant to form enginneer. That's on paper, I got fooled, in the end, you become some sort of tehcnicians, and you do what other people tell you. It was filled with idiots (we actually spent two months on how levers work because people pretended they didn't get it, where they simply weren't trying to listen or understand... 2months on fucking levers... The teachers made it simple, and they still managed to fail somehow.) \n\nLong story short, I dropped out, and managed to get my BAC as a free candidate and get back on track at uni. Right now, I'm in a Master, but I still lost 2 years.\n\nSo when it was time for him to make the same choice, I told him, multiples, just stay on the simpler path, choose ES (economique et social), the one with the most people on it. It's rather easy, you will be fine. \n\nWhere it's weird is that he choose this exact same STI2D formation. He even put it as his first choice, with ES in second. I told him not to do it, tons of time, he still did it. I don't get that at all, he literally had no reason to do that, and tbh, it was a very stupid mistake. Now, he admits it was a mistake. \n\nInsights into this would be appreciated, because I really don't get it... \n\nMaybe it was teacher pressure or something... \n\n**What I did so far :** \n\nUnlike my father/mother, and some "friends" I don't put pressure on him. I don't ask him thoses bs question about his plans or tell him he needs to get on it. That's counterproductive, you only get pre-made answers...\n\nIt's like a "-How are you ? - Fine" exchange...\n\nI don't sympathize too much eitheir tho, because it's kinda dishonest, he didn't really earn that sympathy eitheir. I also tried in the past, it didn't work at all. There's also that I'm an INTP, I dislike to do that shit. \n\nAlso, if the problem is that the group doesn't accept him, I, as an individual can't counterbalance that, no matter how much I try.  \n\nLike I said, I was in a similar NEET situation a few years ago, so I really get where he is right now, but I dunno, I completely assumed my choice, and it was relatively easy to get back on track. Using that experience, and just looking at his actions, I can see he's full of shit when he says he will change...\n\nSo when I talk to it with him, I try to get at the root of it. What does he want deep down ? If he doesn't get that himself, he won't make good choices/keep being lost. I guess it's too much Ti, because it always end up with him running away (still, I'm the only one irl that he talks so long with, anyway)\n\n**What others did :** \n\nPersonally, I know pressure doesn't work, it's actually a huge part of the problem. The more pressure you put, the less he does. Putting too much pressure will just push him to choice that aren't his own, so when he fails, well, it's not fault, now is it ? \n\nMy mom just insists that he works harder. My older brother, an ISTJ, is trying stuff out on his part, also arguably failing in his studies, but he is owning up to it. It's hard to contact him on my part, and I don't think he gets it eitheir... Not enough to give good advice or help him... \n\nMy (ISTP) dad did even really stupid things to force his hand, like putting him in some residence for young people with problems, as it would "teach him discipline", or taking away the computer because  he's "addicted to it". Dumb, dumb, dumb...  All that set us back a lot... \n\nMy dad also divorced my mom, and now is together with some SJ, with her life in good order and all that. (I actually think she's an ISFJ too) She has children of their own, and well, they are sucessful compared to us, so not only the comparaison pop up often, she also acts like she can give advice. Itt, more stupid, pointless pressure. \n\nSo yeah, I'm basically the only one... \n\n**What he's doing :** \n\nRight now, he's trying formations that are engineer-ish, on the same path of that STI2D formation he kinda faile (He did it to the end, earned his BAC, but he skipped so much that he has big holes in it, also, a terrible attendance record.)\n\nAs far as we (the family) are concerned, he is simply unsuited for thoses engineering formations. He tried a BTS last year (post-secondary education in 2years), and gave up pretty quickly. So the rest of the year, he did nothing, when time came to make a new choice for new school year, he basically insisted on continuing on that path even if we told him to try other stuff. Be it law or economics, or even a language formation. Nope, he just put the same stuff, got accepted in only one (a DUT, this one in 3years) ... Now 3 weeks in, he decided he would stop... \n\nI don't know why he's insisting on it where he would have better options elsewhere... He just doesn't listen to me, even when he answers and even agrees with me. \n\nI don't know why. Maybe he didn't considerall his options well enough. Maybe it's a form of pride. Maybe he just continuing on this out of habit, in a way... \n\nHe says it interests him, but well, it doesn't interest him enough to actually work on it or go to class, so we might as well say it doesn't. \n\nNow, he talks about changing, and doing something in informatics, but the same problems will occur, he will start, see he doesn't have the level of knowledge necessary, stop going because he feels bad about it, and thus his lack of knowledge will only increase, and he will have lost another year. That's it, if he's even accepted in it in the first place (Btw, we're in france. Higher education is more or less free, but they select the better student. With his current dossier, they will say he's not serious and et someone else)\n\nThat NEET thing is really a vicious circle, so he needs to get out ASAP. \n\nI won't say he's "depressed" or anything, I don't throw bs diagnostic like that around because I'm not a psychologist, but it certainly is getting to him too...\n\nWe are in october right now, so it's probably too late to salvage this year, but I want to do something now, because he's running out of option fast. If he fail to complete this yera of formation (even if he intends to change afterward), it will just leave another bad mark on his dossier/attendance record. \n\nYou guys are "responsible, loyal, realistic", and really, he's good at that stuff concerning others (like, he was very helpful at my cousin's recent marriage), but he fails to do apply the same standard to himself...\n\n***\nAnyway, my point is this. \n\n**How do I push/help him out of this ?** I don't want a direct solution, a miracle cure or anything, just that he owns up to his choice, because he's really running out of time and options. I'm also tired to cover up/lie to our mother on his behalf. \n\n* Of the stack, what should I focus on ? Fe ? To me, the solution was more that he confronts his problems, so Ne and Ti... \n* What kind of job/career really fit you guys ? And why ? Just saying what you do/have tried works for me, I don't want to rely on the shitty "best career for ISFJ" pages on the internet.\n* Is it actually depression ? Please don't use the term lightly too or play internet psychiatrists, but if you have insights because you were in a similar place, I will take it. 
9	Can someone please translate this wall of gibberish into English? It looks like they are trying real hard to sanitize any input on the matter, but I might just kirk out being American, "Respect commentator authority" and all that jazz.
4	There's no convincing, they just gotta figure that shit out on their own. Sometimes you gotta just take a step back because you cant change something that is so deep and never going to go away
2	This totally sounds like depression- it’s not really something you can help with. Maybe make a psychiatry appointment for him?

22	ISFJ x INFJ podcast!	Hey all! I (ISFJ) co-host a new podcast called This Much Love! with my partner (INFJ),and it’s now available on iTunes/Podcasts.app (also Spotify, if that’s your thing)\n\nWe wanted to make a show where we could channel our positivity, passion, and love for various things into 30-60 minute episodes. We hope it makes you happy, too (we could all use a bit more of that, huh?). Subscribe here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/this-much-love/id1437730010\n\nSomething that would mean a lot to us… If you like the show, could you leave a review? I know it’s tacky to ask, but it helps other people discover it on their own, and we don’t currently have the budget for a major marketing campaign. Word of mouth is key. ♥️
3	INFJ here! Listening to this on Spotify now and loving the positivity already! Thanks for sharing. :)
3	Loving this already. Nice to have something to listen to on my commute to work 
2	Will listen to it when I have the chance 
8	How do you guy's feel about romantic relationships? How many of you guy's are single because of trust issues?	I can only speak for myself,  but romantic relationships these days are pointless.  You see I work for a Union and  it consists of a lot of traveling,  In the back of my head I don't wanna be working my ass off and having someone behind my back screwing someone else . It's almost impossible to find someone to be faithful.  It's honestly like finding a needle in a haystack .. 
6	I had the shitty cheating ex who broke my trust. After him I met my now fiancé. I actually met him super fast after my bad breakup and was worried what people were going to say and think I was rebounding etc. But I just had such a strong gut feeling about him that I said screw it and gave it a shot. I had huge trust issues with him at first. He was pretty patient with me but finally after about 6 months said look, I’m not that guy and I never will be - you need to either give me the shot or I can’t do this. I didn’t want to lose him, so I worked hard on myself and trusting him. I still had my issues and it probably took me a year or so to feel like I could really trust the person that he is. \n\nI get it, so many people are shitty. My best advice is keep trying, but ALWAYS trust your gut instinct. \n\nEdit: I’ll also throw out their family helped me a lot. Cheating ex - it was always weird with his family. My fiancé now, it’s been comfortable with his and the way he was with them helped me learn to trust him easier. 
3	I also find relationships to be pretty pointless. I'd rather focus on my career and myself.
3	I'm married to an ISFJ woman and I was also her first boyfriend. From what she said about it, maybe you just have to really wait for the right person? She was just really focused on her studies and work before we met, but we hit it off and now here we are. (EDIT: To clarify: she still is really focused on that, but now she just has a relationship.) We still have some difficulties since our outlooks and concerns are so different, but over time they've actually complemented pretty well. \n\nTravel and distance are difficult, especially if it's a new relationship, but ya never know. Sometimes taking the risk of getting hurt pays off!
3	I was 21 before I got into any relationship... before I even got my first kiss lol. My now boyfriend jokes that I had high standards and a long checklist he had to go through before I ever deemed him “worthy” haha. Jokes aside, I think there’s some truth to what he said in that I put my relationship in a high regard, so if I see some indicator that a relationship might not work out with you, you’re automatically “not in the game” (i never really thought of it that way but i guess that’s what it seemed to other people whelp)\n\nUltimately, for me, if I can’t be friends with you, then we can’t pursue anything further than that. If I can’t joke around with you, if i can’t be vulnerable around you, if I can’t trust you, etc etc then I won’t bother pursuing a relationship with you. \n\nI’ve been with my boyfriend for more than a year now, our relationship had some difficulties at the beginning due to circumstances, but we got through that and we’re veeeryyy happy now :)
2	You can also try /r/mbtirelationships for further advice! 
2	This sounds exactly like how I'd imagine many ISFJs feel about relationships. God forbid they get in the way of good old fashioned work! And holy trust issues Batman! The paranoia is real!\n\nI don't mean to tease, I know all that comes from life experience. Still...Come play with us! You're too fun to work all the time! \n\n-An ENFP male
2	I am my happiest self in a relationship....and I’m not ashamed of that. So many people say “you should love yourself and be able to give yourself that happiness without a partner” and sure, you should love yourself and not RELY on someone else for worth. But the intensity of emotions I have while single are nothing compared to me being in love with someone; it’s literally life affirming. I feel like it’s my life’s purpose to love and nurture someone. It’s very important to me and so so rewarding. \n\nThat being said, it’s fucking hard. I wear my heart on my sleeve (despite trying so hard not to). If I connect well with someone and feel reciprocation, it’s impossible to stay ahead of my emotions. I have struggled most with falling for someone too fast, becoming needy and desperate (super frustrating since I consider myself to be highly independent and self sufficient), getting frustrated when they can’t give me straight answers or understand their own emotions and ultimately end up lashing out at them (completely counterproductive and likely a defense mechanism). Then I feel like shit about myself and want to apologize compulsively. \n\nI wouldn’t say I have trust issues—but then again I have never been cheated on explicitly. I am just generally drawn to xSxP types who have no idea what they want and who are wishy washy with commitment. It’s the best and worst thing. Every time I’m hurt from the above scenario, I swear I’m never doing that again. So that’s my only “trust” issue. But then inevitably I find myself in the same position in the future. Oh well. 
15	If someone here doesn't understand this, I give up :)	Fellow ISFJ's, I lost my perfect-for-me best friend (also an ISFJ; someone FINALLY understood me!!!) in February, and my heart feels torn to shreds. I don't want to give up hope that someone else can fill that spot in my heart, but it felt so perfect that I don't know how it could ever happen again.\n\nAnyone here looking for that soulmate kind of friend that so many of us crave so much? It seems like every time I try to get close to someone, they're too busy or they already have that friend and don't need another one.\n\nThought I'd come here with some hope to see if any of you have been looking for someone to connect with. Who knows? Maybe we've been looking for each other the whole time!!!\n\n(If this post breaks the rules, feel free to delete.)
6	I'm from a small town and attend a cliquey University - I too have found that it's really hard connecting with others when they're already in established friendships! There are people like me that are still searching though :)
3	Hit me up! I’m always up for deep connections and as someone who has also lost her best friend of ten years, I appreciate making new friends. I don’t believe that anyone can fill the gaps people leave when they leave as everyone is unique and we never really forget them. But we move on and meet other people to share life with and create new memories.
3	Yep. I haven’t had that super comfortable, together all the time kind of friend for almost 5 years, since I had a falling out with my former best friend. I have a nice group of friends but I miss having that one person who’s always there and always gets me. 
1	I found my soulmate friend in college.. I don’t know what her type is, but conversations with her are the most rewarding. We live in separate states though and don’t talk more than once a month. I haven’t found any girlfriends in my new state that I’ve connected with on the same level. I have met some cool people, but I wish I had a best friend out here. I have it better than my boyfriend though.. it’s so hard for guys to make friends.
1	I too am in the same boat! Im a bit picky who I give my time to so they have to be a special someone to really call a close friend. Also recently moving to another state doesn’t help. :/
1	If what your looking for is just ISFJs, statically there a lot of them.  
1	same bro..
1	My brothers girlfriend is a fellow ISFJ and all 3 of us are very close so Im lucky to be to relate to her\n\n
1	Yes, I know this feeling deeply. Still putting myself out there and trying to meet people -- have not met my "friend-mate" yet, but she must be out there. Here are two of my previous posts:\n\n[Don't Want to Bother People](https://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/2j5dbn/i_dont_want_to_bother_people_no_matter_how_much_i/)\n\n[Revealing True Self](https://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/35gun1/revealing_your_true_self/)\n\nI have acquaintances and people I talk to from work, my boyfriend's friends, ladies from my Zumba class... but no one I can talk to deeply.\n\nGood luck, and do not give up. I have not yet and it is not always easy but you just have to keep going.\n\nYou can message me if you ever need, and best of luck to you!
1	Yes I’m looking!!! I had a falling out with my best friend/roommate a few years back then moved 2,000 miles away. We recently reconnected and I love her to bits, but long-distance just isn’t the same:( I haven’t made any real friends since being here- just coworkers and acquaintances. \n\nI did meet a guy that I’m currently dating but he’s an INTP and the connection definitely isn’t the same!! (BFF is an INFP) I’m hoping to meet someone I can connect with like I did with her, but I’m not counting on it tbh. 
6	How to help my ISFJ wife with her existential crisis?	My wife (age 31) is going through an existential crisis since few weeks after she started a new job 1 month ago. The current and previous job are both in quality assurance. But the new job as twice much work and stress according to her and she is not equipped with high degree of computer skills that the new job requires. The job change was a result of her parents expectations for her to progress more. The colleagues and boss are all nice but extroverts and she cannot make short talk so she is silent all day and feeling isolated. A temporary worker who joined alongside her is charming everyone while she is finding it difficult to concentrate, understand and deliver on the expectation arising from that she already have five years of experience. The result is that she is crying everyday and burying herself in self-doubt. According to her, she is disappointing everyone at work.  She is trying to work extra hard but she is saying that she is not learning. She is also thinking that she will get fired, which in my opinion is impossible. She is quite depressed and thinking about changing career to more practical work like biomedical analyst, which according to her does not require to come up with new ideas and leading at work. This would require three years of study. In all of this, i have to be away for work on a 2 week basis for a total of four months. She has assured me that she will be in touch with her friends.\n\nAny advise from you will be useful.  As ISFJs how long have been your crises? How do you get over them? 
10	Hi, sorry to hear your wife isn't enjoying her new job. One thing I would say is that as ISFJ's we like to a) put loads of pressure on ourselves b) want to know something inside out before we give it a go, which isn't always the case with a new job.\n\nI hated my last job for some similar reasons - long hours, too much work, crazy pace, disorganised, major emphasis on being extroverted and an amazing presenter (which I'm not). I struggled to progress too as I felt like I didn't fit in/didn't want to sacrifice my life to the company for the sake of getting ahead which seemed to be what you needed to do.\n\nIt gave me a major existential crisis where I was basically going to drop out of my career and be a dog walker or something. I hated it from the first week but stuck it out for 2 years as we were planning on moving house.\n\nWithin a month of moving house I'd applied for a new job and got the hell out of there. I've never looked back, I've been promoted in my new job within a year and I'm making more money working much less hours. I will say it still took me 6 months or so to really get my bearings and find my footing with my job so maybe your wife is being hard on herself, I always find it takes a while not to feel like a newbie. \n\nTell her to take lots of notes, make sure she organises her workload as well as she can, ask clarifying questions as often as she needs to, put stuff in emails if she needs a record, ask other people for help when she needs it. If she needs more training in the computer side of things then she needs to ask for it (even if it's from a colleague rather than a manager) or maybe take the time to learn it in her spare time. "I can't do it" isn't always acceptable at work.\n\nYou need to be supportive of her decisions. I was totally whiny during the job I hated, and it interfered with life away from work, which annoyed my husband and made him snippy about my job too. This wasn't that helpful but I will say he was very supportive of me taking the time to fill in applications etc which was helpful.
4	**tl;dr:** The pressure is mostly self-made. Be open, honest, show that you care and it will get better. Experiencing positive feedback and achievements will build optimism.\n\n**wall of text:**\n\nI am in similar position in the sense that I am working at a new company get thrown into many projects on short notice and need to work on things I have no or little experience with. It makes me really uncomfortable to not be good and confident with the tasks that are asked from me.\n\nBeing in my third month now I noticed that people are always surprisingly appreciative of my work even if I sometimes have to ask for help, I feel slow and on a few occasions I had to say that I can't do something. I tend to think of me as a liability because I am not perfect but it's just not true and the people know that I can't do everything and are usually happy when I ask for help. The alternative is that somebody finds out that I tried on my own and failed when it is too late.\n\nMy company is in tech and I have no idea how supportive line managers are in other companies. Here they are really trying to help me do my job well. I would try to be open about the problems and ask for advice how to deal with it.\n\nOn the other side I notice that I like several tasks that more xNxP types (I guess) hate which is usually repetitive or "tedious" detail work or desk research and so on. If she can find these things in her company she might be able to get more comfortable tasks for herself while being the favorite colleague for taking over these things.\n\nSome optimism goes a long way. She should try to notice and believe in praise she gets and acknowledge her own achievements. It's easy to brush this off as a one-off or luck or whatever. It is deserved! And if it repeats it will build the experience and predictability that we ISFJs love. You might be able to help her with that. Ask how her day was and "celebrate" the good things. Focus on that.\n\nI also tend to be quiet and not chat with everybody every chance I get. I like to do lunches alone to recharge and nobody was questioning that. However, I also try to integrate and be nice. I often join for a beer after work even if I am not the most fun person in the room. My colleagues appreciate it, I get to know what they do and over time casual communication gets a lot easier.\n\nThat all being said. I also have my doubts that I am in the right space and often crave for a job that I can cultivate mastery in. Then I would feel prepared for most challenges that come my way. I actually was thinking about making a thread about how other ISFJs deal with it. So this is interesting.
2	ISFJ memory	
3	I am an ISFJ and I'm pretty bad with remembering people's faces and names. But my memory is extremely good when people tell me stories and little details about themselves. \nSometimes when I meet someone for the first time, I won't really remember their face but I will remember the clothes they were wearing, my first impression of them, etc. \nSo I guess I have a really good memory but it can also depend on what aspect it would be.
1	I have really good short term memory and memorization. I can also remember small details about people very well.

9	Male ISFJs: Do you ever wish you were a Ti Dom?	I think males in our society our taught more to repress their emotions and be more logical thinkers.  As a result, I think ISFJ girls tend to have a much easier time developing Fe. I know as a male ISFJ I don’t get to exercise and use my auxiliary Fe as much as I want too. While I still use Fe to be polite and compassionate when possible, I know it’s been hard in my life to relate to other guys on an deeper level that I think we ISFJs need to feel like we have a connection with that person. I feel like I have to tailor my Fe strong emotions down when I hangout with thinkers so they don’t judge me as overly emotional or illogical. I know a lot of them consider me to be their friend because I listen to them and validate their opinion (even if I don’t agree with it). It’s always great having male friends that are feelers that I can be more of myself around feeling judged. Now that I’m developing Ti, I do sometimes wish I was a Ti Dom so I can be more detached and think logically without being conflicted with Fe. As an ISFJ, I think Fe just gets in the way of Ti natural nature of independence and impersonal logic. It’d be hella nice to be a Ti Dom. What do you male ISFJs think?
5	(Even though I'm not a male nor an ISFJ)\n\nAfter studying MBTI daily for the past few months, I think that some negative characteristics that are supposedly "linked" to a type can be changed, instead of giving yourself an excuse not to, which in your case means being overly sensitive and emotional just because you're an ISFJ. Not everything is linked to MBTI and being overly sensitive is a trait that any type can have. For example, I'm probably an ISTP and I get emotional at times. MBTI is just a system to see your thought processes, and extraverted feeling is actually unrelated to how sensitive a person is (According to Google, it helps us to understand and empathize with the moods and emotions of others) \n\nSimilarly, Ti doms have their own kind of trouble, and in our case it's most probably being insensitive and socially inept. But of course it is not for every one of us since MBTI is just a general system, after all ;)\n
2	Yes. Ti is really fun.
2	I would be going around hugging everyone I know if I could but, like you mentioned, I feel like I have to have some kind of strong connection with them not to come out as weird. Feeling so empathetic but being unable to show it and being supportive really eats me inside everytime.
2	Inferior Fe can be pretty ugly. It doesn’t mean you’re not emotional or don’t want connection. Those are very real things that feel overwhelming and energy sucking and so you resent it and block it out. \nI understand how socially that’s more acceptable for men to ignore though... but some of that means ignoring social expectations that directly connect to being liked and respected which is stuff most humans need on some level. \n\nBut personal experience shows me that INTP men are still largely regarded as odd (in the bad way) whereas ISFJ men are seen as rather normal. Perhaps it’s because the INTPs aren’t playing the social game, but again, that has its own drawbacks. 
2	There’s no point wishing to be someone else. It’s irrelevant. \n\nTake your personality as ISFJ and take advantage of your Si and Fe (your important cognitive functions).\n\nThis comes from a Ti dom INTP, who should stop being depressed and not be a hypocrite and take advantage of my Ti/Ne.
1	As a Ti dom, I think it’s really important to make sure your ideas make sense and aren’t influenced by emotions. However, being emotional is not a bad thing. Desiring to connect with others is a great thing to want, and it’s wonderful to be sensitive to others needs. 
12	Are you attracted to “dangerous”, “adventurous” personalities?	I got this idea from watching Sherlock when John Watson (classic ISFJ) was lamenting how unbelievable it was that he fell for Mary, who turned out to be not what he thought she was. And then Sherlock told John how he is actually attracted to danger: “You’re abnormally attracted to dangerous situations and people, so is it truly such a surprise that the woman you’ve fallen in love with conforms to that pattern?”\n\nNow of course IRL it’s not as extreme as that but I personally found my self attracted to guys who are not exactly textbook “good guys”. They’re just not as straitlaced as I consider myself to be and I found that pattern can be associated to many things but I just wanna know how other ISFJs are.
14	Definitely! I’ve never been attracted to “safe” people. It’s always been people who are cool and intimidating, or could emotionally damage me in some way. 
7	I do like it when people can bring me out of my comfort zone but not to the point of doing dangerous things. 
5	Not “dangerous,” really, but I definitely seem to gravitate towards people who are very active, adventurous, and/or outgoing. Less straight-laced than me, I guess, but usually more just because of a difference in willingness to try new things than any moral differences; I don’t have a problem with any of the things my friends or SO do, I’m just not comfortable doing them myself. That kind of thing. I don’t like or hang out with anyone I would consider dangerous or a bad person. 
6	To my own downfall, yes. 
4	it depends, since my dad is an infj, I have come to find people that seems to be somewhat similiar to him attractive. but I'm young, I don't know what love is(like..for real, I'm  turning 15 this December) \nSometimes I find myself attracted to outgoing.. or adventurous people too. \n\nIt's kind of a blend.. idk
4	Yes, definitely the less straight laced more open type of personality or else I feel like they are too boring. But I don't like "dangerous" people. 
3	For relationships no im not. Im way to careful for my own good who I choose to be a partner. I dont have a particular type that im looking for but I would like someone similar or close to me as we would have similar values and look at the world in a similar fashion. \n\nFor friends, I like hanging around extroverts since they take most of the social interaction and are often fun to be around. If I didnt I would probably be a hermit at home not talking to anybody. 
3	If you count depressive and emotionally unstable as dangerous and adventurous, lol, then I’ve attracted an ISFJ to these traits. 
2	nah never
14	dealing with slow response or no reply texts	I've got a pretty close group of friends and recently it's been bothering me that some of my texts get no response whatsoever. I don't see them as often anymore since we used to work together so I try to arrange things.\n\nI get that sometimes a quick conversation just abruptly ends, but if I ask a question to arrange something that we talked about and you don't respond to that, what am I suppose to do? I might reach out again a couple days later to ask again as a reminder, but it gets frustrating. \n\nSometimes I'll ignore that happened and text again a few days or a week later and they'll answer the new question and pretend nothing happened before that.\n\nI'm going to chalk it up to me being more sensitive lately, but how do you guys deal with it, especially with your SO or close friends?\n\n\n 
13	TOTALLY, totally relate. I, and I think most ISFJs, am so responsible and on top of things. Especially when it comes to personal matters. When someone sends me a message, I know they want a response—so i respond. I don’t stare at the message, wait hours on end, see it again, ignore it, and then forget. But tbh, many people do. This is something I’ve had a hard time coming to terms with as well. And not taking it personally when I don’t get a response. But it’s really hard for sure.\n\nI actually recently had this guy I was really interested in call me too type A and said I should “slow down” with my quickness in responding. Like sorry dude I’m just responsible and respond promptly when having a conversation.  I didn’t realize my promptness can be a “turn off” to other people. \n\nI also get super frustrated, especially if I’ve asked a direct question or am waiting for a respond regarding impending plans. Even though I hate it, I find myself perseverating over my phone and waiting for a response. By the time they do respond I’m mad. Ugh it’s something I need to work on too! \n\nJust try and keep your expectations low. As much as it sucks. We can’t change other people and you will always encounter those who aren’t great at responding. It just sucks bc we take it personally as sensitive introverts, as opposed to pushing through to get the answers we want. \n
8	[deleted]
6	I relate to you SO much and there is hope!! I’ve gotten a lot better, though I have my weak times too often still lol\n\nI think there’s some people who don’t respond but absolutely can - I wouldn’t waste my time with people like that. They don’t deserve it. \n\nI think there’s people who just don’t care to look at their phone that often, get busy and forget, etc. I personally thought I was way too attached to checking my phone for responses and such. So I keep my phone on silent, sometimes even do not disturb, flip it face down and I turned off all social media and texting pop ups / notifications (I had to keep work notifications off so I just turned my “problem” apps off). After a couple of weeks I only check my texts and such when it crosses my mind, and it’s WAY less now. It drove me crazy for a couple of weeks but now I’m honestly loving it. I think it’s helping me take a step back from it all. Idk if it’ll work for everyone, idk if it’ll keep working for me, but so far it is so it might be worth a try!
5	It has been a frustrating experience for me too because I hate uncertainty. If you cannot push through with a plan, at least tell me. In some cases, I just downplay it and tell myself they are too preoccupied to deal with it and I kind of detach. In some cases, I confront them in a nice way. “Hey, we’re supposed to meet this weekend and I haven’t heard from you again. Are we on? Just let me know.”
1	Well, it depends. Sometimes I panick.. No, rather, What I have problems with is telling the other part no, because I'm scared they will think I don't want to be with them. Once I started crying because I thought I were being too straightforward when telling her no. I need to work on that. What's kind of weird is that this is only valid regarding my best friend. With others, I don't have any problems with saying no.\n\nThe reason for that might be the past. 
7	How kinky are you?	Perhaps 1-10?\n\nAnd when it comes to introducing new kinks does it more often come from you or your partner?\nAlso please feel free to share sub/dom preferences. I'm a bit of a switch myself.
9	I’d say a 4. I’m pretty vanilla but I get turned on when my partner is dominant. I definitely prefer to be submissive but I’m too shy to introduce anything. So it’s always my partner who does. 
3	IDK.. I am definitely on the lower side of the scale.. I think it depends on my partner for most part as long as it doesn't involve extreme stuff like blood, poop, extreme pain etc.. I'm content and prefer plain vanilla but intense lovemaking.. it's definitely all about expressing/sharing/giving love/pleasure and pure sensuous trance of it all.. the more emotional, the better..  I guess I'm more of a romantic. If my partner expects something I do oblige(within limits), so anything new that is 'kinky' comes from my partner. I'm definitely a sub, somehow even when taking the initiative.. I do have some fantasies but they're nothing what one would call, kinky..
2	[deleted]
2	Probably like.. 5 or 6. I get turned on by choking, dominants, forced stuff. But I'm also pretty vanilla? 
2	I don’t really know how to rate it.... maybe a 6 or a 7? \n\nI have a couple of slightly more exotic kinks like a size kink, medical fetish, a thing for sexual exhaustion/forced orgasm, etc, and I lean towards sadism. I haven’t had much opportunity to explore that aspect of myself, but my partner has mentioned the idea of wax play, and the idea of him in pain definitely turns me on lol. \n\nThat being said, I don’t know that I would ever have an interest in the really extreme stuff or the D/s aspect of BDSM, so I certainly wouldn’t put myself on the “very kinky” end of the spectrum. \n
1	8.5 I’m super kinky and actually love exploring new shit. I just don’t want to be the one introducing it necessarily or the one in charge. I’m a sub :) 
13	Sending my love to all of you	
2	aww thankyouuu:) <3 ..sending love to you toooo
2	=D
2	AWWW I'm glad I saw this. 
2	Aw thank you very much! Very sweet. We love you too.
-3	xSFJ Fe flakiness. I have never been too fond of it.\n\n
17	Do you easily fall in love?	Usually takes time for me to warm up to a dating prospect and give in to the attraction. Takes also a few months at least to even allow myself to love the person. What about you?
19	I'm a super cautious person, and it's very slow for me to build trust with someone, so love doesn't happen very fast for me.\n\nI was still waiting for red flags for the first 4-5 months of my current relationship, and once I realized he was a good guy and I could trust him, the love came a little while after that. 
7	[deleted]
6	I fall in love very easily. But, act slowly on my feelings.
11	yes, I do. But also, It’s hard for me to tell if we’re both compatible for each other because I over-empathize, and to the point where it is hard for me to realize the flaws in our relationship (until it’s too late). My relationships have mostly been bright but haven’t lasted long, because of that.\n\n
5	I'd say so? It doesn't take me long to bond with people platonically and otherwise, and with my boyfriend I realized I loved him pretty early on, but with both friends and my relationship it took a long time to be able to fully connect with them, if that makes sense. I have an ISFJ friend who seems to be the same way, but she's a bit more open than I am.
4	Basically someone just has to blink their eyes at me and I’m falling. 
3	no because it can be tricky . I mean you have to get to know that person really well in terms of personality and compatibility if you want an long lasting and successful relationship. I really really despise short term relationships
2	I have never really been in love, (for real) I have found several people attractive and such, but never fallen in love. Take notice that I am only 14(15 in December..). I am not stressing the whole love thing. It will come some day, and that's enough for me.
56	ISFJ appreciation post from an INTJ	Whenever I'm on the INTJ subreddit, I'm always stunned by how many people on there profess a great dislike for ISFJs and Guardian types in general. Usually it seems to come from immature guys who have an ISFJ mom or something and are bitching about how she's "so limiting" or "too emotional" or "not on my level intellectually." As for me, my parents are the "intuitive dream couple" (INTJ-ENFP) and while they're awesome people, they can be a bit...intense and overbearing at times. I really recognize what sensors do for the world--honestly, without them, nothing would function...Anyway, I meandered a bit, but basically what I want to say is that ISFJs are AWESOME.  \n\n\nA few reasons why:\n\n\-You have unbelievable emotional intelligence. As an INTJ, I have pretty much none. I'm barely in touch with my own feelings, let alone other people's.  \n\-You're practical and know what needs to be done in a given situation (I'm always living in my head and missing details).   \n\-You're consistent. As someone who values this greatly, but sometimes has trouble maintaining consistency himself, I really appreciate that.  \n\-You're selfless. Objectively a great trait and one which I very much lack.  \n\-You're really nice. Criticisms of ISFJ characters in books and movies usually revolve around something like "She/he is too nice." Well WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH BEING NICE?! Certainly nothing last time I checked. On the topic of books, two of my favorite literary heroines are ISFJs (Lucie from A Tale of Two Cities--who sometimes gets hate but I don't understand it--and Sonya from Crime and Punishment). Incidentally, they both try to help massively screwed up INTJ guys.  \n\n\nHonestly, most of the time I hate people and I can be a cold bastard , but you all make me want to get in touch with my Fi and be a nicer person more than anybody else.  \n\n\n\-an appreciative INTJ
19	this makes me feel warm In  my heart, 
10	funnily enough a handful of my online friends are NT types (INTP, ENTJ, and INTJ) and I think I'm closer to them than a lot other feeling types \n\nAnd they've expressed to me openly how much they enjoy hanging out with me in particular because I stick out in terms of ISFJness (they dont know MBTI well but they basically say similar things to what you did)\n\nAnd it does feel nice to hear because well compliments are nice \n\nAnd yeah when I meet actual mature / non-edgelord/elitist xNTJs, I actually like how honest and smart they are without necessarily gloating while still being fun to hang out with. Sometimes with other feeler friends (of any type) I do feel like I have to walk on egg shells due to having to take into account how sensitive some can be but I can bring out my more honest side around xNTJs\n\nBut anyway thanks!
8	Thanks for the kind words. I have heard that INTJs and ISFJs pretty much are enemies in the MBTI world. I really apperciate you taking time out of your day to write such a nice post. 
3	Thankyou for the appreciation, INTJ! I love INTJs too!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd, never knew Sonya is an ISFJ, she's one of my favorite characters as well.  :)
1	Hey this is pretty nice of you. While I don't always get along with INTJ types, I've met some really decent folks who claimed to be.\n\nHowever, I am quite curious about this word choice. It could be me being nitpicky, but...\n>Honestly, most of the time I hate people \n\nHate is quite strong, no? I've always thought thinker types were indifferent to people, since you say you are cold and out of touch with your feeling side. I mean, you guys are so focused on your... thinking/non-people oriented goals. I can directly explain why I, a person who uses Fe, actively dislike people at times. Hate, to me, indicates that people actually have some sort of impact on you emotionally.
1	As someone who has been dating an INTJ for five years, it makes me so happy to know that we are not doomed like everything in the MBTI subreddits seems to believe. 
1	Enfp with an ISFJ and I love him 🤗 great post!
1	awww\n\n\nwell as an isfj , i can be very limiting to the point of being a boring person and it's true anyways. Emotional? well not so much but it depends on the situation. Oh what about being nice? Yep  Im nice in a polite way because we isfjs choose our battle CAREFULLY . Thus we hate conflict. \n\nI dont know about you nt types but as for intuitive types, they are generally insightful and intelligent but at the same time ( no offense) , they can be a bit overbearing and somewhat not grounded on reality ( based on experience from my enfj bff and intp friend). Other than that, they have managed to get me out of my shell through philosophies and conspiracy theories which i really like. My intp friend can be accomodating and supportive of me but at the same time, can offer cold logic about some topics especially the ones he doesnt care about. He's cerebral type of person.\n\nI may come off as defensive hahah but regardless, thank you for this 😊😊😊
21	Anyone else struggle with saying no?	I’m the worst at telling people no. I feel so beyond guilty for it, even if I have a good excuse. I stress about it and go over situations and what they could be feeling or thinking if I do say no. \n\nExample: Nov - Jan turns into my fiancé’s family plans almost every weekend. No big deal, it’s the holidays and a lot of birthdays during that time. I just had to cancel on a thing thrown in there (they do some outings for the women so I’m just missing that, not a bday or holiday thing) and I could tell my future mother in law wasn’t happy about it and I feel so beyond guilty, but I’ve just got too much on my plate (we’re also wedding planning). Even though I know it’s okay to cancel and everyone will be fine, I sit here and worry about it non stop. \n\nIs this an ISFJ thing? Anyone have success with getting better about this? Any advice welcome!
7	Oh yes. Last weekend I got invited out to celebrate a birthday. I said yes knowing I would get home from an all-day road trip roughly 30-45 minutes before I would have to leave again to make this. "I won't be that tired it'll be fine" I said to myself\n\nEven after I got home exhausted, and I knew it was very much not in my best interest to go, and I knew everyone would be cool (and they were), I was still so nervous about canceling.\n\nIt seems to be an ISFJ thing, but I don't know how you get over it.
4	Yup! At work is the worst. Can’t say no unless I’m at a pinnacle peak and know that the no does not outweigh the workload currently dealing with.
3	All the time. Help.
3	My fiancé is an isfj. And this is him. It drives me crazy! He will do favors for everyone and then in our date. He’s super moody and then asks why I won’t ask anything of him. Because he’s too busy. 
4	YES. And the problem with over apologizing. I cannot help myself.\n\nI hope you somehow find a way to stop feeling guilty. 
3	I've developed a habit to say "I'll check what I have going on and get back to you". If I'm lucky, I never get asked again, lol.\n\nI have more trouble inviting people to stuff. I don't want them saying "no", and I'll imagine them saying "no".
2	YEP.\n\nI've gotten better at it as I've gotten older, especially when it comes to my coworkers asking for too much from me, but yeah, it's so hard to say no in most situations. Don't really have any advice about improving things though, it just kinda...got a bit better on its own for me.
2	sometimes, it depends on who's asking.\nbut i can say no clearly if there is something I don't like or want to do.
2	I used to have trouble saying no because I felt obligated or responsible to my commitments to people/job.\n\nAfter some time, I'll reach my tipping my point and become resentful.\n\nNow I've learned to not stretch myself thin for the sake of others. No point burning yourself to keep others warm.\n\nFor the few people that matter to me, I have no problems going above and beyond for them, even if I'm exhausted or caught up with work. Some how, some way, I will make time.
2	yep. yesterday i bought $50 worth of lush products because i felt awkward and uncomfortable declining recommendations from the salesman 
5	Blind Te???	How does blind Te manifest among isfjs? 
7	In my experience they make conclusions based on their individual experience in the past or right now. They strongly tend to not be aware to facts & data as – long they are not affected by them personally.\n\nThey consider & hear to what other people value. But if they think it is dumb, they do not rely on it. So they have to go through experiences case by case to be able to see a pattern. So it can happen that ISFJs can make conclusions without reference materials. Not a bad thing.\n\nThough they seem to not be aware to what other people think or that they might be smart too or might already know what they are talking about.
18	Excited to find /r/ISFJ	Hello!\n\nI am a ISFJ, and want to say I love you ISFJ! Browsing through posts and you guys are spot on with descriptions. I didn't choose the ISFJ life, it chose me.\n\nI'd like to get to know you all!

8	isfj and infp	do they mesh well?
6	Very. Longest relationship I've had in my life is with an INFP. They're still my best friend after all these years. 
5	My best friend is an INFP! We get each other and like the same things. I think when I’m with her I’m my best self.\n\nEdit: I love how everyone here mentions their specific experience with an INFP. I think in other subs it would be talking about compatible functions etc.... It’s very Si :) 
5	My husbands an infp. Sometimes it’s a struggle with me looking for empathy from him rather than solutions to issues I know how to fix. But ultimately we work out. I don’t think it could be reduced to personality types tho. 
5	My sister is an INFP. I think I have had a few friendships with INFPs. Overall, I like the dynamic with all of them. They can be relatively reserved. I think with the Introvert and Feeling in common we can both relate to be quiet, but empathetic individuals. I also admire how with their Ne they're able to look at a situation from many different angles which is something I struggle with.  
4	My fiancé is an INFP, so I think we work pretty well together! :) 
3	YES. Very well.
2	I swear I'm both. Not sure how well it's working out so far.
1	I mistyped as an INFP at first, and my most recent ex is an INFP. We still get along super well and we talk all the time.
4	ISFJ Cognitive functions and four sides of the mind EXPLAINED	
5	I don’t watch mbti videos over 10 minutes because they are usually rambling and content light. Like, if the person wrote it down and edited their thoughts, it would only be a page long. But that would be too much effort as opposed to ranting into a camera ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ You also can’t scan a video like you can with text to know if it’s worth reading. \n\n\nHonestly, someone let me know if the video conveys the same amount of information I would get from 18 minutes of reading.
1	What are your thoughts? 
4	auxilliary Ti?	how do you guys use it?
10	I use it for thinking about how things work- quite often when I’m not actively talking to people or remembering a moment. It can catalogue experiences, figure out a new system, analyze people from a step back. \n\nIt’s slower and less natural than what my i*tp friends do, but it works pretty okay. 
3	I find I use it whenever I’m making a decision that affects only myself. I take a while to make these decisions because I want to analyze all the data and determine what makes sense. In addition, it  helps me study in college as I’m able to analyze the facts with Si and Ti. Also, as I get older I find it easier to analyze my experiences and test them against logical scrutiny. Lastly, I play games like Sudoku or poker to exercise my Ti. In a negative way, it can be used when I over analyze or get stuck in the loop that I forget to consider the needs of others. 
2	Good question. My ISFJ wife has this amazing capacity to go through logical patterns like: When this its true then this is true and when this is false then that is false. It is amazing, how she can come to conclusions without using facts and data. Though her thinking process is slower than mine, as I have Te Hero. This creates a different dynamic in coffee talks between her and me as ENTJ.\n\n&#x200B;

60	When I tell people I'm a ISFJ	
16	If this sub had custom tags, mine would be “ISFJ- not your mom”\n\nMore seriously, most people think I’m an INFJ because they’ve never met a real one and I’m not a facile goody-two-shoes. 
10	I don't normally bring up my type, but today my sister told me I should start my own business, and I said "I'm not an entrepreneur, I'm an ISFJ"!
3	haha i love it! 
4	Kind of sounds like..... ESFJ? Hahah
1	HAHA Good one. As an ISFJ I'm nothing like a mom or dad. 
1	More job Stuffs & Opinion	Guise, you can look on my oldddd posts as I continue struggling to figure out a path (along with doting on entps :DD). Got a (what I feel) is a worthless Bachelors, got a "respectable" job right after college. Had anorexia, dropped out of life for a few years and got in majorrrrr debt with medical bills. Decided to get into the fitness industry and was a PT for a bit. Now I'm back in the industry I went to college for and it's eating away at me, being sucked into the 9-5 life. I'm trying to figure out some side paths. Any non 9-5 side paths that have been meaningful to my fellow isfjs? One new hobby I've been doing is actually creating personality shirts (yes this is a bit of shameless promotion, but humor me? may remove if not okay). But yeah, I've specifically been obsessed with mbti, socionics, all things psych and this has been a new fulfilling hobby: [https://teespring.com/stores/personal-apparel](https://teespring.com/stores/personal-apparel) (let me know if you have any requests and I'll see what I can do :D).\n\nI think this really satisfies my inferior Ne, but obviously I can't make a living doing this. I'm also planning to take personal classes on digital marketing so I can find ways to make creative endeavors not only personally fulfilling, but hopefully financially. So I guess, outside of shameless promotion, I'm asking - has any isfj succeeded in a non traditional, totally entrepreneurial venture? Advice (outside of stop promoting on forums :P). \n\nThanks my lovely fellow isfjs!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nT

Piggybacking off of [this recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/9ect4j/what_are_you_like_when_youre_drunk/) about how we act when we're drunk, I am wondering, *how* do you know when you're drunk? Can you steadily feel yourself getting buzzed and then drunk or do you feel sober until you try to go to the bathroom? Is it your vision, your balance, your speech, mannerisms, etc.? \n\n&#x200B;
5	I personally feel like my limbs are very loose and kind of heavy. I like to shake my shoulders to tell if I'm just buzzed or if I'm *drunk*. Also, I usually hear my speech start slurring before I *feel* drunk, and at this point of being buzzed I will be friendly and talkative, so then I'll think, "uh oh, I can hear that I'm drunk!" and usually within a few minutes I start feeling a bit dizzy or lightheaded. Going to the bathroom is where I face *exactly* how drunk I am because it's one of the things you've been doing your entire life and you do it often so it's usually quite easy, but it just feels like a quest or something trying to keep it together while I pull my pants back up without falling over or something, lol! I feel this need to *walk*! Especially if I am drunk at night, I just really want to go outside and go for a nice drunk walk so when I start feeling that pull, I know I'm more than buzzed. \n\nI wanted to ask this question because a friend of mine said his first sign of being drunk was his eyes got kinda fuzzy and then his balance was off, and had no idea what I meant by loose heavy limbs! 
2	Not an ISFJ, but I like the question. ;)   \n\n\nDrunkenness is a continuum, so I suspect it'll be interesting to see where everyone decides the line is.   \n\n\nIn the past, I've been a bit of a tank--to the point where most people can't tell that I'm feeling anything, even if my subjective experience is screaming to the contrary. It can be hard for me to will myself to engage with other people, and I count myself as "officially drunk" at that point where my face feels like a swarm of bees and it takes herculean effort to remain present for a conversation. This is when I retreat to my cave. Lol.  
2	When I'm drunk, I start to feel very lightheaded. My arms and hand numb, and as I drink more, my face goes numb. I can't speak for everyone, but for me, I start to talk much louder than I think, and I start to say weird or random things without thinking about it.
2	I get this (( l i g h t )) sensation in my head, then my limbs.. it's like.. an internal floating yet some sort of heavy sensation :D ..I can't explain it.. and I feel what I call 'high', wherein I'm just :) :) :) and soooo relaxed.. in my speech, actions, calmness.. I feel as if the time slows down, and I am more aware.. like, a stillness mentally, despite physical 'floating' or dizzyness all over the body.. I love listening to music, because it feels more beautiful to listen to music in this state, sometimes, I feel more high because of intoxication I get from music that only heightens my drunken experience :D While walking, I feel I may fall down if I am not careful, has never happened.. but I love that feeling, it makes me laugh to *try* to walk without falling down :D I also blush easily during this state.. \n\nOn the outside, I look :) :) :).. almost the same as my sober self lol
2	Clear pronunciation is much more difficult, even when I try. Also trying to walk normally back to take a piss feels a bit like a balancing act. 
2	Proper drunk? The thought "Oh god I can't feel my teeth" normally pops into my head.\n\nMost people can't tell when I have a good buzz going until it's approaching drunk. Probably because  the entire time I actually act like a normal human being that can interact and chat with others haha.
1	Just start to feel more of the sensations. I notice I become a bit more in tuned with the moment and i feel energized and excited!!
22	Too Much Judgement	I personally dislike when people constantly get mad at other people for trivial things such as their physical appearance or some other small but personal thing they choose to do in their life. Do other ISFJs also feel strongly against harsh judgment on individuals? 
13	Yes. Annoys me very much.
8	Yeah I just feel like everyone has their quirks and if they're not harming anyone, and it doesn't affect you then why worry.
4	My boyfriends entire family is like this it drives me crazy 
2	Can you explain please?\n\n&#x200B;
1	Yup
1	Yep definitely. 
1	YES YES. \n\nVery much. 
1	Good question Sharpes\_Sword!  \n\n\nMy ISFJ Wife never backbite and is very mercyful with people even if they are bad.  \nIn my point of view its wasted time to backbite about people. Usually I neither do it or feel offended when others do.  \n\n\nWhen I am very angry, the worst thing is a little rant about somebody, but after some minutes its normal again.
1	TOTALLY.

31	Top 10 things I LOVE about ISFJ's as an ENTP (part 2)	I am so attracted to you and have the deepest of love and appreciation for you.  I have only dated INFJ's and ISFJ's (not by choice, it just works out that way...before I even knew what MBTI was).  I feel like in many ways the INFJ is more of a natural fit, but the ISFJ completes me more in a developmental way.  So here's a list of:\n\nTop 10 things I love about the ISFJ.\n\n1. **The ISFJ is SO "cute"!!!** \- I feel like the ISFJ are the "cutest" type.  Where as I find the INFJ more hardcore and "hot" in their depth and complexity but, I've always been attracted to cuteness, lightness, innocence, positivity, and responsibility.  I've always thought Marge Simpson was an ideal partner (ISFJ).  You guys are societies' Disney Characters and I LOVE IT SO MUCH.\n2. **The ISFJ/ENTP combo makes the best fictional relationships** \- Jim Halpert (ENTP) and Pam Beesley (ISFJ), Back to the Future's Dr. Emmett Brown (ENTP) and Clara (ISFJ), Saul Goodman or Jimmy McGill (ENTP) and Kim Wexler (ISFJ) from Better Call Saul, Sebastian (ENTP) and Mia (ISFJ) from La La Land....I could go on...basically all of the enviable and great relationships in fiction are ENTP/ISFJ :D\n3. **The ISFJ "Includer"** \- As someone who feels lonely and a chronic misfit most of his life, I cherish those who are sensitive to including me and making sure I feel okay.  My ISFJ wife is so thoughtful and concerned about people being left out, feeling unwelcome, or being lonely.  ISFJ's are the champions of inclusion.  Thank you.\n4. **The ISFJ and fairness** \- As someone who is committed to justice and equality, the ISFJ develops "fairness" within my soul. This can be annoying at times, as what is fair is not always delivered on the same terms as justice and equality.  \n5. **Responsibility and Dutiful** \- These are the two things I do not naturally possess for things related to the "day to day" and the short term duties such as paying bills, keeping commitments, following through.  The ISFJ helps me in this.  And in return, when it comes to core values, long term vision, and things that have lasting impact, I help the ISFJ first be able to see the big picture and remind them why it's important to stay true to your values (or develop them for yourself in the first place).  When it comes to long term commitment, I have no issues.\n6. **The ISFJ is "Good"** \- I love how you are so "light", I can see it in your eyes.  You are such an example of random acts of kindness and charity.  Again, thank you for this example.  I can be inclined to fudge things, bend rules, even tell white lies when I feel it serves a bigger purpose, and the ISFJ is there to remind me to be totally honest.\n7. **ISFJ's are surprisingly deep** \- I know they can seem superficial, but that's only when they are limited in their exposure to others who are deep.  The ISFJ has the ability to "know" things about people, they are surprisingly good readers of character when emotions aren't being manipulated.  When there is a manipulator out there who could use the ISFJ's emotional susceptibility, the ENTP has your back.\n8. **The ISFJ saves souls** \- I feel like the ISFJ's in my life have rescued me from some really dark places and really have a deep love of God or whatever you wanna call it and feels love very deeply in a divine kind of way.  The ISFJ's do this.\n9. **My kind of sexy** \- Like I said, I always thought Marge Simpson was sexy.  Why?  Because of that goodness factor, that sweetness...and then out of the blue they blow you away with their surprisingly intense sexual passion.  I've always been attracted to modesty - the clean and self-respecting girl - I've never kissed a woman I didn't love, and held off on sex until marriage.  It was worth it.\n10. **A good balance of being grounded and tolerant** \- You let me explore.  I need that.  And then, you bring me back down to earth.  I need that too.\n\n&#x200B;
18	Tbh this list kind of freaks me out. A kind of conditional pedestal to put that specific isfj you’re talking about on. 
11	As a researcher, I've gotta ask what your sample size is here. This is a nice post but it does feel conditional as a previous commenter pointed out, and many of your points are viewed exclusively through the lens of your romantic relationships.  Many of the things you say are quite nice, and definitely hold good nuggets of truth (like the includer bullet point!) but when people disagree with you in the comments about how they identify themselves, you're pushing back and telling them to deal with it, instead of trying to listen to their perspective. I'd encourage you to try to apply the points on this list to ISFJ friends or colleagues and modify it to be more reflective of actions or behaviors rather than subjective opinion, because as you know, our romantic selves are only one facet of our personality. There are lots of experts here who could help you fine tune your list!
7	Mfw these are all female\n\nMfw I'm a male ISFJ\n\nMfw all ISFJ praise are always directed at females\n\nMfw mfw mfw
6	Actually, this very nice from you. Thank you for your kind words-they made me feel proud of my type. :) 
3	Was it hard to produce such an organized final peice? 😜Just giving ya crap. D’awhhh. If you feel so inclined, you can find many a posts of me gushing about my entp and what I love about you spazzy beautifuls as well! :D 
4	`The ISFJ is SO "cute"!!!`\n\nNo I'm not.\n\n`The ISFJ/ENTP combo makes the best fictional relationships`\n\nI am with INTP. Can somewhat confirm.\n\n`The ISFJ "Includer"`\n\nYes. I do that often.\n\n`The ISFJ and fairness`\n\nNot anymore. Life isn't fair and you have to be unfair to climb.\n\n---\n\nEverything else is subjectively lovey-dovey.\n\n\n\n
2	aww damn.. show this to your wife! :) 
1	So... some thoughts since I have some time.\n\nI don't feel like you can believe in personality typing but not in being specifically attracted to those types for specific reasons. It's kind of the same as believing in astrology and thinking you're attracted to say, Capricorns, because they are studious, "good", responsible, grounded, and fair. I didn't see most of the list as conditional, I saw it as a list of the things you like and notice about us when we're at our best or when they come out. I'm sure you have a list of 10 things you HATE about ISFJ, but it's not like they would apply 100% of the time I assume. I doubt you expect us to all be tolerant to everyone and everything and never lose our temper or decide enough is enough, or to be so responsible as to never ever forget a deadline or something. \n\nNumber 8 and 9 though, honestly, have nothing to do with being an ISFJ. Tons of us have no waited for sex until marriage but are still modest, and self-respecting. Many of us do not even believe in a God or in anything divine let alone have a "deep love of God." You're probably looking for a churchgoing woman, not an ISFJ, if you want a religious virgin who does random acts of good and works with charity, because those are not personality traits and they are not universal. I do see that you say it's been the ISFJs in your life specifically that have this love of god, but it might just be where you're meeting the people who are coincidentally ISFJs.\n\nHowever, while I'm sure this list was inspired by your partner and you were being playful in your responses, some people don't see playful tones all the time online. So, trying to say ,"soooo DEAL with it! :P :P :P :P" becomes "uh, just deal with it." \n\n**It is your use of the word CLEAN in point #9 that is actually a problem in my opinion. And things like 'clean' or 'unclean' are certainly not personality traits that you can apply to an entire group of people like that.** You honestly could rephrase that entire point to be a lot less disrespectful. 
1	numbers 3 5 7 and 10 are spot on
1	I saw your other posts and I think you are kind of right in both the worst and best aspects of an ISFJ. I hope you and your marriage recover from her actions, really... I'm in a relationship with an ENTP and we have been through rough times, I can understand the frustration you express in your rant post bc well..I saw my SO through that too. I also had the impulse to "run away" from our relationship and pursue a simpler man.. I never did anything totally disloyal like kissing or anything, but maybe it would have been considered as emotional cheating... I guess with all the stresses and differences exposed, she feels like you two maybe can't work together. That may not be necessary true, but it can be difficult and long process, bc ISFJ are very reluctant to change and outside pressure for changing can shut us down. I'm glad you are going to marriage counseling. Wish you the best. \n\nEdit: I'm glad I didn't went with the "simpler" guy and stayed loyal to my partner, we complement perfectly and I love his humor and the conversations we have. 
9	Dear ISFJ's....I AM SO SORRY...Opening my soul to you today (PART 1)	My beloved ISFJ's, I'm going to open up here, be brutally honest with myself and you - I woke up this morning feeling bad about something...like from the second I opened my eyes and oriented myself, but I couldn't figure out what it was.  Then I remembered.  My post.\n\nGuys...I am so sorry.  I was going through something yesterday and I had no outlet during a very dark time.  As I said before, my wife has struggled with my new direction, and it's completely understandable, as leaving security and predictability for the unknown is not the ISFJ's preference.  \n\nTo give context for yesterday, I was in a state of loneliness and heartbreak as my wife was out on a country dancing date with a guy she met earlier this year and has had some intimate contact with (not sex, but kissing and that kind of stuff).  She met him while I was traveling for extended periods of time working on my book and academic research.  She has been suffering from male issues since her dad left when she was 9, was sexually abused at 11, and raised in poverty as both of her parents are deaf.  That said, I have a lot of compassion and understanding and my personality is suited perfectly to allow her the flexibility and space she needs to figure things out.  She met this guy who recently divorced his wife because she had anxiety and depression issues (so does my wife...just let that process for a minute).  But he's a blue-collar worker, simple, easy going, and he appeals to her feelings and gives her something that she feels is very good for her soul and I absolutely hate it, but I can tolerate it.  It's just a very hard thing for me.  She has always been vocal about how she wished I was more of a simple man, predictable, reliable, easy going, laid back...but then goes through periods where she's in love with my intensity and idealism.  The thing is...I WISH I was more of a simple man many days.  I loathe the fact that I was born this way, so overactive in my nervous system and brain, such a misfit, so lonely.  So the fact that she has sought out another man who is a simple man, makes me feel very sad.  The fact that he left his wife, that he has no problems pursuing a married woman...these are things that go against my deepest values and I do not respect as I am very loyal and long-suffering with my commitments.  I communicated to her that I was not comfortable with her going down to see him, that I'm not comfortable having an "open marriage" and the more I expressed it, things got ugly.\n\nI think the thing that really has bothered me is how justified she's been by society to potentially jeopardize our marriage and little family (we have 2 little boys).  When I went from being clean shaven, neatly dressed, corporate and all that to having a beard, long hair, academic...it seems like she's been encouraged and justified to pursue this guy because I have betrayed our family by what is perceived to be irresponsibility.  \n\nSo here I am.  She finally came home after being out all night, and seems really happy.  We are going to marriage counseling (and have been for a while now).  I don't understand the ISFJ and how unselfish they can be in the short term but how fickle they can be in the long term.  It's like....we are exact opposites or something :D lol\n\nIf someone could speak to me and help me understand why a woman would ever want a simple man as a long term solution over a passionate loyal and faithful man who is a good father.  I feel like she's taking advantage of my openness and flexibility and that a lot of xSFJ's do too.  \n\nAgain, I'm sorry, and I thank you for letting me open up.  Now on to part two.
11	As an ISFJ female i find this post disturbing, i really can not relate to your wife and her disloyalty! When i have been in relationships i go all in for better or worse! I truly think that in this case its not you that is the problem, or her wanting a simpler man! She is "seeing" this guy because she has the "grass is always greener" mindset. She thinks that giving up on her faithfulness to you and starting something new with another random guy is gonna fix her personal issues.  She is running away from herself and her own demons, in the meantime she is ruining the love and bond you guys have built up over time. I'm very sad that you are in this situation! You should not put up with this, we (isfj's) respond well to firm and assertive words and beliefs from our loved ones and she should not feel for one second that her seeing another man when she already has a husband and a family, is in ANY WAY ok. Not for you or your kids. \nI'm sorry if I've overstepped, I usually never comment but i felt compelled! 
8	Very sorry for what you are going through.. IDK what to say. Really wishing things will work out through counseling and with time everything falls into place.. How did she respond when you said that you weren't okay with an open marriage??\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't apologize here to us strangers, you don't owe any apology to any of us here :) \n\n&#x200B;
2	To answer your bottom question...\n\nWe just want to be loved. We don’t want fancy, complicated things, we want simplicity and....\n\nSomeone we can fix. You’re not fixable (read: you have nothing that seems to need fixing) and you seem to have a bit of a temper. This man appeals to her through similarity and she feels as if she can help him go through it. 
2	my isfj husband stepped out on me while I was very ill, so yes even isfj can be disloyal especially when stressed. You need to stop being flexible, open-minded & 'nice' when it comes to potential infidelity - it can destroy your family! You should firmly point out that you have been loyal while that other guy dropped his wife as soon as the going got rough. I hope you are earning enough money as a academic & are responsible with the bills because that is important to isfj's imo.... 
2	I know when isfjs had already enough BUT NOT THIS WAY.\n\nShe gives a bad name to all isfjs and I hope shes been mistyped because if she isnt then I dont know what to do.\n\nIf she really loves you then she should just stay with one man and mingle with another man. She's not a loyal wife! \n\nIf she continues this then i suggest you file a divorce 
1	I feel like she might be an ISFJ in the grip if Ne? Regardless, personality aside, that's so not okay of your wife. \n\nSet some boundaries, this isn't okay.\n\nSorry you're going through this.
0	I hope shes mistyped
5	Another cute video we made shortly after we were married. <3. ISFJ's = CUTEST.	
3	cute:)
3	Omg this is so me (isfj) and my entp. Such a wonderful pairing. 😃
2	lol!
12	Do any of you guy's have a no bullshit attitude?	I'm a pretty nice guy.  I get along with pretty much anyone.  However,  when people start pushing my buttons,  I tend to check that person.  How many of you guy's are the same way. 
17	it takes a lot to get on my nerves, but if some thing especially stupid happens i can get really angry on that person.
11	If you make me angry you're gonna get my wrath but I'm usually super reserved and will ignore you or will be nice if I acknowledge you. I'm kind of like an emotional mirror when they're heightened, though. Be nice to me, you'll usually get more niceness back but I can be the world's biggest jerk if you're mean to me.
9	I'm the same, it takes a lot to actually make me mad but if it happens it ain't pretty.
4	If im not vibing with someone anymore they’re out simple as that 
3	I have a bad temper when I lose it but that hardly ever ever happens. I tend to just go cold and freeze people when they grate on me, if they're looking for a reaction/validation it totally annoys them.
3	I had a friend, I guess he was parasitic time to time. It took me 7 years to explode on him, and when I did, i grinded his bones so bad he started crying a lot. After that I stopped any contact with him. And the thing is that I didn't feel bad about the whole thing even slightly. (I still don't know how to feel about that reaction of mine)\n\nI guess I have a whole lot of patience, but if somebody manages to get to me, I will break people. \n\nAnd yes, interesting observation: a lot of people tend to forget bad (or at least not nice) stuff that people do to them, but I personally feel that I have an "asshole meter" for each person that can never be reset. \n\n
3	Yes totally. It’s funny bc when I like someone...I’ll cut them a lot of slack, be super nice/friendly/talkative. But if someone just bothers me straight off the bat, I literally don’t give a f*** about them and will ignore them
2	Oh yes, if someone crosses the line and really pisses me off. Have you heard of the INFJ doorslam? I can doorslam them like INFJ and it will be very hard for me to forgive them. 
2	Yeah, sometimes I get like this. Usually I have a high threshold but when I feel somebody is going out of their way to bother me I give them 0 leeway.
3	Video: What it’s like to be an ISFJ WIFE (spouse) of an ENTP. My wife made this last week :)	
2	Awh this is great! I generally don’t enjoy being an isfj, but your wife makes me appreciate the reasons I do. Also, with an entp bf too, I can relate. Love entps SO big! 
1	Do you see that trademark ISFJ "Light" in her eyes?  SHe's such a little Disney duck.  <3
1	Not loading. 
1	[deleted]
3	How do you guy's feel about being parents? Including being in romantic relationships?	One of my biggest fear in life is having a child.  Everytime I think about it,  it makes me scared and depress.  I can't see myself having a child. And when it comes to romantic relationships,  I have a very hard time trusting people.  It's hard for me to open up to people and while not worrying about them using information against me. Do any of you guys feel this way? Sorry for the grammar mistakes. 
6	I want to have a child or be a parent so badly, it scares me :(\n\nSame with romantic relationship, want to be madly in love, and be with a person who loves me.. I have some romantic views on this, but I desire romantic relationship that lasts my lifetime.. it is a deep wish from within, that sometimes - to wish for it often or to even express it like I'm doing here feels scary.\n\nAlthough I love such close relationships, romantic or parental, I always have a fear deep inside, fear of unknown, fear of losing them.. the more deeply I love , the bigger the fear - I already experience it with my parents. When I realize how much I love them, on one hand it is so beautiful and feel blessed but somewhere deep within, the fear also emerges.. I can't explain that feeling.. .. 
5	I never ever want kids in my life!\nAlso in relationships I tend to expect too much from my partner while feeling like I give/invest way more in the relationship than the other person.\n\nWhen it comes to kids I have to turn the dude down right there if he wants kids, its a dealbreaker for me. I don't want him to start trying to change my mind. 
2	Don't want kids. I'm a recluse and I don't really want a rls either. Tried it once but she was very clingy. I need a LOT of space.
1	my isfj hubby was scared to have children too, but he was so happy when we had our first child
3	What is your astrology sign? Just curious if there’s some type of correlation :-)	I am a scorpio!
7	Virgo here!
3	strangely, scorpio too. But I don’t relate to the vengeance part of my sign at all, which is weird cause it’s supposed to be the most prominent trait. 
3	Cancer 
4	Cancer. It sounds like there are a lot of water signs here! 
4	Pisces here
4	Gemini
3	Cancer!
3	Cancer
2	I’m also Scorpio lmao 
2	Scorpio here\n
2	Scorpio here as well. Haha
2	Sagittarius! 
2	Wow aI lot of Scorpios. I guess I would be the first Leo 
2	Leo.
2	Sagittarius (for what it's worth I am right on the cusp of Capricorn and I was an INFJ growing up - it really changed LOL) 
2	I'm also a scorpio!!
2	Scorpio!
1	Aquarius!
1	my bf is an isfj aries! (with a taurus moon/gemini rising for those who know what I am talking bout).\n\nI actually now a few ISFJ aries, seems rare
1	Aries !
1	Taurus 
1	Capricorn :)
1	Aries
1	Leo Sun, Virgo Moon, Leo Rising
1	Sagittarius 
1	Virgo. There shouldn’t be
8	What are you like when you're drunk?	
27	Happy, chatty and carefree. Drunk me always gets good feedback.
12	Calm, carefree, and alot more loose and chatty.
10	I become very calm - inside-out, still, smiley.. I like to sit close to or lay down with my loved ones, hug them, kiss them. But, what is most important to me when I'm drunk is MUSIC. Music must playyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.. I love laying on my bed and listening to music when I'm drunk.. 
10	Friendlier and more talkative. More loose and just kind of care free\n
8	I’m very friendly, touchy feely, usually trying to make out with everyone. I also am much more open and share stories, don’t mind having attention on me. I alternate between taking shots and checking on the person puking in the bathroom and making sure they get to bed okay with a glass of water. 
6	Chatty, no filter, also sad!!!
4	Really goofy and carefree, then sad later on
3	Mellow.  But I'm usually mellow when I'm sober. 
3	I become a tad bit more confident and definutely more affectionate wit my words 
3	Very talkative, and tending to think I'm hilarious.
3	Happy, I can alternate between being calm and hyper depending on what I drank. More inviting towards people and a lot more outgoing sometimes. I basically become an ESFJ lol.
3	Depends. If I'm with someone - specifically someone I'm attracted to - I make my attraction very well known (not inappropriately mind you, and I still respect boundaries). Easier for me to put my emotions into words, go for a kiss, hold hands, whatever. Much less self-conscious.\n\nWith social groups, just overall more chatty and involved. Not internally going "Oh god I need my hiding place." Other times I get "locked in" where I'm sitting on the edge of the group, observing the chaos and taking the energy in without being involved.
2	A lot more relaxed and chatty, no filter like the others said. Generally a happy carefree drunk, especially when I’m with others.
2	Lots of laughter, to the point of tears at times. But very mellow, not a squeaky/giggly drunk.
1	Need to vent....ENTP married to an ISFJ wife...oh the differences	Why do ISFJ's feel so justified in holding such contradictory views such as being compassionate, loving, and understanding AS LONG AS those receiving the benefits of your personality are "deserving" of it?\n\nDo you not see the ways you are manipulative?  Masquerading compassion and understanding so that you can ultimately get something in return (usually relating to feeling needed, receiving validation, praise, attraction, etc)?\n\nWhy do ISFJ's allow themselves to be taken advantage of and then cry "victim" so easily?\n\nWhy do ISFJ's adopt delusional narratives about others and themselves so long as they get the approval, attention, and validation they desperately need but typically on a superficial level?\n\nWhy are you even attracted to ENTP's?  You like the misunderstood one, the quirky one, the one who needs to be included in the short term but in the long term the ISFJ can be surprisingly shallow.\n\nWhy are you so shallow, yet, so capable of depth?  How can you live with yourself?\n\nWhy do you take advantage of our openness and flexibility but then decry those traits to "them" when engaged in gossip?\n\nDo you not see the value in how the ENTP's capacity to predict and anticipate events before they happen and how the ENTP in a big picture way kind of has the potential to save you from yourselves, save you from a shallow, robotic, meaningless life?\n\nDo you not value the countless hours we sit by and listen to you tell us about all the little events of your day, the trivial conflicts you were presented with, and then have very little patience when we want to share with you something relating to a theory or a concept or a principle we learned during our day?\n\nWhy are you so intolerant of theories, principles, and abstract intellectual conversations if they don't lead to something immediately tangible and concrete?\n\nWhy are you so predictable?  Are you really oblivious to your predictability or is it a matter of willful ignorance?\n\nWhy are you so obsessed with the way a message is presented and makes you "feel" when the content is valid?  \n\nWhy are you so quick to shut down anything that resembles an "argument" when in reality we are just verbalizing ideas?\n\n============\n\nI've been married to my ISFJ for 13 years...we got married as 18 year olds and it's been quite a journey.  Things in our marriage were great when I was an MBA/Corporate Salesman and all that comes with it (Traditional gender roles, stable and consistent paycheck, beautiful home on the lake, social status).  When I left that world in search of intellectual and artistic meaning and pursued my Ph.D. in Neuroscience, she really struggled with that, but was ultimately supportive.  She struggles with the questions she gets from her patients (she's a dental hygienist - a PERFECTjob for the ISFJ) relating to "so, what does your husband DO" - she liked it when she could give a one sentence answer that was easily understood and placed in a box for others to relate to.  The conflicts of ambiguity have been very hard for her.  She has also had to be more of the provider for our family as I invest more time and resources into all that goes with student life.\n\nThe conflicts in our marriage have arisen when she started listening to "them" - the social norm police.  It seems that for SJ types, the transgressing gender roles and social norms are grounds for justified criticism, judgment, and even hatred.  She used to be the defender of my quirks, but now she's slowly joined with "them".  So I need to vent.\n\n&#x200B;
35	Jeesh don't put all your wife's personality traits on us. That is a you and her thing.
19	All these traits you described are the stereotypical worst traits of an ISFJ, which is unfair. We could certainly make a list of those for ENTP as well....(insensitive, unaware, disorganized, argumentative). \n\nSounds like you two just have an unhealthy relationship. I dated an ENTP for almost two years and I loved hearing him talk about crazy unsubstantiated ideas, theories, concepts about the world and beyond. In general I feel that ISFJs love to listen and love to see people in their element. So if we are chatting with someone we care about and they are passionately discussing something that matters to them (that we may not quite understand), we listen intently! Just don’t expect us to debate you back. \n\nIn your case though it sounds like you two need to have a conversation about your differences and find a way to rectify them, or at least cut each other some slack when you disagree. Are the benefits you get from each other’s differences greater than the frustration? 
13	:(\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthere there..\*pats\*  sorry
7	I can tell you that I don't identify with how you last describe your wife: I don't identify as someone who is changing to accept the criticism and judgement of others for differences. (Edit addition- And that is the last thing I think I would do. We are weirdos and those of us who accept and embrace that seem to be happier for it.) That seems to be your problem because I can see how the rest of it may be somewhat reasonable criticism of the personality type. If you don't think you can get somewhere constructive talking to your wife about it, then you should look into involving a third party, like a couple's counselor. 
7	1. I think we tend to try to be fair, this one might be specific to your wife.\n\n2. Again, I don't think we purposefully act in manipulative ways. I treat people how I want to be treated, so yes, I expect the same in return.\n\n3. I think a lot of times we give and give without realizing how much of ourselves we've given away, and then we feel like we've been taken advantage of. It's one of the ways ISFJs self-handicap.\n\n4. This one doesn't resonate for me either.\n\n5. Being an ISFJ is often uncomfortable as we don't always feel like we fit in and spend a lot of time in our own heads. The energy and charisma of the ENTP can be really captivating.\n\n6. We mold ourselves to what the situation demands. I think of it as cognitive flexibility, not shallowness.\n\n7. I'm not your wife\n\n8. Predictability is comfortable, ambiguity is terrifying. I would rather settle for what I know than risk everything I have for something that *might* be better.\n\n9. I'm much more interested in what's real than what's theoretical. I want to relate to someone on a really real level, so I want to know what they do and think and love. I want concrete, not abstract.\n\n10. Talking in the hypothetical or theoretical realm feels, to me, like putting distance between myself and the other person. I want to know who they really are.\n\n11. Again, predictability is comfortable. I like a routine, I like to know what to expect, because I fear the unknown.\n\n12. We take things personally; we are sensitive to a fault. Paralinguistic cues and body language are part of the message you're sending me. If I feel like you're frustrated or angry with me, regardless of the content of what you're saying, I'm likely to shut down.\n\n13. See above. I'm highly likely to interpret an argument as a signal that you're unhappy with me.\n\n

4	You need to accept your isfj & all her quirks just as she accepts yours. She is grounded in reality, tradition & the past - the complete opposite of your type. Sensors have a hard time understanding/accepting intuition
3	\n\nThe thing is, she should have communicated the problem with you . She could have been straightforward about it.\n\nSeems your wife has insecurity issues
3	Then communicate it with your wife...simple solution
2	hmm...this is an eye opening post. \n\nThank you for sharing all this, it gives me a lot to think about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat sense of being "turncoated" on (unless you just outright feel betrayed) is one of the most painful experiences for an ENTP (and an INFJ).  \n\nWhy did she struggle with your choice to pursue your Ph.D?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are so many questions that I would like to ask you (being a spouse) about ISFJs as a spouse. I know they aren't all "the same" but I am quite certain that the fabric of their minds are all cut from the same cloth.   \n\n&#x200B;
1	Good post. I agree that these are many of my weaknesses that I am working on. I am definitely someone who isn't the healthiest of my type, mentally. However, for this:\n\n>Why are you so predictable? Are you really oblivious to your predictability or is it a matter of willful ignorance?\n\nI see our predictability as both a positive and a negative. I have an ENFP friend whose biggest weakness is her inconsistency. The reliability of an Si-dom is one of our strongest features. We work hard everyday towards our goals, and through sheer hard work do we eventually ensure that they are accomplished.\n\nThe negative is that we struggle to get out of our comfort zone. Isfjs purposefully stick to what we know because it is comfortable. In uncomfortable/unknown situations, our inferior Ne can run wild. \n\nI don't know much about the two of you, but it is what it is. I think, perhaps, you can learn a lot more from an ISFJ because our strengths are your weaknesses. Instead of just brushing her off as intellectually inferior and "different" I would suggest you try and understand her better (as you are doing by being here) and also little by little try to engage her in your world. It's actually strongly possible there's a lot going on in her head, but she feels intimidated because she respects your smarts so much. She probably fears getting into a discussion and making a fool of herself.
6	ISFJ music	i took the test with some of my colleagues at work today and while all of them had strong personality types (ENTJ, ENFP etc), i got ISFJ and i was considered the 'boring' one. i admit it bothered me more than i would want it to. i thought music would be a good distraction from thinking over the same thing again and again. i listen to piano pieces and OSTs a lot and while i listened to many after that convo, one particular OST just made me feel _me_. i felt like an ISFJ and it felt beautiful. its from Slumdog Millionaire - Latika's Theme. i'd love to know if some of you feel that way when you listen to a song. f you do, i'd be so happy to listen to it! listen to the song i mentioned and if you feel like i do, then man, that would be so cool. 
12	Don't trust this belief ISFJ's are boring. We are quiet and don't like to draw attention to us, but that is because we are humble and very observative of our surroundings, besides being very good listeners. So everyone has pros and cons. I love thievery corporation music, and specially a song called "Until the morning". I think it makes me feel "me" as you describe. 
3	I love love love korean music especially ballads and indie plus osts gosh wow you really made me feel not alone in this feeling 
2	Hmm. boring or not is all about perspective.. :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI love music too. I'm like you, I feel most like myself and almost in a safe happy bubble while I'm listening to music.. the music I listen to is a little different from my peers as well.. and yes, like you I love listening to piano pieces, OSTs(film/anime) too ! i love Latika's theme as well :D it makes me feel so warm, emotional, somehow nostalgic like a mother's calm loving hum for her child? ...now that I think about it, it is indeed very ISFJ-ish hehe.. :)
1	yeah!
1	love love loooove your collection!
1	I like metal. Gojira, Dissection, Sinsaenum, Goatwhore, etc.\n\nI also enjoy a lot of 90s grunge and such, some folk music, but... mostly metal.\n\n:)
3	So I think i've been mistyped...	(I posted this on r/ISFP earlier, so im also posting it here.)\n\nI decided to take the test again just because I haven't taken it in a while, and I was surprised when I got ISF**J**, not ISF**P**. So i decide to look through the description to see if there's any reason why it's different, besides the fact that my Judging and Perceiving has always been very balanced. There was one thing that resonated with me so much I knew I had to be an ISFJ.\n\n"*Given how generous Defenders are with their warm praise and support, it’s not surprising that others enjoy their company enough to call them friends. The challenge is to be considered a friend back – people with the Defender personality type are shy and a little protective of themselves, but they also need to be able to connect on a deeper emotional level. It makes sense then that most of Defenders’ friends are made not by random encounters on a wild night out, but through comfortable and consistent contact, as in class or in the workplace where they have the time to get to know each other little by little.*"\n\nThe person who I'd consider my closest friend, we only met a year ago, and it was by talking to each other consistently in class everyday our friendship grew. I think after reading this I was mistyped for a while. \n\nAs for how my results came out this time:\n\n- Introverted: 97%\n\n- Observant: 58%\n\n- Feeling: 86%\n\n- Judging: 54%\n\n- Turbulent: 64%\n\nSo i'm actually an ISFJ instead
1	I know how to make friends with an ISFJ now thanks
1	As a matter of fact, when your scores are in the middle you should always consider the option that you could be in the other dimension.\n\nType is natural so always look into your unfiltered, natural behavior. The past is also a good point to analyze for this. 
1	Study the functions I'd you really want to know. It it's also then that'll you'll see how far apart isfp and isfj is.
1	16 personality is largely agreed upon to be a bad cite in the community, and I’ve found most tests to be at best %75 percent accurate. If you want a more in depth test check out theses cites\n\n\nhttps://www.idrlabs.com/tests.php\n\n\n\nhttps://jung.test.typologycentral.com
10	I created a Music subreddit ... you peeps hop on it !	I think most people really underestimate how beautiful ISFJs Musicians can be. Moby is an ISFJ and I sure love his bits.\n\nIt's easy to confuse ISFJs and ISFPs. The way to tell them apart is that ISFPs are improvisers to a large degree. ISFJs are more properly skilled IMO. You lot portray tragedy really well. I would wager that the Coldplay dude is an ISFJ. [And this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oofSnsGkops) ???\n\nThe most surprising thing about you lot is comedy ! Surprisingly you peeps seem to inject comedy into music, which is jawbreakingly hilarious :D\n\nHere a few of those  \n\n1. [Tessa Violet - Crush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiAuAJBZuGs)\n2. [School of Rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bFsn2x7ppA)\n3. [4 chords](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlDewpCfZQ)\n4.

12	When/Why do you guys close people out?	I've noticed a shift in my S/O. He's more quiet, less excited bout things that used to make him happy. I can fell his energy shift, and just a general loss of interest. (idk maybe its just me his over lol). but otherwise, if this was you, and you had a S/O that could sense you've changed, how would you want me to approach you? or would you even want us to? I don't want to seem.. sensitive that I feel affected by his change but I guess I am worried I am tip toeing around it and it's too obvious to not address, but I dont want to offend him.
12	Much better to just ask him directly. Asking him would show him you’re paying attention, and also tell him what you think in a caring way.
6	ask him directly and be upfront about it\n\nwhat are the details? its okay  if you dont want to\n\n
8	This may or may not help, its definitely going to be situational: My SO is an ISFJ and every time he gets stressed he closes himself off and is noticeably distant. I have had quite a few conversations with him over the years about this and each time he will reassure me that it has nothing to do with me. He just needs time to get through his stress and his way to handle it is through being reserved. I've come to accept it now and he always ends up getting through it. 
4	its my pleasure...	Suppose, Lord willing, in the distant future I finally settle down with someone that I want to spend the rest of my life with. And for our anniversary I go up to her and say, "nothing will delight me more than to spend the evening with you tonight." She would never say to me, "Sam, you are so selfish. All you ever think about is what will bring you pleasure. That is why you asked me out tonight. Only because I make you satisfied." She would never say that because I am glorifying her satisfying qualities and holding her affections worthy of praise.  \n\nThis approach may appear very hedonistic but Duty, although necessary for a relationship isn't sufficient. \n\nWe don't glorify pleasure when we take supreme pleasure in enjoying somebody else. But rather, we are offering the highest of praise to our significant others. \n\nJust thoughts.

11	Similarities and difference between ISFJ and INFJ?	Hello ISFJ friends!\nI was wondering what are the similarities and difference between these two types are since I’ve scored for both throughout the years.
9	ISFJs are Si Doms. That means we are constantly doing mental comparisons between present and past to see if anything has changed. This makes us great at remembering important facts and putting them to practical use. We also tend to be great at noticing discrepancies in our environment. We tend to find comfort in routine and structure because the past is meaningful to us. One of the misconceptions about Si is that it lives completely in the past. On the contray, Si Doms use their past experiences to form future forecasts about what might happen and plan accordingly. We have more difficulty dealing with sudden changes because we can't compare this to past data (Inferior Ne).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nINFJs are Ni Doms. This means they are taking in conscious and unconscious information tinkering with it in their minds and creating a vision about what could happen. They are more attracted to philosophy (ISFJs can enjoy philosophy too but we would need to see the application of it, INFJs don't require this) and purely theoretical avenues. They distrust the past and pretty much live in the future. This is why they have difficulty living in the current moment and taking action in the immediate environment (Inferior Se). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBoth types use Auxilary Fe so both types will be polite and compassionate and focused on maintaining harmony in their environment. Both types will absorb outer emotions like a sponge. Both types enjoy having good relationships with friends and family. Both types when healthy will try to make decisions about what will maintaining harmony and try to produce positive results for the people involved. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBoth types will develop and enjoy using Teritary Ti later in life. This mainfests in wanting to have a logical basis for personal decisions. Also, in analyzing and researching information about our interests. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
7	[Here](https://reddit.com/r/infj/comments/905xaj/the_difference_between_isfj_and_infj_si_vs_ni/) is my go-to comparison of Si vs Ni with bonus analysis of how/why the mbti community mischaracterizes both. [deleted] did their homework and uses Jung as their primary source. I personally think it’s the best Si vs. Ni description you can find on reddit. \n\n\n\n“As other users have noted, there are quite a few ISFJ's (and INFP's) mistyped as INFJ's. I've been asked in a few comments / messages to describe the differences, so I wanted to create a post.\n\n\nSi & Ni Similarities:\n\n\nBoth can be "in their heads" (and often are! It's core to both functions)\nBoth can operate in the unconscious (and do! Again, this is core to the definition of both)\nBoth can read between the lines and derive insights (including "a ha" moments)\nBoth can have "gut feelings," and develop subjective understanding\nBoth can think abstractly on occasion\nBoth can go against tradition, convention on occasion\nBoth can have imperfect memories or miss details on occasion\nBoth can plan for the future (and in fact, many SJ's highly enjoy doing so!)\nSi & Ni Differences:\nSi pertains to "the real world" (even when they're making insights or thinking)\nNi is directly at odds with it\n"What does that mean??"\nWell, it doesn't just mean being "in our head" or "drawing conclusions" - that's VERY fundamental to both types\n\n\nThe real question is what it's regarding / a result of / in relation, and what their core drive / value / focus is\n\n\nSi prefers concrete and familiar - even though they can absolutely draw insights, abstract, and think, the core drive of "concrete," "familiar," and/or "stable," etc. is fundamental to their life (some Si's identify with different words)\nNi doesn't. They don't care. Rather, they need and want abstract (not just "thinking" or "insights") as a core value\n\n\n\nWhat Si isn't:\nAlways traditional or conventional - they often are, but don't have to be!\nAlways past-oriented or have great memories - often, but not always!\nAlways literal, or unable to abstract, be insightful, creative, etc. - they absolutely can!\nAlways detailed - they're humans too, and can miss things\n\n\nWhat Ni isn't:\nJust being "in our head," "thinking," or "detached" - this describes most introverted types\n"Si 2.0" or "the best of both worlds" - Ni-doms fundamentally don't care about the core Si values and strengths\nSomething we "back into" simply because we "don't identify fully with Si" (Ni-doms live and breathe Ni)\nSomething defined by occasionally thinking abstractly or having insights (see above: Ni-doms live and breathe Ni)\n\n\n\nAccording to Jung:\nSi perceives something with "all its qualities, its intensity, its transient course, the nature of its origin and disappearance in their every detail"\nNi, on the other hand, "obtains either no knowledge at all or at the best a very inadequate awareness" of the thing at hand; in fact, their "chief repression" is "sensation of the object" (note: this goes further than "being unaware of our surroundings")\n\n\n\nSi: absolutely perceives unconsciously, but still regards "the object" or "image" (comes from and/or ties back to real life or things they've experienced/read/seen/etc, even if not in front of them at the time)\n\nNi: has a "remarkable indifference" to “anything outside their unconscious pursuit” (note: this isn't just "being in our head;" this is an overarching abstraction or vision for life or consciousness) including the real world, and live in the unconscious "without establishing any connection between the phenomenon and himself" (which is not just being "in our head," "thinking," or introversion)\n\n\nSi is often characterized by "calmness," "rational self-control," and "well-intentioned neutrality... striving to soothe and adjust."\nNi on the other hand, doesn't care about "tangible reality" and makes no such adjustments, rendering his himself "unadapted to the actual present-day reality." (and again: this is not just "being introverted")\n"I still don't get it..."\nLeave a comment or PM me\n\n\n\nWhy do we mistype?\nThe #1 reason: we're not good at self-perception. We all see ourselves a bit inaccurately, and skew perception\nThe tests are almost always wrong\nThe type and function language and definitions are confusing\nWe all see a little bit of ourselves in all of the functions / types\nWe may extrapolate a few examples of a function (i.e., insights, abstract) into meaning we're that type\nWe don't identify with everything about a function/type description (especially stereotypes, many of which are wrong)\nWe compare ourselves to the "stereotype" rather than users/types in real life\nWe unknowingly comparing ourselves to real-life Si's rather than Ni's (i.e., "I'm not like A, so I must be B" or "I'm more X than A, so I must be B" rather than "I am B.") Ni-dom's are ~3% ofpeople whereas Si users are ~46% (Si-dom's, ISxJ, specifically are 25%; S's overall are 75%.) So we're often finding comparing and small differentiations against S's rather than N's\nOn a cursory read, we may simply like the idea of N over S (without understanding the downsides of N, or the fact that it directly contradicts some S drives/values/needs)\n\n\n\nWhat can we do?\nThe opposite of everything above.\nBe self-aware, open, honesty about what we value / do most - avoid confirmation bias and really explore other types*\nDon't go off of test results\nLearn about the functions, how they work together, what each values and what each doesn't\nUnderstand we can all exhibit something from each type on occasion\nAvoid cherry-picking examples as proof of a function; we live and breathe our dominant function\nUnderstand that we don't have to identify 100% with the description (especially bad stereotypes!)\nUnderstand Si's in real life, rather than the Si stereotype / archetype\nUnderstand (actual) Ni's in real life (but be aware: many people are mistyped)\nUnderstand the weaknesses, blind spots, values for each type (incl Ni) and be honest about your real values/needs\n*I have explored whether I am an Si-dom with seriousness - I hired a certified MBTI coach to help me filter this, explicitly telling her I could be Si-dom\nThe best resource is a very well-read MBTI coach. I hired two different ones, one of whom was "certified," to help me confirm my type. There was no test - it was all conversational. Both walked me through typing as Ni-dom.\nThat aside? Well-read MBTI nerds who aren't basing understandings off of stereotypes, mistypes, and bad information”\n\n\n\nEdit to correct username\n\n\n
3	ISFJs are very practical, organized, caring, and help out with a lot of things for their love ones\n\nINFJs are also organized, caring, and organized, but they are extremely future-oriented, and has high intuition\n\nBoth are perfectionist, sensitive, and likes to hang out with their friends and family(ambrivert). 
5	Need help finding a suitable career path for me, but I’m at a loss	I currently work in pest control, I like helping people, investigating problems, fixing problems, and the most important aspect is having the freedom to do what I believe needs to be done without a manager standing over me and the autonomy I have of when to take lunch/bathroom/which stops to run.\n\n\nWhat I don’t like is the 12-14 hour days, having pesticides get on me, never knowing if a service will be added to me at 2pm that adds 2-3 hours to my day, always having to act like it’s “4th and goal, super bowl, game is tied” every single day, tired of dealing with bedbugs and roaches, plus all types of weather. \n\nI tested as infp a month ago, but the test I took in a book says that I’m an isfj, which describes me to a T. Now, They say do what tends to come easy to you, and things that people compliment you on, besides “Computers” I don’t think I have anything \n\nI don’t think I’m that good with computers anyway, it takes me half a day to search google, I get frustrated give up and come back days even weeks later. To think I had to do that with a boss demanding faster and faster completion timed, not to mention I don’t want to ever work 2nd shift again or ever work 3rd shift (adhd medicine in morning let’s me actually get to work plus I’m very routine and feel a little foggy if it’s thrown off), add in the constant interruptions and the assumed zero down time to just recharge and work in a burst of energy, I think I’d be just as miserable as I am now, maybe more because I’d be new and more likely to be fired. \n\n\nI know this sub is smaller than the one I thought I was, but hopefully someone out there can offer some sage advice 
5	I went into nursing. \n\nLong shifts, yeah, but it makes me feel like I’m doing something with my life, and I enjoy it. 
3	I’m in nursing school right now. Really enjoy it so far. I think it seems like the ideal career for a lot of ISFJs. 
2	What types of things to do you enjoy doing? What would you do even if you didn’t get paid for it?
1	Retail Shop assistant (not food) , mentor, 
1	I'm in no position to give any advice to you, but what do you like? Try to explore all the options, or opportunities available to you. May take time, but I think it's for best if you explore your opportunities and then decide. 
1	.
1	ISFJs tend to be good providers, that's why I believe many of us choose a career path such as nursing where you have to support and care about other people. Nevertheless and regardless of the MBTI type, nursing isn't the only option available. I'm currently trying to find my way into IT because I've always liked to fiddle with computers ever since I can remember. IT is a vast field, there are plenty of options if what you want to do is deal with other people's computer issues. I would actually like to do nursing or similiar jobs but since IT is my passion I'm trying to go that way first. In the end no one can tell you for sure what you should do because only you know what you like to do, and if you don't, it might help you to try new different things and see what sticks.
1	im so sorry\n\nIf you dont want your current job, i suggest you reflect and find another one that suits you the most.\n\nFinding a new career is great but take note that you also have to spend dollars to travel to companies depending on travel distance if you want to get out from your miserable job. I suggest you stay like couple of months and earn money and when youve already earned enough funds to take care of yourself, thats the time you should give your resumes away to companies on linkd or jobstreet. \n\nIt will take time and patience though.\n\nare you earning well or is your salary below minimum?
1	I’m in automotive repair and have been for nearly 20 years. It’s a nice balance between extending care, being detail oriented, and largely not having to deal with the general public. Also pays pretty well because it’s been seen as a “lower” skilled profession for quite some time so there aren’t many people interested/qualified to do it and is in high demand in a lot of locations. \n\nThink of it as nursing, only the patient is mechanical and might only get one occasional visitor. 
17	Can we talk about Fe? Here's what frustrates me:	Extroverted Feeling (Fe) can be a chore, for me, as I run one million miles out of the way to accommodate someone. \n\nI over emphasize with people when we're face to face to the point where I love them completely all faults included, only to step away and realize again they are still terrible.\n\nThat paradox makes me feel two-faced.\n\nI'll listen to a conversation and empathize so intently, never thinking of what it is that I want to say back, never having my own agenda in mind, seeking only to understand completely, that when it's expected for me to reply I have nothing to say.\n\nMy strengths; super empathy, kindness and low self orientation seem to be perceived as a disadvantage and weakness in this world.\n\nAnyone relate? Anything about Fe you enjoy instead?
6	Having Fe third, I can understand but not totally relate. (PS: However I had a lot to say apparently)\n\nIt's likely you (ISFJ, followed by INFJ and maybe ExFJ) are the most prone to being unable to say no, and finding yourself doing things you would rather not agree to. To add to that natural propensity, people are probably more prone to turn to when they want something than any other type, because you always appear to be up for it (best case scenario), or because you're easy to abuse (worst case scenario).\n\nUltimately, you will need to force yourself to say no. Realise that you are going above and beyond what is generally expected. Realise some of the people that you do stuff for are using you (whether voluntarily or not). I always ask myself "would they do it for me?". Then I usually end up doing more for people than they'd do for me, but it's easier to accept not going out of your way for them, or not going the extra mile. For starters, if you can't say no, at least stop offering help to those people.\n\nGo and see about setting boundaries in r/INFJ, the subject comes up fairly often and they might have better insight than me.\n\nListening without thinking of what you'll answer is often suggested as a way of creating actual conversations. The silence once they stop talking and you are poundering and maybe coming up with something else is not ackward if you accept it. Just don't feel rushed to say something, let it be there, it's fine I swear. People can see you actually thinking about what they said, and they mostly like it. At worst it will push people to expand more. \n\nHaving learned/discovered/developed Fe later I love it. Ti can tell if an idea is logically consistent, but there's no measure of how valuable/important/meaningful something is outside of F functions. \n\nI guess it can be overwhelming to have that scale be so strong and based on other people. I guess you need to learn to also take care of yourself. \n\nAgain, something I've seen recommended multiple times in INFJ and that probably applies: journalling, talking to yourself in the mirror or even video journalling. They help apply that Fe to yourself and focus on taking care of yourself (eg you know you could see it and advise against it if another ISFJ was going to far to help others, way clear than you see it when you do. The same will happen when actually looking at yourself, apparently)
3	I’ve been struggling with this same thing recently!!!! \nI do enjoy sharing in others happiness!! (Who doesn’t!)\n-either nothing to say or what I suggest (which makes sense to me) doesn’t apply to them 
2	i relate to kindness such as when there are visitors, i would invite them to eat with our family. Other than that, when someone needs help in their final output i would send right away my copy. I can also read other peoples emotions too. \n\nFor the weaknesses, well, passive aggressiveness and i choose my battles well to avoid burden and burn out. Im picky especially when meeting new people and i find it hard to trust someone . Even though im already close to that person, i wont say much about my business. Sure i can open up but in bits and pieces only. Usually i end being a listener. I can be judgemental and yet at the same time be open to new ideas\n\nlow self orientation is very true to me lool but thats because, for me, ive learned to get used to it. It just sucks to have low self esteem.\n\n
3	MBTI & Music Survey (Redesign) - Need respondents!	I created an initial version of this survey a few days ago, but after receiving feedback and reviewing many of the responses, I restructured it to increase accuracy, depth, and easier data analysis. Even if you've already taken the previously posted survey, please take this new one as well.\n\nThis is a survey searching for correlation between MBTI and musical interests such as genres, instruments, singing, dance, and composition/production. Once I get a descent amount of responses, I will post the results in [r/mbti](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti) (unless [r/isfj](https://www.reddit.com/r/estj) would like me to post them here as well). I've created individual surveys for each of the 16 personality types, and the one below is SPECIFICALLY for ISFJs.\n\nThe ISFJ survey link:\n\n[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JRCGKN3](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JRCGKN3) \n\n​\n\nIf you are not an ISFJ please find the correct link for your type here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9a6hbw/mbti\_music\_survey\_redesign\_need\_respondents/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9a6hbw/mbti_music_survey_redesign_need_respondents/)\n\n​\n\nThanks for your responses! As I said previously, I will post the results and analysis in [r/mbti](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti) once the survey is completed.
1	Completed.\nThis almost seems a little too straight forward with these types of questions. 
32	ISFJs are the real MVPs! (-ISTJ)	No seriously, you guys are amazing! I know a few ISFJs including close friend and my mom, and you guys are awesome 👏🏼 much appreciation \n\nVery similar to me but also much more caring and warm towards others. I even observe you just to learn from you. \n\nSometimes I think i need ISFJ rather then ESFP/ESFJ\n\n
10	wow, ISTJ *expressing* their appreciation for us \*looks out of the window to see if pigs are flying\* :p  ..lol I kid, thankyou.. i love ISTJs too :)
15	ISFJ, the Saviour of INTP???	Alone. Unloved. Miserable.\n\n​\n\nAfter I lost my (ISFJ) mother and the one other (ISFJ female) person that would listen to my analytical ramblings of passion, life was hell.\n\n​\n\nMy father shamed me and told me that I was autistic. My sister that I loved most, found me annoying, lame, and repulsive.\n\n​\n\nI gave up my one activity that joined by problem-solving nature with an expression of emotion: Music. ... My emotions were no longer ex-pressed, so they began to be re-pressed. My health took a noise-dive.\n\n​\n\nWhen I stumbled upon Quiet, by Susan Cain, I felt so loved and understood that I wanted to jump for joy - which was unusual for my thoughtful and internalized personality.\n\n​\n\nYears later, when I discovered MBTI, I found that I was an INTx and I just kept shouting "Yes! Yes!" as I read about others with my same difficulties, loves, weaknesses, and strengths.\n\n​\n\nFinally, I realized that I am not an INTJ:\n\n1. decisive\n2. dresses formally\n3. tends to dislike physical touch\n4. does not require emotional or social validation from others.\n\n​\n\nInstead, I test clearly as an INTP:\n\n1. indecisive\n2. dresses casually and creatively\n3. tends to crave physical touch, caressing, and hugging\n4. desperately seeks emotional or social validation, which is inconvenient because INTPs crave mainly non-social environments.\n\n​\n\nAlso, INTPs and find it extremely draining to maintain most social relationships. Showing up in a way that is agreeable to others, especially extroverts, is like balancing a stack of books on my head: it is an enjoyable challenge for about 30 seconds, and then from that point on, it is painfully inconvenient.\n\n​\n\nEver since my family saw the Matrix (1999), I felt a special connection with Neo. I idealized Neo. I pretended I was Neo. I put Neo in my artwork. I only stopped referencing Neo once I reached the age when I felt to intimidated to be freely creative in my own geeky way. ... It was just this week that I realized that Neo was symbolic of an INTP living his/her full destiny and "learning to fly".\n\n​\n\nNow. A recognition of my "better half": the ISFJ or Defender personality. ... I can already tell a difference in my ability to love and accept myself, even before I have found an actual friend or lover who is an ISFJ (female).\n\n​\n\nSo even the idea of there being a group of people out there who would be happy to know me. And who I could make happy without me wearing a social mask, without me pretending to be someone that I'm not: is incredibly refreshing.\n\n​\n\nI read a post from an ISFJ female who mentioned that she thought that we INTPs aren't attracted to ISFJs. And I just want to clear the record to say that just that thought of you ISFJs, let alone your actual presence, is to us INTPs completely:\n\n1. endearing\n2. inspiring\n3. adorable\n4. attractive\n5. life-saving.\n\n​\n\nI believe that the ISFJ female I'm mentioning had just gone through a painful breakup with an INTP. ... And for what it is worth, just like I gave up my love of music for years because I thought that it "wasn't practical and wasn't actually helping anyone in need", we INTPs sometimes can forget how much our love for art and love for each other is ever so practical for health, happiness, and is so worth upholding.\n\n​\n\nSome people refer to ISFJs as \*fake\*. And to INTPs like me, ISFJs help us remember that love is \*real\*, and life is \*really\* worth living.\n\n​\n\nGod/Universe bless all of you ISFJs wherever you are. I love you forever. -INTP
3	You just posted the exact same post at the ISTJ subreddit?!
1	Hope you are doing well. How's your health now? 
1	My boyfriend is an INTP. I like to think we balance each other out a lot. 
1	No no no no no I (INTP) will never ever be around an ISFJ if I don’t have to 
1	Among other things, my enduring love of ISFJs makes me question my own type. Although I typically feel more introverted, being around an ISFJ makes me feel like a genuinely social creature. It doesn't hurt that ISFJs have told me that they could listen to me talk through philosophical tangents indefinitely. Si and Fe are definitely the "energies" that I consciously value and crave from the world; I'm just shaky on the ordering. 
2	Good first message for an ISFJ (online dating)	Hi all, titles says it all I guess. \nSometimes I think a profile may be ISFJ (and hope it is maybe..), and was wondering what would you guys personally like to get as a first message / what are you more likely to answer or not answer?\n(I'm male 31, looking for female, serious more than hookups)\n\nI submitted a [similar question in INFJ](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/99p9v0/good_first_message_for_an_infj_online_dating/)\n
19	I would recommend that you approach the person as a person, not as a personality type, preferably be yourself.\nIf it's meant to be, it's meant to be.
4	Just as the other person said,  be yourself! More importantly be genuine.  If you're looking for a long term, serious relationship, possible "the one" then you'll have to be unapologetically yourself. \n\nI met my partner (who has a similar personality type) online and he literally just sent me a message saying "Hey, how's it going?". We've been together for two and a half years and I'm confident his the one! \n\nMy point being, just be yourself and if you come across the right person for you then it'll all work out. \n\nBest of luck! \n\n
1	Comment on something particular in her profile (shows you read what she had to say, which she will appreciate). Compliment her on how beautiful she looks. Above all, be genuine in your compliment! Don’t say something generic or boring 
2	ISFJ or ISTJ? Please settle once and for all, please.	
4	Things that make you sound unlike me and the ISFJs I know:\n>I'm often described as being detached and careless at times\n\n>I'm also described as harsh and inconsiderate when telling people what's on my mind\n\n>usually fail to understand hints and what not, unless if it's communicated clearly, chances are I'll miss it.\n\n\nAlmost never.\n\n\n\n>If I'm not convinced by a task or if it's contradicts with a value of mine, I won't do it, I would go as far as quitting a job if I feel it doesn't satisfy my goals or that I'm not going forward or being held down by management, despite following rules and regulations I'd rebel if I feel that I'm being treated unfairly and would walk away if my rightful demands aren't met (I am usually reasonable and realistic in my demands and I don't go overboard with them).\n \nIt depends. I think it would take a lot for an ISFJ to act similarly. If I had to describe my own work experience, that would be the last thing I focused on. I would talk about how I try to anticipate people's needs and what they /mean/ when they ask me to do a specific task I think is silly. I bite my tongue a lot when I see mismanagement, if I think that a person means well and isn't doing that much harm. \n\nThese differences all seem to be related to Fe, which is a pretty good inclination of Te auxiliary on your part. \n\n
1	ISTJ (Te not Fe)
4	ISFJs and retirement	Hi everyone, love from an INFP\n\nMy mother is an ISFJ who's retired in the last couple of years. Almost every day she says she's bored and doesn't know what to do. She's dabbled in many hobbies over the years (including different forms of painting) but nothing has stuck. She loses interest quickly and her reasons for quitting are often people-based e.g. she couldn't get along with the others in the group. She's good at many things but she underrates herself and doesn't stick with anything long enough to improve or to fulfill her life\n\nWhat hobbies would you guys recommend? How do you stick to them?\n\nAlso, any tips for making friends?\n\nThank you thank you thank you\n\n
8	I just have problems sticking to hobbies in general, with the acceptation of binge watching shows. Maybe try an instrument like a piano, you can get a cheap keyboard off of amazon. 
6	This is weird, I do too but I never thought about it.
4	(ISFJ here) I rotate between hobbies like crazy. Reading, video games, playing music, doing embroidery, coloring.. You name it. The problem is I never get too good at something, but I do like having varied interests. And I don't get bored with them.\n\nedit: I can understand why your mom wouldn’t like something because of the group of people. For me, the activities I stick to the most involve socializing because I enjoy the company of people I like. I am part of a few meet ups. But I don’t have the time or energy for all of them so I am currently deciding which ones I thrive from the most. So maybe she needs to find a group or meet up with people she likes. That could be very invigorating.
2	I found toast masters helped with the group, although for mine it was up to you how involved you became. I got more involved in organising and helping then the front speaking parts 
0	How long to dtr?	How long of dating someone does it take for you to know you want to commit exclusively to them? When do you start thinking about the future?
3	as someone who is dating an ISFJ (and doesn't want to rush them but is curious)..I  would like to know this answer as wells so I am following... 
2	Can't speak for all ISFJs, but I believe we're known to put a lot of effort, care, and affection into our relationships, and personally I very much prefer to DTR earlier rather than later. Really depends on the partner, but for me and my current boyfriend, I knew it was going to be something special from the beginning, and were exclusive from the start of us seeing each other.

3	Is this what inferior Ne is?	I've noticed a lot of times I'll observe 1+ things occurring which seem odd/inexplainable to me at the moment. I'll think, "Hmm. How peculiar. What could this detail indicate". However, I often times lack the complete inability to connect things together in a story, giving an explanation as to the existence of that detail in the context, and I miss things which are pretty obvious after the matter of fact.\n\nE.g. There's this show I sometimes watch, and there's this side character who came every now and then, but they really didn't have a big role. They was just sorta...there. But they were put in the spotlight much more than a side character should, at least in my eyes. I always subconsciously questioned why he was there, but I just told myself to keep watching instead. \n\nThen, there's a sudden reveal, and turns out that the person is the major villain. I started yelling "How did I NOT see that coming?? It made sense! They were always such an unsuspicious character, and yet they were almost always there." \n\nIt's like my brain is too lazy to come up with possible explanations, or I simply can't on the spot. And then, when the answers are shown, suddenly I am slamming my head wondering why I couldn't have figured that out earlier.\n\nCan any of you relate, or is this a me thing?
2	From my understanding, attempting to connect things into a larger framework is actually a part of introverted thinking(Ti), which is our tertiary function, which would explain the difficulties you/I would have with it. Inferior Ne is more characterized by the inability to deal with infinite possibilities/choices and the inability to sort through them effectively. Personally, looking back on it for me, I could kinda see how my struggle with Inferior Ne manifested itself like, for example, when it came to choosing majors, women, or just paths in life in general, I was overwhelmed by how to discriminate among them effectively, and if we want to go even deeper than that, when it came to my own religion, Inferior Ne led me to an existential crisis because I couldn't reconcile how out of the million of forms and shapes that religion could take, my religion somehow ended up being/looking like what it is today, which in my mind started to look so incredibly arbitrary, which ended up being very difficult to reconcile. However, learning to coming to terms with my inferior function(Ne) taught me a lot about myself, about the world, about my weaknesses/limitations, and in the end made me a much more rounded out person because I had to learn to use/develop the weaker parts of myself that I struggled with as much as I could in order to move forward in life(I say as much as I could because, as you may know, Jung believed that we will always be, more or less, the least skilled, the least confident and the least differentiated with our inferior function.
4	Anyone else have trouble compartmentalizing when strangers/acquaintances look a lot like people from your past	I just realized this is something that I’ve been doing my whole life. \n\n\nIt’s not like calling people the wrong names.  It’s more like smiling way too familiarly at a bus driver that looks recognizably like a dude who I was massively infatuated with a few years ago. Or it’s like the time I was getting to know a girl who looked a lot like a childhood friend of mine, and I had to monitor myself because I was feeling prematurely comfortable around her.  \n\nI’m wondering if this is a Si-dom thing, but I’d also just like to hear people’s stories because it’s kind of hilarious to me. 
4	Yes, I always develop interest in people that resemble people from my past or ones I love.. always, either in appearance or personality-wise..\n\nI developed crushes on guys  that resemble my ex or other serious crushes from the past.\n\nI feel genuinely interested, find a soft spot for people - even celebrities that remind me of my dad / mom / friends / anyone I am close to.
4	I had a crush on Tom DeLonge from Blink 182 15 years back because he kind of looked like a guy I liked in one picture. \n\n(I eventually dated that guy and we’re now married)
2	Definitely..... the most prominent and specific example for me being that there’s a member of a certain kpop band who I can barely stand to look at because his face reminds me of the person who caused me the most intense heartbreak I’ve experienced so far. \n\nIt’s odd because I’m not generally good with faces, but certain types of face will give me a very strong negative reaction based on past bad experiences with people who looked similar. Not sure if the same is true for positive experiences though, hmm.... 
3	ISTP and ISFJ?	ISFJ's; whats your experience been with ISTP's? And do you think they work well together? (both are healthy)
3	I’m 25F and one of my best relationships/strongest love was an ISTP male. I fucking love that type. Their intensity melts me and I love the challenge of cracking open their shell and getting to the soft/emotional interior. ISTPs are so relaxed, aloof and go with the flow which I love to be around—it chills me out immensely. They have a quiet confidence which is super sexy and refreshing compared to a loud attention seeking extrovert. 
1	Not one of those types but my parents are exactly that: \nMy dad is ISTP and mom is ISFJ.\n\nThey have been together for about 50 years so I’d say it worked well in their case.\n\n
1	I have an ISTP friend from college and we get along well and enjoy and laugh when we’re together. :) 
4	Hey guys! :) What is your enneagram type?	Mine is 5w4 sx/sp, uncertain about my tritype (well, my dom type is maybe wrong too,haha)
5	2w1
4	5w6
3	I’m 5w6 too!
2	9w1
2	6w5!
2	1W2
1	Just took a test and I'm 9w1.. got to read up on it!
1	9w1
1	9w1
1	9! I forget which wing
1	2w1
1	3w4
1	I’m a 6, still new to enneagram so I’m unsure of my wing as of right now.
1	9w1
1	9w1, seems to be pretty common here.
1	6w5 or 9. Can't figure it out for the life of me. I keep going back and forth.
8	Tell me something non-stereotypical about yourself! :)	I'm just now learning how tiny aspect is MBTI of a human being. Althoug it can help to understand some actions of a person, we shouldn't forget that we are guided by muuuuch more than just four letters. What is your 'thing' that doesn't really fit your type's stereotypes? \nMine is that I love multitasking. For example,when I'm cooking (hahha, I said non-stereotypical, didn't I?) always do bunch of stuff at the same time. Maybe that's why I end up burning down the house. ;)
12	My memory is straight-up awful. \n\nLike, short term memory is extremely spotty, and I have relatively few memories of growing up even though I’m only 23. Maybe 1-3 snapshot memories per year from the start of my memory through high school, and maybe 8-10 snapshot memories per year of the more recent stuff. People talking about how ISFJs will remember everything about the people they love always makes me super insecure lol.
9	I don’t really take it slow in relationships! I’ve been the sexual initiator in the relationships I’ve been in (surprise bc I’m so shy), and when I date someone, I tend to fall hard and fast. Sure spending time with helps to get to know a person better but I’m very impatient and love to love them immediately!! \n\nAlso, yes I keep to the social rules as much as possible, but sometimes idgaf and speak what’s directly on my mind and that can be mean or seen as inappropriate and will sometimes get called out on and if does I get defensive and am ready to fight (although I don’t ever!)\n
7	I am very confrontational. If someone's doing something that needs to be changed I'm the first one to bring it up.  
6	Music production is my jam 
6	Can't seem to find a way to organize myself with things I want to do, I feel so overwhelmed most of the time
3	I'm a little scatter-brained and tend to be forgetful.. my memory is bad too, like the other ISFJ said.. but I always remember those moments which are connected to a feeling, I even remember a fuzzy glimpse of my 1st birthday.. I tend to be forgetful about 'he said and then she said, and then I said', type of stuff. \n\nI do multi-tasking too :D ..sometimes I do well, sometimes fail lol. \n\nAnd, I don't follow any religion, but I believe in God though. 
2	I actually don’t mind breaking rules that I think are stupid or don’t make sense to me. 
2	I am very in touch with my emotions and can discuss them easily. 
13	Which MBTI type is that you fall for very quickly?	Hey guys! I was searching about this in this subreddit, but I haven't found anything.... so I was curious which MBTI type do you prefer romantically? :)\nMy weak spots are ENTPs,hehe. Ahhh... I would just listen them all day long... I seriously admire how their brain works. 
11	INFPs like a bad habit.
10	ISFJs and INFJs, generally. They're the best fit for this NTP. :) Actually, realizing that I had a romantic preference for introverts was one pivotal piece of evidence for me when I first began questioning my type. I'm still not sure which NTP variant I am, but I've actually heard "Please never stop talking" from an ISFJ gal before, for what it's worth. :)  
8	xNTP types. It's such a ridiculous match, but it's so great! I've been with my INTP for nearly 9 years and we are so different, but we both know each other's personalities so well. He's logical and I'm emotional. We compliment each other and together create something very well balanced. \n\nIf any of you have xNTP attractions, I would say to go for it and hopefully you'll find a totally opposite, yet incredibly thought provoking person to share your emotional insights with! 
7	Probably ESFPs tbh. They're so freaking confident and "cool". They can make you feel like the most important person in the world. And, everyone around you seems to be in complete awe of them.\n\nENTP's I started to admire more as I got older. I found them to be quite dorky and weird in my youth :P 
6	XNTPs forever, and to my disadvantage. 
3	I love Entps so big! Been with mine for almost three years, Best relationship ever!!!
2	No particular type to be honest\n\nI've liked different kinds from ESTP to INTJ to ENTP to I think it was INFP?\n\nHonest for me I see the appeal in all types and its kinda more I just like who I can make a good connection with in some way haha
2	Cool. I fall for entp/intj/ENTJ because i like to control them(it's fun). Anything NF are my pets/mistresses. ISFJ feels like marriage but whether it lasts depends on me (i hate breaking it off with ISFJ)
2	INFPs/INTPs, but I’d say I like feelers more. INTPs tend to not be a good match for me, specifically regarding personal values. \n\nEither way, both of these combinations can be difficult. INFP are not very good at expressing their emotions and tend to not want to discuss issues that might come up. They also are a bit impulsive with their emotions and don’t think them through often before making a decision. However I think they are so sweet and think a romantic relationship (if you work through some patches) can work out. \n\nINTPs and I have amazing chemistry, but the last one I almost got in an relationship with I realized would not be a good match long term for *either* of us. We were similar, yet so different at the same time. 
2	I am attracted to introverted guys in general, but I think there is no certain MBTI type that I quickly fall for. I tend to fall for a guy when they show me that they are interested to me more than I am interested with them and when there is a mutual attraction and similar interests. But to give you an idea, my ex was an ISFx, he’s my first boyfriend and we’ve dated for 4 years. He was kind and a gentleman but we are not intellectually compatible so I lost interest and fell out of love.\n\nAfter dating IRL, I tried online dating and the first guy who showed interest to me was an INFx, but didn’t workout since he wasn’t interested in a relationship. Next guy was an INTP, didn’t workout because he’s from another country and dated another woman IRL and told me about it, I didn’t want to stay friends so I blocked him and completely erased him from my life Lol. And currently, an INFP who never stopped messaging me until I replied and consistent with his interest and communication with me. We are now considering making our relationship official next year because we are exclusively dating and I have this feeling that he’s the one. I just can’t stop overthinking and overanalyzing the relationship sometimes because of our differences, and I fear rejection and being unhappy in the long run if I choose to be with him, but we’re always able to talk things out calmly and he understands my emotion so it’s really good. I can say that I am really starting to fall in love with him though he said “I love you” first. :)

1	I do really admire ENTPs in some ways too....although they usually piss me off after a while due to their lack of awareness. I’m very strongly attracted to ISTPs physically. ESTPs always get my attention since they are often the center of attention and I like their unemotional strength. ESFPs are great too. \n\nI’m very strongly J so the P types are refreshing for me....particularly xSxP types. Their chilled out personalities put me in a relaxed and peaceful state immediately. \n\nI also have a soft spot for INTJs. They are fascinating and have the sexiest minds. \n\nI dated an ISFP once, but that didn’t work out. He was too “soft” and gentle for me. \n\nTypes I don’t click with well in a dating sense: INFJ (although my best friend is...), ESTJ, ESFJ, ENFJ, fellow ISFJs, ISTJ\n
1	Trying to rekindle a friendship with an isfj...any advice?	INFP/F/25\nThanks for taking the time to read and I appreciate any insight and suggestions! \n\nLong story short, I roomed with an ISFJ in an apartment a year ago. We met in college and became close friends and roomed together our sophomore year as well. We grew apart when I started dating and getting really close to this guy. I spent (and still spend) a lot of time with him. She didn’t like him and I think she thought I valued him more than I valued our friendship. In hindsight, I shouldn’t have put him above my other friendships...I was so excited to really click and genuinely be in love with someone that I accidentally started to blow off some of my friends and family. \n\nShe never told me why she didn’t like him. Instead, she was extremely passive aggressive and rude to him whenever he came over. She acted more like my mom than my friend and that really pissed me off. I know she probably saw it as “helping” and trying to look out for me, but I saw it as controlling and rude. I used to really value her opinion and talk to her for advice, but when I got into a habit of thinking a bit more for myself and not telling her everything, she started to get distant and pissy. It’s like she enjoyed me being dependent on her and consulting her for everything. I tried to talk things out with her on several different occasions but she blew me off each time, so eventually I gave up and started being rude back to her. \n\nFast forward a year and a half-we both apologize to each other and have hung out a couple times, one on one for much over the span of the past few months. It’s gone well, but we’re not near as close as we used to be. She seems to have grown a lot as a person and I feel like I did too. She reached out to me first so I think she’s wanting to rebuild our friendship too. We used to share the same friend group but she was friends with them first so I’ve stepped back and haven’t made an attempt to hang out with them because I was introduced through her. \n\nI know this is probably a weird question but how do I pursue this friendship without seeming needy or awkward? How do I make the most of this? She reached out to me first, and then I reached out so would it be her turn to reach out to me again to hang out? 
4	If you want to rebuild the friendship, don’t worry about whose turn it is. Starting behaving how you envision you would if the relationship were more developed. That’s invitation enough for her to open up again. 
3	I think that the main thing is just understanding yourself and also understanding what her needs are or how she might perceive things you do, even if you didn’t intend it that way. Maybe you two can discuss your personality types and just lay out on the table what your different needs from the friendship are and just let her know that she is valued to you. Lay down your boundaries that you’ve decided on as far as how much time you are willing to spend with her or other friends and what time is for your significant other, then communicate it so it is understood by all. I’m an ISFJ and my main desire is to feel needed...to take care of the people I love and be someone for them to turn to. Hope that helps somehow!
30	ISFJ and anxiety	I’m an ISFJ to the core and I get really anxious when conflict arises or when things don’t go the way I planned for them to go. Right now at work, someone sent me an angry email about a project that I was never given a deadline. The project is 80% done. And for some reason I’m still anxious about it and just beating myself up for not getting it done. I’m sure many of you are perfectionists like I am. Do you guys find yourselves getting anxious easily? If so, how do you cope with it? Thanks. 
27	I completely relate. Are you also highly sensitive? I'm very sensitive. Ever since I can remember, I can't stand having someone be upset with me. But I've become more and more accepting that this will happen sometimes in life as I have become an adult. \n\nThings that make me anxious stick with me, I get tense, can't relax, sometimes have trouble falling asleep because of it. I watch some ASMR videos and lay down in a dark room to try to relax and cope with the anxiety, but sometimes not even that helps. I'm considering going on something because the anxiety and rumination is unbearable at times. 
9	Same. Not necessarily with work, but simple things like planning to go to lunch at (enter restaurant name here) and then showing up and there’s a 2-hour wait. I planned for things to go one way, and not I have to start from scratch and come up with a new plan. 
7	Am highly sensitive. Get anxious very easily when I receive any work related messages out of hours
7	I used to be like you, where every criticism or anytime I get bad feedback, I take it to heart. What helped me, as a fellow ISFJ with pretty bad anxiety, is to not let it run my life.\n\nI used to ruminate over these things for a good week before I start to forget about it. But I reflected a bit on myself and I said to myself, "why am i letting small things ruin my happiness?". I then realized that I couldn't continue living this way and wanted to lead a more content life because if I got upset every time this happens, I am no longer looking at the bigger picture.\n\nI think for you, it will take some time and baby steps. It helped me to start thinking "will this person's remark matter tomorrow? In a week? In a month?" then when I say "no" to these questions, I made myself accept that it happened, that because it won't matter in x time period, I shouldn't spend too much time on it.\n\nIn terms of your project, you weren't given a deadline and someone was not happy about it. Start by putting your mindset into "what can I do today to resolve this issue" as opposed to "omg I made a mistake, I should have known better, why didn't I do X, Y, and Z?!" (looking too deep into how you feel).\n\nIn summary, acknowledge that you feel like shit about it, but give yourself a time limit i.e. "I will only allow myself to feel like shit for 2 hours then I'll take action", and then think about your life as a whole. You don't want to be on your death-bed wishing you didn't waste time feeling bad.\n\nHope this gives you some tangible ideas as to how you can handle these situations better. It will get easier to get past your sensitivity, it just takes practice! Good luck!\n\n
4	Meditation can help to reduce anxiety
3	Yes, conflict, etc gives me anxiety..\n\nI'm still learning to cope with it by 'acceptance'. That's all I can say. Breathing deep helps. And I try hard to step back, relax and ask myself "would it help to be feeling this way" ...doesn't always work, but am certainly improving..
2	Agreed. I do have high anxiety generally and it’s very different difficult for me to get over situations where my decisions were questioned or criticized. I panic or worry for days or longer. Medication and prayer have been my only successful tools for getting through it and not stressing out my family and friends. 
2	I feel like talking our feelings out loud with someone who could provide some rational thought (particularly with someone high in Ne who can consider possibilities we haven't seen) really helps.
2	I relate too we can get bad anxiety. Sometimes taking a deep breath helps. Also, meditation is a great way to reduce stress I’ve been doing it for the past month and I’ve felt more at ease and relaxed in my life. 
10	Hey ISFJs, could you take a second to take my MBTI Romantic Relationship Survey?	 [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2QSNJPP](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2QSNJPP)\n\nAny type can take it. If you know your and your current or ex partner's mbti, please fill out as many times as you've had partners!\n\nIt's simple and I would love to expand on it in the future but these are all the variables I need to complete my Multivariate Statistics Analysis class. I'll be posting results near the end of the month.\n\nThank you!
3	Done!
2	Also done!
1	Done! What's it for?\n

8	ENFP girl with ISFJ mom. How do I convince her to go to therapy?	Hello lovely people!\n\nSo my mom is an ISFJ and all her life she’s sacrificed herself for me and my sister. Nonetheless, she’s had a great career, she makes a fantastic doctor, she’s among the best in our country in her niche because of her amazing work ethics.\n\nThe years of my adolescence were very tough (I am 22 now and I’m mostly past my issues, but I was suicidal twice, I went through depression, self harm, EDs, it was a whole mess) and they definitely left a scar in mom.\n\nShe struggles with depression, but she tends to overwork herself and suppress her feelings instead of taking the time to find more healthy coping mechanisms. I think she would greatly benefit from therapy and she even found a therapist she would trust (the one I went to when I was struggling with EDs and my mom became friends).\n\nI would like her to take a bit of time for her mental health now that my sister and I are both adults, but she is very reluctant to the idea, and I think that’s because of fear rather than lack of time or energy.\n\nIs there anything I can say to her to convince her?
2	I just started therapy a couple months ago (1x/week), and it’s been really great for me. The biggest reason I did it is because I saw how some of my issues were affecting my boyfriend and family. Going was largely for them and to make sure I could be a better person, but now I do it for both them and myself because I see how helpful it is if that makes sense. So maybe voice if you feel her depression is affecting you or those around her, and I think her Fe will want to make a change, for the greater good if not for herself. But as niklii said, definitely start with how much you love and appreciate her. 
2	It’s great that you are concerned about your mom. Just tell her that you and the family want what’s best for her and that you love her. Also, mention the effect it’s having on the people around her that will appeal to her Fe. Tell her the benefits therapy could bring her in her life and how it could help her have a better work-life balance. 
1	Just remind her how wonderful she has been to take care of you and your sister. Now it’s your turn to help her take care of herself. If you were depressed, wouldn’t she want you to see a professional too?
7	What are your opinions on children?	Do you want/have children? Or are you rather antinatalistic? Do you have a view on parenting styles/how you would raise children? Do you like taking care of kids? Etc.
11	I don’t hate children but I love my freedom. I also never had the burning desire to be a mother. I’m convinced that I came into this world to wonder and explore with my dog next to me (ok maybe the dog part won’t be forever) and not to create mini me’s who require SO much of myself for so many years. \n
4	I think the greatest thing ill ever do in life is raise children. I don't have any yet, but having a nice family with kids and a husband would make my life feel complete. I raised my three younger siblings so I have a lot of experience and with kids I usually go with complete honesty (with the exception of horrible things kids shouldn't know about yet) because kids are much more intuitive than adults think. We underestimate them. So I'm gonna treat my kids like a close friend who is much less mature and needs looking after
3	I have a desire to give birth to and raise a child.  Possibly just one, not more than two. I had loving parents and want to do an even better job than they did. I want to have that life experience. Raising a child is more important to me than giving birth to one. I am still trying to convince my INTP partner to raise a child with me one day. He did not grow up with unconditional love like I did. \n\nEdit: to answer more of your question, I want to treat my children with respect, treat them more like an equal when they are in their late teens. My dad was overly strict when it came to me dating and having sex (mainly because I am a woman) and I have no desire to be strict like that, rather to be open with my child and teach them how to protect themselves from unsafe sex or an abusive relationship. I want them to be able to feel like they can talk to me about anything without fear of judgment. I’ve thought about this a lot since I’ve been in a relationship with my INTP boyfriend for 10+ years, helping him get on his feet financially and emotionally, and giving him the unconditional love that his mother didn’t give him.
3	Hate em, dont want em. 
3	Babies are cool and amazing to watch grow. \nFrom ages 3-10 children are loud and whine too much. \nFrom ages 10-13 they are kinda smart and ask amazing questions. \nFrom 14-20 they either start becoming jerks or they bloom into kind humans. \n\nAt any rate I can’t handle any of them. Having children was never in the cards for me and being around them I limit myself to max of two hours exposure. I get completely drained listening to all the noise that comes with children - yes even the “beautiful” laughter. \n\nIf i would have had a child (yes just one), I would be just like my father organized, rules would be in place and proper discipline. We were never yelled at or spanked, but we were spoken to and grounded when necessary. Also, hugged and kissed on the forehead a lot to this day actually. I would like to think I would have been just like my father. 
2	I don’t hate children, but I’m not crazy about them either. I like taking care of them, but I don’t want them anytime soon.
2	Hell no I don't want no children! 
2	I am personally a firm antinatalist, though I keep my beliefs to myself for obvious reasons. \n\n\nI am also uncomfortable with children because I don’t know how to be polite to them. I never hang out with children as an adult. I think I could learn how to be fine with children, but I don’t have a real desire to. \n\n\nWhen my friends start having children, I fear I will have to start my social life from scratch. :/ 
2	I want children.\n\nNo, I love children but I think my health is too weak for that.\n\nYes, I have my views, dreams, elaborate ideas on parenting, on relating to kids. I would raise my kids like how the mother in 'Wolf Children' raises her kids - with patience, stability, gentleness, acceptance, understanding, emotional connection. I will give them freedom to explore the world inside and out, while trying to introduce them to different values, and protect them dearly. If I can be their 'home' where they feel warmth or where they can feel they can turn to when they are down, what more would I want from life. I don't mean asking me for advice, my goal perhaps would be to be a person they would hug in silence when they feel the harsh moments of life, and for them to know/realize/feel that the silent love between us is meaningful against the puzzling harshness that life sometimes presents.\n\nAlso, I'd let them explore the meaning of life, of God, of everything under the sun without contaminating their exploration with my own views.. but would be very encouraging of intellectual, spiritual, artistic exploration and strive to provide a conducive environment for such journey.\n\nI love baby-sitting, love taking care, playing with them, just watching them breathe, being around them, and getting lost in their world of wonder and innocence. They sure can be hard work, but I still love them very much..\n\nSo much so, I actually went through a phase where I always got dreams about 'my child', of being pregnant, of delivering baby and such. I still get such dreams sometimes.\n\nIt really scares me how much I want to birth a child and how weak my health is.. It depresses me a lot.
2	I don't like taking care of other kids, I find it hard to predict how they ll react but I really, really want my own kid(s). I am a firm believer that kids are smart as hell and to always treat them like they know more than you think they do. My mom is the absolute best at this, and being treated like I was respected by her when I was little I think has really impacted me positively. 
1	They're quite delic-er-uh I mean, I'd love to have some one day, but rn I'm way too selfish to have any. 
9	Hello fellow ISFJs, how do you indulge in creative arts?	Besides listening to music or watching movies :p\n\n* So, how often do you engage your imaginative side? \n* Do you experience any challenges in creative expression?\n* What creative arts do you engage in?\n* Anything else you want to say about creativity?\n\nAs for me, I've always been bad at creative writing. But can get a little(very little) creative with cooking sometimes. I also sing a lot. And, got into pencil sketching a couple of months ago, absolutely loving it and I really wish to get more creative - have my own ideas rather than look at something and sketch it down... I cannot go beyond a limited level of creativity when I sketch.. there's this block, I want to overcome it. IDK what I am aiming for, but want creativity to burst open rather than show itself so minimally in me.
7	I love project-type stuff, so I’m more into arts and crafts than straight art. I usually run across pictures of something and then look at a million related pictures and then decide I’m going to use books and videos and self-teach. I then immediately launch into intermediate level projects. I skip the scarves and go straight to knitting sweaters.   That kind of thing.\n\nMaking things makes me happy and looking at pictures of stuff people make makes me happy. I’ve done sewing, crochet and knitting. I’m in the middle of learning quilting and almost done with my first quilt. Things I want to do in the future are reupholstery and woodworking. The wonderful thing about crafts over art is that if you have trouble being creative to the extend that you want, crafts allow you to work based off of plans or instruction that you can the customize to make unique, or just invest a lot of time and patience in so it’s done well. \n\nThat being said, I do also enjoy some art. Right now I’m really taken with urban sketching. (Check out instagram for #urbansketching. There is some amazing talent out there. It’s hard to find time with kids, but I try and get some sketching and watercolor in.
5	I'm more an art-appreciator than an artist, myself. I took art history in college so I would have a better understanding of what I was looking at, and I found that made my viewing experience richer.\n\nLike you, I do like to get creative in the kitchen. I also recently moved into a new apartment and I'm enjoying slowly decorating it to my tastes. 
6	My favorite is baking! I greatly enjoy the result of all the time and effort I am investing. The structure of a recipe helps me to focus and keep myself from getting lost in the possibilities. Obviously, practice makes perfect,  the more you do something the better you'll be. 
4	I’m not as imaginative as I would like. I will pick up on a trend or style and experiment with it. I like starting out with the bare necessities of whatever creative tool or medium and do a lot of self discovery. \n\nI turned a hobby into a career and I’m a user experience web specialist. I like to dig into the root cause of an issue or workflow and piece together both visual and functional solutions. \n\nI get really self conscience when I have to copy someone else’s work to either solve something adhoc or to put a fire out with a bandaid or patch approach. I’d lend that to a perfectionist attitude. Getting better at that though. \n\nCan’t for the life of me write. It’s because I’ve built up the way in which I’ve learned things and while in high school could never figure out English studies. No one could explain it to me like I consumed math, science and social. I would like to as it would help me immensely.\n\nWhen working on something I need my focus time which helps recharge my batteries especially when I have my enlightenment moments with what I’m doing that can contribute to a conversation pieces with friends.\n\nThanks for the thoughtful question.  
3	Props to you because I stopped trying to be creative a long time ago. It just isn't for me. However, I am actually really good at creative writing but not much else besides singing and playing viola. These are, of course, things where the song has already been written and I'm not actually creating as much as recreating. So I guess my advice is strive to do what you want to do but some people just aren't that creative and you have to accept what you can't do just as much as what you can do. :) good luck
5	Creativity is incredibly difficult for me. It seems I’m the perfectionist type. I feel like it has something to do with the ISFJ’s duty-oriented side. I’ve never been one for artistic flow vs following directions well. I make attempts but it always comes off very mechanical.
2	I'm alright at it, actually. Probably not NP level of absurdity, but on occasion I've surprised other people and even myself with my ideas.\n\nI love creative writing, particularly online roleplaying :)
2	I draw. Mostly fanart, because I find original ideas to be unfulfilling and dull. I more like how I can watch myself improve, the whole thing is nicely predictable. I prefer sketches with pencil and working towards giving my drawings character over big finished pieces using other mediums.\n \nI also quite like crocheting and knitting. it's a stress reliever and if I have an idea of what to make, I can do it but there's tons of existing patterns out there. 
2	I’ve been a drummer in bands since I was 13 (30 now). Played for church bands as long as I’ve been drumming, so I’ve never really had downtime in between projects. I used to make songs on my computer from early high school til a couple years ago. Currently I’m in a hardcore band and having a blast.
1	I play Dungeons & Dragons. I don't have a lot of time for creative outlets, so every now and then I get a strong craving to create, and D&D fits the bill.
7	When drinking alcohol	When drinking alcohol, or indulging in whatever stimulating substance of your choosing, do you always know how much you are taking in? Meaning are you always aware of the amounts prior to ingesting?\n\nExample, would you be the kind to ingest alcohol on the rocks, knowing in advance the desired effects? Or, would you ingest a random amount, later to realize you took too much of a gulp?
6	I just drink it and I can tell how much alcohol is in whatever it is by the taste, and by the tiny buzz I get after the first couple of sips. I stop based on when I feel like if I drink more I will drink too much. I think this is pretty typical. 
4	I usually drink beer. The alcohol is already portioned out for me. 
2	Yes. I count. My limit is around 7 or 8 in a few hours. Never more than 2 before driving, with food. 
2	I drink more amount of alcohol when I am at home or with family, than when I go out, where I drink in limits. Both times I am always definitely aware of what and how much alcohol I take..\n\nAnd yes, like the other user mentioned, I can tell the amount of alcohol I take and could further take by the feeling I get.. 
1	I know my limits, and I really don't like to drink too much, because I usually feel scared when I become drunk, haha. So when I feel 'the tinginling sensation' in my fingers ;), I stop drinking.
1	I drink beer every once in a while. If I’m at a social event or something I will have a drink or two. Sometimes I will get drunk and but I’m usually aware of my limits.

5	INTJ in need of help with ISFJ friend/co-worker.	Preface this with this.  I'm an INTJ, therefore I analyze and analyze and analyze everything.  BUT, I'm also a complete moron when it comes to reading and understanding someone's emotions and social queues.  Therefore, I get frustrated analyzing these things because I don't get it.  So yeah, there's that.\n\nAnyway.  At work, there is a lady, mid 20s, single mom.  I'm in my mid 30s, married dad.  I'm an INTJ, she's an ISFJ (I remember because we did one of those company exercises where we took the test).  Over the years, we've developed kind of a "frenemy" relationship.  Friends but playfully antagonistic with each other.  We talk mad shit and hate on each other all the time, but it's all in good fun.  Years without any hurt feelings that I can tell.  At company outings we usually end up hanging out, etc.  There has never been anything romantic or sexual between us.\n\nOut of the blue this week she has all but completely stopped talking to me or acknowledging me.  If I say 'hi' or 'what's up?' in passing I get a flat 'hi' and she keeps walking.  I popped over to her cube with a quick, "Hey are you doing OK?"  She says she's fine.  "You sure?  You see a little off."  Yep, she's fine.\n\nI'm afraid that I've unintentionally done something to upset her.  It's a friendship that I value and I want to make it right.\n\nHow do I approach this?  Do I just give her space and not engage?  Do I give it the old, "Hey, I think I might have made you mad and I want to say I'm sorry?"  I don't know.\n\nSince this is at work, I'm a little worried about getting an HR beef.  But it's my friend, and I want to fix whatever is broken.
16	As an ISFJ, I often prefer to be non-confrontational. To a fault actually. So maybe that’s what’s happening with your coworker. If something did come up between you two and it upset her, if she’s anything like me, it might probably be that she feels that she wants you to address it first. Not specifically because the blame is on you or that she wants you to fix it because it’s “your fault”, but just because speaking up about it just doesn’t feel right and might cause turbulence. Like she might come off as too aggressive or rude if she calls you out and that you’ll be off-put by that. \n\nGoing and saying “Hey, just wanted to clear the air, is there something I did or said that put you off?” can be a start to discovering why that hard behavior started in the first place. It also would be extremely valuable to say that you feel that the friendship is important to you and that you feel it’s worth your time to maintain/mend it. ISFJ’s need a lot of positive feedback and we can’t put ourselves in the vulnerable place enough to express that we need it. 
8	ISFJ married to an INTJ here. Do you recall your last few conversations before she stopped talking to you, and what were they about? \n\nDoes she have a decent understanding oof INTJs? If not, you may have said something that you did not intentionally mean to hurt her and she took it at face value.\n\nRegardless, I recommend talking to her or writing her a note or something that just says, "Hey, I think I have done something to hurt your feelings and if so, I am really sorry about that. I miss chatting/hanging out with you. Let me know what I can do for you."
3	Just a thought, maybe there is something going on in her personal life and/or she isn't feeling social. I'm an ISFJ and sometimes even after a day where I talk a "lot" with a co-worker and feel like I bonded with them, the next day I'm not up for socializing for whatever reason and I barely talk to them at all. It's nothing personal on my end. \n\nDon't know if this is what's going on and I know sometimes people won't tell you the truth when directly asked, but if she says nothing is wrong (and you truly have no idea of anything you might have done to bother her) maybe just take her word for it. \n\nGood luck :)
2	Great advice from everyone. Turns out just a bad week, not something I did and my issues reading emotions biting me. 
1	INTP engaged to an ISFJ. Sounds like you upset her accidentally. Just apologize to her and make it a general apology. It should fix things up and they will see your intent.
1	Yeah I think there are two potential possibilities\n1. You did something to unintentionally upset her and she doesn’t know how to talk to you about it  (because ISFJs don’t usually feel comfortable with situations that can lead to conflict). Which in this case you should say something along the line of  “I want you to know that I value our friendship highly and if you are upset about something please come out and tell me”. Also don’t be super pushy and agressive about it, that can make us want to withdraw from you even more. \n\n2. She is just overwhelmed having a lot of issues in her personal life and she is just having a bad day. 
2	Music and personality data gathering (5 minute survey)	Hello all, if you are interested, I created a survey regarding Mbti type and music preferences.

It'll only take a few minutes, so please check it out.\n\nI will be posting results after all the data has been compiled.\nhttps://goo.gl/forms/wgMY0z9LvWmN0NY23\n\n***Edit: I will be closing the test to do data stuff at 2pm CT on Sunday, August 5. Sorry if you didn't get it a chance to take the test. Look for the results post in a day or two.***
1	Haha no one helped you
31	Do you ever feel ignored when you are in a group setting with friends?	Do you ever feel like you don't belong in your group of friends because you would rather listen than share details about your life? \n\nAs a long time introvert, i kinda find it difficult to speak because the moment i want to voice out something, it drowns very quickly because your other friends are busy talking about something  ( for instance, they have same interest and well, you are out of their line) . Although they dont do that intentionally, i feel as if they are excluding me just because i dont share the same interests with them. Im not saying they are that way but im getting the feeling. It is as if im just the listener. they are more into makeup and k drama while im here , always a plain jane ( no makeup). \n\nDue to that, it is not surprising that whenever im with them one on one, the conversation is somewhat shallow like " so how are you?", "the weather feels like___" or we wont say much to one another until it's time to say goodbye. \n\nDon't get me wrong, i also make an effort whenever they would invite me to their parties or events but still, I think Im born to be a listener ( and give an advice). Im comfortable being this way .Yes, you could say i wanna please them but i just cant help feeling excluded \n\nAny stories out there?\n\n\n\n
13	I can relate with this so much. When it’s a large group of people I do fine when smaller groups split off and I can talk with 1 or 2 people but when it’s 12 and we’re all talking about something, my voice gets drowned out really easily even if I am really interested in the topic. I’ve also been told the pitch of my voice is tough to pick out of a crowd to, which doesn’t help with feeling ignored all the time. \n\nSometimes I’m actually glad I’m easily ignored or forgotten in a crowd. I don’t always want to talk or share my ideas just yet. Other times though, it really kills my drive to invest in my friends.\n\nIt’s concerning to me that you say that even one on one your conversations with friends are superficial. That would be normal if you’ve only been friends a month or two. If you’ve been friends for a lot longer then you might need to find friends you connect with better. 
8	How common is it for ISFJ to sufferer from abandonment issues? Do any of you guy's have this problem?	Is it normal for ISFJ to suffer from abandonment issues? Personally my mother passed away when I was 7 years,  stepdad, Stepsister, and Stepbrother moved away after my mom died.  I never had the chance to say goodbye in a proper way to my mother and stepslibings. I wish I can make peace with them,  but It's impossible.  How do you guy's deal with this issue if you suffer from abandonment issues.  Sorry for the grammar mistakes. 
3	Im really sorry for your lost . Im in lost for words that your stepdad and step siblings decided to just leave right away. They could have taken you also but no.\n\nI havent suffered from abandonment issues yet. If i were to experience that, it would feel as if you are just an option to your close ones or anybody. They dont take you seriously indeed.\n\nIt's hard to be in your shoes and i wish i could give the best advice . \n\nKeep praying to almighty lord and everything will be fine. He listens to our prayers. Do the things you love and meet new people. You might as well connect with your cousins on your mom's side for closure and ask them for help. \n\nAlso, do not base your worth on someone's approval or opinion of you. If they just see you as an option or a convenient friend, then they aint worth your time and you are better than  that honey. It's their problem they dont take you seriously enough. I would rather be alone than to remain friends with "these" people.\n\nI know this is not an isfj ( Im an isfj) thing but I learned a lot from my past. I realized that these people are not the only ones occupyinv the planet earth. There are so much worthy people to meet.\n\nHope you're having the best time of your life right now\n\nMy piece of advice\n\n🤗
2	Sorry about your family.. I hope that one day soon you can make peace with it.. \n\nI  have issues too but maybe like most of us generally do.. My parents are with me, but there were those rare moments when they fight, I had hysterical outbursts and they calm down for my sake. \n\nAnd in general, I do fear separation.. IDK how to deal with it, other than preparing myself for acceptance or a stoic resignation to fate. 
2	I lost my mom too 10 yrs ago. Didn't get a chance to say my farewells too. The pain never really goes away... it just gets better in time. But the pain will always be there. I hope you find it in yourself to not let yourself suffer for too long. Pain is inevitable...suffering is another story. 
2	I'm sorry about that :( I definitely have separation and social anxiety which interferes in all my relationships, but I am thankful that my family and closest friends still are around to support me.\n\nI'd say you don't suffer from abandonment "issues". You suffer from abandonment, period. I hope you do find support for yourself. Have you considered therapy?
1	(Cross-post) Temperament and Humor (All over 14 Welcome)	 Hello! I recently posted a survey you might find interesting. It would really help me out if you would participate!\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/92ynz1/academic\_temperament\_and\_humor\_all\_over\_14\_welcome/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/92ynz1/academic_temperament_and_humor_all_over_14_welcome/)
9	Burnout?	I don't know if you guys can relate to this or how you got out of this 'funk'.\n\nLately, I've just avoiding people like crazy, particularly strangers. My family and absolute closest friends I'm mostly okay with, however.\n\nMy mother hosted a party last night with people from her work, and I had absolutely no desire to socialize.\n\nI was acting like my brother, who I believe is an ISTJ: hiding indoors and just doing my thing. I had to eventually force myself outside and barely listen to others so as to not embarrass my mother and appear "rude".\n\nA sorta friend-sorta acquaintance but much older woman called asking for me, and I told my mother to tell her I was in the bathroom and would call back (lol).\n\nI'm internally groaning at the thought of work tomorrow. I thought it was cuz maybe I'm starting to hate my job, but it's not that. My job is interesting. But putting up with the people, and having to interact, constantly watch what I'm saying, put up with whatever it is they throw at me and act as polite as possible, is just... \*ugh\*.\n\nFunny enough, at yesterday's party, at one point one woman started discussing literature she enjoyed, and immediately my energy perked up. Maybe it's cuz I finally felt like I could contribute and have a discussion with her, rather than simply ask her questions about herself and be attentive to her needs.\n\nEdit as of 8/6: Just letting you know, the funk improved. Happens occasionally. Just take a break from people for a while, and you'll be back to normal lol
6	People are draining. Its being around so many people but not connecting with any of them. Its hard acting around people you dont know
4	Yes,  it's the needless small talk that I dread sometimes too.  Mostly because I know if I tried to steer it a bit to something I would want to talk about, I wouldn't get that same energy/effort. Mainly because as you said they're aquaintances. You picture the boring conversations ahead of time and wish it could be different. \n\nAs for getting through it, this "funk", I really don't know myself. Hope you can find it 🙂
1	I personally don’t need the daily interaction with coworkers or even friends everyday. I’m an introvert and while I enjoy spending time with my friends, there are days where I am in deep thoughtful planning phase and I enjoy my time alone. That constant planning, just happens in my head as I run through different scenarios of what my life could potentially be. Those days are draining and so I enjoy those days/weeks just by myself and my dog. I think wanting to be alone for days/weeks is totally normal.
2	Struggling ISFJ seeking advice: Does anyone work in the Insurance industry?	Hi everyone,\n\nI’m an ISFJ struggling to find a career path and have recently been introduced to a career path in the insurance industry, and was wonder if anyone had any experience working in the industry?\n\nIf so, what do you do?  What do you like and not like about it? Does it have decent career potential?
2	I do! I work as a commercial underwriter (assistant for the time being while growing my own book) at an E&S MGA. It isn't what I ever saw myself doing, but I've been with my company for 3 years. The portion I actually struggle with the most is the marketing while I try to build my own agency relationships, but I love the fact that there is always something new to learn. No two insureds/policies are the same. I'm offered the opportunity for continual growth in this career, which I did not have in my previous career as a Vet Tech. \nDo you have any specific questions about the job? 
2	I work in the IT and Marketing department of an insurance services company. I’ve met a lot of people that have long careers in the industry. 
2	I worked in the actuarial department for an insurance company. Loved my boss and my job was alright, but I decided to switch careers to do research at a university. 
1	Don’t work at mapfre. That’s all. 
4	Tell me some traits of yours that is not typical for ISFJ.	
16	ISFJs are supposedly great with interior design and organization. I’m flipping terrible at both
11	I’m really competitive. Is that normal for an ISFJ? Haha
5	The description of ISFJ say we like tradition. I think that treat doesn’t necessarily apply to me. I like to think of myself as a flexible person who adapts quickly to change and is open minded.
3	My memory is extremely bad :/ 
4	I actually don’t mind breaking rules that I think are stupid and don’t make sense to me. I also have a traveled out of America twice in my life and I’m 21.
3	So apparently one of the main traits of an ISFJ is that we are super organized. I am 100% ISFJ, WITHOUT the organization lol. I'm 25 and have always been nicknamed "scatterbrain". My desks and lockers in school were constantly unorganized, my room always looks like a cyclone just went through it. Even as a baby/toddler, my mom would know which rooms I'd been in because there would be a little pile of toys wherever I had been sitting 😂. It doesn't matter how tidy I try to keep things, my surroundings always end up in disarray within days. \n\nThat being said, I actually LOVE when things are in order and my anxiety skyrockets when my surroundings look like this lol.. but no matter how hard I try, I can't keep things tidy! Still holding onto the hope that it'll change someday but we will see haha.
2	I can be extremely volatile when I’m pushed past my limits/temper. I suppose that’s the other side of the seesaw of being genuinely caring. 
2	I don’t stay long with jobs I don’t feel passionately about and I don’t enjoy. I also leave relationship when I start to feel unfulfilled and unhappy and when I am betrayed. I’m not a doormat as they usually stereotype ISFJs.\n\n
1	Extremely ambitious/driven
1	can read or determine manipulation, stops caring when people abuses me or takes advantage of me, great at designing model for research ( yep i just got my bachelor degree in economics), perfectionist? can be at times
2	ISFJ vs ISFJ; Is it even possible?	Me and my sort of girlfriend are dating several times. Yes we are long distance but I would like to focus on the time we ware together. \n\nI will give a brief overview of things that I found noteworthy.   \n\- The first walks with here dog ware together, but after some days she didn't like my company and wanted to walk alone. Fine, no problem there.  \n\- I brought some small food gifts. She looked at it, tried it short and never touched it again. (In my company.) Something to do with different love languages... In addition, I hid a book in here house to find it later, she was overwhelmed and it was the best gift ever.   \n\- I personally don't like last minute changes. Although I know she has time in the proposed weekend, she hasn't agreed on it yet and it worried about it not being definitive. \n\n\- Most important point: Although I am the one typing the most in chats, she was the one talking throughout our dates. I was completely shut down, couldn't think of questions. Although we liked our company, we ware super silent after a while. I keep thinking about this, is this normal? Or has that something to do with insecurities and not profiles?\n\nApart from my experiences I wrote, I haven't seen many matching personalities. Can it actually work in theory?\n\nDo you think it is even possible to give our selves a feature or am I trying way to hard to let this happen? Every thought is welcome!
3	Your English is cute lol.\n\nI think you should give it time :) ..it could work out, you as an ISFJ would know, we are slow moving creatures aren't we? Be yourself, give it time, see where it goes.. hope it works out :)
3	Yeah I posted a reddit last week about two ISFJs in relationship you can check it out. I think that it can work but since you guys have the same strengths and weaknesses you might not grow much in the relationship. I would give it a try though you shouldn’t eliminate her just because she’s an ISFJ like you. 
9	How do you guy's deal with anxiety about the future? How do you guy's let things be?	It's pretty simple.  How do you guy's let thing's be and not constantly worry about your future? 
9	My ISFJ girlfriend often has this issue since she runs her own business as a graphic designer. I'm ENFP so almost the exact opposite. \n\nI find what helps her most is to sit down and start mapping out a path to some goals whether it is financial, fitness, social etc. Just having a clear blueprint on some achievements and getting her to take small steps along that is enough to put her at ease. 
8	I wallow in anxiety for a bit, step back breathe consciously and then I try to divert myself by trying to realize what will be will be, ways of universe being beyond our control or understanding blah blah blah (all sorts of life philosophy quotes/concepts that I believe in, actually) and divert my attention to music or sketching or studies..\n\nI am learning to 'give up'/accept with a stoic resignation after a point. Because no point in my anxiety, I can cry/smile/be nonchalant - what will happen will happen... Sometimes it's not easy, obviously, but I guess trying to come out of anxiety in itself provides some relief..\n\nTo tell you what works for me - music, breathing long and deep, sketching, going out for walks, watching nature, watching everything around me by 'switching off' my mind dissociating myself and bearing the view as a cinema screen helps me (in most cases)\n\nEDIT - I also talk to my parents sometimes. Or just stay around them, follow them around like a puppy.. 
5	I accept the thing things I can control, try to be prepared for the future by using the past, and know that not everything can be controlled. Let go and let it be. If it is meant to be, then so it will be.
3	In trying to let things be you are not letting things be. It's a call for lack of action, not a need for action. It's recognizing there's nothing you need to do.\n\nThis contradicts a lot of what we think, that there is something we must do or could have done. You don't even have to try in letting things go because in doing so you are merely creating subtle tension, once again that there's something we must do. There's really nothing to do. This current anxiety about the future is fine in that you don't have to make it go away. What you're doing right now--seeking out help, asking for advice--is your manner of coming to terms how to deal with the anxiety, or more accurately it's the anxiety resolving itself. \n\nStill, if you insist on coming up with a method of sorts then the best I can suggest is re-defining your relationship with the anxiety. Why is it bad? It may help to view your anxiety as an annoying family member. You obviously can't get rid of them but they are obviously still annoying you. So you gotta learn how to live with it in a productive manner. Before you know it, the annoying family member has matured and is no longer annoying. In fact they may be rather pleasing to hang around with :) Just gotta treat them with patience, understanding, and a bit of love. Accept the anxiety rather than pushing it away; it's there for a reason.
3	I agree with the rest of these responses!\n\nI find that music helps a lot. Genuinely taking life one day at a time forces you to live in the moment, preventing you from becoming too caught up with what could happen. Make sure that you have  things to look forward to! Reward yourself for a hard-days work. \n\nIt’s all about the details.
2	I try to tell myself that everything is going to workout. If I can I try to plan ahead for potential mishaps or problems. I also try to know things that could happen in the future so I can mentally prepare myself. 
2	By embracing the awareness of what I can control and what I can't.  Looking back, I've realized that as long as I just use common sense and trust my gut, plan the way I want to plan, control the stuff I have control of, things have mostly worked out okay for me.  Sure, there has been some stuff that didn't happen the way I'd hoped, but again... focusing only on what I can control means I typically have a Plan B or at least some preparation for things not going my way.

7	Dating an ISFJ and I need help	We've been together for 3 years, still going well. The issue that I have is communication - I need to do a huge efforts in order to get him to communicate, that's how I feel like at least and it's making me exhausted because I am introverted as well (I'm an INFJ) I feel like there's times, especially when i start rambling about concepts and different perspectives about things like, love, life, the future, he zones out, or stops talking or completely ignores what I said. Of course I don't mind that necessarily, because I heard pretty often that ISFJs do that, and I learned to accept it and not push it, especially when I can tell they don't feel comfortable. My problem is that sometimes when I feel talkative I cannot shut my mouth, and without wanting it I start rambling again. I always just have feelings about things and I'm pretty open about it, if I get a certain 'vibe' from a certain something I tend to talk about that a lot, I can always tell that he just wants me to shut it, and I do, but then I feel frustrated. \n\nThe only problems that we've ever had in our relationship, is a period of time where we were just toxic to one another & the communication problem. We've been very stable for about 5 to 6 months now, with little to no conflict. What happened before was that we manipulated each other a lot, I was being very pushy to bring our relationship to the next level and I was trying to change his mind by manipulating him, while he wanted to move slowly, and he was constantly throwing blame on me and guilt trip me, he held resentments for some time as well. A year ago our relationship kept being one sided, for me for a period of time, then for him, and so on until we fixed our issues, and now we're stable.\n\nExcepting the 'flashbacks' that we sometimes get about that toxic period of time, the only problem that we have is communication, and It's really hard because we're also into a long distance relationship. A thing I learned about those toxic times is that he has a hard time expressing his feelings, it feels like he just gathers everything and then explodes, and me, on the other hand, as I got very comfortable with him I share almost everything in a instant, which overwhelms him.\n\n\nThe only issue we have now is the communication (and we had it before too but It was overshadowed by the other huge problems we used to have) Our relationship has been a blessing ever since we fixed our issues and we set our boundaries and we're very much in love with each other. I cannot appreciate him more for wanting to work on this rather than break it off. The few questions I have are:\n\n1. How can I make him feel more comfortable when I want to talk? What do you guys like to talk about and what kind of mood do you need to have to feel more safe?\n\n\n2. Sometimes I feel like other people take advantage of his kind soul and I'm too scared to tell him, I used to tell him that in the past when I felt it but he'd just retreat into himself and refuse to talk about the subject. I don't want to push him and make him uncomfortable. I  feel like he sees me as controlling at times, but I really am not I'm just trying to warn him. He once scolded me for focusing too much  on the 'bad side' of people and ignore the good one. He is very altruistic and likes to think that all humans are good by nature, and he gets hurt because of that. He will really say 'there's nothing to worry about x' until the very moment he's being proved wrong. How can I tell him or warn him about certain things without making him uncomfortable?\n\n3. What should I do when I feel frustrated or burnt out? I don't know if I should give him time or insist or just focus on another thing, I just don't want to make him uncomfortable. \n\n4. How can I help him relax when he's stressed out? \n\n\nI'm literally crying as I'm writing this because I love him so much and the last few months have been so amazing and I've never felt so safe & secure & emotionally/mentally stable with a person in my whole life. He brings me down to earth when i tend to be with my head in the clouds and that's one of the best things about him.  I have the need and the will to protect him too and to make him feel safe and comfortable but I just really don't know how to initiate this. I've been thinking for weeks and I feel like the wrong step could make him view me as a burden and I really don't want to ruin this stability.\n\nHe's not my main focus in life, but he's certainly a big one because I'm very family oriented and I'm never dating anyone just for the fun of it. It's always been serious. I am really passionate when it comes to him because I'm legit fascinated by his way of being,so kind and so positive.
12	I don’t think I can answer *all* of your questions, but one thing that springs to mind about the communication is: are you talking *to* him, or talking *at* him? \n\nI know that personally, if someone is just rambling at length about something I don’t really care about, I tend to sort of zone out and just tolerate it, throwing in the occasional “yeah?” or “mhm” so I don’t upset them. But if someone is just going on and on about a subject I have no interest in, it’s definitely annoying. It puts pressure on me and it makes me feel like they care more about using me as a receptacle for their chatter than like they want to engage with me as a person and an equal. \n\nTalking *to* me involves asking questions, giving me the opportunity to truly respond, and, if we’re interested in talking about two totally different things, at least sharing the spotlight of the conversation back and forth so that we can both express ourselves comfortably. If someone wants to talk *to* me I’m almost always happy to engage unless I’m really exhausted, but someone talking *at* me quickly drains my emotional resources and becomes a source of frustration and resentment. It’s all about reciprocity for me. 
5	I would like to know just one thing - are you in a long distance the entire period of your relationship?\n\nIf yes, then I think I understand why it is causing you both the problem. I am not verbal, and thus, cannot really pursue friendship or relationship through emails or texting. However, I do communicate well - when in person - because non-verbal communication, my face, my body language, my voice etc comes to my rescue where words fail.\n\nIDK if it's with all ISFJs, but I personally speak even less when emotional or overwhelmed, cannot really bring myself to speak, and when forced to express myself in such moments, it is short, and certainly, it looks like I'm disinterested if it's through a text message. Which is sometimes the same in person, but I can express myself and somehow people close to me understand me, in person.. (not at all times)\n\nSo, before answering your other questions, I'd like to know if he's the same in person too.
3	To answer your last question.. not sure if this is true for other isfjs, but I wouldn’t mind being directly asked: “Is there anything I can do for you right now?” This wouldn’t work over the phone as much, but if my INTP partner asked me that (which he rarely does) I would be able to tell him I need a cuddle or a cup of tea or just to talk about something that’s on my mind. Usually I ask my partner this question to no avail but that’s because he doesn’t know what he needs. I guess it depends how in tune you are with yourself too. We tend to treat our partners in ways we would want to be treated, so pay attention to what your partner does for you when you are stressed out yourself, and try to reciprocate that back! I need to work on this myself with my sweet anxious INTP boyfriend.
2	>I feel like there's times, especially when i start rambling about concepts and different perspectives about things like, love, life, the future, he zones out, or stops talking or completely ignores what I said.\n\nINFJs have a habit of getting a bit abstract or paint a very broad picture when they speak. I'm betting he's getting caught up on a single detail, giving it more thought, and then "phasing out" why he thinks about that one specific detail. Then, once he's given it sufficient thought you have already moved on and he's lost.\n\n>My problem is that sometimes when I feel talkative I cannot shut my mouth, and without wanting it I start rambling again. I always just have feelings about things and I'm pretty open about it, if I get a certain 'vibe' from a certain something I tend to talk about that a lot, I can always tell that he just wants me to shut it, and I do, but then I feel frustrated.\n\nhmm, have you tried engaging him? Pause from time to time and ask him what he thinks. He's may be uncertain whether you want him to speak or just listen. Alternatively, he may be uninterested in the topic, but will opt to listen anyway because he loves you and knows the topic is something you enjoy.\n\n>The only problems that we've ever had in our relationship, is a period of time where we were just toxic to one another & the communication problem.\n\nmhm, I could see this being a problem. At times I feel like I'm talking to a Vulcan when talking to INFJs. Both types are just so cautious with their feelings and that makes it challenging to have uncomfortable conversations. ISFJs have the bad habit of dropping hints about their feelings in a passive aggressive fashion, yet fail to verbally express those feelings.\n\n>A thing I learned about those toxic times is that he has a hard time expressing his feelings, it feels like he just gathers everything and then explodes, and me, on the other hand, as I got very comfortable with him I share almost everything in a instant, which overwhelms him.\n\nYou've found the ISFJ Achilles heel. We dismiss little things as "unimportant", thinking we can take (because we can). This is true for all aspects of life, not just romantically. We don't want to bring it up because it disturbs the peace, "bothers" our loved ones, and is all around unpleasant. This continues to build until they detonate like a nuclear warhead and let it out. A lot of times there are little warning signs that you can see in advance. For example, I will almost loose my temper over something minor and then quickly recover before actually going off. It can be solved by someone asking "Is something on your mind? Anything bothering you?" The answer is usually "Nah, I'm good" or something dismissive along those lines. A followup "Are you sure? There's nothing on your mind right now?". Then the ISFJ, if in the mood to talk, will usually go "Well...<begin epic saga here>". ISFJs typically ignore the first offer to listen out of habit. We brush off help because "we can take it", but asking a second time makes us think and reconsider. Silly, I know, but this is perhaps one our biggest weaknesses.\n\n>How can I make him feel more comfortable when I want to talk? What do you guys like to talk about and what kind of mood do you need to have to feel more safe?\n\nIt really depends on the subject. Though funny as this may sound, at least for me, an ISFJ's mood is heavy affected by the people I am spending time with. I can "sense" the emotional state of the other and either feel peace or extremely anxious. If I can't sense their emotional state, then I feel extremely anxious and uneasy. The biggest indicator that I personally use is body language, primarily facial expressions. From observation INFJs have the ability to seem emotionless, devoid of feeling, cold and detached. In such situations I'll do anything I can to figure out their emotional state. Failing that, I'll try to evoke some form of emotional response to confirm they haven't been replaced by a robot. To answer the second half or your question the topic is going to heavily vary from individual to individual. ISFJs enjoy conversation the most when they know the other party is also enjoying the conversation. In the case of INFJ/ISFJ there is a huge potential for very indepth and analytical conversations on shared interests and such. So I guess the key is enjoy yourself, he will pick up on that, and enjoy himself as well.\n\n>Sometimes I feel like other people take advantage of his kind soul and I'm too scared to tell him, I used to tell him that in the past when I felt it but he'd just retreat into himself and refuse to talk about the subject. I don't want to push him and make him uncomfortable. I feel like he sees me as controlling at times, but I really am not I'm just trying to warn him. He once scolded me for focusing too much on the 'bad side' of people and ignore the good one. He is very altruistic and likes to think that all humans are good by nature, and he gets hurt because of that. He will really say 'there's nothing to worry about x' until the very moment he's being proved wrong. How can I tell him or warn him about certain things without making him uncomfortable?\n\nISFJs help others because we get a great deal of enjoyment out of it. We place ourselves in the other person's position, look at it from their point of view, and make our decision from there. It is who we are, we love to help others when they need it. We are very well aware of the fact that others will use us to their own advantage. Yet, we live by example, hoping that through helping others they will see the value in it. A lot of ISFJs are idealists, we care little for the world as it is now, "we are going to make it better damnit!" is the attitude we have. If we help someone and they are ungrateful, then we will often grow resentful of that person, and will file away their actions away for the future. We ISFJs rely on our past to guide our future and we can be so very stubborn. You can warn him by saying "I think it is possible that so-and-so may be taking advantage of you because <reason>". That at the very least gets him thinking about the potential, making him a bit more wary. By calling it a "potential" you aren't telling him "this is how things are", making him come to this conclusion on his own.\n\n>What should I do when I feel frustrated or burnt out? I don't know if I should give him time or insist or just focus on another thing, I just don't want to make him uncomfortable.\n\nYou could tell him that you are frustrated or burnt out. As an ISFJ he's probably going to ask you if there's anything he can do to help you. If you are up for his assistance, then accept it and enjoy it. Otherwise just express appreciation for his offer, decline, and tell him that you are burned out and need a break from people in general for a bit. He's an introvert too and should reasonably understand the occasional desire for isolation.\n\n>How can I help him relax when he's stressed out?\n\nAsk him what is on his mind in a calm and gentle manner. The first response will probably be "Nothing", but if you gently push with something like "Are you sure? We can talk if you'd like?" should work. This is heavily dependent upon each person though, so it may take a bit to figure out what works.\n\n>I have the need and the will to protect him too and to make him feel safe and comfortable but I just really don't know how to initiate this. I've been thinking for weeks and I feel like the wrong step could make him view me as a burden and I really don't want to ruin this stability.\n\nJust accept him for who he is, tell him that you love and appreciate him and why you do. For most ISFJs there is no burden we will not carry for those we love. And what we crave the most is to feel loved and appreciated by our loved ones. Everything I've said here is my own personal experience. I am just one person and the ISFJ you have likely will be a bit different. Though I do hope this helps you.
1	some isfjs can detect manipulation athough it is not usually an isfj thing. Me as isfj , i hate manipulation and pushy people . Yes , i can detect manipulation haha\n\nhere are my points\n\n1.Dont talk about about abstract concepts if it's not that necessary. I as an isfj , can be curious but not all the time. Yes we can sustain concepts bout future for a day but not too longYes we are focused on the present so we like to talk about things such as : tv shows and characters , daily happenings in our life and cooking (haha)\n\nMoreover, we are not interested in the topics that are of no use in the present ( although we see how it will affect other things in the future)\n\n2. It's simple . Dont be pushy and controlling. You might scare somebody ( just kidding)\n\nWe isfjs dont like conflict and yes we do see good in people although they might prove us wrong. We just dont want to prolong the conflict. We are all about harmony. \n\nThere are times when i can already see the negative side of this person for example and yet i just ignore it or we will avoid that person. We might talk or greet one another but i keep it distant and short.\n\n3. Then cool off. Find something relaxing and later, talk to him about important matters.\n\n4. by reassuring him and giving your so some food?\n\n\nThat's all 
12	Stereotypes of ISFJ and other bullshit. Does that shit annoy you guys?	Excuse my language,  but the stereotypes of the ISFJ is bullshit.  For example : Doormat,Traditionalist, clingy, serve others, etc... \nI honestly can't stand that. I can only speak for myself.  I'm pretty nice to stranger's and people I care for majority of the time .  But if you start getting on my nerves or disrespectful I will shut your ass down.  Second, I'm not a fan of traditions.  I see no point in it.  Personally,  I'm an atheist , so traditions never done anything for me! Third, being clingy for me is a huge no. I love being around people I care for, but not 24/7. I have my own hobbies. An another pet peeve of my mines is ISFJ are forgiving.  I rarely forgive people.  If you betray my trust or hurt me really bad I will doorslam you forever.  I do believe I am an ISFJ, but I'm an ISFJ who can't stand bullshit and get easily annoy from dumb shit.  Sorry for the grammar guys. What do you guys think about the ISFJ stereotypes? Do you considered yourself the typical ISFJ or something else entirely different from the stereotypes. 
13	I mean, I think there’s some truth to most of them, but not in the ways that people think. \n\nThe traditionalist one especially bugs me. I *do* have a really special place in my heart for some traditions, but ones that are personally meaningful even when they go against actual “traditional” values. I don’t believe in gender roles, religion, heteronormativity, I’m extremely hesitant to accept most forms of authority, etc etc. I believe in evaluating what works and what doesn’t and finding better solutions no matter how much things have to change. So, I like things that are comforting and familiar and make me feel close to people I love, and in that sense I do like tradition, but in no way am I “a traditionalist.” \n\nThe doormat/“forgiving” thing is also wrong and annoying. I also don’t believe the “doorslam” is exclusively an INFJ thing the way some people talk about it, I absolutely do that too. If I’m done with you/break up with you in some way, romantically or as friends/family, I am absolutely done forever. There will be no second chances, and I may eventually forgive you, but I won’t ever contact you again, because I deserve to respect my own boundaries. I may let people cross them for a time depending on the situation and what benefit I think I’ll get from allowing the transgressions, but it’s generally a calculated risk, not me just having no spine. \n\nAlso, the idea that we’re stupid (because Ni is the only “smart” function, right?? That’s how that works). My Si is a big part of the reason why I *am* intelligent, and the idea that it’s a useless function that keeps you stuck in the past or only concerned with familiar physical sensations is really aggravating to me. \n\nI dunno, I just hate that the perception of ISFJs seems to be like, your 50 year old bigoted housewife aunt. We make up a big portion of the population and we have a wide variety of interests, beliefs, and perspectives! 
9	i hate that a lot of people seem to type their moms as ISFJ's... they always seem to be so sure that their mother is ISFJ and as a result say they can't get along with other ISFJ's if they don't like their mom
7	I've always wondered if the people who came up with these stereotypes have ever really met an ISFJ, or if it's something they've just theorized and haven't really observed in reality.\n\nThese two especially make me scratch my head sometimes.\n\nTraditional - Most of the ISFJs I know are usually down to try new things. My ISFJ husband is usually the one pulling me out of the house to try new experiences funnily enough.\n\nBoring - Out of all types, I find ISFJs the most mysterious and difficult to read. Especially the intelligent ones. Maybe it's because of my inferior Si, or maybe it's because they mask incredibly well with Fe.\n\nNo matter how much I talk to them or how long I've known them, I can't predict them. I can pretty much get a read on everyone else, so this makes ISFJs incredibly interesting to me imo.
4	I think stereotype is just that... stereotype. \n\nI'm also not traditional in the traditional meaning of the word.. (for example, I refuse to follow any religion but I do believe in God) ...infact, I am unconventional in many ways, but kinda traditional in my own way... IDK how to explain lol\n\nAfter all these years, I have come to a conclusion that the stereotypical descriptions aren't meant to be taken literally, but the stereotype expresses the psyche of the person rather than the trait they possess.\n\nThe whole "bakes cookies" thing... obviously, not all of us do, but it expresses the kind of care or our way of caring for others = giving warmth, comfort (in tangible ways too, we like to show our care in practical way, not just emotional).\n\nThat said, I am forgiving.. very forgiving, I have also been called doormat, but in my eyes I am no doormat and have strong boundaries and individuality - just not in the conventional way of this era.. But it does come off in an ISFJ-ish.. on the outside.\n\nI can stand bullshit.. I have high tolerance level but do not engage in anything bullshitty.. so it looks like I am engaging them but I can tell when something is bullshit, it's just that I cannot bring myself to give voice to such things, unless there are some exceptions ofcourse.. not assertive enough.\n\nSame, love being around people, but need a good amount of time away from the entire world... and so on.\n\nI guess, like I said, stereotype expresses our ISFJ-ishness rather than the trait we literally possess... and also, the way we come across from the outside too.. You may look warm and mild even if you don't forgive and are intolerant to bullshit - because the manifestation of a person's psyche in his persona involves so many variables, than just a single emotion.\n
3	Completely agree on everything you said and hence why i dont really think mbti is reliable haha
2	Going along with what @dee-vee said about XSFJ's being everyone's moms (which doesn't make sense statistically), people also don't realize that basing XSFJ on their mom and older people alone becomes very misleading. As a function, Si is about our subjective past experiences... Mine, as a millennial who basically grew up on the internet, are probably going to be very different from your mother's. Same with younger XSXJ types, many of whom might actually somewhat resemble XNXP's in terms of outlook on life. Just that the method of process is different.
2	It’s hard to accept stereotypes from your own perspective. That is, it’s easier to describe others than oneself because you cannot really do it without bias.\n\nUnderstand that the stereotype descriptions are relative to the perceiver. To an INTP, for example, we might see anyone who has ANY flaw in reasoning as illogical, so to them everyone is stupid. \n\nIt’s all relative, and give it a chance that the descriptions/stereotypes may be partly true for a majority (not necessarily point cases like you).

7	Tell me your pros and cons of being an ISFJ? Including, what is some "you know you're an ISFJ when you..."	
15	You know you’re an ISFJ when you secretly hope your friend will cancel your plans, because you’re afraid if you’re the one to cancel, they’ll stop including you. 
6	Hey I like being an ISFJ overall. Although being a male ISFJ has been difficult in trying to fit in with a society where most males are thinkers. \n\nPros: Dependable, Responsible, Great at Following Through, Compassionate, Empathetic, Sees the best in others, Good at Planning\n\nCons: Difficult living in the moment, can be conflict averse, taking criticism to personally, difficulty making drastic lifestyle changes\n\nYou know when you’re an ISFJ when someone starts crying and feeling bad in the room and you start to feel bad for them. 
14	Both pros, cons, you know when you’re an isfj:\nPros: You get along with mostly everyone (maybe excluding entjs and some intjs lol, our Fe wears on them). Organized (Si). Impeccable subjective memory (Si). You know how to present yourself appropriately in most situations (Fe). You can stick to a routine/habit no problem (ie workout 4x/week, eat yogurt daily) (Si). You know how to take care of yourself and others physically (sexually or otherwise) (Si, Fe). Once you’re a little older, you don’t get as butthurt over people who are direct (Ti). Once you’re older, you become really open minded (Ne). \n\nCons follow the pros: You question your intelligence (maybe that’s a me problem, or a 3rd Ti problem). You’re fearful of unknowns (4th Ne). Annoying subjective memory (Si). Your debate skills are shit, on the fly is not your style (Ti/ne 3rd, 4th). You can miss the point of it all (4th Ne). You’re not efficient (Polar Te). You’re not great in the moment (Whitty) (ignoring Se, 4th Ne). You fear the future (role Ni). You vaguely know what you want (Fi) But have an innate need to make sure others get want they want first (Fe). You feel lost in life (4th Ne soooo many possibilities!). \n\nSource: 29 year old Isfj who is obsessed with mbti & Socionics. XD
7	Have any of you guys dated another ISFJ? Would you guys date another ISFJ?	I think it would be some upsides and some downsides to dating a person with my same personality. \n\nUpsides:\nWe would probably both take the relationship seriously\nWe would both probably be caring and loyal mates. \nWe would also enjoy a nice and quiet lifestyle.\nAlso, we would probably be accepting of each other’s flaws \nWe would also put a lot of time and effort into the relationship.\nDownsides:\nThe relationship might get boring overtime since we both would be risk or change averse. \nIt might be hard to even initiate this relationship at first since ISFJs are known for being shy and reserved when it comes to meeting new people. \nSince we have similar strengths and weaknesses, we won’t complement each other. \nThis might also make it difficult for us to grow and develop into well-rounded individuals. \n\nI know the say opposite attract but have any of y’all dated another ISFJ. Would any of y’all date another ISFJ? I would love to hear some stories and experiences. Thanks \n

3	I dated another ISFJ for a short time, and I ended precisely because of it. He was a wonderful person and one of the most caring people I had met, but it felt like I could read his mind too easily. There was no surprise, and nothing we could really learn from one another, at least that’s how it felt at the time. I could always understand exactly why he was doing or saying what he was doing/saying, which sounds like an advantage, but sometimes you find their flaws are exactly the same past ones you had, and sometimes they’re bigger\n\nIt was also really frustrating because I ended up having to initiate all the plans, which we clearly both preferred not to be the one to do. Honestly, I could go on for so many reasons why dating another ISFJ wasn’t my cup of tea but, hey, circumstances are different which each ISFJ. It’s always worth a try. 
3	Great question!\n\nI have not dated, however I have worked with a few.\n\nAs a fellow introvert who prefers listening than talking when I'm meeting a new person, it's tough. You have two people who are shyly examining each other wondering who will make the first move.\n\nHonestly we are fantastic people once we give each other a chance. ISFJ's are notoriously difficult to get close to, but once we establish that rapport and realize the other is a genuinely kind person, things go swimmingly.\n\nISFJ's are GREAT coworkers, btw. My absolute favorite to work with professionally. Unsure about romantically. It could work theoretically, since we generally are better with people similar to us, but the other comments here say otherwise.
2	I'm an ISFJ, and I've had 3 ENTP boyfriends so....nope lol I find myself more attracted to extroverts because I need that extra push to drive me out of my comfort zone. Also I feel like the combination of two ISFJs would be A LOT of emotions but also a lot of repressed feelings/emotions, and the communication would suffer because neither party would want to express their issues. I think relationships are about balancing and challenging each other and while being with someone who understands how you fundamentally operate would be nice, ultimately I think it would get boring and/or lead to resentment.
1	I did date a male ISFJ for a little, but he was too boring and conventional for me. I crave differences in a relationship and for my SO to push me out of my comfort zone....which didn’t really happen. 
1	I wouldn't mind dating another ISFJ. Not all ISFJs are the same.. However, generally speaking, it'd be great actually, to be in a relationship with an ISFJ man.. 
3	Is she ISFJ?	So I've been on a few dates with a girl that I would say is ISFJ because:  \n>she very much tries to serve the group without showing off (Fe 2nd),  \n \n>she likes to tell things from her past (hours or years old), and is aware and cares for minute details (Si dom),  \n \n>she's not very incline to try new adventures, but sound like she'd like to have tried them afterwards (inf Ne)\n\nBut :  \n>She displays an easy going "we'll decide that later" attitude, which I'm wondering if she's picking up on from my Ne..  \n \n>She's prone to looking up for information about a subject on her phone (Wikipedia friendly)  \n \n>She's reserved and we haven't been moving fast at all (I've decided to let her have her rythm, which is obviously slow) but she was the one to send me the first message (online dating) and to propose we met (after maybe 20 messages)\n\nIs that ISFJ compatible?\n\nI am an ENTP guy, and we're both 30 btw\n\nEdit: formatting
8	I’m an ISFJ and that sounds a lot like myself! So I would say yes
5	*Squee!* Another entp-isfj story, yay! I post all to often on here about the wonderful dual ship of this type. Enjoy, man. It’s quite a fantastical ride. :D
1	[deleted]
1	>"She's prone to looking up for information about a subject on her phone"\n\nlol, omg... everyone does this\n\nyou just cut us off a slice here - I could make a case for almost any type using pieces of info - but sure, maybe\n\nbut to be honest? if you were truly xNxx and she was truly xSxx, the biggest indication would be simple: conversation. so...
1	Sounds like me.. almost.\n\nGet her to take the MBTI test :D 
1	Sounds exactly like me (ISFJ). I have an INTP boyfriend which is great for interesting discussions, but I wish he understood me better sometimes.
8	How do you deal with others emotions?	I’ve noticed that as an ISFJ, I tend to absorb other people’s emotions and lately that includes a lot of bad ones from my coworkers! The store I work at is going through changes and not everyone is handling it well. My question is, how do you eat yourself out of that?? I’ve been trying to get back to being positive!
5	Yes! Absorbing others feelings is so tough. \n\nI can usually get out of it with a few things: comedy TV rerun, playing with my dog, exercise. Just got to absorb energy from another source that's positive. 
4	I wonder if all isfj people are empaths.\n\nYou can check out /r/Empaths for help on  your "issue" (which is not an issue)
2	Judith Orloff has written some really helpful stuff about absorbing other people's emotions and what to do about it; she's very helpful to empaths imho. 
1	Thank you!!
5	I'm not sure if I am an ISFJ.. Need some help.	Hey guy's,  I need some help to figure out If I'm really an ISFJ.  Here is some traits about me.\n\n.   Introverted, but If I get to know you I can be extremely silly.  I love making off the wall remarks if I'm comfortable with you.\n\n\n.  I hate traditions and religion.  Personally I find the both of these concepts pointless to me. To each his own I guess \n\n.  I love helping people,  but only those who needs it and want it. I don't want to save the world.  I just want to help people who really needs it. \n\n\n.   I'm not a pushover.  Most people considered me a really sweet guy.  However,  if I think you're getting disrespectful I will check you. \n\n.   I have an obsession  with my past.  I'm always thinking about my mom,stepdad,  and other love ones who passed away or left. Including my past mistakes. \n\n.  I'm really hard on myself.  If I make any mistakes at work or anything in general I overthink on how I can prevented my mistakes. This sometimes leads to a bad depression episode.  As an heavy equipment operator apprentice, I'm extremely hard on myself.  I even had my boss tell me more than once I'm to hard on myself and I am doing a good job.\n\n\n.  I'm always thinking about the future and wondering how my life is going to play out. \n\n\n. I am extremely loyal to my friends and family.  But if you betray my trust or hurt me,  I will cut you out of  my life permanently.  Including family. \n\n\nI have taken the personality test multiple times.  I was given INFJ, INTJ,  and ISFJ. I honestly don't know what type I am anymore.  Sorry for the grammar mistakes. 
9	INFJ and ISFJ are very similar, and are basically the same person, living in two different worlds. The INFJ lives in the conceptual world, and the ISFJ lives in the real world. They both have amazing memories, although for the ISFJ it is about concrete details about their past, and for the INFJ it is about conceptual things, such as stories, things they've read, and quotes. I never knew this about myself until people told me. Yeah apparently I like quoting people  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  ISFJ tend to think about their past with fondness, and with a bit of a rose-colored tint. When they view the future, it is always with dread and uncertainty. When I think about my future, I have hope. When I look back on my past, there is only regret. The future is a frightening place for ISFJs, who only have an inferior Ne to process it, which translates to many uncertain and frightening possibilities. But INFJs Ni tend to come up with one accurate prediction about the future, thus ... even if it is a negative future, they will be well prepared for it. ISFJs tend to be neater -INFJs messier.\n\nThat's all I can think of for now. I hope you found it helpful!\n\nsource: INFJ with an ISFJ sister
1	From this, I'd say ISFJ\n\nThey tend to be much harder on themselves regarding past mistakes - it's a common theme from ISxJ (and ISxJs who are mistyped and think they're INxJ - Ni's don't care.) They also both regard their futures, but in different ways - INFJs with a calm, singular knowingness, and ISFJ with more concern or concrete planning\n\nISxJ's aren't defined by being "traditional and religion." While many are, many aren't as well.\n\nThe real difference, as goodthankyou noted, is: ISFJ lives and breathes concrete; INFJ lives and breathes conceptual\n\nI just wrote [a post on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/905xaj/the_difference_between_isfj_and_infj_si_vs_ni/) in /infj if you want to read it.
21	How do I seduce you?	I'm in love with an ISFJ. \n\nI have never felt this way about anyone else before. Currently she is truly the love of my life. \n\nSo I'm asking y'all who share her personality type on this fine subreddit, \n\nwhat is the key to your heart? 
24	ISFJs tend to overextend themselves to help others however they can, especially at the cost of their own happiness, health and energy. Try to notice all these little things that your ISFJ love does for both you and others, and tell her that you appreciate how much she cares for others. Even the strong and giving need validation as well. Stay in tune with her emotions, and acknowledge them - ISFJs have so many feelings that are oftentimes waiting to burst. \n\nGood luck!
26	Humor. Be loving and logical. Don’t be overly romantic in a traditional sense. Ooy gooy things like flowers and chocolate that don’t serve practical purpose make me uncomfortable, unless it’s a hobby/interest (ie put some thought into your love expression). Be sweet but not a pushover. Be bold and witty, but not pushy. Alternatively, gently nudge me to do things out of my comfort zone because my growth = your growth. Obviously this is particular to this isfj. Be curious. Ask about our day. Out of curiosity, what’s your type?
9	For me personally I enjoy it when people point out the positive little things I do for others. Like if I were to make you coffee because I knew you were running late for work and can't stop by a Starbucks, I would appreciate some appreciation like "the coffee you made for me this morning really helped me out today!".\n\nAnother thing that I personally like is when people think about me randomly and tell me. When I am going to Walmart, I always text or call my SO to ask if they need anything. It's a small thing but it tells me that you were thinking of me out of the blue and that makes my heart HAPPY. \n\nOne tip is that how your ISFJ love displays love and affection to you. If they spend a lot of time with you giving you compliments, buying you gifts, or helping you out with tasks then **you should exhibit the same type of affection and attention ** because that's how we would like to be loved. \n\nAlso, we LOVE traditions. If we normally go eat pizza on our anniversary, for each anniversary, keep that tradition but Amp it up a little here and there to make it special each anniversary. Such as instead of pizza at your place last anniversary, why not take a small road trip to a scenic area and having pizza there. You can probably see where i am going with this. \n\nWe are very sentimental and for me, the easiest thing to make my heart melt are handwritten cards. And cake.\n\nSo to summarize:\n\n\n1. Make me feel appreciated \n2. Surprise me by thinking about me randomly and letting me know about it \n3. Make some traditions and play it off like it's exclusively a thing "just between the two of you" \n4. Sentimental acts of love\n5. Food. \n\n\nEdit: formatting and typos and added a summary for convenience.
3	IDK the key to my heart.. but I can say it takes time for us to really get close to you.. Be gentle, patient, steady, offer stability, be compassionate, loving, caring, acknowledge the care/concern she shows, be direct - ask what you want, tell what you want.. \n\nBeing supportive of her hobbies or interests, showing her better way to find a creative outlet.. Like someone said here, we have so many feelings and are on the verge of bursting :) It would be excellent if you both have shared interest.. most usually, an ISFJ tries to adopt hobbies of their loved one, but if you have different one - be supportive.. Indulge in her imaginative side (we have a rich inner world that we like to escape to from time to time - not at the cost of our duty/responsibility tho). Show your imaginative world. And yes, no melodrama or overly dramatic emotions..\n\nI like people that don't take themselves overly seriously or have a good sense of humor, especially in the face of problems. PRACTICALITY, really - people who have a simplistic approach towards life can reduce our own stress, and I personally find that quality very appealing - simplicity.. But more than anything, be her rock, a silent warm presence of stability.\n\nBest wishes to you and your ISFJ :D 
2	Give her plenty of alone time, and do things with her that she likes to do. Personally I prefer compliments over gifts and cuddles. But that might have nothing to do with the fact that I am ISFJ... 
1	I would say just be nice and considerate towards us. But also flirt with us and tease us a little bit. I don’t know about other ISFJs but I have a offbeat and sometimes dark sense of humor. Also do things to help us because we often help other people that we might not pay attention to our own needs. When we do help you showing appreciation is great too. We might not ask for it but we do like to be thanked. Another way you could is just to be direct and ask her out which you ENTJs should be good at.
1	Look me directly in the eyes when you speak to me. Touch me (not in an over the top way, but a subtle way). Engage my mind. Be open with your body language so I feel more comfortable. Compliment me on something you like about me. 
0	Say "Hello", and wait for a reply
8	ISFJ and ENFP advice	ENFP female here curious about ISFJ male. I met him and have never found someone so easy to be around. I felt listened to, respected, adored, and vice versa. Constant smiling and fun. We saw each other for a few weeks pretty consistently and we had sex multiple times. His work schedule changed and he had to go out of town for a week so we just finished two weeks without seeing each other. \n\nBefore he left I was a little upset because we didn’t get to see each other even though we both said we wanted to. He calmed me down,  called me when I asked him to and we talked through it. We both might be in a position of moving in the next few months, him sooner than I but neither a sure thing by any means. He said he doesn’t want to get too deep into anything because of this. I asked if he liked me and he said “yes, and I WILL see you when i get back.” We talked minimally while he was gone, random Snapchats here and there. Mostly every other day or so I’d send one and he was always responsive. The last day he sent me one that was incredibly sweet and specific to me in a “thinking of you” sort of way. \n\nWell, he just got back to town and he text me a bit (initiated by me) about his trip. He was with a bunch of work buddies there and now he told me he has to work extra shifts at his other job for his coverage while he was gone. So I know he is going to be busy. I told him I missed him and he responded with:\n\n“I had some time to think too. I’m not saying I didn’t miss you but I think what’s going on is that the introvert in me is really coming out right now. I tend to go through phases where I just don’t like being around people. That’s also kind of how my past relationships have gone. We’ll hang out for a little while, then I just kind of shut down and stop talking. I don’t know what my problem is. I just have a hard time figuring out what it is that I want I guess.”\n\nIs this his way of breaking things off with me but in a let me down gently type deal? I know I don’t know him that well yet but he is such an incredible human and I want to keep getting to know him. I like him and I don’t mind giving him space if that is what he needs. I am just so confused. I explained my side to him and hope it doesn’t scare him off.
1	I’m not afraid of you guys hurting my feelings. They are already hurt and I am just want to find some clarity or see a different perspective. And yes I am giving him space and working on myself for now. Help?
1	I think he is trying to let you down softly. \n\nI do like my own space and time to myself but I've never have shut down and not talked. If a woman smothers me (eg sends a messages every day and wants to hangout every time we are free it usually wears me out) i am usually fine as long as I have 2 to 3 nights a week to do my own thing. \n\nSo if the you really do like the guy maybe give him space and check in a week later but usually when someone goes on break like that it's usually the end. 
0	How do I find an ISFJ man?	Hi! Im on tinder and wonder if you ISFJ guys are there? And how to spot you ? What are typical photos you would post, do you write a bio text, and about What? Do you tend to ask for IRL meetup right away or do you make long txt conversations? Sorry for alltid questions, but would really like to find myself an ISFJ guy; you seem awesome! - ESTP girl . And btw What attracts you? 
7	Uh my main pictures are just of warm smiles and my profiles just gets to the point of my hobbies and stuff and that I want a long term relationship and no hookups
2	I’d ask a lot of questions and try and meet for coffee. I don’t use tinder or any online dating app at all now as it feels like a flock of seagulls trying to grab a scrap of food. I get more value out of a singles night or speed dating (I still haven’t met anybody that I would consider normal though)\n\n
2	Well on Tinder I just have pictures of me. I also have pictures of me at places I have been like France. I use Tinder every know and then but I know Tinder can be a hookup site. I like to get to know a girl somewhat before I ask to meet up with her. Lol I hope one day to find an ESTP girl. 
1	You can spot ISFJs by requesting anyone who chats with you to do the MBTI test before even saying hello to you.\n\nDon't say that you're looking for ISFJs or anyone will pretend they're ISFJ for the sake of opportunities

3	wow this is so scarily accurate. I actually used to call my isfj a knight in shining armor
6	Doing a study on sexuality comparisons among MB types. The survey's on sex, so it ranges from your views on sex to your preferences/kinks. Totally anonymous, all questions are optional. No essays. Only takes about 15 mins. I'll share the results :)	
3	Click the post title to go to the survey :)
3	Alright, so what are the results? 
2	me sensor me like sex\n\nanyhooo. done.
1	I’m not here to do surveys, no thank you. 
1	Oh man why did you deactivate it!!!
0	The whole thing seems to assume as a premise that sexual immorality is normal or acceptable.
2	Why does my ISFJ (female) friend have trouble understanding how I am feeling or what I am thinking?	I am an ISFP (male) and one of my closest ISFJ friends is really funny, nice, supportive, etc. and I am NOT saying this applies to all ISFJ's at all, this is the only one that I've gotten close with so I am wondering if she is just an exception.\n\n The one thing that I dislike about her is that while she CAN understand when I am annoyed or frustrated or sad (most of the time), she won't have any clue what it's like to experience what I am experiencing, if that makes sense.\n\nI know she is Fe and I am Fi dominant, but still, I feel like ISFJ's are good at listening to someone and understanding why they feel how they feel?  She will feel sad when I am sad, but she won't know what to say or understand unless I explain it over and over and over (but still won't know what to say).\n\nI am not trying to stereotype, I just want to know whether this is her problem specifically. Don't worry I still love her and all you ISFJ's 
3	>she CAN understand when I am annoyed or frustrated or sad, she won't have any clue what it's like to experience what I am experiencing\n\nmy spouse is an isfj (male) and is the same way.....
3	I'm ISFJ... and I'm a little bit like this.. we are emotional, but not exactly good with verbalizing emotions.. \n\nI do everything to help my loved ones feel understood or feel better - through actions, gestures or just sticking around doing things for them or comforting them with my body language.. but I tend to fall short verbally. I've improved a lot over the years, but I struggle very much to speak up during emotional times.. Sometimes I don't say much when my loved one is very upset, because it would look like I am trivializing the issue with my words that would seem superficial for the way they feel so I render a silent shoulder to lean on.\n\nI hope this answers your doubt? :) Does she comfort or support you? 
1	Well you two have 0 preferred functions in common so this is totally to be expected.\n\nIt is also very likely you don't understand her nearly as well as you think you do.
4	Is there anything (a moment, lifestyle, upbringing...) you believe shaped you into who you are today?	I'm interested in how a person's circumstances shape their personality. I believe my own personality was in large part determined by my upbringing, and I can point specifically to my father, my religious background, and my first relationship as large influences on who I am today. But these experiences, without going into detail, are specific to someone who types as INTP.\n\nI'm curious about the experiences that might shape an ISFJ. I'm planning a story with a protagonist who loosely fits into that type, and I need some inspiration and reference for backstory and character details.\n\nWhat from your past makes you *you*?
2	my mom's alcoholism. being an adult child of an alcoholic --and understanding that that's a THING that shaped my emotional development was significant. 
1	The entirety of our existence shapes us, most importantly though we shape ourselves regardless of circumstance.\n\nThough how can we define ourselves at all? "We" only exist as a thought in our sense of self. True self is without form! :)
1	everything known and unknown to me have been directly and indirectly shaping me into who I am being today... \n\nI'm ISFJ. Sorry my post doesn't help much, but that's what I believe :-)
1	Religious upbringing that made me resent religion but it’s engrained in me to BELIEVE in the higher power- without practicing. \n\nLost my father at an early age (cancer) and since he was our source of income, we struggled a lot financially. For 20+ years, I’ve been at the poverty line, and still at 26 I’m struggling more than ever before. But that’s also my fault bc as an ISFJ, I tend to use all of my resources to help/do things for my loved ones. \n\nAnyway, the whole religious thing has prevented and still prevents me from experiences in life, because in my mind they’re ‘bad things’, but most people would consider as fun/normal. Plus, those things are extra and not in the budget. I guess they go hand-in-hand. 
3	Careers - ISFJ	As an ISFJ myself, I have certainly had a tough time acclimating to any one job as a result of being so particular about things. I'm starting to think there's no end to my need to have things done a certain way which seems to me to be the logical way, but not always the way others want done. \n\nThere doesn't seem to be a whole lot of good careees for us besides psychologists and radio announcers - both of which are very freelance and independant type jobs, with minimal tangible evidence of the hard work and a lot of verbal evidence. \n\nWhat are some jobs that are *best-suited* for ISFJs in contrast to jobs for others? \n\n(Also, I've been giving podcasting some thought, but I'm afraid that might just be setting myself up for failure?) 
5	I like having projects and being able to become an expert in matter that has specific rules. I always read about ISFJ doing work that requires compassion but that sounds absolutely draining to me. I already take care of my family. I need some time where I’m not having to mother the world. \n\nI’m an HRIS Specialist. (Human Resources Information System.). It deals with maintaining data, configuring the system, working on integrations. It’s fantastic. I get assigned puzzles like... create a security policy that that captures this group of people and give them access to view x on this group of people but not on y group. 
3	Im a preschool teacher. I dont know how well that fits but it fits well with me.

2	Way late to answer here, but I’ve been in auto repair for almost 20 years. It tends to be detail oriented for the most part, helpful and validating because at a base level because as long as it’s a business that deals with the general public? Odds are fair that you are helping someone and they actually do usually appreciate it. \n\nAlso you are theoretically left on your own for a good deal of the work day. The money isn’t bad if you’re good at it, either, that’s always a career positive. Maybe not the answer you were looking for, but I hope it added a different perspective. :)
2	I fond that (as an ISFJ), I work best in restaurants. “Fast-casual” is my favorite. Management is great because you get your alone time for paperwork, inventory, etc., and the teams are usually smaller/more intimate, so you get to form those close-ish relationships. You still have to put on your best face for the guests but the balance is good!! \nAlso, logistics is good. I’m currently working on a team and since we’re great workers, I get a mix of being a stocker, backroom team member, and cashier when necessary. These are good bc you have an assigned task to do- something to complete, you know, and get to take breaks in that (we can get caught up) by helping guests! \n-I really like making someone’s day!\n(I always wanted to be a teacher for young children !) \nHope this helps!! 
2	Academic Survey	Hello I am a student at University and I am collecting data on Big-5, type indicator, and cluster B personality characteristics. The IRB and the Human consent pages are in included in the link. At the end of data collection I will be giving away amazon gift cards. The information is on the last page. I appreciate anyone willing to take the time. The average response time is around 15 minutes. Thank you again.\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/T2DWFXG
5	MBTI-themed Discord server!	## Cognition is a Discord server with MBTI theme with already quite a few ISFJs, with a big intellectual focus and emotional support, as well as some memes and a lot of fun :) Check it out if you want to meet other people but you don't like having to leave your room, like me!\n\nAnd if you need any help once you join you can contact me in there, my handle is McNoot :)\n\n[https://discord.gg/yHZn6Ap](https://discord.gg/yHZn6Ap)
3	Why are there so many MBTI discords?\n\nYoud think all these public ones woulda merged or affiliated or something by now
39	Thank you ISFJs for the wonderful things you do for everyone!	Do you feel underappreciated? Please share if you do! I'd love to talk and learn with you.\n\nPlease never stop being you! I see many ISFJ who sell themselves short, if only they realized how much of a positive impact they really have!\n\nI learned a painful life lesson when I drifted away from someone dear to me who typed as ISFJ once. I failed to appreciate her properly and now I cannot at all. Please know that you are appreciated for who you are and that sometimes especially a high Ni type may struggle with showing appreciation if we are immature. I am positively affected by ISFJ very regularly in terms of learning practical growth and emotional comfort. Your presence often feels like a campfire for my soul!\n\nThank you for listening to my rambling! It may seem like I'm lost at sea and dumping my emotions, I apologize if that seems to be so. Live happy, friends!
7	Thanks so much; I needed this.
7	I don't really know if I have that effect on people. I often find myself second guessing if I truly belong here. I know I often have felt this though. Like I give so much for others only to always feel like I myself have no one to turn to when I'm in need. 
3	This is always so hard to believe for myself. So thank you. 
3	You’re awesome for taking the time to write this. I love the “campfire for my soul” description. Emotionally supporting others makes us feel the same way! ❤️
2	Def have felt under appreciated by my SO before. He (ENTJ) never thought I did anything towards THE common goal we had. Unfortunately, we take under appreciation to the core but I guess that it is part of the F in us :)
1	He didn’t see me working hard enough towards “the goal”, which was his first priority. Everything else came in second (ENTJs are very goal focused). So providing the emotional support I needed at times was never a priority. It didn’t work out unfortunately...
1	I have an ESTP partner who's pretty all-over the place and not super in-tune with feelings, and I needed to hear this. Thank you - your words mean the world to me. 
18	35 Signs That You Are An ISFJ	
5	Very accurate, hahah. :) Although I must say, sometimes a little change can stir me up sometimes (e.g.realigning my room). ;)
2	99% got rate on me! This would be a nice little infographic. 
2	Nice someone cared enough to notice !! 😉
1	Almost all are completely correct, this is great! 
1	Almost all accurate, I feel like I might want to show this to some of my friends actually...
1	this is so accurate. at least 90% accurate. I really wish I wasn't some of these traits though.  such as caring too much about what others think of me..
12	What would you like others to do for you when stressed?	
20	Clean the house. When I’m stressed seeing clutter just puts me over the edge. 
8	I've found this article to be pretty helpful. https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2015/08/02/how-each-mbti-type-reacts-to-stress-and-how-to-help/
4	Leave me be while you're figuring out which route to take to fix my problem(s) because I of course cannot make up my mind. Also tell me you love me. 
2	Listen to me vent, then get me talking so I can  think about the real facts in the situation versus what cognitive distortion I'm ruminating about. Hugs from close friends or my husband also help. 
3	Be present. I tend to want to work through the solution myself and don't want to HAVE to talk through the process.
2	Be present and listen without actually trying to figure out my problem. When asked provide input, cook me some comfort food and tell me we will figure it out.
2	Well, most of the times I just want them to leave me alone and let me recharge. I usually go for a walk, or a movie by myself.
1	HUG ME and tell me I LOVE YOU
11	What do you do for a living?	Fellow ISFJs:\n\nWhat do you do for a living?\nIs this what you WANT to be doing?\nDo you know what you want to be doing?\nPracticality and resources aside, what would you do to contribute to society if money wasn't a factor?\n\nI'm asking because I don't understand how any one person can *know* what they want to do with their lives "career" wise. Going to a 9-5 seems silly to me. Dressing up in professional clothes most people wouldn't otherwise wear, because it's company policy, seems silly to me (perhaps that's POLR Te talking). My INFJ family member knew from the time she was like 8, she wanted to be a professor, and she got her Masters at a very young age, and became a professor. I've had no clue, and still at the age of 29 don't. The idea of one linear path sounds boring. I'd love to do random things to make a living, but the lack of stability in that seems incredibly stressful. I'd love to podcast (who doesn't nowadays), but I feel I'm too boring, insecure, and lack the drive and discipline to meet people in which I can team up with to make it happen. I'd love to own a meditation studio, and provide yoga and meditation classes, but don't have the overhead, connections, or business know-how (not that I couldn't acquire that). But then thinking about what that really means, the back-end work, doesn't sound appealing in reality (just the teaching aspect, which isn't a feasible steady income stream). Am I destined, then, to work a basic 9-5? I very much hate that idea, but I also don't have any other ideas of how to make a feasible, stable living. I went to college and got a bachelors in an industry I don't want to be in, and got the degree mostly because "that's just what you do". Just feeling lost, without a life path or passion to pursue.
5	I arrived at a field that (for now) I am really happy in. It took a lot of years and careful consideration of three questions: What am I interested in, what are my strengths, and what need can I fill in the world (ie. be compensated for). Somewhere in the intersection of those three questions might be your answer. \n\nAbout the 9-5 thing.. I recommend reading the first chapter of *So Good They Can't Ignore You,* which basically debunks the myth that fulfilling careers come from following your passions. The author argues that interests are actually irrelevant to the qualities that actually make fulfilling careers - having autonomy, control, creativity, impact and one other...  The point is, qualities of fulfilling careers can be instilled in any field, regardless of whether or not it is your passion, which you might just make you begin to loathe anyway. Instead the book explains how to build those qualities into your job, regardless of the chosen field. Highly recommend.
6	Hi! I'm a registered nurse with 2 different jobs right now, one in the mental health field and the other in primary care. Before that I worked in a nursing home as an aide and really liked it. I love being able to help people get healthier or improve their quality of life. I have worked 9-5 a nurse but "once a nurse always a nurse". I try to help others as much as I can even when my paid shift is done :) 
4	I’m a registered nurse. 
5	I'm a critical care RN and it's a perfect fit. I work 3 days a week, wear scrubs. I make good money and feel good about my contribution to the world. Sometimes I get to just put my head down and work (sedated, ventilated patients) and sometimes I get to be chatty (family members or more stable patients). There's lots of order, problem solving and multi tasking. I'm def part of a team working for the best patient outcomes but have a ton of autonomy. I really love my job.
4	I’m currently a student, majoring in chemistry and minoring in computer science. I want to eventually end up in some sort of lab/research job. Lack of variety doesn’t really bother me, as long as what I’m doing is intellectually stimulating and interests me.
3	I’m a dental technician. I work in a lab, on a computer, headphones in all day listening to podcasts.\n\nI would rather have no job or maybe work for a youtuber or company like DFTBA Records/Complexly. Something behind the scenes.\n\nIf money wasn’t a thing I don’t know how I would contribute to society. Maybe take care of cats lmao. 
3	I'm an insurance agent. I'm good at it but it's definitely not what I want to be doing. I'm actually researching other career paths now. I kind of have no clue what I really want to do, but so far I'm leaning towards something in the computer science field. 
3	I work and am completing my master's in environmental policy and sustainable development! I also do some work in refugee assimilation programs a few hours a week. This is definitely what I want to be doing, but I'm also open to getting a PhD in the future and going into teaching and research because I enjoy that as well. \n\nI was previously working in HR and it was really not my thing. I was like you, did my undergrad in whatever because it's just what you're meant to do, and I was miserable. I made it work, scraped together enough motivation to get a decent GPA and did a bunch of extracurriculars, but I knew I wouldn't enjoy working in that field (and I really didn't). \n\nHowever, I agree with the other comment that says you don't have to follow your passions to have a fulfilling careers (for one thing, this is just unrealistic considering how many people work in family businesses and inherited occupations worldwide); you can find fulfilment in certain aspects of any work or outside of work - I initially started working with refugees during my previous job to just feel good about something, and it really helped.
3	I'm a 33 year-old spanish ISFJ. I also got a degree in an industry I don't want to be in (Civil Engineering). I'm currently trying to become a high school teacher, because I enjoy sharing my knowledge with other people, especially teenagers.
3	R&D in the alcohol industry with a great company. It's been a long road to this point. A lot of hard work and hours but it all paid off!
3	I work in event/production management and I love it! It's a little bit of the same thing every day, but also varies depending on the client/event, so I have a good balance of stability and variety that really suits me. At the moment I'm maintaining a department that I'm not totally sure is a good fit with me (more technical than people focused) but it's fine for now and is a good building block for my next step.\n\nI sort of just... ended up here by being at the right place at the right time. I wouldn't say it's my life's passion or anything, but it's mentally and emotionally fulfilling and I generally enjoy what I do so that's really all I can ask for.
3	I just graduated high school and I'm working full time running machines at a cutting die manufacturing company my grandpa started over 60 years ago. 
3	27F isfj lawyer here. Ever since I could remember I have always wanted to be a lawyer. Now that Im here I've realized that there are so many aspects of the job that don't bode well with me. For example (no surprise) it is extremely adversarial in nature which goes against my need to be well liked and to be seen as a nice person. It may also be the quarter life crisis talking haha
3	(26,F, pos) I’m currently working logistics in a retail store, and do a lot of the same process every day (with little extra projects). I work AMs, so there’s some quiet, productive time before the store gets busy, which is wonderful! But I don’t mind saying hi and helping guests!! \n\nI never had a set “career” that I wanted to go after, but I always felt like if I HAD to choose (people were expecting me to go to college), I would have tried to be a teacher for elementary children. \n\nBut what I really enjoy is cooking/baking, but despite the compliments and affirmation I’ve received on my abilities, I also never thought I was good enough to consider being a real chef as one of my options.. \nBtw most of my work experience has been in the food industry and it’s been a few years but I’ll be working in a restaurant again soon!!! ~excitement~
3	I'm a sonographer so I do ultrasounds in a clinic setting. 
3	I’m a Registered Nurse and will possibly be joining the army next year. :) 
2	I can't tell you much. \n\nJust want to say, from being around INFJ for a while, a lot of them feel very closely the same, your family member is a lucky one (so yes PolR Te may be a thing)
2	I’ve worked all sorts of jobs trying to find one that I really liked. I was an EMT, a Chef, an IT Tech Support Person and now I’m working Human Resources.\n\nI really like Human Resources to be able to share my knowledge and take care of people. Plus can shape help a lot of the newer employees and help young and inexperienced ones some good life knowledge.
2	I work in care (of course) but I'm making a move to working in the homeless sector (I'm homeless myself!).  Hoping it'll give me better opportunities and actually move up in the sector.  I want to go back to University to do a degree in mental health (I have a degree in psychology/sociology) and hopefully this will give me some experience in that field too.

9	Isfjs and their need for perfection	As an ENFP, I find that ISFJs spend lots of time attempting to appear perfect to society, and will go great lengths to maintain their image. \n\nMy mother is an ISFJ, and countless times she has told me that the things I say are inappropriate and that not everyone has to know my business, and that I need to appear a certain way because of XYZ reasons and XYZ perceptions of me from others if I don’t do so. While I care about what others think, my perfectionism appears most in creative works in which I immerse myself, particularly poetry and other creative outlets as I’m always striving for poetic meaning and imagery and prose that accurately and poetically explains concepts, ideas, symbolic elements, relationship dynamics, emotion, etc.\n\nWhy do ISFJs feel the need to impose their expectations of perfection onto others instead of trying to understanding differences?
20	We expect perfection for ourselves but are very accepting of others. We are very ordered and aware of societal perceptions. If she is worried about how you are perceived it’s another manifestation of trying to protect you from societies judgement and not because you are lacking. 
7	I think you're right, ISFJs definitely try to maintain their self-defined perfect image. And everyone's image is different, but I know that I always work so that people will only see me in the way I want them to see me. \n\nThat said, I don't think *projecting* that image onto someone else is a part of ISFJ. I think that's just your mom. 
8	As an ISFJ, I struggle with this a lot. And it’s brought to my attention often. It isn’t that I don’t accept others but it seems to stem from having found the most efficient way to do things and those methods have been proven to yield success. \n\nAs caretakers, we have a subconscious need to “save people from themselves” and to protect others from harm. The downside is that we don’t always see the other path or we are not fully confident in the outcome of said path. We also tend to forget that there is more learning in failure than there is in success, sometimes. \n\nIt sounds like your mom is genuinely trying to give you advice, but going about it in the wrong way. I suggest being clear about who you are and your preferred methods. I also suggest reminding her that sometimes she needs to let you fail so that you can learn from your mistakes. Us ISFJs need that reminder every now and then. 
1	If we have one less person to worry about all the better. Bluntly! But in all honesty the others here describe the feeling very well. Always want the best of everyone.
1	You're talking about ISFJs (plural) while reporting a single example. The sampling is insufficient, there is also a precise kind of relationship between you and said ISFJ.\n\nOther types can impose their views as well, that's not an ISFJ thing - but you're going to find this case particularly bothersome because Si is your inferior and there is a Fe vs Fi clash.\n\nSi is not necessarily close-mindedness and vice-versa.
1	Call outs like this to ISFJs annoying qualities always make me think “shit....yeah I do that. “ I just feel like apologizing cause like yeah no one should do that. It’s just like some weird compulsion we have to control things. 
-1	Not necessarily, but a lot of them are. Or at least the ones I ‘ve met unfortunately. Also I think its a Sensor trait to be close minded of a lot of things due to their tendency to follow traditions and culture taught to them by their families. This I’m sure you’re familiar with or read too many times as I have. So it’s not just an ISFJ issue, it’s an SJ issue. Isfjs just to impose themselves in Fe related matters as opposed to other things like excessive logic. \n\nBtw, I’m not biased in my opinion. You think because I’ve listed only one example that my opinion isn’t valid. It’s well-known that Fe-users expect perfectionism from others in terms of social appropriateness.  I don’t appreciate your condescending tone, furthermore, because it illustrates my point. Isfjs tend to be stubborn in the face of any sort of view that differs from theirs (in terms of how open someone is). 
26	ISFJ Knowing your inner core	Do you have someone in your life who really knows who you are?\n\nIf not is it something you crave at times? \n\nThere is a conversation that has stayed with me eversince. One night a dear ISFJ confessed that in fact no one truly knew him and that carrying a mask has made him wish to pack a bag and disappear. He said that if people knew his true self, they'd be surprised of how different it is.\n\nBesides it pains him greatly that he can't ask certain questions. He had a deep connection with his grandfather who passed away a couple of years ago. His talkative and tender grandma would be  happy about any conversation but there is a blockage.\n\nDo these problems sound familar? \n\nThank you for reading :)\n
15	Oof, that hits home hard.\n\nOkay this is going to be a long post but, it I feel there a lot of different parts that really connect and I could go deeper but this is just a general feeling of it.\n\nI can speak for my experience though I don’t know if all ISFJ’s feel like this. But, I know that feeling. \n\nI honestly don’t know where to start but, when you’ve worn a mask for so long, and the people you know and come to expect that mask, it’s hard to take it off and be yourself. Especially if you don’t act or think they way they want you to or expected. Extra points if they’re more so harsh and reject it hard. \n\nI feel like a lot of people really don’t know the real me and I do wear a mask often enough. Around everybody, even family and friends. It comes to point you feel like you can’t be yourself at all and you really just want to pack up your bags and leave. Go to where no one knows you and you don’t have this image you have to keep up. Just to feel that freedom of starting over and nobody knowing you. I crave that hard. \n\nThis mask doesn’t just show up. It comes from a lot of areas. There’s the social pressure of trying to be a good upstanding citizen, the internal expectation to try and be this perfect individual and do no wrong, and then there’s the expectation or/and obligation of your friends and family around you that you must be this certain way. It happens as you grow when your “good” side is praised by others more and then rejected/scolded if your “bad” side shows and it sticks with you. I’m no good with rejection so it hits home harder to try and be this person that’s expected, even though it’s not always truly me. \n\nI also think that the mask isn’t fake entirely and we’re not showing our “true” self, rather were not showing our entire self. The darker and more risky side. The more humanistic and imperfect that we know is there. \n\nA lot of my friends and family often tell me I’m nice, kind, smart, and friendly. I have no malicious intent with my actions and I’m always trying to do the best that I can.  That side of me is true. I am that but, that’s not all of me. \n\nI’m not perfect and I get mad, sad, angry, depressed, stubborn, anxious and so much more but, I have a hard time showing those sides because they get rejected or people don’t like acknowledging that I’m imperfect too. \nIt not just feelings, it’s future plans or little wants that you want for yourself. \nBut often enough when you try and show what’s passed the mask that’s people expect, they don’t want to see it. Go back to who you “are”.  I know who I am and question a lot about myself but, I’m not entirely the person they describe at all. \n\nI remember a classmate surprised that I was skipping a school day for no reason. I value school but, I don’t like my time wasted when nothing was going to happen that day. She just didn’t ‘expect’ me to be that ‘kind of person’. I seemed more like a ‘good straight edge student’. \n\nOr last night I talked to my mom about my possible wedding in the future and that I wanted to get eloped at the court house and thrift/alter my wedding dress (I’ve thought about this for awhile), she laughed at my idea of it and cut off the conversation right there and told me to keep thinking about it and that I’ll change my mind. \n\nTwo different things I know but when your constantly told or rejected about being you or doing something that you want, it’s extremely hard and tiring to wear that mask all the time. \n\nAlso the reason why I’m planning on moving to Germany because I feel like I can’t psychically stay where I am because of that damn mask and expectations. The more the months go on the more the feeling to go gets stronger.  I just want to pack, leave, and never go back. There, I get the chance at being truly me. \n\nYour ISFJ friend must be trusting of you to share that side of them. It’s hard sharing that side because we try to be this perfect person when we know that we’re not. Please don’t reject or freak out when we say certain things that you don’t expect because it’s hard wearing that mask all the time and sometimes you just can’t stand it any longer. Plus, it helps us relax and feel like we can be ourselves. I’m working on that myself. Besides, sometimes that other part of ISFJ’s are a hell of a lot more fun and surprising then you could expect ;)\n\nSorry for the long post but I’m a rambler and it takes time for me to really think through my thoughts and get it all down. \nI hope this helps!
2	I feel similarly. I feel I have many faces for all the people in my life, I imagine an expression of Fe. I’m so worried about perceptions and pleasing people, that I feel I don’t get a chance to really be “me” and I have to hide. It’s hard to explain. This, I suppose, is where Fe is found to be superficial and inauthentic. I would say the person who probably knows me most is my Entp boyfriend. But even then, I feel sometimes he sees the idea of me more than me- but is that most people? But he’s the only person I feel I can be myself around, and he appreciates every little piece of me. Which just reminded me of this incredible song. You’re welcome. ;) https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6g3pEw8uU
2	I strangely relate to this. People have expectations of me and I'm trying or not to uphold them. Multiple masks. Different piece of you with different people. Nobody has seen the whole thing. Last day one dude got surprised because I told him that yes I actually failed an exam. He looked shocked.

2	I don't even know who I truly am. Lol\n\nBut am 100&#37; with you. The people who I love unconditionally, whether it be friend or family member, I am SO much at ease. My ISFJ guarding disappears into a very lively, happy, bubbly person. I am carried away by the conversation and am not purposefully trying to make the interaction go somewhere. That's how I wish it was most of the time :(
2	We all have different faces we allow others to see and based on them is how they perceive who we are. Contextually this is appropriate circumstantially, as in professional vs personal relationships. And, typically, ISFJ's accept others more willingly than we expect to be accepted. 
1	The reasons for wearing masks are numerous and it shows in your replies. Again thank you for sharing. Without wanting to steer away too much from ISFJ I have found something interesting  about wearing masks in relationships. \n\n> While we all have public faces—versions of ourselves edited for public consumption—the **fearful-avoidant** have commonly developed a *false self,* an acceptable outer personality which inhibits spontaneous display of their innermost thoughts and feelings even in intimacy. Those who think of themselves as their friends will often be surprised and hurt when high stress brings out the true personality of the masked one. By hiding their true selves, such people live with a social support network that has been attracted by their fake persona, so that when a crisis occurs, those who might have cared for them aren’t around, and those who are around don’t care for the real person revealed by the crisis. In a quotation commonly misattributed to Dr. Seuss, “Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don’t matter and those who matter don’t mind.” Real intimacy and loyalty are founded on honesty, and pretending to be someone you aren’t—keeping up appearances—leaves you with no lasting close friends or partners. \n\n[https://jebkinnison.com/bad-boyfriends-the-book/fearful-avoidant/](https://jebkinnison.com/bad-boyfriends-the-book/fearful-avoidant/)\n\nThe subject is such a multilayered one and this is just a small aspect, but nonetheless interesting.
16	Do you need a long time to process information?	My mother is an ISFJ. Sometimes, in the middle of a conversation, she'll just stop talking. I ask her why, and she says she's thinking. \n\nBut these pauses are more than just one or two seconds. They're much longer than I expect a "just thinking" pause to take—to me, it feels like she's just shut down the conversation without warning.\n\nDo you have a hard time thinking on your feet? Do you need more time to process information or answer questions than, say, an ENTP might?\n\nI know my mom feels like I put too much pressure on her to answer quickly. However, when she just STOPS talking in the middle of a conversation without even saying, "Hm, let me think about that," I get kind of frustrated. Please help me out here, ISFJs! :)
13	In short, yes. For me, it's because I like to think about a situation from different angles/perspectives. I often play devil's advocate and want to understand all sides. Sure, there's a gut answer, but I want to be empathetic and thoughtful about responses. \n\nMy SO is an extravert and had definitely pointed out that I sometimes trail off or stop talking in the middle of a conversation. I don't do it on purpose, it just happens. \n\nCase and point, I put my phone down in the middle of writing this to fold laundry and think about what I'd already written and whether or not it would be a helpful response. \n
6	Definitely have blank out moments. Then I have the post discussion “I should have said this or asked that etc” The blank out is trying to interpret along with recall any relevant information or experience. Risk calculation and current mood/state of mind play into it as well. Really like having my thoughts ahead of time jotted down or memorized. Really works out when my pre-engagement thoughts on how things will work out end up going that way. \n\nI also think while talking and listening on how that person or the environment we are in is affecting the conversation. Kind of weird thinking about it now. Thanks for the reflection moment.
2	I can totally relate to processing information during a conversation. I will start processing and stop listening for just a few seconds. For me it is double processing because English is also not my first language. Many times I need to truly understand and the context of what is being said.\n\nSometimes I even need to process how I feel about situations that happen at work or with my SO when I get home. But for me it goes at step further as I like people to listen and not necessarily provide an opinion. I need to understand how certain behaviors affect me directly. It is part of knowing ME and be a good person when people need your advice/opinion.\n\nHowever, it is weird because I do very well when I am put on situations at work where I need to think on my feet. I also do my best work when I’m under pressure.\n
1	I don't really do what your mom does unless it's an emotional conversation, like a fight with an SO. Then I have to process whatever they said to me and think hard before I say anything back because I want to a) make sure I get across what I truly mean and b) not offend them or sometimes c) I'm too emotional to get the words out without crying. 
1	It's not that I have a hard time thinking on my feet, quite the opposite actually.  I tend to be ruminating over so many different possibilities (Ne) but internally (Ti) so people don't see it and we don't tend to shout out everything we're thinking as we know it might change in future.  For example, I could be thinking the most negative, emotional shit and I know I can't act on that or talk about it until I'm in a better frame of mind and have had time to think it through "logically".
15	It’s you, it’s always been you..	You might not have been my first love, \nbut you were the love that made all the other loves irrelevant\n\n\n
5	Go get them.
2	Probably an ISFJ but could be in a Si-Ti loop.	Hello! :)\nI'm really into this MBTI stuff and I had a lot of research about it (cognitive functions, even socioncs, enneagram, Big5 etc.) but still I'm not 100% sure about my type. What made me think that I'm an ISFJ is that I definitely recognise Si  and Fe in my function stack. I easely notice things that changed, I'm very aware of my phisical state (how can people forget to eat? :D), I like to collect things that remind of a pleasant or important event (like cinema tickets, the armband from when I was in hospital, and even candy papers :D), I have a lot of small routines (some times I'm sick of them, but if I don't go by them, I'm really guilty about it). So I think that's my Si. \nI think my Fe is not very much developed. What motivates me in my behavior toward others is to prevent them being angry with me. I very sensitive about someones negative feelings for me (when I notice this, I always freeze and don't know how to treat the person and the situation). So I really like to make people laugh, I often shock them with my weird,crazy, sometimes cruel,dark and inapropiet humor, but I always stop when I notice that someone is hurting.\nI also think that I use Ti sometimes. I love to pinpoint logical inconsistency in theories, some of my friends call me critical. I love learning new concepts, I enjoy debating about scientific or philosolhical topics for hours.  I'm a sceptical and sarcastic person, very pessimistic about myself, but optimistic about others.\nWhat made me doubt that I'm an ISFJ is that I loooove living in my mind. I've created multiple worlds in my head. I spend a lot of time daydreaming aboug myself in different situations (where I have superpowers, or maybe I have to be saved, or I'm a crazy villain), and I also love to create new ,,movies " in my head with already exisisting characters but  with different stories. I can entertain myself like this for hours. Is this Ne or Ni? Or maybe this doesn't do anything with cognitive functions\n\n\nSo, what do you think? Am I an ISFJ? Others have told me that I could be an INFJ,but I doubt it, I don't really understand how Ni works, no matter how much I read about it, and it's so rare too, I don't want to be one of the mistyped INFJs.\nI've also tested INTP, INFP, ISFP, ISTJ, INTJ, but I start to doubt the accuracy of the tests. \n\nFeel free to ask. :) 
4	INFP maybe?
1	I agree with you. Couldn't push it further on those functions.\n\nI suggest you approach it through the role function, it may help:\nhttp://leontsao.com/2017/02/03/428/\n\nHow old are you? You seem to have developed your third and fourth function, regardless of which they are \n\nHow do you feel about Te in general? Efficiency, acquiring knowledge from books?\n\nAre you sure you are an introvert? What makes you say that?

5	Why are yall so confusing??? Enfp/isfj	I have been friends with this one guy for a while and just last week we confirmed we liked each other and have now been talking. Ever since that day its almost like he fell off the face of the earth. He works quite a bit, so I understand that but even when he worked this much before he still had time to text me and even hang out but now he suddenly doesn't???? I'm so confused. He's only sent like 2 texts every like 15 hours all week. \n\nI'm just so confused. Is this normal for you guys???? Or?? 
9	Work stress has a huge impact on how I relate to acquaintances, friends, and family. Stress takes up all my energy, and leaves nothing for socializing. \n\nAcquaintances/unsteady friendships: when I’m stressed, I do my best to end conversations/avoid acquaintances. No energy for that. Same with friendships where I have to maintain a face, perform a role in those people’s life- they expect a lot of effort from me. \n\nGood friends: I tell them I’m going to vanish for weeks because of stress. \n\nFamily/friends who are like family: I vent to them throughout times of stress. \n\nI suspect a burgeoning relationship makes your relationship difficult to perform for your isfj, so they may be avoiding it for self preservation. Good friends > unsteady friends.\n\nOr he could be trying to ghost you :( I don’t know him- only myself as a pretty polar isfj. 
3	Hey OP, I believe I'm going through something similar. I'm currently seeing an ISFJ whom we mutually agreed to give things a try last month. She's been really busy lately and I haven't been hearing much from her, but when we do talk over the phone I couldn't sense disinterest. Maybe it's just how they function?\n\nI'm not sure if they are the work first, play later type, but it's kind of rubbing off that way to me. Perhaps an actual ISFJ could shed some light for us. (Am an ISTJ)
2	Did he ignore you this often as friends?   \n\n\nPerhaps I'm not the best ISFJ at giving advice, but I myself would make time to talk to someone if I truly liked them. There is no excuse for "2 texts every 15 hours all week" without a good reason. Confront him about it.
1	I don’t know but I am an ISFJ, and while work day might have been stressful, I always find time to reply to TEXTS. I do this at least within 1-2hrs or at the end of the day the latest. I treat emails as “when you have time to respond”. I care too much about making the other person feel like he/she doesn’t matter...
3	How can I develop my inferior Si	
3	Listen to your heart\n\n\nListen to the beat\n\n\nListen to the rhythm, the rhythm of the street\n\n\nIs shitposting allowed on /r/isfj?\n\nAnyway, that song came to mind because in my opinion, it is a really internal, feelings-based way of being in tune with your surroundings. (not exactly though lol) \n\nI would recommend doing something and really thinking about how it makes you feel- your internal impression of the experience. The six senses sure- but your emotional response as well. Then, think about how you might have felt something similar in the past, and what is the same between those two feelings. especially if the emotional response is the same, but the situation rather different. 
2	Start noticing the tiny details and facts in your environment and then try and compare it against something you have experienced before. \n\nStart collecting facts about things you are interested. Try not to imagine what could be just try and understand it for what it is.\n\nTake 5 minutes every day to be aware of your physical state and how you feel in detail. 
3	Looking for advice	I’m an INFP and an artist.  I’m looking for ways to stabilize and organize my life so that I can move forward.\n\nI’m consistently distracted by my inner world as I try to figure out what was meant by things or I try to research ideas that I feel are poorly understood.\n\nMy latest mental invention was to stimulate activity on the Si front by thinking in terms of pursuing stability and the fear of what might happen if I don’t.\n\nThis idea seems to work for me in theory because it speaks to my Fi through my Ne.  Many of you may have already jumped off-board of this idea and have probably judged me to be “overthinking it”. I forgive you for this 🙃.\n\nWhat are some practical, real world applications I can bring to bear upon my life to corral my activities so that they produce the kinds of results the world expects in a timely fashion?
5	Also INFP. Also artist.\n\nScheduling only takes you to a point.\n\nYou have to learn your tendencies and then use them to propel you toward your goals.\n\nFor example, I suck at meal planning, but I’m the meal cooker at our house.\n\nWe eat the same thing on the same days of the week so I can autopilot buying groceries. Monday is spaghetti. Tuesday is tacos, etc. \n\nThose are things you can change for variety, but you don’t make chicken strips on Monday! It’s spaghetti night!\n\nThis allows me to feed the family, stay on budget, and not freak out about making dinner every night.
3	I mean, the problem with this post is that it’s not really asking anything lol. “How can I keep a schedule”? Is that what you want to know? 
23	Show of hands, who thought they were INFJs or INFPs at first?	I truly believe Si sounds like Ni when it comes to bad descriptions and inferior Ne can mimic inferior Se. Also INFPs can seem like judgers due to their function stack and healthy Fi can look like Fe in small groups. \n\nI really truly believed from the bottom of my heart and with loads of research that I was an INFJ. But alas, Earwax. 
10	I'm in the process of coming to terms with the fact that I'm more likely an isfj and not an infj or infp. They all just sound so similar and how am I supposed to monitor my own brain functioning on a regular basis to determine what type I am?
10	Yes, absolutely-- both of these. For a long time, when I first was exploring this, I thought I was an INFP. But after evaluating some of the other similar types and re-testing, I then thought I was INFJ or ISFJ. I'm pretty sure I align most with ISFJs, after looking into the differences.\n\nI don't fully know the exact functions and nuances of each, but the vibe I get is that INFP is like an extreme hippie-ish, creative feeler introvert, who might not have as much logic and is more of an abstract thinker. They just want everyone to get along, man, and they feel what others feel and they feel bad when others don't feel good-- ya feel me?\n\nINFJ seems like a slightly more logical, straightlaced INFP. Maybe slightly less creative, a little more structured.\n\nISFJ seems pretty similar to INFJ, but the main difference that does it for me is that ISFJs rely more on past experiences, are more of a planner, and don't love the idea of endlessly speculating new things/methods to try. \n\nThese are just my impressions, of course. I am not a Myers Briggs guru by any stretch.\n\n
7	Still discovering which among these exact three what I really am. I'm drawing more towards ISFJ but I have tested multiple times as INFJ while socially I seem more like an INFP. Gah.
5	Ha, yes I thought I was an INFJ. I thought I always had a creative side because enjoy looking at nice art and taking pictures, but I ended up realizing that I like photography because of the "capturing the memory" aspect of it. The more sensing thing to do.. \n\n"I remember events as snapshots of what actually happened" (myersbriggs.org).  \n\n\nNow I've come to terms and walk around with a really nice camera and tell people no when they ask if I'm a photographer. There goes my dream of being an artist haha.
4	Yep I typed as an INFJ.  Very rarely INFP but I can see the similarities between INFP and ISFJ (we can be uh.. very sensitive doormats that excuse people's behaviour for them).  I'm happy sticking to ISFJ and I honestly can't see any other viable type for me.  I think the issue is INFJ being described as being able to easily read people - ISFJs are well-equipped at doing that too - they use their Si to see something isn't right with the person and IxFJ know how to cheer people up in different ways.
4	I was told I was a infp for a long time. I didn't quite feel like I was. Finally took the test again years later. Came back ISFJ.
3	Kept getting INFP every time I took the test. Some folks kept typing me as an ENFP at first.\n\nI actually strongly believe lots of SFJs are mistyped as NFPs, and same with STJ\-\> NTP. This is why I take it with a grain of salt whenever someone tries to boldly claim they are an NP of some sort. I watch them closely, waiting for them to prove it before I mentally call bullshit.
1	I have gotten infj on every test I have taken over the past 16 years. Literally yesterday I read a thing about isfj mistyping as infj and it clicked. But now I'm super confused about what Ni actually is, if my Si is what I thought was Ni all along! 
1	I've tested as INFJ and ISFJ on official MBTI. I think the latter is more fitting because I prefer concrete ideas and steps over idealistic ones and I like structure over fantasy. But depending on the day..... I could type as either one. I'm an odd duck. 
1	I've tested, relate and cannot relate with all three! \n\nI first tested as INFP and then as a ISFJ because I strongly relate to Fe. I get super confused over Si and Ni.\n\nAll my confusion:\n\n1. I notice when people get their hair cut (Si) but feel like I'm floating through this world (inferior Se) and won't observe a bus even if it's about to hit me.\n2. It really grates on me that Ni is always described as mystic, and usually "right". I find most people, including myself and NJs, usually wrong. The "aha" moment also bugs me. Images, impressions, solutions and ways of doing things just kind of appear but rarely as a explosive thoughts like "hey! idea!" Maybe that's a more accurate descriptions of Ni, or maybe my Ni is faulty, or maybe I'm truly operating in Si. \n3. I definitely think mostly, if not almost completely, in pictures and impressions which screams Si. But, Ni people also think in pictures. For example, I know an INTJ who thinks exclusively in pictures. And pretty sure picture thinking is common among all types in general.\n4. When stressed I need to exercise excessively, and then I really focus on how my body feels in that moment, or eat cheez-its non stop, which suggests in the grip Se for INFJ. But doesn't that suggest Si too? I think Si craves those kind of inwardly bodily sensations.\n5. I don't relate to being in the grip of Ne for ISFJ because I'm okay with and welcome change. \n\nSo /shrugs who knows? I don't. Si and Ni are super weird.
7	What does Si feel like, in your own words?	I'm really curious to know. Apparently a lot of MBTI websites don't do it justice which I don't doubt at all.\n\nX-posted to r/mbti, r/ISTJ, r/ESTJ, r/ESFJ
14	Hehe, I love ranting about Si!\n\nTo me, Si is not so much about the "past" itself (although it's very close to it), but more about the "familiar".\n\nAs high a Si user (and especially Si dominant), I feel most comfortable with things that I am used to. And because of that, I kind of resent "the unknown". I tend to be scared of trying new things or doing something for the first time, because I have no idea how it will go down. I feel like I need to know every single detail on how to do things before I do them, because it might go wrong and might not be perfect on the first try. That's also because of our Ne inferior, obviously. Once we develop Ne, Si can pretty much get used to anything and will build experience in all fields (I sure hope so at least).\n\nSi is not just the "fear of change", though.\n\nSi works with personal associations, because it is an introverted function. For instance : if I'm walking in the woods, I see the sunlight streaming through the leaves and it makes me happy because it reminds me of how warm it feels to have the sunlight on you, and then, by association, it reminds me of times when I felt warm and happy.\n\nOf course it does also work with bad memories, ahah. Because of that, I sometimes get triggered by things that remind me of a bad time I had. I might also avoid doing anything that will get me in this situation again, and will go to great length to do that, because Si is also about learning from past experiences (to feel at ease \- most of the time we love stability and for things to be simple). For instance : I was in a really unhealthy friendship. Because of that, it's hard to interact with things that remind me of that person (places, songs, etc.) and I feel like I have to reclaim it. (It might also be why types with Si ter have such a hard time with their loops?)\n\nWhich brings me to something I believe has to do with Si (and I'm curious about other Si doms' experience on it): I associate some people with really specific scenery or things. One of my INTP friends, for instance, I associate with this image (beware it's going to sound a bit stupid to many people ahah): 6pm evenings that get dark enough that it's almost impossible to distinguish sky and land, but you can still make out what is happening, and when you look out the window and into the city, everything is blue except for the windows that are glowing from the lit rooms of the buildings. I think I associate them because my friend and that time of the day give me the same exact feeling of tranquility (hence the subjective, introverted sensing, I guess).\n\nI hope this helps! Amazing username btw ahahah
3	I read it much better described in this one article I can’t find, but here’s the cliffnotes for the experiential aspects of Si (as opposed to the tendencies Si-doms manifest).\n\nA month ago: I read a book. The Beatles Yellow submarine was playing in the background. I was in the train, feeling a bit uncomfortable because the tag on my shirt was scratchy, and I was worried about an assignment. \n\n\nToday, with normal amounts of Si: I read a quote from that book, and remember being on the train listening to the Beatles. \n\nToday, with a high amount of Si (happens when I’m stressed or depressed): I read a quote from that book, and I feel exactly how I felt on that day I read the quote. Stress, tag, Beatles, train. It’s the internal impression of the exterior. \n\n\nThese impressions are how I interact with the exterior world. I saw this grossly puffy piece of pizza last night and it gave me an impression. I was immediately reminded of a similar impression something had made on me. I thought: It looks like an old acquaintance from highschool who’s put on weight. I remember looking at them, and thinkjng, hey why are you so puffy all of the sudden? I don’t remember you like this. Like the pizza. 
24	It's sad how there are so many isfj and yet no one is talking about us	So many people are following infj or infp, most of them just took a personality test got infj searched it up and found some similarities.I was the same, still I doubted that I actually am the rarest type, so for several days I kept researching this.So many times I saw isfj but somehow ignored it, but than I actually read about it and realized that I am one, everything was corect.Unlike with infj or infp where I had few similarities.I know it's not like every person with this type is exactly the same.But still there is an easy way to find people that are similar with you and you can find out more things about yourself.I always had a hard time finding out who I actually am I thought there was something wrong with me so I just tried to be what others wanted.So I feel good to have something that I can call me.At first I was pretty sad when I found out that I'm isfj, I had so many similaties with the popular ones so I kind of had my hopes up that I am one of them.But now I am alright with what I am.\nSorry if I made any mistake I'm not too good at english.

4	I wish I had more ISFJs in my life. They are supportive no matter what. I tend to be shy and quiet, but I feel I can speak with one of you without being judged :)
2	Ray795 if being with a ISFJ has taught me one thing, it is that they are being   misunderstood. An ISFJ might feel quite isolated without knowing about his type and realization that there are many people out there that function similarly.\n\nI needed a manual in order to understand ISFJs and I'm not proud of my many blind spots. ISFJs that have opened up about  personal experiences have helped a great deal without even knowing it.\n\nThere is a lot of harm being done due to miscommunication and with the necessary information at hand, it could be avoided.\n\nThey are great people.
1	what are some of these bad stereotypes of ISFJ? 
10	Sense of Belonging	Explain to me yours. \n\n\nMy sense of belonging can be summed up {similarly} in Edgar Allen Poes poem: \n\n\nFrom childhood’s hour I have not been \n\n\nAs others were—I have not seen \n\n\nAs others saw—I could not bring \n\n\nMy passions from a common spring— \n\n\nFrom the same source I have not taken \n\n\nMy sorrow—I could not awaken \n\n\nMy heart to joy at the same tone— \n\n\nAnd all I lov’d—I lov’d alone— \n\n\nThen—in my childhood—in the dawn \n\n\nOf a most stormy life—was drawn \n\n\nFrom ev’ry depth of good and ill \n\n\nThe mystery which binds me still— \n\n\nFrom the torrent, or the fountain— \n\n\nFrom the red cliff of the mountain— \n\n\nFrom the sun that ’round me roll’d \n\n\nIn its autumn tint of gold— \n\n\nFrom the lightning in the sky \n\n\nAs it pass’d me flying by— \n\n\nFrom the thunder, and the storm— \n\n\nAnd the cloud that took the form \n\n\n(When the rest of Heaven was blue) \n\n\nOf a demon in my view—

2	Need help understanding ISFJ(M) friend as an INTJ (F)	Hello! \nI am seeking advice/ clarification on ISFJ behavior. We have been friends for a year now, met at work, and shared romantic interest which faded away for a few months when I stopped working as much because of school responsibilities. Now that I am working more again we see each other more. \nI am confused about ISFJs and their typical love language/ signals. Ever since we met we felt comfortable sitting close to each other and joking around. He would stare at me a lot when he thought I wasn’t paying attention, so much that other coworkers would tell me that he obviously liked me. \n\nHowever, I have been very direct with my advances which has brought him more confidence to compliment me more bluntly BUT he doesn’t admit that he likes me. \nAll of my coworkers say how he gets “stuck” around me and I’m the only person he asks for help or hugs/ seeks affection from. \n\nI don’t understand! He’s terrible at texting so I assume he’s not interested so when I stop giving him my attention he seems butt hurt. I don’t understand, I feel I put way too much effort into initiating. Any ISFJ insight would be useful, dunno if ISFJs are really that shy or if I should just give up and poor my energy elsewhere. \n\nI’m also a very emotionally intelligent INTJ, in the sense that I’m not insensitive or purely logical and care about what others are feeling. He’s very logical to the point that he acts more ISTJ-ish but he keeps testing as an ISFJ. \n\nUpdate 1: I decided to be very direct and explicitly ask him out on a date! No confession of feelings yet. \n\nUpdate 2: ISFJ is much more confident and blunt about planning our first date. We are going to the Zoo. 
6	A) tests aren’t the most reliable way of determining MBTI type\n\nB) Hard to say. I know as an ISFJ I personally would be very hesitant to tell someone I liked them if I wasn’t very sure the friendship would survive it. I have a lot of trouble figuring out if someone could possibly like me and I tend to end up telling myself “it’s all in your head, don’t embarrass yourself,” so unless you’re very sure he knows how you feel, like, you’ve told him directly, I wouldn’t just assume he’s picking up on your signals. I’m willing to initiate things, but I need to feel a certain level of comfort/safety before I will, so it might be that he still feels insecure and is afraid to actually make a move. 
3	It's nice to know other INTJs are having the same issue. You say that you've been direct with your advances, but how direct? Have you unambiguously told him how you feel?
2	Dated isfj before, isfj Male excels in texting! Loads of messages every day. As an INTJ, I’d recommend you not to be emotional invested at the start. Honestly I never initiate chats/talks/meetups with mâles unless he’s my family or colleagues or ppl I have to contact in order to get practical things done. 
3	ISFJ and favourite tv shows	Hi! :\)\n\nMy sociological mind started ponderng why people watch the shows they watch on tv/streaming \(specifically reality\) and I was wondering \- do my fellow ISFJ peeps like reality tv? And what genre of tv do you enjoy the most :\)\n\n\(Personally **not** a fan of reality, love comedy and dramedy with a healthy inclusion of ABC Australia :\)\)
5	[deleted]
5	I like dramas. At the moment, I'm watching Westworld and Terrace House(Japanese reality show on Netflix, great if you like observing relationships between ppl which I do).
5	Sitcoms. Brooklyn 99, HIMYM, Seinfeld, Friends, you name it.
3	Eureka! It’s campy, sweet, and it feels like most characters are genuinely good people. It makes me so happy, like soul balm. Be forewarned, though. It definitely takes a few episodes to hit its stride. \n\nI don’t like reality. Unless it’s nice, like Great British Baking show. 
2	The only reality show I watch is Top Chef. I like the same type of shows as my INTP husband. 
2	I like cooking competition shows and HGTV. I really like true crime documentaries, too. Otherwise I pretty much watch comedies.
1	I really dislike reality tv. I will say I did enjoy fear factor when I was younger if that counts. \nMy favorite shows are Game of Thrones and South Park
1	Yeah. ABC on Wednesday, ( and 702 in the car) , buffy, ( watching it now, and some sci-fi but not endless episodic shit).  So happy!, lost in space ,  but not killjoys or the expanse.  Firstly season of a lot of stuff, not so much second. \n\nNo reality, cooking, sports
1	I can't stand reality tv but this may be because I used to transcribe for several popular (terrible) shows in the early 2000s.. I feel like I should be getting paid $14/hr if I watch anything reality. >_<\n\nI'm into comedy and drama for the most part. Right now I'm watching the Handmaid's Tale, Barry, Bob's Burgers.. 
1	It's always sunny in Philadelphia 
1	The Office, HIMYM is a classic, The Big Bang Theory, Blackish, New Girl, and South Park. I’m in to most sitcom shows. I also like Orange is the New Black and 13 Reasons Why. I also love watching NFL and NBA. 
6	Big 5 correlations with ISFJs?	Just curious how many have taken the Big 5 test to compare and what your numbers looked like. I took the one at: [http://personalitylab.org/tests/bfi2\_self\_pol.htm](http://personalitylab.org/tests/bfi2_self_pol.htm)\n\nExtraversion \- 29\n\nAgreeableness \- 79\n\nConscientiousness \- 92\n\nNegative Emotionality \- 44\n\nOpen\-Mindedness \- 56\n\nfor the longest time I thought I was INTJ until I retook a few tests which placed me here as ISFJ. I'm a male in my late 20s in case anyone cared.\n\nCheers! 
2	my isfj hubby had tested as istj in college but he's retaken the test & we realized that he is an isfj
2	It's interesting because openness to experience is highly correlated with iNtuition, to the point where they're probably the same construct. Obviously it's not as simple as 0\-100 with 49 being a sensor and 51 being intuitive, but I'd love to see a true comparison between sensors and intuitives and their openness scores!\n\nI'm an INTJ and my scores were:\n\nExtraversion: 56\n\nAgreeableness: 62\n\nConscientiousness: 73\n\nNegative emotionality: 65\n\nOpen\-mindedness: 81
2	Male, early 20s, ISFJ\n\nExtraversion - 17\n\nAgreeableness - 79\n\nConscientiousness - 69\n\nNegative Emotionality - 56\n\nOpen-Mindedness - 60\n\nFunnily enough I also thought I was INTJ for the longest time.
1	Never heard of this test but I decided to take it. I connect mostly with the ISFJ description and that is what I have tested to be twice before. Early 20's. \n\nExtraversion \- 54\n\nAgreeableness \- 73\n\nConscientiousness \- 69\n\nNegative Emotionality \- 40\n\nOpen\-Mindedness \- 79
16	Why does it feel so hard to be taken seriously and listened to?	It seems like if anyone else says something, they don't get questioned too much. But if I say something, such as "I don't want to go out tonight", I get talked down repeatedly until I either give in, or try justify myself, at which point the person gets defensive and says that "you just had to say no, no need to get so emotional" (which is infuriating because I literally did say no, several times). \n\nDoes anyone else struggle with this? 
6	Yes, this has happened to me too. It’s a terrible feeling. I also struggle with wanting so badly to be carefree and super easy going all the time, while also wanting desperately to be taken seriously by everyone...haha
5	I have those issues sometimes, too. Maybe because we hate letting others down and they know that
3	I don't think you specifically aren't being taken seriously (in this case at least)\n\nFor some reason it's common sense that everybody wants and needs to go out (that's totally crazy). So if you say you don't want to, people will try to talk you into it. And there is little boundary to that.\n\nJust be very definitive right away, or even pretend to be upset. I do it, that way I don't have to actually get upset for people to understand and it's smoother (because I'm not actually upset)
2	In my opinion, you should confront the person and tell them directly that you did say no, they will admit their mistake. 
3	Are ISFJs and ESTPs a good romantic match?	I'm an ESTP. The only women I have ever clicked with on a very deep romantic level have been two women who had the ISFJ personality. I could even see myself marrying one of them but distance and/or relocation got in the way for both scenarios (plus I was younger then too). I don't know much about MBTI so I was wondering if the ISFJ and ESTP match is a good one romantically. Why or why not?
3	http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ISFJ_rel.html\nThat site says they are natural partners. \n\nMy personal opinion I think the ISFJ and ESTP have a lot to offer each other. I think the big question is is the ESTP ready to settle down. Cause ISFJs tend to take their relationships seriously. On our part we need to learn to relax the J a bit and the ESTP can help with that. The ISFJ could also introduce some structure in the ESTPs life. We also share the same judging functions (Fe and Ti) just flipped between auxiliary and teritary. So the ESTP can help the ISFJs Ti and the ISFJ can help the ESTPs Fe. 
2	Most websites say ISFJ and ESTP are made for each other.. I admire an ESTP man, but he doesn't even know I exist. No personal experience, but here you go -\n\nhttps://www.personality-central.com/ISFJ-ESTP.html
2	It’s funny that you ask that as, as an ISFJ myself i’m always drawn to ESTP’s myself (got a mad crush on this ESTP in my school)
2	They are in "mirage" relations in socionics, which is one of the better relationships types: [**ISFJ relationships**](http://www.personalitycafe.com/isfj-articles/285-love-types-isfj-5.html#post4235430) & [**ESTP relationships**](http://personalitycafe.com/estp-articles/289-love-types-estp-5.html#post10023554).    \n  Mirage aka illusionary relations are sometimes described as relations of psychological relaxation, which sometimes is too much. Mirage types find it easy to spend time together and enjoy each other's company, but on the down side they don't take each other very seriously and have trouble completing tasks together.  \n         \nMirage type is very similar to dual type, which is ENTP for ISFJ and INFJ for ESTP, thus mirages are very commonly attracted to each other.
2	My first ex was an ESTP - I loved how he took me out of my comfort zone without forcing me into doing anything or making me feel boring or bad if I didn't.  I felt safe with him and he would keep me close-by, he wouldn't pretend he didn't know me or didn't like me like some young guys do, he made it clear to his friends and other girls that we were together but still let me be me and have my freedom - protective, not controlling!  He was a really popular, funny guy but we broke up because his "recreational" drug use was becoming more of a habit (he wasn't dealing well with some issues in his life) and he sadly passed away (non-drug related) a few years ago, 
29	I didn’t leave you because I stopped loving you, I left you because the more I stayed the more I stopped loving myself	
30	As much as I enjoy being in relationships, I ultimately find myself liking who I am more when I am single. I tend to make too many concessions to see my partner happy, and I lose sight of who I am in the process. 
11	Sometimes I wonder if I’m doing too much for my partners and have to remind myself to take care of me, too. But I’m working on it, and I’m also finally being pushed to be more assertive and outspoken in my relationship (which is usually really tough for me), so that’s cool 
3	It has never happened to me.. but yes, I am kind of self-destructive, drain myself out for people I love, so much so my physical health also went down.
-2	In other words, you're a selfish jerk?
6	ISFJ's: Who's your favorite character from Lord of the Rings?	Also, please note if you're referring to the book character or the movie character, since they differ somewhat :)
4	I’ve only seen the movies but I.... well I was gonna say Sam, and I do love him, but actually Gimli is probably my fav. The gruff character with the heart of gold is a trope I’m a sucker for, and he’s hilarious. 
3	Sam for sure.
1	Haven’t read the books yet, but I finally finished the trilogy with friends last week! Sam is definitely my favourite, because I feel like I can relate to his dependability for friends. On the other hand, Aragorn though is quite the looker...
1	When I first saw the movies as a preteen, Arwen and Frodo were my favorite characters. As I've become older, I appreciate Aragorn more. I'd say it's about the same for the books, except of course Arwen only really exists as a footnote in the trilogy.
1	I am referring to the movie characters.\n\nTorn between Aaragorn, Legolas and Gandalf.
15	ISFJ going through an existential/quarter life crisis. Or am I just being a normal ISFJ?	Hi friends! I am an unwavering ISFJ, and have been struggling lately with my purpose on this earth, why any of us are here, etc. I’ve seen a couple posts on this sub about this topic, but I want to take it a step further. \n\nThe part I’m struggling with most is how I spend my time. I’m a recently graduated 24yo F, and I just got my first job post-grad school in an amazing research lab (immunology) at one of the best universities in the world. I am so lucky to have this opportunity, and I still pinch myself sometimes that I’m here, but I find my self feeling *so* often that I’m not doing what I love or what I’m passionate about. This job is mentally exhausting, so by the time I’m done with work, I have little motivation to be social, explore hobbies, etc. I feel that I am constantly being emptied and don’t know how to fill myself back up.\n\nI’m also so interested in understanding myself, understanding why we’re here, how to navigate life. So my mind automatically goes to “I should go back to school to be a therapist” (many people say that I am like an armchair therapist). While part of me thinks that would be an amazing career for me and it could be my “passion”, another big part thinks that I’m just running away from this life that I have now, and am hoping for happiness in the next stage. That the grass will be greener if I have a different job. Logically, I know this is probably not true, but it’s still an internal struggle nevertheless.\n\nHave any of you ISFJs felt similarly? Like you’re stuck in the future, and have trouble being satisfied in the *now*? Or that you feel that something is missing, and a passionate career is the way that you *should* feel most fulfilled? I’m curious if anyone can relate.\n\nEdit: age. Fat fingers.
4	I'm almost in the same place! I'm a recent grad at the same age with an awesome job that I love... but it also wears me to the ground and has me thinking about the next step(s) in life. I think as ISFJs we're planners, naturally, and now when you have everything set up, you're looking for the next thing to do. Maybe instead of trying to reboot your career, you try making a smaller long-term goal?\n\nFor me, this is travel. I've been trying to go somewhere every year and the process of saving up money, planning my vacation, coordinating the details, and actually going on the trip keeps me from trying to over-fix other aspects of my life.\n\nAlso remember: you career doesn't have to be you life's passion. Your career should facilitate your passions--sometimes this means, yes, you're working in you dream job, but for a lot of people, this means having steady work with steady income that lets them go out and find passions outside what supports them.
3	Stick with the immunology position for a while it sounds amazing! You can always go back to school to become a therapist in a few years if you decide lab research isn't for you. 
2	I have no advice but I totally relate (19 M). I recently went back to school because I don't want to be stuck in jobs I hate for the rest of my life, so I decided to try to get a basic high school diploma in IT. I feel like I'm completely wasting my time because, just like you, I also want to explore a bunch of other things and learn more about my passions but every day after coming back from school I'm just too tired to do anything other than browsing reddit and chatting. Even when I have free time I tell myself how cool it would be to learn about something but I'm just so lazy that I often end up doing nothing. That could just be a problem of organization because there are so many things that I might feel overwhelmed and never actually get myself to look into them. I usually try to do things that will help me with my life in the future but I helplessly feel like I'm unable to enjoy the present. Maybe I'm just focusing so much on my future that I've been missing out on having fun.
2	I can relate. I think I totally chose the wrong career and pretty much just accept my demanding and stressful job. However, the jobs pays well and considering I’m in my early 40s, I think the money I make and save will help me long term finance my passions.
1	I am very future-oriented, so I’ve had similar feelings through a lot of my life. I’m not a particularly happy person so I’m always trying to think of what I can do now that will make things better in the future. \n\nI spent a lot of time in a job that wasn’t fulfilling because I knew I had a good shot at being promoted, which would improve my prospects when I changed careers. I’m working in my field now and still not sure if what I want to be doing long term, so I’m just trying to identify opportunities for growth to give myself options. \n\nI’ve been trying to be more open to trying new things, because you never know what might really strike a cord with you. 
1	I relate to that too. When I finished my degree and after several familiar/personal struggles I was exhausted and without a clear idea of  what to do with my life. I had always wanted to be a veterinarian but after finishing university I realized I didn't felt passionate about the job and wanted to do something more meaningful to me. After 6 months of apathy closed in my bedroom, I decided to switch careers. I didn't studied a whole degree again (could not imagine to do that for 4 years more), but enroled a biomedical research master (only 1 year) and started working in an oncology lab. \nI am loving the experience so far. But I totally understand thatis overbearing the amount of time we put in this work, the stress to get funding/good results and not screw up the experiments,etc.I think is not the perfect environment for a ISFJ because of the high stress, but I also consider we are gifted for this kind of job, where attention to details and perseverance is really important. What helped to me is that I have a very good relationship with my supervisor, and after months of hard job and taking homework home every weekend, I had a talk with him where I told him I couldn't keep this rythm because I had no time for all the tasks assigned to me, and my personal life was suffering. Luckily he understood...if not, I would jave reconsidered my career. \nIf you like your current job and you think you are overloaded with work, maybe try to calmly talk with your boss/supervisor... But if the situation doesn't change and you feel like shit everyday, maybe is better to change paths. \n
1	Thank you so much for posting about this! \nI am going through something similar, I just finished my MPH, have a pretty good data analyst job, but am feeling the same way, thinking I should have explored becoming a nurse more.   It might be helpful to remember that being a clinician or clinical person in any sense while maybe less exhausting in a TI-sense, they can also be super stressful and exhausting, but for even more hours per week than a research job. 
38	Angels	I’ve found ISFJs to be the angels of the world. \n\nThank you for existing. 
12	I needed this today, thank you :)
8	finally, something nice for us.. thankyou.. :( what's your MBTI?
8	The one I know made me want to be a better person and actually do something whenever they were talking to me. That's huge coming from me, an INTP. 
3	:)
3	Thank you! 😀
2	right back at you, my dude. Thanks for that
2	I'm actually an elf. But, thanks.
1	Thanks
0	Is this an ISFJ thing?	Is this an inferior Ne, auxiliary Fe, inferior Ti, and/or dominant Si thing? (not the guy's view but the main phenomenon he's talking about) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k82r2OoY9TM
3	Lifestyle analysis for MBTI survey - 3 minutes to fill, will post results in a week. Participate too!!	
16	What's going on lately with people coming here to tell us we are stupid?	Just a random thought... After seeing a couple of posts these last weeks were we are insulted (now we are not only insulted and belittled in the r/mbti, but also in our own subreddit??), Why do we try to reason with them politely if they directly show no respect? can we just ignore this people? Remove the post?
10	I don’t hang out in r/mbti so I can’t really speak to that. I think ISFJs tend to be mostly focused on others, so we’re pretty modest and don’t go around tooting our own horns. Some people might interpret that to mean we don’t have much going on intellectually, but we know better! We just don’t feel the need to brag about it. 
7	Hii haha I'm not an isfj but 2 of the most important people in my life are isfjs (sister and best friend). Both are really smart; they both got into top schools and they're both dean's listers/top students. So yeah I wouldn't overthink it. You know your strengths so just live and let live. 
6	ISFJ are wonderful people. 
3	LOL I think there's more context to that. The title is misleading I know, but if you look at the content, the person actually was asking something else.
3	I’m thinking about checking the r/ISFJ guidelines and removing posts that break the subreddit rules.

21	Missing people from your past	I've always had trouble with missing people from my past once they're no longer a part of my life, and I wonder if this is a theme for other ISFJs, or if it's just me.\n\n\nEven after I form new, meaningful connections, I still sometimes find myself thinking about people I used to know, even if my relationship with them was unhealthy, and I often miss them. \n\n\nI've been in a very healthy, happy, fulfilling relationship for just shy of 2 years now, and while I wouldn't change it at all, I still find myself missing an ex sometimes. \nI've moved on from that relationship, and I definitely wouldn't want to go back to it, but I catch myself wondering how he's doing sometimes, and missing the good times we had. \n\n\nI don't act on these feelings, and I usually just leave the past where it belongs, but sometimes I feel guilty when I'm lying there with this amazing guy who I love to death, and I feel a pang of nostalgia for times I had with an ex. \n\n\nHave any of you guys ever had issues with this? How do you move forward and let go of the attachment to people who aren't a part of your life anymore?
8	I definitely have problems with this. I moved to a new state about a year ago, and I still frequently think about the job I left and all the friends I had there. In fact, I just finished a rewatch of The Office a few minutes ago and found myself bawling during the last episode reminiscing about the good times I had with my coworkers there. \n\nI think as ISFJs we can be so selective about the people we become close to, that those bonds tend to be really hard to sever. It makes sense that they would stay in your heart and mind for a long time even after the relationship ends because they took up so much space there before. 
2	Yes, I can identify with this.\n\nThe other day I was giving a friend a run down of my past toxic relationship and what kind of stunts my ex-gf pulled. I had story after story and then ended the whole thing with "but she is a good person". My friend said: "it certainly doesn't sound like it". I still value good experiences with her but I need to watch my thoughts about idealising it.\n\nI am also about to move away from the city I live in and as soon as I made the decision all the positive things about this place are getting overwhelming. I am basically romanticising everything about it.\n\nI think that it is because of the experience catalogue in our head that we base our decisions and behaviour on. I value positive emotional reasons pretty high while negative memories are dropped as soon as they are over. My brain is trying to find enough facts to makes a decision black or white but that rarely works. So I have to remind myself that there are reasons for decisions and ended relationships even if not everything points that way.
1	I'm like this too. I had a friend back in high school and she was one of the few people who I could be real with and who I felt understood me. We drifted apart in college and I miss our friendship. 
1	Yes, I relate. Apart from closer relationships that are over by now, I hate meeting people that I know will only be "passing by" in my life, and whom I will have to say goodbye eventually. I also feel sad when I think how my current work colleagues will be part of my past in some future point of my life..  
1	ENTP here. A good ISFJ friend of mine whom I love and who confessed to me just some days before graduation will now leave to travel the world and go to uni abroad, while I need to stay and finish my diploma. \nEmotional dilemma aside, reading this topic and the reactions makes me ask myself whether or not this feeling means for you that you wish to stay in contact/ hear from the people you miss, or you wish to have your space? What form of contact would you like? I still have some time to communicate on that but I'd appreciate to hear what the more experienced individuals among you would suggest based on your preferences.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the upfront and quick response. I'm very lucky and happy to hear both that long distance is not too much of a problem and that she is very much willing to stay in contact. (Also made a sarcastic joke about marriage, you guys take sass and make a flirty sport out of it). Enjoy the evening~
0	ISFJ Seeming Stupid to INTPs	I'm curious why ISFJs do some things. I think a lot of the things they do seem stupid to INTPs, because INTPs aren't perceiving things correctly. Why do ISFJs say obvious things (e.g. "You're home!" when a person just entered the doorway)? Why do they pull? Why do they hint that they want you to show appreciation by going on about how hard they've been working?\n\nDo they not think sometimes or does it just seem that way because of the ISFJ I've been around? The ISFJ will do things, but it's like their process is "duty", "I feel they'll like this" but not "Will they like this?" It's like it completely slips their mind that they've told them something regarding what they get the past 500 times.\n\nWhy do they articulate so strangely (this coming from an INTP)? They'll say things like "I'm a Star Wars." or "Pokeman". It seems they'll have trouble articulating abstract thoughts which, in my experience, can come off as "stupid" to the INTP when in reality, it's similar to the INTP's difficulty in articulating and expressing their feelings. What I don't understand is why they word things the way they do. I don't recall noticing any other type do that. "A Star Wars"??? What makes them think that's correct grammar?? This used to annoy me, but I've increased my emotional intelligence and have become much more aware of perspectives and function behavior, so now it just confuses me.
8	Well, I live in a household full of ISFJs, in addition to being one myself. “You’re home!” is more about the tone than the observation itself. If I sound excited, it means, “You’re home! I’m so glad you’re here now!” If it sounds startled/annoyed, I might not have been expecting you and I might be saying it to buy time while I figure out why you’re here and adjust my plans to account for your presence. \n\nHinting for appreciation is a somewhat immature way of getting what we want. We love to be acknowledged and appreciated, but it can feel crass or get bad results to outright say, “hey, I want you to thank me for my effort/show me love/marvel at my hard work/do something in exchange.” So rather than trying to figure out how to navigate that, we hint by expressing how difficult something was or how hard we’ve been working. It can also feel more authentic if someone picks up on hints or expresses their gratitude spontaneously than if you say “hey I want you to say thank you,” and the person goes “uh, okay, thanks.” \n\nDunno what your second paragraph is asking. Please clarify your own grammar if you’re gonna shit on us for ours :P \n\nMy family often jokes around by saying things weirdly or making references to stuff. Sometimes the joke is just, “I said it wrong/in a weird voice,” or sometimes it’s reference to a movie, or (in my case) a podcast/meme/etc where they said something in a certain way or whatever. \n\nNot sure what you mean in terms of articulating abstract thoughts. What kind of abstract thoughts? 
10	The part about, "why do they articulate so strangely?" stands out to me. I've noticed that in my experience, as an ENTP, ISFJs have to be patient with me while I try to understand and articulate my feelings. Sometimes this can take days or even weeks. (Thank god they're so patient lol.)\n\nIn a similar vein, I need to be patient with them while they articulate their thoughts. Unless they've been raised to be expressive or have trained themselves to be this way, it usually doesn't come naturally for them.\n\nIf I'm aggressive or express anything negative, the general response is for them to shut down and if they need to talk, they become rather inarticulate. The "anything negative" could literally be anything. It could be my facial expression, a slightly raised voice, my body language. These are usually things I'm not aware I'm doing and I have to be more aware of when I'm talking to them. Patience and understanding goes a long way, for both parties.\n\nThat being said, I don't know anything about your situation. But considering the title of the post is "ISFJs seeming stupid," if you do think that ISFJs are stupid, you are likely communicating that message to them indirectly. I wouldn't be too surprised if they are picking up on that as the ISFJs I know are rather observant, even if they tend to keep their observations to themselves.
6	You're home! = I'm happy you're home! or Glad to see you! or I'm acknowledging your existence which means you're important to me!\nHinting about appreciation = They want appreciation.\n\nI'm not sure I understand your second paragraph.  They're doing things they think will make you happy, but you don't actually like it?  You've told them to stop and they do it anyway?\n\nSometimes I use incorrect grammar/pronunciation as a joke, so that could be what's going on.  Still, the person just being bad at grammar or expressing themselves isn't outside the realm of possibility.  It could be a problem with the individual rather than with ISFJs as a whole.
5	"seeming stupid" is a poor way of expressing clashing communication styles. I think some of what you're talking about may just be the person, not necessarily their personality. MBTI types don't dictate everything a person does, but it does help different types better understand each other. 
3	INTP seeming stupid to ISFJ
3	I think that the “You’re home” comment is just them reacting positively to you coming home. 
1	I've found that if you try and understand why they do things, you don't see what ISFJs do as annoying or dumb.
20	Happy mother's day! Just wanted to give a shout out to the most under-appreciated type, in terms of how much they give!! :)	
2	A giant pat on the back
3	What Types Of Gifts Do You Enjoy The Most?	Looking for a gift for an ISFJ and also an ESFJ family member and I'm wondering what type of gift means the most to you? Sentimental value? Practicality? 
8	Something thoughtful and sentimental. It's not how much money you spend but about the thought behind it. I love meaningful gifts. Something that reminds me of you, or if the gift reminds you of me. :)
3	A whole day to my self. \n\nOther than that, I keep telling my husband that I would rather get something i NEED, rather than something "romantic", or "special". After almost 14 years of marriage he still finds it hard to believe.. 
3	Two types of gifts get to me the most:\n\n1) Something practical, where the giver has put a lot of thought into your personality or interests... in my case cookbook with beautiful food porn does the trick. Or a nice journal. \n\n2) Something that can be shared with others, like sweets/snacks or a bottle of wine, perhaps a meal out. What’s even better about receiving a gift is being able to share the experience with other loved ones. 
6	INTJ who’s best friend is an ISFJ.	According to MBTI we shouldn’t really get along, and after reading an old post about how ISFJs perceive INTJs, it’s clear there’s some truth to it.\n\nThat said somehow I managed to become best friends with an ISFJ. It took a long time to get to that point. It’s by far the most meaningful friendship I’ve ever had. We have an enormous amount of respect for the way the other perceives the world. I’ve learned a lot from him about being more easy going and not being so hard on myself.\n\nWe met at work, and soon I’ll be leaving to start my own business. Looking for advice on how to stay in touch with your type and also just to be a good friend in general. Getting him to do stuff outside of work is already a chore, and as an INTJ it’s exhausting being the only one to make the effort. Typically for us the most efficient thing to do in this situation is just drop the friendship. But I don’t want to lose this one.
4	As an ISFJ, I’ll admit that when I make friends at work, I often lose touch pretty quickly after one of us leaves. It’s not that I stop caring or even that I stop thinking about that person, but it does feel like so much more effort to maintain the friendship once we’re not automatically seeing each other every day. I don’t like having to play catch-up every time I text someone because that’s very exhausting for me. \n\nFrom my own experience, it would be easier to maintain a friendship if you make the effort right away to keep in regular contact. If you get in the habit of texting every day, for instance, it won’t seem so difficult to keep up with each other’s lives or make plans. I have a group chat that I’m in with my more extroverted friends and we talk there most days. That makes getting together much more comfortable for me because we’re constantly maintaining the relationships and not having to feel like we’re starting over again every time we hang out. 
2	For me, friendships that trail off because of me are because of things in the realm of social anxiety, and a general feel that our friendship was kind of a "we saw each other a lot but didn't have a ton in common outside of work/school/activity" thing. I still have unopened messages from about a year ago because I didn't know how to respond.\n\nISFJs can also be notoriously hard to get out of their comfort zone. For example, I've played bass for 6 years. My mom took me to a concert last Mother's Day, and I didn't like the band's music to begin with, but the most enjoyable things for me were talking to the bass player afterwards and spending time with my mom.
2	My boyfriend is an INTJ and I am an ISFJ and we get along wonderfully. The only issues we've had is in learning how different we interpret the world,  situations with other people, and how to deal with them. This difference allows us to learn a lot from each other and I feel like I have a bigger perspective of the world!
1	I love working with ISFJ's. I get along great with them, better than anyone else.
1	My best friend is an INTJ. (I’m a ISFJ F.)  He’s wonderful. As many have said, we see the world very differently. However I feel that in this way we help each other so much, to see different perspectives.\n\nI talk to him for hours a day, something I do not do with my other friends. I love that we can have  philosophical talks, but also silly ones. 
1	My fiance is ISFJ and I'm INTJ. Best relationship of my entire life :)
3	INFP here again....	I continually come back to ISFJs for advice. You all make me feel comforted and like I can actually do things. You're encouraging, basically. You give me good vibes and that's something I come back to. I have a job interview in the coming days, I have had a few before, so I kind of know what I'm doing, but I was wondering if you had any tips. Thank you in advance, stay wonderful!
3	I went through this last month with an internal position. It is a blow to the ego, but the right one will come. Keep your head up! 
2	Late to the party, but I hope your interview went well! 
0	"Vote up if you agree" Just want everyone to know, isfj men are the most drought and stupidest species in the world ;(	i'm estp and met these guys on the internet, he seem to like me a lot at first, communicate well so he ask if i like him i said i like him. [But not love man!] i always want to have some one take care of me so i committed in relationships with him but after we committed be in relationships and when i start to fall... he not doing anything except call me all day when i said 'my mother is here we cannot call' but still he called and say love love love you but not doing anything to pls you, i hate him, maybe he thing 'why i have to take care of you because you already mine' while i encourage him everything and say many things just to pls him and it's doesn't mean that if i say i love you you will not doing anything back to us, you are so cruel, now i blocked him...never ever want to see and date isfj again...never ever ps.dont mind my grammar, tx
15	You're an idiot.
5	Your post has terrible English and you are calling ISFJ guys stupid. If you talk like this in real life I’m sure many types will definitely have a hard time understanding you (not just ISFJs). Back to the guy in the post, most of us aren’t that dysfunctional. At the end of the day, one person doesn’t represent a type. I’m sure there are many great ISFJ guys out there. I also think that stereotyping an entire male mbti’s type as stupid says a lot about your own intelligence. That’s like stereotyping all black people as basketball players.
5	Sounds like you had a dysfunctional person and not at all what most of us in the ISFJ community are even remotely like. 
0	At least isfj girls are not cruel, except boys, isfj girls are best :)
2	"Doers" VS. "Thinkers"; "SPs" vs. "NPs"	I have a problem. As an INTP, I often go straight from Ne to Si. Because of this, I have trouble taking action like an SP. Ne is what I like to call the "in a sec" function for NPs. Si is what I like to call the "just in case" function for INPs. They're often either future-oriented or past-oriented and become increasingly more in their head. NPs can take action, but they're often just chasing reward. When they try to jump into a cold shower, there's a mental barrier in the way. At best, they'll ease themselves into it.\n\nSPs manage to take action easily. They're present-oriented. When I say "present-oriented", I'm not referring to the limiting of future and past-orientedness. The present is its own thing just as the past and future are. When you're in the present, you're IN the present.\n\nWhen Se is being used, it's as if they're immersed in the extroverted world in the present, immersed in sensations. They see the black and & white, not what's going on behind the scenes or the inner workings.\n\nI once activated my Se. The mental barrier was virtually non-existent. I reacted MUCH faster. I'd set my intention and do it. I was IN the moment. It's as if I was looking at the external world outside of my head as if I, as opposed to being in my head, was in the extroverted world IN the present. The book I had been wanting to read but haven't touched in months was easily picked up with virtually no mental resistance.\n\nI've tried getting ISTPs and ISFPs to explain how to enter this state of mind, but I think there was a communication barrier. They were having trouble articulating with precision. They explained it but in an Se way which isn't informative enough for me. I'm not sure how ESXPs will be of much more help.\n\nHow can I get through this communication barrier?
8	SJ's just get up & do stuff - I think they have an internal nagging voice imo
1	I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n- [/r/esfj] ["Doers" VS. "Thinkers"; "SPs" vs. "NPs"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ESFJ/comments/8ijza9/doers_vs_thinkers_sps_vs_nps/)\n\n&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
1	Si is just after your Ne, so going straight from Ne to Si is normal.
12	Im an ENFJ male, how on gods green earth do I get my (new) ISFJ GF out of the house! Is there a cycle? Im confused to the bone...	
18	People have said a lot of good things here but I want to mention something else. \n\nHave you been just springing the plans on her last minute, or have you been giving her a heads up? \n\nFor example, if someone says to me "hey you want to see a movie tonight." and the movie is in the next few hours, the answer is most likely going to be no. If they ask in the beginning of the day, it might be a yes. If they ask a day or two ahead of time it probably will be a yes. \n\nWhy? Because I plan stuff out. Even my recharge time. If someone asks if I want to do something a few days ahead of time, I can adjust and make sure I can rest up if I need it. When if you ask me a few hours before something happens in the evening, I'm already winding down and probably getting into the process of getting ready for bed, I'm not going to be going anywhere. \n\nI figured I would mention this, because I noticed a lot of my extrovert friends like to spring stuff on me the last second, and those plans never work out. 
7	If I know we're not going to hang out with people, it's easier for me. Do that a few times, then the 3rd or 4th time, hang out with others, too.
5	Start by going out for food / drinks just the two of you in not too crazy crowded places. After that a few times suggest going out with friends.
5	Just have some one on one time with her outside of the house. They need this kind of safe, non-exhausting bonding time before they are ready to go out with you and other people. She needs to feel 100% relaxed and comfortable with you.
4	I am an ENFJ dating an ISFJ :-)\n\nOur first few dates were just us - dinner, drinks, (watching sports), and then going and doing some one-on-one thing (arcade, bowling, adventures at parks/beaches)\n\nyou just got to appeal to their interests as much as possible. he loves food, beer, sports, and outdoorsy stuff so like its easy. we even like grocery shopping, its little small things like that too. maybe try a library or small coffee place, something that has an appeal.\n\nlike many others have also said about the "people" thing - \nwe still haven't done the whole friend introducing thing yet - but from what I gauge from him, anything with more than a few people is overwhelming. its just a slow but sure process to feel comfy bout who they are with. I'd suggest maybe going out around her friends? or just anywhere she would know people. No one kinda wants to feel like a small puppy following/clinging to that one person they know. 
2	Wauw! I deeply appreciate all these insides! Thank you very much.\n\nIf understand correctly, She needs more confirmation that it will be only...the two of us in a non-crowded place.\n\n
2	She prefers spending time with you alone, or at most a few close friends or family members. Big parties is a no no. But - talk to her and see if you can reach a compromise - that at least once in a while she goes out with you to do something you enjoy. And make sure she gets plenty of alone time afterwords. She will need it to replenish her batteries. 
2	don’t spring plans on her. plan something together. JUST YOU TWO. really low key and casual and romantic. 
1	By the way, why does it take you guys so long to open up? I feels like ages before we get to the "good stuff".\n\nI might not be able to speed up the process but understand your nature my help me be more patient. Sometimes I feel like I have literally pull on things.
1	I’m an ISFJ and social situations are such a struggle because while I love interacting with people, I often get overwhelmed when it’s a bunch of new people I don’t know well. Since I’m introverted, it can be hard to break my way into a group conversation. \n\nWhen you go out with a group make sure to check in on her every so often so she feels comfortable/included. Could be something as simple as touching her leg, giving her hand a squeeze. If we start to get quiet or seem overwhelmed that touch can help ground us again....make us feel important

3	Do ISFJ prefer dogs or cats?	Do ISFJ prefer dogs or cats? Why?\nI'm guessing dogs because you like how clingy they are and you probably don't like how cats don't want to spend as much time with you. 
17	Cats for me.  Haven't really been fond of dogs since one bit me as a kid.  I'm a really low-key introvert so I also don't like how excitable some dogs are, barking and jumping on me.  Cats are generally calmer.  We both like to snuggle and be affectionate and also have some alone time.  
4	Cats for sure! 
5	Cats😸
3	Cats
4	Catssssss\n\nbut they still love dogs and get very excited. 
3	I like both but I enjoy the independence of a cat more. I felt like a monster every time I had to leave my dog, whereas with my cat it was more of a 'bye have a good day' 'you too' kinda thing
3	Cats forever 
2	I prefer dogs that act like cats. Best of both worlds.
3	Dogs dogs dogs dogs.
1	Guilty as charged. 
1	Dogs , but ive noticed my cat seems to be in tune with my feelings more then my dog  when im sad or upset my cat always comforts me.\n
1	I own a kitten but i treat her as a dog :1
1	Cats, but only slightly more than dogs.\n\n
1	Lol. Got it in one. 
1	Dogs
1	I am a dog owner, not super fan of cats. 
1	Difference between male and female ISFJs?	What have you noticed? c:
10	No one questions a female ISFJ's sexuality, a male ISFJ on the other hand . . .
5	I’m a male ISFJ so I’ll throw in my 2 cents. Female ISFJs usually don’t have a problem with feeling accepted by society. There traits are seen as sterotypical normally. They also are able to develop their Fe more than us usually. I as a male ISFJ tend to hide my Fe a lot. On cognitive functions test my Fe and Ti are very close in terms of scores. I don’t show much emotion if I’m not that close to you so you could probably mistype me as an ISTJ until you really got to know me. It also depends on who I’m talking to. With my thinking friends I don’t show very much Fe. With my feeling friends I tend to feel more comfortable showing more Fe. 
3	From what I've seen, I think female ISFJs manage to develop Fe a bit more easily than male ISFJs due to social expectations (men having to be "tough" and "emotionless" and all that...) \n\nMy dad is an ISFJ as well and he was in a Ti loop for a long time because of that as well as other things!
2	ISFJ men mimic ISTJ's - at least my isfj spouse does. It took me forever to figure him out. My best friend (a female) is istj and they are quite similar
2	my experience: as a male ISFJ i find it sometimes hard to be around other extraverts, both female and male. what i find most surprising is the sometimes lack of acceptance from other people. but back on point: i'm not an active contact seeker near females, and when eventually i might start talking they always call me a nice guy and continue on. mostly due to the fact i'm not a daring personality. but also the fact of most people not recognising the different personalities. 
1	My Dad I COULD NOT STOP TYPING ISTP. It took some serious result analysis, and observing the common ISTP traits, until I realized ISFJ fit perfectly. This is because he acts like an ISTP in EVERY WAY, but he cares too much, isn't as guided by logic, and isn't as stereotypically lazy.

3	My mom is an ISFJ and is extremely depressed.	Hello everyone. I'm in need of some advice. My mom is an ISFJ and she has been in a very depressed state for several years now. She has become neglectful of my younger sister, she doesn't take care of herself or anything else without being told to do so, and she has become addicted to playing videogames to the point where she is in her room sitting on her bed everyday playing. She is unable to work due to rheumatoid arthritis which enables her to play all day. I understand what it is to be depressed so I was more than willing to help raise my sister, make sure the house chores got done, and bills got paid. However, I don't know how to help any further. Recently, she has been making minor improvements but I'm afraid that she is just going to fall back into the downward spiral of depression again, which has happened several times before.\n\nAny advice you can give would be wonderful. \nIn case that it might help when giving advice, I'm an INFJ. 
7	As an isfj going through a bout of depression, all I really need from my loved ones is a deep, tight hug. It's really hard to ask since I'm so used to taking care of everyone else. I don't want to bring anyone around me down, so I tend to crawl into myself and let the world exist around me. I'm sorry you're going through this. I hope your mom feels back to herself soon. 
3	This is a thing that happens. Children end up having to take on the role of a parent because the parent takes on the role of a child. It's confusing and upsetting and it ultimately leads to you becoming a highly capable person. Some things you should be careful about: sex problems, drug problems, and other addictions. Common in people who grow up like this.\n\nAs for your mom: Try to empathize with her situation, and help to build her up. All of you are better off if you can get her healthy. That can be very difficult. You very likely need help from a combination of people who understand these kinds of things.\n\nWhat is your extended family like? Any help there?
2	There was a similar thread a while ago in /r/getdisciplined: [\[Need Advice\] My mother is addicted to video games, and it will only take a turn for the worse.](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/7ty3i6/need_advice_my_mother_is_addicted_to_video_games/)\n\nMaybe there is some advice for you in there.
2	My heart goes out to you and your mom. This is a really rough thing to have to deal with.
1	First of all, I heard on youtube that arthritis is caused by a certain bacteria when there's too much of them in the body. Anything that kills unwanted bacteria, such as Bragg's organic apple cider vinegar or some kind of fermented vegetable drink with probiotic (good) bacteria, such as beet kvas, will get rid of a lot of unwanted bacteria. I started to get arthritic pain in my knees, but then I fixed it by drinking the things I just mentioned. So your mother should try those. Also how about getting a boyfriend or pets? I'm going to get pet rats because I heard they're very affectionate & intelligent. Either one of those should be great to lift her spirits. \n
3	Infp trying to be friends with isfj	There's this girl in my group who I want to be friends with. I'm not sure but she seems like an isfj. She gets along with everyone and is really good with people...but she's definately not infj. She's an ambivert and really connected with her friends...but somehow I just don't get through to her. I'm guessing this is becuse she doesn't relate to my thought process of Fi. She finds me unrealistic, a  head in the clouds person and impractical, while I find her as a person who thinks too much about what people think and judgemental. Like idk if it's something personal against me or what, but she keeps insulting me in small ways whenever she can and it's really irritating .we never seem to agree on anything much but I do so If just to keep the peace. Please advice needed? How do we get along? 
7	Why do you want to be friends with her? 
5	There seems to have been an influx of INFPs and ISFJs trying to come together. It makes me happy. \n\nThat being said, it is a bit tough to see eye to eye. We ISFJs can be stubborn and hard-headed. It doesn’t seem like she’s too interested in being friends. Try to be open and honest with your desires and actions. Even tell her that you wish to be friends. It may take time, but show her you’re for real. If it doesn’t work, then let her be. No one can force anyone to like them. 
5	I’m a ISFJ with three INFP friends. The one I connect with extremely well (kinda my SO), another is one I connect really well with emotionally, who’s like a mentor to me, and the other is a distant friend who we used to talk a lot, but just aren’t around each other enough.\n\nIn my case, I really get along with these INFPs because they share similar values. We also can connect emotionally, and be extremely honest about how we feel about things. We usually have some similar interests, and like to share personal experiences. \n\nI think the only issues I’ve really had with INFPs is when they let their “in the movement” emotions control how they act towards others. A few times an INFP friend has acted rude towards me, and then I feel really bad because I feel like it’s my fault or they’re just mad at me. I then find out later they’re only in a bad mood because of a test grade, or of the sort. I’m not used to that because if I have negative feelings or other emotions in general, I try to keep them in line so I don’t take it out on others. INFPs (although not meaning to) seem to have a harder time doing this.\n\nI’d suggest trying to have an honest talk with her in private, saying how you feel and ask what’s up? 
2	Fi and Fe just have a hard time seeing eye to eye. Not to mention N vs S.\n\nMy SO is ISFJ and from my experience (for what it’s worth) is that she has a hard time respecting the abstract and stresses out over helping other people out. She’s basically a mother to all her friends and leaves next to no time for herself to recover or even get a proper sleep.\n\nThis contrasts heavily to me. I will put myself first over others (with the exception of my close loved ones) and make sure I’m taking care of me and my needs. Also she’s even more stubborn than me and that’s saying something. Make sure to choose your words wisely, no accusations. Even if you don’t mean something as an insult she might take it as one. \n \nDon’t know if this helps or not.
1	Also she seems full of herself to me sometimes...no offence to the other isfjs s...sorry😅
3	Have you seen "The Matchbreaker" on Netflix? Do you think the main characters might be an ISFJ(M)/ESTJ(F) couple?	I just watched it for the second time and I laughed just as hard as when I saw it the first time. My wife and I really enjoy this film. The main character seems like an ISFJ to me, not only in his hilarious occupational role (finding crafty ways to break apart relationships, Fe-Ti with Fi helping him repair things and kind of find his north star in the end) but also in his general ISFJ-like appearance and organizational approach. I'm a comparatively brutish thinker-dude and this protagonist is SO ADORABLE. His love interest seemed like an ESTJ to me, much more direct and up-front (maybe pushy at times) in her communication style (Te-dominant), softened by a values-oriented feeling side (Fi) with an impactful aesthetic (Se). Anyway, not to blab but I wonder if anyone else here has seen it.\n\nWe also watched the first episode of Young & Hungry, and Gabi & Josh seem like ESFJ + ENFP. OK I'm done here. Thanks :-)
10	I tried my hand at a few ISFJ memes - any good?	
10	Sorry, I didn't get them.. 
3	To have to explain them means I did a bad job.  Memes should be intuitive...  But that was just my first shot at it.  What I meant to poke fun at with each one:\n\nVampire one: ISFJ doesn't just speak their mind - I often have to guess whats on her mind and then she'll confirm or deny.  \n\nNurse one:  ISFJ clams up when angry.  I liked the intensity of the nurses face - you can see she's about to hit a boiling point - but those lips are sealed.\n\nPoop one: I wouldn't say smothering - more like having that need for companionship.  The ISFJ I know likes a bit of me time at home, but not much - and really doesn't like going places or starting activities alone.\n\nThe hard part is that I don't know what goes on in an ISFJ's head, so I don't know what's relate-able.  To make it worse, my ISFJ is a lot of things ISFJs usually aren't (geeky, atheist, pot smokin, etc.)\n\nWhat does an ISFJ think is funny about themselves - that they don't see as much of in the other types? 
3	An ISFJ is gonna stalk you in the bathroom? Does that refer to smothering behavior?
2	I laughed at the last one haha. I'm definitely a clingy person.
1	Lol, nice
1	Quality post
1	I felt they were spot on, Especially the vampire meme! Even the poop meme is good, my isfj SO will bust into the bathroom on me just to talk or kiss me lol
30	Introverts as pets: isfj warm & fluffy?	
9	We also use perfect stillness as a defence mechanism. And breed profusely. And primarily move around by hopping.
7	I wouldn’t describe myself as cheerful. 
10	Eh, no.
2	So cute! I love the artwork and handwriting style. I know an ISFP dad who compared his ISFJ daughter to a hummingbird. Also, did you show this to INTJs and did they completely lose it? haha. I know a lot of INTJs like to be seen as fuzzy people. Your snake does look pretty sweet though.
2	Aww I have a bunny too! They're the best!
1	Survival of the fittest, why snake instead of tiger? This is discrimination 
5	how to known when an isfj isnt interested anymore	hi all, so i have been seeing/talking to this isfj guy for around a month now and some gut feeling is telling me he is withdrawling/isnt as interested. this is the first week he hasnt tried to make plans, hes stopped asking about my days/other questions on those lines, and out of no where hes just getting more quiet/less responsive. i am not sure if its just him retreating (as an introvert) or otherwise. i dont want to come out as ask and seem needy (like im not getting enough attention) so im trying to be patient to see if it turns but also dont know if im overly optimistic. sorry i know this prob stupid but,  any ISFJs done similar behavior?
6	My ISFJ husband and I usually have several hours of quiet time every day after spending time together. It helps us both recharge and do our own thing. So the social introversion might be coming into play.\n\nBut other than that, I would just suggest for you to ask him. Strong relationships are built on strong communication. If you can't ask him about something relatively small now, how are things going to play out when more dramatic/serious situations come into play?\n\nI think it's normal/healthy to check in with your partner periodically and see how the relationship currently stands.
2	I think as an ISFJ, we have some things we do that are kinda like mandatory - and that is, asking about your day. But ask him, be direct.. he could be busy or going through a stress.. we also move very slow.
1	Your personality is?
1	I do that when I’m not interested  anymore. But there obviously can be other reasons for his behaviour too. Maybe there’s something going in his life which is why he doesn’t feel like talking much. You could ask him how is he, in case you haven’t tried that yet. Maybe he’ll open up.
1	i wouldn't jump to that conclusion right away- i tend to feel like i am annoying people i just meet and will be less social for a little bit after having some times where i see or talk to them regularly. it doesn't have anything to do with me liking someone any less, it just has to do with me trying to not be annoying and also needing time alone. i say reach out a few more times and see what happens, but if he really isn't responding then let it go :/
1	I'm in a bit of a retreating stage myself and it may help if you initiate plan(s) or try to see what's going on. It may not work, but it's worth a shot. Showing that you care can't hurt.\n\nEDIT: If it's worth mentioning, my two closest friends are ENFJ. One tends to lay on the "hey are you ok" if they feel there's an issue, and the other is a bit more reserved in that sense but he's also known me for 13 years. I like both approaches, but asking if your person is ok is probably a good way to avoid losing ground with him (idk a good phrase for that)
1	The best thing to do is just ask him. If I was in this situation, I would appreciate it if you were open and communicated with me. You won't come across as needy!
9	ENFPer here wondering whether any of you have dated one of 'us' and made it work?	
10	I'm an ISFJ and I'm marrying an ENFP in November!
7	I can't say that it worked but I ran into two ENFPs while dating and they both irritated the shit out of me.\n\nThey were both really nice, interesting and had a lot of energy. The problem was when something didn't go the way they wanted it resulted in very sudden swing of mood to anger or unreasonable behavior.\n\nOne of them was hungry during a city trip and asked me to get her fries. We managed to buy fries and I headed to our destination to eat them there. But she wanted to have them immediately. We were standing on the sidewalk somewhere and it was only 500m to where we could sit in a park on a bench. When I refused and asked her to come with me she started walking slower and 10m behind me, looking at the ground, kicking stones. She was like a damn toddler.\n\nYes, I get that you're hungry and I really, really want to help you but please be an adult while I try.\n\nIn the end it was too much dealing with big reactions over small irritations which gets me into alarm mode. Also this can be over as quick as it came. Give the girl a hand full of peanuts and she will start smiling and dancing around again. But the conflict sticks with me as ISFJ. I get super concerned and need to calm down for much longer.\n\nIf you want to make it work then make sure to create a game plan for when one of you gets irritated/triggered. Teach each other to recognise it and how to deal with it.
7	ENFP married to ISFJ since 1996! Yes it can work if you see each other for who you really are and truly appreciate the strengths each bring to the relationship. Not always easy but 100% worth it
3	Hi! Makes 7 years that I am together with my ENFP. At first we struggled a little, mainly due to my difficulty of understanding and transmitting my emotions and also my constant need of attention. For me to understand his deep, complex and confuse mind was (and sometimes still is) difficult. He always have a broader way to see things, while I try to keep them simple (this dfference is good, but can cause disagreements some times).\nWhat contribues to the stability of our relationship is look to detect and solve any problem (for smaller that it may seem) as fast as we can, without affraid of exposing the deepest toughts, and willing to do the best to understand the other's reasons.\nThe key is look for attend the needs of the other, and try to understand the limits of your companior in accomplishg yours.
4	So my friends and I all think I'm an ISFJ, because a lot of the stuff I've read says "yeah, that's me" but I've never gotten that on the Briggs - Meyer, got ISFP and oddly enough ENFP. So, no... I don't even get along with myself! Ha!
2	ENFP male married to ISFJ woman\n\nDoes it work?  Any combination can be made to work...  Although ot feels more so like we are roommates with kids... I'm bored a lot.   She is content hanging around the house where that drives me crazy.   She is supportive though.  So that's another positive. \n\n
1	I know of two ENFP-ISFJ marriages, in first the ENFP is the woman and ISFJ is the man, in second ENFP is the man and ENFP is the woman. In socionics this relationship is described as "semi-duality" which is ranked as one of the better type matches: [**Love Types for ISFJs**](http://personalitycafe.com/isfj-articles/285-love-types-isfj-5.html#post4235430). As to why this doesn't happen more often? Perhaps because both are feelers and sometimes relationships between F-types can start feeling like friendships, but they can certainly be supportive for each other.
2	Julie Aidem on Wonder Years - ISFJ?	
1	Is Julie Aidem an ISFJ? Is this how ISFJ girls act to their boyfriends? 
12	how goal-oriented are you?	i'm usually a go with the flow type of person (even if i have a shit ton of things that i want to do and end up doing nothing at all) but lately i've been thinking i should start focusing on something, mostly career-wise so that i can (hopefully) support my family better in the long run. do any of you feel/think the same? how do you keep yourself centered on a goal?
10	[deleted]
5	I’ve always been really goal-oriented. It’s helpful for me to have tangible endpoints to confirm that I’m on the right track or at least moving forward. I don’t know exactly what I’m working toward right now and it makes me feel really lost, like I’m just treading water. 
3	I am shitty at decision making. What worked for me in the past to achieve a goal was to turn the way there into really braindead habits. There was no question if, why or how I would do something. It was just something that I did. End of story. When you put the time in continuously you will reach the goal.
2	i'm very goal orientated. i don't want much in my life. but i do want to be able to afford a family and i want to live a happy and fulfilled life. and i am dedicated to doing the things i believe will help me toward those goals.
1	I can relate. I’m in college now and I want to be in a profession where I make enough money to one day Support my family. 
1	I'm not goal oriented at all!
1	I've come to realize i'm not goal oriented at all. And i've found out in the worst possible way: While working for the thesis that i need to obtain my title.\n\nUsually i work well with projects cos i get a deadline from my bosses. The thing here is that i have no deadlines for this, just the one i may decide for myself. And ive donde this twice already, and twice i haven't been able to do it.
5	What’s the key giveaway that someone is actually an ISFJ as opposed to an ESFJ?	
15	Speaking as an ISFJ: I’m perfectly content to be alone for long stretches of time. I enjoy being with my friends and socializing with coworkers, but it takes me a while to feel lonely or feel the need to seek out company. I think an ESFJ would feel antsier after a significant amount of alone time. 
10	They're quite different, but it's not how social they are. Either/or can be asocial or extravagant. In general though, ISFJs have a certain stoicism to them. Their Fe is under the control of Si. So, it's really only used whenever the ISFJ's Si feels like it. This contrasts the ESFJ where their Fe is 24/7. And in the ISFJ, you can see Fi in them. Sometimes they come off an INFPs.\n\nThis's a tiny bit more advanced theory, but there's Fe- and Fe+. Fe- is centered around negative emotions, or regulating them. Fe+ more around cheer and making it goes up and up and up, but not bother with negative emotions. The difference can be illustrated in this scenario:\n\nImagine you're at a party with an ESFJ and ISFJ, and let's say there's a person crying in the corner. The ISFJ's Fe- would want to remove any negativity, thus probably go talk to the person. ISFJs want to mend things. In contrast, the ESFJ would not bother too much. They wanna make the party louder and happier.\n\nNow, in this aspect, i believe the difference in Fe- and Fe+ is less appearant in xSFJs. Both xSFJs have a strong sense to protect the vulnerable and can be very compassionate. It's just that ISFJs have more drive to do so and understand the individual more. That is if they choose to value Fi.\n\nAlso about Fe+ in ESFJ. + functions do badly in negative environments. If there was a conflict between two people, the ESFJ will make a battleground turn into a holocaust. ISFJ will make it peaceful. But if there's no conflict and atmosphere is positive, the ISFJ will depress it to a balanced state. ISFJs are less excitable and pushy. ESFJs are pushy. Even though both can be social, ESFJ is a bit more "HEY, MAN! WHAT'S GOING ON? LOL XD"\n\nAnother thing to note is their moods. ESFJs' mood is more dependent on the social atmosphere. Crowd is cheering? They're cheery. Crowd is bored? They're bored. ISFJ moods are more independent. They have this pent up system. It regulates itself whenever it wants to, then builds up anger/negativity, EXPLODES, then goes back to normal. ISFJs are kinda edgy at times.\n\nRegarding Si. ESFJs have Si+ which is increasing comfort. Actively make means of what is comfortable. ISFJ's have Si-, removing discomfort. This's not to make anything comfortable, just not uncomfortable. I think a good example is fitness. Let's say an ESFJ and ISFJ both wanna lose some chub. The ESFJ will actually make a habit of exercising, going outside,  hitting the gym. In contrast, the ISFJ will be more lazy. Their way of getting better health is simply by avoiding unhealthy things. Dieting would work smooth for them. Actual fitness? Not common.\n\nAnother key difference is how you see the xNTP in them that comes out at times. In ESFJ, you see this little INTP. They want to become fluent in Ti analysis, show an inner "Aspergerian". In contrast, the ISFJ wants Ne. ISFJs have a more natural eccentricity to them. ESFJs try to be weird. ISFJs are just OG bizarre.\n\nAlso that inner xNTP is shown in their non-conformism. ESFJs are conform more to norms. They'll only change if someone is getting hurt. ISFJs like to be edgy. Between a conversation with a friend of mine yesterday, we came to an agreement that outta all the sensors, ISFJs are probably one of the most non-comformist.\n\nEDIT - in the example of fitness. ESFJ and ISFJ would be reversed. EDIT - changed 'rebellious' to 'non conformist'
4	My understanding is that extroverts get their energy from others, while introverts get energized from alone time. As an ISFJ I get worn down if i spend too much time around people, as much as I love and thrive on bonding with others.
1	I have an ESFJ wife and I relate my socializing time with all of her plans as a battery and she zaps it every once in awhile and it’s always a tough discussion every time that I need alone time to recharge. She doesn’t get it and thinks an hour here and there it’s plenty and I’m like noooo.
1	for me (ISFJ) my self consciousness is enough to keep me from socializing, even though i love to. whereas an ESFJ has the same sensitivity but it doesn’t deter their social nature. this might be an oversimplification. 
1	ESFJ are chatterboxes. My ESFJ friend talks for a long time if I just say one little sentence to him.
1	ISFJ: Would be more comfortable with alone time and staying at home more often.\n\nESFJ: Would probably get more antsy and anxious when spending too much time alone. Would need to go out and socialize more\n\nThis post from personality cafe talks about the differences in depth http://personalitycafe.com/#/topics/1171186
1	I thought I was an ESFJ for some time but after working with a bunch of them... I'm much more laidback.  My ESFJ colleagues are always running around doing something, looking for things to do (we work in disabled people's home so it includes making calls for them, cleaning their houses if they can't etc) and are really perfectionist when doing so, yknow the stereotypical making sure things are clean and tidy and getting mad at others when they're not to their standards.\n\nI work with one other ISFJ and we are really good at planning things, for example planning a trip away with one of the customers.  We think of all the practical things she needs and how we'll carry out the tasks to ensure everything goes smoothly.  The ESFJs are good at thinking of the feel good things to take eg to pamper the customer with and they're good at carrying this out with their hands-on Fe.  
13	How did you know yourself? I have no idea what I'm doing.	I'm 19 years old and haven't discovered my passion. My friends are smart walking encyclopedias and I want to be like them. An example would be learning about capitalism. Without the will to read, my introductory book to capitalism is useless. It doesn't help that my brain can't absorb anything I'm forced to.\n\nMy next problem: friendships. When talking to some of my friends, I often have to walk on eggshells. I can't always be understanding, considerate and helpful. Sometimes their sensitivity and weakness come off as very stupid to me. These thoughts aren't revealed to them, but sometimes I slip. Cutting them off to find more suitable friends isn't an option because I care about them. And then there are my smart, matured and developed friends who are difficult for me to handle. Most of the time, I feel like we're not on the same wavelength and can't keep up with them.\n\nI have no fucking idea what to do here. What kind of friend should I be? Which type of person am I?
9	First I'll say you are 19 years old.  Most other 19 year olds also have no idea what they are doing.  I'm 33 and barely know what I'm doing most of the time.  If you see reading as a chore find a good netflix documentary on capitalism or get an audiobook on the subject to listen to while you are in the car.  As friends go I have learned over the years as an ISTJ to just keep my mouth shut.  Not many people want what I consider to be constructive criticism, they just want someone to talk to.  If asked "what would you do, or what should I do."  then I give my honest advice.  I'm always quick to apologize when I hurt people's feelings because honestly I don't think anyone intentionally means to just hurt people.  I try my best to explain "hey sorry sometimes I don't see that I'm being an insensitive asshole".  The best way to be a good friend and good at social situations is being around friends and in social situations.  It will take time to stop the 'slip ups' and learn to find the balance of being yourself and being too much of yourself.  
4	Hey bro then the best thing about our personality is to explore! :) I did that and found my love for music and film photography. \nAs for friends, find one or two who you can at least ramble to. And be with humble people :) 
2	This isn’t the best advice, but know you’re not alone. For me, I had to ride it out — I was lucky enough to be motivated in college, but I suffered in a lot of other areas, including friendships. At 24 I’ve come to terms with the fact that some people that you care for will not ever be those “close” friends, and that some people you consider “close” friends will never feel that way about you. You will find those people that mean everything to you and vice versa, even though it may take a few years.\n\nWith regards to “knowing what you’re doing” — good luck. Like I said, I’m 24, have a great job, have a good support system, and life is still throwing me huge curveballs. The secret is winging it indefinitely. And finding something that you enjoy — maybe not even in terms of a career; just something you like that you can pour some energy into. Running, hiking, learning, music. Anything.
2	Thinking is the weak spot of ISFJs, why you are going for more thinking sessions instead of real life experiences?\nMake use of the creativity like 3 years old deep inside yourself to keep you moving and discover what makes you happy and tell you who you are.

4	trying to be more human	I live with depression. And i don't take any medication for it. I started seeing therapy a few months ago and it's a great help. Anyways, I have this thing i do. it's a crutch i've developed to deal with the depression. and the crutch is  basically to deal with any problems or issues i have immediately.\n\nif i'm sad, i must recognize it, dissect it, understand it, solve it or let it go. same with anger or any strong negative emotion.\n\ni don't allow myself to wallow. both to save time and go straight toward solving it but to also not give myself the chance to let it pull me back to who i used to be all those years ago. someone who was depressed, angry, egotistical, and suicidal and an emotional burden on others.\n\nmy therapist says that i can't cut it out cold turkey because i need it to live basically. and i need to learn to slowly be comfortable with myself and simmer in problems and believe i can do it safely from time to time. she also told me that i chances are I become an asshole so i should stop fearing that. \n\nbut i still find that it's something that makes me incredibly alienating and makes it hard to help or comfort people due to a lack of empathy in their need to wallow a bit. and i fear it pushes people away. and i guess i'm frustrated with it. and i'm looking for a solution to it as i always do. or maybe this is good for me, to vent like this. and just be frustrated that i have to be frustrated.\n\ni don't know. does anyone else here have this problem? their need to always have to solve their issues, almost always alone, and don't want their emotions to be a burden on anyone else to the point where we become alienating.
3	Hmm, I feel like I can relate to aspects of what you’re saying for sure, although I’m not sure that I take it to the extreme that I’m hearing in your self-description? \n\nI think the constant overanalyzing is definitely a thing for me, and I wouldn’t be surprised if other ISFJs related to it too, having Ti in our function stack. It’s something I’ve been trying to work on too, although it’s been a slow thing that’s sort of come to me in phases. \n\nThe first thing was a few years ago, realizing that some people don’t need their problems solved. Sometimes somebody knows what they want or need to do about a situation and just need to vent and feel heard and understood by another person, or maybe they’re not ready to find the answer yet. That can be hard to understand for me, because my immediate impulse is “Help! Fix it! Make it go away! Restore peace and happiness!” But sometimes that’s not really what a person needs, and they just want to let off the emotional steam when they’re telling you about a problem. Honestly, sometimes just complaining about something *is* the answer. I’m sometimes better about it and sometimes not so great, but I try to remember to just ask when I’m not sure what someone needs from me—is this a problem you’re asking for help in solving, or do you just need me to listen? \n\nAnd then, much more recently, I’ve been trying to learn to do the same for myself. I pick my feelings apart constantly, like you said. It’s never just, “I feel sad.” I have to think about why I feel sad, what’s upsetting me, what particular type of sadness it is, brainstorm solutions for it. And sometimes that is really useful! Particularly with feelings of anxiety, being able to look inside myself and find the truth of why I feel the way I do, what set me off and how it turned into the feeling I’m experiencing, is really useful! But sometimes it also just leads to me running circles around my own head, going “WHY DON’T I KNOW WHAT’S WRONG WITH ME, I’M SO BROKEN AND USELESS, I’LL NEVER BE ABLE TO FIX THIS!” \n\nSo, one thing that I’ve found that helps a lot is journaling. Getting the thoughts out of my head in a totally open, stream-of-consciousness way has helped me a lot in transforming vague thoughts and anxieties into proper statements, and once they’re down on paper, I can actually put those analytical skills to use! Looking at my sentence structures, finding the negative words I use about myself and my situations and brainstorming how to turn them into positive phrases, creating a more concrete understanding of the things my brain does that are unhelpful and finding ways to be kinder to myself. \n\nAnd that’s the other big part of it, really, is being kind to myself. I’m *so fucking mean to myself.* Seeing my thoughts written out made me really have to stop and look at it, and think, is this the way I want to live my life? Does it make me happy to treat myself like a machine? Does it help the people around me for me to hate myself and constantly put myself down? Am I being unkind to them because I’m not content within myself? Do I want to look back on my life and see that I spent the entire time making myself miserable, trying to force myself to be a “perfect” version of myself that I don’t even really like? \n\nAnd that’s kind of opened the door for me, because the answer is no. I don’t want to be a fake perfect version of myself and hold myself to an unreachable emotional standard and spend my life stressed out and pissed off at myself for not being able to reach it. If I feel sad today for no reason? Okay. I feel fucking sad. It’s not the ideal way to spend a day, so if I can make myself happy and maybe get a couple things done on top of it, that would be nice. But if I need to just take the day to wallow, that’s just fine, too. It doesn’t mean I’m less than or not enough or weak or any of the other things I tell myself, and as long as I’m not asking them to solve my problems for me, it’s okay to talk to people about it! The people who love me want to know what’s up with me, and it’s not a terrible, burdensome thing for me to say “yknow, I’m having a rough day/week/month/year.” I wanna hear about my friends’ lives, and it would make me sad if they felt like they couldn’t talk to me about their feelings! So I have to trust that they wanna hear about mine, too. \n\nAnyway, I dunno if any of that is helpful to you or not, but you’re not alone at least! Sorry for the long, rambling answer, I’m pretty sleep-deprived and don’t have the mental bandwidth to go back and edit it down. Take care, and best of luck to you! 
2	Oh man, I always solve my problems right away and solo. I've been in therapy for 2 years for bipolar disorder (feelin' ya on that depression) and really my therapist hasn't said that it's a problem for me to do things the quick-solve way. She says as long as I feel satisfied with my emotions and my method of emotional regulation that it can be a good thing. So many people in this world take their issues out on others to a negative impact. That being said, sometimes I do feel like I'm sweeping things under the rug a bit. I watch people outwardly struggle with feelings and I'm like "maybe I should do that too to fully process my emotions". I'd say 90% of the time I'm glad that I have the ability to quick-solve and I feel resolved. 10% of the time I feel like I'm just trying not to be a burden and that maybe I should say more or do more or... something. But I don't know what else to do.

4	I have a isfj best friend... Were like brothers... I wonder what you guys think of infp's	
4	I love them. I delight in them. P's are my favorites but infps, they are good for my soul. those are the go deep friends. 
1	I LOVE INFPs! \n\nI know three personally; one is kinda an SO, one is like a mentor, the other a distant friend.\n\nWith all three, I love the emotional honesty and similar values. We have some similar interests, and have the same sense of humor. \n\nIf anything, INFPs are some of the most selfless people I’ve ever met. They really care, although this can make them super stressed out. They hold true to their values, yet at the same time are really good at compromising. And they also are EXTREMELY smart. 
1	I also love INFPs. I’ve known at least two infps during my life, both my friends. One of them is my childhood friend and I feel like we’ve always got along so well. We have never really fought or had arguments, it’s been smooth all this time which is rare for someone like me who is likely to start arguments. Then the other infp, we had our ups and downs, but I think I personally found her so attractive, because she was so sweet and friendly to everyone. And we could definitely understand each other because we’re both introverts and had the same kind of humour. 
0	MBTI is astrology	
2	And thus another person who doesn't know the theory behind Typology beyond "o u so liek the outsides! BIG EXTRAVURT". Bet he thinks ISJs are traditional and ENTPs are social... yeah, right.
12	Fellow ISFJs, do y’all write about your feelings?	I know as ISFJs we have Fe and sometimes we need to vent to others to understand our emotions better. But I also like to write my feelings out when I’m alone. Both ways for me are helpful when it comes to processing my emotions. How about you guys do y’all like to write about your feelings 
21	I mostly just talk to myself a lot.
14	Not at all, I kind of hate writing journals and I don't express my feelings clearly. Apart from the cringe it produces to read my own words, it makes me anxious to know my thoughts are physically written and someone could read them. So I prefer to go through my feelings mentally and ruminate them endlessly. 
4	YES! I started journaling just on my computer especially on bad days or when I need to process my thoughts.
4	I don't like writing down my feelings let alone talking about them or even thinking about them. This is something I should work on more now that its been mentioned. Thanks.
3	I use Penzu journal when things get really stressful\n\nDoes feel good to have some outlet to sort feelings especially ones you dont feel comfortable sharing with people necessarily
3	Yes, in fact I vastly prefer writing to venting. I've journaled since I was a little kid. Not every day, just days when I feel like I need to. It helps me sort out my thoughts and sort of mentally "file away" feelings that are weighing on me. It clears my head, and I notice that on nights when I journal before bed, I sleep a lot better.\n\nOften I will use journaling as sort of a filter. If something is bothering me, I will sit down and get it all out on paper. Then, if there are still pieces bothering me after I've written it down, I'll talk to someone about it.
3	Yes!! I started journaling regularly a couple months ago and it’s really been soooo helpful in figuring out what’s going on in my head. Even talking out loud can be too ephemeral, but having my feelings properly written down, on paper or digitally, is really really helpful in looking objectively at my own feelings and spotting negative thought processes and ways I make myself anxious. I never felt like I was “good” at journaling because my memory is shit, but just having that record of my stream of consciousness is really nice. 
2	I'm not into writing down my feelings either, I'm an emotionless, closed book. I do start to obsessively and compulsively make lists when I feel overwhelmed if that counts?
2	I have always thought about it, but in the end, I could never bring myself to actually compose anything. I just feel that I cannot simply put what I'm feeling into words. I do talk to myself often, but it feels really different from writing. I guess I ramble a lot and that itself makes it hard to jot down anything. Or perhaps it could be due to me being unable to put my feelings into words. 
4	I don’t like journaling at all. 
1	I write letters a lot about what I want to say but don't think I can, then just put them in the recycling. Or burn them. That's more therapeutic. 
1	Yes, I have been writing out my feelings for as long as I could write. My journals start when I was about 5 years old.. and I wrote more and more as I got older. I still do as an adult. I need to put them somewhere, there are so many feelings.
1	When not complaining to friends online, i tend to do three things. One is write poetry/lyrics. Two self-indulgent interviews. Three... just a diary.
1	I've tried it multiple times and each time I found that I would just journal my day rather than writing down my issues and concerns. Saying that, my friend is also an ISFJ and she swears by it. So I probably haven't helped at all! haha.
1	I do.. but I feel I cannot express myself much especially about emotions... I am feeling too much already, that I somehow cannot put them into words - when I do, it's short and simple, almost indirect, can never directly put it down on paper.
5	What MBTI type is the most romantically desirable to you? (Click the title to answer the short survey I made about it. The results are shown at the end :) )	
9	On this sub I sometimes feel like the only person who doesn’t know the MBTI type of their friends and family. 
2	ENTP: How do I know if an ISFJ is interested?	- Co-workers (different team)\n- Invited me on his backpacking trip\n- Occasionally we will text, will talk in office when we see each other
7	Two things that I find myself doing subconsciously when I'm attracted to someone:\n\n1. Making an effort to be around them as much as possible, for as long as possible. Calculating excuses to interact with them more often than normal.\n\n2. Acting exponentially more energetic and social than normal. This is huge. Normally I am more reserved and less talkative at social events, but if someone I'm interested in is around, I find myself acting more extroverted in groups (joking and goofing off, telling stories, and generally taking a more active role in conversating).\n\nThese signs of attraction are probably true of most personality types, but with introverts it's a dead giveaway.\n\n(copied from a previous post)
7	Observe how he treats others. If he's being nicer and caring to you (to great lengths and overexerting himself) much more than than to others (and if you seem to be the priority person), he probably likes you.
2	How many people were on the backpacking trip?
1	You’re a hilariously brilliant entp, he’s interested. My entp boyfriend and I (isfj) had a natural pull to one another - we just wanted to be close to one another and spend time with each other. Our first date ended up being around 10+ hours long, with excessive texting after when we couldn’t see one another. Prior to either party indicating interest, we may not be as inclined to be so foreword with texting, conversing, and making attempts to be too close as to not overwhelm you with our fascination with you. ;) 
7	Are we incapable with xNTPs?	Edit: **I MEANT "INCOMPATIBLE" NOT "INCAPABLE"!**\n\nNot sure if it's an ISFJ-INTP thing or it's just me. I couldn't go along well with two out of three INTPs I met. Friendship with first INTP lasted four-five months before it gradually crumbled (we became incompatible friends), and second INTP was rather strange, apprehensive, and complicated. Both INTPs have hurt the fuck out of me (not deliberate) just for being INTPs and since I'm such a soft, sensitive and fragile anxious soft fuck. As for the third INTP, we're... okay, I guess. \n\nENTPs - I've only met one; very difficult social chemistry. Conversations feel forced and unnatural.\n\nWhat has your experience been?
6	My boyfriend is an INTP and I'm an ISFJ. We've been together 4 years. Our relationship works really well. I'm a pretty well rounded ISFJ though, and we met later in life. (We met when I was 27 and he was 26). We joke that if we met any earlier in life it would never work. 
5	My experience is that unless there's some mutual interest that they can share (sport or a hobby or something like that) then there will be an incompatibility in personalities.
4	Haven't had enough experiences with ENTPs to judge but they seem fun. One of my closest friends is INTP and we get along very well. I think it works that greatly because I'm not really sensitive. She tends to test out other people's limit so by staying chill it's like I'm passing some sorts of test. We can talk about anything and I help her out with dealing with her feelings because that's clearly something she's not used to doing. And she teaches me a great deal about rationalizing my thoughts and feelings before freaking out. \n\nI really like INTPs and Ti dom in general, but I can understand that you would feel anxious when facing someone with low Fe. I know my INTP friend might seem cold (she's aware of it but doesn't know what to do about it) but it's just her way of saying things, she's actually one of the funniest and chillest people I know :) \n\nBasically, I think we can be compatible, it's just a question of understanding each other (or at least trying to) and of maturity for both of our types (as we can be really anxious and they can lack social awareness). Anyways, I'm sorry you had bad experiences, I hope you meet a great and fun xNTP as well :)
5	ENTP married to my ISFJ husband. One of my closest friends is an ISFJ as well.\n\nI think it depends. There are some people you just will or won't get along with irregardless of personality type. Maybe you just don't have the same interests or aren't in the same stage of development in life.\n\nI think my husband and I are amazingly compatible. It's a very easy relationship. If/when we argue (rarely), it's resolved within a few hours and is always a misunderstanding instead of a difference in opinion. Only problem is that sometimes it's SO easy/peaceful I get this strange itching to start drama via debate. This is when I go and try to find some new ideas/interests to play with so I don't harm my relationship.\n\nOvertime as my Fe and his Ti develops, we've had a much deeper relationship. Now he's able to discuss all the crazy thoughts/theories that go through my head every second, and I'm able to check in with his feelings and see if he's doing okay.\n\nI don't think our relationship would've worked out very well had I not developed Fe and had he not developed Ti however. \n\nThere are some ENTPs that he's met that he absolutely HATES (in that really nice "I'm still going to talk to you but secretly loathe you" ISFJ sort of way haha!) because these ENTPs don't have Fe and don't yet realize it pisses people off when you push their buttons for fun. Similarly there are some ISFJs that can't follow my train of thought and only want to talk about the day to day. The both of us met somewhere in the middle.\n\nI feel like our relationship only gets better over time. :)
3	Married to an ENTP and we’re okay :)
4	I (INTP/M) have been living with my love (ISFJ/F) for five years now, and it's been a roller coaster.  \n\nI hurt her feelings, and am always surprised when it happens.  I understand that I need to be more sensitive in the way I speak and think about the ways she could take (what I think of as) neutral comments.  She will get so mad at me for saying something she finds insulting, and will stay mad even after she realizes I didn't mean it the way she took it.  It can be really rough.  And this happens almost like clockwork every 9-11 days.  \n\nThe hurt feelings used to last for days and were rough on both of us.  Lately I have found that if I don't take her anger personally, and just continue to be sweet to her while avoiding sharing my perspective on the disagreement, things calm down really quickly.  Instead I write down what I would like to say and how I'm feeling, just to get it out of my head.  I'm not sure how sustainable this is, but it's been working pretty well for the last couple months.  She/we get mad for an hour or less, as opposed to a whole day plus.\n\nI read an article a while back that said the INTP/ISFJ combo needs breaks,  short times apart on a regular basis.  I mentioned that to her at the time and she took it as confirmation of her fear that I just wanted an excuse to not be around her, and it caused a weekend of hurt. But I think a weekly break of a day would be great for our relationship.  It might break this 10 day fight cycle.  \n\nDo you find that you mostly get along really well, and then when you disagree on something everything goes wrong?
3	I think you meant incompatible... \n\nAccording to socionics isfj should get along great with intp's & especially entp's - I have yet to see this irl though
3	The difficulty with INTP's is due to their very weak Fe. ISFJ's are very social for introverts and INTP's struggle being social as it takes extra mental effort to process auditory communication.\n\nENTP's can be very polar for ISFJ's. Some are crazy, others are toned down and collected.\n\nI've been with my ISFJ for nearly 10 years and sometimes she's the one forcing me out of the house when all I want to do is stay home after work and have quiet time.\n\nAt the same time, ENTP's are great for coaxing ISFJ's into challenging themselves, developing new skills and learning that the world isn't a scary place.\n\nISFJ's are great for teaching ENTP's to develop Fe and take others into consideration before blurting harmless but rude jokes and observations. That took me a couple years to flesh out.\n\nTechnical communication between ISFJs, ESFJs, INTPs and ENTPs is fantastic in my opinion due to the same cognitive functions.
3	My boyfriend is ENTP. I can’t imagine a better relationship. My best friend of over a decade is an INTP. I think compatibility becomes a problem with intjs and entjs. Our POLR is Te and role is Ni (Socionics), both in which they use strongly - this is an insecurity point for us.\n\nAnyway, love me some entps and intps sooooo big!
4	Just my own observation, not concrete:\n\nMy husband is an INTP, my sister is an ISFJ. They tolerate each other but fundamentally don't get on. This very much appears to be a clash of personality rather than anything actually happening. My sister is pretty sensitive and takes everything to heart, my husband can be a bit of a brick to the face and doesn't give a shit. They've known each day 10 years and the time has just made it worse
2	INTP guy dating an ISFJ girl here. We seem to have had a solid 3 year relationship with a couple bumps. We’ve been loyal and very transparent with each other. She on the other gets easily frustrated due to the fact that my mind is all over the place and I’m not as careful and thoughtful as she is. She does find me very understanding, which helps her put up with me.
1	My gf is ISFJ, and I'm INTP. We've been together for over 8 years. We have very similar personalities in terms of having contempt for ignorant people, enjoying good food, listening to similar music, communicating well... So it's possible. 
1	I adore INTP's!  I currently have a "thing" with one of them and I've had a thing in the past.  Provided there is mutual respect and open communication between both of us, I find we have a lot in common.\n\nI can get along with ENTPs but again there needs to be mutual respect and I find that's difficult for both sides.  I sometimes feel an ENTP says things for a reaction and I feel they cross the line sometimes (compared to an INTP who I feel like they cross the line but unintentionally) and they probably feel we sit on the fence too much, are too "proper" and guarded.
4	When you are caught in an Ne grip...	What in the heck do I need to do to snap you out of it?\n\nAsking for a friend...
1	ENTP says : "Why so serious ?"\n\nISFJ says : "Clean your room, take a shower and eat a correct meal, dammit. Take fucking care of yourself."
1	It's so cute though. For me it seems to help to talk about the past, or ask about what's up with other people. Not that I'm trying to be manipulative with my ISFJ, just sharing the things that seem to jump us out of Late Night Ne Hyperspace. Examples:\n\nHer: "OMG we could move to Spain! Seriously, we could do it!" [Those convincing eyes...I'm watching my comfortable house begin to disappear as I sit in it]\n\nMe: "What's new with Trump?"\n\nHer: "OH MY GOSH. Did you hear about..."\n\nOR\n\nHer: "Look, here are some people who live on a barge in the Great Salt Lake. What would our equivalent of that be?"\n\nMe: "When you were a kid, what kind of peanut butter did you get on your sandwiches?"\n\nHer: "Are you kidding me? We got the grossest brand ever, it was like..." (long discussion about Mom ensues)
8	Advice for a struggling INFP. (I Value ISFJs and Their Opinions Greatly.)	Hi, INFP here. I'm really beating myself up. I have obsessive compulsive, depression, and anxiety. I am seeing a therapist and am on medicine. I only mentioned that to put things in perspective. My thinking is not exactly normal or orderly. ISFJs always seem to have valuable insight and tend to see concrete solutions where I cannot. I have been beating myself up recently over many things. \n\n1. I was supposed to go out of town and stay with a family member for ten days. I made it one night and one day and ended up coming home the second night. \n\n2. I am at the age where I am supposed to decide what I want to do and begin figuring out my life. I have an INTJ parent and an ESFJ parent. They both understand me in different ways, but neither of them fully understands me. I am beating myself up because I can't figure out what I want to do + I feel like I am a failure and will always be a failure. \n\n3. As mentioned above, I feel like I will never succeed. I am in the INFP Hermit Mode, currently. (Basically the dark side of INFPs, falling into a state of mental illness and physically frozen and cut off from the outside world. On average I have left my house less than twice a week for the past two years. I don't have any true friends anymore, they either ignore me or just don't care.) Being in Hermit mode, I don't want to do anything. I know that I need to get a job and I want to start providing for myself/working, but at the same time I feel like I won't be able to hold a job or do anything properly. \n\nThere's more, but honestly I don't even know how this post will go over.\n\n**PS. I love you, ISFJ. You all are so kind, caring, and helpful. Anytime I've ever needed help, the ISFJ in my life has been amazing. Here on reddit you all have been amazing. If this post isn't okay or appreciated, just let me know. I just like having the input of other personality types and most of the other types don't care enough/are generally mean about things. You all are almost always kind, gentle, and you genuinely care. I'm not trying to use you to solve my problems, I just appreciate and request your special outlook on the world.**\n\nAlso, I started crocheting for my anxiety (as suggested by a family member) and made a full size blanket in less than a week, so there's that. Oh! Any stress relieving/anxiety relieving strategies you have would be incredibly welcomed and helpful. \n\n*If this post isn't appropriate please let me know and I will take it down. I have so much respect for this community and don't want to upset anyone.* 
7	Hi there! Thank you for your kind words about us :) This comment might get really long, I hope you don't mind! Also, it's probably going to sound really... stereotypically naive.\n\nI see things have been tough for you! It's a good thing that you want to talk about it and hear advices. In my experience, the worst thing an INFP could do is reject others' opinion. I think seeking out other people's point of view of things is the best first step you could have taken!\n\nWhat you're describing seems awfully similar to a Si loop, or the start of one... You feel trapped, as if nothing will ever change. But it's not always the case! I know it might seem weird for an ISFJ to say that of all things hehe but change is your best friend. Just because things have been like this for a long time doesn't mean they won't change! In fact, things keep changing around us, all the time! Even you as a person, are bound to change. You're no failure! So what if you've failed before? You will learn from it and get better.\n\nSo things will change, but you have to take baby steps! If you try to change things too suddenly, you might overwhelm yourself in doing nothing. I would advise you to try out new things to find yourself a new lifestyle that you like. Maybe try deciding on one thing to do that week, such as cleaning the apartment, or going to buy groceries! (I know cleaning doesn't sound fun at all but once your apartment is clean you feel like a new person). You have to take care of yourself for things to change, and those are things that are important for your body! \n\nYou don't have to ask too much of yourself, but it's a good thing to try and do things, even if you start slowly! I've found that if you put too many things on your to do list for one day or one week, you will most likely end up procrastinating, so it's best to start small, even if you feel like it's dumb. Try it out until you find a routine or lifestyle that fits you and makes you happier. One advice I would give would be to try and get up early (not too early hehe) everyday. It might be hard at first but it makes you feel like you have so much time to do things! So it can be really motivating and good to help feeling like a failure! \n\nIt's important that you try out new things as well! It's really nice that you started crocheting. Try new things often such as going for a walk, going to see a movie (even on your own!), drawings things, etc. Go out and sit in a park with a book on a sunny day! Find what you enjoy doing. Discover a little bit more about yourself!\n\nAs for the future, it is completely understandable that you would feel so overwhelmed. It's really tough trying to figure out what you want to do with your life. But as I said, you're no failure and you won't always be failing. \n\nVery few people know what they want to do that early in life. It's very common for people to try out something and then discover that it was not their path at all! It's ok to go out there and try things and "fail". It's not wasting time, you're figuring things out. Take your time. Start vague: instead of thinking of jobs, think of fields, think of your favourite subjets! I think we tend to try and find a job right away, which is a mistake because we don't know all the kinds of jobs there are out there! Do you like literature? Study literature! Once you learn more about it, you might find a job you like. And if you realise you don't like literature that much after all but you're kinda into law? Try out law! \n\nLife is full of opportunities and sadly (my Si dom heart speaking ahah) you can't have it figured out as you start. If you look at all the things you have to do and figure out, you'll get overwhelmed because it will just seem like it's too much and you'll never have the time nor the motivation! You have to do things step by step without worrying too much about the big picture. It's just like when you're washing your clothes after a month of not doing it. Everthing is so dirty and there is so much to wash. So you should just pick up your clothes and start washing them one by one. Then you'll realise it wasn't as bad as you thought it would be. You might even start seeing the beauty in the little things, such as getting up early one morning and witnessing how beautiful the sky was in the golden morning light. \n\nIn short, it's not about "What can I do?" but about "What do I want?" and "What do I like?". Take your time. Try things out, step by step. Fail if you have to. Go slowly, but always try to move forward :)\n\nSorry if it sounded a bit generic and overly optimistic, I hope you can find some useful information in there! Good luck!
4	First, you need to sit back, take a deep breath (or 5), and look at this logically. If your closest friend was exactly where you are right now, would you be as demanding of or as harsh on them as you're being to yourself? I doubt it. What would you tell them to do? Treat yourself like you'd treat the most important person in your life... because you **are** the most important person in your life. Be kind and gentle with yourself, bud.\n\nNext, I need you to understand something: not very many people are where they think they should be in life right now. Everybody has doubts and has been unsure of where they were going, how to get there, and what to do when they arrived. Hell, I'm 35 and about to graduate college, and I'm ***still*** feeling pretty shaky. 😂 \n\nBottom line? Every single thing that you're feeling and going through right now is absolutely normal, everyone has been through it at some point, and *everything will be okay in the end, somehow*. You'll get where you need to be in life. In the meantime, take care of yourself. Give yourself pep talks. Step outside and breath fresh air. Love who you are right this very moment. Most importantly? Never stop going forward, even if it's just taking baby steps; many baby steps equal a giant leap. \n\nETA: Hey, I'm super proud of you for being brave enough to actually stay with your relative for one day and one night; for people who have acute anxiety, that's a huge accomplishment! Don't look at it as, "Well, I was supposed to stay for 10 days but only managed to get through 1." Think about it like this, "I had the choice to stay home, but instead of taking the easy way out and bailing, I went and actually managed to stay a night. Go me!" **Baby steps...**
3	I am trying to give you some advice and excuse me if anything sounds too obvious. We don't know enough about you or situation to make this really tailored to you. So this can be a bit generic.\n\nFirst you have to try to beat yourself up over things. If you are seeing a therapist maybe they are working with you on a method like CBT to reframe your thoughts? Simply explained it is just a tool to analyse your fears and ask yourself if they are really true and if they have bad, non-reversible consequences. Often times the fear becomes bigger than the worst case. Often bad consequences are very unlikely. Often you can just take action to correct bad consequences if they really occur.\n\nIf you want to read a book about it I can recommend Feeling Good by David Burns.\n\nI am not sure how #1 impacts your life but it seems like it just happened and there is not too much harm done. You tried to do this and you made if for two days. It's ok, try better next time. If your anxiety is too strong maybe you can find something that comforts you like your crocheting. Don't make yourself do scary stuff for a long time. Take resting periods.\n\nI understand the feeling that some problems just appear so big that you can't tackle them like choosing the perfect career for your life. Then you don't get to have any pleasure because most of your time is spent worrying that you don't make progress with the biggest scary item on your to do list. Appreciate yourself for doing something for yourself. Did you eat healthy today? Good job. Did you get some crocheting done? Nice! Did you enjoy it? Yes! Did you make your bed? Great!\n\nTry that. Just make your bed in the morning. Nothing fancy. Just put your blanket on their neatly and you are done. 20 seconds. Then understand that you accomplished this. It is the first thing you have checked off your list for the day. Let's see if we can do one or two more things. But the counter will be at least 1 at the end of the day.\n\n> I feel like I won't be able to hold a job or do anything properly.\n\nThis sounds quite self-defeating. Why do you think that? And wouldn't it be great to have earned some money for a few weeks. It's a success. Also you earned experience. You know if the job is right for you or if you should try something else. You are getting closer to something that works for you.\n\nAlso the good thing about your anxiety might be that you don't want to disappoint anybody and therefore will make an effort to do a good job. People around you will see that make an effort, even if you are still learning and make mistakes.\n\nPlan your week. Your goal should not be to have your dream job at the end of the week that you can stay in for 40 years. Your goal should be to finish your CV OR to send out an application OR to find a course that you could do to prepare yourself for a job OR to talk to somebody about their job. Do you know who has a job that sounds interesting? Ask them if and why they like it or how a typical week looks like.\n\nDon't try to be perfect. Don't try to make the RIGHT choice. Try something and see where it takes you. Life is actually quite long and so much stuff happens. If you keep trying and doing things you will learn what you want, what you are good at and it will lead the way.\n\nGood job for coming here and taking action on making a positive change in your life! Keep going.
33	I feel like everyone I care about is Batman and I'm Alfred	If one sentence defined me as a friend, it's: *"How can I help you, Master Wayne?"*\n\nImo, my major role in their life is to help and assist. The act itself of helping AND receiving their validation from doing so makes me happy. I'm vocal about my disagreements in some of their decisions and ideas, but I will still support them anyway - like how Alfred is vocal that Bruce is crazy for doing Batman stuff and he should stop, yet he still supports him.\n\nAlfred once said, "I will always be here to patch you up." Well, that's exactly what I do. \n\nNow, on those times Batman does something rude to Alfred, Alfred doesn't hesitate to put Batman in his place. One time Batman insulted Alfred so hard that Alfred slapped Batman in the face. They both calmed down and gave each other space, but in the end Alfred was still all "fuck it, I'll still be here for you damn you." That's symbol that if my friends ever directly wrong me, I would be quick to bite them back but I'll still take a bullet from them.\n\nCan anyone relate? What's your stand on this?
5	I like being supportive. It gets tiring sometimes putting everyones' needs before my own, but I'd rather be helpful than be helped... if that makes any sense. 
3	I love your analogy. Its hard to put into words loyalty so strong and worth enduring. 
2	I can relate, I have been playing support all my life. Weird part is that it makes me quite happy.
1	Agreed 100%. My husband is Batman and I'm Alfred.\n\nI might be Alfred but I know a Joker when I see one and would never stick around for long. \n\nLuckily my Batman is a damn good Batman. 
1	Same here, i've always been player 2. The thing is, these recent years i've envied those with more protagonism (player no.1), but at the same time i wouldn't want to be in their position (at least not with my awkward high class social skills).\n\nStill, being an Alfred isn't bad. People rely in you. It's just that, when they don't need help it gets quite lonely.
0	I'm Batman without super buying power.\n\nBut hopefully, I'm not an alcoholic or a drug addict.\n\nAnybody would like to be my Alfred ?
5	ISFJ being a friend to an INFP	Exactly as the title says. What's your experience with INFPs? How do I become a great friend to them? Dos and don'ts? What should I expect? Any warnings? I need everything you know!\n\nThank you!
3	I'm not really sure why, but I just seem to naturally get along very well with my INFP friends. I am always amazed by their artistic talents and whimsical imaginations.\n\nMy advice is the same I would give for being a good friend to any other personality type: be there for them when they're going through the rough patches in life. INFPs are characterized by a childlike, innocent, "head in the clouds" outlook on the world, and sometimes the harsh realities of life knock them out of their fantasy world and leave them in a depressed funk. Those are the times when they need a friend to encourage them and remind them of the value and necessity of their optimism. Without INFPs, the world would be a much darker, depressing place.
3	ISFJ feels\n\nINFP **FEELS**\n\nISFJ does things that kind of make sense and kind of don't\n\nINFP is hanging from the chandeliers in the nude while writing poetry
2	I agree with the other comment completely. INFPs do need optimism and encouragement. Listening to them is also very important, I think. I've been friends with quite a few INFPs. Most of them are really nice and fun! Once they feel at ease with you, they'll tend to open up to you and you can have really deep and meaningful conversations with them while still being able to have lots of fun. \nHowever, I've been friends with some INFPs in loops and grips... In those cases, they tended to exteriorise their bad and depressed feelings on me by being downright disrespectful. In those cases, I would advise you to share your concerns directly and talk to them about what's making you feel like they're treating you badly. It's really important because they may not realise at all because of the Si loop and if you do not tell them when it happens (it's honestly hard for me as an ISFJ), they won't understand when it gets too much for you because "it wasn't the case before." \nThat's my only warning! I was a bit traumatised at first, but thankfully I met other INFPs that were so nice and warm it allowed me to move past those feelings. 
2	As an INFP with an isfj the fact that there's even a subreddit about this tell me you guys are even nicer than us!
1	I’m an INFP male married to and ISFJ female!
3	Signs An ISFJ likes you	I was wondering if you could help me out. I rarely ask for help but sadly i couldn’t figure it out myself lol. Thank you very much. 
11	Two things that I find myself doing subconsciously when I'm attracted to someone:\n\n1. Making an effort to be around them as much as possible, for as long as possible. Calculating excuses to interact with them more often than normal.\n\n2. Acting exponentially more energetic and social than normal. This is huge. Normally I am more reserved and less talkative at social events, but if someone I'm interested in is around, I find myself acting more extroverted in groups (joking and goofing off, telling stories, and generally taking a more active role in conversating).\n\nThese signs of attraction are probably true of most personality types, but with introverts it's a dead giveaway.
7	ISFJs are basically Canadians in that they're super nice to everyone, but if they're triple nice to you – they probably like you. That's as simple as it gets.
5	Look for differences. Are they hanging around you more than they are others or are they talking to you more than anyone else because yes if they are initiating conversations with you that is generally a good thing if they are doing the same with everyone else just as often than they probably don't think of you any different than everyone else. Keep in mind this is true for everyone. For ISFJs especially look for if them trying to spend time with you. We love to be in places that are super lively and conversational so if you're providing that than there is a pretty good chance that they like you.
3	Oh you will know.
7	What are your proven methods to make yourself happy? Mantras? Mindset? Anything!	
3	For me I like getting something done that is not influenced (directly) by external motivation. I will usually get stuff done that is needed to not disappoint the people around me but if there is nothing "pressuring" me it gets a whole lot harder.\n\nThere are plenty of things I am interested in but then I spend a ton of time on research and preparation to make everything perfect instead of getting something done.\n\nTherefore taking the leap to doing something like planning and executing an event (which can simply be game night with friends or whatever), something creative (art, writing a blog post, learning some piece of music) or attending an "event" (sports, cinema, ..) on my own disregarding that nobody wants to join.\n\nI really like if somebody recognizes what I did but I can still be pretty happy and satisfied about myself without it.\n\nThis week I invited some old colleagues of mine to dinner at my place and cooked myself. Quite a bit of prep work but everything went well, people enjoyed themselves and I got plenty of compliments for it.
10	Self identity: you or to please?	Hey all ISFJs :) how do you all deal with the common weaknesses of our personality type? does it bother you that we may tend to be/called 'boring', 'conservative', 'unoriginal', 'reserved'? \n\nIs this something you want to change, or do you embrace it all because these traits are embodied in our personality?\n\nJust young 20yo struggling at the moment :)
2	i try to improve upon the things i find i'm limited by and have learned to be happy to find limitations to improve upon. kind of like "this is who i am now. let's see where i can go now that i know".
2	I say, don't worry about it. My ISFJ mom is really knowledgeable in her area of expertise, and she gets called "intimidating" a lot. She hasn't changed any of the more "boring" parts of her personality, but her confidence is enough to scare people, I guess. Don't change who you are. Just be confident, and the waters will part before you (if my petite, unassuming mom is any indication).
2	Wait, unoriginal? I thought we had a rich inner world? I get compliments about my creativity. I am absolutely a homemaker take-care-of-you type though. 
1	I was aware of my weakness even before I discovered MBTI and honestly they do not bother me at all.
1	Reserved hits home. It has recently caused me a lot of strife. 
1	It doesn't bother me at all except in situations where those traits (mostly the last one) can cause me to be unassertive and not stand up for myself in matters of importance.\n\nOtherwise, I'm fine being boring, straight-laced, unimaginative, unambitious, etc. etc. I live a pretty peaceful, quiet life and I like it that way. Plus, I tend to surround myself with more creative, outgoing people, so I'm a good foil for them.
1	the positive trait we tend to have as caring and selfless actually bothers me more than the negatives, people telling me constantly essentially that my best quality is serving others gets old quick and has led to a lot of my insecurities. Being called unoriginal, reserved, etc doesn't bother me, because i don't really see them as bad things. just parts of myself. 
1	I don’t think these are weaknesses.  It’s how you identify with them.  Reserved to me is I speak when I need to, not whenever a thought pops into my head.  I was at a support group yesterday and a soft spoken person was speaking.  I had a hard time hearing but didn’t want to stop the speaker mid thought(empathy), by the woman behind me is hard of hearing and couldn’t hear anything.  So I interrupted the speaker for the person behind me.  \n\nTo me that’s what my ISFJ role tells me about myself.  I embrace I’ll work hard rather than make someone else do something, or avoid conflict and just adjust my plans.  But if someone needs help, I jump in immediately for them.  If I don’t get ketchup at the drive thru I don’t care, but if my wife’s wit me and she wanted some I go in and get it because she’s more reserved than me.  I don’t know if that helps, but I don’t see the less developed areas as weaknesses, just things to be mindful of. 
10	ISFJ and how do you respond to suicide	I’ve taken the MB twice and always get ISFJ.  I was hoping the second time to read up on my type to find out how to better interact with people.  I lost my twin/best friend to suicide 9 months ago and have been trying to survive this period of my life.  Being introverted and keeping it inside has not been ideal, but I struggle with finding a way to express my the immense amount of grief I feel on the daily.  \n\nThe only person I felt close enough to share my thoughts with would have been my twin who took his life.  My wife has been helpful but the relationship they had makes it difficult to to fully open up to her.\n\nI’m doing grief counseling which helps, but it’s not like having a friend to confide in.  I also do a support group which I am sure most of you an imagine doesn’t help too much.  I speak up plenty for an introvert, I just don’t like sharing what’s really going on inside my head.  I’d rather offer insights to people and help them than share my problems with the group.  \n\nI’ve read a few books, tried to use the experience/knowledge from them but I still can’t seem to get back to normal.  My normal introverted alone time has become a nightmare, usually I do nothing but scroll reddit or wish I had someone I felt comfortable enough to really express myself to.  I probably feel my worst alone which is counter intuitive, I’ve tried journaling to my twin but because of the nature of his suicide it hasn’t been ideal.  \n\nI met a guy who lost his twin the same way ten years ago, and I have met with him a few times.  I find these conversations very helpful but I also feel like I am inconveniencing him since it feels one sided.  \n\nThanks for reading this far.  Just writing out all this has helped.    If anyone has tips for dealing with something like this I would greatly appreciate it.  
6	Hey OP, I don't really have any specific advice, but my heart goes out to you. When I'm struggling emotionally I alternate between isolating and desperately reaching out to anyone I can think of. I think finding a healthy way to grieve is key. Art can be very cathartic. I write poetry when I'm depressed. I have bipolar and have been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts for years. I know it would hugely impact the people around me and I apologize on behalf of people like me to you and everyone who has been impacted by the suicide of a loved one. It's even heartbreaking to me that there's a part of my brain that is like that. Maybe this isn't helpful, but all I can say is I'm sorry. 
4	*virtual bear hug*. I truly wish I had more to offer than that, but I have no idea what that must be like. But I send you deep sympathies from afar (you’re not alone).
1	OP, it pains me to hear that you are going through this situation. I don't claim to be an expert counselor, but here's a few thoughts I had based on my own experiences:\n\nI would encourage you to keep up your conversations with this man who went through the same situation that you are experiencing. I know that as ISFJs, our gut reaction is to assume that we are inconveniencing others; but if this man has already had multiple conversations with you already, that's an indication to me that he is more than willing to help you.\n\nThe worst thing you can do is bottle these feelings up. Bottling up will conceal your emotions for a time, but it won't make them go away. When my grandfather passed away, I bottled up my emotions and didn't seek comfort from anybody. I rationalized this action be telling myself I needed to be strong for my family. But refusing to acknowledge the need to express my emotions and release that pressure did nothing but cause all of those pent-up feelings to burst out all at once 10 months later in a very unhealthy matter.\n\nI guess my point is that it's imperative for you to find some sort of outlet for your frustrations. That's probably gonna be continuing your conversations with this man you met, or somebody else you feel comfortable talking with (friend, family member, minister, etc.). I also highly recommend you take up some kind of new activity to help you take your mind off your worries (I put on a Hardcore History podcast and take a nice, long hike. Whatever works for you). \n\nI suppose the key to grieving is to take control of it. Grief is natural and appropriate, but don't allow it to dictate your life. Personally deciding when, where and how you will grieve will releave pressure and act as the spillway that prevents the entire emotional dam from collapsing.
6	ISFJ career change: TV Producer to ?	I'm 31 years old and have been a TV producer in reality TV for about 8 years. When I've been working, I make incredible money but am absolutely miserable and stressed out all of the time. Trying to bring order and routine to a career path that is always up in the air when your working is impossible. I feel like all the effort I put into the job is a waste of my energy. Being freelance, I'm out of work a lot looking for something new - another job with a new set of responsibilities and challenges. I'm burnt out and need to do something different.\n\nI want to work full time, normal hours, and establish a routine. I did a MBTI test and found that I'm an ISFJ which explains why I've been so unsatisfied while working. I've been suffering from career indecision and anxiety being unemployed the past 3 months trying to figure out what to do next. \n\nAll the jobs that I feel qualified for look like ones that are just going to stress me out for less money, and the rest are entry level jobs that will cut my salary by 50-60%. I rewrote my resume to be more generalized, but all my experience is in TV doing non-ISFJ type responsibilities.\n\nI feel lost and researching all the ISFJ jobs, nothing feels "right" and I'm stuck. Looking for any advice or help from this community. Thank you!
1	Hi! While I was reading your post I imagined myself into your place and really should be a lot stressful passing trough all those years in a career that you can’t schedule anything or be able to wonder what you will have conquered in the next 5 to 10 years. \nSo, getting into your new stage of life, as far as I can see you have two choices: you can try get into an agency in the same area of your previous job, were you would have a schedule and a better perspective; or, you can start over in a new career that fits you better, although the salary is lower than you are used to. You can always start over and see where your strength and effort will lead you, have faith in your self.\nI think will be more useful for you to find your inner peace, clean yourself from the emotional charges that your last job leaved in you and reflect everyday in the opportunities with your mind-opened and heart full of hope and joy for the new life that is out here to come.\nHope I helped you somehow.
1	How about teaching in a related field? 
3	Favorite ISFJ movies?	Hey ISFJs! \n\nI have a movie date with someone I'm 99% sure is an ISFJ. Although tonight is more Netflix and chill, it got me thinking. What movies do ISFJs like? Movies that captivate you and make you want to talk about and analyze them afterwards.\n\nI was thinking maybe the Before series (Sunrise, Sunset, Midnight), Mysterious Skin, Cloud Atlas, Waking Life, Perks of Being a Wallflower. \n\nSo, what am I missing? What are your favorite movies?  \n\nEdit: Thanks for your replies! I have a lot more options for next time now :)
7	> Netflix and chill \n\n( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\nWell my personal favs are anime movies and Star Wars/Harry Potter but I'm just a weeaboo man..
2	spanglish, chef, spiderman 2
1	I came to the conclusion I don’t like any movies at all, they just make me lose time.\nBut when is indispensable to watch, I enjoy more movies who makes me think about life and the people relations, because like this I don’t think my time is being wasted.\nAlthough a few times I like watching non-sense cartoons just to bring a little bright to my days 😊 
1	I have not watched any of the ones you listed, but have heard good things about the last one (the perks of being a wallflower). Maybe I wouldn't go for waking life, it seems it could turn very dense/complicated, although is in my list.\nI love all kinds of movies, but maybe I would recommend for an ISFJ movies with a style like Her or Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. I recently watched "Three billboards outside ebbing, Missouri", which was an amazing movie and it gets you hooked from the beginning, so it may be an option too. 
1	Ok. I wonder if I’m just out the ordinary here, but I love going through horror films if you’re hoping to talk them over at the end and snuggle all the way through. The good ones pose serious personal questions and leave you with resolution, not necessarily closure though. Like the babadook (i get it, it’s controversial) but if you recognize the antagonist as her depression and inability to let go, you can certainly dwell on that for a while. Or many religious horrors ask questions about the nature of God, how could he let this happen type deal. There’s also cosmic horror like The Void, forcing us to broaden our scope of understanding beyond just our petty issues by letting the antagonist reside beyond our mortal and physical plane, with the goal of pulling us out there too. \n\nBut if you’re looking for lovey dovey stuff, there are plenty of romantic comedies to enjoy. Like my BF and I just watched Why Him and I loved it! He’d already seen it and, like any good ISFJ, took the opportunity to snuggle me while watching it on and off making sure that I enjoyed it. \n\nIf an ISFJ wants you to watch a movie they’ve already seen, it’s because they want to be with you. They want to know what parts to gauge your reactions at, when to mimic quotes, when they can nuzzle without missing anything. If you want an ISFJ to watch a movie, they’re gonna be aware of how they would pitch a movie your way and they’re gonna try to be fully attentive to you and the movie at once. If you know what you like and can engage the ISFJ about it, they’ll be all over it and you. You just gotta bring something you’re passionate about and your energy will fuel them.\n\nIf they’re up for it, take your ISFJ through cloud atlas and watch for reaction and realization. I loved that absolute shit out of that mind ‘splosion. 
1	I LOVE The Grand Budapest Hotel. Definitely one of my top 5. I admire the dialogue. 
1	Lord of the Rings, The Matrix, The Godfather, The Dark Knight, Star Wars, Monty Python and the Holy Grail....\n\nI guess I'm not super into "think-y" movies. Probably the one that comes closest to that would be Inception.
1	I'm more of a horror junkie, buuuut...\n\nIn the past few years, movies I've watched that have really stood out and had me pondering for a few days: "Room" and "Inside Out!" I cried through at leat half of each of those. \n\nEDIT: Realize this thread is 14 days old... meh, choices for next time ;P
3	What does this email from my ISFJ partner mean?	My partner is ISFJ and I have a hard time interpreting what he’s thinking, so I’m asking for some perspective from like minded people.\nHe has some ideas of “closeness, intimacy and warm family bonds” that I find I am unable to live up to as a partner. He’s always on about how we aren’t close enough, intimate enough, and it’s serious enough to him that he’s moved out.\n\nWe have been together for five years, living together for three years. We have a toddler. Well, we are splitting, his choice. This past weekend,  I guess he has some spare time in his new place, because he started answering emails, which he almost never does, and he somehow discovered that I use Facebook, and that I’ve done so for years. \n\nThis is what he wrote to me in an email:\n\n“... I realized that you have an entire separate life you're sharing on Facebook with your friends, pictures and comments going back many years, and I'd never seen any of them until today. Precious pictures of our toddler even comments from my own family members that I have never seen, strange. This strikes me as really odd and a bit disturbing. It's not that your posts are disturbing, but what bothers me is now discovering that you are in this whole other world -- Facebook -- and I simply had no idea of the degree you used Facebook.\nIt seems to me that we've been leading separate intimate lives for so long and I never knew  -- you share your important photos and thoughts on Facebook -- and I had not seen any of them until now. It makes me feel very sad because it's clear we're apparently so different in the way we communicate with family and friends....”\n\nSo now Facebook has gone and depressed him. I’m flummoxed. He’s a friend on my Facebook, so is a lot of both of families and I post regularly for everybody, and they reply.  It’s like he thinks I kept Facebook secret from him, and posted. He seems to forget Facebook is a public forum, which he is part of and so is a lot of his family. \n\nActually he’s the one who never ever logs into social media. He’s very bad at keeping track of things and answering emails, texts, never uses other social media either. He’s very much an introvert who values his alone time in his office with his podcasts.\n\nSo, the way I think, if I had found something like that, I would think it’s great, a treasure trove of cool and memories, and comments from people, freely available. A wonderful trip down memory lane. And if I’ve done something cool that he likes, why isn’t it worth a thumbs up. And if I’m so different from him in how I communicate, why doesn’t he think that is awesome too?\n\nIt’s been a real problem for me, that in this relationship, I could never live up to the ideals of “closeness and intimacy” he has in his head. And that he puts all the responsibility on me for failing to do this, without considering my perspective, that I am an independent type of person (I am ISTP). It seems he is consumed by his own perspective.\n\n It just seems that this is another example of how I don’t measure up, and he doesn’t consider my general good intentions.\n\nI hope, ISFJs, you can give me an idea of what is running through his head.
4	Would he be willing to see a therapist? I think these sorts of issues would be better resolved if you both could see the other's point of view in a safe, non-judgmental space and work toward understanding how the other thinks. Misunderstandings in communiction don't have to be the end of a relationship, and compared to other issues (like addiction, conflicting values, etc.), they're ~relatively~ easy to work out. I'm sorry this isn't more helpful, but please don't give up hope.
1	That's the old divide concrete/virtual. My closest ones have no idea how much I write on Reddit. They are just worried about the time I spend on it.\n\nAnd even though I tell them I value personal secrecy, and I'm aware all I'm writing here is public and common property, they still think it's some intimate part of my life they have nothing to do with.\n\nThey take cultural and linguistic barriers as backup for their beliefs.\n\nI'm pretty sure that's what's going on for your ISFJ, and there's nothing to do about that. One can't learn about the Internet culture in a snap, especially if they don't acknowledge there's a culture of it's own right in a first place.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe you know about his cultural references, though. If he can't meet you where you are, how about you meet him ?
1	His behavior is somewhat disconcerting. Could it be that he is having an affair or found someone else?
7	ISFJs and Drinking Anxiety	Hey everyone. I'm an ISFJ male who's been in a relationship with an ENTJ female for the past few months, and all in all, things have been going very well. Even though we are undoubtedly *extremely* different in how we approach problems in our daily lives, we both find our difference in perspective to be enriching and complementary, covering each others' flaws. But in all this there is one thing that we haven't seen eye-to-eye at all, and that's on drinking alcohol (well, high-risk behaviors in general, but alcohol being the most frequent topic.)\n\nFor context, I'm the type of person who is very rules- and experience-based in my approach to drinking. I did not start drinking until I was 21, and even then, my tolerance is extremely low, often leading to bad experiences with alcohol, even when I was careful. Lately I have gotten much better at holding my drinks, but to this day I really do not see the appeal of drinking at all, and thus limit drinking only to special occasions (maybe once or twice a month).\n\nOn the other hand, my ENTJ girlfriend drinks reasonably often (typically between 1-3 times a week). That said, she is extremely responsible with her drinking - she's never felt ill from drinking, nor have any major issues arisen as a result of her drinking. And yet, every time she drinks, I find that I'm beside myself with worry, even though she's never done anything to warrant it. Lately I've expressed my concerns, but she insists that I not worry about her drinking habits. I totally understand that I shouldn't be worried, but I find myself always getting anxious about her drinking, even though it's not my responsibility. I don't want my own fears to get in the way of our relationship, so I know that I need to change.\n\nWhat I want to know is if anyone else has gone through this before, and how you deal with anxiety in general. How should I go about getting over my fears and letting my girlfriend live her life the way she wants? As it stands, I don't want my anxiety to potentially get in the way of her social life...so, thoughts?
3	I understand your concerns. Im not much of a drinker myself\n\nTo be honest, as far as I see, as long as she doesnt like force you to drink and hasnt like physically or psychologically  harmed you while drunk you should give her a chance\n\nIf actual problems pop up then thats an issue, but for now just trust her, its only been a few months
3	This has been an issue in my relationship as well. My husband does struggle with alcohol issues, but it’s easy for us as ISFJs/light social drinkers to worry even when we don’t need to. \n\nEven though it sounds like your girlfriend drinks responsibly, you may benefit from attending Al-Anon meetings. These meetings are support groups for friends and family of alcoholics and can help you maintain good boundaries and offer support without creeping into codependency. 
2	Because my parents both drink and mom has been a bartender my whole life, I spent about 1/3 of weekends as a kid in a bar. I'm not a fan of the bar environment and I get the anxiety part; my mom likes to drink/party away her depression and anxiety.\n\nAs long as your girlfriend keeps it in check, you guys should be ok. I saw a friend who sounds a bit like your gf marry someone like you and they're about to celebrate 2 years.
4	Questionnaire for Introverts	Hi ISFJ fellows! \n\nMe, as an ISFJ created a questionnaire which concerns training programs and would be useful for my research.   \nI would like you to ask to fill it out, it does not take more than a couple of minutes.\nI appreciate it in advance!\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe9377aVHzGIbVzJ0ppib8zVEPUk-ACrF4XaWgkFUF0fm1stw/viewform?usp=sf_link\n\nThank you so much!
1	I'm not sure what you mean by question 2
1	I filled one out, I'm an infj though
1	Book Suggestion	What novel do you think an ISFJ would like? I’m trying to help an ISFJ get back into reading, so I think one that’s not too long, one that picks up quickly, and one that’s very enjoyable/rewarding would be good.
1	I don’t know if a preference for genre is defined by someone’s Meyers Briggs classification. I almost exclusively read fantasy and my tastes in this run the same as my INTP husband. \n\nHow old is this person? What have they enjoyed in the past?
16	Stereotypical ISFJ question, but I actually am genuinely curious...baking and ISFJs???	So, there's this stereotypical idea of the ISFJ being a grandmotherly type...making warm cookies and knitting sweaters and you know. It's a joke, but...Seriously, do you guys have any good cookie recipes because I'm awful at following directions as an INFP. I cannot bake. \n\n**PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY I LOVE ISFJS AND REALIZE THIS IS A STEREOTYPE YOU'RE ALL WONDERFUL AND BEAUTIFUL PLEASE KEEP BEING YOU. THE WORLD NEEDS YOU ALL SO MUCH.** *Also, I am actually being serious..I need a good recipe.*
5	I mostly fit the stereotype, honestly.\nI'm like the stereotypical ISFJ 1950s housewife in so many ways.\nCooking, cleaning, sewing, nurturing, the whole shebang.\n\n\nI don't bake super frequently, mostly if I have a family dinner, holiday or occasion, and I'll bring a dessert of some kind. But it does come pretty naturally to me.\n\n\n[Here's my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. It hasn't let me down yet.](https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/ultimate-chocolate-chip-cookies/77c14e03-d8b0-4844-846d-f19304f61c57)
5	I am awesome at cooking but terrible at baking. Baking is just too strict for me, you can't just "feel" the recipe out, otherwise it won't turn out. \n\nSorry this doesn't answer your question at all. :p
3	I bake... once every half a year LOL
3	I loooove baking. Absolutely hate cooking though. I find baking very relaxing, practical (ie: all the ingredients are precise) and a great use of energy. Plus in the end I've made something everyone can enjoy
2	here are the cookie sections of two places i look at for food ideas:\n\nhttps://sweetdreamsrecipes.wordpress.com/category/cookies-and-bars/\n\nhttps://rachelhowdenblog.wordpress.com/category/food/cookies/
2	It depends on how you like your cookies.  I'm a "soft and chewy" guy myself.  The Martha Stewart recipes are pretty solid.\n\nSoft and Chewy:  https://www.marthastewart.com/344840/soft-and-chewy-chocolate-chip-cookies\n\nThin and Crispy:  https://www.marthastewart.com/343950/thin-and-crisp-chocolate-chip-cookies\n\nDepending on how you deep down the cookie rabbit hole you wanna go, here's a good article that helps explain how to adjust a recipe to get what you're after:  www.handletheheat.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-chocolate-chip-cookies/
2	I was never good at cooking or baking because... I never tried it before, or barely did it. Si is also all about personal experience so I think an ISFJ can be clueless about it if their Si never got involved in it.\nLately, I tried baking and I've been loving it. Baking for others feel great so I guess that allows me to engage with both Si and Fe. \n\nAs for the cookies... Well, I usually look up for receipes online and their reviews hehe (but they're in French so I can't share, sorry...). You can try a few and decide what works best for you and then go wild! Good luck on the cookies! 
2	INFP needing help and support.	What advice do you have for an INFP who is struggling badly with severe mental health issues, but doesn't know what to do or how to do any self-care/won't let others take care of them? 
2	You know how to cook or take a shower, at least, right ?\n\n**That** is self care. Do the laundry and clean your home, and you'll have the actual basics.\n\nIt's really about taking care of your basic physical needs, so the way you do that don't much matter as long as it's done well. You need dishes done, not a dishwasher, after all.\n\nThe other half of that advice that may interest you far more is how to deal with doing those tasks even though they are unrewarding for everyone.\n\nIt's about discipline. You schedule a time to do those tasks, and do them no matter what, until it becomes automated and systematic.
2	Big 5 Correlations? (x-post from r/INFJ)	Edit*\n\n##[Results Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/89k2lv/big_5_correlations_results/)\n\n-------\n\nHey there, ISFJs! I'm a mod over on r/INFJ and we've been doing this experiment to see if there are any Big 5 correlations between MBTI types. So far I've got input from INFJs and ENTPs, and it's going so well that I wanted to ask you all next (I've also asked the INFPs just today, too)! I promise to come back with results if I get enough people to participate :) Just state your type and your % scores for each Big 5 category (and feel free to add anything else from your results if you want to share). Thanks in advance!\n\n-------\n\nThere is a lot of talk regarding MBTI vs [the Big 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) - [is MBTI as valid](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/08/02/what-is-the-current-thinking-about-myers-briggs), do they correlate ([1](https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/13460/what-correlation-research-has-been-done-on-mbti-vs-big5), [2](https://personalityjunkie.com/09/openness-myers-briggs-mbti-intuition-big-five-iq-correlations/)), etc. I thought a community post would be a good way to see what kind of distribution we have when we compile INFJ results. With enough participants, I'll report back the distributions and see what shakes out :)\n\n##[You can take the Big 5 test here](https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test)\n\n(it's free, the $29 "cost" refers to the cost of their premium report, and you also don't need to create an account to see your results, just click "no thanks")\n\n**Please comment here with your type (let me know your type so we're not mixing results) and the percentages for each Big 5 category.**\n\nBelow is an overview of the Big 5 for those who are unfamiliar.\n\n-----\n\n[*From wikipedia:*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits)\n\n> * **Openness** to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)  \nAppreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity and a preference for novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine. High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus, and more likely to engage in risky behaviour or drug taking. Also, individuals that have high openness tend to lean towards being artists or writers in regards to being creative and appreciate the significance of the intellectual and artistic pursuits. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven—sometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor.\n\n>* **Conscientiousness** (efficient/organized vs. easy-going/careless)  \nA tendency to be organized and dependable, show self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior. High conscientiousness is often perceived as stubbornness and obsession. Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability.\n\n>* **Extraversion** (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)  \nEnergy, positive emotions, surgency, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extraversion is often perceived as attention-seeking, and domineering. Low extraversion causes a reserved, reflective personality, which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed. Extroverted people tend to be more dominant in social settings, opposed to introverted people who may act more shy and reserved in this setting.\n\n>* **Agreeableness** (friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/detached)  \nA tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and whether a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentativeness or untrustworthiness.\n\n>* **Neuroticism** (sensitive/nervous vs. secure/confident)  \nNeuroticism identifies certain people who are more prone to psychological stress. The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, "emotional stability". A high stability manifests itself as a stable and calm personality, but can be seen as uninspiring and unconcerned. A low stability expresses as a reactive and excitable personality, often very dynamic individuals, but they can be perceived as unstable or insecure. It has also been researched that individuals with higher levels of tested neuroticism, tend to have worse psychological well being.\n\n[*From a peer-reviewed paper:*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886996000335):\n\n>The NEO-PI Agreeableness score was correlated only with the thinking-feeling (T-F) dimension; the NEO-PI Conscientiousness score was correlated with both thinking-feeling and judging-perceiving (J-P) dimension; the NEO-PI Extraversion score was strongly correlated with the extraversion-introversion (E-I) dimensions, while the Neuroticism score from the NEO-PI was not related to any MBTI subscale score. The openness dimension was correlated with all four especially sensing-intuitive.

15	This Is What Triggers Your Anxiety Based On Your Myers-Briggs Personality Type	
2	I would disagree with the INTJ one. Planning for the potential of a disaster would be part of any good plan. Assuming we think of all the possibilities, that also includes the potential of a disaster thus it would already be taken into account.
1	back at it again with that Fe = helping people bullshit? ENFJs aren't even selfless 
1	lol the ISTP one is bs 
6	Here’s What Kind Of Boyfriend You Are Based On Your Myers-Briggs Personality Type	
5	that article is cancer 
1	INFJ would freak me the fuck out. :P
10	How often do you cry?	Does it typically help? Why? What makes you cry? 
23	Often.\nCrying is basically my default reaction to any emotional situation, which is frustrating.\n\n\nSad? I cry. Stressed? I cry. Frustrated, sleep deprived, angry, happy, overwhelmed, laughing too hard? I cry.\n\n\nIt's not something I'm really able to control, but usually I can at least keep it under wraps until I'm not in public. 
14	Not too often but when I do, it’s usually because I feel like others aren’t listening to me or aren’t considering my feelings in a situation.
8	Very rarely to be honest. The main cause is usually a sad or touching movie or something else I'm watching, like a TV series. Last time it happened was I think few years ago.
6	Pretty much whenever I get the feeling and I'm not in public, crying is healthy but it's not good to break in to tears when you're sitting at work.  \n
6	I'd probably cry more often if I didn't get so desensitized to negative emotions. But when I do my mind is pretty sharp the next day. But it's hard to get myself to let it out. 
4	Almost never which is why I sometimes question if Im ISFJ since while im emotional I rarely cry cuz Im too calm
3	I can cry very easily. I would say once a month something can make me cry. I also use it as a release/soothing mechanism, I don't see crying as a bad thing. Things that can make me cry: movies, music, injustices, stress, being hungry and sleepy at the same time, having to confront someone (for example my bosses at work, I try not to cry if I have a conflict but my voice trembles..,), being sick and uncomfortable/with pain... Good thing is I also cry easily when I feel very happy, which is the best sensation. 
1	I don't cry often at all. I cried at my grandmothers passing a few months ago, but that was just at the shock of it and because the rest of my family was crying. Before that, I probably went about four or five years without crying. 
1	A lot. Like just today at least 3 times and it's only lunch time. Anything can trigger it...a thought, a picture, a sad news caption. I cry for every emotion and it's super annoying because Im at my desk at work. Lol. \n\nI'm sure right now my 9-10 year old daughters think I'm some kind of weak sauce because they've seen me cry way too much. My husband doesn't understand either. \n\nI recently found out I was an ISFJ and I'm now trying to figure myself out...only took me 34 years to try.

7	Dear ISFJs, what annoys you about INTPs?	Hi, so I'm an INTP daughter, looking to better myself, so I can get along better with my ISFJ mom. I have a lot of trouble putting myself in her shoes. She cares about me a great deal, but we still butt heads cause we're two very different people. So, what don't you like about INTPs? And how should I communicate with an ISFJ? I try to give her affirmation, but maybe not enough.
10	Lack of sympathy and genuine interest in other people's lives is what annoys me about INTPs. Ask your mom about how things are going and have follow-up questions. Show that you care about whatever struggles, accomplishments, etc she's having in life. Be there for her when she needs help or comfort.\n\nISFJs also like to be appreciated. Show that you care and are grateful for the things that your mom does for you.
5	In an attempt to be honest (which I dont mind generally) sometimes INTPs are really blunt/condescending sounding.\n\nI guess I like seeing when people watch what they say or how they say it
3	My intp best friend of over a decade is incredible. However, from experience and considering what it may be like as an isfj mom to intp daughter (especially while your Si/Fe aren’t yet fully developed), I see a few challenges. First, consider she may not want a solution to some things, just a listening, loving ear (but as an older isfj she may appreciate the Ti/Ne solutions, but it’s likely challenging as a mom/daughter combo). Second, please be gentle in pointing out her logical inconsistencies. I’m bringing Socionics into this one. Pointing out our third (Ti) function is flawed (your dominate), is a huge point of insecurity for us. In theory, as we get older, we want to be good at Ti (I can see this in myself). But being in the tertiary, we’re not as good as we would like to be. \nHope that helps even a little!
3	Intuition	Hello, I am an INTJ in a relation with an ISFJ partner and we have been together for 10 years. Sorry just wanted some context to be established.\n\nNow then, I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to get her to trust my intuition more. She usually will reply with things like “you don’t *know* that” or my personal favourite “booshit” haha.\n\nIntuition is just so abstract and I guess sensor types don’t like that? I’m don’t know.\n\nThanks for your time and input.
4	That stinks. I'm an ISFJ and all about that shit. That being said, don't try to use MBTI or psychology during times of duress, it usually never works on ISFJ's. \n\nAs far as getting her to trust your intuition more. It just has to be perceptually right more than not. Relating your intuition to something concrete will be a load more helpful. Lastly, don't overdo the conceptual thinking, meet in the middle. \n\nHope that helps.
3	Isfj's usually have a really high intuition of our own, but because we're heavily logic-based, we tend to dismiss others intuition because we don't think they're as observation as us. I know it sounds contradictory, but ISFJ's are this weird grabbags of juxtpositions. 
2	Wow my ISFJ husband is the same way, he never believes me and yet and I usually am right. He gets tired of hearing me talk about mbti as well
1	I’d also like to add she hates it when I talk about psychology and anything involving mbti for that matter. And god help me if I try and psycho analyze her thought process. 
1	So, my best guy friend is an INTJ and I'm an ISFJ female. He thinks that way too, but one thing that really helps me "get" what he's saying is that he always backs up his thoughts with logic/facts. Just explaining *why* you think something is the way it is really helps me understand. \n\nOften, INTJ and I have similar conclusions, but go about our "thought" processes in very different ways. When he says something very vague, I always ask him *why* or to explain what he means in further detail. 
1	Pick-up an orange, and ask her what's inside and then ask her how she knows that even though she's never been inside that orange.  Same thing.  INTJ shows a strength in 'Introverted Intuition' which basically means that you pay attention to and draw from past experiences, but usually the little things that most people miss.   Her equivalent is 'Introverted Sensing' which does the same thing only with memory instead. \n\nMy wife is an ISFJ and she can tell me how many dogwoods are in my neighborhood and what color everyone's door is because she loves real estate.  It's just how her brain works.
1	Sensors only care about the tried & true. Nothing metaphysical
0	ISFJ Gives into Kid	I have an ISFJ mom, and she’ll eventually give in to my sister asking for her to undo her punishment, and she’ll seem kind of hurt on the inside but behave in a childish way about it on the outside. Why is this so?
1	She probably feels like a push over because she is...
7	INFP with ISFJ friend. Please help.	Guys, ok, I legit do need help. I have a friend who is an ISFJ and she's sweet and kind and stuff, but holy hell is she an emotional basket case. I like her and I want to be friends and stuff, but she kind of... glommed onto me? I get stuff in the middle of the day that goes something like this: \n\nHer: omgomgomgomg I messaged Jake 2 hours ago and he hasn't gotten back to me yet. I think he's ghosting me. \n\nMe: It's the middle of a work day. He's probably just busy. \n\nHer: *goes on a really, really long rant about all the "signs" he's been showing that he's been pulling away, even though she's only known him for about a week at this point*\n\nMe: Nah, you're just over thinking it.\n\n*2 Hours Later*\n\nHer: He messaged me back \n\nNext day: SAME EXACT CONVERSATION\n\nAnd I understand that she's not the most secure person and I'm not trying to be unfeeling, really I'm not, but this is actually exhausting. I flinched this morning when my phone shot off a notification. I know I need to say something to her, but she's sooooo sensitive and I don't want to hurt her feelings. I do want to stay friends with her, but I need space and I need to not be her emotional crutch all the time. Please advise. 
3	She sounds like me, lol. And no therapy won't help. I just ended up paying my therapist $150 a week to listen to this sort of thing. (She's ENFP and my sister is INFP.)\n\nBut I think you're wrong in her treating you like an emotional crutch. She really just has all these thoughts and feelings and needs to let them out. She doesn't really want your help other than being a sounding board. Any advice you give won't be useful to her cause she'll just do what she wants anyway.\n\nSo yes if you want fewer messages from her, you'll just have to tell her that. Or start responding less and she'll adapt or ask you what's wrong. Trust me, the last thing we want to be is an inconvenience.
5	Tell her to see a therapist, seriously. She's going to ruin all of her relationships if she keeps it up. Imagine how destroyed she'd be if Jake dated her, got to know her, and then decided to leave her. If I were you I'd show her Jordan Peterson videos, make her practice basic social skills. Toughen her up, she can't afford to have that be her norm, shes going to implode from normal life happenings. Maybe tell her to get a dog and to make sure to train it WELL. watching Youtube videos, not her own way; she'll turn that dog into a nervous yapping wreck if she does it herself.
4	INFJ and ISFJ Interaction (Marriage, Communication, S v N, and Tea Towels)	
57	Hey guys, ENFP here. Here's a friendly reminder.	You don't have to have your shit together all the time. It's okay to vent, go crazy, have a nervous breakdown, or have a cathartic release. More importantly, it's okay to share how you're feeling with other people. You're not letting anybody down. You're some of the most kind, caring, and responsible people, but even you should get to be human sometimes. Nobody will judge you if you need to let everything out. It's good to set a good example for others, but it's impossible to do so all the time, because you're human too. It's okay to have flaws and insecurities, and holding them inside you is a lot more harmful than confiding in your loved ones about how you're feeling. 
5	My friend's an ENFP and he would definitely say this to me lol\n\nAnyway, thanks for this! :-)
2	"It's good to set a good example for others, but it's impossible to do so all the time, because you're human too". \n\n:( yeah, i'm human too. can't keep overloading myself.
1	Yeah thanks for the reminder. I definitely have a problem with holding everything in and I’m trying to get better at venting out my emotions.
1	Day made. \nIve needed some positivity and appreciate your thoughts. 
1	My SO constantly overloads and over extends herself for others to the point of literal exhaustion. How do I get her to stop? It’s not healthy, you just can’t save everyone.
32	Socially drained from people who talk a lot?	Do any of you guys become instantly socially drained and develop a headache after talking to someone who talks a lot? 20 min into the conversation and I’m ready to end it so I can retreat to a quiet place to recharge. This didn’t use to be a problem for me but I feel like as I’ve gotten older, I’ve become more and more itnroverted. 
17	Sometimes it’s draining, but sometimes when I don’t know them well it’s nice because I don’t have to struggle to think of things to say. 
8	YES! Especially people I don’t know well. All I want to do is go home, read a book or watch tv - alone!
5	Might sound a bit harsh but if I'm not really interested in what the other person is saying then I definitely do.  In fact I have to hide yawning as it saps my energy. Also find it hard when the person doesn't give you time to speak and talks over you (not always in a rude way but it just feels a bit suffocating).
4	If I'm really comfortable with that person, I wouldn't mind listening to them talk. Awkward conversations/conversations with people I don't like are a different thing though. Sometimes I'm the one who talks too much because I'm just too naggy and I overexplain everything!\n\n\nI do feel drained after being with super enthusiastic and talkative people though, just that it usually has to involve me hanging out with them for 4/5 hours before I feel tired.
3	It depends how interesting I find the convo - some people just talk and talk and talk about nothing and I find that draining tbh.
3	Depends on the person sometimes and how interested I am but I tend to get drained after awhile. I always feel bad because I have troubles keeping focus once I realize how drained I feel. 
3	This is exactly how I feel now as I’ve gotten older. When I was younger, I wouldn’t have felt any social situation would’ve been exhausting...
2	It depends on the person and the conversation. Deep conversations are great. Fluff conversations are draining. Though recently I met someone who I had a deep.conversatiom but she uses... Fluff talking points. Or something. I'm not sure yet but something was not completely genuine in how she talked. And that was draining as well.
6	What ISFJ has married another ISFJ?	Looking for success stories!\n\nWas it difficult being with someone so similar to yourself? Or easier?\n\nHow long have you been in a relationship?
2	I’m married to an ESFJ but she has been feeling more introverted as we’ve grown closer. Been three years now with several years of dating.  We’ve talked through a weeks routine and it works really well. Monday is a reflection day after work to chill and be together. Tuesday evening is all to me. Wednesday is our clean up the house day, Thursday is her night. Friday is date night, social gathering or another chill night. The weekend is for family and having down time.  I’ve grown to appreciate the social aspects of being with her and building great friendships with our circle of friends but I do know when my battery is low and I need my alone time. 
14	ISFJ perfect life for guys- how?	Hi, I recently just found out that I am an ISFJ. Reading the description about it, it is completely 100% relatable for me.\n\nWell here is a little background of me. Since high school, I have always been quite social and knows a lot of people here and there but I don't really have a deep connection with anyone even my few best friends. Not that I don't enjoy their company, but something is definitely missing from it. For example, like when we are in a group of 3, 2 of my friends will be very compatible with each other and I will mostly hear them talking and only sometimes participate in their conversation. Most probably, this is because I don't really open up with anybody (I can't and mostly I don't know what bothers me the whole time). But still I am very grateful to have them in my life, but at the same time I feel like something is wrong with me.\n\nNow that I am in uni, same thing still happen to me that I think would change. I met people here and there and made some very close friends too. People around me said I am a kind and genuine friends because I really like to help people. But still, I am always out of chemistry with anyone when things started to get personal. I never want to let my problems spilled to others as it will make me somehow vulnerable. Things I hate is that people took me for granted like I didn't matter like almost invisible sometimes.\n\nAll the traits that ISFJ have really reflected on me. Sometimes I feel like I don't want to be such a sensitive person, you know just like the person that doesn't give a shit. Sometimes I feel like I don't need to have approval from others. Sometimes I just want to be a carefree person and do whatever the fuck i want without any hesitation. With this things revolves around me, everything really seems unpleasant to me. (friends,relationships, careers etc.)\n\nThen again, I really only want to be the person to easily express my feeling and not be easily taken granted of. So I am just wondering if anybody here has been in this shoes before, and how did they go against this natural personality?\n\nTLDR ; I feel like crap being too available for everyone and being taken for granted most of the time even actually I did it genuinely. I hate this conflicting stuff about me that wanting to have approval from others as well as genuinely helping them at the same time. Most of my friends seems unnatural around me (or I might have overthink this). How would you go away around solving this issue?
14	i have had the same problems. and i've come to completely change how i handle my self image and how i deal with people. best i can explain it is with metaphors, please bare with me.\n\nmy heart can be really sensitive. so i want to guard it from hurt. i fear building relationships because that requires me to expose it to people. and i've been hurt before. so i want to put my heart in a cage. a really sturdy one where only the few people i put through thorough inspection can have access to view it, even touch it.\n\nbut the thing about it is that my heart is sensitive because it doesn't get touched enough. the smallest poke is excruciating and the gentlest stroke is heavenly, because it has been deprived so long from any contact. \n\ninstead i found that if i let it out and understand that pokes and touches are a normal and expected part of living my life, i begin to see that pokes aren't so bad and caresses are nice but aren't as euphoric as i once thought. and my heart isn't as sensitive anymore. my expectations of disappointment, hurt, as well as friendship, and love become more centered and realistic and less on the extremes of pessimism/optimism.\n\nand it allows me to be strong. not the hardened cage around my heart kind of strong which in actuality is isolation and defensiveness to defend a frail heart. but the real kind of strong: no walls, no cage, compassionate yet bulletproof and most importantly free.
5	I have the same issue as you in that I don't easily form deep connections with people and have a hard time opening up. Ive noticed that I have an easier time with people who are INFJ or who are also ISFJ. Idk why that is but I feel more comfortable being vulnerable with people who are similar in personality. I guess I feel like they're more likely to understand and relate to me. 
5	I think you should definitely try to open up with your friends, despite thinking you might be burdening them. Sharing something personal about yourself helps to increase a sense of intimacy with another person, and if you start opening up with them, they will feel permission to open up with you too.
2	I’m new to learning Myers Briggs but I was just talking about this with my s/o yesterday. Even with him I find myself sometimes holding back. The issue was when hanging with his friends I was keeping to myself and never really contributed to the group conversation. This has been an issue even since I can remember though.   I love listening to conversations but I really wish I could break through and connect more deeply with people. That being said though, my best friend is an ISFJ as well and I find myself comfortable with her. 
6	Which subtype of ISFJ are you? Sensory or Feeling?	ISFJ subtypes:   \n    \n**ISFJ-Fe** - Seems lively, friendly, and unrestrained in conversation; emotionally responsive, easily gives compliments and closes the distance, may even take his conversation partner by his hand; his lack of restraint carries a shade of familiarity. Shyness can alternate with joking remarks; ironic quips easily turn into respectful and serious tone. Often jokes and tells even unpleasant things with a smile as to not offend the other person. - [**Full description**](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/12873-Discussion-of-SEI-subtypes-(ISFp)?p=777831&viewfull=1#post777831)   \n    \n**ISFJ-Si** - Calm and soft person in interaction. With his presence often pacifies others. Industrious, practical, does everything with a sense of taste. Often engages in fine arts as a hobby. Well-wishing, tactful, unobtrusive. Tries to sympathize, to assist, to provide advice. Loves rest and comfort. Likes talking about his perceptions and sensations. Attentively questions his conversation partner in regard to his or her affairs. Slightly delayed in his behavior and speech, sometimes stretching out words and with difficulty forming clear thoughts. - [**Full description**](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/12873-Discussion-of-SEI-subtypes-(ISFp)?p=777831&viewfull=1#post777831)
4	What the hell are you talking about?\n\nAn ISFJ with a preference for Fe is an ESFJ!!! Ggggggrrrrrrrrr....\n\n(Maybe subtypes exists but 1. I want that to be demonstrated as oppose to been asserted by fiat and 2. Give the unique names, please!)\n\nEDIT: Rereading this, it gets across my frustration but I don't want it to seem like an attack. So, sorry if it seemed hurtful u/kalinali. If not harm done, grand but just want to be sure. :)
1	My SO is definitely ISFJ-Si
1	The second one for sure
1	Fe... I sometimes dominate the conversation because I want to be grateful and don’t want the person who is with me to feel isolated or like I don’t appreciate their presence being with me.
1	My subtype is Creative (Ne). But just looking at that, Si seems *somewhat*  appropriate.
1	Probably ISFJ-Si
43	Introverts :) Comforting ISFJ	
4	Cute! i love it.
2	Is there an extrovert version?
3	ISFJ guys, how do you see your relationship with women?	Are you satisfied with your relationships?\nWhich strategies do you use to take advantage of being an ISFJ? 
18	I (21 Male) am yet to be in a relationship only because I’m waiting for the right girl in my everyday environment to pursue first. This obviously isn’t very productive since generally guys are the ones who initiate contact, be it at a bar or random settings, but I guess I’m not comfortable in a random pickups, for fear of rejection and since I need to warm a little to a person. As for when I do meet people I like I’ll be reserved a little at first but when I’m sure I really like them, then I would put EVERYTHING into it. (I am fully aware it would hurt more in this case to be rejected than if I asked them straight off, but it’s just the way i am I guess)  I think ISFJs are more one person at a time kind of people, where they plan to stay as life partners i.e. we are suckers in finding the one and we’re all potentially fucked 
7	i am satisfied with my current relationship.\n\ni met a girl and i thought she was really cool. she said something that really clicked with me and that was why i noticed her. normally i observe people but few catch my attention enough to be attracted to or want to spend time with outside of just as friends or acquaintance. dating isn't the most important thing in my life. i have my goals (personal and financial), i have gym, i have boxing. but she won me over.\n\ni got to know her and felt like she liked me too. so i asked her out. when we spend time together i talk about things that matter to me and she talks about things that matter to her. and i feel like over time we know each other really well and that feels good. so we started dating officially.\n\nus easily understanding each other and feeling that kind of connection and belonging and safety with one another gives her an extremely important place in my life. i cut out a large space for her in my time and efforts. and i can't stop thinking about her.\n\ni love her to much and i want to be there for her and help her with her goals and support her because i am happy when she is happy and i want the best for her, in whatever form her dreams/goals/idea of success may be. i want to nurture her and help her and grow old along side her. and all my actions regarding her fall along those reasons/direction. now she is part of my goals.\n\nall she has to do, all that i want and need, is that she loves and cares about me.\n\nthat's how i see my relationship. \n\nthe closest thing i have to a strategy is:\ni understand that the initial puppy love wears out after 6 months to a year. and for a relationship to last we have to be also very close, loving, supportive, honest, open, exclusive best friends with benefits.
3	Strategies for what exactly?
5	A situation I'm in, would like advice and/or if others have experienced this?	Is anyone been in a situation where you\n\n* accidentally been insensitive to loved ones to the point they get really upset with you\n* You gave a wholeheartedly sincere apology and not to make the same mistake again\n* They forgave you and are on normal speaking terms\n\nBut you still feel guilty even 1-2 weeks after the incident + said apology? It doesn't happen often for me but I've been feeling this way recently.\n\nIt doesn't help that they only visit me once a month (I live by myself in an apartment) and I ruined an experience for them while I was here. We're very close otherwise.\n\nI know they appreciate/love me otherwise but I just get scared they'll hate me and/or hold this incident and bring it up every so once in a while.\n\nI feel like this relates to feeling guilty after a mistake and wanting to make it right but at the same time I don't want to go overboard and smother them when they're just the type that just want things to go to normal..
3	It has happened to me too, that I have a remaining feeling of guilt even if all the issue is resolved.\nYou have to realize these anxious thoughts you are having are not of any help, they only harm you, and they are not an accurate representation of reality. What is real is that you apologized, they forgave you and you are still friends and appreciate each other. It is real also that everyone makes mistakes, moreover if they are distressed or having a bad time. So now you are the only one left to forgive yourself and move on. Try to disolve the negative unreal anxious thoughts and substitute them by the positive real facts about these friendships of your. \n \nMaybe the best you could do if you are unable of disolving this thoughts by yourself (I would give it a bit more time though)  is to have a laid-back sincere talk with your friends to make clear everything is solved and they are ok.\n\n
1	>But you still feel guilty even 1-2 weeks after the incident + said apology? It doesn't happen often for me but I've been feeling this way recently.\n\nI never promise it to not ever happen again unless I can give assurances for it. It eases me quite a lot on frustration and guilt.\n\nI remain ashamed of myself, though. And regardless of the pain I caused, even when I didn't caused any.\n\n>It doesn't help that they only visit me once a month (I live by myself in an apartment) and I ruined an experience for them while I was here. We're very close otherwise.\n\n"Ruined an experience for them" ? What it's supposed to mean ?\n\nSounds codified. My mom lives next door, visiting me randomly. We're fine seeing each other on a whim, sometimes for barely the reason of just spending quality time together.\n\nI don't fear disappointing anymore, now it's this way between us.\n\n>I know they appreciate/love me otherwise but I just get scared they'll hate me and/or hold this incident and bring it up every so once in a while.\n\nYou don't have to fear being hated if they truly love you.\n\n>I feel like this relates to feeling guilty after a mistake and wanting to make it right but at the same time I don't want to go overboard and smother them when they're just the type that just want things to go to normal..\n\nWhy not ask them ? You put yourself on a limbo between not knowing how they took it, and being afraid of asking them.\n\nIf they love you, either they'll reassure you if it's a rather mundane mistake, or give you honest feedback on how to do things better next time.\n\nIf they love you, they know any pain you caused wasn't intentional and tied to your character. They'll forgive you and help you to become even more of a good person than you are.\n\nThe hardest is really to forgive oneself.\n\n---\n\nEDIT : Argh. I need to state my legitimacy.\n\n>accidentally been insensitive to loved ones to the point they get really upset with you\n\nI lost the count. My father is supposed to be a loved one, but only hatred and disdain remains in my hear to him. It gives you a good idea of what I'm taking about.\n\nI've been on war my whole early life. Nearly until I became adult.\n\n>You gave a wholeheartedly sincere apology and not to make the same mistake again\n\nI told you that my apologies were really only about asking for forgiveness. I don't say "I'm sorry" anymore because of how much I used to say those words. Forced.\n\nThey lost their meaning to me. That's why I also tell people to apologize only when they do need my forgiveness.\n\nAs the rest is easily forgiven or forgotten.\n\nYou do want to keep that relationship alive, but remember they have to want too, for it to live.\n\n>They forgave you and are on normal speaking terms\n\nWell … As much mistakes done inevitable ends up to weight, in my story. He passively aggressively routinely thrown me scuds and planted traps to my intention, until he did the mistake of taking me to Japan.\n\nHe have been always trying to bend me into a shape I can't assume. There, he realised I was too strong for him to hope that anymore. But he refuses to face who I actually am. He told my mother he'll divorce her because he can't bear me anymore.\n\nThis is his last mistake in his role of a father to me.\n\nI'm not all white, but I don't need his forgiveness anymore. Just bailing out is an option for you.\n\nIt's also why I'm always wondering when people just act like if anything happened. It means a lot to you.
1	the past is in the past. resolutions have been made. all there is now is for new good experiences between the two of you. build new over the past instead of "fixing" what's already been apologized and forgiven for. be a friend, be a good person, be open, and be caring. it's good to be those things so you might as well do them. and being those things will make you and those around you happy. there's nothing more you need to do than that.
33	Big confidence boost after small successful social interactions	Hey guys, ISFJ male here. Does anyone else get a really big social confidence boost after they’ve “done well” in a new social situation and immediately after it feel like they can talk to absolutely anyone in the room? I’m the kind of person who has to gear up in a big social setting by slowly making my way through the room or a table, so if the first few interactions with people don’t go well then I will naturally lose interest in talking to more people and end up wanting to leave. But if it goes well inside i am actually gleaming! I think I get very happy when people are friendly back and must take it badly/personally when not. 
13	As a female, it's totally me as well. I'm always cautious in social situations and then I'll retreat if I feel like an interaction didn't go over well. But if I feel confident and good about an interaction, I feel on top of the world. . Like I could talk to anyone in the room 
11	As another ISFJ male, that's totally me. People often ask me why I'm grinning crazily when I'm talking to someone, and this is exactly why. It's really nice to find someone who you click with.
6	Same here, feel stupidly proud of myself when it goes smoothly.
3	Yep
2	Perfect description 
4	Potentially Weird Question?	I really love ISFJs and think they're wonderful. I would like to have more ISFJs in my life and as my friends. What's the best way to make friends with you guys & are there any specific places that the majority of ISFJs like to go? (Coffee shop, music store, comic store, etc?)
8	I don't know if this has to do with the fact that I am an ISFJ or that I am an English major, but I am almost always in a coffee shop or library. Usually with a book or laptop because I am reading or writing (or on reddit when i should be doing something else). If I'm not alone, I am with one or two other people at most. I don't mind when people talk to me, but I will probably never talk to anyone first. If someone wants to be friends with me it usually helps if they make a definite plan, such as meeting somewhere at a specific time. I don't like when people say "let's hang out" because I never know if it is genuine and I don't want to bug anyone. I hope that kind of helps!
4	All of the places you mentioned are places I like to go, but never hang out for long. I usually don't shop unless I'm looking for something specific, so I won't be at a shop for long. I like hanging out at coffee shops but for some reason I often feel out of place staying there for long. Probably just haven't found the right place. You can also add the library to your list. If I lived closer to one I'd probably visit pretty often.\n\nI need to develop a social hobby; most of my time is just spent at work or home. So I never meet new people and people never have a chance to meet me.
3	To reiterate whats already been said, definitely try and be as concrete as you can about making plans. Effort will go a LONG way. Show them you care, simple as that. 
2	Hmmm the best place to find me when I’m not home 🤔. Most of the time at the grocery store I don’t really go out to coffee shops. Or if not there then out with a few friends at the beach, movies or maybe at the bar. Personally, I like INFPs I have had a sister and friends that are INFPs. I love how deep and empathetic you guys are, I feel like I can be my true self around you guys. 
2	as an isfj, i’m pretty easy to pinpoint because I like to be in a public place (definitely a cafe or bookstore or even the mall) just chilling, almost always alone because I hate the idea of wasting someone else’s time with my idea of relaxation. I would love it if someone made it clear they wanted to be my friend. I like easy plans and being asked questions!
2	To make friends with an ISFJ: be someone that I can talk to about anything. Be there for me when I'm burnt out helping everyone else. Text me out of the blue sometime just to see how I'm doing! \n\nBasically, show me that you genuinely care about my well-being. It might take a little while to reach this point in a friendship; but don't waver, and I'll know that I can trust you with anything.
2	Male ENFP dating a female ISFJ - things were going really well, went exclusive and now she’s going really quiet	Hi everyone. \n\nI’ve recently (about 2 weeks) gone exclusive with an isfj female whom I’d been talking with and dating for about 6 weeks in total. \n\nShe told me she’s never had a boyfriend before but has been great on the first four dates we had. \n\nOn the fourth date, she randomly brought up that she has deleted her dating apps and when I asked her why “she said that she didn’t need them anymore because she met me”. I then asked if we were official and she replied “I don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t be” but asked if I wouldn’t post it on Facebook as she likes to keep things private. \nHowever, since then, she’s gradually got quieter and quieter. We used to message 10+ times a day (good lengthy messages too) and send each regular snaps. \nWe’ve had 3 more dates since the 4th date and spent Valentines afternoon together. On these previous dates, she’s been really quiet but will still talk a fair amount, just a lot less than normal. \n\nShe seems to want to keep seeing me as she said that on her card, but she just keeps getting quieter. Yesterday we sent a total of 2 messages and they were initiated by me (my third message she didn’t even read but was active repeatedly, which is cool with me as I understand she has lots of people to talk to, however, a week ago she would have replied within an hour or two). \n\nI’ve asked her if everything’s okay but she said that she had been quiet but everything was good, then went quiet again. \n\nIs this normal or should I be concerned? Thanks for any help :)\n
1	Sounds like you’re over-analyzing this.  I imagine she can sense that you care this much and it’s just pushing her away.  \n\nYou let her win your commitment so quickly and she got bored... can you blame her?  There’s no fun once you have caught the fish.\n\nToo many red flags for me at this point... I would just go about my thing and let her come to you.
1	OP, any update on your relationship with the ISFJ? How did giving her space and letting her text you first go?\n\nu/muscletown79
2	Si Superiority and How to Deal with It	Any articles or videos on Si superiority and how to deal with people with it?\n\nWhat I mean is people who are arrogant in their Si or are close-minded as a result of putting too much stock in their Si, thinking Si is superior to Ne and Ni and that Si is always right.\nI'm having trouble finding videos/articles on it. I thought it was worth a shot asking here.\n\nI've met people who are confident in their Si, and they're great people, but I've also met people who are incredibly arrogant in their Si, and they're arrogant pricks. They arrogantly think "Tradition is always right. You're an idiot if you even question that." *eyeroll with exaggerated smile*. They look down upon people that don't use Si as their first or second function, and see them as inferior.
5	try r/mbti\n\nEDIT: barring that, the r/INTJ sub is always willing to circle jerk over other people thinking they're superior, and i suspect the INTP and ENTP subs as well\n\nbut yeah on second thought, my ISTJ mother is like this to a t. the biggest example is when I came out to her. she's super conservative, religious, and we don't talk about my sexuality to this day. If and when I have a partner, I'm more than willing to cut her and her bigotry out of holidays, events with any potential grandchildren, the whole works. Not to be nasty, but to protect my partner from it. I guess we'll see if Si continues to uphold tradition when it's preventing you from being in your children's lives.
2	interestingly, I encourage you to bring this to the INFJ sub.  Since Si is damn last in our stack, but conversations are tempered with Fe, you may get interesting anecdotes of Ni vs Si clash without circlejerking.\n\nIn my experience, I've never met Si superiority in Dom position.  the ISTJs and ISFJs I've known (lucky me) are all observant, open-minded, communicative people who navigate the world based on their traditions without feeling like imposing these traditions on others.  It's actually Aux Si (ESxJs) that feels pushy.  I've been told by ESFJs and ESTJs what is "the right way" to do things, often implying I am not, in fact, doing it the right way XDDDD\n\nI don't mind being looked down upon because it doesn't affect me.  I'm secure enough not to feel threatened if someone is being condescending, so really, someone who looks down their nose at me feels more like they're revealing something about themselves that was much better off being hidden.  It gives me a feeling of insight and power to see someone behave that way, because it reminds me that they were probably once a petulant child--and this petulance has only been adapted, not outgrown.
3	Any thoughts about us ISFJs?	
1	I love how warm, kind & supportive you guys are. Usually smart & funny. Seemingly knows what people need before they even know what they need. You guys are so friendly and approachable. Most days you make people feel good.\n\nBut yes its irritating when you guys insist on helping when its not needed and we tell you so. Or giving unsolicited advice. Ya'll can be stubborn & set in your ways.....
2	What got you interested in BMTI and why do you like it?	Hi. I am trying to reach out to people about MBTI. I have found a lot of disinterest and even prejudice from people that don't even know what MBTI is. Some people even think I'm trying to sell something or that that this is some sort of cult. Since ISFJ is one of the most common personalities out there, I'd like to ask you for tips, how to bring this wonderful tool to more great people such as you.\n\nMy question for you is:\n\n- How did you get into MBTI? Were you reluctant / hesitant? What tipped you over...\n- What / why do you like about MBTI? What would you like to say to someone like yourself to inspire them to get involved?\n- Any extra information related to this or ISFJ in general may be of great help.\n\nAny sort of information will help, Anyone's opinion is highly valued! If you know about any articles or posts about this topic, links are welcome. If you are not ISFJ please state that you are not one, or optionally tell what your personality is along with your contribution. Thank you for your help, I wish you all the best.
4	I wanted to understand others better and know why disagreements happen/why people think differently. It has helped me understand why there was so much disconnect with alot of the people around me. \n\nNow I don't tend to think "He/she is doing this to upset me", I think "He/she is an xxxx and so that's why they are doing this". Then it makes it easier for me to see which behaviours are personality differences, and which are just toxic behaviours. \n\nI've made 80% of my close friends take it, and every single person took it without hesitation (to my surprise), and even made their spouses/others take it too! They even enjoy talking about it with me, and allow me to ramble on about functions and what it all means (I love talking about mbti).\n\nIf anything, this has strengthened my relationships somewhat, and give me more understanding about how our relationships work. I love it!

6	Any ISFJ attorneys out there?	Would love to hear from any ISFJ attorneys that enjoy their job and find it to be a good fit. Currently working at a law firm as a corporate/M&A associate and, for a number for reasons (unpredictable assignments/hours/expectations, irrational business folks) have realized this isn’t for me long term. Am wondering if there are any ISFJs out there that have found satisfying attorney work outside of a law firm setting!
2	I’m an attorney working in a corporate law firm practicing in electronic discovery and information governance. I quite like it as there is a project management aspect and I get to work closely with others using my people skills. In my previous job I was practicing civil litigation and I really disliked it. Being in court was really stressful for me because the situations were so confrontational and oppositional. \n\nI would say that in a few years I may want to consider leaving the firm and hopefully practicing in house. The pressure to docket as many hours as possible and the difficult partners can get really stressful at times. I think there have been moments where I’ve thought that I was not cut out to be an attorney, especially as an ISFJ who doesn’t like confrontation. However, I’ve found a niche area that I quite enjoy that will keep me going at least for the next few years at my firm. 
1	My sister is an ISFJ attorney who is no longer practicing law--she has moved into administrative work at a school. \n\nHowever, while she was practicing, she worked in estates and trusts, which struck me as a very ISFJ-friendly field within law.
4	ENTP Guy needs advice with a girl	We're young and in college. She's an ISFJ, I'm an ENTP. Things are good (for now). I need some advice to ignore!
17	ENTP male here who has spent the better part of a year trying to win the affection of an ISFJ female coworker. The fact she's a coworker has kept things kind of slow to develop, however we have a pretty strong friendship at this point. You will learn a new meaning to the concept of "slowly opening up." It will be both frustrating and one of the most beautiful things you ever experience. Here are my top pointers from the ENTP perspective:\n\n1) You will probably be very confused/frustrated by her communication style for a while. You will have to initiate almost all conversations, especially over text/IM. Such is the burden of being an extrovert and a male. If you worry about "bugging her" you'll never hear from her. She's much more worried about bugging you, but the more you initiate with her, the more comfortable she will be with initiating with you. She will likely end text convos abruptly from your perspective. Unlike NT and NF friends who will banter with me over text continuously, if the conversation isn't serving a practical purpose, she will eventually just stop responding. Don't take it personally unless she doesn't respond the next time you strike up a conversation with her. \n\n2) Get used to wildly different behavior when it's just the two of you alone and when you're with other people. Things that she's comfortable talking to you about on a one on one basis will make her clam up if other people she doesn't trust are around. Once again, this can cause a lot of confusion/frustration, because as an ENTP, I'm pretty much super open no matter who I'm talking to, in any context. \n\n3) Similarly...respect her desire for privacy as best as possible and try not to put her on the spot by asking her to do or say something that could cause public embarrassment. \n\n4) My sense of humor runs both incredibly whimsical/silly and incredibly dark and cynical. Try to hold off from the incredibly dark stuff with her, especially if there are other people around. The more over the top, imaginative stuff always gets the biggest laughs from her. \n\n5) Things that help speed up the process of getting her to open up: opening up yourself and being honest to a fault, inviting her to do things (even if she'll say no a lot of the time), writing her a heartfelt card/message on special occasions like her birthday/Christmas, good eye contact, remembering details from your conversations, inside jokes...
2	Well if you're gonna ignore advice here I'll just say you should not talk to that girl and not come on this subreddit anymore.
1	I love the effort you’re putting in, my best friend is an ISFJ and she reminds me of her!!! \nHave fun 
7	Accepting Responsibility	Is refusing to accept responsibility for one's actions and denying the  actions they need to accept responsibility for a phenomenon connected to or correlated with the ISFJ personality type in some way? Keep in mind, I may not be catching things in regards to communication. Although, it's very clear the person refuses to accept responsibility for their actions they deem negative and denies such things.
19	Maybe it's just me but I always accept too much responsibility. I'm pretty sure the phrase I'm sorry is in the top 3 things I say most. 
5	It could just be a general personality trait of someone. Personally as an ISFJ I'm quick to take blame, respond appropriately and apologize. If you look up the ISFJ typing with blame shifting, it's very low. \n\n"Assertive Defenders (ISFJ-A) agreed least of all with the statement (10%). Sentinels would typically never dream of framing someone else for guilt that is their own, and Defenders – quiet, determined, and ready to sacrifice themselves to protect their values and the people they care about – are more likely to accept false blame than to deliver it."
1	Only if I genuinely don't think it's my fault? If I feel that I'm being blamed for something unfairly or judged harshly based on incomplete info or something like that, I think I'm more likely to try to explain the situation or hint that it's not entirely my fault. I can also have some issues accepting authority based on my own perceptions though, so that might just be some lingering immaturity on my part, not considering other perspectives thoroughly enough or not being able to accept something that "isn't fair" even though sometimes that's just part of life. \n\nIf I know something is my fault I immediately accept responsibility, though, and I tend to err on the side of assuming things are my fault unless it's really apparent to me that there's something else going on. It's easier to just apologize and move on most of the time. So I dunno, maybe it's more of a maturity thing than an MBTI thing? 
1	I think you're describing unhealthy SI: \nex. ~Nope, that’s just stupid. I don’t need to consider it, I know it’s wrong.~\n\nDominant SI uses reality for its own established knowledge and experience in order to promote internal stability & integrity of thought and behavior. \n\nThe down side is it can become too reliant on prior experience & routines. This may result in the ISFJ undervaluing or ignoring other peoples ideas & perspectives, or anything else that is deemed disruptive or impracticable in relation to their subjective priorities.\n\nTo other types, over-reliance on Si can look stubborn, fussy, or overcautious....\n\n\n
1	A very unhealthy ISFJ has been floating in and out of my social circle for years. Everything is always someone else's fault and she has no self-awareness so she's completely incapable of taking responsibility for anything. But, like I said, she's very, very unhealthy. Possibly one of the most unstable people I've ever met. None of the other ISFJs I've met have had that problem as they tend to be quite humble.
13	What makes you feel loved?	
39	People paying attention to my needs, reaching out to me first, listening with interest when I talk. Asking me questions about my thoughts or interests, doing things for me to take pressure/stress off of my shoulders, initiating physical contact, checking in on my emotional state. A lot of pretty basic stuff, but it somehow feels like I'm very easily overlooked and always have to ask for those things if I want them, and usually more than once. I've mostly outgrown resenting people for not reading my mind and I know I probably exaggerate the problem, but even so, nothing feels so genuinely sweet and flattering and makes me glow quite like someone paying close attention and showing genuine interest in me. 
13	Little bits of attention given frequently: texting me first, asking how I’m doing, listening to me talk about a long day, a random hug. 
11	Being held. I’m not really a physical being so to say but people just holding onto me affectionately really just butters my eggroll
12	Someone doing something thoughtful to make my life easier -cleaning out my car, doing a chore I hate, small gift that reflects my interests, positive comment on something I've accomplished. 
8	Getting an ISFJ out of a slump	Lately my boyfriend (who is a wonderful, kind, caring person) has been in a massive slump. For privacy reasons I wont get into specific details, but it started with physical health issues and then work issues and then some life issues. I can see him spiraling down into this pit of negativity and it's started to affect our relationship as he is being very closed off and distant. \nI love him dearly and I don't like seeing him like this, but how can I help him get out of this funk? 
8	I feel like at our core, ISFJs want to help people and serve some kind of purpose. Volunteering might meet that need, but without any details I’m not sure what would be the best approach.
4	i'm with k_blz\n\nif i'm in a bad place and somehow i ended up able to help a friend in need, i feel a lot better. or helping someone i care about. or a random stranger. different ways i help people effect me in various ways. but its always positive.
3	Now may be a good time for support and tenderness. Having you to lean on may give them strength to bear whatever they are dealing with. \n\nISFJ’s do things for people to show they care. Do things for them and they will easily interpret that support. Is there anything you can do for their health issues? (e.g. they’re diabetic and you show support by cooking diabetic friendly meals, and you make a lifestyle change in support.) \n\nTake care of some tasks for them so there’s less on their to-do list. ISFJ’s typically like a clean decluttered environment. Clean their house or room. Do the laundry. \n\nTell them what you appreciate about them and what you think others value in them. 
6	How do I get my ISFJ ex-boyfriend back?	I'm an INTP girl. I broke up with him in a rash decision when I was feeling particularly overwhelmed and insecure. Immediately regretted but he stood firm on the decision. The relationship lasted little over 7 months, and while it had wonderful moments, our personalities differences created some communication issues through out. However, I love him, want him back and am willing to work on our problems. He expressed that he wanted us to remain close friends, confidants even, and when asked, he mentioned that he was open to get back together if it happened "naturally". However at the time he didn't have anything else to talk about. We both cried. I was determined to go no contact for a month (it's what all websites recommend to get an ex back), but was kind of shocked that he unfollowed me on social media. I did contact him to ask him for a favor he agreed on before the break-up and he's not responding. Also, he left a few things at my place he said he would pick up but so far he hasn't arranged a time to do it. It's only been 4 days since the breakup, but I want to know what's the best strategy to get him back and start working on it. I would also like to avoid any further mistakes that would push him away him for good. I'd like to at least have him in my life as a friend. Please help!
23	It's over. One thing that ISFJ's don't do easily is to forgive.
4	My wife is ISFJ and as an INTP can feel your pain so-to-speak. I was given forgiveness once and in a moment of clarity/truthfulness my wife, in no few words, said I wouldn't get a second. I've taken that to heart and have learned that "loving someone" isn't enough and there is more to a relationship that just showing up and existing.\n\nYour opening statement causes me a little alarm. I understand impulsiveness, and definitely feelings of insecurity, but maybe using this time not with anyone can help you analyze why you felt overwhelmed. As others have said, the romantic may (but most likely won't) surface but if he is still willing to be your friend use that to learn, both about yourself and the different aspects of your relationship. \n\nI'm not sure if you visit r/intp but behind the self deprecation, memes, and trolls there are some pretty cool people that can offer advice or an ear if you need it. 
3	I'd hate to say it...he'll probably still remain a friend but anything beyond that is gone. It depends on what the breakup was based on. It is not my business but whether he will consider it will be based on that more than anything else. We're not the most forgiving types when we are crossed out on a whim. \n\nEdit: a word
1	Thanks everyone, I really appreciate all of your responses. Today my ex and I talked for a while. He said he needs more time and space, that he wants to be friends in the future and if we're meant to be, we'll be together again, but only if it's destined. I don't believe in destiny so to me that last statement means nothing at all. As much as I love him and want him in my life, I know that our relationship had bad timing and was always challenging. I recently divorced someone who cheated on me and in my opinion has Narcissistic personality disorder (he's an ENTJ). This explains my feeling overwhelmed and insecure when I see even the smallest resemblance of situations in the new (now former) relationship to hurtful events that happened in my marriage. I'm also starting a new life and trying to figure out myself and my place in the world. My ISFJ ex-boyfriend is also trying to get somewhere with his career as a musician. I thought that we could be a good match since both needed our own time to work on our own paths, but I probably brought unresolved issues from my marriage to the new relationship, and he always felt inadequate in his role as a boyfriend because he didn't think he was in the right place in life to give me what he believes I need. Our communication styles were very different at times, I always wanted to analyze our problems in order to solve them, but too many times he couldn't vocalize his feelings or make sense of them. So even though I really miss him as a lover, I believe we should start as friends once he's ready and see what happens. Either way I grew very attached to him, he's such a wonderful man with the kindest soul, I would hate to not have him in my life. I believe our friendship will rekindle, hopefully soon. I'll keep y'all updated! Thanks again. I'll head to the INTP forum now to try to figure out my convoluted mind.
1	[I JUST GOT MY WIFE BACK IN 48HOURS]\nMy ex wife held it against me that I didn’t want to be married anymore and therefore she tried to get the kids to turn against me as well. I had a terrible relationship with all of them and most of it is because she either will not let me see them or she is filling their ears with a bunch of lies about me. We tried mediation, nothing seems to get through to her. I met Dr Akim who helped me cast a love spell, now there so much love and happiness in my family.

3	M25 Dating an ISFJ female (23), how to tell if she’s into me	Hi everyone. \n\nI’ve been speaking to an ISFJ women (23) for almost 4 weeks. We met on Bumble and have met up twice. We kissed on the first date (and also the second) and became more intimate on the second date (lots of cuddling, holding hands but not much more as we were in public). \n\nWe message a few times a day and generally just talk about our days. However, when we meet up, we talk about many different topics and have a great time (at least it appears that way). \n\nWe have a lot in common and hold a lot of the same beliefs/values. \n\nEven though I’ve only seen her twice I feel like I’m really starting to fall for her, and I’m trying to work out if she’s the same. \n\nThe main doubts in my mind are: sometimes when I’m talking, she’s easily distracted by someone else coming into the shop/bar/place where we are and occasionally will look around the room. I’m not sure if this is disinterest in me as she can recall pretty much anything I tell her in detail, so she appears to be listening. \n\nAlso, when we are messaging (and this is going to sound really silly but it confuses me) we end our message with kisses “x”. This gets automatically capitalised after any form of punctuation like so “X”, however, she changes it to the lower case “x” sometimes. Again, this sounds silly, but when you think about it, she’s actually making an effort to change the size of the kiss (which I’ve never thought about until she did it). She doesn’t convert it to lower case all the time which is what confuses me too. This is an arguably insignificant point but I’m not sure why she does it. Perhaps it indicates a deeper emotional response. \n\nShe’s told me that she’s never had a boyfriend before but is looking to date and strikes me as the sort of person who wants a meaningful and committed relationship (from what she’s talked about so far). \n\nShe does seem pretty shy and when I compliment her she blushes and will either say thanks or is like “I don’t know how to react” which is fair enough. She’s complimented me too, but usually after I compliment her. \n\nI know this is incredibly hard to tell from just a text post, but I’m wondering if this is more an ISFJ thing about concealing feelings, not wanting to come across too strong or if she genuinely doesn’t know herself. \n\nThanks for any help/advice on the matter :)\n\nTL;DR: speaking to and dating an ISFJ for almost a month, been on two dates, kissed her on both dates, I’ve made it clear I like her and I think she likes me, can sometimes appear as if she’s not listening to my end of the conversation, deliberately changes the kisses in a message, possibly to make them seem less significant (just guessing), seems to be pretty reserved in terms of revealing feelings and won’t compliment me much unless I compliment her first.  
9	The thing with the messages, I can tell that you're just thinking way too much. If I were to compare her with myself, the looking around is probably just nerves. Sometimes I feel awkward when there's silence and I'm just looking at someone, so I act like I'm not concerned with the silence and just look around to give myself some time to "recover" my nerves.\n\nBut every single person is different. You've been on two dates. Give it some time. 
8	Thoughts On INFPs?	Personally, as an INFP I feel like I annoy anyone and everyone around me. In your experience has this been true? What do you like and dislike about INFPs? Is there anything you admire or envy? Is there anything you're incredibly glad you don't have/experience internally? Because in my small experience with ISFJ people, you're all wonderful and I kind of want to latch onto you and never leave you alone, but I also feel like that might totally suck the life out of you. 
5	I'm an ISFJ who married an INFP. We seem to help balance each other out in terms of our attitudes towards life. I'm very focused and determined to accomplish my goals, sometimes too much, and can be a realist to a fault. She admits that she often gets caught up thinking and fantasizing about her goals and ambitions but never goes beyond that. She helps me to stop and smell the roses once in a while and I help her turn her daydreaming into action and results. We seem to bring each other closer to the middle on the work-play scale of life.\n\nI do have an artistic side that she brings out of me once in a while and I appreciate that. She also helps me realize that a little bit of clutter in your life isn't the end of the world.
5	No way! My dear friend and girl I have affection for is an INFP. It always feels like she’s trying to overflow and hold back at the same time. I say, if you know the person well, go for it! Show them your world. Granted, try to do it gradually. It can be exhausting, but don’t think that we don’t care. We really do care, even if it may not always seem like it. At least I do care about her thoughts. She’s always telling me these wild ideas she has and then she looks over at me and gets embarrassed for them. I assure you, there’s nothing to be embarrassed about. \n\nI also think we can help one another. You with your heads in the clouds and us with our heads towards the ground. Together, we can help teach each other to look forward. She always says that I’m smart and “wise” compared to her, but it’s just because she thinks her ideas are silly. I think she may be going a little far by calling my more rational views as “wise.” In the end, we can really get along well. Just don’t be afraid to open up, but do so at a good pace. 
2	Two of my best friends are INFPs, and I get along with them quite nicely! I have to say, I am a little envious of your artistic abilities. Most of the time I'm not very creative, and I wish I could find the inspiration to come up with cool works of art or creative writing like you guys do!

4	a INTPs question about you ISFJs	alright so this might be hard for you or maybe not you guys are rather foreign to me and i dont know if this is hard for you guys anyway i would like you to name every single thing you hate or dislike or just dont find very neat about a INTP. why? curiosity. and dont worry about hurting my feelings or anything i can take anything you could say. EDIT-just realized i said about you and i should have said for you but i cant edit it so just pretend it says for you if you would. should also mention unless you ask a question or say something along the lines of respond to this im not going to respond since this is not defending intps this is just gathering some info
6	My husband is INTP\n\nThe utilitarian drive to leave things out because it’s handy and then being oblivious to the mess. I don’t suffer from anxiety, but clutter really puts me on edge. \n\nAlso, if we’re both upset, trying to debate out the problem right away. I need time to calm down and think about why I’m upset or think of how to best vocalize it. He will press and press until I say anything and then he’ll try and argue a solution when I’ve only worked out a fifth of my feelings. It makes me feel like my feelings or the problem is being trivialized. \n\nI know he does this with the best intention of making things right between us ASAP, but it comes off as aggressive when I’m feeling tender. He’s learned to just leave me alone for an hour and then try again with a more conversational approach. \n
3	Um, everything? Except your intelligence. I, for one, admire that.
3	One of my best friends is an INTP. She's absolutely fascinating and I adore the way her mind works. If I were to name any flaws ... I guess she's kinda stubborn. Other than that, I guess she could pay a little bit more attention to me. I love being there for others but sometimes I also need someone to be there for me.
2	Help with Type	Hey guys. :) I'm trying to figure out my type and I'm stuck between ISFJ and a few other types. I have a few questions that I'm hoping to get ISFJ perspective on. Thanks for any help you can give!\n\nIs it true that ISFJs are comfortable dealing with lots of little detailed things? For example, working on taxes... does keeping track of all those detailed things you might need in order to complete that not bother you? Or another example, if you were working on a painting and there was a need to focus on doing small detailed lines, this sort of thing wouldn't bother you? Sorry for the weird examples, lol.\n\nDo you guys tend to take things people say at face value, or do you often 'read between the lines' and think they really mean something else?\n\nWould you say ISFJs are generally fairly present focused, like 'in the moment' people? I've heard some ISFJs say they are a mixture of in the moment and past oriented, but I've heard other ISFJs/ISTJs talk as if they are more purely focused on the present. Which do you think is more accurate for the typical ISFJ? Is it rare/uncommon for ISFJs to spend a good deal of time thinking about and/or planning for the future?\n\nIs it common for ISFJs to naturally consider many different perspectives/angles when trying to understand a person/idea/topic? Like naturally seeing multiple perspectives to different situations? I've seen this more often attributed to Ni-doms but I wanted to know if ISFJs are this way as well.
3	1. I like dealing with little detailed things.\n2. I always over analyze. Not really in between the lines but more what the person is hiding kind of thing.\n3. I don't think about the past that much, what done is done. Moving forward and think about the future most of the time.\n4. Mmmm I would say it depends, but it's not something I would put my finger on.
3	Hello! :) This is speaking from my personal experience, because I don't really know any fellow ISFJs irl.\n\n1. I'm super into details to the point that it becomes almost obsessive sometimes haha (exactly like your example about working on a painting!) I have a tendency to work on things down to the littlest detail, but I do enjoy it.\n\n2. I overthink a lot about things like the (possible?) meanings behind how people react in certain situations but in the context of speech I usually would take things at face value.\n\n3. I'm not really sure about what is common for ISFJs, but I do spend a lot of time thinking about the past. I think planning for the future is a pretty J thing to do in general though!\n\n4. I always like hearing different opinions on a matter! Seeing the different perspectives to a situation would usually come after reflecting on it and thinking about the different ways it could've gone.\n\nGood luck in figuring out your type!
3	Late response, but!\n\n1- Depends on the thing. Taxes, nope. I'm just now starting to get truly organized at nearly 23, and I do have my tax paperwork in order, but I have no earthly clue about the details that go into filing my taxes beyond finding the numbers to put into turbotax :P The painting though? Definitely. I have huge perfectionist tendencies and often slow myself allllll the way down trying to get tiny details in a project just right. You know those adult coloring books? I couldn't do them because the idea of picking the "wrong" color for a section stressed me out. \n\n2- Usually, right up until they give me reason not to. I forget a lot of things, but unless it's someone I have a ton of trust in anyway, I almost always remember to be suspicious of someone who's mislead me before, intentional or not. Until then, though, I absolutely take things at face value and probably seem quite gullible at times.  \n\n3- I dunno about others, but I would say I'm more of a mix. I tend to be fairly present-oriented and can find it hard to look at the bigger picture without deliberately putting myself in that frame of mind, but it's also easy for me to get consumed by thoughts of the past and dig myself into a rut (or sometimes even out of one, if I'm in a positive and productive frame of mind). I also do a fair amount of planning for and thinking about the future, but usually in a more abstract way, almost as if my "future self" and my "current self" are two totally separate, disconnected beings. \n\n4- Absolutey!! One of my favorite things is coming at things from different angles and making connections between different subjects. In school I always loved interdisciplinary stuff because it was so fascinating seeing how science impacted politics impacted art impacted philosophy, etc etc. Taking different opinions into account also tends to come fairly naturally to me? Even if I don't recognize on my own that someone could feel a particular way about something, I think it's valuable and interesting to hear why and gain a broader understanding of people's different views and motivations. I would tend to associate Fe or maybe even Ne with that trait over Ni, honestly.

1	Help	So I'm an enfp and I have an isfj friend... I ghosted her cause I was going through depression and wasn't really ready to talk to anyone. Recently got out and we connected again...\n\nStill funny thing is she can NEVER let go the fact that I left her...\n\nDespite me telling her I was going through a lot (from exams to work trouble)\n\nShe constantly tell me how during the ghosting period she had her own depression and blamed me cause I wasn't there...\n\nEach time we meet it's good but every time I touch a sensitive topic she brings that up and puts the spotlight back on me..\n\nIt's like I'm on thin ice...\n\nSo can you guys give me tips on how to handle this or was it even my fault to begin with? \n\n

11	Wallflower status?	Recently, I was called a dichotomy between being a wallflower and the nature of my "true" personality. I was told I present myself as a wallflower and am easily overlooked until I allow others to experience and know the person I am underneath. And, if I would allow others in, I would lessen the isolation I potentially lock myself in.\n\nI am conflicted by this. Have you any similar experiences? 
2	This is a huge source of inner conflict for me. I think the wallflower status comes with being an introvert in some ways. Isolation has been an ongoing theme in my life and I've been told there is a wall I keep around myself. This was unbeknownst to me as I have felt that there isn't much to tell or that I'm straightforward and open. People clearly don't see it that way though. I feel like this issue lessens my ability to form connections and to progress in the way that I want to in life as people don't feel like they really "know" me well enough and this translates to a lack of trust on their part and a hesitation. 
3	What is your enneagram type?	I don't feel like this has been a main topic of discussion for a while, so please elaborate! I just took the test myself and I'm a 4w5, which apparently isn't very common among ISFJs, and I was wondering about the rest of you!
6	Turns out I'm a 6w5
3	What is an enneagram?
1	I’m 2w1 (type 2 is the helper) \nMy next likeliest is 6
1	My ISFJ friend is a 6w5
4	Thoughts on INTPs?	What's the general consensus?\n\nWhat's your experience with them as friends, relatives, or lover?\n\nI hate them. I admire their intelligence, but they're very difficult for me to accommodate; leaves me literally crying in frustration and disappointment. 
6	As an INTP: 99.9% useless, 0.1% absolutely genious. Out of a 1000 INTPs, one will discover a new source for electricity or some shit, the rest staying as worthless sarcastic meme-lords...
2	you guys are just way too emotional for us but hey now for my hourly sarcastic comment. you guys just love us so much dont you? now then the fact that we are difficult for you making you cry is a example of this
1	love their wittiness, logic ability and intelligence. dislike their lack of affection, communication and genuine interest in other people's lives. 
6	I'm ISFJ when I'm weak and ISTJ when I'm strong	I have periods of sadness and emotion processing (some shit happened) and during those I'm 90% certain I'm ISFJ.\n\nOtherwise when I'm not hurt or falling into emotional attachment towards a person, I'm ISTJ.\n\nSo... I can't decide. Really, what am I?
6	do you use Fe or Te? you can't be two types. depression is also not a type;) thinkers get sad too. 
1	This exact same thing happens to me, too! I chalk it up to my mood changing, and when taking the test, doing something different in the situations asked during the test. \n\n90% of the time I'm ISFJ, other times ISTJ. Either personality fits me, strangely. Nothing says you can't have traits from both types!\n\n
1	ISTJs and ISFJs can both be strong, just in their own ways.
12	DAE want to learn many things, but don't have the energy for it?	I want to be a polymath, but I don't have the energy for learning.
2	More than energy, I think I lack the time to learn things because of a super busy school schedule haha. But yeah, feeling burnt out gets in the way sometimes as well.
1	Something that has worked for me is listening to audiobooks while driving.  If you drive a lot, I recommend this.
8	What kinds of things make you laugh/do you find funny?	
20	I found this [post](https://imgur.com/a/BG249) somewhere on Pinterest about isfjs’ sense of humor. I think it’s pretty spot on, for me at least.
4	Puns.
3	Memes (even dark ones), when people fail repetitively, and weird people. Or certain words that remind someone of something funny which I randomly blurt out.
3	Puns and sarcasm. My sense of humor can be very dry and twisted.
11	DAE feel like they want something in their life, but don't know what it is?	
3	I know I want things in my life, but I don’t how exactly I would go about doing that. Anything dependent on having someone else isn’t quite there.\n\nLike I want to start a family but I can’t even find someone that’s interested in me romantically and etc.\n\nI know I want to leave a legacy, but I don’t know exactly how I want to go about doing that. \n\nThere aren’t definitive things you want out of life?
3	ENTP needs gift ideas	Second time dating, this time for real. I've known here for 7 years, friends the whole time. Dated her once but wasn't ready to settle down.\n\nAnyway, nothing is off limits.\n\nShe's a teacher, hates bananas, and is a sexyaf ginger.\n\nI was thinking about getting her something banana related. Like a piece of art, or a banana that also has another function, like a vibrator, or paperweight, or something. Maybe an artsy golden vibrator she can also use to weigh down papers?\n\nShe does want a 23andme kit, so maybe that.\n\nI dunno. Any thoughts?\n\nShe doesn't like a whole lot of attention. Maybe a little get away?
4	What's the occasion?\nI know for me, I tend to prefer more traditional gifts, and while joke gifts can be funny, I don't appreciate them as much if it's for a special occasion. \n\n\nIt doesn't have to be expensive, but sentimental stuff means a lot. My boyfriend got me a silver bracelet for our first Christmas together, with a panda charm on it. We have an inside joke about pandas, and he went to a ton of different stores trying to find something with a panda on it. When I opened it, I nearly cried, just because of the sentimental value of it, and how hard he tried to find something that would be meaningful to me. \n\n\nI don't know about all ISFJs, but I tend to dislike gifts that are just going to be clutter on a shelf, that I feel obligated to hold onto for a while because it was a gift. I much prefer something practical, that I can actually use or wear.\n\n\nThis is going to vary a lot depending on her own interests and hobbies, but I would suggest trying to find something that is personal and sentimental to her, and I wouldn't recommend getting her a joke gift if it's for something important, like a birthday or anniversary, unless it's a side to her real gift. 
4	How do you process emotions? How do you know your true desires and the reason why?	
2	I think about them a lot. I tend to reflect on things that happened in the past and wonder why they happened and why I reacted the way I did, but a lot of the time it ends up with me overthinking. I feel like while overthinking can kind of warp your perception of reasons why, it also helps to unearth your true desires because of how much you think about it again and again. (But also causes way too much stress sometimes because of how messed up things can become in your head haha)\n\nI think talking to a fellow F helps to put emotions into perspective though, and makes it easier to process and come to terms with them.\n\nWriting down your thoughts when you're feeling emotional helps too, since you can run everything through your head and process it before putting the thoughts into words.
2	I’m in my own head a lot, so I find going to counseling and having the therapist reflect my emotions back to me very helpful. It provides clarity that I might not otherwise have. 
1	i read on and practice mindful living and watch a lot of youtube videos, particularly from the channel "school of life". and i reflect on myself using the collective philosophies i've learned to figure stuff out. and i also read a bunch of buddhist philosophy stuff and apply those too.\n\nthis video is a good watch for a western process of self reflection:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlckdvjK0Io
1	Is it common for ISFJs to have workaholic tendencies?	And do you guys have ways to increase your productivity/motivation while working?
6	I know I'm definitely a workaholic. If I work too long and hard on something, though, I'll burn out extremely easily and start to feel overwhelmed and unreal and a load of stuff. \n\nMy main motivations are just wanting to get things done and over with. Sometimes it's difficult to push myself but it ends up happening. 
2	yes, i'm a workaholic. and i think ISFJs tend to work hard and devote themselves to whatever it is they feel they need to do.\n\npersonally, i don't really have a way to increase motivation or productivity. i think i just rely heavily on diligence. i've never felt really driven in my work.
2	I have a high sense of responsability and my workaholic habits derive mostly from that. Fortunately, I am motivated at work, but the extra effort I put (affecting my well being sometimes) is because I don't want to deceive anyone nor me. 
1	I can be and my mom most certainly does\n\n
1	yes! and I just try to make sure I don't bring work home with me too much, which is hard working at a school. I think just finding a way to get into your 'zone' while working helps to get things done way faster and oftentimes better. for me, I like to actually sit in the midst of chaos (usually an absent student's desk, or a nearby table) because that way I am still involved with what is currently going on and can help, but I don't have to stop what I am doing or remove myself from the situation when kids need me. 
1	I deliberately stop studying and return to my normal life until I can no longer endure the emptiness, loneliness, and vapidness, then I want to study again.
4	INFJ and ISFJ relationships	Hello all you ISFJs! \nI'm an INFJ female who is dating a wonderful ISFJ man. What do y'all think of being in a relationship with INFJs? Is it generally a good match for y'all? Why or why not? What are the strengths (and weaknesses) of this pairing from y'alls perspective?\n\nThanks :)
7	I saw on one website where the isfj feels fulfilled but the infj not so much. It was one of those charts that shows how all types tend to match up with each other.   I can dig up the chart later, but I’m standing on a train typing with one hand right now on my phone. I have it on my laptop.   Update: Search "simplified myers briggs type compatibility chart" and you will see a chart with lots of green, red, yellow, light-green, and some blue squares.  There are a lot of other cool charts there too.  You can do a lot of reading and learn pretty quickly.  I agree with +Huuuligan below, that any type can work as long as both are healthy and willing to make it work.  I, INFJ (M), have been married to an ISFJ (F) for 26 years and my experience is on par with what I have read about this pairing.  Personally, I have female friends who are ENFP, INFP, INFJ, and ESFJ, and I must say,  like the "NF"'s best.  I have also related well with one female INTJ that I know, but she was a bit of a narcissists.  In general, I get along with most people, but prefer "NF" types.  I am still waiting to know an ENTP in real life.
3	[deleted]
4	I know you posted this a few days ago but I am an ISFJ married to an INFJ. We have been together about 10 years now :)\n\nWe found what worked best for us was learning how the other person thinks and how they communicate. We actually looked up articles on INFJ's & ISFJ's in hopes to gain further insight to benefit our relationship. It ended up being a positive experience by changing how we approached one another in our day to day lives.\n\nBut something that I am so grateful for in my INFJ husband, is that he always awes me in how much he really thinks about things. I am more emotional and tend to get stuck in my own mindset that I rarely think in terms of multiple view points. And so when we go to discuss something, he is able introduce me to ideas and thoughts that I never even entertained before. I have found myself to be a much more accepting of others and their views and I thank him for that :)\n\nMy husband and I are also very introverted, which I view as a food thing. We can be home, sitting in the same room, not speaking, but still enjoying each other's company. He is also similar to me in that he is very loyal in his relationships. Not only romantically, but to his friends ans family as well. He is always there when needed and extremely devoted.\n\nAll in l I truly think ISFJs and INFJs can have great relationships together. I just think the key is understanding how ypu both think and communicate because in my opinion that is the major difference between ISFJs and INFJs. But that major difference, as I pointed out, can turn into a positive as it will allow you insight into how another person views the world. \n\nBest of luck to you. I wish you both nothing but happiness :)
4	Forgetting certain stuff?	DAE forget certain details about people we love? Like, logically we know it's something we're not supposed to forget, yet we forgot it. Could be their favorite food or certain dislikes.\n\nAlso, when I'm mad at someone and I don't get the chance to engage/confront the person or something, as weeks/months pass I eventually forget why I was ever mad at the person. Yet I still want to hate the person even if I don't logically know why.\n\nIs this an ISFJ thing?
3	I forget a boat load of things unless I found it particularly interesting lol. There's also the "were *you* the one who was telling me they almost got killed by an alligator? no? someone else then." 
1	I don't relate with the first part of your question really, few times I forget about details of people I love. But I can relate more with the second part. Sometimes I get angry and I know in that instsnt what makes me angry, but as times pass by, I forget about the specifics and only the bad feelings remain. 
1	I'm not sure if it is an ISFJ thing, but I can definitely relate to both, and I'm an ISFJ.
1	Regarding the first part, I do this a whole lot with people. I had to end a friendship because I was horrible about forgetting triggering subjects for her and some of those topics were things I discussed daily with other friends. But, usually after 2-3 times, I remember it, same as with learning new things (except things like playing along to music, usually takes 5+ tries to remember it)
3	ISFJ's: What is your vice? If you have one...	And oppositely, what is an outlet you have? 
3	I sometimes don't pay public transportation. Easy to do in my country. \n\nI also have a consensual nonconsent fetish. It's actually a thing. No, I/we do not condone rape. Outlet? Staged "forced fucking" porn, Hentai, imagination, etc.\n
2	I smoke weed everyday
1	if it's the middle of the night i turn on red at no turn on red intersections and i treat certain red lights as stop signs. it's 3am, no one is driving on these tiny roads near me.\n\ni hang out at public parks after they're closed. some nights a good swing is just what i need. also there are deer in these parks and i like looking at them from a safe distance.\n\ni guess this vice is my thinking law can be dumb and is ok to ignore. my outlets are doing those things.\n\ni think some people suck. and i want to help them less even though i understand they need it more. but they really suck and i don't have infinite patience. i think this vice is... judgementalness? but it ties into self care, so...iono, it's iffy.\n\noh! so i'm super responsible when it comes to other people, my interactions with them, and my personal emotional well being. but i don't clean my room. it's the one place i allow myself to be lazy. i only do enough laundry for the week and i dump em on my bed. and the dirty clothes are all over the floor. because laundry is stupid.\n\nalso i don't fold my sheets. i just have a blanket nest i fall into when i come home.
1	Alcohol all the way. I let things get to me and drink to forget.
1	- my worst vice is biting my nails, I can't stop, tried several times. It has also progressed to biting my lips. \n\n- I smoke weed almost daily, only at night when I come home from work. I feel bad for not doing more productive stuff but I tell myself I also have the right to chill a bit. \n\n- Sometimes I feel lazy and don't feel like participating in a group convo then I loose myself in my thoughts instead of being there actively involved.\n\n\n\n\n
1	Eating too much and being lazy/unproductive with my life

5	How long did it take you to get over the end of a friendship?	It's starting to bother me. It's only been a week and three days (and counting) though, so I guess it's still normal. But, every single day I reminisce more than thrice. Shit. Hurts. :/ How long until this fades away? If only my friend would welcome me back, that'd be great. But, that ain't happening.
6	I still miss friends I lost 5-10 years ago 
1	I'm sorry, losing a friend sucks. I think it's like a breakup. It's devastating the first week or two, but slowly dissipates over time. 
1	i try not to think of stuff like this as an on and off switch. it's a slow fade. and trying to count down until it's done only makes it slower. \n\nthere is more to your life than this person. keep focusing on those things that also matter but you can actually do something about aside from waiting. eventually you'll be fine when it fades beyond a certain point.
1	What MBTI is this friend? I'm curious. I had a falling out with two "friends" and a ex boyfriend, and in the case of all three, they were unhealthy in the fact that I was used. I was able to detach myself fairly quickly from these, because I logically recognized it needed to go for my own good, and that that friendships were nothing to them.\n\nThere is one INTP friend I had like a year ago... that friendship falling out was really weird. We were close, almost dated (but I wasn't ready for another relationship) so we just remained friends. We  had an instant connection, so much in common, and an emotional bond; we talked to each other so much. To this day, he is the only person who I've been able to open up to in such a short time. The only issue was, we were so comfortable around each other that what we said was unfiltered; we both are extremely sarcastic and playful, but sometimes we made jokes to each other and the other wouldn't see it as a joke, and we would end up hurting the other's feelings. I'm not sure if this is the exact reason we started to talk less (I think he felt awkward hanging around my friends and I, and needed to find some guy friends to talk to lol), anyway, that's what happened. It was weird, because although it seemed like we were avoiding each other, he would still look after me. Now we have talked since then, but it isn't like what it used to be; we are way more distant and professional, in a way you would talk to someone you didn't know very well. I'm hesitant to bring up what happened between us, so I haven't. \n\nPoint is, you have to let go. I don't know if this is an ISFJ thing or a me thing, but I tend to get really hurt when it's someone who I've really let my guard down around (such as my INTP friend.) Sometimes, you won't know why a friendship has ended; however you need to move on. Good luck! 
4	I realize that I absolutely need time alone, even from my dear girlfriend.	So I used to live alone, for almost 7 years.\n\nI've moved in with my now fiancée, it's been a year and a half.\n\nWhile she's also kind of introverted I don't think she's an isfj, probably more of a infp, I'll have her take the test some day but this is not what this post is about.\n\nShe needs her moments too and this makes the relation work great, we have our time apart when needed (like, I'm in the room on my computer, she's in the living room with a book or her laptop, we do our own things).\n\nBut last Friday I took a day off (because I was exhausted and it's rather calm at work), didn't do much, even took a nap in the afternoon and played video games a bit.\n\nHer not being at home was a definite plus. It's different if she's in the other room or out of the house completely.\n\nNow I love her and she really is my soulmate, we've been together for almost three years now and everything works and clicks perfectly.\n\nBut my mind/body really needs the time alone from time to time.\n\nDoes anyone encounter the same feelings? Anyone has tricks/tips regarding this?
9	I don’t need to be totally alone, I just need to be left alone sometimes. My husband doing his own thing in the house or the same room is just fine. He’s an INTP and feels the same way. \n\nOne of the greatest compliments that he’s given me is “being with you is like being by myself.” It kind of sounds rude but from an introvert It’s totally flattering. 
7	relationships require us to split up our lives in 3 parts: you, me, and we.\n\nit's really important to have them. just make sure that all parties know what those are as they shift and change with time. it seems that she and you currently have different understandings on where they are at and where they should be. just make sure to talk a lot less clinically or technically than i am at the moment when trying to come to an understanding about them with her. this should be a warm conversation, full of love, understanding, and acceptance if you can swing it. and make sure to keep each other up to date on them.
5	I absolutely need my time alone, and I’m not sure that’s exclusive to a personality type.  Time alone is time you are most free to grow.\n\nBe ‘selfish’ and take time for yourself guilt-free.  Tell her you need time to yourself.  She will appreciate it, I’m sure.
3	Try dedicating some alone time for yourself and keep an open mind since it may not always be in the comfort of your own living space. To me, my alone time away from my boyfriend is going to the gym. Even just going for a walk alone to think and clear your head I think can be very beneficial. Co-habitating is hard and maybe having just a simple discussion with your partner about your need to have alone time is a conversation that needs to be had. Obviously you love your partner and the time you both spend together, but when alone time is reenergizing and is important to make sure you have the time you need. 
2	It's wholly understandable, and sometimes more beneficiary than it seems. I got a lot more done at work last night because I worked away from the others, and I never thought that'd happen. (Also the """"boss"""" for the area sorta hates me, working away from her was nice.)
1	I don't know. I've never been in a relationship. But, if I was, I probably would never want to be alone or apart from her. Think dog with abandonment issues.
7	Been a week since my bestfriend ended our friendship - I still haven't moved on	Tl;dr: she said it'd be better for the both of us if in the long run if we end the friendship; that it's not about incompatibility, it's about being separate individuals. I'm a sensitive, needy and attached ISFJ and she's this cold independent INTP. Some time ago, she said I'm still free to message if I really need her because I'll always be a friend to her (and she knows I have very, very, very few friends), but at the same time also told my other best friend to dissuade me from reconnecting and patching things up with her (...the hell though?)\n\nI still feel so fucking frustrated and sad about it. I liked her a lot, I really did. And she's the second person I ever truly let inside my core. I thought I'd moved on, but... shit. Sometimes when I think about her, all I could feel is anger and frustration. But, there's always that "I still want you back, I still want things to go back the way it used to be" feeling in me. I'm still hoping for it. Shit hurts.
4	It takes time. It honestly takes a lot of time. Time doesn't always heal but it makes things a bit easier to deal with. \nI know how it feels cause I went through something similar with a long time friend ages ago. The situation was a little different but, i know the feeling. I cried a lot. Many many many months. The remembering and processing sucks, I think especially cause we're ISFJ's and when we get attached and let someone in, it hurts like a mofo letting go. Be it for the best or the worst. \nWhat I suggest is to give it time and go through the motions. Especially focus on yourself. Do things that make you happy and hobbies that your passionate and and you want to pick up. Go out for little walks with music or something to clear your mind. \nFocus on you right now. There are so many people out there that you can make amazing friendships with. Healthy and wonderful friendships. Who want to be in your life and care about you. Only until the past year I've met friends that feel like that and damn does it make a difference. \nBut I tell you, it hurts now and it may even later. But soon it will only be a memory. Just a memory to be left in the past. 
3	I’m in the same situation, my friend ended it all two weeks ago. I’m doing well at the moment but it’s still in my mind daily. I get so attached to people and it’s so goddamn hard to let go of anyone, even if they weren’t worth my time... 
3	What to get a 10 year old isfj for his birthday tomorrow?	He loves minecraft, games and Barcelona fc. But I want to get him something he doesn't even know he wants. Any suggestions? :) 
4	I don't think anyone will suggest an universal ISFJ gift... Each person has specific interests and hobbies. But as you say in your comment, gifting an experience may be a good idea, it should remain as a good memory and it would be unexpected for him. If he is adventurous, maybe some kind of activity like and adventure park (those places with bridges and ziplines in the trees), I would have loved that! 
1	There is a lot of affordable Minecraft mech available. \n\nBut I think just learning how to play and build something for him in the game would be a better gift. A gift with thought.
2	Do you find it hard to not do something you feel strongly?	
3	Personally, if I feel strongly about something I find it incredibly difficult to ignore it/not do something about it. Its conflicting for me. If I dislike someone, I ignore them. If I like someone, I will do everything within my power for them. I want to feel that ive done everything I can for those I care for. I would never purposefully harm someone, through actions or words. \n\n I try and understand the way I have made people feel and what I have done to deserve the way they treat me, from that I try to understand my own feelings and find a solution to the problem. That might be more helpful than telling them off? Idk. 
1	Could you give some example? 
2	Is this an ISFJ-way of warming to people?	Recently, I (F/ENFJ) was talking to a male ISFJ in the same college's club. We've known each other since start of last year. After talking about our classmates, he told me that he's actually "really bad at talking with girls".\n\nI was quite shocked since I always thought we were on different wavelengths and that he didn't like me. I thought this was kind of odd since I wouldn't tell that to a guy? Or is this just an ISFJ-way of warming up to people? 
3	I don't think it's ISFJ specific. If you did not have strong friendships or just relationships with a certain gender (could be even your own), you're gonna be clunky.\n\nI think you should take that as a sign of proposed friendship, at least on his part.\n\nI did not have the best relationship with my mom, no sisters and so it took me a while to be comfortable with girls. And at the same time, now a good friend of mine who is a girl tells me she can't make any friends with other girls.
1	How do an ISFJ react when he love somebody ?	And how do he react when sombody tell him "I love you"
3	Yes.
1	Idk about others, but I tend to invest a tad bit too much emotion. Okay, who am I kidding. I invest A LOT of emotion and attachment it's not even funny. Then, I get friendzoned and shit hurts like Hell.\n\nNo one's ever told me they love me in a romantic way. My ex-best friend did, but only as a friend, but we're not friends anymore, so what the hell. But, to answer your question... I'd probably freeze, blink a couple times, and basically go blue screen of death tryna figure if the person truly meant it and what the fuck would happen henceforth.
4	Opinions of INTJs?	I ask because you're the type that I am most unfamiliar with. Do you have any INTJ family/friends/coworkers? What's your verdict on/experience with us?
7	egotistical about their sense of individuality to a fault.
4	My fiancée is an intj. AMA. 
3	I'm an ISFJ that's been married to an INTJ for 18 years.  We have two boys aged 17 and 14.  We've been intensely focused on the lives of our boys for 17 years now and not so much on our own relationship.  The thought of being empty nesters is daunting -- we've been discussing our incompatibilities recently, not sure right now if we're going to stay together or split up.  Very difficult times for us right now.  Ask any questions you like...
3	Things that really annoy me!! (ISFJ-specific or nah?)	Del
4	I can completely relate to everything you said. Another one to add is anyone who talks about someone who isn't around. Usually if it's something negative about a person, they might have done something that would be embarassing. I don't see other people's shortcomings as heaps necessary topics of conversation, and if they're criticised in some way, I'd rather just talk to the actual person about it instead of going behind their back. 
1	I'm trying to think about how to cross those all at the same time, just for illustration.\n\nJust you know why you hold so dearly any of those, anyway ?
4	Has anyone here used a dating app?	If so, which has worked best for you?
3	I used Tinder, and it worked great for me.\n\n\n\nI downloaded it for the entertainment value, out of morbid curiosity. I had no intention of actually meeting up with anybody on there, and I assumed most (if not all) of the people using it were just seeking hookups, which isn't appealing to me.\n\n\n\nWithin a few hours of having the app, though, I matched with a really awesome guy. He was funny, attractive, seemed really normal. We talked for a few days and went out, and we've been together for nearly a year and a half now. I'm very happy with him.\n\n\nI'm probably in the minority with my immediate success, though, and I have a lot of friends who've had zero luck with Tinder.
2	Grindr has worked fairly well for me. I find it’s the best one for gay guys because it’s simply got the largest population. It is however a hookup app, or at least has the reputation.\n\nThough as a caveat to hookup apps, if you’re looking for the long term relationships like I do, I find it important to humanize myself in their eyes as they’re human to me. I look for the potential of friendship in who I’m talking to, not necessarily someone who has 100% the same qualities or interests I have, but someone who I can enjoy being around.  That means they need to see me for that as well. \n\nI’ve found a few quality guys who I’ve fallen out of relationships with for reasons more to do with them or our inability to see eye to eye on critical issues, but that’s been due to issues developed after meeting and getting to know one another. \n\nI do recommend that if you get into a dating app, it’s better to talk to the person for a few days at least before meeting up, unless there’s really a good connection. (I’ve had that work out for one guy actually who I dated for around 2 months). \n\nGood luck! 
2	I've tried a few apps (POF, Tinder, etc), and didn't have much luck. I gave Bumble a try about a month ago and have been dating someone after less than a week on the app. \n\nI felt Bumble gave me the opportunity to vibe out my possibilities without being harassed or spammed the way I experienced with other apps.  
2	I've used Tinder and OkCupid. Tinder was pretty much a bust for me since I've been looking for more than just a hookup. OkCupid has been much more successful for me, especially with the more in-depth profile sections and whatnot. It's a lot easier to see what you might have in common with someone, assuming they fill stuff out to a certain extent. 
1	Use POF. Haven't had too much luck, but I've made a few friends. 
7	What are three words people use the most to describe you?	Out of curiosity...
12	Calm, mature, and salty. 
4	Quiet, loyal and overly kind
3	quiet and weird lol. can’t think of a third 
3	I would say quiet (what a surprise!) , nerd, kind. 
3	serious, quiet, nice
2	Forgiving, kind, and trusting.\n\n(Ready to move on from conflict, too nice to step on people's toes, and I want to see the good in everyone)
2	Sensitive, sweet, weird
2	wise, selfless, introverted
2	Weird, Kind, and Loyal
2	Turbulent, sensitive/needy/very attached, and withdrawn.
2	Hardworking, selfless, "mum"
3	ENTJ female dating ISFJ	Hi  ISFJ"s i"m a ENTJ female dating male ISFJ. This is definitely not a common paring and a entire new frontier for me I'd  to know more about my ISFJ and what makes him tick ?  Why / how is he so content ?  What makes him the most happy? My ISFJ is the kindest most emotionally supportive partner I've ever had and I'd like to know how to show him I appreciate him - what is the most effective way?\n\nBtw I am all for the ENTJ -ISFJ couple. It takes a lot of patience and a certain type of person  to be with a ENTJ and I think the ISFJ is the most understanding 😊\n\n
2	Just read the love languages book. It'll help you better, IMO, for showing him the right affection. Figure out what his love language is and do it.\n\nIf its helpful, my ISFJ is acts of service and quality time.
1	Just say thanks, it goes a long way for us. Most ISFJs want to feel included and by acknowledging what we did shows us that. Feel free to call out our BS too. I personally hate it when people don't tell me I'm doing something that annoys them.
-1	The 16personality site has plenty of info on the isfj have a look . 
2	what does the judging part of isfj mean?	hi all i was just wondering what this means & if it comes from a negative kind of place
8	My judging allows me to plan far ahead into the future, and to keep everything organized as I head toward my hopes and goals. When it comes to doing activities, I like to know exactly where I'm going, who I'm going with, what time I'm going, who's going to be there, etc. and know exactly what I'm doing, rather than just making it up on the fly. \n\nIt can be stifling if you get too caught up in it; planning so far ahead has also caused me a lot of stress and I have often been told that I need to loosen up. I think it's mostly useful if managed well. 
3	The last letter in the MBTI is either J (judging) or P (perceiving). All this means is which you prefer to present in your extroverted self. The words "judging" and "perceiving" are a bit confusing, but all they mean is, do you present as someone who prefers to *take in information* (perceiving) or someone who *loves to make decisions or act on information* (Judging)?\n\nFor example, my friend is an INT**P**. He loves to read and is very very knowledgeable, and if you talk to him at length about almost any topic, he will surprise you with how much he knows. He prefers to present himself (his extroverted side) as someone who gathers knowledge, who perceives.\n\nI am an INT**J** I don't much care to look like the one who has a lot of knowledge, who takes in information, even if I do that a lot. I usually show myself as desiring to be the one to figure things out, to *use* the knowledge I've already gained to make decisive judgments.\n\nThese two sides are represented in the middle two letters of the MBTI. So, as an ISFJ, you perfer to **perceive** by trusting your senses, focusing on all the details because you need to know every little thing before the big picture becomes clear. And you prefer to **judge** (make decisions) by relying on your feelings rather than thinking things through. And overall, you prefer to show yourself as someone who likes to make decisions (judging) over someone who collects information (perceiving).\n\nThe toughest thing is the the connotation of the word "Judging" makes it sound like you're a very judgmental person. That's not what it means at all.
9	How do you handle the end of a friendship?	I was very attached to an INTP friend, and our friendship has basically ended. It's been a few days and I'm still having trouble accepting it and moving on. With her gone, I'm now left with only one friend who's been with me before I met her and I'm positive will be here for a lifetime.\n\nJust curious, how do you handle this shit? :/
3	I’m the same, I get really attached to people and it’s so hard to let them go. One of my friends (well, now an ex-friend...) ended our friendship a bit over a week ago and she was probably the closest to me so it’s really hard. I don’t know what to do about this... I’m trying to focus on myself but it’s difficult. 
2	It's been almost a year since I've ended my friendship with my best friend of 20 years. I'm still not over it. I'm trying to manage and figure out how to handle it. What makes it hard for me because since I'm so introvert, I don't talk to my other friends as much as I talked to her and I feel she was the only one that understood me. \n\nI'm trying to talk it out with my therapist but haven't come to any resolutions. :-/
2	This question hits way too close to home as I’m doing this with a friend of 24 years.
2	I just went through this myself. My friend was also an INTP and we had been what I would consider fairly good friends until she became extremely toxic to the point where I had to cut her off for the sake of my own mental health. I basically idolized her skills and went from adoring her to having to withdraw entirely.\n\nIt's been a process of a few months for me to accept it and move on.  I wish it could be faster, and it's mostly along now, but it still stings that I can't talk to her like I used to. I went through periods of trying to talk to her again (like an idiot), going to mutual friends for advice, and generally being upset about the whole ordeal. I should've separated myself from her fully rather than try to bring it back, because she's only exploded at me time and time again. 
1	It's never easy. One of my coworkers (INFJ) became a really close friend of mine (even met her family and her kids, whom I have grown to love) but I was tasked to terminate her due to horrible work performance and conflict of interest issues.\n\nLeading up to it, I cried the day before I had to fire her. Was hard to even keep a straight face in the two-week duration I had to wait to fire her.\n\nShe hasn't responded to my calls or messages even though she's reached out to other coworkers to wish them luck and to take care. It's safe to say that my friendship with her has ended.\n\nIt sucked for a couple of days but if things ended, then usually there's a very good reason for it. There is a lesson in broken relationships so try to find it and roll with it the best you can. You'll be ok once your head is clear and you become logical in your approach, not emotional. So hang in there!
3	How do you lot study?	self explanatory title lol. currently studying for grad school entrance exams, and wanted to understand my learning style better via mbti. 
2	I try 4 hours a day (Mon-Fri) and in weekends around 6 hours. Currently on 1st year of Medical School in Poland
2	My study habits consist of lots of writing and drawing, I'm horrible at art tho so I  just do what I can, but I'm very visual in learning. I need to see it in my head and it will stick . Like when I had to learn how the heart pumps, I could not for the life of me listen or read and just get it I had to physically see the heart pumping blood in  my head and I got it . Also making little inside jokes on things helps me get it too when I was in anatomy learning muslces was a challange for me so I would come up with things that sounded similar and funny so I would remember , example : Tensor Fasciae Latae muscle I would always have it in my head like tense up for fish latte , still laugh every time , I'm just weird like that but hey if I understand it in the end it works :P 
2	If you're trying to absorb information, the best method is repeated testing! Recalling information over and over again strengthens those pathways in the brain, making future recall even easier. Source: INTJ in grad school for psych
2	I used a lot of flash cards. I also took notes exclusively in pen because the physical act of writing helps solidify the learning more than typing does.

0	I'm in between ISFJ and INTJ.	### Edit: I MEANT ISFJ AND I*S*TJ!!!\n\nOkay, I'm confused.\n\nI'm very particular who I choose as friends, who I let into my "inner world" or "core".\n\nTo the "others", that would be everyone else, I'm this logical, high and mighty, and withdrawn ISTJ. Although deep inside I care too much what they think, I still try not to let it affect me. Like, I lowkey try to be "above" everyone else, because I can be above them, also so they'd be too intimidated/uncomfortable to even think about putting me down or something. Oh and frankly, I fucking hate others and only respect them to avoid conflict.\n\nBut, to the people I'd die for, I'm this clingy, needy, impulsive, turbulent, and very protective ISFJ. I'm so protective it's hard when a friend requires me to "give me some time for myself" because being unable to know what they're up to is so hard for me. Like, I don't trust they'll be good on their own without me. Sometimes my desire to help them exceeds boundaries, it's hard for me to be content when friends don't tell me the reason why they want to be treated a certain way.\n\nSomeone help me decide.
2	Ok you should look into taking a cognitive function test like at \n\nhttp://similarminds.com/classic_jung.html\n\n\nISFJ Functional Stack: Si Fe Ti Ne\n\nISTJ Functional Stack: Si Te Fi Ne\n\nBasically the difference is ISFJs when making decisions are going to consider people and values before impersonal analysis and logic and with ISTJs it’s vice versa. So do you find that I Ti ally make decisions more based on people/values or on impersonal analysis/logic. 
1	What do you need help deciding?
1	Also, I think I read that post as "I'm unhappy one way. I'm also unhappy another way. Which one am I"? \n\nYou're both. And I hope you try to resolve your unhappiness. I thought maybe you'd want instead to focus your question around that.
1	have you taken a test focusing on cognitive functions? as someone below mentioned, we have all 8 functions. you aren't *just* a feeler or *just* a thinker- you have the ability to do both, just in different order. \n\ndo you more-so make decisions more so based on rationality/order order or compassion/empathy? e.g. if you were a judge, would you be *more so* by the book and follow the law no matter what, or would you be willing to give some leeway based on the individual's situation?
17	Is it common for ISFJs to be loners and be annoyed by most people?	Don't get me wrong, I am not a horrible person but I have never really been close with many people. I think a lot of people are incredibly shallow,superficial and will stab you in the back if given the chance. Maybe I mistyped myself even because a lot of ISFJs seem warm and nurturing and are more socially oriented. 
8	It's a very common introverted thing, especially if you're more awkward socially. \n\nIf you're an ISFJ it doesn't mean you like everyone - you might just be nice and polite to them just because that's what feels right, or you want to avoid unnecessary conflict. And there's also the possibility of a Si-Ti loop, where you use Fe less than it's normal and feel more disconnected from other people. I know I do.\n\nAnd ultimately yes, you could have mistyped yourself. But I would skip most of the type descriptions and read more on the function stack - see what functions you actually use.
7	holy shit, you just described me. i've never seen anyone on this sub mention this, but i sometimes feel like an outlier of the isfj's because deep down, i think most people are superficial and annoying. but i'm also described as really nice. i thought maybe i mistyped myself as well, but i feel like the functions line up with me. 
3	I can relate too, although this feeling was more prominent a couple of years back. I forced myself to become a bit more social, and I found that some people was good company and it was my mistake not to socialize, but I still find a lot of people that is not my cup of tea precisely. I am polite because I don't have reasons not to be nice and I don't want to cause any unnecesary problem. \n\nI don't know about you, but I am very bad at lying and if I don't like someone I try to limit my interactions with them because I am paranoid that my face will show my disapproval. 
2	You are right about being polite, it feels natural and I tend to avoid conflict at all costs! I am still learning about functions so I will look more into it. 
2	yup i'm very weary around people unless i think I would actually be able to have a great conversation with them
1	Yes, I experience this a lot. Granted, there are one or two people I would do anything to spend every day around, and that don't irritate me, but I will admit that sometimes I am shallow and superficial. I should work more on being around people and not burning bridges. 
1	I rather have a small group of persons in my life whom I have close and intimate contact to. Would also say some people are shallow and superficial. Maybe even backstabbing, but for some reason these people are not really part of my life. Apart from colleagues, neighbours, etc.
1	>I am not a horrible person but\n\nOh ? Too late.\n\nI didn't thought about it until you stated it.\n\n>I have never really been close with many people.\n\nThat's a human thing. We can't know more than about 150 people at the same time. We reached a saturation point.\n\n>I think a lot of people are incredibly shallow,superficial and will stab you in the back if given the chance. Maybe I mistyped myself even because a lot of ISFJs seem warm and nurturing and are more socially oriented. \n\nYou're just at least cynical. I don't get why it worries you : most cynics believe to be more mature than their fellow idealists.\n
1	 I prefer my own company.   I do get on with others but they can contact me, I’m over chasing people

9	Does anyone else feel like they care too much?	Happy New Year to everyone on this sub. I just found you guys, so apologies if this isn't the sort of discussion that goes on in this sub.\n\nI am ISFJ to a T almost. If you were to take [this](https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/10/17-isfjs-explain-the-one-thing-they-wish-people-understood-about-their-personalities/) list, I would tick pretty much all those boxes.\n\nI don't have too many friends, but I (key word, I) value them a lot. I put a lot of time and thought into other people's dramas/situations/struggles and I want to be appreciated for it, but I don't feel like I am. \n\nThe problem is, I get people telling me that "...oh, these people aren't your friends. There are so many other people, you can find more that will appreciate you!" but I have searched, and searched but am yet to find someone that is like this.\n\nI feel like I care too much and in the end I am the only one who is hurt or has their feelings hurt by it. What can I do? Have you had similar experiences?
6	I think the dilemma we face as ISFJs is that as we search for those in need. The problem with this is that the one thing we need most is reciprocation and it just so happens that the people we search for to help aren't able to do this because of that fact. Our peers see this as harmful for us and thus try to have us make friends with those who are able to give back to us. The problem is they most likely don't need the help we can give to them and therefore we feel guilty and not deserving that friendship. This morally makes us go back to the people we can help and the cycle continues. The best advice I can give is diversify your friend circle. 
3	I think you need to carefully ask whether the things you are caring about are the same things that others care about.\n\nFor example, my kids have never been without clothes or food. My wife puts a great amount of energy into food planning and clothes planning. Each meal has protein, fruit or vegetables, and carbs. She does a great, no, an *exceptional* job at this. She cares a *lot*.\n\nBut what she's missing is that the kids are different than she is. It would be much more healthy for them to get unbalanced meals or a pizza once in a while and have her give them the things they crave: time together, real listening to them, coloring together. But she is tone-deaf to this. The organization and the planning and the schedule comes first, and she is under the impression that the kids should appreciate her for it. And they should. But.\n\nBut they'd be so much more appreciative if *she* could appreciate the different people that they are and that the needs that they have do not match up with the needs she is projecting onto them.\n\n/u/poolboywax gets it. The ISFJ who has found maturity has found it when they realize that other people are very different, and value different things, than they do.
3	I try to treat others the way I want to be treated, but often have to remind myself that everyone has a unique way they want to be treated. Sometimes the way we want to be treated isn't the way others would want, so they might treat you a way that they would seek instead. Sounds more complicated than it is, really. Caring and reciprocation isn't black and white; we cant assume someone isn't showing us their way based on our bias and expectation of what it means to be "cared" for or "appreciated." Its important to understand the different ways people might show their value of you. \n
2	My two closest friends are ENFJ and they genuinely seem like the only two who understand and care for me to the level I invest in my friends. Not a crack to my other friends (who are almost all NPs) but it genuinely does wear on me when my friends don't understand me. I'm pretty odd and some of the stuff I say doesn't make sense to a lot of people. \n\nI wish I could find more friends, but sadly I live in a rural area and I'm not a Farmaholic(tm) so it sucks. Especially since one of my best friends lives an hour away and the other lives a continent away.
2	i felt like that with my friends for a long time too. what i eventually realized was that people are different and want and give differently. \n\ni am capable of caring more for people, in an almost motherly way, that many don't do for one another. but they do other things that i don't and they are worth noticing and appreciating. \n\nfrom there i was able to change my expectations of people. instead of basing them off of myself and what i give to others, i based them off of what i know individual others are like and are capable of.\n\nand over time we influence each other by sharing our traits. the more stubborn friend encourages me to stand my ground, the more subtle friend shows me how to be sneaky, the more polite friend shows me how to use niceties, and i try to show them how to open up and be accepting of each other.\n\nthough there are others who were unwilling to be accepting at all and are jerks so they leave the group.
1	This is me 100%. Either I naturally draw in rather toxic people in my life due to my personality and "aura" or I am just really sensitive to certain comments/tone of voice. I am still unsure of how to completely determine if someone is toxic and should be cut out of my life, or if I should just accept them for what they are and they're not as bad as my mind is making them out to be. There are also certain people who cause me a lot of grief (i.e. my parents) and I cannot cut them out no matter how much I should 
1	I'm thinking it'd be better for me if I don't make friends. I mean, just small talk with people instead. \n\nLike, chat with classmates, but don't hang out with them outside of school. Go to a coffee shop and make small talk with the cashier, if I make them smile I'll be happy. Ride a bus and chat with the guy next to you (test the fucking waters though, don't be that talkative annoying guy whose mouth ain't wanted).
4	Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, opinions?	Hey guys, kinda random post but I want to know what you think of this movie!\nI watched it yesterday for the second time and, oh the feels! What a beautiful movie! I was thinking that maybe as an ISFJ I found the movie more touching because we rely a lot on memories and have a strong emotion attached to them, I can't imagine having my memories about a past loved one erased, even if I regret it. \n\nI think that the dreamy scenes about his past memories, from childhood to all the stages of his romantic relationship, are amazing and transmit perfectly the emotions that he has associated to each memory, it gave me a feeling of nostalgia even if they were not my memories. I am rambling a bit now, so let's go with the questions: \n\nwhat's your opinion of the movie? Do you think that as ISFJs this movie can be a bit more touching for us? Would you use that technology to erase some memories of yours?\nCheers! \n
2	I'm an INTJ (subscribed here b/c my wife is ISFJ) and *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* is either my favorite or 2nd-favorite movie of all time. It's in contention with *Children of Men*.
1	One of my favorites.
1	How do I develop my Si?	Hey guys and gals, 21 M ENTP student here. \n\nI honestly wish I could be more like you all. Because of my Ti and Ne, my GPA seemed to have dropped incredibly low to the point where I don't know if I will graduate. \n\nHow do you guys manage to stay so focused? I've tried to develop habits I learnt from my ESFJ dad like writing up a schedule and trying to follow it but my Ti just takes over and I start going on wikipedia to learn about why turtles swim (for example). It works fine for about 2 weeks or so and then I just lose focus. I just don't get how I stop that from happening. \n\nIt's gotten to the point where it just gets super annoying and I end up rushing on almost every assignment and handing it in last minute. I even end up missing lunch/dinner just because I was procrastinating the entire day.
1	Sounds more like ADHD than a cognitive function thing
1	Sneaking in with some INTJ advice, hope that's OK.\n\nI would try folding in Te (ENTP's motivating function). Start keeping a log and using other measuring devices like timers. Just measure yourself and what you're doing, see what you can find out. Remember, you're a mad scientist. If you want more control over your life, you add instrumentation and measure things. And keep doing the exact kind of exploratory research you're doing here, both on the inquisition side and on the exposition side--sharing your experience so far in e.g. written form.\n\nYou may also wish to start a study group where you will guide the group through a set of productivity-oriented exercises you dug up and become a sort of host / guest lecturer. When I coach ENTPs I frequently put them on the stage and tell them to lecture me in subjects that are new to them. Make it fun.\n\nDeliberate Si practice could be risky with your energy because it's introverted and you sound pretty extraverted. It's possible that a focus on Si could just leave you more exhausted without much to show for it. I'd work on your extraverted functions first, and watch as Si and the rest fold themselves into the fractal of your daily activities automatically, in their own way, as Jung said they would.\n\nIt could also be (possibilities!) that you are studying an area that is somehow too boring, too easy, not a match for your type (does not really work Ne/Ti/Te), etc.\n\nGood luck.
5	Bias & Greatness	Due to my negative experiences with ISFJs, I think I'm biased about ISFJs. Although, I'm aware of the biases. I just wanted to say you guys are great.
6	I'm curious to know what your bias is & negative experiences were with ISFJs.....
1	Thanks :)
3	Care and keeping user guide for ISFJs?	Just like with the ISTP care and handling guide, is there something similar for ISFJs?
2	I think I've seen one on /r/ENTP.\n\nI'm not sure people here are really keen on this kind of thing, though, as selfless ISFJs are usually said to be.\n\nI, for one, would support such endeavor. It's just I have serious doubts on it feasibility, from paper. \n\nOn the other hand it just needs a few people to change my mind. In the end, it's all up to the rightful community of this sub. Just like it should be.\n\nYou have a mock-up ?
1	\n\nI have a post with most of the guides on it saved but I'm not sure how to send the link to you.
1	I'm out of the loop... What exactly are you looking for?
2	My friend wants to know more about isfj	I convinced one of my friends to take the myer-Briggs test and she tested for isfj. She doesn’t really get what that means and asked me to explain it to her. So I thought who better to ask for an explanation then other isfjs. 
2	Did she take it on the 16personality site? \n\nhttps://www.16personalities.com/isfj-personality\n\nIt has many topics. It pretty much sums it up.
1	It's better for her if she doesn't. 
1	It means she's Marge Simpson. XD
3	How to develop Ne	My mom is an ISFJ who could use some NE development. Any tips? \n\nI'm currently thinking practising fantasy writing and going to an escape room. Anything else?
1	I have no idea. If i did i'd share it. Its nice that you care about your mom and want to help her with stuff and i wish you luck. 
1	from what i read, lots of ISFJ's are attracted to logic puzzles, chess, things like that? this probably helps with Ne + Ti\n\nalso i guess forcing yourself out of your comfort zone...engaging in playful banter. stuff like that. (at least, this is what i'm trying lol)
1	INFP here, come up with as many ideas as possible. Try being a goofball. Try utilizing multiple perspectives at once.
1	ENTP here, I would recommend to not develop Ne at all. It can cause problems and decrease efficiency, just be yourself. \n\nBut regardless, I think with Ne you have to be in tune with world issues a lot more and suppress your Fe so that Ti can come in which would automatically prompt the Ne. You have to think about society a lot more and be observable and think about the problems they face and how to combat these problems. You also have to learn to hold your ground until someone provides you with a rational justification about why you would be wrong. And even if you are wrong you have to accept the fact that everyone can be wrong at some point and in the end the most rational solution produces the most results. \n\nIn short, just stop caring about what people think. 
3	ENFP + ISFJ?	I'm curious if any of you have experience with this pairing.
7	My (F)best friend (M) is an ENFP - we get on like a house on fire. But he’s also very considerate to not be overbearing and he really brings me out of my shell. He’s very attention seeking but in a way that doesn’t irritate me- more in a “class clown” type, which is funny to me. So in friendships I think it can work
4	Im a isfj and I think my boyfriend is an Enfp or a Entp. I cant remember and it doesnt help that he just skims when he reads things, so lord knows if either is correct. We did the test around teo years ago.
4	My roommate is an ENFP and he loves hanging out with introverts. His best friends tend to be intj’s, so we get along great and it’s kinda turned into a long term roommate type thing. I’m an ISFJ.\n\nWe’re both guys and both gay, but there’s nothing going on between us (I recommend the whole platonic thing for similar friend/roommate situations). It gives us plenty in common to talk about like work and games and guys. He’s got his whims which I kinda watch and try myself, like cooking or decorating. I tend to stick to my regiments a bit better than he does, but he out performs me almost every time he tries. Except in decorating to a theme, I’m better there. (I accept my inabilities and kinda find em funny, a skill he’s helped me to cultivate) \n\nHe’s strangely less of a socialite than I am, but he’s a better butterfly. When we go out together to dinner or shopping for apartment things, we kinda come off as a stable couple. I mean two guys who look comfortable together shopping for furniture or ordering food and quickly hopping back into conversation and laughing a lot can give off that vibe. However he doesn’t go out to find friends the way that I do. I like to have a ton of people who contribute to myself as a person. I like to learn from people by observation and also advice. Lots of perspectives help me feel comfortable with a decision. He’s comfortable in his own skin so he doesn’t have to do that, instead he’s kind of a social consultant. \n\nHe’s less comfortable with conflict than I am so in order to spare him the discomfort, I’ll face difficult issues that impact both of us. When we do anything with our apartment people for instance, I have a better business demeanor and tend to get my way better. He definitely helps me when it comes to things to think about or reference or bring up that I may have left out though. But I put the big boy voice to better use and can pleasantly but firmly cancel a service that’s degraded or demand an issue be looked into (i only really do that when it’s for more than just myself, I’m a fan of just biting the bullet if I’m alone). \n\nI guess what I’m trying to say is that, as an ISFJ, the ENFP who collected me makes me feel comfortable and relaxed where I would normally be anxious or mildly rude and allows me to help him where i can. It’s a very healthy give and take friendship. Romantically? No clue. 
3	They talk way too much for me most of the time. 
3	My best friend is an ENFP!! She's really wonderful, I adore her! She's very thoughtful and considerate of me, and she loves me and is totally willing to meet me on my level instead of dragging me places I don't wanna go and wearing me out. She can help bring me out of my shell and get me out of my house, but she's flexible enough that she doesn't mind if I just wanna stay home. She's also very emotionally intelligent and understanding, so she's one of few people in the world who knows me well and totally accepts me as I am, which is a really wonderful feeling. Sometimes I feel undeserving of how generally lovely she is, but she insists that she loves me anyway, so it's all good :') We also have a lot of similar interests, so we have a lot of fun talking about shows and podcasts and stuff! 
2	My work partner is an ENFP. I think we make a pretty good team (he comes up with creative ideas, I handle the logistics), but I am pretty tired of being around him at the end of the day. ENFPs can be quite draining for introverts. Thankfully, he understands that sometimes I just need to retreat to my own space.
1	I've been in an off-again, on-again relationship with an ENFP male for almost 6 yrs now. I'm an ISFJ female. His major issues with me: he finds me too sensitive, stubborn, stuck in my ways, and I want everything done in order (and traditionally, which he absolutely hates!). My major gripes with him: his inconsistency (he'll have multiple plans going, but never thinks them through at all and none ever come to fruition), his "irrational thoughts" (I sometimes feel like his head is in the clouds and I'm sitting there thinking, "Is this guy for real?"). \n\nThat said, I think it's gotten to a point where he NOW appreciates all the things that make me an ISFJ, and I've learned to appreciate him being an ENFP. It took a long ass time, and holy hell was it an emotional rollercoaster. Being almost opposites can mean a broader perspective on life and encourage the ability to have a well-rounded point of view, which is so great. \n\nAs always, take this with a grain of salt because everyone is different. But keep the communication and be open-minded and EXTREMELY patient is all I can offer.
5	What career paths are best for ISFJs?	I am one, but because of my persona or what have you, I tend to be highly indecisive. One minute, I'm rushing out my own ideas, totally in love with my thought processes; the next, I'm shooting myself down for it. "Lazy," as someone who doesn't understand would call it. All the research I've done just contradicts itself. Arts? Sciences? Maths? I love everything but hate it all the same.
11	It is considered common for most isfjs to go into something in the mental health field like being a counselor or therapist. Something that benefits others
9	I'm in graphic design, but I prefer environments where I work in cooperative teams or am helping people learn. Like I would love to get my Masters and be a professor because helping students is where I thrive. So teaching could be an option for an ISFJ too. 
3	My SO is an ISFJ and he's a firefighter. He does very well in occupations related to emergency services. 
2	Last month I've been doing an internship as a high school teacher and has been very fulfilling for me.
2	Something caring and something where you’re able to show feeling and kindness. I’m a recently discovered ISFJ (previously incorrectly typed as an INFJ) and I work in a nursery with young children... so rewarding and lovely :)
2	Have you done the Strong Interest Inventory or an assessment like that? Might help you narrow down some areas of interest, and then within those areas, just pick something- anything - and try it. There is no one "right" career, there will be several jobs/careers that will be a good fit for you. \n\nI work at a University in a student advising type of role.
11	Can ISFJs be good programmers?	I'm an ISFJ, after two years of programming I discovered that I care so much about details and the quality of my code, I never rush into coding, I think ahead and wait until everything I'm going to do is clear in my head. All of this made me slower than my peers but I think that is fine as long as I'm delivering high quality code.
10	Of course they can! I don't think that certain jobs are exclusive to specific MBTI types; however, some cognitive functions naturally compliment certain jobs. I think our natural Si organizational skills mesh well with the process of software engineering. \n\nSource: I am also a programmer.
4	Yes. \n\nThough I know exactly what you mean and have done (and sometimes still do) the same thing.  Learning to fully understand and decompose a problem into sane/manageable pieces is something that just came with experience.  \n\nWe tend to be perfectionists, and that can work against us in some cases. You have taken the most important step in simply recognizing that. 
4	Programmer here. I like the creative aspects of my job I don't enjoy testing but definitely enjoy formatting stuff to look great. Aesthetics is key for me.
3	I hope so as that's how I've chosen to make a living.\n\nOne thing to consider is putting in skeleton code or stubs as placeholders to get you started. I find that helps me to get over the hump of trying to work everything out first.\n\nOnce I have the structure then I can go back and do the bulk of the details.
2	Computer geek here. Care to show ? I don't much care about the language : structure is my jam.\n\nAnd any respite from noodle coding crap will be more than welcome !
0	We'll allow it.....this time. \n\nhttp://i1.whatsmovingindia.com/sites/default/files/owl8.jpeg
6	How do you grieve?	in light of the recent passing of Jonghyun (a kpop idol), my friends and i were distraught about the news. we're not totally fans but we empathize with his situation and are saddened with he probably have been through. anyway, i know my friends are still super sad about it and can hardly listen to his songs or anything related to him. but for me, i just cried myself to sleep that first night and then the next day i just can't cry anymore. and it still hurts whenever i remember what happened.\n\nnow i know everyone has their own way of coping (stages of grief, etc) but for me i hate crying. i feel like i would be a burden to other people if they see me crying. so i'd rather be their shoulder to cry on and cry by myself when i get some alone time.  or maybe distance myself from my sadness. but as it is, i can only count a few times when i've cried for myself. it's like i'm more welcoming of other people's pain than entertain my own which i think is not healthy. is this normal? although it's also occurred to me that i'm probably just depressed.\n\nthoughts?
5	I pretty much only cry for myself, but I always do it privately. I can only think of a few times I've cried in front of another person, and even when it's someone I love and trust I still find it humiliating and it makes me feel bad about doing that to the other person. \n\nOverall I tend not to cry very much, though. Sometimes I'll have bouts where I cry 3 times in a week, other times I'll go 6 months without so much as a sniffle. I'm bad at grieving though, honestly. I have trouble giving myself permission to feel those things, and I tend to propel myself away from emotions like sadness and mourning. It kinda messes me up worse than just being sad would, but I feel like I don't know *how* to feel those things properly sometimes. Like I know I'm avoiding them, but I'm terrified of what would happen if I just let them hit me and there's an instinctive drive to avoid them. \n\nSo yeah, my "mourning" tends to be brief and private. Partly because I don't wanna burden others, partly because I don't really know what to do aside from bury the feeling and move on as fast as I can. 
3	This is exactly how I respond to grief too. When my grandfather died, I told myself that it was my responsibility to be the emotional support shoulder for my family to lean on, and that I could not allow myself to cry in front of them. I just bottled up the grief until I could let it out away from everyone else.\n\nI doubt that this is a healtly way to respond to grief, but I do it nonetheless.
3	When my brother died in October I knew I would have time to grieve my own way, but I knew my family needed my support more than I needed to immediately grieve. I’ve always been like this. When something major happens my personal emotions shut down and I become a support pillar for whoever needs it. 
2	I cry easily, but I am more relieved when I cry alone. I also don't want to bother or worry anyone. When I saw my dad almost die four years ago, I was very distressed but I would say I managed the situation the best I could, and I know I did it that way for my younger sister, who was also at home but sleeping. Through his though months of recovery, even if I wanted to cry everyday I would do it in private (or with my SO presence at most). I took most of the weight in my shoulders to relief my sister of the burden, I visited my dad in the rehabilitation center almost everyday even if he was +1h away from my home and I had to go to classes, study for exams, etc. I didn't like to imagine him alone surrounded by other damaged people, it was a very depressing picture.\n\nISFJs are very protective of their loved ones and because of that, even in tough situations, we don't want to add more discomfort or worries. I would say in this kind of scenarios we may appear as one of the toughest types even if we are breaking apart inside. 
1	I don't cry at easily, and when I do it's always by myself. I don't like others seeing that vulnerable side of me. I do like to be that pillar as you mentioned always there to hear their grief and be by their side. 
1	I just let myself cry and trust that I will be ok. I find my emotions humiliating and have found there is no one, and I mean no one, who could make me feel better when I’m grieving than if I just processed it alone. Often I research advice though, find some mantras and distractions.
1	As an ESFJ married to an ISFJ, I just read this to my husband and insinuated it sounds just like him.  He said "I don't know what you're talking about."  So thank you for showing me he's not alone in his way of grieving.
2	I’m an ESTJ guy who’s into an ISFJ girl, can anyone give some advice??	Hello ISFJs! Anything will help, but here’s some details: Long story short, I’ve been into this girl for way too long and gone nowhere. We’ve been on a few informal dates randomly over the past few years, but nothing more has happened. The word ‘awkward’ comes up way too much between us and is probably the best way to describe our interactions. I honestly feel like I really don’t know her as she has never even slightly ‘opened up’ to or around me, she is very quiet and seemingly anxious. In other words, it seems like her personality hides like a turtle in it’s shell whenever I’m around. But somehow I can’t seem to get my mind off of her. I admit, I see her as being very attractive, but do also admire her personal traits. At this point I feel like I might have tried too many times (like planning one date which is followed by nothing). But still we ‘text first’ just as much as each other. \nPlease help, I’m really confused, can’t get her off of my mind, but am hesitating to even initiate conversation one more time. \nThanks! \n
4	ISFJs are typically reserved around people until we warm up to them, at which point we become more comfortable (this usually takes me several weeks of regular interaction). It seems to me that in your case, you just haven't been around each other enough yet for her to open up to you on the next level.\n\nTake the initiative and make it clear that you are interested. You have to be the one to get the ball rolling. If you begin to open yourself emotionally to her and she is actually interested, she will probably respond in kind. ISFJs are like an emotional onion, and it takes some time and effort to work your way through the layers.
2	My ISFJ told me she gets nervous around ESTJs. We discussed the fact that the ESTJ is the ISFJ's natural supervisor (in Socionics Model A) and she said she thinks there's something to that. ESTJs don't really seem to take her feelings/information as seriously as she'd like, and the information/feelings coming from ESTJs can hit her pretty hard in a very direct way. When she gets feedback from ESTJs or even just a response, it is often corrective in nature. Just sharing this in case it helps you figure out how she may be experiencing your relationship.

11	I'm happy.	A few years ago I asked for advice on here about an ISFJ friend of mine who grew more and more toxic and keep pushing me away. I met up with her yesterday and it was great. She had changed drastically and apologized for how she had pushed me away and for her toxic behavior. \n\nShe is trying to be more open and forgiving to others and to not let a judgmental mindset dictate her day to day life. and she wishes to reconnect and be friends again. I was worried about her for so long and can finally feel relief that she was able to pull herself out of her downward spiral and that she found a path to be happy and accepting of herself and others.\n\nI am so unbelievably happy about this and just wanted to share this with someone without it being like gossiping to other people in my life. \n\nold post from way before about this: https://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/3p473m/im_an_isfj_and_i_need_help_with_another_isfj/
3	That must feel so nice! I am happy that she changed that much in these years and that you have recovered a good friend for whom you were worried about. That makes a good day! 
5	Very quiet...	Where is everybody?
18	It's usually like this around here. There's not that many of us and I don't think most of us spend enough time thinking about MBTI to warrant a lot of posts, honestly. Plus I'm pretty sure a lot of us are kinda shy. \n\nI think we get almost as many posts from other types going "help me how do I ISFJ" as from ISFJs ourselves lol. 
3	I found this board last night and have been unable to tear myself away. I can't believe some of the posts I have read; many thoughts and feelings I have never been able to articulate to another person. Of course I just read and read, saying nothing but trying to take it all in.. your post made me want to make an account. Hi!
4	Compared to the INFJ subreddit, I think it’s fitting that we ISFJs don’t post much on here considering we’re probably out pondering things in the real world 
3	Yo.
3	I'm a quite ISFJ. So I guess we're just quite around here :)
2	hi! i like to read posts on this subreddit but i’m shy to post. i would love to make friends with some isfj’s though, i don’t think i’ve met many in my life. 
2	hello \n\n\n*waves shyly*
2	hi!
2	hi friends :^)\n
1	This type seems really laid back... chill!
2	How do you act when you’re high?	What’s your response to the weeeedd? Are you quiet, talkative, etc?
7	I'm usually a bit more talkative and just more relaxed in general. I'm usually with people that I enjoy being around so I'm also a good amount happier than I usually am.  Overall, weed really helps me in being more "normal".
6	I think it depends on several factors like weed strain, the mood I have, or if I am alone or not (and with whom). Sometimes I feel energized and very talkative and I feel like "thinking out of the box", or at least different from my usual line of thought. Some other times I am chill and happy, I may be quiet but in a very good mood. And sometimes, if I am in a company that I am not very close to, or I am stressed for work, I can get a bit paranoid, very selfconscious and "trapped in my thoughts, like my worries get amplified. But this last situation I would say is the least common. I luv weed. \n
4	I’m good if I’m with one or two people.  Any more than that, I go silent (especially if I’m too high).  It’s more manageable if I’m with close friends.
3	I get sooooo sleepy.  All strains, although def worse with indica.  Also I get super weird about people touching me.  Other than that pretty normal stoner talk stuff 
2	When I used to smoke I used to get really paranoid and sleepy , didn’t like the feeling at all and quit right away . 
2	When I get high I just start relaxing and chilling. If I smoke enough I definitely get couch lock and the munchies. I usually become pretty quiet. I love weed sometimes I’ll smoke a little before going to bed so I can fall asleep 
2	Im giggly at first and have to touch certain soft things because things feel different to me when im high, but then I get sleepy. 
2	do people of different types really act a certain way when they're high? i thought stoned is stoned lol
14	Overwhelmed by the need for details?	I get frustrated that I can rarely contribute to conversations because I fear that I don't know enough about the topic so I can't give a very objective answer to counteract what the person initially told me. At the same time, when I go back and force myself to read more on topics, I get overwhelmed by the amount of information that exists, where to start looking for information, how the hell does anyone memorize all this stuff to paint a clearer picture of a topic in their mind to then determine said thoughts and opinions to remain objective, etc. So then it turns out I have very little to say in social situations at all >.<
8	My imperfect solution for that is too keep learning things until i have a large source to draw from and it gets weird and people think I'm intuitively connecting dots and ideas.\n\nThe other thing I do is admit I know little to nothing of a particular topic and that I'm kinda in "learn mode".\n\nEnough "learn modes" and you'll find you can start feeling confident giving input.
3	oh my god you put it into words. This is so awful for me 
3	Wooing an ISFJ?	Hi all! So I met an ISFJ through a dating app, and I'm having a good time talking to her over text. Over the course of our conversations, she told me how she hates the idea of saying we met on a dating app to be the story of how we met, being a hopeless romantic. I've suggested that this hurdle can be surmounted by making the first meeting in person the substitute for the "how we met" story, and she concurred, though she added that it would have to be pretty memorable. So basically what I'm asking is, what would be the best ways to make a good impression on an ISFJ on the first date/get together? And on a more general scale, what does are the things that an ISFJ would most appreciate in a relationship? \n\nAddendum: I've tested as a ISFP when it comes to how I process information by default, but often exhibit ISTP traits in action, so I'm wondering how this may affect our dynamic in the long term if we start going out. Thanks for the feedback ahead of time!
3	i'd pretend to be a stranger when you two "bump" into each other for the first time. you know? i'd like, playfully make it like you two just met and are clicking right off the bat.\n\nother than that, iono, with dating advice, most of the time i say "be open, be honest, and see where it goes". the open and honest thing is what we isfj love.
2	Surprise her with something that goes along with her personality or something she likes. I mentioned I was a vegetarian through our prior conversations and on our first date my now BF had ordered vegetarian nachos as an appetizer prior to my arrival. It meant a lot that he listened to our conversations.
1	I would guess it’s important to her that your “ meet cute” story aligns with the narrative in her head about her own life, so it may involve a hobby you two share, a chance encounter at a cool social gathering or place that means something to both of you
3	What are your gift ideas for this Christmas?	I think ISFJ's are pretty good on gift-giving (prove that I'm not wrong! ) and I would like to know about what are you planning to give, and to whom! Yes, you are right.. I also want to steal some ideas from you :P
3	Ohh I'm *so* bad at gift giving haha, I hate it and it scares me... Fortunately my family doesn't care much about gifts, so the only ones I'm giving are stockings I'm gonna crochet for my best friend and her boyfriend. I'm going to buy the yarn today and they're gonna be hideous, it'll be amazing. 
2	when i give gifts i cater them to the person i'm giving them to based on their interests and hobbies and whatever. for an artist friend that has a clean and neat home filled with pretty things, i got her a cute metal bird sculpture. for a friend that loves old stuff with history i got him a heavy old school lock and key. iono, stuff like that. give to people based on what they love.\n\nbut i stopped giving gifts. those examples are from before. now i give favors and help.
2	I have just a couple people I’m shopping for this year , my cousin is really into science and books so I’m going to get him an aquatic eco system from amazon and he’s been talking about ready player one book so I will also be getting him that . I have a co worker who she love sanitizers so I get her a set from bath and body works when they have he annual sale . 
1	I keep lists on my phone. Whenever I hear a friend, family, or my SO mention something I put a note in. For instance, every time my SO watched Narcos he mentioned how much he loved Peña’s jackets. So for Christmas I hunted high and low in vintage shops to find a replica leather jacket. Now I just hope it fits! \n 
1	I won't claim that I'm a great gift giver myself. But one of my friends is studying abroad next semester, and I got her for our secret santa thing, so I gave her a scratch off map of the world (where you scratch off every country you've been to) as well as a neck pillow for the long flight ahead of her!
1	Blankets, practical things that will be of use (i have a lot of ISTP friends) and food. About to bring on the cookie train for my coworkers tomorrow!
5	Is this common?	Hey guys, so I have an ISFJ at work who just turned 18. And I've noticed she makes jokes about not being wanted or that nobody likes her. Now this I know is nowhere near true. Everyone who talks about her enjoys her on some level and I haven't heard anything from anyone about actually having a problem with her or not liking her.\n\nIs it common to believe that you're not liked? Do you think it has more to do with her depression than her type? We've talked a little bit about depression, mostly just an acknowledgment that we both have it and it's difficult, but other than that she says it's not really something she talks about which I get. \n\nFinally what would be the best way to let her know that she's liked? without it possibly being misconstrued as me hitting on her or confessing my feelings (long story, but I used to like her; she says she doesn't like me. So I don't want to come off in a more than friendly way) \n\nI'm an INTJ so I'm really not good with this kind of thing but still want to help a little if I can. Thanks in advance guys :)
7	I don’t know about other ISFJs but I feel the same as that girl like 90% if the time. I just feel like people have to like me cause I’m already here not because they actually do.\n\nI wouldn’t call myself depressed just feel like the only person I can rely on is myself. People constantly disappoint me, so I don’t find a point in believing that I’m actually liked enough to be considered a friend.\n\nAnyway to those that I think truly like me as a person. They’re usually the people that don’t seem like they’re just checking the box. By that I mean going down a list of what a “good” friend is and doing only that.\n\nMake me feel appreciated and go out of your way for me that’s how I’ll truly know.
6	ISFJ Male, here. Hey INTJ, I have a couple INTJ acquaintances who are rather helpfully and appreciatively direct like this, so I understand where you are coming from. Note, she may genuinely appreciate you being direct, that does not mean she will also reciprocate or open up. If you still like her, just be neutral until she warms up... sometimes we change our minds after we get to know someone more even if nothing actually changed.\n\nYes... this is common for us. Personally, I don't care all that much if someone "likes me" as a person. Yay, you think I'm cool. Or not, whatever, I'll spend time with those who do. If she is like me, this probably stems more from being lonely. I can be in a room full of people familiar with me, even a few close to me, and still feel utterly alone and misunderstood. Yeah, most of them enjoy my presence, but when I reach out to someone, rejection is a consistent experience. We laugh about it and makes jokes, yet that's just us having fun at our own expense. Being liked and being friends are different (100% agree). In the same way, being enjoyed and accepted socially is different from being wanted and accepted personally (intimately?). It feels like a paradox, even to those of us who live in that daily.\n\nI could be off on this though, I'm an atypical ISFJ anyway apparently. ShadowMelman could be right too, I have another ISFJ friend who makes jokes about himself or me (because we were close) more often than other people... it's just his way.
1	My guess is that she wants to socialize and be liked and the easiest way she sees doing that is by making jokes. She doesn't want to hurt anyone elses feelings therefore she makes jokes about herself.
6	ISFJ here who needs advice on dealing with emotions	Hey all, I would greatly appreciate any and all advice I can get on dealing with negative emotions (usually feeling sad or anxious). Right now dealing with some health issues that my husband has and it feels so overwhelming. If I am able to encourage myself for a few minutes, it usually doesn't last long.\nI am willing to do what it take... I wish so badly to be in control of my emotions, or, better yet, wish I didn't even have emotions. Have any of you had success in dealing with this type of thing?
6	I would recommend you look into CBT, the most effective therapy available for depression. Because our negative emotions stem from our negative thoughts, the easiest way to cultivate positive emotions is to have positive thoughts. I know this sounds super empty and fake, like "just think happy thoughts and you'll be happy!" which is actually terrible. And it is a little more complex than that, with specific responses to specific ways that we believe the worst about the world.\n\nI've been reading a book called Feeling Good by David Burns, and its written for a wide audience. You might like it.\n\nhttps://positivepsychologyprogram.com/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-techniques-worksheets/\n\nThat's a pretty good intro, and it's pretty detailed too. Good luck. =]
2	I'm pretty new to this and actually helping myself by learning about my type & using different resources to guide myself, the best advice I'd give myself from what I've learned so far if I were in your shoes as an ISFJ is: to take it easy on yourself, don't be so exacting & overcritical with yourself if you feel like you're not able to be the "be all & end all" for someone else., \n\nOur first step should be to heal ourselves before we can be of any real help to others. \n\nWe have to learn to take things easy as an ISFJ and realize that we can't fix everything and neither is it our place to do so.\n\nThe best way to help others is by empowering them rather than putting all the pressure & responsibility on ourselves to help them.\n\nNot sure if this resonates for you but that's what I'd tell myself. :) 
2	Sorry I'm a little late on this, but I can really empathize with how you feel. In addition to the CBT suggestion a poster already recommended, also do a little search on ACT (Acceptance-Commitment Therapy) and a book called "The Happiness Trap." It talks about how people often try to ignore/get rid of negative emotions and then those emotions keep rearing their ugly heads until you can fully acknowledge and accept them. Also, meditation!
1	Hi I sometimes put a lot of pressure on myself about getting something done, but there is no time to do it or it is realistically could not be done. Then I keep trying to do it again and again, but couldn't get to it or make it come true. I just tell my mind, this can't be done and it will be okay if I fail to do this, so stop putting more energy into it. So if your mind start to strangle you, just find a way out or a space. Think of thoughts like it's okay if this is not done or this do not happen, it will be okay. I can cope. There is another way out. It's not a big deal as I think it is. The world will not end if I don't finish this. This is just something that works for me. I'm not saying to give up, but to let go what can't be done and replace it with something you can achieve.
1	now this could just be a option for only those who is not too feeling and feeling is kinda the whole isfj deal but what you could try is forming a logical reason why hes going to be fine that the chances are on his side so theres no real point in worrying he will be fine combine that with a cat video some sleep and you should have yourself a happy day

1	If we were on /r/entp, I would have gone to my usual point about how much discord servers are linked there, relying on the concept of sensory overstimulation.\n\nBut here, I'll have to ask you a question before :\n\n * Why here ? You know about the proportion of each type on Internet, right ? You know this subreddit it rather calm, to put it as  politely as I can, right ?
2	as an infp how i view si?	so i had a great view of how my si works,it usualy comes out more when im a bit stressed as iv noticed in myself,and this guy that i know well made a strange reaction to a joke i made,and somehting in me was telling me something,all of a sudden three past evens just came together to give me that insight that he wasnt happy at the jokes i made,so with si,all past experinces are connected in a web,and each point of the web when it ripples throughout the rest of the si web,so hes reaction seemed slightly off,because in the si web,i already saw that same reaction when he was angry or pissed,make sense?
3	Personality Test With Functions	Hi :) Couple weeks ago I asked for a help with testing one personality test. A lot of people told to use cognitive functions. We did it. Please try test again and comment your result. \n\nIt's Free. No registration required. Congitive functions used. :) \n\nhttps://www.horozo.com/personality-type-test
2	I got ISFJ-A! I dunno what the "A" part means, but you got my type right!
1	Well wtf, now im a freaking ISFP, thx for ruining my day
1	I also got ISFP... I wasn't expecting that result. I'm really curious about it now though lol
7	ISFJ's who struggle with anxiety, what's the best way that your partner can help you get through it when it rears it's head (if any)	Hi ISFJ's! So I met a really sweet girl and we've been getting to know each other, she's an ISFJ and I'm an INFJ, and she mentioned that she has some pretty bad anxiety at times. I really want to be sensitive to that struggle and respond to it as appropriately and compassionately as possible if and when it comes up. So my question to you guys is, what's the best way (in your minds) that someone can respond when you're really feeling it in a given moment? Is there anything that I could do that would make it better, or is it best to just let her find her own way through it?\n\nThanks for your insight!
7	I'll add that it depends on what is triggering it. ISFJs can go through intense emotions at times, we are very exacting & tough on ourselves, a good reminder at that time from someone else can be in form of appreciation of what we do because we're seldom appreciated & recognized. We also take things very seriously and burn ourselves out internally, so sometimes help can be in the form of a loving, caring reminder to lighten up and not takes things so seriously. These are a couple things that work for me when coming from a close family member. Try to find out what triggers it, that will give you clues as to your next steps. \n\nThere can be other things that are triggering it as well. We also have anxiety when we're faced with new stimuli, some change from the norm, in that scenario a good reminder is to tell us to not panic & give this new thing an opportunity to unfold and let it take its course. We're not good at embracing change. Also, we have a huge backlog of repressed feelings, so that can catch up to us very quickly and be a cause of anxiety, in that case a good form of help would be to encourage us to not bottle our feelings up so much and to regularly be aware of how we're feeling and to express our feelings in a healthy way before they build up too much. Another source of anxiety for us is conflict, in that scenario what works for me is to not engage in conflict and in some cases realizing that a particular environment is too toxic, and the healthiest option is to no longer be a part of that toxic environment. So you see there are different causes of anxiety for us and different things help to deal with that at different times. \n\nAlso unconditional love and reassurance from a close person in our life, as mentioned in the other comment is always a good thing as well, can't go wrong with that as the base of your interactions when your partner is anxious but these are some additional things to ponder as well on top of that.\n\n
4	My anxiety is mostly manageable, but it does sometimes give me problems.\nI'm dating an ESFJ, and he's been fantastic every time I've had trouble with that.\n\nUsually he just hugs me really tight, and either listens to me (if I feel the need to talk about it and have a bit of a word-dump), or he calms me down by telling relatable stories of things he's been through. \n\nHe also reassures me that he's gonna be there for me through whatever it is that I'm stressing about, and no matter what, I'll have him, which is really comforting to me, because when I go through a period of intense anxiety, I tend to develop a mentality of "the sky is falling", and I catastrophize everything, so just knowing that I don't have to worry about him taking off is one less thing for me to panic about.
3	If they're there with me, then holding me or holding my hand or otherwise touching me in a comforting way would help immensely (factoring in being a Physical Touch person) - though I'm talking about my SO here and not just any person. \n\nReassuring phrases that counteract the negative things I'm saying. Reminders that I'm safe, that I'm not x negative trait, etc. Talking me through it if it's very serious, or making me laugh/forget about it's something minor. 
9	What is our biggest blind spot as ISFJ's?	I'm hoping since we would have similar blind spots, we can help/encourage each other through this. I'm very new to feeling resonance with this personality type and feel a bit overwhelmed after reading up on some of the pitfalls we are most prone to. I feel kinda dumb that I lived for 38 years without being aware of all this. I think it will be nice to just write out all the things we need to work on and have a group of people in the same boat as a support group!
19	One of my biggest weaknesses is not being able to express my feelings/opinions if I suspect it could lead to a "conflictive" situation.\n\nI also have issues when evaluating my self worth, for example when it comes to my value as an employee. Sometimes I don't value my own achievements the same way I would value others'.\n\nThe good thing is that being aware of my weaknesses really helps when trying to solve them.. But sometimes it's not easy and I cut myself some slack.. :P
9	I feel like my biggest blind spot is other people haha... I always feel like I'm very self-centered, honestly. I'm trying to learn to be better, but a lot of the things that seem to come naturally to other people (or the kind of other people I admire, at least) are things that would never occur to me. The way they check in with others, finding gifts for people, reaching out so easily.... \n\nIt feels really shameful to admit, but I just don't think about other people that way. When I look at an item I think about what *I* think about it, if *I* like it, not who else in my life might. When I see other people, I think about how *I* feel, what *I* want to tell them. It's really hard for me to get in other people's heads and think about what I could be giving to improve their lives as opposed to the kind of relationship I want with them or how I want them to perceive me. \n\nI dunno, that might just be a me thing as opposed to an ISFJ thing, but I'm curious if anyone else relates to that feeling. I don't think I usually behave selfishly, but I *think* selfishly. 
8	One of my big weaknesses that I've been trying to work on is being more assertive about my needs. As an ISFJ, I have this feeling like it's my duty to sacrifice my wellbeing for the good of others. This isn't necessarily a bad urge to have, but in some situations it's totally unreasonable to act on it.\n\nFor example: if my work partner asks me to take over a project for him, my first inclination is to say yes, even if I am completely overloaded with projects of my own. I also have a friend who will message me at all hours of the day asking me to help her write college papers, and I always feel obligated to help her, even if it's extremely inconvenient for me. She often tries to make me feel guilt for not helping her (in a passive-aggressive sort of way), so in the past I usually caved and helped her.\n\nIt's good for ISFJs to remember that some people do, in fact, try to take advantage of our generosity, and it's totally ok to say no to these people!
5	My post reminds me of this from the book The True ISFJ by Truity:\n\n"Under the calm exterior of an ISFJ there will often lay a bubbling cauldron of disapproval and discontent."\n\nSo other personality types are not like this? It's something specific to us? I would definitely agree that I'm my own worst critic and a very tough one at that. This is one of my biggest challenges and goes along with the perfectionist in us.
2	Thinking out of the box and being creative when it is needed.  \n\nIsfjs tend to be a victim of their own mind  due to their lack of innovative ideas to fight their mental demons and win them quickly. \n\n

1	reddit chat	hey ISFJ people, anyone wanna test out the new reddit chat function with me?
2	I volunteer if you haven't tested it yet! 
2	Hello	Right now the ISFJ type resonates with me (38/m) the most. I believe as we evolve, we associate ourselves with different personality types. Previously I thought I was an INFP, but that no longer resonates with me. Maybe I'm answering and understanding the personality type questions more clearly and answering with more awareness now. Does anybody have a similar experience? Either way, it's good to communicate/connect with ISFJ's.
6	Hmm, for a long time when I was taking the quizzes I would bounce back and forth between INFJ and ISFJ, but after reading up on cognitive functions, I can say pretty certainly that I'm ISFJ. I've had moments where I've questioned if maybe I'm INTP since it's the same functions in a different order, but ISFJ definitely resonates most overall. \n\nPersonally I don't really believe type changes over the course of a person's life, but you might grow and change and become a more or less healthy/mature version of your type, which could make you appear to be something other than what you are. That's just my personal opinion on it though, other interpretations of MBTI are totally valid! 
3	i've always been somewhere between isfj and istj and i still really resonate with both personality profiles.
2	Hello and welcome! In my case the first three times I did the test (with some years in between) I always got ISFJ. It is now that sometimes I got mistyped as an INFJ!
1	Update	So a week on from my post.\n\nMy ENTP friend has given up on me. I was too much for her to handle. Basically she thinks I am a creep like everyone says I am. An incident happened that was totally unintentional but she didnt believe that. Not to mention she couldnt deal with me. It sucks but is what it is. She just proved to me I cant keep friends. Also makes me think everything good she ever said to me was bullshit. I will be seeing someone because my life is fucked up and I nearly killed myself Saturday night and have been feeling that way for the last couple of days. She or no one else knows that. But yeah. I need help. Unfortunately I am going to get it alone. Maybe some day people will like me and see good in me. But a few of you said I should see someone and I will. That is the first step. Need to control these feelings and have people see the good in me that deep down I see.
5	OP, it's good that you're getting help, and I promise you it doesn't matter that you're getting help alone. I hope that as you attend therapy sessions you begin to realize the impact your negative thoughts have on your well being and start to change those patterns. You can have friends, and you can have good, healthy relationships with other people. And regardless of your past, you are worth it. So please don't give up hope yet. You're doing good enough right now.
2	Accounting as a second career?	I have a bachelor’s degree in public health and have been considering going back to school for a different degree for quite some time. I’ve heard several times that accounting was a good career for isfjs, and I’ve been thinking about getting a second degree in it. I was wondering if anyone here would recommend getting a second bachelors in it? It would take me about 2-3 years of going to school part time. I’m attracted to the career because of the different places you can work, stability, and ability to be self-employed. But is accounting a regular 9-5 job, or does it require a lot of travel and weekends? Any insight would be helpful, thank you :) 
2	is a bachelors necessary? I looked into getting a second bachelors at one point, but a professor pointed out to me that since I already had that, I really should just take the prerequisite courses and get a masters instead, which looks better to just about anyone. Of course, there might be a ton of prerecs and it would just add unnecessary time to your schooling. Just a thought!
2	Need some help :)	Hello, guys :) I'm MBTI fan and trying to help my friend. He own small social network where main feature is Questions Game - people talk to each with pre-prepared questions or use their own questions list. The main idea to filter users and show related members are totally oposite options: 1) compatible members by zodiac sign 2) compatible by personality type. So, he created personality test which contains 32 questions. I want you to ask to take that test and tell is it accurate or not :) \n\nYou don't need to create an account or login to take test, but you can create it if you like the idea and want to try other features :) So, link to test is: \n\nhttps://www.horozo.com/personality-type-test\n\nAny comments, ideas, critics are welcome!
2	On the paper, it'd be really surprising to me it works. It also reminds me of those two or three dead MBTI based dating websites that remain taking dust in my browser's bookmark bar.\n\nI fear the same fate awaits your friend's idea.\n\nI take the test, and tell you my specific thought just here in an edit.\n\n---\n\nEDIT :\n\nI usually get annoyed by online tests because of the lack of precision in answering. Those knobs are great !\n\nThe question are rather ambiguous. It's a good thing : I struggled to hack it.\n\nThere is no explanation for the proposition of compatible types. I suppose your friend used MBTI's data of couple stability by type. It's rather notoriously unreliable. The alternative is Socionics intertype relationships, and it's not much better.\n\nI think instead of replicating the same biases about that, how about letting people searching by type by themselves instead ? \n\nHow about pulling up a test about what type you'd like your yet to be SO be ? That could be great.\n\nOverall, I'm surprised about how thoughtfully made it is. It's already a better testing than the overwhelming majority of online test I filled.
1	INTJ, but I got ISFJ, which actually really surprised me. However, I could easily attribute this to subtly becoming more like an ISFJ I'm attempting to court atm. I was also fairly in the middle on all grounds, with 59% sensing and 53% feeling. I'm a big fan of the percentage bars in the results.\n\nI actually don't like the sliding knobs in the questions, if only because they don't have anchors, which would usually be the numbers on a Likert scale. I'm in a Tests and Measurement class and this was literally on the test today so I can back this up. :) When I was not entirely in agreement or disagreement on a question I would usually just leave the slider around the middle, where the 25% or 75% marks would be. Does this make sense? I actually really like their aesthetic value and I think they would be more useful if your friend could make them longer, with more space to move the slidey.\n\nI like how it gives you the results and immediately tells you compatible types and invites you to search for other users of those types. I'm not a fan of the compatible types stuff, but again, tying to attract someone outside that range so ofc.\n\nI also really like the inclusions of the zodiac, but I'd really like to see other personality measures like Hogwarts house, Enneagram, uhhhh NEO-PI maybe? Stuff like that. :)
7	What are your reddit habits?	Hey fellow ISFJs! It's not really a secret we are under-represented on the online reddit MBTI community; yet, there are 3,246 subscribers to our sub. That's quite a number.\n\nSo my question is: what are your reddit habits? Are you a lurker? Do you go on posting streaks and suddenly stop for a long period of time? Or maybe you only comment and never make submissions.\n\nWithout trying to draw any major conclusions from comments on this post, I think it'd be interesting to see where everyone fits in. I tend to use reddit in a *weird* way (only comment occasionally and scroll through very often).\n\nPerhaps it's related to the amount of redditors of our type?
26	I'm definitely a lurker but I've been commenting more often because I'm trying to raise my karma high enough to participate in a sub. Typically though I just scroll through, upvote occasionally, and *rarely* comment
6	Mostly lurk unless I have a comment I feel strongly enough to make. 
3	I hardly ever comment, but I like to comment on things that help people research, either about themselves or a topic. I feel like it helps all of us figure out more about ourselves and gives us a community where we can feel like there are others like us.
3	I tend to lurk a moderate amount, but I don't *avoid* commenting. I probably comment or reply to things anywhere from once every two or three days to 10+ times a day depending on my mood, energy level, and how much the topics being posted interest me. I only occasionally post threads of my own, though. Contributing to a discussion is one thing, but making a post of my own feels way riskier/more embarrassing so I tend to only do it once in a while. \n\nThat said, I also tend to stick to a few favorite subs. I tend to scroll through individual subs more often than my feed, because there are only a few subs I follow where I really enjoy the community and content. My feed tends to be more spammy since I follow a lot of subs because I think they could be useful and don't want to lose track of them more than because I genuinely enjoy viewing their content. That also means it can make me a little anxious to just scroll through my feed, and scrolling through the popular/trending posts even more so. I still do those things once in a while, but I would say I mostly use reddit to lurk/participate in specific communities.
2	I just found this place so, hello!\n\nI would say that I come off as a lurker but I'll go on posting streaks then chill.  I also delete a lot of my old posts except for ones on private subreddits.  Don't feel the need for everyone to see where I'm posting all the time.
2	I lurk a lot and occasionally I’ll go on a posting streak and then stop for a few days to either lurk or just ignore Reddit. 
2	I usually only contribute if I have a point to make or something to say on a topic that really interests me. I wind up posting a lot because I only frequent the subs geared towards them. There are exceptions however; I also like to be controversial sometimes if I lurk a strange sub and see something that Sparks my interest. Even though I'm an ISFJ, I do like to get into a heated discussion from time to time to keep my brain active on slow days. I prefer confrontation online because I get to respond in my own time and thing my argument through more than I would in a one on one discussion about a topic. 
2	I am The Lurk. I comment here the most which is, an ok amount. I also post here the most which is very little. Mostly I'm reading comments and trying to get a feel for how pockets of other people think about stuff and what they know.
1	Like many others, I only comment when I think I have something to add, but I rarely if ever make a thread unless I have a very specific point in doing so. Otherwise I'm very much a lurker. 
1	I lurk a lot and comment when I feel like I can add something to the conversation or feel particularly strong about something. 
6	a question to the isfjs?	hey so i just read some of dario nardi's work about the neuroscience of personality,and he has done brain scans on the different mbti types,and it turns out that isfjs are the most right brained out of all the types,and this got me interested.so 1)do you guys feel like you very visual people,that its easier to learn from visual material,2) do you guys feel very intuitive about things people nature ect.?...and what kind of creative things do you liek to think about?
8	I am very visual when it comes to learning and putting things together. I see instructions putting together furniture or something and it will take hours. If Im shown i can pick it up easily.\n\nI have great intuition, very observant and will remember key things people say to me.\n\nI also daydream
2	1. Yes, I am a visual learner first and foremost. I grasp things most readily when it's displayed in front of me.\n\n2. I believe I have good intuition. I'm observant which helps.\n\n3. daydreams and stories. I'll have music on my mind when I listen to it and art when I see it
2	1. I’m also a visual learner, I find it hard to understand new concepts without being able to see it or work with it directly.\n\n2. On the myers briggs, I only tested as a sensor slightly over an intuitive. So I do think that I’m intuitive and can use my observations to make educated guesses.
2	Ya Im very intuitive about the nature of people. I wonder how being left handed affects the alrdy right-brained-ness of isfjs.
2	Yes it's much easier to learn from visual stimulus and also I rely a lot on vision to memorize experiences. I enjoy observing every detail.\n\nI would say I am pretty intuitive, the test was almost 50/50. I don't know if that means anything. But I catch things easily, read between and I would say I perceive other's mood states with few clues.\n\nI have realized I daydream a lot, many times is about things that generates an emotional reaction/feeling in me. Also I try to explore my creativity learning how to play ukelele. My SO always tells me I am very good with rythm, but sometimes I feel I am very rigid and don't 'loosen up'. I also would like to learn to draw properly. 
2	I learn best when I am being shown what to do and am allowed to ask questions. \n\nI have really good intuition for the most part, but it can get easily over shadowed by what I WANT to believe, rather than what is actually in my face.\n\nI day dream about my future (which sometimes as of late causes horrible spiraling) I watch A LOT of TV and movies, it's kinda obscene, I read a lot, sometimes I write (but I don't think I'm very good at it) I listen to music and I LOVE to make music with people I love.
2	reference & or citation please? I would think that perceivers or intuitors would be more right brained...
5	Can anyone relate. New to this.	\n\n\n\n\nAn ENTP friend sent me here. I am new to this stuff and she has helped me immensely. I am a 34 year old male from Melbourne, Australia. Just want to see if anyone can relate to this and if so feel free to contact me. I need to be able to manage this better. \n\nI have had a rough life. I had to go through school with my younger brother and constantly got told how he is better than me. I never had any friends and was a loner. I was always picked on. I attempted suicide a couple of times because of this. \n\nAfter school I made some horrible decisions. Bad ones in fact that I am ashamed of. I did stuff which I probably haven't forgiven myself for and thus think I am a terrible person despite people saying I am a good person who just made bad decisions. I know I'm a good person, but I can't help but feel I'm a bad person. \n\nThe last couple of years I have been getting over that and working to put myself in a good spot, and I have, but there's a problem. I'm still alone.\n\nOver the years I have had some good friends and we have drifted apart due to location and other things. One thing that has always remained is I am so caring and nice to people. I always want to help people out as much as I can. I am a good listener and want to be here for close friends that they can depend on me for support and advice without judgement or fear. I mostly put people's needs above my own and willing to help anyone. I I hurt someone that wronged me then depending on what it was, I may or may not feel bad about those actions. \n\nI am a confidence person. If I gain confidence I am such a good person to be around. But when I have no confidence I am a mess.\n\nI am in a great job and I am a hard worker. I am a desktop publisher. My previous job I was basically the face of the company. Clients would always come to me instead of my bosses and I would help them out. I would put in so much effort that I never asked for anything or appreciation but I was never appreciated and wanted to be deep down. \n\nPast relationships with girls haven't been good. The types of girls that have been attracted to me used me deeply. I have been cheated on and used and the mother of a previous girlfriend kept telling her that I am not worth it and she can do better than me. So my confidence levels when it has come to that side of things has been shot. Problem is some times I think she was/is right. I will get to that later. \n\nAs I have struggled to maintain friendships I am alone and feel like shit when people don't talk to me. So therefore I come across as so needy. I try to reach out to friends but when they don't respond or want to catch up I feel like I am not special. Therefore I need massive assurance and if I don't get it I struggle. \n\nI am making a lot of good changes in my life but the same thing remains. I am lonely. I am so fucking used to being lonely that I start to think I am going to be this way forever. \n\nI had a major high speed car accident when I was 20 and I walked away unscathed so I know I am here for a reason so that's why I always fight and never give up. I'm so resilient. \n\nI am told I am awesome and such a good guy and that people would be lucky to have me as a friend or boyfriend yet here I am alone and can't hold friendships so I wonder to myself are they just saying that to make me feel better? If it were true then why don't I have people in my life that want to hang with me or understand me. It's because they don't understand me. \n\nThat's where this ENTP friend comes into play. She understands me and wants me to vent if it helps me but I don't want our friendship to become just that. I haven't met anyone that understands me so it's good talking to her but here is a problem. I can't help but feel it's going to be a matter of time until she grows cold of me and ditches me like everyone else has and that's the problem I have when it comes to new friendships. I am a massive overthinker and dwell on the past. I mean her no disrespect and even though I know she understands me I can't help but feel that way you know? She thinks I am great but I can't help but feel she is going to run 100 miles away. I feel a bond with her that I want to keep but am scared. \n\nThat is where confidence comes in. If I can have a good friend and them not abandon me then I will get confidence back that I can have friendships. Likewise a relationship with someone. Despite past shit I am willing to put myself out there again but most girls would get turned off with me. If I was in a relationship with someone and it didn't work out and ended on good terms I would have confidence for the future. \n\nAnyway I can't keep relying on this friend because even though she has helped me a lot I want our friendship to be based on more. I want it to be genuine and we can talk about lots of different stuff, which we have shown we can do as we have a lot in common, but lately it's just been me venting. \n\nThat is why I'm opening myself up here to see if anyone can relate to this and what they did to get over these heightened feelings I have.\n\nNo one has spoken to me in well over 24 hours apart from work colleagues and I am here feeling so crap. I have tried to talk to people but they haven't shown interest. All I need is someone to check in and see how I'm going etc. I don't need a conversation. I just need to be shown appreciation and love every now and then but no one can really provide it. I know they are busy or need time to themselves particularly the latter with this ENTP friend and I told her she can talk to me whenever she wants so I understand that, but I cant help but be fearful maybe she has gone cold when she doesn't and doesn't like me anymore. Basically I am so used to being lonely I can go days without talking to anyone and I feel like I'm going to be lonely the rest of my life. I need to be able to get rid of these feelings of self doubt so I can improve friendships. I need to improve friendships. I'm always looking to improve myself where I can. \n\nDon't get me wrong. I am happy with half of my life. I am just way too much of an overthinker.\n\nSorry for the long post. Just wanted to share my story and see if anyone out there feels the same. We can all benefit from each other. 
3	Seen someone in the past who helped with things which im getting over. Not really seeing anyone now. Will do if i cant find ways to deal with the current situation.
2	I’m sorry to hear that, are you seeing a therapist? It seems like you have a lot of issues from the past, and it might be helpful to talk through it with someone.\nAs for the depression, I can definitely relate. I had some issues with that back in high school. It can be tough to get through, and I ended up seeking professional help for it. Best of luck to you. 
2	Re: ENTP person\nIf she is sticking around, she likes you, ENTPs generally avoid anyone who doesn't stimulate their brains and you although will be tiring her, she will probably appreciate a challenge for her to help solve. It took me a while to learn this when I was dating one. It sounds like she, like most other ENTPs, are much better with advice rather than comforting. They don't need much comforting themselves so they struggle to reciprocate. \nDon't worry too much about trying to move past the venting to her. ENTPs are great talkers and listeners. If she wants to talk, she'll talk, no question.\n\nRe: The rest\nYou've gone through hell my friend. Seriously see a therapist, they help you break down your overthinking into more manageable segments to try deal with. \n\n
1	Fellow ISFJ here. If you're struggling with loneliness you should stop to put yourself into perspective. Remember ... you are naturally inclined to introversion so I think part of the issue is learning to embrace and accept that you are ok and even better off alone. Once you come to accept and enjoy that inner core that makes you you then you are safe to explore friendships. We try to always wait for the perfect time or the perfect event to launch into something and perfect never happens. Hard lesson learned over time. We lack patience.
4	Anyone been in a relationship with our opposites (an ENTP)? How did it work out? Any advice?	
3	Not really but sort of an answer to your question.\n\nI'm currently in a relationship with one of you and I am an ENTP. \n\nThings are going well. The hard part is communicating effectively but both of us straight up admitting that we don't understand how the other communicates and working on getting on the others level is beyond helpful. We find that we really are great since we inhabit the weaknesses of the other one and although we're ineffective working together sometimes we are great when we both take up different parts of a project together as complete it that way. \n\nMy biggest advice on this is learning to communicate. As you said, we're opposites. Many times I want to analyze her and challenge her in verbal debates. When she doesn't take the bait I need to step back and realize it was dumb to set up for one when she's not the kind to do that. The opposite is true with her. She realized that just because I question her on something that I don't actually mean what I say most of the time. I'm really just asking to try and get her to talk out her reasoning so that I can understand where she came to her conclusion from since I know she'll arrive there differently than I will and I want to hear that journey.\n\nWe both love talking to each other and also just love having simple things to do together like hiking, watching Netflix, and doing puzzles or playing video games. Once we get that communication barrier down the sky is the limit for an INFJ/ENTP relationship.\n\n**TL;DR- As an ENTP, my advice to learn to communicate on the others level. We're opposites for a reason and once we bridge the communication gap a world of possibilities exist.**
3	As an ISFJ woman who dated an ENTP male here's what I have to say.\n\nUpon us crossing paths we had a REALLY strong connection. The ENTP loved to talk about EVERYTHING and I was happy to listen. Whenever I had problems, my SO would always give sound advice but struggled to comfort me how I would have liked. I could tell the ENTP was getting bummed out by all my feelings.\n\nAs the others in here have said, communication would be the key here. Oftentimes I've noticed ENTPs to be able to build very strong relationships fast, but then die out quickly. They put on a show that can help them bond stronger with the other, it's still them but...they're putting in a LOT of effort. \n\nThey eventually tire of this and revert to their most natural states. It took me a long time to realise that this wasn't him not liking me anymore, but him being too tired, and felt comfortable enough to just let loose. \n\nIf an ISFJ can tolerate the ENTP when they can't give the you enough attention, things could be a chance. But more than likely the ENTP will not be able to sustain the ISFJs emotional needs.
2	I will copy what I wrote in another post asking something similar. Sorry for recycling, but it's more efficient:\n\nI am an ISFJ female in a long relationship (+7years) with my ENTP SO. I would say it has not been an easy road, although we are young and we have gone through a lot of changes and personal growth while our relationship was developing. We have overcome several issues, mainly related with the way we communicate and express our feelings.\n\nI love ENTPs! I love that they are always able to start an interesting conversation with anyone, their dark witty humor, their ability to think out of the box. But I have also resented my SO for some ENTP traits like: thinking he is always right (relentless debater), underestimate the importance of emotions, being disorganized and messy (it has caused arguments about house chores, etc).\n\nThough I have also been a disastrous and inmature ISFJ in the past and for sure he was resented of me sometimes. I needed a lot of reassurance from his part (messaging frequently, jealousy issues...), my feelings were hurt easily depending on the way he expressed himself, sometimes he felt he could not debate thinks with me because I was doubtful of my own opinions to state them, I usually avoided confrontation and shut down if a lot of pressure is put in me (this one I am still working on haha)...\n\nAnyway, this remains in the past. We have grown and understand each other better, and we  have even "exchanged" some traits that make us a more complete person. My conclusion is that if both people are mature enough and put communication first, this relationship is very enriching for both parts.\n 
1	ENTP is not really your opposite... you guys share the same first four cognitive functions. Actually you guys are not as different as you think.

2	Why have there been so many advertisements about MBTI Discords recently?
6	What do all of you do for work? Are you in a career that is considered a good match for an ISFJ? I’m looking to change jobs and find something a better fit to my personality.	
5	I’m in HR and pretty much love it...mostly.
3	I’m an associate at a telephone crisis counseling line. I’m currently in a battle with the state I moved to to get them to give me my counseling license because they’re confused about the classification of my master’s program, but if I can work it out I’ll be a counselor at my current company. I love it, it’s an excellent fit for the guardian personality and it’s never boring. 
3	I'm a registered nurse...it's challenging but it's the most rewarding and inspiring thing helping others in need
3	I’m an insurance broker and I love it.\n\nIt allows me to be serious sometimes and soak up knowledge and be able to educated people on coverages etc in a quiet, professional atmosphere. \n\nI’m august I started working st a remote office by myself and I am LOVING it 
2	I graduated in veterinary medicine and now I am working in a biomedical research lab after finishing my master degree. My intention is to do a PhD. I don't know if this career is considered a good match for ISFJ, although my memory and organizational skills help a lot. On the other hand, it was very stressful at the beginning, when I felt like a fish out of water. 
2	I've been a nurse for 5 years and I love it!
2	I'm employed as a CNA and am working towards a BSN degree. My job can be challenging but I find it incredibly worthwhile. I love being able to work so closely with people, I believe it syncs well with my empathetic side. I look forward to accomplishing my goal and becoming a nurse. I couldn't imagine myself doing anything else, honestly. 
1	ISFJ and Creativity/ Imagination	I was wondering - how do other ISFJs feel about their creative/ imaginative potential?\n\nI am fairly new to the realisation that I am an ISFJ, and in no way want to "blame" or attribute some of my quality to my type, and obviously we are all individuals. \n\nBut after reading more about ISFJ qualities, I massively connected with the trait of being very practical, traditional, and concerned with "here and now". I don't spend much time daydreaming or imagining  new things or characters, but as someone who really enjoys drawing, music, and all things creative, want to expand my abilities in that area.\n\nHow do you find creativity works as an ISFJ? Anyone out there also struggling with being a bit too practical and struggling to break away from convention? How do you set your imagination free?\n\nAny thoughts, advice and opinions welcome
2	I write and draw in my free time, so I spend a lot of time trying to be creative. I don't know what it is like for others, but I tend to corrupt ideas and build upon them. Like, the core of every story is a seed from a different story and then the consequences that follow. I'll take certain things out and put other things in per my taste. It's like- I hold the new story in my mind and see how the flavor changes when I substitute certain parts for others. I'm not sure if it's what you mean by creative- assembling and modifying parts of other things- but it ends up looking like creativity in the end. \n\n\nTo this end, I might suggest you find something you like and start swapping out elements until you stumble upon something that interests you. For example, seeing a favorite book from a different character's perspective. Changing the genre of that book. What kind of story does it become? The ideas might start burbling up from that neglected, inferior Ne ;)
2	I went to college for fine art and found that in that environment the creativity flowed. But as I’ve gotten older I’ve become more rigid and it’s hard for me to be uniquely creative. I love and enjoy art and music, but creating my own is very difficult now.
1	You are creative when it comes to the here and now and practical tasks. 
2	Any fellow musicians/music lovers on here?	1. What kind of music do you play/like?\n2. Instrument(s)?\n3. How long have you been playing?\n4. Play in any bands?\n5. Do you write original music?\n6. How does mbti fit into your music?\n\nI’ll start!\n\n1. I like folk rock, rock, punk, bluegrass (not so much traditional), pop punk, folk, jazz fusion, funk, and blues based rock.  I’m not a fan of pop or country (I mainly just don’t like modern country, but I like Americana).  A few favorite bands include The Beatles, Ben Folds, Los Lonely Boys, Red Hot Chili Peppers, allman brothers, the band, Derek trucks, bob Dylan, Blake mills, blue rodeo, the bros. Landreth, Chatham county line, Dawes, Dave Rawlings, Elvis Costello, Elliot smith, fall out boy (their old stuff), Bayside, Four year strong, the hush sound, Jason isbell, I fight dragons, motion city soundtrack, the Jayhawks, nickel creek, Relient K, ry cooder, Ryan Adams, the shins, slaid cleaves, son volt, the wallflowers, and Wilco.\n\n2. I mainly play the guitar. I can play the piano, drums, piano, and mandolin as well, but guitar is my best instrument\n\n3. Been playing guitar since I was 12 (I’m 20 now). \nOther instruments I started later - all of them I started probably between the ages of 13 and 15. \n\n4. I play in a cover band with a few friends - we play mainly more popular stuff just to make some extra money.  \nI also play guitar for a family band. We write originals, but my brother and cousin have written all the songs that we play.\n\n5. I do like to write music. I’ve written probably 12 songs that I’ve never showed to anyone. I’m mainly trying to improve my songwriting abilities. I’m trying to get better at writing lyrics mainly. I’ll eventually show some songs to my band so we can play them, but I’m waiting until my songs are good enough .\n\n6. As an isfj, performances make me nervous. But after doing it for a while, I definitely don’t get as nervous as I used to. Could be my introverted sensing - as I perform more and more I get more and more used to being on stage and don’t get as phased by it.  Writing lyrics is hard for me, which could go back to the fact that Ne is inferior - ideas don’t come to me very easily or often and I’m not good with metaphors or other literary devices.  I do think, however, that Fe improves my ability to write good music - it allows me to experience the melody and harmony emotionally and write pieces that have the power to move others.  
2	1. I like metal/prog and punk rock. Some bands include Paramore, \n    Yellowcard, Breaking Benjamin, Disturbed, Pantera, Black \n    Sabbath, Royal Blood, Animals as Leaders, Saosin etc. . But I \n    also love the 80s, artists include Prince, Simply Red, Toto, Sting, \n    Richard Marx, Collin Raye etc.\n \n2. I play percussive instruments, with my favourite being the cajon. \n    Well it's mainly because I play it in church and it is so versatile.\n \n3. I've been playing with my hands since 5, playing on instruments \n    since 13.\n\n4. I play for church, if that counts :)\n\n5. No.\n\n6. I enjoy being really skilled at it. It also gives me great \n    satisfaction to bring the music up a notch. I also like considering \n    certain details when I play such as playing with greater velocity, \n    changing up patterns and so on
7	How do my fellow ISFJ's deal with break-up?	I am not a casual dater and I have recently lost a very important relationship to me that I thought would last a lifetime. Please feel free to send me your advice on dealing with yourself post-breakup.\n\nHow long does it take to feel "okay" again? 
5	I read your posts and your ex displays signs of a personality disorder. Borderline/ narcissist. At the very least, he is a controlling, manipulative, and abusive person.\n\nI am sorry that you are hurting, but I want to encourage you and tell you that you are FREE. Life only goes up from here!\n\nI suggest you check out /r/exnocontact and /r/bpdlovedones to see if anything resonates with you. He might or might not have a disorder, but many people on these two subs have had to walk out from abusive relationships. It is a good place to commiserate and find ways to move on.\n\nMy advice? Find yourself again. Do not lose your personal identity. Spend time with yourself, find out what your boundaries are. Surround yourself with people who actually respect you and treat you well. Once you find yourself walking on eggshells and playing the push-pull, **walk away.**\n\nYou are lucky he left you, and left you fast. I know this is not what you want to hear, but you deserve better. You do.
4	    Please feel free to send me your advice on dealing with yourself post-breakup\n\nTurn the page, move on, destroy/remove everything you own from your ex partner, at least that how I did before. I have difficulties living in the past because usually the past sucks.\n\nYou have to go forward.\n\n    How long does it take to feel "okay" again?\n\nProbably never entirely, but if you follow my advice above, usually it's quite fast.\n\nSome of my exes think I'm heartless for forgetting all about it "so quickly" but it's what's most effective for me.
3	Tomorrow will be 8 months no contact for me. I feel much better at 7 months mark. I keep repeating to myself that he doesn't feel the same way that I do. It takes two to tango. No matter how strong I feel, if the other person doesn't feel the same way, then it will not work. Even though I think the relationship will work through growth, compromise, and miraculous things we can do in my perfect mind, in reality he chose to end it and I have to accept his decision. Make a list of why the relationship didn't work and what you don't like about the relationship. Keep the list and when you want to contact him, read it. I still miss my ex, but the pain and sadness are finite and last only a while.  
3	In my experience, it goes in phases. It takes me a couple days to be "fine," but then overall several months to be "okay," probably up to a year to be "good." I am good at dealing with things right away, getting back into hanging out with friends, going to work, distracting myself. However, there tends to be a pendulum that swings me back from okayness to sadness for a while. Just keep on doing what you do and try to remember that you are strong enough to get through it.
2	I'm still dealing with the lingering effects of a somewhat traumatic friend-breakup that was similar in the sense that I really did think we would be together forever, but I guess I can tell you what I now think I should have done? \n\nBasically, I think I should have let myself grieve more. It's something I'm very bad at doing, as I hate crying, feeling irrational, feeling like I'm bothering others, etc. I never really let myself feel sad about it after that first night, but I definitely should have instead of forcing myself straight through to anger. I felt like I needed the anger to propel myself away from the relationship and keep myself from wallowing or giving into the urge to reach out, and in that regard it definitely worked! But even two years later I haven't been able to fully let go of my feelings and free myself from the trauma of the relationship ending so suddenly and horribly. I think if I had given myself more than one night to cry and wonder and regret, maybe I would be more fully over it by now. Or maybe not, it's hard to say. \n\nSo I guess my advice would be, definitely don't try to get back in contact, avoid checking on their social media (that's a great way to make yourself feel like shit), but do take as much time as you need to mourn. Try not to let it consume you, keep your day-to-day life moving as much as possible, but reach out to people in your life who you feel like you can confide in and don't be afraid to talk about it with them. And remember that this breakup, as much as it may hurt, can be a form of self-care. You can take this as an opportunity to make sure you're giving yourself back the love you were putting into the relationship, and to appreciate the love you get from your friends/family/etc. \n\nAnyway, I'm really sorry you're going through this and I hope you're okay soon 💕
2	ISFJ Male. Hey, yeah... I don't know of anything that sucks more for our type. I'll try to weed out the practices that adversely affected me and only give you the helpful ones. You can PM me if you want to hear the bad ones to avoid.\n\nFeeling "okay" again? It's been different for me, once it took about 6 months, a couple other times it took over 5 years. I know... probably not what you want to go through.\n\n* Give yourself time to grieve. Not just after the event, regularly. If you need to be alone, cut everything off and take the time to process for a while. Even if you don't make progress, at least you are letting go of pressure that would otherwise build until released on someone.\n* Talk with friends about all the feels and that person. This exercises your Fe in a healthy way and gives a outlet to the inevitable stress these other practices are going to incur.\n* Take the painful step of destroying everything that you have kept of that person. I know, I KNOW that isn't what you want to do. DO THE THING. Texts, photos, letters, connected objects... everything you can.\n* Disassociate memories. Yeah, this one is even harder. Sometimes all I want to do is remember how someone loved me in a particular way and just stay there for a few minutes (ends up being more than a few). Do your best to remember that is gone now and something similar might be found in another living person. Possibly something better... believe me, that is possible. I found it when I didn't think it existed.\n* Pray. Seriously, prayer and meditation can do WONDERS.\n\n\n* This last one is something new I am trying and I'm not sure the data is conclusive yet: Activating shadow functions during pain. We use Si-Fe-Ti-Ne right? Activating Se and Te seem to help me somewhat, at least temporarily. Se as in blaring favorite music, cooking a NICE meal, having a scotch or glass of wine (never more than 1, it's NOT healthy to do more when in pain... if you don't have the discipline for this yet, just skip that one), or going shooting/martial arts. Te activity in anything that forces me to think rapidly and not over think any particular aspect. Debating a topic, reading a book without pausing to consider like normal, and some types of video game. Keep in mind these kinds of activities will drain you... for the moment, they seem to help when used as a "bandaid" to keep me functioning normally. If you notice self destructive behavior, cut that off like a cancer.\n\nHope I could help, sorry for your pain dear.
4	How are isfj's with keeping in contact?	Well, long story short I had an isfj coworker, at least I'm pretty sure he was an isfj. Admittedly we didn't work together very long but when we did we bonded extremely well before he was transferred.We had all of the same interests and would talk for hours sometimes. Also, he was constantly joking around with me, going out of his way to approach and mess with me, literally every possible opportunity. Well, a problem happened at my work after he left and I texted him for the first time asking for his opinion on the issue. His response was very brief and curt so I assumed that I had crossed over a line since we didn't work together long and didn't text him again. \n\n Well, he came back to my workplace to get his last paycheck and went looking for me to talk. When he tracked me down, he was super friendly, asking me if everything was ok, and encouraging me to text if any other issues came up, saying he wanted to know and that I wasn't going to bother him. After he left the building he also sent a text reassuring that I wasn't bother him and to let him know if any other issues came up. So weeks later I texted, updating him on the situation which had gotten worse and asked him how his new job was going. He basically only responded to how his job was going in one short curt sentence and didn't respond to my situation at all. That was about two months ago. Idk.. I know he didn't have any obligation to respond to me at all but it seems weird because he was encouraging me to keep contacting him then his responses almost seem like he's annoyed when I do. I've seen other threads on different sites about how isfj's are bad with keeping contact with people but I don't know if that was true and just thought I would get this subreddit's opinion. Thanks. 
16	I’m good at keeping in contact with people who are part of my daily routine - family, current coworkers, close friends - but absolutely horrible with keeping up with people I don’t see regularly. It doesn’t mean I don’t care about them, but it gives me a lot of anxiety to reach out to someone I haven’t seen in a while. 
6	I am absolutely awful with keeping in contact with people. I will go several hours without checking my phone.\n\nNow, that's not to say that's the reason your former co-worker is being short with you. Some people are just really bad at texting and others just forget about people quickly.\n\nMaybe text him again in the future and decide if you are still interested in talking to him?
3	I'm really bad at keeping in contact with most people, especially via text.... there are a few people I'm very close to who are exceptions, but generally speaking, even if I like someone, I don't want them to text me. That sounds bad, but it gives me anxiety and I'm bad at keeping a conversation going (plus half the time I just straight up check the text, close the app to think about my response, and then forget to ever answer because the notification is gone), so old friends/acquaintances texting me out of nowhere gives me huge anxiety. If they're not someone who I click with on a level where I wanna be texting them every day, my anxiety wants me to just forget they exist so I can forget the shame and guilt of not being able to start/keep up a conversation like a normal human being lol.\n\nAside from all of that though, it also just sounds like he might not be a great texter?? Some people totally forget or just don't understand that tone comes across very differently via text than in person, so they can accidentally seem really harsh or rude. It's hard to say, but if he deliberately sought you out in person then I doubt he dislikes you at all. 
2	Personally I'm terrible at keeping in contact with people unless they are extremely dear to my heart, like my S.O. or my best friend.
1	I am abysmal at it
1	> I've seen other threads on different sites about how isfj's are bad with keeping contact with people but I don't know if that was true\n\n100% true for me. Even when I want to, I feel like I just *can’t*
1	We mean well but we get caught up in current life and it will stay in the back of our minds as a quiet reminder to reach out as you said you would. Almost never happens. My true friends will make plans with me then just bail at the last minute. My friends are introverts.
6	Advice for ENTP (male) with crush on ISFJ (female) coworker	Hi lovely ISFJs, \n\nAfter a lot of time observing and interacting with my workplace crush, I've realized she is not an INFJ as I had originally thought, but rather a very thoughtful and warm-hearted ISFJ. Therefore I have two big questions I'd like any help with.\n1) I've heard plenty about ENTP-INFJ magic compatibility, however ENTP-ISFJ is not talked about as much. I personally believe that there is a lot of room for each side of this pairing to benefit, given the huge differences in personality, but I can also see the struggles. What do ISFJs think of ENTPs? \n2) I'd love to know if any of these behaviors I've noticed about how she interacts with me are telling of a possible crush on her end as well: \n\n-will laugh very loudly at almost every joke I make, especially if we are alone, but even when we are in groups\n-seemingly treats me differently in solo interactions (more attentive, open when I ask questions, willing to engage with my silliness) than group conversations (checking her phone, giving brief unrevealing answers, trying to play it more cool towards me)  \n-Almost always eats lunch with me. If more people are in the lunch group, she will often stick it out until others leave and stay and keep talking to me for another 10-15 minutes. \n-She always joins to go out to a restaurant or bar after work with me and other coworkers. But as far as I can tell, she never elects to drink at these outings even if she does drink with other friends (afraid of showing feelings?) \n-beginning to tell me more private things out of the blue that she doesn't tell other members of our work friend group. This is still very rare, but it does happen (talking about things she doesn't like about her job, or gripes about co-workers/friends outside of work) \n-She very rarely initiates conversations in person and though she responds if I IM her, she doesn't typically engage in drawn out conversations with me that way  \n-There aren't a lot of other young males in the office and of the other young males, but I am the only one I have ever seen her engage with socially, in a non professional manner \n\nI have other examples I could give if needed. I'm still trying to figure her out and am willing to wait until she is more comfortable with me, if needed, as she really is one of the most caring, conscientious and quietly clever people I've ever met and I think that's exactly all an ENTP guy could ask for. 
5	(sorry for my english as it's not my native language) \nI am an ISFJ female in a long relationship (+7years) with my ENTP SO. I would say it has not been an easy road, although we are young and we have gone through a lot of changes and personal growth while our relationship was developing.

I needed a lot of reassurance from his part (messaging frequently, jealousy issues...), my feelings were hurt easily depending on the way he expressed himself, sometimes he felt he could not debate thinks with me because I was doubtful of my own opinions to state them, I usually avoided confrontation and shut down if a lot of pressure is put in me (this one I am still working on haha)...\n\nAnyway, this remains in the past. We have grown and understand each other better, and we  have even "exchanged" some traits that make us a more complete person. My conclusion is that if both people are mature enough and put communication first, this relationship is very enriching for both parts.\n\nNow, point 2) I speak from personal experience and don't want to cause an impulsive reaction from your part haha. But from what you say, I would think she is interested. She looks actively to spend time with you, express herself more easily, even with intimate subjects, laughs at all your jokes... Does she have some details through the day with you specifically? Like bringing or sharing food with you, small presents, doing you favors that would ease your day...? At least, these are things I would do for someone I am interested. Also sometimes, I repress my desire to message or engage in a conversation to not be a burden or, if I suspect that feelings are not corresponded, to avoid being obvious about mine.\n\nHope it helps. I wish you luck with your crush and it's very nice you inform yourself about her mbti type. But also, have in mind that everyone is different and I would take my opinion with a pinch of salt! 
2	How much is ur relationship like Pam and Jim in The office? \n\n
1	ENTP here but I would say she is interested in you for sure. ISFJs follow proper procedure for stuff like this. Obviously every one of them is different, but I think they are best defined by the slow, steady grind they apply to almost everything, including relationship. \n\nINFJ as you probably can imagine are like, radically different from this. They squish time into their own perceptions of it, imagine the future, take the relationship to the end, see both your deaths, and bail before the relationships starts. \n\nISFJ and ENTP have a big thing going for them: When both people purse health and development, the relationship will see growth too. You grow toward each other. But if either or both don't trust each other, the types of mistakes that each other will make will be obviously quite threatening to the other. \n\nISFJ is a great match for ENTP though. It's best if they come to understand ENTP for sure. Look up the Socionics "Dual" relationship, which is a slightly optimistic take on the relationship between people who swap each others Dominant, auxiliary, inferior, and tertiary functions. ISFJ and ENTP are each other's best fit by this metric. But I do believe that the trouble in the relationship most often comes from the ISFJ not really believing that the ENTP is so different from them. ENTP can come to grips with the reality of the ISFJ easier than the ISFJ can come to grips with the ENTP, IMO. It's like, the ENTP is so much broader than they appear; contains all the dark and the light; the ISFJ is so much more condensed.\n\nI think in the best version of the relationship, the two learn to high value one another's strengths, Dominant and Auxiliary functions. \n\nThis could be helped by steering your friendship toward NOT doing your tertiary as much with her. Try when alone doing LESS Fe and more Ti. Let her notice you are different toward her, and tell her some day that when you get comfortable with people you become more authentically you, which looks like introverted thinking, less funny guy. Notice how she is doing the analogous thing already for you; she's doing LESS Ti when alone with you; she's doing more Fe when alone with you. This is a vulnerable state for an introverted sensor like her; she's basically stretching her toe across a line and reaching out. It's far more comfortable for her to stay in a Si/Ti loop. \n\nRemember isfj feels attracted to using Ti and being complimented for it but it's better for her if she leans into Fe. It will be incredibly refreshing to her some day for you to let her know that what you love about her is the Fe, that this looks magic to you. Eventually you can start shoving her off Ti when you see her doing it, and she can shove you off Fe when she sees you do it (which will build a relationship where you lie a lot less and she obsesses a lot less).\n\nMy ISFJ cousin and I became very close, having a bottle of Wine and talking business every night, or say three nights a week, for like a year. He then cut me off out of concern I might be a psychopath after some stuff went down at work that he didn't understand. I didn't know for 18 months he was feeling down on me; I just figured we grew apart. He called me up and asked if we could set up some time to talk through it; he said he had feelings he wanted to acknowledge, that he was operating on a lot of assumptions he suspected were wrong about me, and that he simultaneously needed to acknowledge a way I make him feel when we interact, which was: Diminished. I think I totally understand where he is coming from, because back then I thought he was an INTP or ENTP. He's in his 40s, highly skilled, Ivy League student of philosophy, amateur comedian, and I've always perceived him as the most intelligent friend I have. \n\nAND YET thanks to having done so much MBTI in the past 2 years while he and I were on the outs, I recognized that what is so brilliant about him his is astounding Fe capacity combined with this Slow Steady Grind ability he has (dom Si). Man. It's brilliant. The way this guy learns engineering for example: start on page one, move through to the end. Keep track on a board of how many hours for motivation. Just hundreds of hours, 12 hours a day for a year, and now he programs applications. That kinda thing. \n\nIn our little makeup convo, I only had to tell him one thing to help him understand I wasn't a psychopath—I just had to explain how I had perceived a thing that went down at work, and why I took the action I did, which, whether the action worked out the way any of us wanted, was not psychopathic. Awkwardly enough it was protective of him, which became obvious to him rather quickly when we discussed. It appeared to him it had resulted in his loss of work, and mine. In fact, his loss of work was already enacted; my behavior only added the loss of MY job to the mix, in an effort to save his. It literally doesn't bother me that it was unclear to him what I had been doing; I'm uncomfortable with the idea that I acted just to save a friend. That feels unethical. haha. Fe ethics, dammit, so beholden to a power structure that I feel out of place using Fi stuff to be like "Mine and my people's shit matters more here than the corporate rule." Fe tows the line of the higher power structure; I used Fi to try to save him and my Fi is uncalibrated so I probably acted unethically I realize now. \n\nAT ANY RATE \n\nThis illustrates some of what I mean when I say the ISFJ may misunderstand the ENTP. But ISFJ really can be a thrilling conversation partner, best I've ever met. They just need to know it's okay to tell you to STFU, to say "I am exhausted by our conversation, It's time to be done," to say "I need to go eat now" or whatever. \n\nBut the most valuable thing that happened with my cousin was when he told me he felt diminished, I was able to hear him out totally, and he realized that I love hearing critical takes on me; I love being Seen by a person who sees clearly; so then I was able to tell him that I find him incredibly brilliant, and because he's a decade older than me perhaps, I never used to take the energy to worry about the possibility of like, diminishing him, and I'm sorry for being so reckless. I told him that I understand us better now, as I used to think we were the same, and he was smarter; now I understand we are sort of complimentary opposites, with totally unique sorts of intelligence, and I would in the future remind him all the time that he needs to cut me off when I cut him off, put his hand in the air to signal that I can't interrupt him, train me a bit in this way, realize that I do in fact know that it can wait, I just forget; once he understands more about Ne, he can help me build a system for our relationship, like "Let's talk for this many hours, and you need your pen and paper for notes so you don't interrupt me as much." Etc. 
14	Any of you struggles to become more assertive?	I find quite difficult changing this trait of my personality.
4	I'm an ENTP/ENTJ and with assertiveness, I would say it just takes practice if it doesn't come naturally to you. You just have to know that you're right and accept the fact that even if you're wrong its okay because everyone is wrong at some point and everyone makes mistakes at least once in their lifetimes. 
3	I had the same issue. But with a mom who's an ESTJ and also a boss at work who is also an ESTJ, they've taught me to stand my ground on a lot of things if I know I'm right, even if it causes a discord or argument. I usually walk away from arguments because I can't be bothered over stupid things. But these ESTJ people know what they're talking about and the same goes for ISTJ (my sister). I take a lot of my braveness from those two types. \n\nAs has been said above, it takes a hell of a lot of practice, and might I add, a lot of heartbreaks (on my part) to become more assertive.
3	I’m super assertive on my birthday. Only day where people have to do what I want and I don’t feel guilty about it. 
2	I was assertive ONCE, and it backfired so badly that I’ve never tried to be assertive again.
1	For those that have practiced how to be more assertive, what were some things that helped you? 
18	Friendships	Hello,\nI have always had a hard time connecting deeply with others. I always just thought it was me until I recently did the personality test and found this community. I'm blown away by how similarly I feel.\nBasically, I'm very nice and friendly with everyone and will go out of my way to make sure everyone around me is comfortable, while I feel out of place myself. But you would never know it by seeing me. \nI find it practically impossible to open up to others and have been feeling increasingly more lonely as what I need is a deep bond to feel connected. I will always help and take care of others as much as I can but don't feel comfortable enough to be open with others with how I am. All my friendships are basically just "surface", very rarely have I felt close enough with someone to consider them a true friend, and that doesn't always last, I put in the effort but need to feel it reciprocated. \nI feel alone in large groups and can get easily overrun by others, mostly I stay silent unless I'm spoken to. In smaller groups, it's easier but I still have a very hard time being comfortable.\nAnyway that's about it! I just wanted to introduce myself and see if anyone feels the same way or would want to talk :) \n\nHave a wonderful night!\n\n
6	Especially the speak when spoken to part. I was basically a mute all through highschool.
5	I relate to this so much.
2	I rarely feel comfortable and have an extremely small group of people whom I would call friends. Not sure how to fix the getting comfortable part enough to the point of making friends though...
2	Making new friends is very exhausting to me. \nIn the past I had many one-sided "surface" friendships and the older I got, the more selective I became in the people I befriended, because non-reciprocal "small talk" relationships cost me too much energy (and frustration).. Whenever I meet someone and it doesn't go smooth from the beginning, I realize I'm better off alone (with my boyfriend), eventually. I relate to the other stuff, too. * THE INTROVERT LIFE *
1	Hm, posts like these make me question whether I'm ESFJ or ISFJ. For me, I find it relatively easy to open up to others and consider many to be friends. Despite all of that, I feel like I don't belong sometimes as well, which is probably why I'm perceived as really quiet when first meeting me. 
1	I find that my deep bonds with friends have been formed over years of friendship and ups and downs, my two best friends I've known since I was 13 and I can honestly say I feel the deepest connection with them, their types are INTJ and INTP. The INTJ hates being around people for extended periods of time and the other day we were hanging out, she stayed over for about 8 hours and we were just enjoying each other's company which we hadn't done in a while, she said I'm one of the only people she doesn't feel exhausted around and I think that just comes from how long we've been friends.\n\nI also find it easier to feel connected with people when it's one on one as opposed to groups so if you're struggling in a room full of people, work on pulling someone away from the main conversation and having your own with them on the side.
1	I️ feel this post so much. WE RELATE. ❤️
1	Yeah I totally get you on the need for reciprocity. Honestly kind of giving up on finding it. It shouldn’t matter though at the end of the day I feel like as long as you keep true to who you are then it was worth it in the end. \n\nLike you I tend to avoid large groups and feel like I can only ever open up in a 1 on 1 situation with a very select individual. I always feel like they do fall flat, but I haven’t quite given up on the search for a true friend, yet.
5	Seeking advise for dating an ISFJ guy.	I'm totally smitten by an ISFJ guy but he's not talkative and doesn't open up much. I asked him to say something interesting about his l him and he replied "I like coffee" 😑😂. My insecure self is worrying that he is no longer interested in me and that he probably finds me boring. Need help on how to get close to him. An INFP guy here. 
17	I mean... putting him on the spot like that probably isn't a good idea. If you asked me that I probably would've said something dumb too, and felt pretty weird and insecure about it, to boot. I'm not 100% sure if this is common in ISFJs, but for me at least, I need to have some nominal level of trust with someone before I open up to them, and a "tell me something interesting about yourself"-level relationship just ain't gonna cut it. \n\nJust have regular conversation! Ask him if he has any hobbies, what he's doing this weekend, what TV shows he likes, that kinda thing. And talk to him about what you're into, too! Being interested in other people is a great way to get on their good side, but it can seem weirdly one-sided if you only ever ask questions and don't offer up info about yourself in return. See if you can find some common ground to start a more in-depth conversation on. \n\nBut generally, I don't think ISFJs are the type to have a natural answer to a question as broad and subjective as "what's interesting about you?" Our self-esteem isn't usually all that great, for one thing, and our Fe I think tends to make us worry about offering up the "correct" answer so much that leaving something that open-ended can stress us out and kinda shut our brains down. Or at least, that's how it usually goes for me. 
6	Do any of you constantly keep to-do lists?	To-do lists have essentially ruined my life. I would keep a normal to-do list, sure, and I use Habitica to keep track of things I want/need to do daily (because I'm bad at self-care), but then I have this list of habits on the side that I try to do every single day. It's taxing. Sometimes I make a second to-do list and then get stressed out because I'm trying to comprehend both of them. I would do this on a larger scale, with planning out my month, so much so to the point where it caused me anxiety and I had to get counseling for it. I'm tired of being tied down by my to-do lists, they're nice but when I'm constantly on a schedule and am constantly checking things off it's exhausting. Yet if I don't write them down and do them I feel like I'll forget things or never finish them.\n\nDoes anyone else have this hyper-organization problem? Any tips on how to deal with it? Today I'm trying not to look at my lists outside of necessary to-dos and then trying to remember what I want to do. 
5	The most effective technique I have discovered is to have a top priority to-do list with no more than 5 items on it. \n\nJust move the 5 most important items off of your other to-do lists onto the top priority list and knock those out first. When you finish one, moving something else on there. This will prevent you from being overwhelmed and let you focus!\n\nOn the topic of organization: if you need a way to keep all of your lists and everyday notes organized and in one place, I highly recommend Evernote. It syncs between all of your devices and lets you save all sorts of information (text notes, lists, pictures, business cards, Word documents, etc). And it's free!
3	You should look into the Bullet Journal system! \nhttps://youtu.be/hKbzcjJLRRo
2	[This picture can show that maybe my life is TOO organized sometimes](https://i.imgur.com/gjUeU5A.png)\n\nSome technically aren't "To do" things but I keep track of lots of things there regardless.
5	Male INFP here with a few questions :)	Heya! First off I just wanted to say that I find you ISFJs really endearing and pretty cute. I was a sad, lonely and boring person (typical lol) until I met an ISFJ and my world has been a lot brighter ever since. There’s this one ISFJ girl who has helped me through some real rough times and really opened up to me that I’ve inevitably started catching feelings for. I’m just willing to make her as happy as she’s made me. :))\n\n1) Needing ideas for a present. Nothing too fancy but I am a bit of a hopeless romantic (unsurprisingly) so anything that might make your hearts race really. We’re already pretty close if that helps.\n\n2) Are there any traits in an INFP that impress you lot and that I should show more often? Any areas I could potentially improve on? Dos and don’ts?\n\n3) In the chance that I’m seen as nothing more than a friend, will it be ever be possible to change that view? I know it’s case by case but do ISFJs tend to keep an open mind and be willing to give another shot or would moving on be better?\n\nJust asking for uh, a friend.. Seriously though, whatever happens, good or bad, I still really appreciate you lot very much!! <3
2	Being INFP is pretty rare, man. As an ISFJ Male, I can say that don't get too caught up in your daydreaming! Other than that, you should be just fine. Because I personally enjoy INFPs as people anyway. In fact, my father is an ENFP. He can be a handful for sure. 
2	Isfj woman here. I adore INFPs, including their day dreaming. (Then again, 80% of my close friends are intuitive types.) Please take everything I say as a  personal opinion rather than an educated analysis of isfjs. \n\n1. Something personal and thoughtful! Something she's mentioned before or possibly that you worked hard to make/ get. One of my favorite gifts ever was from an infp english major who wrote me a poem about myself. (1) An ST once noticed my phone was always running out of energy and got me a battery pack, and it was a great feeling to know they were thinking about me :) \n\n2.  What I love most about infps is how open they are in discussing each other's ideas, pasts, and personalities. I guess the only advice I can give is to be authentic, but in touchy topics aware of how your words might affect her feelings. \n\n3. I don't know about other isfjs. I know I've personally warmed up to people and also given people chances. However, I know for sure when something isn't going to work out, and it would take a lot to sway me after that. \n\n\nEdit: (1) Not recommended if too forward or you aren't comfortable with writing poetry.

1	I'll admit, im a bit more timid and/or meek then what they seem to say I "should" be but this is fairly spot on. 
1	Hmm, I wish there was an entry for the Capricorn ISFJ - that would be my hubby
12	Meeting other ISFJ's and realisations	Two people I know are ISFJ's, one is my best friends boyfriend, the other is my sisters fiance. I found it funny that these two people I'm close to have ended up with SO's of the same personality type to me but that's besides the point. When I talk to the guys, it feels like I completely understand them to the point where I don't even need to talk to them because I know what they're feeling and how much they probably don't want the attention on them in that moment, and little things like that. I'm so perceptive of other people's comfort levels but nobody can ever tell what I'm thinking and suddenly I've met these people where if they caught on to how similar we were they'd know exactly what was going through my mind and that's kind of unsettling. \n\nOn a slightly unrelated note, I also know I would work terribly with someone of the same personality type to me if I were in a relationship. I bounce off of people's outward personalities, and quirky qualities that are different to my own. I've only realised that since meeting people of the same type to me, not sure if anyone else has had that experience?
2	What's your personality type?
2	How are you traditionalists in a society that's wronged you?	I've been planning a story for a couple of years and there is this character who for fun I tested for his MBTI recently. He has come out as isfj. From descriptions he does seem like he is like you guys, although he does want to change a lot of things in his life, and society in general. That's kind of his whole character, but the reason for doing so is because in all his past experiences in life he feels the system he is living in is wrong. (The reason I want to know is because it'll give me a more complete sense of who he is, although I won't change him to fit a certain type. That'll take the fun out of it. I'm an INFP btw) \n\nReally briefly explaining him, he is wronged by a lot of high ranking people as a child because of the system of his society. He also has a medical issue. When he is older he feels that he can't fix the things that are wrong with him and society until he is told to fix his medical condition he has to change the society he is living in. And therefore thinks he can kill two birds with one stone. Now he meets more people and sticks to a plan that was forged with help from other people to fix society. He is personally and emotionally tested to follow through with his plan but he does so by the end. However he is always struggling with either sticking to his plan and staying away from his family. One side he doesn't want his family to be hurt like they have been in the past and on the other he wants to stay close to his family because of his immense love and need for them emotionally.\n\nThis is the basic character and his decisions and reasons. Do you guys relate to this and is there anything striking that makes him completely non isfj? Main thing that confused me is how you guys seem to be traditionalist which I don't think fit my character in the common term.
6	I'm not really a traditionalist at all. I hang on to things that make me feel good sometimes, certainly; Christmas will always be my favorite holiday because it brings back good memories of times with my family, and I still love the Christmas traditions we do have, but I don't reject the fact that they've changed over the years. I like eating the same few things over and over again when I eat out, and new places and people make me nervous, but I also absolutely put my own comfort above any definition of what I "should" be. I'm a pierced, buzzcutted, butch-leaning lesbian, so I didn't have much chance of being traditional in the first place, I guess. \n\nBut from a larger, more philosophical perspective, I feel like my Fe is a far more driving force than my Si. I see systems in place that hurt people and take advantage of them, and it infuriates me. I absolutely *don't* think that we should hold on to old ways that don't work because "that's how we've always done it." If it's hurting people, if it's inefficient, if it's just stopped fitting the situation, scrap it and start over. There's a value to history, but circumstances and needs change, and systems and traditions should change with them. \n\nSo, yeah, your character sounds reasonable as an ISFJ to me. The struggle between being with his family and keeping them safe would be very difficult as an ISFJ, but that can make it compelling. And if he feels strongly enough that something is so wrong that it's worth breaking the peace over, then I think it's totally reasonable for an ISFJ to do anything he has to in order to make things right. There are probably ISFJs who would react differently, but that doesn't make your character *not* ISFJ, since we're all at different levels of personal development and mental health and whatnot. 
2	I am an ISFJ through and through, but I don't identify with being traditional. There's some factors throughout my life which have made me this way such as a lack of a functioning traditional childhood, so I feel I steered my own way and have my own personal traditions and rituals. These are based on what are most important to me. \n\nAlso, each of the traits is graded on a percentage and I typically have high feeling and thinking percentages. (Feeling always being more though) Although I identify in no way to being an ISTJ, but it might impact my decision making. So this could be true for your character. \n\nHope this helps a bit! 
3	Help please	Before I go to far I firstly want to apologise for any spelling mistakes and grammar mistakes. I'm dyslexic lol (true) \nI'm an ESFJ and my sister in-law is an ISFJ. I care about her and just want to get along, but alas I have upset her and would like to patch things up as it's gotten out of hand.\nLast weekend I had my daughter's birthday party at which we had an issue. It was time to do the Birthday song and cutting of the cake. I had spent over a week putting it together and the topper on the cake had already fallen and broke in which my husband patched up and fixed it to his best ability.\nWe had a plastic table cloth on the table a the little ones ranging from ages 1-4 were pulling at in and everything including the cake was sliding everywhere. So my sister in-law piped up and said why don't we just take the table cloth off. Which I happily agreed should be done and was grateful she wanted to help. At the stage she was crouched down holding her son, I was now standing hands full with an unstable Birthday cake in my hands. She from her crouched position couldn't see a thing past me and began to pull the table cloth off. On the other side of me was all my daughters gifts big boxes etc. They were all coming in my direction. I was trapped between boxes of stuff coming my way, a cake in my hands and my sister in-law crouched down holding her kid in one hand and grabbing at the table cloth in the other. I was trapped and couldn't do a thing. In a panic I asked her to stop. She kept pulling so I raised my voice in urgency to stop again which she did. Everything got fixed up boxes taken off and went on with the Birthday song and cutting of the cake. I thought nothing much of it until my husband had talked to his brother and he said she wasn't happy with how she was treated. So now what do I do as this weekend my nephew had his birthday party this weekend and we didn't get invited and got to see all the photos up on fb. For me I'm just upset my child got excluded from her cousin birthday over this. I'm sure this couldn't have just been the only thing I've upset her with, but I've never gone out of my way to upset anyone on purpose let alone her. I don't want to make things worse I just want to make things better mostly for the kids sake. Please any advice would be nice. Thanks in advance. 
4	From what you said, the only thing that could've felt like she was treated badly was thinking she was getting yelled at when you raised your voice. Did you explain that you weren't yelling at her but raised your voice in a panic because of the situation?
3	Just talk to her and explain why you used that tone of voice. Say that she did nothing wrong. You appreciate her help. She didn’t hear you the first time and you were trying to communicate urgently. 
1	Not at the time. My husband explained it to his brother and who knows if he relayed it to her or not. But I did say that I had everything coming my way and to stop pulling.
1	I guess another question I'm asking is how do I stop her from excluding other innocent parties such as her nice (my daughter) from important things as Birthdays if she is upset with me?
1	Most ISFJs will grudgingly accept an apology or explanation but we also like to be very clear about what our role was in this debacle. I always give others another chance but my heart does not always agree.
10	isfjs studying psychology?	I was wondering if there are any isfjs here studying psychology/in a psychology-related job? Currently I’m considering an undergrad course in psych and was wondering how you feel about studying psych, whether you enjoy your job etc. \n\nI enjoy understanding human interactions. It could be an isfj thing, but I’m constantly analysing how people react and behave, whether it’s subconscious or not. \n\nOne thing I’m concerned about is whether such a course would be too “conceptual” & “abstract” for sensors like me? I understand that MBTI should not dictate your career choices, but I like to be cautious and I do want to hear more opinions before I make an important decision :”) 
6	Go for it, it's even too abstract for me.\n\nYou trust too much your own identity, when you just need to give it a try. Especially if you have affinity with the subject.\n\nThere is ways to prepare yourself and see if you can : taking psychology books at the local library, learning about the different diplomas and schools. Taking evening courses.\n\nYou can do all that without putting your current habits upside down.\n\nIf you came never achieve to make a carrier of it, you'll still have the skills. And people skills are invaluable, just on a daily basis.\n\n
6	INTJ, but I'm getting a masters in psych right now- Go for it! Sensors might even be better at psychology than Ns because its all about concrete facts. Psychology isn't about learning how to "read minds" or body language or any of that. It's a science, first and foremost, and I think sensors have the perfect skill set for a scientist. :) \n\nI will warn you though, be careful about majoring in it. Unless you're dead set on being a counselor or getting a PhD, the job market for psych majors is not that good. An undergrad course is the perfect introduction to the subject though! Good luck!
5	Well I never studied it in college, but I took AP psych in high school and sucked it up like a sponge? I don't feel like it was very conceptual at all, honestly. It's a science, not a philosophy class, so there are a lot of very concrete sets of symptoms and stages of development and things like that. The part I had the most trouble with was memorizing all the damned parts of the brain lol. If you like it and you think it's something you would enjoy a career in, go for it!! 
3	[deleted]
3	ISTJ here, I am a psychology major in college and I love it. To me it's not too abstract because in psychology everything has an effect in the real world like understanding how people learn and how memory works. In experiments you have to measure something observable, so it is very concrete most of the time. The only abstract thing (that I personally don't like) is neuroscience, but if you focus on psychology that shouldn't be a problem. \n\nIf social psychology is your thing, you should definitely consider it. It's not a very abstract field and it is likely you can specialize in that area.

1	It's useful info as long as you know about the bias.. How X view Y without knowing much about MBTI is good data, you then know how you are perceived, pitfalls, what to work on, what not to do, your strengths...

2	Worked as a legal secretary for a few years, somehow made it to a state job where I review consultant contracts and sort of liaise between the consultants and the agency.  \n\nI was an English major. It’s a surprisingly good fit for me, what with editing the contracts and learning the lingo and all the details of the process.

3	dealing with frustration	How do you guys deal with frustration? i'm currently feeling it build up in me and don't really see a way to release it and i'm unsure how to address it within my schedule. not until sunday i think. but it got me wondering what is frustration like for other isfj's.\n\ndoes it build up? does it come in small waves between build up and release? does it build up real big and crashes down on everyone around you? do you actively manage it or kind of let it come and go on it's own?
5	For me it comes out in roast sessions or gossip. Not that often but when it does . . . 
5	My brother and I are both ISFJ and we get our frustration out by venting. My brother is more likely to talk about the events/people leading up to his frustration whereas I talk about how i feel and why.\n\nWhen I'm really frustrated about personal stuff, I write/journal and listen to music. When I'm angry-frustrated, I walk. When I'm sad-frustrated, I go to my room and just lay in my bed for a bit till I want to face people again. \n\nIt depends on the circumstances for me though. Ive had spurts of sudden vent sessions with my friends and/of daily little vents with my family. It depends on who's listening. Sometimes i just get suddenly super overwhelmed and I need to get away from people fast once I hit that tipping point. 
2	This is timely, as I'm currently extremely frustrated lol. I find that I'm not very good at dealing with it, kind of like I'm not very good at being sick :/ Fairly minor but drawn-out discomforts are really hard for me to cope with, I guess I prefer for things to just be really bad once and then be over with quickly. \n\nAnyway, I'm a whiny person by nature so I find that mostly I just complain even more aggressively than usual and get more short-tempered. It's also tiring for me to maintain that level of pissiness though, so eventually it'll just kind of fade out and I'll stop caring. 
2	Cliche, but exercise helps me. I don't deal well with stress, but a good work out seems to help. Try kick boxing.
2	I vent to my friends about my problems a majority of the time(bless them for listening to me all the time), but if I don't, sometimes it'll build up and I'll explode if a certain event triggers me. I'm terrible with stress overall though honestly, but going to the gym helps me to destress as well
2	[deleted]
2	What does your schedule have to do with releasing frustration? \n\nEverybody gets frustrated, and everyone has different ways of releasing it. Binding yourself to things like a schedule don't really help as they just restrict you further. I have found that when I'm frustrated I often still want to maintain a positive outward composure towards people, and this just exacerbates the problem. You're not doing ok, and that's alright. You don't have to seem like you are all the time. \n\nI think that it can depend on what the frustration is as well. If it's specifically with another person then one of the best ways to deal with it is probably going to be to confront that person about it. And while the initial confrontation can be hell to go through, it will ultimately result in a better outcome because you've gone to the root of the problem. \n\nYou've got control over your own life, and if things aren't going the way you want them to then the best thing you can do is change them. It can be scary and difficult, but the end result will almost surely be more pleasing that had you never taken the chance in the first place. 
3	Am I truly an ISFJ?	I've started to get into MBTI recently, and I posted on the MBTI subreddit asking for help with typing, and the people there typed me as ISFJ. [link to that thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/75mwby/am_i_an_intp/). \nNote: I'm only 16 and male so that probably doesn't help the case.\n\nBut thinking about it more, I'm not so sure if I am. I'm not very organized at all, and tend to lose things fairly often. I enjoy interacting with new people all the time, even though I'm not very good at it. Also, when I think about it, I hate being completely alone, and I definitely don't fit the description of an introvert where you would need to "recharge" after interaction. Many of my friends describe me as more extroverted as well so IDK. I tend to talk about myself alot, so I have to remind myself to include others in conversation as well. I have no clue about how I feel about conflict tho, i seem to cause alot of it :/. I'm kind of impatient as well when to comes to more selfish things, but if I'm helping others I can wait forever. \n\nDespite all of this, I can definitely relate to alot of the top posts on this subreddit and can see the sides of me that are ISFJ. I do feel left out sometimes among a group of friends, where I feel as if I just don't fit in. I definitely feel more comfortable with friends than I am at home with family. Positive reinforcement is super important to me, and I can get pretty down if I don't get any for a while. Lastly, I tend to feel like I'm always bothering people, so I tend to use "sorry to bother you but..." and if they're doing something "oh, sorry I won't bother you then." Oh yea, and I'm the biggest procrastinator ever(definitely not procrastinating math homework rn).\n\nIf there are any questions that I can answer to help to type myself, please ask them. \n\nThanks for reading, and sorry for the long post.\n\nEdit: Taking tests on websites I've gotten ISFJ on keys2cognition, ENFJ on typeinmind, and INTP and INFP on 16personalities, which I don't really like. The questions feel like they can be influenced by your mood so easily.\n
5	Are you mentally organized? Can you recall specific memories easily? That's the kind of organized I am, but god forbid you ask me to keep a room clean.\n\nWhen I "recharge" it's not always completely alone. Sometimes, for me, being completely alone is still with my boyfriend or my best friend. 
3	I wouldn’t worry about it too much. I think that the 16 types are just basic outlines, the same goes for any other personality profile. We’re just more complex than that. I think there can definitely be people who are combinations both. If you’re trying to discover who you really are, pay attention to how you act think and feel. Add the parts of the personality profiles that apply to you to make your own new description of...well you.  Feel free to add in some of your own insights.  Self discovery is a journey, not a destination. So, again, my advice, don’t worry about fitting into a single group. Just be yourself! Hope this helps! :)
2	All your points sound like an ISFJ except for the conflict thing. Are you intentionally starting them or just seem to start them on accident?
2	How ambitious are ISFJs?	Hey! so I wanted to ask, do you consider yourself ambitious? I feel like I am generally ok with just living with my needs covered and enjoying "simple things", but sometimes, when I see I have a chance to " go further" or achieve something, my ambition increases considerably.\nI think that doubting about my capabilities 'prevents' me from being as ambitious as other types may be, because of fear of failure I guess. But when I evaluate the outcomes and see that I might have a good chance of improving in the 'imaginary-scale-of-what-success-is-supposed-to-be' , I become pretty competitive. What about you? 
9	i have strong ambitions but they are all internal. i want to be my best and i want to be proficient or competent at a bunch of stuff. and i work tirelessly for them. but those things i want aren't based in status and aren't being compared to others in society/my community/environment. it's all about beating my prior self. i look at others and their skills and abilities more as guidance and tips or clues i can learn from to further myself. but i don't care about where i am relative to them.\n\non the other hand, i'm extremely competitive with myself. i can't let past me have the upper hand in anything. and it's extremely stressful.
4	I find as long as I'm passionate about it I can follow through. My friend once described me as someone who gets shit done. I like to smash things out so assignments, things around the house. If something needs fixing I question why nobody's fixed it yet, I think that equates to a high ambition.\n\nOr it equates to a low ambition and a desire to not want to worry about anything for longer than I need to. If it gets done, I no longer have to think about it.
4	I am ambitious as well, I am a doctor, but I am definitely less ambitious than my coworkers. Outside of work I prioritize sleeping and spending time with my family, while a lot of my other co-workers work extra shifts or do research. 
3	My ambition stems from wanting to make my loved ones proud of what I achieved. I also grew up lower-middle class, and money (lack thereof) was often a source bitter conflicts between my parents which left such an impression on me. I wanted to be in a career that would make me comfortable enough to not have to fight with someone over something like money. Plus, I wanted to be able to 'pay-back' or help my family out when I do get established in my career, when they may need help. \nLastly, yes, I do have some plain-ol', 'I wanna be the best' feelings going on, but it is very low-key. 
1	Absolutely. 
1	My ambition is driven by the need to make enough money to maintain taking care of the people I am currently taking care of. Otherwise I would make shit money and live in a secluded cabin but people need me.\nSigh.
7	Alright, I've fallen in love with one of you. How do i do this?	Title says it all. I'm an ENTP dating an ISFJ and simply put I have fallen hard for her. I feel that she's also falling for me and this brings me to my request for advice. How do I keep one of you from getting beyond irritated with me? I don't want to be insensitive and mess up because I enjoy a good argument or because I want to explore an idea further. I want this to actually work. How do I make this work?
6	My boyfriend is an ENTP and I'm an ISFJ and we have been together for almost two years. Because we are opposites there are bound to be disagreements on things. One thing that makes me really stressed out is when my ENTP can't make a plan. Being an ISFJ I live off planning so I really appreciate it when my boyfriend puts in the time to also plan things even when he hates to. That's probably one of the biggest things. Also show your emotions, reassurance is key. We ISFJs are very in touch with our emotions so it's nice to have someone express theirs too. Be open. We love being there for people so allow us to be 
2	Well ENTP here, so I obviously can't speak for ISFJs, and I haven't sat down and thought deeply about this topic.  \n\nBut something that came to my mind was just appreciation. In general love/relationships to me should be about appreciation. Yea of course we are different. But that is okay.  \n\nFor example I really appreciate ISFJs for their warmth, kindness, loyalty. I find it impressive how organized, structured, and practical they can be, because it is my own weak spot.  \n\nIf you really like something about someone, I think it is very great to show appreciation. But it should come out of willingness to appreciate, not forcefulness because you have to. You genuinely have to appreciate it out of love for them.  \n\nThere's tons of nice things I appreciate about ISFJs, and telling them that I appreciate them for it, and the joy I can see in their faces is really priceless and makes me happy too.  \n\nIf you really deeply care about someone, there's nothing better than appreciating them, and making them feel loved and cared for. That you notice all the things they do, big and small, and that it is valued. Because ultimately it translates into you value them for who they are.  \n\nI simply just appreciate them, because I love to do it, not because I have to. It makes me feel wonderful too, and closer connected to them.  \n\nIt is also just basic psychology, if you appreciate a behavior from a certain person you show gratitude towards that behavior, because that gratitude might motivate that person to keep doing it. If they didn't get the gratitude, they might stop that behavior for whatever reason, because well, what is the fruits of it? No one cares anyway, and that is a shame.  \n\n
11	ISFJ sometimes feel like being cruel?...	So I am a pretty much a textbook ISFJ- caring and sensitive, pretty much 90% of the time. But sometimes I go through periods of feeling very callous and cold towards even the closest people in my life...Almost on purpose? Like I consciously choose to act and feel that way. Sometimes I say things that I know will hurt someone, purposefully. \n\nI know it sounds a bit sociopathic almost, but has anyone else experienced this? Is it a symptom of feeling too much like a pushover and wanting to regain control? Just a part of being a human? Something else? Or am I just weird? Hope this makes sense
9	this used to be a scary part of me. i used to always feel like a victim (to others, to life in general, to myself even) and that somehow, being on the other side of it makes me not a victim. \n\nit felt good momentarily to know someone else is the victim. though i didn't understand that that was the reason back then. i just did it and it brought minor emotional relief and a lot of problems and lingering negative feelings i'd carry as a result.\n\nbut after a years of soul searching i've realized that hurting others is still me being a victim. i was still being effected by my hurt. i felt the hurt so much that i had to act on it instead of acting free from it for my own interests. \n\nin a way i was a slave to my hurt and my victim hood. it didn't matter if i sat in it and felt bad or if i was proactive with it and made others feel bad. the only escape was to let it go so that i could be free to do what was best for me.
3	I get this way sometimes too. I find this happens on a few different, but specific, occasions:\n\n- I'm irritated at internal circumstances so I lash out externally at the person I care about.\n\n- My friend is making obviously bad choices, I give advice when they ask, they act like they will listen and then they complain their life sucks when they don't follow said advice. My last resort: brutally cruel honesty.\n\n- Pent up anger. I got walked over for too long with sly insults and stabs at me so it built up and I'm clearly upset.\n\nWith that being said, on these rare occurances, I almost always feel instant regret. It isn't ME speaking and even if it was true, I know there's a more loving and helpful way to say it. My brain just decides in that moment to skip filtering out emotions and to just go for it. Then I feel crappy afterward.
2	Sometimes I get this way as well, so you're not alone. It usually happens when I get very anxious, or when my boyfriend (or someone else) does something that upsets me but I know it's stupid to be upset about it so I just shut him out completely for a little while. I know this is wrong and I know that it really upsets him (and others) because he wants to fix things immediately, and I just can't do that sometimes.  I think this is partly just because I value not arguing over arguing (For the most part, there are some things I will argue about till I am blue in the face).\n\nBut the person I am most awful to when I am this way is my mother. I hate that about myself, for the record, but she is the person I am closest too, she raised me, so she knows all my buttons just like I know a lot of hers.
1	Not an ISFJ, but just take a quick look at my Reddit history.\n\nBeen a few days it's my exclusive topic. If you don't necessarily relate, I'm sure you'll find the words you need for how you feel.
1	Yes. I have been told I have a victim-complex. With the person I am emotionally closest too (my S.O.) I can even exhibit this even more-so, to the point of being selfish sometimes. Maybe it is just a human thing, but I can relate OP
1	I think this roots from not wanting to get hurt, so you “hurt” others first in defense. In my case, I usually isolate myself instead of getting closer to people. To some people, it might come off as I’m “too busy” for them, but really it’s me being guarded.
1	I get this several times throughout each year. I usually will wake up one day with this feeling and I am able to tell that if I don't keep away from every human I know I will look for something to shred them with. I realize I am feeling this way and I can force myself to not react but it's so incredibly strong. It will mostly pass after the darkness arrives then my mood slowly elevates and feel back to normal ... but I will linger about it for days after thinking that I am a shitty person and vow to not feel like that again.
3	How athletic are y’all?	I’d like to think I’m pretty athletic. I’m the best at sports that require hand eye coordination like ping pong, tennis, spikeball and golf. Just wondering if Hand eye coordination or athleticism is common among isfj’s
11	I am 0% athletic lol. I try to be more active, but in my heart I'm a total couch potato, and I'm generally terrible at sports. I played some when I was a kid, but I have no team spirit and prefer to do my own thing and make my own schedule, so I didn't stick with them for long. :P 
3	Absolutely not at all hahaha. My build naturally lends itself well to things like hiking and aerobics (somehow I'm better at hiking naturally than a lot of people I've biked with who've been training), but I have garbage stamina for pretty much anything. I have practically no muscle mass (or any mass for that matter), don't play sports, and never exercise for the sake of exercise. I bike for my commute and hike s couple times a year, and that's it. Exercise is hard hahaha :P 
3	i try to be active. i do weightlifting with cardio 3-4 times a week and just started taking boxing classes once a week.\n\nin the past i practiced nunchucks regularly, did some kung fu, and also played a lot dance dance revolution.\n\nbut i wouldn't say i'm naturally athletic or have good hand eye coordination. i'd say i have really slow reflexes and poor understanding of what my body is doing. i'm just willing to try really hard to improve them in different ways.\n\nthough maybe my perspective on this topic is skewed? maybe my hand eye coordination is good and i just see everything as earned and worked for from nothing?
3	I consider myself pretty good at sports. When I was little I played a lot of football, then I did also some swimming and athletics too. The worst part about sports for me was having to compete, it made me super nervous each time and hated it. \nNow I only do yoga once or twice a week and it's a lot more rewarding in terms of mental sanity haha
2	 Don’t know about athletic, but I’ve got good endurance for exercise. 
2	my ISFJ husband loves sports, plays football, basketball, baseball and golf.
2	I love to play sports , I like baseball and volleyball the most . Right now I'm just running 3 days a week.
2	The longer i do something the better i get. 
2	I'd say that I'm fairly active. I try to go hiking every week (I average about 6 miles), and I like to go kayaking as well. Sometimes I play beach volleyball with friends, but I've never really been one for competitive sports.
2	I mean, if you count marching band then yes. Other than that nothing really.
1	My isfj  husband loves basketball, hockey, baseball, badminton, and excelled in volleyball. He kind of thrived on the competition, but only when it wasn't taken too seriously. \n\nMe on the other hand, I clam up when it comes to competition. But I do love taking our ball and gloves to the park or having a good rally, and I found when I was younger I've got good footwork so we enjoy taking my nieces and nephews out to play soccer. If I applied myself, I'd probably be a lot better. I mostly avoided team sports because of the competition aspect, but now regret it.
1	I got into crossfit and weightlifting this past year and I absolutely love it. Going to the gym is my favorite part of the day, and I love researching different techniques and ways I can improve. Before this year, I considered myself a non-athletic type, but something about weightlifting just clicks with me
1	Nope.
5	Who’s our ideal type for friendships and/or relationships?	Everyone knows the bond that ENFPs and INTJs share.  Which type suits us best? Would it be the ESTP?
8	Infj with an isfj. Goes pretty well. I try to limit the random non-applicable questions I ask so I don't get annoying, but I've never been judged on it and have only been kindly complemented for thinking differently, which makes me feel good. I've made an effort to have more small talk about more tangible stuff, which drove me crazy at first, but I've come to associate meaning with it in that we generally care about the specific aspects of each other's lives that no one else cares about and our small talk is therefore a demonstration of love that doesn't occur that way with anyone else. \n\nFeelings wise, on point. Super supportive of each other and completely mutual. Very kind and sensitive to each other's feelings and we both ask personal things in non offensive ways. Have never had an argument because we are both very calm in conflict and genuinely listen to each other in non judgement ways (or if it is something we stand on, we approach it sensitively and try to understand the other's point of view while explaining why we think like we do). \n\nWas frustrated at one point by a lack of opening up but that openness has gotten greater with time which is comforting to me because I know it won't be closed off forever. \n\nI've also realized that where I talk to think, ISFJs think and then talk, so silence on the other person's part does not mean a lack of opinion nor a disregard for what I am saying, it is just being processed and thought about....often times ISFJ brings it up hours later with some really deep aspect or further comment when I had assumed he said all he wanted to and moved on. \n\nI've learned to express something and then just wait, only bringing it up later if nothing changes and he doesn't also bring it up later\n\nOverall feels like ecstasy. The subconscious knowing of each other's feelings and moods makes things wonderful. We both want stability and peace and predictability so that works too :)
5	Besides fellow ISFJs, I get along well with INFJs, INFPs, and ESFJs. I can hang out with ESFPs, but I've learned not to take their tendency to be flaky personally.\nHowever, I'm dating an INTJ and we have an awesome relationship, it just took a while for him to open up. 
2	How do I make an ISFJ like me	How do I make my ISFJ crush like me, is just naturally being ENTP (their dual) enough? 
11	Honestly, just give them your time and attention. Show them you care, it goes way longer than you may think. We ISFJs are content to just be with the ones we love. Also, be genuine. We’re pretty good at being able to tell when you’re not being genuine. Open up to them, let them know they can trust you and you them. All of that, little by little and you better believe they’ll be loyal, and you better be in return. 
2	Just be you. I like everyone as long as they seem genuine to me. Also we like to know we're loved/appreciated, etc. and can be a little dense about noticing it if it's not spelled out explicitly. So don't be shy about saying how you feel. As with all dual relationships, you may need time to "grow on" one another so just give it time.
1	Short answer: you don't.\n\nWho someone likes is 100% their choice.
17	We can be smart!	I resisted identifying as ISFJ for a long time. I think SFs in particular are generally assumed to be dumb or at least not nearly as smart as those brilliant NTs or whatever.\n\nMy IQ is 140+. I was valedictorian of my high school class. I have lots of high-level discussions with my friends, I love art and intellectually challenging activities, and I easily make connections between seemingly disconnected things.\n\nBut I'm undoubtedly an S. I can't stand impracticality and dreams that aren't grounded in reality. I'm observant. And Si is huge with me. It doesn't mean that I'm traditional and that I wear really generic clothing and I always follow the rules and always do exactly what my parents ask of me. It simply means that I value experience. That's it. Seriously.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to dispel some of the myths about us. Part of the reason it can be so hard to type ourselves is because of how poorly understood most of the MBTI types are.
14	Hello, I'm a Ne dom, and I've been tested at 127, when I was around five. A bit more than twenty years ago. (It means I'm somewhat of an average idiot by now. I'm just so prideful of an intelligence I apparently don't have I reach my intellectual limits constantly, unable to learn. I'm the opposite of OP, proving him/her right.)\n\nI used to be an average student, and am a college dropout NEET for the last five years. I'm an active internet user for the last fifteen years, but always lived with computers around.\n\nDon't believe what's written about your type around the Internet : it's because we're the masters here, and we're jealous.\n\nSensors get shit done, with maximum comfort and efficiency. When I struggle on my daily chores, I take it as a reminder it's me who's unfit.\n\nThe statistics says the same : Around 6% of Ne doms, intuitives are minority. ISTJ most represented, with ISFJs in second. You're the most represented among women.\n\nISTJs are found surrepresented in high responsibilities roles in the work place : CEOs, Directors, engineers. \n\nDon't bow in front of our bullshit. You're people of integrity.\n\n---\n\nPS : "Valuing experience" is the best way to explain Si-Fe I've ever seen. 
9	Yeah the idea of sensors as lower intellectual beings can be really grating. I literally once had someone ask me if I was sure I wasn't INFJ because I was so good at understanding people and concepts lol.... \n\nI try not to pat myself on the back for my intelligence too much because it just doesn't seem like a nice thing to do, and it's something that's largely out of my control, anyway. But at the same time, it can be interesting to observe differences. Backstory: I dropped out of college for mental health reasons. I've always done quite well in school and my professors were pretty dismayed when I left lol, but I couldn't handle the pressure after basically sleeping my way through high school, still making good grades, and walking into college totally unprepared. \n\nSo these days I honestly do feel less intelligent without the constant mental stimulation that school provides, but still, in day-to-day life sometimes there are things that are interesting to note. I pick things up faster than a lot of people; it's easier for me to memorize patterns and tasks, and to understand the reasoning behind what I'm doing. At this point I'm just a part-time cashier, but I still understand why and how the dumb credit card machines work the way they do better than my coworkers lol. It's a silly example, but that kind of thing happens a lot, even though I'm chronically exhausted and my memory is horrible. Not all the time; I'm basically useless in math beyond basic arithmetic, for example, and sometimes random things will just straight up refuse to click in my brain. But often things that other people struggle with just seem to flow more naturally for me. \n\nAnd honestly, I think my intelligence is *because* of my type, not in spite of it. Being able to pull from stores of data to make connections between situations and subjects is an incredibly useful skill to have! It's wonderful for analyzing and for cementing things in your memory by placing them in a context and creating an interconnected web of knowledge that backs your understanding of whatever the task or idea at hand is. I think part of the reason I'm so bad at math is because I don't have anything to connect it to; it all feels like totally random and isolated principles, and I have trouble making sense of it without a context to place it in. \n\nAnyway, that's enough rambling from me haha, thanks for sharing your thoughts/experience! It's always good to fight back against stereotypes, and the online mbti community can be ridiculously unfair to sensors :/ 
6	For whatever reason, the idea of being nice and the idea of being intelligent at the same time are hard for people to grasp. I live my life as mindfully as I can and always try to be kind first. But, I'm a phd student in Biology and I constantly feel like no one takes me seriously because I am more than willing to put other people first. As annoying as it is, I would much rather people underestimate me and feel good about being kind than people taking me more seriously because I'm not.
7	Thank you. I also had trouble accepting I was an isfj for the minor achievement of "not being dumb as rocks." Over the years, I've written a virtual novel on how s-type misconceptions skew online mbti demographics and discussion. I eventually gave up and I only check in here now and again. It's nice to see people still fighting the good fight. 
8	I agree. The assumption that ISFJs aren't very bright gets annoying.   I will say that I don't remember facts (history, etc..) well, but I think that we are very good at understanding concepts and people. I feel like I'm ahead of the other person in the conversation a lot of the time.  And I can't figure out why, but it seems like people with Te (intj, entj, etc..) are always underestimating me. Like In conversations, I'll completely understand what they are saying, but it's like they treat me as if I have no concept of the way anything works, which can be annoying.  I'm a computer science student at a university currently, and I feel like we can be just as good, if not better, at problem solving and logical thinking than other thinking types.  Sorry for the jumbled response, I'm just throwing my thoughts out there 
3	I didn't know that's what people thought of isfj's. Hahaha.
3	Tested at 143, ISFJ too\n\n\n
2	Even if it's not perfect, that would be cool to see 
2	Apparently since I was born a 'genius' (through tests because my behavior learning patterns were weird as a channel) doing well in school and being a general rational thinker I think people have seen me as a Thinker type and cant possibly be a Feeler Type 
1	Yeah the stereotypes are so stupid. I’m an ISFJ an Accounting major who’s doing very well in that major. I think it’s just that intuitives are rarer than sensors so they automatically think they are smarter. I might not like dealing with abstract concepts like effective intuitives can. However sensors are much better with the practical concerns. For example, I am able to mermize a concrete concept or procedure like data, fact numbers and be able to apply it on an exam and daily life. So yeah sorry for the mini rant but ISFJs can be smart and don’t let anyone tell you different! Besides I think the stereotypes of NTs being smarter than SFs are stupid, we all are intelligent in our own way and we should all respect our differing levels of intelligence . \n\nTL,DR: ISFJs have a great logistical and administrative intelligence compared to intuitives

10	I'm curious what male isfj's are like romantically...you hear a lot about females but not males. What's your way of best showing love? How do you want to receive love? What sets a lover apart from everyone else in your life? How would you describe ideal intimacy for you? Thank you!!	
8	Touch and words is how I show affection. Touch stuff is hand holding, leaning my head against hers, and cuddling. Words are genuine. And I pay attention to the person's emotional state and will talk about it with the person.\n\nMost people i want to spend limited amount of time with, a lover I'd like to spend some more time with. Also I get moments of fuzzy vision around a lover where it's like a movie and the background gets blurry and all I can see is the person.\n\nThe intimacy I seek is based in a relationship where both me and the other person are compassionate people, caring for others together, and pushing and helping each other to care for and be compassionate with ourselves.
4	Words foremost, touch is secondary. Texting is okay but I much prefer talking on the phone or face-to-face. That way I can read your emotions. Someone who I can enjoy moments with and communicate problems and find compromise. Someone who will listen to my wisdom and I will do likewise.
4	My husband and I are both isfj. It makes some things complicated, but it's been awesome for our relationship because we need the exact same things, so we can easily give.\n\nHe needs a lot of reassurance that I like what he's doing, how he looks, that I appreciate his contribution to our marriage. And he needs physical touch. We often did our homework next to each other so we could touch butts while doing our own thing. We always fall asleep touching.\n\nSexually, he just needs to know that I'm as into it as he is. He's a very selfless lover and really wants me to enjoy it. I'm the same way with him, so our give and take works out perfectly.\n\nAnd one thing I love about us is that I would give him the world, I always try to serve him by making food or cleaning the house or bringing him a treat from the store, and when he gets to the dishes before me, I ALWAYS appreciate it because it's something I could have done myself, and it wasn't an expectation. He feels the same way so our duties get naturally split up equally, with very few expectations of who should do what. The balance is key though, our relationship would go downhill fast if it were one-sided. We would feel unacknowledged, disrespected, used, and unappreciated. 
2	Do you tend to take control of situations sexually or do you like a give and take or do you like it when she takes control? Or does it depend? 
1	[deleted]
1	This sounds like my current relationship with an ISFJ. Thank you for helping. Especially thank you for writing so much as it helps me to understand. \n\nOnly if you feel comfortable, but what is your sense of sexuality....like as an ISFJ, are you more romantic? Aggressive? Sensitive? Gentle? 
1	Would you say you naturally share personal information with a SO if he/she has not specifically asked it? And why either way? 
1	GREAT answer! Yeah my ISFJ boyfriend is sweet and sensitive and gentle, but he's so strong and physically imposing (body size, not attitude), and his voice is so deep that he naturally comes across as extremely manly. He's super gentle though and self sacrificing and always makes sure I'm taken care of first...he's wonderful! I do have to say though...once in a while he'll get a little fire if I tease him too much and establish dominance hahahah he always makes sure I'm comfortable though lol
1	Well I said explicitly that I hope to be trusted, and was told that I was...is that an ISFJ just saying he trusts you to make you happy? Or is that actual trust? He said I could ask him anything...and when I do, he gets pretty deep, but he doesn't volunteer it. I have to dig. Does this sound familiar or no? 
1	Thank you! That helps a lot 
3	Hey! ENTP here in need of some counsel.	Hey everyone so basically I'm friends with an ISFJ and it would be romantic if it were not for the 12 hour time difference (I'm in the USA and she is in the UAE) \n\nPreface:Prior to her recent and large move to the UAE this wasnt an issue.\n\nAnyways I care about her very much and I know she cares about me but I struggle in showing it at times. Due to mainly who I am as a T and the time difference and me getting obsessively caught up in activities i do throughout the day or night. She playfully jokes that I ignore her or dont care for her and it's funny but I know there's some truth behind that. I feel bad because I'm not as caring or emotional as I feel like I should be, I try to reassure her as much as I can but idk I feel like our communication styles can be such a huge barrier sometimes because she often feels like I dont want her or that she annoys me, she constantly apologizes for her little quirks even though I love those things about her. Does anyone have any advice for an ENTP who feels like he doesnt understand??\n\nTL;DR She's really nice and I'm a jerk but I care about her I just suck at being emotional and I feel bad about that. Anything I can do to bridge the gap and have her stop thinking I don't like her or want her around?
4	Even if she’s not awake send her an email or a text to let her know you’re thinking about her.
4	Male ENTP here, been with my ISFJ for 9 years.\n\nGenerally an ISFJ and ENTP can understand eachother very well. We use the same functions in reverse after all... \n\nThink of it as: The ISFJ is doing math. The ENTP is also doing math but he's dyslexic and trying to solve the problem backwards... how ever they both are intending to accomplish the same thing long term.\n\nDuring daily activities the ENTP is in the flow state of Ne... absorbing and processing a ridiculous amount of new information. During the day for an ISFJ, she is operating off of carefully structured internalized experiences.\n\nIt's reversed when the ENTP and ISFJ are doing something relaxing that they enjoy. The ENTP want's to enjoy something nostalgic that he knows will give him a good time... such as eating the same dinner at the same restraunt. On the other hand, the ISFJ is getting excited about the idea of ordering a new meal or buying movies she's never seen before.\n\n---\n\nGetting practical here, I agree with /u/Kaelaface.\n\nDo practical, tangible things to show you appreciate her... not just sharing ideals or your newest interest, hoping that she's reciprocate.\n\nSend her messages, hand written letters. A shipment of goodies... things that she will actually remember.\n\nISFJ's want stability. If she likes you and feels that you provide a sense of stability of a real lasting relationship, then it's a done deal - regardless of distance.
4	ISFJ here, been romantic with my ENTP for about 8 years, but were friends for many years before that. The best thing to do is be truly honest about the way that your brain works. It may take several tries to get the words right so that she understands, but once you both understand each other's communication styles, it really helps. 
3	It means something to me when my INTP bf buys me a movie or something similar that I really enjoyed. It means that he is listening to me when I talk about something I love, and he is thinking of me when we’re not together.\n\nEdit: Anything that lets me know that he is thinking of me when we’re apart is wonderful. Even short texts just saying he misses me while we’re at work.
4	ISFJ Male - How did you meet your wife?	Isfj male in college, and it seems I don't meet women who I'm interested in ever. I'm starting to wonder if it will ever happen if I'm not being gregarious. Just wondering if any males have met their (loving) wives by not being the gregarious type, and would like to hear if you sucked it up and talked to pretty strangers
6	I'm an isfj guy in college as well and I have a lot of trouble finding women. I guess cause I don't really put myself out there. To be honest, I'm not sure I know how 
6	Not my wife, but my girlfriend who I intend to marry. We met through a mutual friend who we both kinda hang out with on occasion, but happened to be the same occasion on that night. I thought she was cute and funny so I asked our mutual friend for her number and we went from there! Eventually I got the courage to ask her out on a date and then did the typical, “well this was fun, we should do this again sometime!” and she just kept saying yes!
2	I am an INFJ and I met my ISFJ hubby in college. He was quiet & shy and so was I. I shyly flirted with him during a field trip and he asked me out.
2	Another work around is asking your buddies for an introduction. Ask them to have a think of who to match you with...and you can start with something you are interested in...say you watch Better Call Saul....then take it from there. :)\n\nIf you get to the point of frustration...you can channel your energy in improving yourself (like getting to the point of being able to start a conversation with any stranger --- potential relationship interest or not)...and working on the projects your excited about while widening your network. Repeat the introduction request...until you find your right match!
1	My ex husband is an ISFJ. When I studied his friend was a roommate of me. He walked upstairs, we looked each other in the eyes and the spark was there immediately. We have been in a relationship for six years. It was a wonderful time and we still have contact. \n\nI was the one who had the courage to go to my roommates room with the lamest excuse ever. He took the first step for my number and a date.
1	I did online dating in University. I had a ton of trouble with being romantically bold in person due to shyness and confidence. I had more success researching profiles with shared interests, and having time to think about handling text based conversation helped me a ton. It's been 8 years since I met my amazing wife and I am one happy man :D
1	Eharmony 
3	What’s your opinion on INFP’s and what has your experience been with INFP’s? Both friendship &/or romantic wise.	Explain the dynamic if you had one please
5	Got two friends. Good people. They tend to be stressed about social situations. One friend forces herself to hangout with people but is stressed and hates attention. The other sometimes just heads back home halfway to a party. \n\nBoth are idealistic and hopeful. They want to believe the best in people and look for reasons to. As an ISFJ, it's nice to spend time with that kind of optimism. \n\nThey are happy and feel relief and comfort to be open about themselves when talking with me. and I force myself to that for personal health, but it's a lot easier with them. Their optimism and good will is disarming.
2	I personally feel like I'm inexorably drawn to INFPs; my lifelong best friend is an INFP, and at one point I was crushing super hard on a cute INFP girl.\n\nI love their gentle nature, which makes them easy to open up to right off the bat. I love their whimsical ideas, which helps liven up boring, pragmatic me. And I admire the fact that every INFP I know can create awesome pieces of art and poetry, which I couldn't do to save my life.
3	ISFJs, genuine opinion on INTPs.	Title is self explanatory. I am very interested.
4	Male ISFJ. Top notch. I married one.\n\nI need validation of feelings. She needs validation of ideas. I need to be useful to her. She needs intellectual respect and encouragement from me. \n\nWhat drew us together was our ease of conversation. It may not be strictly personality based, but we converse on the same wavelength. We "get" eachother. Well, most of the time. It's tough conveying feelings and getting sympathy sometimes, and that can be where the big fights happen. But by attacking the problem and not eachother has enabled us to get through those.
1	I fell in love with one. Dated on and off for 3 years. We couldn't get past the emotional/logical differences though. Opinion: Love 'em! 
1	I love my INTP, but we are VERY different and sometimes it causes problems but we love each other so we try not to let it come between us.
1	Ugh! I had a terrible experience with one who claims to be INTP. But he also claims to be INTp/ILI in Socionics which is usually INTJ so who knows if he's really INTP. \n\nHe just dropped me like a hot potato after 3 months and hundreds of hours of talking. We had started to annoy each other. I would have just let the relationship die a slow death. He stealthy unfriended me without any explanation so that I only found out when I accidentally facebook called him one day and saw he had to "accept my message request." When I asked for an explanation, he suggested he was helping me to help myself since he was no good for me. WTF!
35	Is it common for ISFJs to feel like they never truly belong?	The title should say "rarely" as opposed to "never"\n\nI was wondering if it is a common occurrence for ISFJs to feel like they rarely truly belong socially, no matter where they find themselves.\n\nOne example would be among a group of friends, feeling a disconnect although there is no external evidence to support this (still being included, still participating, but feeling somewhat or very disconnected).\n\nAnother example would be in a classroom, naturally ending up alone, or being/working with friends/acquaintences but still feeling like you're the odd one out but not being able to explicitly identify why (nothing obvious sets you apart).\n\nEven in a one on one situation feeling somewhat disconnected and unable to properly express yourself, your thoughts, reactions etc to the other person to the extent that you feel your actions and contributions are mechanical and robotic (despite caring about the person  and experiencing genuine emotions inside).
11	I don't know if it's common, but it is definitely something I relate to. I almost never feel like I "belong," no matter who I'm with. It doesn't necessarily make me sad, but it is a feeling that inevitably creeps up in just about every social setting.
8	I definitely relate. When I express that feeling, I either get apathy or pandering, neither of which help. I want commonality, not distance or pity, and certainly not just because I asked for it. So yeah, I don't express that anymore. The periphery is where I find myself. \n\nThe situations I found the most belonging are with my coworkers after being there several years, with my team mates at about the end of a season, and with my classmates the junior through senior years of college. So... I guess it takes time. Still working on it with my wife. It's going okay. :)\n\nBut I've been kind of down lately. So take this with a grain of salt.
8	I think ISFJs are quite well set-up for overthinking thanks to our function stack, honestly. Si and Fe give us lots of info about (and focus on) stuff like how things have gone in the past, the behaviors and emotions we've seen other people express, what we expect them to look or sound like when they're feeling or thinking a certain thing, how different factors influence situations, how we think interactions should go in order to achieve certain outcomes, etc etc. I know personally I'm a big observer of that sort of thing, taking in impressions and "data" about day-to-day interactions. So I think it's easy for us to end up with a lot of presuppositions about what social interactions should look like?\n\nBut then we have Ti and Ne towards the bottom of our stack. Ti can help us analyze those interactions, but I think that "logical" aspect can be really easily colored or twisted by our other functions unless we've spent a lot of time developing it. And Ne is the "what if" part of our brain that takes all of those picked-apart pieces from Ti and runs wild with them, often in a more negative direction since it's our inferior function. I think it becomes easy to take those pieces and weave them into a picture where you feel like an outsider, or think yourself into a corner where you feel very uncertain about people's feelings and your standing in their eyes. \n\nI dunno, maybe that's not really what you meant, and if so I apologize for rambling! I've just been seeing a lot of similar discussions lately and thinking about why so many of us might end up feeling that way, and this is one direction that it took me. (I also could be very off-base, so if people have different interpretations I would be interested in hearing them!) 
5	I'm almost 36, married and still feel disconnected from everyone. Really starting to feel like being connected to other humans is a fallacy. I feel more connected to walls than people.
4	This sounds like me in every way. To quote Marge Simpson "I havent had a friend in years." Primarily because of school and work and when I do have free time I spend it playing video games, working out and most importantly, my family. But yeah I feel very different than most personality wise to the point where most people annoy me but I am actually a kind hearted person which most people can't see.
3	I've felt this way my entire life...
3	I  can completely relate to this. Even with groups of friends I've had since childhood, I can feel out of place and like I don't really belong. I constantly worry that people don't actually like me and whether they are asking out of pity or feel like they have to. I have to remind myself that it's all in my head and that people wouldn't ask if they didn't want to. I've always felt on the periphery of things which most of the time I'm pretty happy with to be honest as I can be quite a solidarity person. 
2	It sure seems that way
2	Odd feelings among people (no matter who you are with) are due to resistance you build in interaction with others. Mind tends to overload itself even in simplest interaction even with people you know for years. The only problem is that you let you mind lure you into thought chain which is completely irrelevant in current situation. \nLet me tell you example from my perspective: \nI got a friend, I know her many years, we know each other so well she could be my sister or even more. Many times when we are together something she say or do something that grabs my attention and my mind instantly tries to analyze what's behind. Maybe she got new sweater, mind instantly starts to think compulsively... nice sweater, where did she buy it? Did she get it from someone? Does she have a new boyfriend? \nAnd so on.. It's like dog which caught some smell and run out for it without consideration where he might end after all.\nThis compulsive thinking is the root of our feeling of disconnection. You are never fully present.\n\nBut there's a hope :)\n\n1. You might try a little trick which could help you overtime... try to watch your thoughts as you think. When you realize that mind is extending your initial thought into unnecessary chain, just try to revert back to thought where you started, without judging that fact and expanding it to unnecessary heights.\nMost of these unnecessary thoughts are not real anyway and you know that :) \n\n2. It's completely normal to feel disconnected, if you need someone nearby you can ask someone to come over or go and visit someone. It's our introverted nature to feel somehow strange around people, but it doesn't mean other people don't feel odd too sometimes :)
2	I've been wondering this question for years. Knowing that I'm not the only one who thinks about these kinds of questions makes me feel more comfortable with myself.
2	I feel this way a lot too. I try really hard not to because I need and want friends. It's not that I prefer being alone, I just want our connection to be sincere, and I overanalyze whether it is or not. I always assume that I'm an inconvenience. Which feels unhealthy. So I tend to not reach out and set up dates with friends, and when we do, I'm usually the one ending it early to "get out of their hair." This makes all my phone calls short too. \n\nWhen I find someone that I don't feel this disconnect with, I cling to that person for dear life. My husband being the main one. I get a rush of comfort when I leave the scary social world just to sit on the couch with him. I don't have to worry about our connection being sincere.
2	I can relate. Sometimes when you make a joke in a group and no one laughs. I would think this group don’t like me anymore. Like I care what they think about me or I just overthink too much
7	ISFJ being interrupted	So last night the guy I'm seeing (ESTJ) came over and we were watching tv. Several days ago, I began to tell him about a story that had gone on at work that was interesting to us both and I told him I'd get back to him when I found out more details. Last night, as I began to tell him, I said "before I tell you what happened.." I was beginning to tell him how something that happened yesterday directly correlated with last week's events. \n\nWell, he completely interrupts, says "I don't want to hear about anything else. Just tell me about last week's situation." I really did think that what I had to say was interesting enough that he'd want to hear. I started again "But no, this goes with last...." I get cut off again, getting talked over so I couldn't say anything at all. At this point, I instinctively just said quietly, "I will not say anything then" and completely shut down. \n\nHe tried to joke a bit after that but I gave yes or no responses. While he did stay over, we didn't speak much at all after that. This morning, as we both left, we didn't really say anything and just went about our way.\n\nUsually, we just joke about differences/things like this but not this time. He's an ESTJ so he's a VERY strong personality, but over time I've gotten used to that. We both are playful so it's always been okay. This time, though, things were different. \n\nAm I being too sensitive? I'm not even sure what I'm feeling right now. Sad? Hurt? Annoyed? Should I reach out to him? Should I wait? How would you feel as an ISFJ?\n\nThank you.\n
11	Honestly, if someone did that to me, I probably would've reacted similarly.\nPersonality type aside, I feel like that was a really rude thing to do.
5	You’re not over sensitive; that’s rude as fuck. I would’ve reacted the same, but be more visibly angry and call him out on it. \n\nI’m sorry he did that to you. I hate it when people take advantage of someone else’s kindness/ tolerance and use it (or his own personality type, too) as a free pass to be a complete dickhead. What a terrible listener and friend.\n
6	My wife is ISFJ, I am INTP, we just discussed this, and we both agree this is a red flag. His actions show disrespect for you as a person, and this is not likely to change unless he is confronted on it.\n \nI have over the years become used to my wife's more "rambling" way of communication. I just learned to make a mental note of which points I hope she touches on by the time she is done with her story, and remind her if she doesn't get back to the point she started on if it is important to my understanding of what she had to say. This has been a learned behavior/adaptation on my part.\n\nNo one deserves to be talked over and silenced, freedom of expression (especially in a relationship) is a basic human right and communication is a cornerstone of a successful and respectful relationship. Some people just need to learn to listen with more patience, and the habit of talking over others can be unlearned with practice and the willingness to do so. Unless you are prepared for even more disrespectful and controlling behavior, you need to let him know you won't tolerate it, and go from there.  \n\n\n
3	For that ESTJ to become not "accidentally" overbearing, he might require a lobotomy. Ask yourself if that procedure would be possible or worth it.
2	My mom and dad have this kind of relationship. Im pretty sure theyre both ESTJ and ISFJ too\n\n
2	>I get cut off again, getting talked over so I couldn't say anything at all. \n\nI want to know what he said in that moment when he talked over you the second time.
2	Just chiming in to add another confirmation that yeah, that was ridiculously rude and you have every right to feel however you want about it. I'm maybe a bit harsh, but that's the kind of thing that would turn me off of a person completely and probably permanently, especially when there seems to be no explanation for it. Personally, I'd wait for him to apologize and just move on if he doesn't, but if he's really worth it to you I guess you could reach out. 
1	Sounds like my ESTJ ex.\nWas this a one time situation or does he usually not have patience for your conversation?  Maybe he had a stressful day?\nEven though my ESTJ always cut me off to get to the point he eventually saw how much it meant to me to express those details, so he would try to sit through it on days he was feeling sweet and adoring.  He made it clear that the additional details he sat through were a compromise or an act of love to bridge our different communication styles.  Yeah, he was an asshole and he doesn't deny it.
1	It’s rude but you also have to learn why someone would do this. It’s unlikely he doesn’t respect you but rather that he is not able (yet) to communicate his preferences in a nicer way. \nMy ISFJ mom does the rambling on about a lot of factual details (often people at work) that I don’t care about. I’m a bottom line, big picture person and want to know the main point and then fill in details later, if needed. I notice S types, especially sensing dominants (ISxJ and ESxP) like to build a picture detail by detail, often chronologically. This is excruciatingly dull for people like me. \nESTJs can be “get to the point” people because they like efficiency and may not be deeply interested in details about people. \nSo with people like that, don’t build up to the main point. Just get to the heart of the matter and then they may he more patient with the extra details. \nThat doesn’t excuse his rudeness though. I wouldn’t assume he knew there is a problem. ISFJs expecting people to “just know” often compounds their problem because they get hurt waiting for people to change who don’t know there’s a problem. Figure out what you’re feeling and what you need. Then communicate that with “I feel” statements. Avoid “you” blaming statements. \n
11	How do you guys deal with loneliness?	
13	Honestly? This is not the healthy response I'm sure, but I usually just remind myself it's my fault anyway for being basically a hermit and hunker down with a good distraction. Trying to reach out to people and having awkward, shallow interactions just makes me feel worse, so I keep to myself, and probably will continue to do so until I feel capable of being a better friend. 
4	I may not be the best example because I have many friends and I think I rarely ever feel truly lonely. However, there are some nights or weekends where everyone is doing something and I have nothing to do but stay at home and pass the time. Thoughts start running through my head like, why does no one want to spend time with me? I'm just worthless? I'm so needy, I can't even go a weekend without hanging out with my friends. On these nights I think I feel lonely, but in reality I probably am quite needy, and I'm so used to hanging out with them every week that when I don't, I start questioning everything. \n\nI think true loneliness isn't necessarily about having no friends or no one in your life to talk to. I don't know your situation but, loneliness can happen when you feel there's no one you can be honest with or genuine. I have experienced this before where I have many friends and I hang out with them a lot, but none of them give me the opportunity to vent, to say how I truly feel and to have that be reciprocated in the same conversation. This may be an isfj thing or just a human thing, but I crave connection. I hate small talk, and I love those deep personal one on one conversations you can have with other people. It's in those moments that the feeling of loneliness flies out the window, and so I always strive to reach that in friendships. \n\nLike I said before, I don't know much about your situation. If you don't have many friends I would say try and put yourself out there, the usual things like go to places and join clubs etc where you think it might give you an opportunity to socialise. After that that, you just need to follow it up by asking to hang out some weekend. I would also say, try to just be yourself, people love genuine people and if you're a sound guy/gal you will attract friends like a magnet. \n\nIf you do have friends but you feel you have no one to be honest with, try to maybe get one of your closest friends by themselves. This will give you an opportunity to hang out and talk on a more personal level, and if they're a good friend they'll welcome that. \n\nOn the topic of temporarily coping with loneliness, occupy yourself. Make sure you have something to do, whether that's chores in the house, weekly shopping, or more leisurely activities like reading a book or playing a game. Try to distract your mind so that you won't think about those negative self pitying thoughts that won't do you any good. If you live with your family, maybe try to hang out with them, or atleast talk to them, once again I don't know your situation.\n\nThis is just a little bit of advice from someone who really hasn't felt true loneliness much in his life, however, everyone does at some stage. It's just something to expect in life, especially these days when it's so easy to fall into its grasp. Although it might seem difficult to connect with people, once you put yourself out there and try to connect with them, you'll realise that connection is all they ever wanted, it's all anyone ever wanted. We are not much different when it comes to basic human needs. 
3	I like my alone time, a lot. But yes, I go through bouts of loneliness too but the lonelier I get, the more I want to be by myself. It's almost like I have to sort it out myself and I feel like a burden to someone if I go out with them in my bout of loneliness. It wouldn't be fair anyway because even if I manage to find someone to hang out with, by the time I drive home, I'm still feeling lonely and as I'm spending time with them, I still feel lonely so what's the point? Might as well hunker down on my own and go through it since it will pass in time.
2	Heh. Badly ?\n\nI should really read other's answer. Maybe there's insight.
2	This is such a difficult question, I don’t even really know an answer to it myself. Every time I feel extremely lonely, I just feel like losing my mind and keep thinking how I’m going to get rid of this feeling, but I guess I just do things that I like and focus on them. Or if you have some friends, try to talk to them and if they don’t seem interested, do what makes you feel good. Maybe get to know new people on the internet. I barely feel lonely because I often enjoy being alone, but when I do, it makes me feel really anxious. 
2	I'm a textbook case of the [Si-Ti loop](http://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/133090287772/accurate-typing-tertiary-temptation), so basically I deal with it by spending all of my time alone focused on various distractions, instead of dealing with it in a healthy way lol. I know I need to develop my Fe if I ever want to feel any better, but that's too scary and I don't know how to begin lol
3	ENTP?	What do you think of them and what experiences did you have with them? 
4	Married to one. We are completely opposite of each other but still have the same goals in life, so it works well. There were many times when we butted heads early in the relationship while we were still learning how we communicate. For example, I’m more reserved with my word while he spoke whatever come to his mind. ENTPs also tend to debate their way out of things, but I’ve learned how to handle that as well.
3	[deleted]
2	At this point in my life, all the ones I've met have pissed me off lol. They've mostly struck me as needlessly argumentative (and not in what I would consider a fun, respectful, debatey kind of way; it's always been more of a stubborn, "well you're wrong" kind of tone) and needlessly rude, which, as an ISFJ, are two of the worst things you could possibly be imo. They've also tended to come off rather condescending and/or self-pitying, which is a combination that's pretty much guaranteed to raise my blood pressure. \n\nI am always interested to see that there are ISFJs who have had wonderful experiences with them though, and I hope some day I'll be mature enough to meet a similarly mature ENTP and get along well. 
1	I tend to think they don't much care. Ask other ENTPs : we're more volubile about whatever you have in mind.
2	How did you discover your type?	I dived deep into cognitive functions; when I resurfaced the whole world was suddenly clearer. 
7	I literally just settled into this type! It took a lot of researching and introspection though. Before I had been consistently getting either INFP or INFJ in quizzes, and never really identified with either, so I just brushed off the whole MBTI concept. It's only in the last couple of days that I finally learned about the cognitive functions underlying the types, so I spent a lot of time trying to understand them, and took a couple function quizzes as well to supplement my understanding of the functions. What ultimately solidified it for me was [this function guide](http://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/theory) because it broke down how each function operates in each level of the stack. That's when I clearly saw how ISFJ is the most accurate way of describing me!
3	I took the Myers-Briggs test to discover my type. 
2	My boyfriend at the time (an ENFP) got into MBTI and had me take a test, he thought I was an INFP I think. But yeah, ISFJ in every test I took. Been quite into it ever since then.
2	I've tested as INTJ, ISTJ, and ISTP. I was settled on ISTJ after typing myself with functions but my friends who are super knowledgeable in MBTI and Socionics said that I had way too much Fe to be ISTJ. So I humored them and considered ISFJ. Now I feel a relief to admit I'm a feeler, lol. \n
1	Typology-focused Discord server that caters specifically to IxFx types	Hey everyone. I just wanted to share an invite link to a Discord server I'm on, Cognition. The admin loves IxFx types, and so the server has a higher proportion of introverts and feelers compared to other typology servers. That being said, it's an inclusive community and all types are welcome, so feel free to join even if you aren't an introvert or a feeler.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/Tsg4sUd
2	Do y'all have neat or messy handwriting?	Mine is extremely messy!
9	Mine is a mix of both. I see it as messy, others see it as neat. It also switches between print and cursive. 
4	messy, but I've been told my handwriting looks like it could be a quirky font lol 
5	So messy it works as a personal secret code.
2	mine is the neatest people have seen
2	Probably more on the messy side? Mine tends to be a little loopy on my g, j, and y, which can make it a little hard to read when they cut into the line below, and my u's and n's can be hard to distinguish lol.... Also, if people want to maybe they could post samples! I would be really curious to have pictures to go with people's descriptions :) 
2	Very messy. I can turn on the neatness if need be, but most of the time I am only writing for myself and I have so many thoughts to get down on paper at the same time, that there is no time to waste being neat :) I can always rewrite or type it if it needs to be presentable!
1	Most people always tell me it's neat, but if I'm trying to keep up with notes for example it gets pretty messy 
1	A mess sometimes I even have trouble reading it .... 
2	Signs an ISFJ girl likes you?	Hi! So I met an ISFJ girl recently, super cute, super smart and also very diligent. \n\ntldr;\nMet isfj girl- confessed- tells me she wants to know me at current level- since then we've been talking everyday and having long phone calls.\n\n- What are signs an ISFJ girls like you?\n- How can you differentiate platonic to romantic vibes?\n***\nIt started out with us following each other on Instagram through mutual friends and she would always like my stuff. Gradually she would comment on my pictures and stories too which kind of got my attention because I never really thought about her often.\n\nI then posted an IG story asking if anyone in her city would want to hang out (we live in different cities) and she was one of the first to respond, I have to add though that we never met before in person so this got me even more intrigued. (Also have to add she has social anxiety?)\n\nFast forward a couple of weeks I asked if she had a boyfriend, found out she recently broke up. Fast forward again a few more weeks, I tell her I want to get to know her more than a friend and I don't expect anything to happen right now. She tells me she's been dating guys after guys since she was young and wants to experience being alone and wants to know me at the "current level", she did add that she didn't want this to be a BS excuse because she said she does like talking to me and that I'm a cool and interesting person so I guess she does like me as a person? Which is totally ok.\n\nFast forward to the present. We've been talking everyday, maybe missing a few days in the past month or two? I've held my feelings back from falling for her because I can still turn it into platonic vibes.\n\nWhat I want to know is, if I am (or seems as if I am) friendzoned why does she talk to me so often and doesn't mind hour long phone calls? I've been wanting to just sit her down (my friends I've confided in have voiced that it's a bad idea and I should just ghost her but she said says too many guys have ghosted her when they didn't get what they wanted from her, which is not me) and tell her that I do like her just to make it clear and that I'd probably want to not message her for a bit so I can get my feelings into platonic mode because I would want to be able to treat her as a friend and not stress her out with my infatuation of her. She's really someone who I would've regretted not knowing whether romantically or platonically in my life. Somehow, before I make the transition into seeing her completely platonically I just want to know if there is no other way? \n\nAlso she has been opening up to me since she says she's not good with being vulnerable or emotional? Which is very sweet and motivating for me :) \n\nThanks ISFJs! Just a note you guys have honestly well at least in my life been the only people that have really invested in me so keep doing you! <3
5	It could be that she is using you for validation.\n\nSay how you feel, in the shortest most direct way possible. Keep it to a few sentences (not an hour-long discussion).\n\nThen recognize that love is a two-way street. If she feels the same about you, she will reciprocate and you two can move forward. Ball is in her court.\n\nOtherwise, cut her off. \n\nYou both deserve to find your mate, but won't get anywhere if energy is spent on the wrong person.
2	Firstly the talking everyday thing means very little. Talking doesn't do much for the isfj. Talk stimulates NFs, it's the domain of the NTs. There is not much substance in conversation with an isfj, keep it light hearted but give her the microphone. They may get into it when they get to vent their concerns about people or their situation, this is probably the only time you actually have to listen. Isfj's are always vulnerable and emotional, you only have to ask the right question.\n\nWhen an isfj likes you they will do things for you, she needs to help you and contribute to you. Being appreciated is HUGE for this type, they need to know that you see them. From my perspective, the biggest thing you can *do* for an isfj is take them out of their comfort zone. Be spontaneous about it. Remember their inferior function is Ne. Contrast whatever her lifestyle is currently, if she's busy, be low key when you're with her, very relaxed. If she's more introverted, bring her out in the sun more and go get dessert. You'll do great if you can "coach" her through new experiences or doing new things, it's mostly a showing support thing. Always look for an opportunity to help, acts of service are big with this type. If she's sick, go see her, bring something for her with you. If she's stressing out, call her, tell her the silver lining, talk about fun stuff. \n\nIn general you can be very relaxed. Drop your agenda, just have fun, have as much of it as you can. The more you invest in each other, the more consistency, well that's basically the foundation of a relationship. This takes time but it has a snowball effect. She'll describe the process as "just seeing". It's actually pretty easy. Isfj's are flexible. For the most part it looks like you are stuck in your own way, declaring your feelings won't work. It's sweet but it won't move things forward. The biggest obstacle here is controlling your emotions, things are nearly impossible when you're more emotional than your isfj\n

3	New personality theory discord	Hey everyone. It seems like most of the discord servers aren't serious anymore. A group of us have gotten together to create a new discord server where you can discuss all aspects of personality theory and in an enjoy environment. We are small and brand new so please join us!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/URJzZqb
3	Dating as an ISFJ	Hi everyone, i'm a newbie in this subreddit and not sure if this is the right place to post this (i was thinking of posting in socialskills but i figured i will get more 'focused' responses here) so mods feel free to delete this post if you think it's inappropriate. Anyways enough of that intro..\n\nI've been single for a long time and i thought maybe i should put myself out there again so i installed a dating app for the first time. Had a few matches but eventually the conversations fizzled out (yep i got ghosted a lot of times) until one day this INTJ guy (it's included in his username, also the reason why i thought of this sub) messaged me and immediately asked for my number. I gave my number thinking it's more convenient and i guess i thought he really wanted to know me.\n\nSo we started texting each other, the usual getting-to-know-you stuff, random topics, and even had long phone conversations. But then one day i was extremely busy at work and i wasn't able to reply to his text (the topic was at a dead end and didn't know how to continue). And he didn't call so i thought he was busy. The following day he texted that i was too busy and was ghosting him. I was surprised by this and replied that i wasn't ghosting him, that sometimes i really don't reply immediately even with friends (true story), and maybe we should start again? He agreed but it was never the same. He would only have one-word replies to my texts and even told me that he doesn't text first if he thought the other person doesn't have time for him. It got to the point that i was running out of things to say, it felt like talking to a wall. And then it turned worse when he finally called again but i missed it. I returned the call but he didn't answer. Apparently he got pissed at me and texted me that i should just text him back when i have the time, that i shouldn't have stopped ghosting him and not apologised but didn't make up for it because i was being insincere. So i acknowledged that my commitment issues were questionable and i didn't make up for it enough. And he replied that knowing it isn't enough is one thing, making up for it is another. I didn't know what to reply on that one so that was the end of the story.\n\n**TL;DR**: Socially awkward ISFJ installs a dating app and meets INTJ guy. We exchange numbers, had several conversations until one time i didn't know how to continue the conversation. Guy thought i ghosted him, tried to talk with him again but apparently it wasn't enough.\n\nSo my question is, how do you deal with someone who come on too strong? I'm not sure if it's just me or my personality but most of the time i really clam up around people who are kind of intimidating. I really struggle with human interaction (i think i mentioned this to him and he just laughed at me jerk).\n\nAlso is it also difficult for you to converse with others? Personally i like listening better unless a topic is really interesting to me but most of the time i still end up listening. How do you practice your conversation skills?\n\nFinally, do you ask the other person their personality type when you date? Which personality types do you get along with in your experience?\n\nSorry about this mess. In hindsight i should've probably ghosted him for real and spared myself from trouble.\n
10	Sounds more like an INTP guy. Ignore him and move on. He sounds emotionally unstable. You dont want to get into something like that.
4	best people to date are people that communicate similarly to how you communicate. that's kind of what "clicking" is all about. and it makes building relationships easier and more fun.
3	As others have mentioned on this thread, this has less to do with personality types and more to do with his insecurities (which are not for you to solve). To answer a few questions:\n\n"how do you deal with someone who come on too strong?"\n\nThere are some cases where we need to reconcile with strong personalities (i.e. family, work settings), but this isn't one of those cases. This is more about you setting your boundaries. You don't need to deal with this person or any manipulative person for that matter.\n\n"Also is it also difficult for you to converse with others?"\n\nYes. Communicating my thoughts (pictures) with words isn't an easy task. I prefer to listen too, or just observe.\n\n"How do you practice your conversation skills?"\n\nI don't think many people practice this skill, it tends to develop through life. One trick is to be interested, and not interesting. That is, ask the person questions about their life. It gets them talking, so you can keep listening if you prefer :) \n\n"Finally, do you ask the other person their personality type when you date?" \n\nI don't think it's fair to ask someone their type on a date, and it could be seen as slightly intrusive. For one, types aren't fully developed until middle age (i.e. 30 and above). Second, there's more to a person than their type, and some people take offense to being categorized given their unique background. Finally, part of the fun is figuring the other person out too. Leave it for a later discussion.\n\n"Which personality types do you get along with in your experience?"\n\nI'm not sure, but I think types that have the same functional stack as me (i.e. they have Si Fe Ti Ne somewhere). 
3	You should never talk to him again. 
2	An INFP could be a good option for you. Similar on many aspects, different in others and you complete each other so well because even though you usually share the same values, your strenghts and weaknesses tend to be opposites so you can help each other out. Both INFP's and ISFJ's aren't quitters when it comes to something or someone they truly love, because both types are highly caring and dedicated to serving and pleasing each other, doing their best to make the relationship grow. And this guy you mention... regardless of his typing, he sounds like a jerk. Don't pay too much attention to it.\n
1	If you have a hard time keeping the conversation going I would say that's probably a deal breaker anyway. It doesn't sound like you clicked anyway. FIDO. There are other fish in the sea.
1	that guy sounds like an insecure jerk.
1	> newbie in this subreddit\n\n*Looks at post history.* But this is your only post...\n\nAnyways, that neediness looks like a red flag to me. It sounds like it would get annoying/frustrating If you have to message the someone everyday. As mentioned by others you're better off moving on.
1	Never go INTJ, unless you're Fi and can withstand INTJ's impatience and ego/anger problems.\n\nAny xxTP type is way better for ISFJs.
9	Does anyone else avoid eye contact?	Especially if you don't know the people you're talking to..
7	I've been doing it so long I don't even notice it anymore. :/ If I'm ever sitting down across from someone and we're talking, I struggle with trying to make eye contact but I overthink it and it's totally unnatural.
7	Yes. Big time.\nAlthough I worked on cruiseships for a while in a very customer focussed role. As a result I can push through and maintain eye contact... not sure if it looks natural or creepy, but I can do it.
4	Only with strangers walking towards me down a hall, but I think that's typical. 
4	I used to avoid eye contact like the plague, but some people see it as a sign of weakness and take advantage of that. So FTS, I will make eye contact with you and hold it from 40 feet away while we pass each other in the hall.
4	My brother (an isfj like me) drives me crazy because he will NOT look at people when he talks. He looks to the floor, the left or the right of the person. Doesn't matter who it is outside of family (except his girlfriend), he won't engage in eye contact except maybe for a brief second.\n\nEdit: His classmates in high school legit thought he was blind when they first met him. This was probably why. \n\nOn the same token, I struggle with making eye contact with people I find intimidating or people I highly respect. I force myself to do it, but as soon as I'm asked a question that requires a thoughtful response, I look to the upper left and squint my eyes to get some relief. I remember having a confrontation with a professor I found intimidating and I maintained eye contact for what felt like an eternity. My heart was pounding so much after that.
3	I use to avoid eye contact. However, since being a physician in training I've had to train myself to look into people's eyes and convey that compassion and altruism. I've kind of learned to do that in my private/personal life. The funny thing is there are a lot of ISFJ in the medical community and some of the outward expressions of care are internal conflicts with ISFJ.
2	So I'll be sitting across the table with someone trying really hard to make a conversation and at the same time trying to avoid any sort of eye contact. Makes things really awkward. \n
2	Look at the point right above their eyes at the brow. It looks like eye contact but you're not as anxious about it 
2	Yes, but I try to maintain eye contact for the most part.\n\nI have to look away to focus on what they are saying if it's complicated in any way, otherwise, I read more into their facial expressions and body language and the words become a sort of fluff. So I've assessed their mood, but haven't heard what they've said, which isn't all that helpful!
2	Yes, this is something I struggle with all the time since I have really strong social anxiety in general. It's something I've been consciously working on over time though, so it's gotten a little easier.
2	Well few years ago I managed to get in relaxed position while maintaining eye contact. I didn't even try to change my eye shyness. Now I can take a deep look into any stranger's eyes around and even scare someone If needed :) It's quite powerful thing. 
1	Even with the people i know.
1	I've taken this test multiple times and each have gotten either this type or the logistician one (isfj more frequently). For the most part I fit inot this category, however one thing I can't relate to is constant timidness. If its an informal or business setting, like one where I might meet someone new, I have no trouble maintaining eye contact or saying a few things. Its afterwards where the initial icebreaker shit is done where they usually realize I'm awkward as fuck.
1	makes me feel uncomfortable yeah i start looking to the side or floor after a couple seconds.
8	Is anyone else the passive person in the group that people like to make fun of?	For me my friends always like to make fun of me because it makes me react a weird way. I never know what to do, I just always try to avoid conflict and end up agreeing with them to try and defuse the situation. Is that normal for ISFJ or am I something else?
12	I don't think that has anything to do with personality type so much as you just needing better friends, honestly. 
3	I kinda know what you mean because I get some shit too in my group but thats because I dont care what they say about me and i know they still respect and love me.
2	If anything I'm the LEAST made fun of and most respected\n\nI still get 'shit' but that's just savage jokes between friends
2	I get made fun of because I am quiet and don't contribute much to conversations when there are 3+ people around. It happens everywhere, with family and friends. Not so much anymore, as I think I have made it clear I am willing to interact, but it still occurs every once in a while. Gotta love how having the attention on you suddenly makes it all the more awkward and proves their point...
5	What type is your significant other? And how does it work	Yeh
10	I'm dating an ESFJ.\nHonestly, it's pretty much perfect.\nHe's extremely observant of me and my emotions, and he really insists on taking care of me, whether I ask for it or not.\n\n\nHe's always making sure I'm fed, happy, warm, comfortable and content. He notices immediately if I'm upset, and starts a conversation about it right away. Which is nice, because I have a hard time bringing it up on my own.\nAny kind of conflict between us had been resolved very quickly, with a calm and civilized conversation. Both of us hate conflict, but we make an effort to have open communication.\n\n\nHe's extremely kind, and very gentle when it comes to my feelings, which is important, because I'm really sensitive. \nHe's the most caring person I've ever met, and he's been extremely encouraging to me. I've never felt so loved and cared for as I have since I've been with him.\n\n\nWe complement each other very well, and we make a great team. I never feel like I'm putting in most of the work, like I have in the past, with other people.\nIt feels very balanced.\n\n\nHe's very affectionate and loving, and he values a lot of the same things as I do. Holidays are a big deal to him, and he's an amazing gift-giver. Every gift he's given me has been very thoughtful and sentimental. I couldn't see myself happier with anybody else. \n\n\nHe also makes me laugh so hard I cry, on a regular basis. He's goofy and hilarious, and he brings out my own playful side.
10	He's an INTJ and oh my goodness was it tough as nails for me to understand why it took FOREVER for him to come around. I loved him for two years before we became boyfriend/girlfriend and it was a grueling process of being hurt and talking about it and trying to DTR.\nBut...\nNow it's wonderful. He had to sort things out on his own time and I'm glad I waited for him. We both wanted to make sure this relationship was going to last so commitment has been there since BEFORE we were official. His love is so genuine, loyal and compassionate. I just marvel at how his brain works. He's a listener, he's a comforter, gentle, selfless... Seriously, he just inspires me every day. I pick up so many INTJ-like nuances from him. And contrary to popular belief, INTJs are very capable of romance, but they're more practical about it.  Romance comes in the form of giving their time, checking in with you, or making sure youre taken care of versus showering you with chocolates and flowers (but he occasionally surprises me with those too!).
6	My SO is an ESTJ, so we share two of the four. In general, our main differences center around connection to others and practicality. They can feel very isolated sometimes if they don't feel they have enough connection with others, while I generally enjoy and appreciate extensive times of solitude. Having solid relationships with those I care about that goes deeper than the superficial is important to me, but I often find it easy to be exhausted by them. While we both like to plan things out, I tend to be much more adaptive and try to understand how different parties feel in a situation, and they tend to try and "optimize" situations more, trying to identify problems and ways things could be better and then making actionable steps to reach that plan.\n\nWe share a lot in common which I really appreciate, but our differences are something I think is really special. When they are getting very emotional or frustrated with something, it is easier for me to listen and try to understand. On the other hand, it's very easy for me to be quite passive and not address things that need to be changed, and they push me to step out of what feels easiest to me. It's really been a wonderful relationship I never would have thought I could ever have, and it still blows my mind sometimes that we're together! I've been learning a lot about myself, and I appreciate their companionship so much. :)
5	He is an ENTP - its a pretty awesome complement to my personality. He enjoys talking about things that intrigue me and I can comment with really well-thought out ideas that keep him interested. He's very hardworking and passionate about his church and his family so my personality is great for aiding in coming alongside those two things. I'm a compassionate helper naturally but it just makes him more in love with me that I take good care for the things he loves. The only time we get even remotely close to arguing is over commonly controversial topics because those are when I become passionately talkative which combats with his debater side. We never actually fight though...more fervently disagree which tends to help us grow and appreciate our differences more. His confidence and love language of words really helps be an encouragement to me in my insecurities.
4	ENFP. Loud, messy, distracted, indecisive.
15	I don't like people who are always smiling. They don't seem trustworthy. Any of you can relate to this?	
5	I know what you mean. They seem like they are faking something or trying to make you trust them. But I once met a girl which was really just smiling because she was always optimistic and happy
6	One of my friends in high school once described me as having an "eternal smile" Really not an act on my part, it makes me genuinely happy to merely see the ones closest to me. \n\nThinking back I've always been inclined to wearing my happy vibes on my sleeve. Only on rare occasions it can be a helpless feeling, if you know what I mean. :D But most of the time not a big deal at all for me.\n\n\nStill not 100% sure about my mbti type though. I keep reading about stuff and it's either isfj or infj. I do realize mistypes between these two are common. So take my account of it with a grain of salt pertaining to isfj'ness.
5	You aren’t alone. I apparently have “resting bi$/! face.” I smile when there is a reason to smile. Or when I’m around someone annoying and I’m being polite wishing I could get away from them. 
4	ISFJ guy here. The expectation that one should be happy all the time may be an American/Western one. You know, the mentality behind the standard answer to "How are you?" being "Good" or "Well" instead of "Normal." In Finland, McDonald's employees were told not to smile while greeting customers because business is a serious activity in Finland and people didn't trust them.\n\nWhen you think about it, a constant temperament, whether artificial happiness or absence of emotion entirely, is disconcerting. It is impossible to get a baseline for predicting behaviour because we sense that a person's true emotions and reactions are hidden from us. It is difficult to trust a person without predictability. They may have ulterior motives, or be a psychopath. You can't tell, and neither is safe, and people like safe.\n\nI don't think it's a categorically ISFJ thing. Though, it might be more prominent to us Sensing ISFJ's.
1	Can you explain what it is like to be Si?	As an ISTP, I would just like to understand some people I know a lil better. \n\nJust curious as to how my Ti differs from Si
4	I assume you mean what it is like to be Si dominant. ISFJs also use Ti, just in the tertiary.\n\nSince it is only the third in order of preference, we use Ti mostly to process our feelings and past events. As I understand from what I've read, a Ti dom will process more than this - they will catalogue and analyze everything, looking for logical inconsistencies. \n\nSi on the other hand is an irrational function, it just takes everything in and does some unconscious cataloguing, based on feelings and previous experiences. Over time, personal traditions and a preference for familiarity are developed. There's no inherent logical system built in (except in a lower degree, when the tertiary Ti kicks in), it's mostly instinctual/unconscious.
3	What is it with avoiding the answer?	I'm an INTJ and something I appreciate very much is a direct answer to a question that begs a specific type of response. I am dating an ISFJ and it seems that when I ask her things that concern me, like guys that hit on her or guys that message or Snapchat her she looks like a dear caught in headlights. From what I've read and heard, ISFJs are supposed to be very loyal and honest. \n\nFrom where I'm standing as an INTJ her lack of coming forward with information that would put me at ease is a form of dishonesty. If there is nothing to be worried about then it should be easy to say it, right? There shouldn't be avoidance behaviors. Can you guys walk me through your thought process to let me know if she's actually being shady by playing coy or if you keep EVERYTHING internalized. I don't think I can handle that, if I feel that I'm right about something, I'll put my neck out there to prove it or learn.
7	[deleted]
4	I'm not sure this has much to do with personality types.  I think cornering a girl overtly like that never works out well, and doesn't look good when you show insecurity by asking those things.  Women communicate different than us and, as much as it can frustrate us men, there's nothing we can do about it.
2	ISFJ guy here. If you are insecure in your relationship, you need to cut it out. A girl can't control who hits on her. She should be able to have friends, even if they are guys. Check yourself first.\n\nMy sister-in-law is an INTJ. Her logical mind is abstract, confounding, and unrelenting. Relationships have not gone well for her. That said, here's the best I have to help you out.\n\nShe is afraid you will assume the worst and cut her off with an explosion; or worse, go after the guy in question. Yes, there will be avoidance behaviors especially if you're all in her face. We hate conflict. It's like popping pimples. We'd rather not do it if we don't have to. Lots of times we're glad we did, but it sucks arguing with someone. If you think you're going to force anything with infallible logic, think again. ISFJ's have their breaking points and their bad side is long and deep.\n\nMy last bit of advice is: ~~Read up on~~  Study your conflict resolution.

2	What do you do when your routine is interrupted?	For example, you partied hard last night and slept through 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM today. Now it is 1:00 AM, your supposed bedtime, but you don't feel sleepy because you slept through the day. What do you do?
2	Is this your current situation?
2	I just try to get back to a regular schedule as soon as possible, because things like that can throw me off for weeks, especially if it's a sleep thing (but I have sleep problems, so that's just personal). \n\nAnyway, I usually just try to work myself back to my regular schedule, like going to bed a half hour earlier each night if it's a big interruption or just at my usual time if it was a one-off thing that didn't affect me too badly. And I'll try to keep up more with other forms of self-care like eating well and exercising to keep myself from feeling like total crap the whole time. 
1	You should stay up. Eventually you'll be able to get back to your normal sleep schedule. 
6	Thoughts about Si, Se, Ni and Ne, context, cross-context, worldview, and possibilities	Thoughts about Si, Se, Ni and Ne, context, cross-context, worldview, and possibilities\n\n* Si and Se deal with real experiences directly.\n* Ni and Ne deal with patterns and connections.\n* Si and Ni are concerned with worldview.\n* Se and Ne are concerned with possibilities.\n\nNi/Se and Si/Ne work together as pairs:\n\n* Ni/Se operate within one context at a time. Se usually focuses on the present context, but Ni can mentally shift the context in space/time so Se can have a look at it.\n* Si/Ne are cross-contextual. So Si builds up insights over time, and Ne uses it as a springboard to find parallels between situations, objects, ideas, anything.\n\nTherefore:\n\n* Ni builds its worldview by looking at patterns and connections within a single context at a time.\n* Si builds its worldview by looking at real experiences across contexts.\n* Se finds possibilities by looking at real experiences in the current context.\n* Ne finds possibilities by looking at patterns and connections across contexts.\n\nAny comments, corrections, elaboration, or relevant anecdotes welcome.\n
4	I have to say I find some of this quite surprising, especially coming from an INFJ. I think a lot of what you say is roughly correct, but not necessarily for the reasons that you think, and there are a couple of things (particularly relating to intuition) that are a bit mixed up.\n\nOne of the reasons that I'm surprised is that connections and patterns are very Ne-centric Idioms to use, and I don't actually think they apply that well to Ni.\n\nA lot of people would use principles when talking about introverted intuition, but I actually prefer rules because principles is sometimes easy to mix up with values which makes people confuse introverted feeling and intuition.\n\nThe reason why patterns doesn't fit introverted intuition very well is that introverted intuition works mainly with novel things-- things that it may have no experience of. An introverted intuit can look at something brand new and make a judgement about it based on its innate properties in contrast to their rules, whereas an extroverted intuit would need to try and relate it to something he already knows.\n\nOne thing about introverted sensing-- I say this all the time and can't stress it enough, while it does relate to the real world, it is reflective and as sich out of date. It works by processing memories and impressions into its traditions, and so is incredibly subjective, and often tradition formation has much more to do with emotion relating to the impressions than anything more objective.
2	Sounds about right? Are you just trying to get your thoughts down to solidify your understanding of those functions? 
6	Si - Fe	\nHello,\n\nCan you give examples of situations in everyday activities when the combination Sí - Fe is very useful and examples when it can create issues?\n\nI'm thinking of common situations like driving to work, buying lunch, doing house chores etc\n
5	I think of Si as taking in the present and comparing it to past experiences and Fe as group harmony. \n\nSo a positive example would be, ISFJ has a slice of cake and enjoys it, then recalls having cake in the office and how much everyone enjoyed it, so to make everyone feel good, ISFJ brings in cake.  \nNegative would be, ISFJ is working on a proposal and recalls the last proposal being submitted late and how stressed and upset everyone in the office was, so ISFJ takes extra time, effort, energy to ensure it is done, so that no one is stressed by it.  I think those are two decent examples.
2	Si-Fe makes us great gift givers. We know people well and remember a lot about them, and we know how to make people happy. Seriously, I win Christmas every single year.\n\nThe biggest negative it ever caused me is its ability to hide things under the rug, things that should be said and dealt with. Si leads us to remember how painful a past experience was, and Fe allows us to smile and pretend that nothing is wrong. I'm willing to bet that a lot of Fe users are actually quite depressed and anxious, even though they put up a brave face to the world. And the source of that anxiety / depression is probably something that happened before that really hurt.
1	These are my two weakest functions, but by observing an ISFJ friend I think it would be the absolute best for family events planning.\n\nNegative would probably be public speaking like in a university assignment about something technical, maybe?
2	INFP looking for advice regarding one of you!	Hey guys, so this is a semi-throwaway account.\n\nSo I'm an INFP guy who is currently completely smitten with an ISFJ girl whom I've known now for about a month and a half. \nIt took all my courage to ask her out on a date which she agreed to! The date went well I think, and I did my best to make her feel comfortable.\nHowever, near the end of the date she revealed that her previous relationship ended badly so she doesn't want to rush into a relationship, since we have just met and she barely knows me.\n\nAmong our common group of "friends/acquaintances" we are both relatively new, so neither of us know the rest of the group too well. She says she wants to get to know everyone better, including me. \n\nAs an INFP, I strongly lean with my intuition and gut, and tend to fall for people fast and hard. I feel so comfortable and at ease around her.\n\nAfter reading about ISFJ's it seems like she is being cautious since she doesn't know me well enough yet.\nI don't want to rush her, and I hope that over time I can show her that I'm trustworthy. But I guess my question to you guys is: \n\nShould I maintain my feelings for her and continue with the hope that once she gets to know me more and trusts me, that she will start to like me? Or do you think\nshe's already made her decision and was just being polite?  \n\nShe did text me the day after the date saying that she appreciated me being straightforward with my feelings, and me not being awkward about it helped her be more honest, and that she hopes to get to know me better over time.
5	Sounds like you're on the right track. Keep on communicating, hanging out and talking, be patient and consistently there for her, and overtime she'll start to warm up more and more to you, if I know anything. That, or either of you could decide you're ultimately not compatible in the end after all that :P but yep, just be patient and supportive, initiate conversation if you want to, etc.!
2	I think she was being honest. I think she's open to giving you a chance and getting to know you but she's guarded cause of how the last relationship ended. And she doesn't want to rebound into anything! Take it slow, initiate conversations, texts and hangouts but don't over do it or be pushy(like texting her constantly especially if she doesn't reply, etc). Just be yourself and she'll warm up to you. 
1	This is classic ISFJ behavior and it would really mean a lot to her if you could give her the space she needs and continue to show her that you are worthy of her trust. I don't think she was just being polite because ISFJ people would not want to lead others on if there was indeed no chance for a relationship. Just be patient & open with her. Good luck!
1	Wow I was in the exact spot as you at the beginning of May. Best of luck friend. \n\nAs others have stated, I think patience is best, although it can be difficult for us INFP's\n
1	Patience is definitely the way to go in this situation. If she wasn't int he least bit interested in you, she wouldn't have gone one a date with you in the first place. 
5	Timed Tests (Academics):	As an ISFJ, does anyone else struggle to meet time limits on tests at school? Not for lack of trying, or being distracted, but simply that there is not enough time to answer all the problems and answer them well/at least comfortably.\n\n(/r/iamverysmart) I always get told I'm smart, and I do have straight A's, but I chalk it up to being driven to prepare myself for anything that I might encounter on a piece of paper--no more, no less. This opinion of mine is also reinforced by things such as the fact that I scored fairly low on the ACT (<24), meanwhile others can breeze through tests such as these and achieve a perfect score, or at least a more rewarding one. \n\nI was wondering what causes people to function higher on the ACT, if anyone else--particularly fellow ISFJ's--endure a similar plight against timed testing in general, and what other comments, experiences, questions, etc. you guys might have regarding anything in this discussion.\n\nThanks :)
6	I can't give you input on the ACT, but I can say that YES I struggle with timed tests. I mean I'm not saying that I never met the time limits, but I would definitely be one of the last students in the room before handing a test in (in college). \n\nThis is because of the following reasons for me:\n\n1. I am a perfectionist/high achiever. I feel my work is a reflection of me. Therefore, I must feel good about my work to feel good about myself. This means double or triple checking stuff I KNOW is correct.\n\n2. I don't work well under immense pressure. When the clock is ticking dangerously low, my brain starts to shut down into panic mode. I work efficiently at the beginning of a test and as people leave or there's less than 5 mins left, I start to worry I won't finish in time.\n\n3. My comprehension sometimes craps out on me. If there are verbal instructions, I may need to hear them 2 or 3 times before I retain it. Same with visuals. This causes me to panic when gears are switched too quickly for me. In most cases, ill be trying to hear verbal directions and my brain starts jumping ahead and distracting me from listening. Its quite frustrating.\n\nIve been told I'm smart too, but honestly I've just been a good student with a fear of failure.
1	I definitely struggled with the ACT. I took it once and didn't finish most sections. The SAT went better for me and I had just enough time for each section. I definitely agree that we are slower test takers. In my case, I like to make sure my answer is correct before I let myself move on. For me, this was only a problem in high school (and not often). Now that I'm in college, I'm allotted much more time for each test which helps significantly 
1	I've never done well with standardized tests that have timed sections. I'm far more concerned with finishing all the questions in the time given instead of the quality of my answers. It was the most egregious with timed essays, and I'm pretty sure that's why I scored so low on the Writing section of the SAT when writing is one of my stronger suits. I can't churn out a coherent essay within 25 minutes. Not that it matters anymore, since colleges hardly looked at the writing section of the SAT and it's been done away with since I took it. I never took the ACT, so I can't comment, but I suspect it would've been the same. 
5	Adventure seeking ISFJ's, are you out there?	I keep reading about ISFJ's being boring homebodies that like routine. I'm an ISFJ but in many aspects I can't relate. Yes at times I'm really good at getting shit done around my moderately clean apartment and sometimes I procrastinate or I'm to busy to finish chores (like folding laundry). But I am very social. Most people mistype me, including my family, thinking I'm extroverted. I need socialization and will seek it out. If I need to socialize but my friends are working or busy with family stuff I'll go to bars alone, music festivals alone, traveled internationally solo. I'm not great at getting groups of people motivated to do something with me but I do occasionally. And if I want to try something new or go somewhere I will go alone if I can't get anyone to come. And sometimes I'd rather go alone cause I don't want to go with someone who doesn't enjoy the activity or will complain if they don't like trying something new.\nI have a lot of hobbies and interests. I've had a hard time in LA cause people my age just want to go to the bars all the time and I want to go backpacking, or to museums, or scuba diving or talk about books, media, business, stocks, etc. In fact, socially I feel more isolated cause I feel like I have to have multiple groups of friends for my different interests and I wish I could just have a "go to" group of friends for all the different things I enjoy. For example I have a ton of friends that will meet me at the bars, a small group that I go backpacking/ hiking with, a few people I scuba dive with, and ONE friend that I can meet at a quiet bar and have business/ stock/ media/ philosophical discussion with (He's an INFJ if your wondering) <wish there was more. \nSome of this social problem is the city I live in. Or at least thats what I gather from some of my close friends I share this with. \n\nBu I'm just wondering if other ISFJ's can relate. Is there any other ISFJs who love adventure and feel like we ISFJs falsely get a co-dependence title?\n
2	I can relate to this very well.\n\nI also have a lot of hobbies and I love to get to do them with a group f friends. Often though I don't find people who like the same stuff with the same intensity as I do. I changed quite a lot in recent years to do more of it on my own. Went to a motocross track on my own, went to a BMX event alone and watched, I go to the cinema alone quite often and I like to go outside to explore city and nature around.\n\nHowever, for me it always about finding familiarity in the stuff I do that makes me at ease even if each "adventure" is different. The first time doing these things was kind of scary but afterwards it became incredibly easy and enjoyable. I only have to do it a few times to proof to me that I can do it and it will be great.\n\nFor example I am also at ease with going on dates with girls. Did it a few times, recognised the pleasure in it and that I will be fine no matter the outcome. On the other hand going somewhere to meet new guy friends seems surprisingly scary to me right now.\n\nI also totally agree with your wish of having groups of friends to do all the stuff together. I went mountain biking with a group of friends recently and it was the best. Actually I wished you were in my vicinity and I would totally join you for most of the stuff. :D\n\n-----\n\nIn general for ISFJs I think they can enjoy most of the stuff you describe. They just need to break out of the loop to trying something for the first time. I think I read something about some loop between the functions that make us crave the comfort zone (which can be much beyond our couch at home^^) and the rational that it worked for us so far and we should keep doing what we do. They talk about this in [this forum](http://personalitycafe.com/isfj-forum-nurturers/133481-isfj-si-ti-loop.html). Takes effort to break out of this but it can be done.
1	i don't love it, i prefer to stay at home, but i also don't want to live a life where i haven't tried a bunch of stuff. so i end up doing a bunch of stuff like you.\n\nin the last two months i went sky diving for the 2nd time, kayaking, drove on a 5 hour drive to a place where i hiked see the eclipse, went on a week long vacation to orlando, attended a indie game convention, went on another 5 hour drive to a wedding in a forest-y no phone connectivity place, sparred at boxing for the first time, also i help run a role playing game every other week, and i do regular weight training 3-4 days a week, and have a full time job.\n\njust got back from the wedding yesterday. next weekend is a role playing game. the weekend after i'm going to start taking weekly martial arts class (looking into krav maga or defence lab). the weekend after that i'm going to go on another long drive to a lights festival where people light up lanterns and release them into the sky. tonight i'm buying tickets to atlanta georgia for november to visit a friend.\n\ni bring close friends with me on these trips. whoever can make it goes. every friend i have is different and they each and do the thing with me that works for them. in my head i mentally know which one is good for what. which is my philosophical friends, which is my fight friends, adventure friends, outdoor friends, city foodie friends, etc.\n\nalso, i'm exhausted.

8	Career suggestions for an isfj???	Hello,\n\nI recently took the myers briggs test and found that Im an ISFJ, and it seems to fit me well. Ive looked on different websites for careers suited for isfjs, but was wondering if anyone here could give me advice on my situation.\n\nI graduated from college within the past year with a general public health degree. I currently work as a health educator for a hospital, and am looking for a new position better suited for my personality. I chose this line of work because learning about health care had always interested me, and I wasn't sure which direction I wanted to go in. I like being able to help patients, but Im too much of an introvert for this position, and dont like the constant overlap with social work. I have full health benefits through my work, and cant really afford to leave my job to go back to school. Im looking for something I can go back to school for part time, or even earn a certification, so I can enter a different field. I like working in health care and want to use my bachelors degree, but I dont enjoy working with patients and definitely need my alone time during the day. Any fellow isfjs have any suggestions or insights? Anything would be appreciated. 
5	I'm an ISFJ and I work as a preschool teacher currently and love it. After finishing my education I'll be a school psychologist to help the little ones be the best they can be! There are a lot of jobs you have the opportunity to help others, you just have to mix it with what you're passionate about. 
6	I've heard nursing, and social worker as great careers. I'm an ISFJ but I love to work laborious jobs and making my boss/supervisors happy. I think  the more you sweat/push yourself the more quantifiable your results in a career are but that's purely subjective at best. Hope this helped :) :) 
6	Health occupation teachers in middle and high school are in great demand.  As an ISFJ, I just recharge during planning.  It's a great career.  The county I teach in have a hard time filling positions.
1	I'm in Human Resources and it fits me like a glove. You would think the conflict would get to me, and it does, sometimes, but all in all, I like understanding people's issues and finding a win/win. Of course you have to find a company that values win/win too but it's been very professionally satisfying.
1	Accounting - I get to be by myself a lot of the time and do my work, and get to stay out of the potential "conflict" situations that the front desk deals with. I find the work very satisfying.
16	Key characteristics of being an ISFJ, in my opinion	These are the major aspects of my personality that differentiate me from other personality types. I suspect strongly that these things are probably true of most ISTJs? Let me know if you relate...\n\n- Without some frame of reference, I am lost. I accept, to some degree, that the first time I do something, I might do it horribly wrong. But once I do it a few times, I get much more comfortable, and the best work I do is with anything I've had exposure to. So math has been a good subject for me: teach a bit, then do a hundred math problems to get it down. If it was "read this book and write an essay on your own thoughts", I'd be lost.\n\n- Change is just always hard. And it's good for people, sure, but wow, it is incredibly hard for me. I recently got an eye floater and I feel like my world is ending, even though I read that 50% of people over age 70 have them, and they seem fine with it. (Granted, I am only 32) Having to adapt to any new health issue is always devastating at the beginning. And honestly I still can't get over my memories of pre-health problems and pine for those times.\n\n- Having Fe as my lead feeling function, I end up just not getting Fi. I have never understood how someone can see an event happen and immediately have a very specific reaction to it / opinion of it. Like say the government passes a new bill, and some folks immediately start protesting. Maybe there are some good parts to it? There's always a lot of grey...\n\n- Another key thing about Fe is that if I say something that grinds someone's gears in any way, I immediately back down, even if I feel like I might be right. I remember devastating losses in political debates between a liberal and then later a conservative in the same week! Shouldn't I have agreed with one of them? lol....\n\n- Our superpower, IMO, is knowing how to help others. Fe being our dominant extroverted function drives us to do this, and Si helps us figure out what works best. I admit I used to be awful at helping others at first since I had no clue how to. Now that I know techniques, I want to make a life of it. I want it so much that I've gone back to school to become a nurse. Which so far has been good, but I'm really struggling with mental and this one physical problem with my eye which I didn't have to worry about in my first college go-round. It's tough to venture out into the new.\n\n- And a few more things with that...I'm still single, and I have really beaten myself up for that. You don't need to offer any words of advice...I've heard em all, and my Si helps me remember it too, lol. It just kills me to be in a family where my brothers got married straight out of college and had normal lives, and I've been the one that had to try and convince myself to be happy with different, nontraditional circumstances. Hopefully you fellow ISFJs realize how tall of an order that is.\n\nAnyway. That's all for now....
6	This describes me 100%. Thanks for sharing!
4	I can relate to everything you said, but the last bullet point really stuck out to me - something I definitely needed to hear at the moment, so thank you. :)
1	I can relate to almost everything, but so far I feel like I take change pretty well. Maybe I just haven't experienced a huge change yet, though :)
1	I never realise that an ISFJ would beat themselves up for being single! \n\nAn ISFJ friend of mine often lament on the fact that she's still single, but I always assumed it was because she likes the idea of romance/wants to settle down because it is a major life milestones ... Is there any advice that you've had in the past that you felt was particularly helpful to you regarding this?
11	ISFJs, what personality types are your closest friends?	Hi fellow ISFJs,\n\nBefore discovering Myers Briggs, I always sort of contemplated why I could bond quite easily with some people while others it was more difficult/forced. I blamed myself thinking I just had lousy social skills, but after finding out my personality type and the types of my closest friends, I made a connection.\n\nThe people I instantly bonded with are INFJ (3 of them) and INFP (2). These same people are ones I remain close to and conversation comes quite naturally and it's easy to open up.\nHowever, I know 2 ESFPs and even though I bonded with them, I find I put up a wall around how I truly feel.\n\nI was wondering if any of you have shared similar experiences as I have in regards to who you bond with? What personality types do you feel you make an instant connection to? I'd love to hear your input!
4	My beloved best friend is an ENFP, and I've been really close with an INFP and an INTJ in the past, but those ended badly. I'm not sure of the types of my other friends, but I think a lot of introverts mostly? I like (mature) extroverted feelers best though, because I find them very welcoming and easy to talk to. I struggle a lot with friendship and conversation since the aforementioned friendships which ended badly, so it's very soothing to be around someone who's capable of leading the discussion. 
3	one is INTP and the other is INTJ. I have another close friend who ended up being the extroverted version of me which seemed to fit us perfectly so she's ESFJ. \n\nMy friends that are E's I can't spend as much time with just because they have different definitions of what spending time together involves, and it feels more taxing as opposed to my introverted friends.
3	My husband is a Esfj. It works out really well because we have a lot in common and he enjoys talking to strangers so I don't have to. Hahaha 
2	My wife is an ISFJ and her close friend was an INFP, but had difficulty eventually with her and are no longer close. She felt judged by my wife and kept telling her how she compared herself to her. My wife felt like her friend didn't really like her even though she spent a lot of time trying to help her and spend time with her. \n\nHer other two close people are her cousin and her grandma, both ESFPs. But she struggles with understanding how irresponsible they are. But they're fun every once and a while. \n\nI am an INFJ, and were great together! Tons of fun, lots to talk about, we love planning budgets and trips. Playing games EVERY ONCE AND A WHILE. Watching shows together and taking care of people and kids. We do however have totally different outlooks on life. But it keeps me grounded, and I help her take chances and do something she normally wouldn't. \n\nI find it really funny that most of you on this thread find the same types so nice to be around. Especially since a lot of websites say that we're not super good matches. 
2	Both my two best friends and my girlfriend are INFPs, my next closest friend is an ENFP, and a guy I dated before I met my girlfriend was an ENFP. Apparently I get on really well with xNFPs, it's become a thing lmao. 
1	My very best friends are an INFJ and an INFP.\nI would say I'm closest to the INFJ, though.
1	An ISTP and INTJ
1	ESTP boyfriend, \n1x ESFJ, 3x ISFJ,\n2x INFJ, 1x INTJ, 
1	I'll use two posts I've made in the past:\n\n>My best friend's an ESFJ. We just... _understand_ each other. We think the same way, have the same opinions, same mindsets, same morals, same values, same politics... And he's frequently told me I'm the only person he can completely trust. Ditto for him; we find it easy to just be ourselves together and understand each other's thinking. We may act differently and have different demeanors, but the ways we think are one and the same. Overall, the most loyal and understanding person I know.\n\n>My second closest friend is an INFP. He's really chill (even quieter than I am, oftentimes) and is very receptive to listen to me talk about anything (composing, typology, depression, politics... Anything, even stuff most people wouldn't care about) and he'll find what I have to say interesting. He doesn't write things too often, but when he does, he always comes to me first to help look it over and proofread it, and the writing's always very personal and meaningful. We find each other's sense of humor hilarious (mine dry and sardonic, his done more in actions than in words). We've both dealt with mental illness in the past and tend to agree wholeheartedly on emotional things and support/trust each other on emotional issues. All around, a great friend and someone I'm glad I can just hang around with.\n\nAround extroverts I tend to let them lead conversations, but around other introverts I tend to initiate.
1	Esfj and infj 
1	I have 3 close friends that are all INFJs, and then some ENFPs, INFPs, and an INTP. I've also been pretty close with some ENFJs but I've recently come to realize that I don't get along with them all that well...
1	SJs and NTs, nearly always introverts. *shrug*
1	the only person i consider a friend is a wonderful isfp. i also have a good friend/colleague who is infj.
10	ISFJs do you relate to this thing?	"The ISFJ poorly tolerates monotony. He/she needs alternatives to boring everyday life, a possibility to make a choice, even though finding himself always in it. Greatly enjoys himself if he finds a way out of dead-end, seemingly hopeless situations. Interested in unusual and extraordinary people who have many ideas and make bold proposals. Boring, mundane people strain him; he tries to avoid their company. He is tolerant of eccentrics and inventors, all those people who are "not of this world". He views them like children, looks after them graciously forgiving their antics.\n\nThe ISFJ receives and understands chaotic information poorly. It makes him confused, throws him off track, may even spoil his mood. The ISFJ likes it when someone makes a connections between specific events and general concepts. His self-esteem improves from becoming aware of his own usefulness, that without him it won't do. Likes to correspond to the place or role allotted to him. Activates when he is given a clear goal and explained the trajectory of action. Ways of achieving it he will find himself. Doesn't need "bare" facts, instructions, explanations. The main thing for him is to like the system, that it would evoke a positive response in him. Then he becomes collected and organized."

3	Can confirm. Where did you find this explanation? I feel like I don't relate to a lot of the information out there on ISFJs, but I relate to this.
2	A lot of it is relatable, yes. I don't hate monotonous tasks, but I am easily bored and tend to flit from one project to another. I like people who talk and have interesting things to say (partially because it comforts me to be around other people who are sort of off-beat and not necessarily into really mainstream stuff), but if I think that they're being a dick about their eccentricities, I'll hate them way more than the average person. And I don't think of them as children lol, I like people who I have a genuine, equal connection with and who allow me to explore lots of ideas and angles freely without feeling judged or constrained. \n\n1000% yes on loving to feel useful, know my goals and my path, and having info presented in a clear way. I do like having things explained to me to some extent because it's hard for me to start from scratch with no frame of reference, but you don't have to go through every single little step usually, I'll find the pattern myself after the first few times. I do love the satisfaction of figuring out a way through a tricky situation, and I think the "specific situations->general concepts" thing kind of relates to my love of interdisciplinary studies. \n\nSo, for the most part yes, with a few caveats, I think this is pretty accurate for me. 
2	The stuff about monotony is entirely relatable. While eccentrics and inventors take energy to be around, I think my fellow ISFJ's and I actually seek out these people to add the variety we crave in life and relationship. I'm not so sure "graciously forgiving their antics," is quite the way to put it. We grant that their antics are normal to them and generally appreciate those antics as long as they do not negatively affect us or the people we care about. \n\nChaotic information is exhausting because it is tedious to sort through. I love myself a trend. I love being useful/valuable because I desperately want to be accepted and that is how I figure I'll get there. Clear goals and direction are always nice. To me, it is not as important to "like the system" as it is to understand it and know how to work within it. Structure is nice, but it should have room to develop as it is more fully understood. The more it is understood, the better I like it.
4	ISFJ Discussion Topic 11: Experiences with ENTJs	Aka one of our complete opposites, both in terms of functions and being extroverted as opposed to introverted\n\nENTJs can be harsh and honest with their words but ultimatley they mean well (especially if they're 'healthy ones')\n\nThe only real experience I have with one is an online friend I voice chat with often. We have similar views on things so we get along pretty well and I think he actually respects ISFJ types well.
2	ENTJ chiming in.  \n\nAn ISFJ female was highly interested in me and I was on the cusp of being interested so we did a couple friendly coffee gatherings amongst hanging out in a larger group.  In the end I walked away.  \n\nWhy?\n\n1) Wouldn't be 100% honest with me\n2) Played games to figure out my feelings\n3) Shit tested me (don't shit test ENTJs)\n4) Would ask my friends what topics to talk to me about (just ask me, no?)\n5) Would act disingenuously uninterested to get a reaction\n6) Would try to get me jealous by talking up interests of other men \n\nThat's my experience.  In the end there's nothing I could relate to with her.  Her feelings dominated her thoughts, and logic took the last backseat in a minivan.\n\nI think we, ENTJs and ISFJs, could be a match but we're dominating and brutal with our opinions and thoughts.  We never mean harm or disrespect.  Time is precious don't waste it on useless niceties.  Be honest with us and you'll have us at hello.  
1	Build a wall, and make the ISTJs pay for it
4	Do you feel exhausted after leading people?	So yeah I would like to ask you dear ISFJs if you feel exhausted after you´ve lead people. Because of my job i sometimes have to lead other coworkers and I like it and and enjoy it but most of the time I feel very exhausted after that. Also if any of you have a tip against this problem or how to get better at leading people as ISFJ I would be very thankful.
3	Absolutely! Though I haven't been a leading people in a job, I've certainly been a leader in academic situations. However, I don't think this is a leading people problem--I think it's just an introvert problem. There's nothing wrong with feeling exhausted after putting your energy into leading people in your environment. Introverts just need alone time to recharge and even though helping and leading others is an ISFJ's core trait, it is simultaneously rewarding and tiring. My advice to you is that, if possible, you spend time by yourself in a healthy way before these instances where you're going to lead people. Read a book, watch a movie, listen to music, etc. Even if it's just for 30 mins, quiet alone time is a must for introverts. I understand that you can't exactly get "alone time" at a job, but even maybe setting up a schedule every night before bed would help. I'm not sure what your life is like, but if you're not having alone time, schedule it in :)\nAlso, if you feel overwhelmed/tired WHILE leading people, and perhaps someone is asking questions that require lengthy discussion, ask them politely if you could get back to them about it. Sometimes I put questions and messages on hold when someone needs my attention because I just don't have the energy to deal with it right away.
4	Yes, even in online chats
4	I used to run a clan in an online game and although I was a kind and fair leader, I hated the exhausting feeling that came with it. People would rely on me at different times and we'd run events that I would have to be online for, lots of social interaction. \n\nAt work I'm not in a leadership role but give helpful tips and basic orders to new staff, which can make me feel tense at times.
2	I work as a receptionist and I thoroughly love helping my coworkers and customers over the phone, but yeah as an isfj I'm drained every night when I go home. I recoup by listening to meditative tracks on the drive home and sitting down for about an hour to do a little bit of creative writing.   I also have good days and bad days. On bad days I'm not necessarily mean but I don't go out of my way to be extra helpful. I also tend to drink a lot more green tea :)
5	Can't sleep, mind racing... ISFJ or Anxiety, or both?	Hello everyone. I've really enjoyed the posts and comments on here. I'm experiencing something relatively new for me.\nI've had trouble sleeping. \nWhen I first go to bed I will fall asleep for about 30-45 min but then I begin to dream (think?) about all the things I ever did or ever could do that we're wrong, awkward, or made people feel bad, etc. Sometimes the feelings are abstract, like just the feeling in your chest when you screwed up and you know it.\nThe feeling jolts me out of a sleep and I can't fall back asleep for hours. Once I do fall back asleep, it's the same pattern.\nAfter about 3 cycles, the night it over and I have to go to work.\nI am wondering if this is something to do with my ISFJ, or anxiety (which I have been diagnosed with, by my doctor several years ago).\nThanks in advance!
3	I dunno, I would be inclined to say it's probably more the anxiety, but I could see how the ISFJ-ness could come into it too. For an anxiety-prone ISFJ, SiFe can really make thinking about the past pretty hellish, and at night your mind doesn't have much else to do unless you actively give it something else to chew on. \n\nI'm an ISFJ with sleep problems too, so solidarity on that lol. I dunno if it would help you, but I try to either meditate and focus on finding a positive feeling, or just write fanfiction in my head when I'm trying to fall asleep. Either way keeps me from spiraling off into negative feelings about the past, and helps me fall asleep a little easier. Honestly though, you may also want to see a doctor about trying a mild sleep aid or something. 
2	what you're going through sounds like what this video is talking about:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VJI0ecVO6c
2	[deleted]
2	I fall sleep very quickly. I've only had problems during finals in college, so I'll chalk that up to anxiety. 
4	help	i recently broke up and my Si and Fe are absolutely destroying me. My Si keeps on bringing back all of the bad times and my Fe is only making me feel worse for all the bad things that happened. School is about to start and i don't want to go in feeling like crap. any suggestions, much appreciated
3	the only thing i know what helps is to distract yourself spend time with friends and try to get something to do maybe
2	This is not type specific, but go on dates with new people! It doesn't have to be serious or long term, just go on dates. Look for people on the internet or whatever you like. Doing that will force you to think about new possibilities, and you'll start having better perspective on your ex.
2	Unfortunately it will feel like crap for awhile. Give it time and ride it out. http://breakuprecoveryguide.com
1	Find something else to do, think about, and care about for now. Something positive to do with your life, time, and mind. And something to achieve. And wait as time will move on and change will happen, and you will heal. Keep up the hope.\n\nThis video helped me and a few friends with break ups.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/9mbp0DugfCA
1	I went through a breakup recently too, it was pretty hard, my advice is to find something else to concentrate and spend your time on, whether its the gym, a small project, work or just going out with friends, it will all help distract you and concentrate on the important things. Remember this is just a blip in your life, theres more to life than this. Try not to wonder 'what if', or blame yourself for mistakes, think of the positive outcomes of the relationship ending now. And surround yourself with people who you can talk to about this, they'll be your confidence boost. Hope this helps :) 
8	So I am pretty sure I am ISFJ...experiences?	In the past I have received the results INFP and INTJ/P. I went through all of the types and ISFJ feels right. I dunno 100 percent though. Here are some random insights into who I am. \n\nI am very withdrawn. I am married, have been with husband for 12 years, married for two. I am very passionate and romantic person and work very hard on my relationship. Husband is equally introverted but we are just as in love as we were then and its beautiful.\n\n I have had very few friends in life. I have trouble trusting people though and have been used in the past.  I rarely show my emotions. Inside I am constantly battling self doubt. People say I am very kind.  I dont have it in me to be mean even when wronged. I get hurt very easily but don't let it show. I come off as cold and emotionless and I believe I have social anxiety. Despite this I am happy with my life. I am hardworking and ambitious but deep down I feel really stupid. I suck at conversations and people have described me as a robot cos I am not quick witted and struggle to find the words to say. Part of this is that my mind is always racing and I cant seem to slow it down. \n\nDoes anyone else have similar experiences? I think my inability to handle social situatuons has hindered me from getting jobs I want and things like that. I plan on going into teaching because I want to help others but I am scared of the interaction aspect. I think it is something I could excel in.
2	A lot of this sounds like me and my mom and we're both ISFJs, so I would say it's well within the realm of possibility that you are, too. \n\nMy recommendation will always be to do some research on cognitive functions if you really wanna be sure, though. The mbti-notes tumblr has some good, quality guides on figuring out your type via the cognitive functions and explaining cognitive function theory, although they're a bit of a heavy read sometimes. Or you could probably just google it, but I can't vouch for the quality of any of the sources you'll find. There's a lot of bullshit out there about mbti lol.
2	Ok I have been slowly learning about functions. Thanks a ton for the insight :)
1	Are you me lol? I used to think that I was an INTP, but that sub said I was too emotional. What is your husband's mbti type? I just broke up with an ENFJ, because I was too hermit like.
4	ISFJ Discussion Topic 10: Experiences with ISTPs	This is another type I dont have much experience with IRL\n\nI have an idea of how they are with looking up types and some fictional characters.
2	We are similar in a lot of ways. We can enjoy doing activities together.  \n\nBut, we hate rules, while you guys love them. We don't care about feelings, and it's all that you care about. So, talks can be boring unless it's about something to do. 
1	I'm an ISTP(f) and my crush is an ISFJ(m).\nI'm a "go with the flow" kind of person and I hang out with different sets of friends and he is more of the serious perfectionist type. Sometimes, his friends tease him as "boring" and "not fun". I don't think he is boring, he just takes a lot of things personally. \n\nWe are pretty similar in terms of principles, some of our characteristics, etc. but we are actually awkward if we are left alone together.
6	At which point of your life did you know what you want?	Alright no idea whats the best way to explain my situation but i will try my best. I am 20 years old and until like 6 month ago i exactly knew what i was going to work. It was all planed and i was ok with to go this way. But then in the last months or year its hard to tell I fell like I have overcome my puperty and can finally think straight. And with this clear mind my behaivor and my goals changed and I have no idea what i want to work. The only thing i know is that i want to work/help people. I would thankfull if you people could tell if you have experienced something familiar. And what helped you in this situation.
4	Don't worry, you are still young! Also you can join your interests with previous thoughts maybe? For example at the very moment (I am 22 for a couple of days) I would like to code mobile apps that could help people in various ways. :) \n\nTry out different things, don't attach too much to any, and see what fits best for you. Being 20 years old you still have many possibilities waiting to be discovered. You may change your profession at 30s, who knows what the life brings for you :D \nI keep my fingers crossed for finding something that makes you happy and fulfilled!\n
2	I'm 22 and a college dropout and only just now figured out that I think I wanna be an editor lol. It's pretty normal to take a while into your 20s or 30s to figure out what you really wanna do as a career I think, or even to never figure it out at all. But I realized that's what I think I wanna do by doing it for free, helping out friends with their writing and whatnot. 
4	ISFJ Men - reveal yourselves!	What kind of person are you? \nAre you more of a Sir Anthony Hopkins kind of ISFJ man or a Michael Cera variety or perhaps Bruce Willis or Kanye West (hahaaa!) represent you well? None of the above?
13	Michael Cera in the streets, Anthony Hopkins in the sheets.
9	Hate to say it but I see a lot of Morty in me sometimes. Including new season Morty.
6	I'd like to think I'm more of a Chris Hemsworth. My sincerity and sensitivity make me attractive to some people and a target to others. 
3	I'd say I'm more Michael Cera from the first three seasons of arrested development.
2	Sir Anthony Hopkins in my mind. Bruce Willis when I'm confident. Kanye when I'm too confident. Micheal Cera any other time.
2	i tell people i'm a weird mix of Dwight from the office, abed from community, and iroh from avatar the last air bender.
1	I've been told that I'm more Ted Mosby.
5	ISFJ Discussion Topic 9: Experiences with INFPs	INFPs are an interesting bunch from the ones I experiences. The nice ones are REALLY nice, sometimes nicer than I'll ever be.\n\nHowever there are some that are very very passionate about what they believe in. Sometimes I feel like the way the argue or say things in a surprisingly condescending or negative tone unknowingly causes unnecessary stress or they just don't care. 
6	The woman I have a crush on is an INFP. She definitely has some very strong beliefs, but they line up with mine, so I'm all for them. She's very kind and I feel very natural around her. I don't have to feel like I'm walking on eggshells or have to watch what I say. \n\nShe straight up asked me how I felt about her, which really surprised me, but it was great. She's a no-nonsense kind of person and I find that refreshing. I'm often too reserved and afraid to say what I really want to say. With her, I know she doesn't like hiding my thoughts, so I say what's on my mind and she accepts it. We're not together because we'd prefer to wait until we're ready, but I could see her and I being able to strengthen one another. She claims she's too blunt, so maybe I could help her with that, while I need to speak my mind more, and she can help me. 
3	They'll do the condescending/negative thing when Fi triggered and when they can't communicate any more honestly than inf Te passive-aggressiveness.\n\nMost of them don't seem usually in ego mode like that though
2	Infp I know have been nice, shy, and idealogically hopeful people. I drop my shields down around them easily and they have each expanded on my ability to hope and be more compassionate with others.
5	How fast are you able to tell if someone is a person that you want to have something to do with?	yeah this question is kinda strange but i want to know if someone else is able to tell very fast what kind of person someone is?\n\nBecause whenever i met someone new i dont need much time to tell that this is a good or bad person. Its just i look at them and i know i want to have something to do with them or not.
4	You don't even speak to them first? 
4	Mm, maybe like a week or two of consistent contact? Some people it's obvious right off the bat (people who are loudly bigoted or openly mean/cranky, that kind of thing), but a lot of the time I think I tend to assume the best of people or take their "polite social face" at face value and then realize as they relax more that they're not someone I want to be around. 
1	I do this too but I've learned to not judge people to quickly some can surprise you , but usually my first though of them is right , I look at how they act on certain situations,  the way the interact with people . 
1	I can tell if someone has the right motives or not, or whether I need to be cautious of them. Couldn't tell you why that is though, they give me an odd feeling is all :P But as for getting to know people and wanting to spend time with them, it can take me weeks to really see who they are and become motivated to keep in contact with them, if I was trying to date someone for example.
6	ISFJ Discussion Topic 8: Experiences with ESFJs	Aka our extroverted counterparts.\n\nSurprisingly despite how common these types supposedly are I don't have much experience with them.\n\nThat said I feel like they could be good friends and partners since we essentially have an understanding of how the other works, one's just more reserved than the other.
3	I've been dating an ESFJ for a year.\nPrior to him, I didn't have very many positive experiences with ESFJs.\nThe ones I knew where very emotionally immature, bossy and spoiled.\n\nMy ESFJ is lovely, though.\nHe's extremely kind, he's funny and goofy, and he brings me out of my shell a lot.\nHe's always trying to take care of me, which is oddly pleasant, as I'm usually the one trying to take care of everybody else and not receiving much reciprocation.\n\n\nHe shares a lot of the same values as me, and we're very similar in a lot of ways. He makes me laugh harder than anybody else can, and he brings out my silly side, which is pretty rare.\nI feel very very comfortable around him, and our communication is great.\n\n\nHe's pretty sensitive and gentle when it comes to my feelings, so for the most part, it's rare that he ever hurts my feelings. However, if he does, he notices immediately, and wants to talk about it. He's very good at communicating about emotions, whereas it's a bit of a struggle for me, so it's been really helpful for me to have someone who's naturally open with their feelings, and able to listen patiently while I try to share mine.\n\n\nHe's very observant, sometimes to the point where it makes me uncomfortable. He's acutely aware of my emotional state, even if I may want to hide it. I'm oversensitive, and sometimes if I get offended, it's better for me to slap a smile on my face until I can be alone to process my feelings. He's the only person that doesn't fly with, because he notices immediately if I'm upset, whereas with most people, they can't tell.\n\n\nOverall, he's an incredibly warm, kind person, and he has a wonderful sense of humor. I can relate to him easily, and he honestly brings out the best in me. He's one of the few people I feel almost entirely comfortable being myself around, and I'm ashamed that I thought poorly of ESFJs before I met him.
1	My best friend's an ESFJ. We just... _understand_ each other. We think the same way, have the same opinions, same mindsets, same morals, same values, same politics... And he's frequently told me I'm the only person he can completely trust. Ditto for him; we find it easy to just be ourselves together and understand each other's thinking.
1	My best friend used to be ESFJ. We used to get along really well, almost like we were the same person. But, then we had [several] fights and are longer friends even though we are still civil to each other if we happen to see each other in public. 
1	My best friend is an ESFJ! We understand each other a lot and I think she is the kindest person I have ever met! I just love her! Moreover my very good male friend that I have always been seeing as a great person turned out to be ESFJ. My grandmother is one too and I enjoy spending time with her. I also have a great contact with two ISFJs that I adore as they are the cutest at times!\n\nAccording to me these two types are very likely to be good friends, as the level of understanding is huge between them -> us.\n
6	She made me a better person	Back when I still had had a shot with an ISFJ girl I work with just being around her made me a better person. I was way nicer, less abrasive, than I normally am due to always being in a good mood when I was around her. She always made me smile. I was more helpful. I cared, more, about how I came off to people. I put extra care into thinking about what I was saying or going back to explain something that came out wrong. I miss what we had. Then I had to go and fuck everything up. Seriously regret going to her house that night. Or at the very least I regret not engaging when she was coming on to me
1	Just curious what type are you
1	HELLO! It is I, an ENTP!	I'm researching how the different MBTI types like to be asked out/approached romantically for an article, and would like (semi) serious answers. So, if someone was interested in you, whether it be a friend or a stranger in a bar, how would you appreciate someone asking you out in a romantic fashion?\nThank you!
10	My dream encounter is a person of unspecified gender approaches me and says "HELLO! It is I, an ENTP!" I then swoon and we get married in Vegas by Elvis (the real one) the very next day.
7	Being that we ISFJs are very connected with our feelings, it would be nice to have someone else also connected with theirs. Simply just expressing how much the person liked me and told me whatever was on their mind would be enough for me 
6	I am a Male ISFJ so yeah if someone would tell me they like me or being around me. And ask if i would like to do something with them togehter i would like it very much.\n
2	Somehow bump into a new person or someone I kind of know at somewhere. We get talking and we share similar feelings about stuff and also we are clearly interested in each other's beliefs, ideas, and perspectives. Then she tells me she wants to see me again on an actual official date.
1	Honestly, I would feel uncomfortable. That being said, I have been in a four year relationship with an ENTP. The beginning of was just very slow.
1	I shoulder-tapped my ex gf ISFJ in a supermarket, then stuck around to talk long enough to get contact info. Just acted chill, no over-eagerness, no intimidating energy, just enough interest. The surprise Ne randomness was done in an exciting yet comfortable way.\n\n(Don't IRL approach in all caps.)
2	Does she like me? I'm not sure	Hey there ISFJ's! Looking to find out how you would flirt with someone you like or how you would show you like them? I think this girl I work with at the pet store likes me but I can't be entirely sure. If you could put your gender too that would be helpful (maybe guys and girls flirt differently even between the same type?) 
2	Talk to them like anyone else, and gauge interest.  Takes practice and embarrassing yourself a few times to get more comfortable.  Enjoy the journey and don't put too much thought into the outcome of the interaction.\n\nMale ISFJ here, on my way to becoming more extroverted.
1	Topic made a year ago where people share their experiences\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/4m3s6s/how_does_an_isfj_flirt/\n
4	How to give good advice?	I'm reposting my own question from another subreddit.\n\nI really want to be that person that people can come to and vent, but when someone actually starts to vent to me, I don't know what to say. I usually cop out with an "I'm sorry", "Is there anything I can do to help", "It's okay", etc., cheap answers like those, but I really want to be able to fully support someone when they need it.
5	What I do is that (this will sound cliche, but it works) I put myself in the other person's shoes as I listen to them, think about the best decision I would make if I were them, and then relay that to the other person. We ISFJs are very good at empathizing and decision-making, so use those skills!\n\nAlso, try not to ask, "Is there anything I can do to help?" That's a yes/no question, so most people will say "no" so as to not "bother" us. Instead, ask, "*What* can I do to help?" That implies that we *are* going to help them, and it's a lot more direct.\n\nOften, though, just venting is enough for people, even without getting advice about the situation. :)
1	Do you know how it feels like ? Empathizing is really powerful. It can be your way to decide if you can provide support or not, too. \n\nThere's nothing to be ashamed of to bail out and writing nothing because you never experienced anything comparable.
1	I don't think about what I can say to fix their problem.  I imagine I'm them and let them know how I would feel in their position.  My responses tend to be like "That's frustrating I'd be pretty bummed...".  Even if I think I know what they can do to make it better, I keep that to myself unless directly asked for advice.\n\nI realized most of the time I vent I just want someone to listen and understand how I feel.  When people respond to that with all of the things that could be done I find it makes it worse.  Almost like the fact that a solution exists invalidates my feeling bad about whatever has got me down/mad.
1	i find good advice comes from experience and also from empathy.\n\nthe more you experience and learn and observe and analyze, the more you can know about and help others with. the quality of your advice goes up with experience. and you will see more options available for you and for the other person to take.\n\nthe better you are at empathy, the easier it is to put yourself in someone else's position and mindset. and that allows you to see what the person wants and needs better but also understand what can be blocking them from their perspective. and also empathy helps us understand how to communicate better. knowing a person's mindset allows us to know how to customize/tailor messages that is easier to unpack and understand by specific people.\n\nexpand experience and empathy, use them to increase your area of expertise, getting into people's perspectives, and become better at communication, and you're set.
6	ISFJ Discussion Topic 7: Experiences with INTPs	I personally have more experience with online user INTPs I talk a bunch with than INTPs I know in real life (in fact do I know any?)\n\nWhen they embraced more of their lower functions like Si and Fe I tend to like them more but when they're just on a Ti/Ne brigade they're either too meme-y or too overly negative about things
6	My husband is an INTP. One of the greatest compliments he ever gave me was in saying that being with me was like being by himself.  Meaning that he reenergizes with me while most social interactions drain him and he needs to take a break from people. \n\nWe have common interests in books and movies but also interests that don't overlap at all. We have similar values. I've read some stuff that says ISFJ/INTP is not a good pair, but we both feel we compliment each other. I accept who he is and do not judge his changing obsessions. He appreciates my compassion and that I "make a home". I keep the house clean and organized, pay all the bills, and make plans or take care of logistics. I've learned that he doesn't even think to offer to help but will take care of anything I ask him to without complaint. He'll take the lead on things that require more research, like investing. \n\nHe's not very emotionally expressive, but I know when he shares something that it's only with me and that's a huge compliment. Because he is a rational thinker I view him as conventionally intelligent. He can launch into an argument for either side and maintain it without any preparation. He thinks it's fun to argue for the challenge of it while I shy away from arguments. He has a good memory for things he has learned. I'm stronger at spacial relationships, wordplays, and creativity. 
2	I'm actually the same: I only know some INTPs online, and none in real life!\n\nI have to work with an INTP since we're both judges for a composition competition. He can be dense and stubborn, and, without having tapped into Si or Fe, he doesn't have a sense for things a judge would need (e.g. judging music fairly because it's the right thing to do rather than basing scores on more arbitrary things, or not knowing when the penalties are too harsh). In general, he can be quite negative when working or judging music. Still, he's quite ambitious with his own compositions and is very good at finding errors in other people's music (Ti?), which I really admire.
2	My best friend is an INTP. We share similar interests and can talk for hours about them. He's a fun and mischievous person, I love his sense of humour. On the other hand, sometimes I feel like I'm boring him - I can notice when he's zoning out during our conversations. And sometimes he can hurt my feelings unknowingly. I'm not sure if it's just him, but most of the times I can't rely at all on the plans I make with him.
2	I love INTPs. Like ENTPs they are infinitely interesting to me and a handful of my close friends are INTPs or very similar. We're pretty different, but they're great. Also they seem to love going on rants. 
1	I'm not negative I'm realistic.
5	Survey for ISFJs about Movies	Hello everyone! I do hope I am not being redundant with this post. Since this is my first time on this subreddit, I wouldn't know haha.\n\nI am an ENFP writer and I am hoping to have some assistance with a project that I may end up writing about, depending on my results. Recently, I was pondering whether or not individuals would have similar movie preferences as those who identify with the same Myers-Briggs personality type, and I decided to look into it further. If you all are interested in contributing, please list your top 3-5 favorite films, and you can even add a short description elaborating on your decision (this is not required). There are no wrong answers to this, just have fun with it!\n\nThank you in advance. I look forward to reading everyone's comments :) 
3	1. Into The Wild\n\n\n2. Goodfellas\n\n\n3. Forrest Gump\n\n\n4. Dunkirk\n\n\n5. Walk The Line
2	Hi, I am sort of a lurker on this subreddit. Had an interest in mbti for years, but had trouble identifying correct type but I feel ISFJ clicks. Haha anyway here are some movies I enjoy:\n\nThe Grand Budapest Hotel\n\nHowl's Moving Castle\n\nSilver Linings Playbook\n\nThe Big Lebowski\n\nForrest Gump
1	1: American History X\n2: The Shawshank Redemption\n3: Requiem for a Dream\n4: Schindlers List\n5: Undisputed 2/3\n\nNumber 1-4 are movies which really changed my view on some topics and left me speechless on the credits\n\nNumber 5 are just really good fighting movies
1	pan's labyrinth: beautiful and haunting film about rebellion and disobedience. i cried at the end.\n\nspanglish: movie where i get to see a bunch of characters feel authentic and like real people and how their conflicts build up. also i have a soft spot for cooking and movies about what it means to be a parent.\n\ndark knight: blew my mind on what a movie could be like.  it was intense. and i love how strongly you can get the characters' motivations and how they conflict. movie left me breathless.\n\nchef: movie about cooking, father/son relationship, trying to find passion and direction. it's everything i love in a movie.\n\ncatch me if you can: kid growing up dealing with problems in relationship with parents. love the characters and their interesting way their motivations conflict.
1	1. Powder\n2. The Dark Knight\n3. Wonder Woman \n4. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\n5. V for Vendetta\n\nWas somewhat difficult to come up with five. I have a lot of famous movies that I've not seen. There's a lot of movies I love. To me though, I would describe all of these as perfect movies. Rogue One is the only Star Wars universe movie that I've really loved. It also happens to be the first movie I saw in theaters with my fiance, but it would make this last even with that aspect aside.\n\nEdit: Changed #5 and updated description\n\n
1	Looking at my top 3, it seems I have a thing for the Heroic archetype movies. In no particular order:\n\nPacific Rim\n\nKingdom of Heaven\n\nSerenity \n\nI don't watch a whole lot of movies, but when people ask those are the three I usually default to
1	1.Star Wars Ep 3 Revenge of the Sith\n2.Star Wars Ep 1 Phantom MEnace\n3.Dragon Ball Z Resurrection of F\n4.Dragon Ball Z Battle of Gods\n5.Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone\n\nAs you can tell I'm very attached to a few series and have odd taste
1	Hello there. I must say I'm a skeptic when it comes to this. I think there's no consistent correlation between MBTI and taste in movies. You must also keep in mind you are on reddit, so what you'll get on this survey is the taste of several ISFJ redditors (not indicative of ISFJ population in general). \n\nMy prediction is that you won't get significantly different movies than the ones reddit posts in "what's the best movie ever" threads. I can already see that pattern in the few replies you've got so far (nothing wrong with those movies, just pointing it out). To throw this off a bit, here's my list:\n\n- The White Ribbon (Haneke)\n- Ordet (Dreyer)\n- Inherent Vice (Anderson)\n- Werckmeister Harmonies (Tarr)\n- Amarcord (Fellini)\n\nThis is rather random, I can't precisely say which are my absolute top five - if you ask me in a month, I'd probably say other movies (while not feeling less enthusiastic about this list here). You could probably relate some of these to ISFJ stereotypes: Amarcord deals with recalling childhood memories, Inherent Vice has undertones of nostalgia and difficulty to let go and move on, Ordet is about faith and love of the others (not a believer myself, but it's such an emotionally powerful film), and all of them have beautiful cinematography. But I feel this would be a wrong approach.\n
1	In no particular order:\n\n-Hot Fuzz\n\n-The Legend of 1900\n\n-The Legend of the Drunken Master (not the same as Drunken Master) \n\n-Hero \n\n-The Fifth Element 
1	My top two favorite films are My Neighbor Totoro and the Nightmare before Christmas - the first because it's artistic, peaceful, and calming (I find most of Studio Ghibli's films to be like this), and the Nightmare Before Christmas because it's strange and charming. \n\nI'm not sure if listing shows counts or not, but I'll go ahead and cite Zankyou no Terror/Terror in Resonance, because the plot moves along well, it's dark, and it's emotional. I also love Durarara!! because you get to know the characters and their situations, and see how everything and everyone connects. 
1	It's difficult to choose but let's see (no specific order of preference):\n\n- the hateful eight. \n\nI like everything that tarantino does, usually because his plots are really intricate to the point of absurd. Love the dialogues and the detail he has photographically speaking. I enjoyed this movie a lot because almost all the film takes place in a little cabin, where all the actors appears frequently in scene and therefore they seem to be acting continuously, like it happens in a theater play. \n\n- The handmaiden\n\nKorean film from park chan wook director. I enjoyed everything, the plot, the acting, the photography. It's a story of love and revenge with an unexpected development. Sometimes subtle, sometimes transgressive. I also enjoyed the symbolism. \n\n- La vita e bella\n\nWonderful movie of a (hilarious) father that protects his son from the reality of world war II. Sad/tender/warm. Impossible not to cry :'(\n\n\n- Wild tales \n\nA compilation of stories where people show the worst of them out of frustration and anger. I like that I can empathize with their feelings in that situation, but the ways they decide to act is priceless. \n\n- Mad max (new one) \n\nTwo words: Tom Hardy.\n\n\n\n\n
1	The shawshank redemption\nThe aviator\nCatch me if you can 
1	1. Hacksaw Ridge, Whiplash (can't choose so both)\n2. Good Will Hunting\n3. - 5. Gladiator, Empire of the Sun, The Brotherhood of War\n
5	Are you really always smiling?	Dear ISFJs i am asking this because i am not always running around and smiling at people when i am with my friends or family yes. But when i am for example on the way to work i just have a neutral/sad expression on my face. So yeah i am just like this or is not so uncommon? 
11	No, I don't think that's uncommon at all. I typically try to be happy and uplifting with my family and friends, but if I'm being honest, I don't really care much when I'm around anyone else. Probably most of the time when I'm not with friends or family I look like I'm unhappy or sad. I see no reason to put on a fake smile for people I don't care about. 
5	No, I either have resting bitch face or resting sad face (where apparently I always look like I'm about to cry.)
4	If anything I think ISFJs when not around loved ones have more "neutral" expressions. Not particuarly happy or sad, kinda hard to read.
5	When I'm lost inside my head - which is more often than I like to admit - I usually have "resting sad face", as someone called it. Sometimes strangers would approach me and ask if I'm ok and try to comfort me.\n\nWhen I'm engaged in casual conversation with someone, I tend to smile a lot - I'm doing it also with strangers, not just family and close friends.
3	I smile so rarely that smiling is a workout for my weak and unused cheek muscles.
2	I smile a lot, but not in situations like walking to my university. I have a neutral face, sometimes I might even look angry. There are times that I smile on my way but that's caused by something, like some sort of music/podcast, some memory or a situation I hear on my way.\n\nOnce I've heard a guy I know said "You would have to punch her in the face, so she finally stops smiling/laughing" about me. \nThat's how it is with people, not at times I am alone. \nThat's how people see ISFJs maybe, but that's not strange you are not smiling 24/7, don't worry :D
2	ENFP with ISFJ - am I reading into things?	So there is this good guy friend of mine that I'm pretty interested in, and for every thing that makes me think he might be interested, too, there is another that makes me think he really couldn't care less. For example, I am frequently his confidant- he trusts me with some pretty heavy stuff that he hasn't told anyone else and always kind of seems shocked at himself for telling me. I don't know whether to take this as a good sign or not, partly because I do have a knack for getting people to open up. He takes things I say very seriously, for example, there was one time where in a moment of vulnerability told him that his teasing of me (which he tells me he just gets the urge to do with me) was getting to be too much and asked him if it was him being passive aggressive about something he wasn't confronting me about, an accusation that he took kind of hard, I think, because he very abruptly stopped teasing me, and will still occasionally bring that conversation up (it was about 1.5 years ago) and quote me on things I said during it (and generally remembers things I say long after I've said them), and tells me how guilty he felt after I told him my feelings were hurt. He even jokingly inquired once if it was because 'I was in love with him' that I took his teasing to heart. He will initiate things with me, but only when I bump into him - usually when we hang out it is a spontaneous suggestion on his part, whenever he sees me, but has only ever planned something with me once (concert), as opposed to me actually planning to spend time with him. He compliments my appearance every so often but we are friends so that isn't really crazy. Oh, and he did once randomly show me a picture of himself shirtless, with no prompting on my end, because he was showing me a different picture on his phone and scrolled passed it, but then for some reason felt he had something to prove and made a big show of showing me the pic. Honestly, I guess I just want to know what kind of signs to look out for in an ISFJ guy. I considered telling him how I felt but didn't want to try if there was nothing there, esp since we've been friends for this long. 
2	Don't do it lol, ISFJs will never stop quoting from years ago
1	Eh, people are complicated. You should just tell him that you like him and see how he responds. It shouldn't be too terrible if you've been friends for a while already. 
7	ISFJ Discussion Topic 6: Experiences with ISTJs	My main job/major is a Computer Science so I was surrounded by a good amount of ISTJs\n\nI've never been particularly close with an ISTJ (in person) but my general experience with ISTJs has either\n\n* Chill and down to earth. Fairly honest but every so once in a while kinda harsh with words. Competent and confident in what they do\n* A slight more extreme where brutal honesty is their default behavior. They know what needs to be done and prefer to work alone while doing so but they'll communicate when they need to. 
5	Lol this one is easy because my sister is an ISTJ. \n\nI'd say her most glaring quality is her ability to call it as it is... Pretty much brutal honesty. Everything is logical with her, her overconfidence in getting things done ON HER OWN, is very very noticeable. Think "Angela" from the tv show The Office. \n\nShe does think a lot, which she mentions is her downfall. She has a very big issue discussing feelings or even discussing her own problems so it festers. She works even harder when she is stressed out. \n\nMy sister is a nurse, and for an ISFJ like myself, when I start to worry about really small (in hindsight) and unfounded health issues (like a sore muscle that's been sore for a few days), she'd say things like, "Are you breathing? Are you alive? Then no, it's not an emergency."\n\nWhen I need solid advice, when I am really down in the dumps and in the grip, my sister is pretty much my saving grace. She combats my intense softness with her intense hardness. She knows just the right words to say to counteract whatever I am feeling. She makes sense of things I can't make sense of. So I love that balance I get with her. As harsh as her words are when she's trying to get me out of whatever bad feeling I have, you can't help but really think that whatever she is saying is very logical and reasonable and so contrary to how an ISFJ like myself would view it. She doesn't do it in a commanding way like shouting orders at me to "feel this, feel that!" but rather, she asks me questions, but then answers them anyway because she knows my answers will not make any sense to her as my answers are almost always based on emotions, not logic or reason.
1	I'm trying to write one right now and I'm not sure how well it's going tbh
1	Just discovered i am ISFJ. What to do now?	So yeah i found out my personality is ISFJ and now i dont know what to do with this information.
8	Nothin, really. Use it to identify weaknesses you may have and work on correcting them. 
1	One time I got ISFJ on a test. Don't know how the hell that happened because I couldn't be any more different from most ISFJs (I am an ENTP after all). But yeah, you should go on YouTube and find some ISFJ videos so you can relate to them and whatever. 
1	I am great at planning! ha. good luck. every isfj I know is a pretty decent human being. 
5	ISFJ, ISFP, or something else?	I can’t tell if I’m a Si-Fe or Fi-Se user. I always get ISFJ or ISFP as the majority answer depending on the questionnaire I fill out. When taking cognitive function tests, I usually get Si, Fi, Fe, Se in that order. The only thing I'm sure of is that I'm enneagram 9. I’d love if I could get help on confirming my type!\n\n**Warning:** I don’t have that great of an understanding about the functions, so most of these may probably be stereotypes, but here’s my best shot. \n\n---\n\n**Si:**\n\n- I enjoy recalling past memories and experiences\n\n- My memory for the past is better than most people I know\n\n- I hate taking risks even if they’re small\n\n- I dislike big changes such as new jobs and new schools, and take longer to adapt to these changes than necessary \n\n- I like knowing what to expect / the details of things (ex: who’s going to be at a hangout, when is it, where are we going, how long are we staying for, what are we doing?)\n\n- I feel much more comfortable if I have a sense of familiarity. Being unfamiliar with a place or situation makes me uncomfortable\n\n- I like stability and security\n\n- I use what I know and have experienced in the past when working on present and future things \n\n**Why I second-guess Si:** I'm mostly only present-oriented. I would say I'm at least 85% focused on the present. Also although Si has nothing to do with anxiety, most Si users I know are prone to worrying while I'm mostly always nonchalant and complacent.\n\n**Se:**\n\n- I’m very present-oriented; I hardly think about the future, and the only time I think of the past is to recall memories when being reminded of them \n\n- I love designer items and wish to own many expensive, high-end things. I’m also a big spender who mostly spends money on appearance, and I dress for beauty not comfort\n\n- I like trying new food as long as I know what the food is\n\n- I just want to live in the moment and be happy even though I don’t actually do much \n\n- When seeing something, I’m more likely to describe what the thing looks/sounds/etc like than to associate it with a feeling or memory from the past \n\n- I almost never worry about anything and am more likely to just think, “well I can’t do anything about it, so I might as well just wait” or “when the time comes, it’ll come” and stuff like that\n\n- I find the arts appealing; music, film making, photography, drawing, writing, etc. I’m also pretty creative myself, but not all that talented with the arts other than writing poetry and stories \n\n- I’m usually one of the first to notice something in my surroundings \n\n**Why I second-guess Se:** I don’t take interest in doing physical things like hiking, partying, raving, playing sports, and more. I also don't adapt/adjust to change that quickly unless I actually want the change, which isn't often. \n\n**Fi:**\n\n- When someone says or does something, my first reaction is to think about my opinion or my feelings (in my mind)\n\n- I dislike and am uncomfortable with expressing most of my feelings, so I keep them to myself \n\n- I care about morals and ethics; I dislike when people do unethical things like lie on a resume (or lie about anything), steal someone’s belongings because they forgot it somewhere, take credit for someone else’s work, and etc\n\n- I don’t really care about norms and dislike some, such as shaking hands with people you meet, saying “bless you” when people sneeze, and more \n\n- I stick to my values most of the time; I could agree to a hangout then not want to go anymore, but still go because I already agreed to it and I value keeping my word\n\n- I’m pretty reserved and private with most people, and I take a long time to get comfortable with someone or to consider them “close”. I’ve had the same friends since I was in elementary, but still don’t feel close to them even though they feel close to me\n\n- I don’t take criticism well and can take defense to what someone says (misreading it as something rude when it wasn’t meant to be), but I don’t express any of this to them\n \n- I look at many things as right/wrong or good/bad\n\n- I hate when people try too hard to be something they aren’t, like when they change their entire image or personality to fit in with the cool kids \n\n**Why I second-guess Fi:** I don’t place high importance on myself being authentic, individualistic, or having a clear identity. I also don't talk about myself that much even though I enjoy talking about things in my interest.\n\n**Fe:**\n\n- I prefer to fit in with the crowd as opposed to stand out and be unique\n\n- I follow a lot of beauty trends\n\n- I’m accommodating and like to maintain harmony to avoid conflict. I have never gotten into conflict with a friend before\n\n- I kind of care what people think about me, but mostly just to the point of avoiding people hating me\n\n- A lot of my values are society’s values (ex: be respectful, polite, ethical)\n\n- I’m extremely agreeable on the outside even though I don’t actually agree on the inside. I’d pretend to agree with my friends about something I actually disagree with because I want to avoid getting into an argument with them and because it’s just easier for myself to agree than to express my disagreement just for them to disagree, which will make me mad on the inside\n\n- I don’t really have a sense of self; I have a hard time answering “who are you?” whenever asked\n\n- Many people find me warm, friendly, and animated in my facial expressions and body language/hand gestures \n\n- I’m a pushover and easily taken advantage of. I let people get what they want all the time because I have trouble speaking up. Friends have said that I’m “too nice”.\n\n**Why I second-guess Fe:** I don’t care about other people’s feelings and I don’t help people to make them happy unless I really like them. The reason why I sugarcoat, pretend to agree, and help people is to avoid conflict, so I can maintain harmony. However, I don’t care about group harmony; the entire group could be fighting, but as long as I’m not involved in the fight, I don’t care because I still feel at peace.\n\n---\n\nI have a questionnaire I recently filled out here in case anyone wants to look back on it. People there told me I'm probably ISFP, but on the mbti community I'm still getting a lot of ISFP and/or ISFJ answers. [Here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/6rxmph/could_i_be_an_isfj/)\n\nI'm also willing to answer some questions if it could better help me find my type. Thanks!
1	After a quick read, I'd say Si-Fe. Some of the Fi and Se traits you wrote aren't necesarily Se-Fi things. I can go into more details, but I really need to sleep right now. Will return tomorrow.
8	Sup dudes, ISTP(f) dating an ISFJ(m)	I think I broke him. He's an enneagram 6 so a little different from your typical ISFJ enneagram 2 types, I believe. \n\nAnyways, I kind of used to handle him like glass because... I was being considerate of his sensitivities, as I can read it on his face pretty well, he seemed often easily .. not hurt I would say but... kind of.. like he doesn't take jokes well, if I call him out for something(always as a joke) he gets .. defensive..almost.. on guard? E.g., we were racing to the elevator and he got there first but I pushed past him inside just as the doors opened and I yelled "HA, you lost to a girl, does that make you feel emasculated?" (clearly joking since I lost) And he was just like, "What? No..." and he got that stubborn look on his face and it got awkward and I tried to brush it off and stuck my tongue out at him or something but damn was that an awkward elevator ride up. \n\nSO, I was treading carefully but then one day he sat me down and told me that he would prefer that I speak my mind so the next time something came up, I did. It was about sex. I tried to fix it. The sex pretty much sucked. So I told him how I felt about it (which is basically that I didn't like it and that I wanted to work on it) AND NOW HE WON'T LOOK ME IN THE EYE, he flinches when I touch him, and idk, he gets this stubborn look on his face, and it's been going on for awhile now and I'm about to dip out of this relationship real soon but....... I mean.. why don't I just give it a shot and ask y'all... how the flying fuck do I fix it? I didn't mean to offend his pride, he's extremely physically attractive so I don't know what he has to be insecure about, if it is insecurity... \n\nBut the more he avoids me physically, the more he seems to approach me conversationally, especially over text, which is kind of hard because I'm not a great texter but I'm really making an effort here because I know I dip out of relationships too quickly and he's a pretty great dude.. \n\nAnyways... I don't know whats going on in his mind, maybe you guys will. I know I'm extremely upfront but it's never personal, more informative, I'm not really good at softening words, but I don't mean it to hurt or offend so maybe theres a way I can say things without it putting him on guard? \n\nMaybe I'm just not compatible with him or with this type in general... idk, I don't seem to come across many of you often. 
4	I'm a enneagram 9 (I'd say 6 and 9 are more common with ISFJs than 2 from my experience)\n\nISFJs can take anything to heart really hard, even little jokes that have negative part to it (something I'm trying to work on).\n\nIn a way we're weird in that we want people to be honest/real with us (Si, Ti) but as I said we take criticism to heart.\n\nThere could be the Si/Fe 'traditionalism' mindset of you making the joke of a girl beating him in something that triggered him but I don't think I would mind (but I like to think I'm pretty mentally strong and would get over stuff like that)\n\nFunnily enough like you said while we are sensitive we can be super stubborn because I think we want to fulfill a need especially to people we love.\n\nWhile you were honest with him which he does appreciate, I'm going to guess he's feeling REALLY guilty at the moment (I know the feel!) because of the sex thing (and maybe little things like the emasculating joke?) he feels like he's not satisfying you enough as a significant other.\n\nHowever, ssince he seems to be a conflict-averse person (like me) thats why he's kinda keeping his distance since he's aware that he's disappointing you in those regards (even if you appreicate him for other things)\n\nI really think the only advice is you're gonna have to force him to sit down and have a serious talk about it.\n\nMy brother who also had an ISFJ girlfriend had similar issues when they got into fights and ultimatley making sure they were on the right page is important.\n\nI think it's good when talking to him seriously about this is to find a balance between softening words and honesty when needed
3	i know what would work for me but.... it might just be me. \n\nif i was feeling like 1) i suck at doing something i consider important for someone i feel like i have to please and 2) i am scared of conflict, which i'm normally not, but if i was.\n\na way for the other person to "fix me" would be for the other person to go H.A.M on the thing i'm avoiding. if it's sex then if the other person shows me that they want sex with me in an extremely aggressive way, i'd feel like i'd better do something about it and get better. \n\nand though in a perfect world, i'd work together with that person to try to get better, i'd want some direction and positive reaction or encouragement when i get them right. maybe even commands. just take the pressure off of me and my probable lack of experience and tell me what i need to do to make you happy.\n\nagain, this might just be me though. i'm a bit of a sub. not sure if this is applicable to all isfj guys. i'm only suggesting it, maybe, because he seems to want to please you but doesn't seem to know what to do about it. sounds like he needs direction and is scared or ashamed to ask.
2	I have an ISTP friend - we get along well, as we have common nerdy interests. Sometimes he makes jokes which I find inappropriate. I get hurt/stung for a short while, then I remember he probably doesn't mean it. If it was a closer relationship, these would probably hurt more.\n\nYou should be probably more careful with this kind of mean jokes. If you slip one, assess his reaction - if his mood changes like you describe, you should maybe apologize and reassure him you were just kidding. Don't get angry with him or start questioning like "why are you so sensitive?? omg! I can't believe this". I would even avoid trying to start a long serious conversation over a small episode like this - if the ISFJ is overwhelmed with emotions, he needs time to process them. If you put pressure on him during this, he will bottle up even more. Just comfort him and help him get over it and then you can have a discussion about it at a later, calmer time.\n\nEmotions are emotions - as an ISFJ I can't really control them, I feel hurt and the realization of being hurt over a silly thing hurts even more.\n\nOk, so this is just general advice. It seems you are in a more troubled place in your relationship. Still, despite his physical avoidance, he still seems to be open to conversation, so maybe you can still have a talk over it. I can understand him being more open over text - if he's emotionally troubled he finds it easier to communicate this way. Thing is, you have to be patient and more diplomatic. I too would be very hurt about the sex thing and it would cloud my judgement - if someone would pressure me or judge me for being so sensitive, it would make it even worse.
1	Well, using emasculation as a joke is rarely a good idea. =P\n\nIf I'm in a good mood, I would have tried to overbid you with something cruder, but chances are I would wonder where this come form.\n\nNothing of that is about MBTI. It's about intimacy. Maybe you both lost that for some weird reason. Try to talk it back. If he do is broken like a crystal vase past over by a road roller, then fuck all this shit. Nobody but him can fix that kind of thing.
0	Do ISFJs have a single good quality ?	
22	Yes. Actually we have 47 good qualities if you must know. We also have 16 bad and 8,293 gray qualities.
9	I noticed youve posted this clickbait title on multiple subreddits over a few months
4	No, of course not. We're just the scourge of the earth and are a detriment to society. /s
5	Empathy, and willingness to lend a helping hand 
8	Yes ? Not only a single, even, and even only as ISFJs, not counting their individual unique qualities.\n\nI mean, I can grasp that being their polar opposite. How shameful is it that you can't ?\n\nWhy the loaded nearly rhetorical question ?\n\n
5	INTJ dating an ISFJ and trust.	So I'm dating this girl(ISFJ) and my first impression was that she was calm and reserved and didn't let much people in. But every time I get suspicious about something it turns out my suspicion was right. It's usually about guys who like her snapchatting her. Or some guys texting her at odd hours, 2am-6am. And when I call her out on it she says it's nothing and then when I ask her if they have any kind of history it turns out that they either have confessed their love to her or were in a small relationship type thing. She insists she wants to be with me and wants us to be long term but I can't trust her or take what she says seriously when every time I dig, I find new things that are unsettling. I open up to her about any possible concern she may have but doesn't reciprocate. She's very sensitive and almost started crying when I asked her if she wanted to be in a relationship. I don't know what the hell is going through her head. Hoping you all could clarify for this analytical INTJ.
10	My best guess would be she likes the attention and had trouble admitting it or letting it go. She doesn't want to seem shitty so she tries to hide it, but keeps doing the shitty thing because it's socially rewarding. She can talk to who she wants I guess, but if you've expressed that it makes you uncomfortable and she's not respecting that, on top of being so dodgy about the behavior? I think you should probably be carefully evaluating what you're getting out of the relationship and how long you're willing to put up with this type of behavior for it. 
3	Those are red flags for any personality. She's A) doing stuff that you're not comfortable with, and B) Not being upfront about it. I'd bounce.
2	/u/lemontongues hit it on the head. sounds like she has some negative habits/social emotional issues in her she finds uncomfortable to deal with and is avoiding. and also avoiding/denying any conflict that those things cause with you.
2	Also, chances are, as an INTJ, you're a lot like me, and want to know where the relationship is at the moment so you can adjust your priorities as needed. \n\nThis gathering of intelligence is important to us, but it can come off as pushy.  If an ISFJ is trying to avoid something, then bringing it up is the best way to make them more uncomfortable.
-4	Sounds like she's being female.  Don't get attached to someone who hasn't given you a reason to trust them.  You're giving out your commitment too easily, and it's turning her off.
4	ISFJ Discussion Topic 5: Experiences with ENFJs	My brother is an ENFJ and we've had a pretty close relationship for a long time. Despite me being the older brother, I never tried to do the whole older brother dominance thing. I tried to have an equal relationship (we're 1.5 years apart) and make things as fair as possible and he always respected that.\n\nWe even moved out together for the first time for a little over a year to get used to independence (we both lived with parents for a long time) and it was fun to learn together. \n\nIt's an interesting dynamic he was a lot better at long term planning and socializing with others and I was better at the smaller things. \n\nFor example, he set up ideas for convienent watching of shows we like, shared account for paying paying bills, new stuff to cook, doing research on proper insurances, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, I tended to drive more since I had a hybrid (and he likes driving even less than me), I set up the shows and schedule/queue to watch, Im a lot more naturally good with directions, there's a few foods I was better than cooking than him so he trusted me with those, and I'm a lot better at managing money than him.\n\nHe's a lot more of a natural with people so he made lots of friends easily but it was good to see how an ENFJ thinks of people when they dont have to do the whole Fe being nice to everyone thing and how much a person can really get on their nerves.\n\nFunnily enough, my brother started dating an ISFJ girl and I think they're great for each other. I'm also close with his girlfriend and we treat other like siblings and we have similarities in terms of personality and viewpoints and humor styles. I feel like I might have influenced my brother to have a thing for (healthy) ISFJs because ever since he started dating his ISFJ girlfriend he's had less motivation to interact with other people even on social media (which is how they met and my brother was actually more popular than her on Instagram by far)\n\nMy boss at my previous company was an ENFJ and I really respect him since he was always a forward thinker and he was great for helping me move forward and get more confident in my career.\n\nI go to him for advice in my field from time to time and I like his positivity, open mindedness and knowledge.\n\nSadly the company I worked with him as a boss decided to close down the department and I can't work with him or the other cool employees anymore (but this new company I work at is great too).\n\nThat said, as you can tell I've had VERY good with experience with ENFJs and now they're one my favorite types.
1	I'm another ENFJ who is dating an ISFJ; my mum is also an ISFJ. I would defend the fuck out of the both of them, despite them being much, much older than me 😂\n\nI feel like I have loved every ISFJ I've met! You guys rock.\n\nAlso, you sound like a great brother. You guys must have the greatest roommate experience ever.
1	Hmm, I have one friend who's ENFJ, although they're 6-7 years older than me and we both have various types and levels of mental health things going on, so that may impact my experience with them slightly. \n\nBasically though I think they're great! I mostly know them online, but I got to spend a long weekend with them once and was mostly extremely happy about it; they accidentally wore me out pretty badly at one point by following a huge art gallery one day with hiking the next, but they made up for it with TV and cuddles later on lol. Basically I washed their dishes/cleaned their kitchen up a bit and they appreciated me for it and we talked a lot and cuddled a lot and I was able to feel honest and it was really nice :')\n\nThis was also probably colored somewhat by the fact that I used to have a huge crush on them and can never quite seem to get all the way over it, though. Feeling domestic with someone was just lovely haha, but I did genuinely feel like we got along really well and had a great time even if there were maybe some moments where I wasn't fully getting my preferred level of attention to my needs (which, to be fair, is pretty high). \n\nOnline is a bit different, because they're extremely social and I'm more anxious online than in person. I tend to have to be the one to contact them, and we talk less and only about certain subjects usually. I want to talk to/comfort them more than I do, but I feel awkward about it a lot of the time. But they always make me feel very warm and welcome and cared for, even if I'm a bit of a self-sabotaging mess. 
1	What are the characteristics of a healthy ISFJ if I may asked? I used to think I was an INTP until I got into a relationship with an ENFJ. He is my ex now. I got really clingy in the relationship, because I felt insecure.
7	ISFJ and ISTJ differences	I've always tested as an ISTJ except for maybe once as an ISFJ. My SO says I can switch back and forth.\n\nWhat would you say is the main difference between the two?
7	Have you looked into cognitive functions? ISFJ and ISTJ have different auxiliary functions, feeling extroversion (Fe) and thinking extroversion (Te) respectively. I don't know where to send you so I won't provide any links, but it's worth googling MBTI cognitive functions.
4	Theoretically, you can't switch back and forth. But you probably aren't switching between anything. You're you. And 99.9% of people aren't exact archetypes. But that's what MBTI is: perfect examples of 16 archetypes. People are more dynamic than that. I have your same problem. I refer to myself as an introverted sensor, or as ISxJ.
4	Since it's getting to be school time for some of us, what are your favorite ways to be organized for your classes?	I'm curious to see if we have similar methods :)
2	[deleted]
2	Already graduated but from what I remember..\n\nI always preferred to use Google keep/EverNote to take notes, was more of a typer over a writer because sometimes I get too hasty writing notes they become illegible\n\nUnless I really didn't care about the class I was usually early to get a good seat (if it wasnt assigned). If the class was lax I'd probably get lazy
2	I am really bad taking notes. My writing is illegible for others and messy, and I get bored easily. If I attend classes is to keep track to know what I have to study after for the test. I usually take part of those student comittees that distribute classes and then share all the notes. The only bad thing about that is that you have to trust that others will do their part well enough and in time. Sometimes I have had problems with that... But normally, the load of work is much less which is appreciated. \nWhen I study I usually make pretty detailed tree-schemes, it's easier for me to remember than if I read directly the notes, but it takes a lot of time. 
2	Hi I'm a college student. Two best things to get organized: A fucking planner and a phone calendar. With the planner, I look at all the syllabus at the beginning of the semester and put all the due dates for homework, when midterms and finals are, and when I should start studying for them. I use the phone calendar to put when classes are and when midterms and finals. I do this so I have two different ways of being organized for classes. I also put in student club meetings, social outings with friends, and student club events in my planner and phone calendar as well. This helped me a lot last year stay organized my GPA went up from a 2.54 to 2.93 as a result from me getting more organized for my classes. Also if you have a smartphone utilize the reminders to remind you to get your work done and set alerts for it as well. Cool thing about a planner and phone calendar with all the dates in it is I can take a look at it at the beginning of the week usually on Sunday and see the homework and tests I have that week so I can plan and study accordingly depend on how much coursework I have that week.\n\nTL,DR: A planner and phone calendar helps me stay more organize and helps know how my week is going to pan out in terms of classes and school activities 
8	Make ISFJS?	I'm a female ENFP in love with a male ISFJ. We're in the same university club, and it's a small group in a small classroom, so when I'm talking (really loudly) to my friend he tends to overhear and replies to whatever I'm talking about. However, he doesn't say "hi" to me if he sees me (and I'm too shy to say hi first) and he doesn't go out of his way to talk to me either. Is there a chance? \n\nAlso, since male ISFJs are quite rare, could you guys tell me more about yourselves? :D
9	If he doesn't make a move and if you don't make a move, i would think the chances are at a 0% probability. Go talk to the guy. Be open and warm. That will greatly increase the odds.
7	I dated a male ISFJ (I am an XNFP), and I can confirm that I had to make all the first moves. Just go for it!
5	Male Isfj here: \nWhen I meet someone, I always take it slow. Trust is ESSENTIAL for me, and building it takes time. We isfjs respond warmly most of the time when someone else initiates a conversation, but we are not always likely to do it ourselves. Relationships take time in our eyes. \nFor me personally, the most important part of who I am is someone who actively tried to help and comfort others when they have problems. Being able to be there for someone brings me joy like nothing else can. I know many isfjs are the same. \nJust know that isfjs are not going to take things fast in terms of relationships most of the time. 
5	How could you be 'in love' when you haven't really talked to him one-on-one?  It sounds more like infatuation, to me.  Make an excuse to talk to him about a project/assignment.  If he's as shy as I think he may be, however, it will be a difficult task getting him to initiate, as all men should.  \n\nI really appreciate others showing interest in me, but I find it difficult to talk about myself, as it makes me feel pompous.  I also often overanalyze things, especially interactions after the fact.  If you can get him to open up through the painful, but necessary, small talk, it should be smooth sailing.  Try to do it when it is only the two of you, as I find it difficult to talk in groups sober (as you should be at school).\n\nAlso keep in mind extroverts and introverts don't make great lovers but I'm sure that has no bearing on you at this point.  Infatuation is infatuation.  Good luck.
3	ISFJ and ISFP in an on-off relationship?	Hello there, ENTJ here.  \n\nMy dad is an ISFP, and my stepmom/his ex-wife is an ISFJ.  They've been having an on-off relationship for 5 years now, and have broken up twice now.  She broke up with him both times because she had problems with him not being emotionally supportive as she would have liked, and his general ISFPness of not liking to be tied down and at her beck and call.  Having spent long amounts of time with the both of them around, a relationship with either of them can sometimes feel like walking on eggshells.\n\nAs of 6 months ago, my stepmom told me they were definitely not getting back together.  But due to a string of recent events this summer, her anxiety has risen to the point where I cannot stand to be around her.  Along with the anxiety came a renewed interest in trying to get back together with my dad.  In fact, she is supposedly 100% invested this reunion.  My dad is unsure about it, but willing to try for the sake of his kids with her.  They're both so stubborn and don't communicate their feelings well, so even if the relationship sucks, they'll both suffer in silence until it reaches a boiling point.\n\nMy question is, why might my ISFJ stepmom be suddenly interested in getting back with my dad?  I'm thinking it's just the anxiety and need for human companionship, and she's willing to settle for my dad.  Is it a long-term thing, or should I plan for her to become a barnacle in his life?  I'm just worried that my dad will get stuck in this loop all over again, when it took him several years to get back to total contentedness with his life.  I don't want her to just use him until she feels like she doesn't need him anymore.  My dad is already starting to feel some resentment from this new relationship, but he'll stick it out forever because he hates confrontation.  \n\nI also want to continue to have a relationship with my dad, but he doesn't have any time because my stepmom has been so needy, and her and I are not currently on speaking terms (arose from her fictitious anxieties).  What do you think, ISFJ's?
2	Sounds to me like you might be pretty close to accurate. Obviously I don't know your stepmom, but I know when I'm feeling very anxious I have to fight down the urge to reach out to other people for comfort. Personally I try not to do that because it makes me feel selfish, although I couldn't say if that's really true or just my bad self-esteem talking :P Anyway though if your stepmom isn't very mature/self-aware it seems possible that she may be using a similar coping mechanism. \n\nAnyway if you're comfortable with it and think he would be open to hearing it, I would try and talk to your dad about it. Hopefully hearing from you that the nature of their relationship is making you feel isolated from him will help him to step back and reevaluate, but I can't say for sure that that will be the case. My aunt's ex-husband has ended up in a similar relationship and for a long time he wasn't willing to do much about it, so it will probably depend a lot on your dad. Good luck, though! 
7	ISFJ Discussion Topic 4: Experiences with ISFPs	This is one of the few types I have little to no experience with sadly.\n\nMaybe I did know some but I still have trouble figuring out what an ISFP is besides artist stereotypes.
6	My identical twin is an ISFP.\nWe get along, but we don't understand each other.\n\nWe always seem to be slightly on different wavelengths, and we've never been the kind of twins that are super super close and share everything. We're extremely different people, with different goals and desires in life, different hobbies, different ways of doing things.\n\n\nWe've often clashed when it comes to the way we prefer to live. I'm very traditional and organized, and very much into the stereotypical white picket fence lifestyle, and I value fairness to an extreme degree. Growing up, I always wanted things to be exactly equal, and I insisted that rules were followed. She didn't care so much about those kinds of things, and she didn't mind bending the rules. I've always been very people-oriented, and I invest a lot of emotional energy in the people I hold close to me, whereas she doesn't seem to value relationships nearly to the same degree.\n\n\nMy ISFP twin, on the other hand, is a lot more free spirited. She's sort of the edgy artist type, she doesn't care so much what people think, and she just doesn't have the same interest in people as I do. She's much more shy, whereas I'm a lot more outgoing. She gets along much better with animals, and she keeps to herself a lot.\n\n\nWe have a pretty comfortable relationship, and we don't have much conflict, but we're fundamentally different people at the core, and we want very different things in life, so while we enjoy spending time around each other and we have fun together, we don't exactly share many deep conversations, and we're both quite private around each other.
3	I dated an ISFP towards the end of high school and into the beginning of college. It was a long-term relationship, but we argued over trivial things a lot. The distance killed it, and looking back, I do not regret it ending.\n\nThat is the extent of my limited experience with ISFPs. Based on that, it wouldn't be my type of choice.
2	I'm dating one right now. He's quiet like I am, and more introverted than I am. He'd prefer to stay at home and play games with his friends online. I can't say much about his S or F other than the obvious, and I can say that he prefers things to play by ear. He's very chill and relaxed, and simple. 
1	Is there anything in particular you wanna know/want help understanding? I'm an isfp so I might be able to help, though I'm not always the best with words.
7	Infp trying to be friends with isfj	Hello, I've started becoming friends with an isfj recently but I'm finding it difficult to connect with them. I really like her but I don't know what to talk about with her. I've always had difficulties bonding with xsfj's. what are some things I can talk about with her? She's very open about her life and have noticed she likes talking about the past but I'm so reserved and I feel guilty for not being able to give more of myself... how can I have conversations with her that she will enjoy but don't involve me having to talk about myself a lot. Sorry if this sounds silly, what I'm asking is what do isfj's want in friendships? What kind of things can an infp offer an isfj in a friendship? 
7	be honest in a warm way. if you're unable to open about your past, maybe be open about your inability to. \n\nyou can say it's difficult for you. and that is an understandable thing.\n\nand then from there you can together find something that's you're both interested in like a show or movie or book series or hobby. then you can talk about that.
6	Isfj's should I date one of you -intp	I recently met an ISFJ who may be one of the most beautiful woman I've ever laid eyes on. Physically she's like a work of art and mentally she seems normal. I'm very attracted to her caring side and it makes me want to praise her non-stop, although I hold myself back because I don't want to come off as over the top. But if I'm being completely honest she has me completely, drool from the mouth, infatuated.\n\nI've been doing a lot of reading and I'm afraid that her not having that mental energy that I so often need to express to someone may be challenging in the long run. I feel that our relationship could be very loving, but I'm just afraid that after the butterflies subside we will see how different we truly are. At the same time, my desire to be with someone who is honest, faithful, and caring is strong and she basically embodies that to a tee. We are still pretty early on in the relationship and haven't committed to anything. I don't want to end up hurting her and myself by going through a rollercoaster relationship (this happened before with my ESFJ gf from high school). But would it make sense for me to end things now for the fear of what could happen? I don't think so\n\nIn just interested in hearing some isfj's thoughts on this. 
7	Well, obviously everyone's experience is going to be different, regardless of MBTI type. There are a whole lot of other factors, like whether you share the same future goals, what your love languages are, how emotionally healthy you are, etc.\n\n\nThat being said, I had a very long ongoing relationship with an INTP, and  I'll share my experiences.\n\n\nWhen things were good, they were very, very good. He made me laugh, he was smart and charming, he could be affectionate, and I was drawn to the fact that he was slightly eccentric and didn't care what other people thought of him. \nHowever, when things were bad, they were so bad. There were so many ups and downs, it was a real emotional rollercoaster. \n\n\nOur communication styles were different, and we ran into a lot of issues with that. I wanted a lot more emotional openness and vulnerability than he was willing (or able) to give me, and I often felt like he had a wall up. I felt completely deprived of affection at times, and I often felt like the relationship was very one-sided, with me doing most of the work.\n\n\nI'm a very affectionate, nurturing sort of person, but I do need a certain amount of that in return, and I most definitely wasn't getting enough from him. He would go through phases of obsession with something like a videogame or a hobby, and I would feel totally ignored and neglected. To me, it often felt like once he had won me over and figured me out, he dropped me for something else that he found more interesting, and it was kind of a cycle that would repeat.\n\n\n\nWhen I would try to communicate these issues with him, or explain that my needs weren't being met, he felt attacked, and from his perspective, it felt like I was pointing out his flaws. I honestly don't believe he was even capable of giving me what I needed in a relationship, and I did feel neglected often, while I'm sure he felt smothered, to a degree.\n\n\nWhen we had any kind of conflict, he would stonewall me and give me the cold shoulder for days, which always killed me, because I can't stand that kind of treatment from somebody I love and care about. \n\n\nWe brought out the best in each other, but we also brought out the worst, and I've never experienced so much love, passion, conflict and anger in a relationship as I did with him. \n\n\nGranted, my INTP had depression and low self esteem, which was probably a contributing factor when it came to some of our issues. I was hung up on him for nearly 6 years off and on, and I had so much trouble moving on from him, just because there was so much love and chemistry between us. \n\n\n\nAs of now, I've been in a relationship with an ESFJ for a year, and it's been such a different experience, it's only now that I feel like I've really come to terms with how toxic my relationship with my INTP was. I feel like all of my needs are being met, communication is a total breeze, he puts in about the same amount of effort as I do, and our love languages are similar. We haven't had any conflict at all, versus my experience of having a massive fight every couple of months in my previous relationship.\n\n\nI think an ISFJ-INTP relationship can work, but it may be difficult at times, and you're both going to have to put in a lot of effort when it comes to communication. You're going to have to make a real effort to be gentle with her feelings (we are very sensitive), and try not to become irritated if she does get hurt easily. She's going to have to have a thicker skin around you, and rely on outside family and friend relationships to have more of her needs met. If you guys can learn to resolve disagreements in a civilized, polite way, and you're both trying to make sure you're meeting the other person's needs as best you can, I think you'll be alright. It may not be the most natural or easy pairing, but I certainly grew a lot as a person from my relationship.
6	I am an INTP and my wife is an ISFJ and we are extremely compatible. Rather than having an emotional disconnect, I am able to observe and intellectually comprehend what she needs emotionally, which oftentimes is just a calm and rational sounding board, which is very easy for me to be.  Likewise, it is very easy for me to validate her emotions.  Meanwhile, she is kind, honest, and caring, and this reliability helps me stay secure and comforted in the stability of our relationship (that is, she gives me nothing for me to over-analyze or be anxious about).  Also, she really is the most extroverted introvert, and handles/maintains our social life, which works great for me, and is very patient when I come down with a bit of monomania.  So much depends on the individuals involved, but if you focus outside of yourself on the other, this personality combination can be a rewarding and satisfying match. I don't mean this to come off as boastful, but it really is my experience.
26	Slow Reaction Time	Does anyone else here feel like they have trouble reacting in a timely way. I often feel like I spend so much of every moment observing and categorizing my observations that I lag behind others in responding to current stimulus. The only way I've been able to compensate for that is to predict and plan out actions ahead of time.
22	Holy shit yes, I feel stupid at times because of this 
9	There are literally dozens of us!\n\nI usually resign to just shutting up.
8	Oh, yes! Especially if somebody talks to me and tells me a story or asks for my opinion I usually take quite a few silent seconds to sort my thoughts. With people I know this is not a problem but when I meet somebody new they can get thrown off.\n\nMy colleague asked me for feedback on her work on a regular basis. The first time she had a small freakout when I just looked at it without saying anything. "It's that bad??!" Later we did the same while sitting with a new colleague while I looked over their work and she calmed him down saying: "Ah, it's just P4x taking his time. He will give us an honest opinion soon." :D\n\n
4	You're not the only one
6	ISFJ Discussion Topic 3: Experiences with ENFPs	From my experience can ENFPs can be some of the most excitable people to hang out with (positive energy) but sometimes can be the most exhausting in large doses.\n\nI've had a few ENFPs Ive been really close with at one point or another but somewhere along the way due to different interests or something we all kinda just stopped talking.\n\nThat said its cool that it was cool the ones I made had similar interests to me.
6	My best friend is an ENFP!! She's absolutely phenomenal  and my absolute favorite person even though we've drifted a bit since she moved away for college about 4 years ago. She's so enthusiastic and thoughtful and kind, and so smart and funny and generally wonderful. I love her with my whole heart and we get along great even though we're really, really different people. \n\nShe can make me feel so genuinely and completely loved and she doesn't expect me to be anything I'm not even when I feel like a terrible, undeserving friend. It's always a little shocking how happy she is to see me and that she reciprocates my feelings, but I can't doubt her. I really struggle with guilt and feeling like I'm a failure, especially when it comes to friends, but she's one of few people in the world who can really make me feel like I'm enough just the way I am and it means so much to me. I think I need to go text her and tell her how much I love her now! 
2	My brother-in-law is an ENFP and I love him to pieces. He's charismatic and outgoing and I admired him long before my sister married him. \n\nIn general I find them really charming and I don't know too many but I love them. \n\n( keep doing these discussion topics! )
2	One of my closest friends is an ENFP. Now, that I think of it, he seems to be the only extrovert in my small circle of friends. I like how he always has a story to tell, and the natural way he tells it - I really wish I could mingle so naturally in group discussions like he does. We share a similar sense of foolish humour - we love small stupid or weird things (I guess this is the Ne clicking).\n\nAnother thing I like about him is the way he brings together people from different circles. Five or six years ago I had almost no friends. I knew him from high school (we weren't even so close back then) and one day he invited me to have a drink with former hs colleagues. Naturally I would have said 'no' and stayed in my comfort zone. I said 'why not' instead and it was probably the best decision I made in the last five years. Through him I got back in touch with a former friend (INTJ) and I met one of my best and closest friends (INTP).\n\nOn the other side, he seems to have an alcohol problem - he's a heavy drinker and I am really not into it. He also has some issues from his troubled childhood and sometimes projects a negative energy around him. He complains about sometimes mundane stuff and I always feel drained/exhausted after he does this. Despite this, he's an interesting man and I enjoy his company.
5	Could I be an ISFJ?	**Is there anything that may affect the way you answer the questions? For example, a stressful time, mental illness, medications, special life circumstances? Other useful information includes sex, age, and current state of mind.**\n\nFemale, 22, currently relaxed.\n\n**Describe yourself as a person if you were to introduce yourself to someone else like in a cover letter. What kind of person are you and why?**\n\nI don’t know what I’d say in an actual cover letter if I were introducing myself, so I’m just going to describe myself. I’m easygoing, really relaxed most of the time, hardly get stressed or worried about things, and I love to enjoy life. I’m pretty lazy and I’m hard to motivate. Even if I want to do something like lose weight, it’s hard for me to actually get motivated and dedicate time and effort into losing weight, partially because I really love food. I don’t have life goals, I have no idea what I want to do in the future, and I’m not an ambitious person. I’m easy to get along with, can converse about many topics so I guess I’m pretty open-minded, and I like to keep things peaceful. Because I’m all about peace and comfort, I don’t like doing things out of my comfort zone and I’m very conflict-averse. I’m accommodating, have a hard time making any of my own decisions or taking initiative, and I’m an agreeable person. I typically either have strong opinions or no opinion at all (or not really). I’m extremely materialistic, have a hard time saving money, and I’m interested in anything aesthetically pleasing including fashion or anything beauty related, photography, and interior design. I’m not a risk taker, like stability and security, and have a good memory for detail. I’m ethical, reserved, shy, and it’s hard for me to get close to people and feel comfortable with them to the point where I’d open up or express my feelings to them. I’m pretty bad at dealing with people who are being emotional to me. I’m kind of a follower as opposed to a leader and I’m very passive and easily taken advantage of. \n\n**What were you like as a child? Think about how you were in school, with friends, and at home with your family.**\n\nAs a child, I was friendly and active; I liked playing sports as a child, but now I’m very physically inactive. In the classroom, I was a good student, but I was also quiet and hardly ever participated. A lot of my friends in school enjoyed bullying me, not because they thought something was wrong with me, but because they just thought it was fun to hit me or pick on me since I never did anything back to them and never spoke up for myself. At home with my family, I was helpful; I used to help my mom with chores a lot, and she said that I was fast with my hands, but that I’m now too slow. When I was still in elementary, I enjoyed going outside and traveling to random places with my siblings even though we had no idea where we were going. I wasn’t that obedient to my parents at home. I still did unsafe activities even though I was told not to, such as go out into the streets alone. \n\n**What kind of person would you LIKE to be? Why? What kind of person would you NOT want to be? Why?**\n\nI’d like to be someone who’s kind, but able to stand up for themselves and speak up when necessary because I admire people like this. I also want to be someone who has their future envisioned and who are passionate about things because I’m not a passionate person and I have no future dream. I want to be someone who’s artistic and good at writing because even though my writing skills aren’t bad, I want to be even better. I also want to know how to draw really well. I want to be someone who has their shit together/planned out, and is achieving enough to actually go after what they want because those people work hard and have the motivation that I lack. \n\nI don’t want to be someone who’s unethical and selfish because I don’t like those kind of people. Those people who go after what they want at any means necessary without being concerned about how it’ll affect other people annoy me. I don’t want to be someone who’s only concerned about money. I wouldn’t want to be someone who’s excessively pessimistic, worrying about things that could go wrong, and complaining all the time because they drain my energy and annoy me. I also don’t want someone who’s rude and lacks manner or someone who’s aggressive, competitive, and controlling. \n\n**Do you think there are any differences to how you described yourself and how people actually perceive you? How do you think others would describe you? If there are any discrepancies between these two that are you are aware of; do you know why exactly that is?**\n\nFor the most part, I believe the way I described myself is how people perceive me. One discrepancy is that people see me as lazier than I actually am because most of my friends are friends I made back in high school, and that was when I was so lazy to the point where it was too much. In high school, I didn’t care about my grades at all and I all I did was enjoy life and disregard my responsibilities like homework and studying. I’m a lot less lazy than I once was before. People also underestimate my intellect; a lot of my friends think I’m a bit dumb, but I’m actually not. Others would describe me as chill, funny, a spender, open-minded, shy, a pushover, slow-paced, too agreeable, nice, helpful, and friendly. They would also describe me as a homebody, lazy, easily irritated, indecisive, and two-faced. A long time ago, many people thought I was a big mouth who liked to gossip too much.\n\n**What in life do you find to be of importance? Why?**\n\nI believe it’s important to be happy and stress-free in life. I don’t think people should overwork themselves too much or expect too much out of life just in case they end up struggling to meet those expectations and as a result, get stressed out and/or unhappy. I believe it’s important to just do what makes you happy otherwise you’ll live a life you won’t really like, and you might end up regretting the path you took because you aren’t living life how you prefer to live it. To me, happiness is more important than things like money or status. I also believe it’s important to treat others how you want to be treated, and to not deceive people.\n\n**How do you react to new situations in your life? Can you describe an event in your life where you were in an unknown situation? How did you deal with it?**\n\nI don’t adapt to change as quickly or easily as I’d like to. I feel like it might be because I’ve become so comfortable and situated in a situation I’m already used to, and that makes me more hesitant to change. That along with not knowing what to expect. If the new situation isn’t anything too big (traveling, trying a new activity, etc) I’m fine with it for the most part. However it’s kind of bad if it’s something like a new job or anything that involves waiting to know what the outcome will be (good or bad). I was put in an unknown situation when I started working a completely different job, and I disliked not knowing how I’d end up performing after training, which was hard for me. Because of that, I quit during training. Another situation was when my family and I moved into a new house. For that, I reacted and adapted pretty well. I did prefer my old home, but it was easy for me to get used to living in the new house. \n\n**Please describe yourself when you are in a stressful situation. How do you act and why?**\n\nWhen I’m stressed, I’m more easily irritated and prefer others to not bother me. Besides that, I don’t really know because I don’t catch myself stressed out that often. I guess I’m also more impulsive and irrational when I’m stressed out, and want to make hasty choices without thinking clearly first. \n\n**Describe your relationship to socialization. How do you perceive one-on-one interaction? How do you perceive group interaction?**\n\nI’m okay with socializing if it isn’t for too long because if it’s too long, I start to get tired. One on one interactions are nice if I’m comfortable with the person and they’re easy to talk to, but if not then I prefer group interaction. Actually just in general, I prefer group interaction because I can listen more than speak whereas in a one to one interaction, it’s always a back and forth exchange between me and the other person. If I’m not involved in the interaction though, I find one on one interactions more appealing because they seem more intimate and from an outside perspective, it would seem like the two people have a really strong connection. However for me personally, I’d rather be involved in a group interaction. \n\n**Describe your relationship to society. What are the elements of it you hold important or unimportant (e.g. social norms, values, customs, traditions)? How do you see people as a whole?**\n\nI'd say that most social norms, values, customs, and traditions are okay, but I don't care whether or not they should be kept or followed. However there are some social norms and etc that I don't particularly agree with. I don't have much of an opinion on people as a whole. I guess some people are cool whereas some people are annoying. One thing I always think is that people should stop trying so hard to be who they aren't to the point where they'd do something like act rude to others just because their friends are like that. I feel like many people make things complicated when they don't have to be. Other than all of that, I actually don't pay that much attention to society or anything.\n\n\n**Describe your relationship to authority. How do you perceive authority? What does it mean to you, and how do you deal with it?**\n\nI don’t really like authority because many people abuse the power they have. I also dislike authority because I feel like people should treat everybody equally, so I don’t find things like authority, hierarchy, and power appealing. Even if I was in a position of power, I don’t think I’d want to exercise it. In terms of my relationship, I listen to those in authority even if I don’t want to just in case something bad happens to me if I don’t obey them. \n\nDescribe your relationship to order and chaos. What do order and chaos mean to you? How do they manifest in your daily life?\n\nI don’t have much of an opinion on order, but I dislike chaos because I like having at least a little bit of control over my situation just so things don’t go out of hand and turn super chaotic, which would be hard for me to deal with.\n \n**What is it that you fear in life? Why? How does this fear manifest to you both in how you think and how you act?**\n\nI don’t have any strong fears, but I guess I would say that I fear conflict because it’s hard for me to deal with and because I don’t want to make enemies with anyone since it would feel so awkward if I have to see them, knowing that we got into some issues and dislike each other. It’s also just something that makes me uncomfortable. This manifests in how I think and act in that I fear conflict to the point of not standing up for myself even for the simplest things ever, and I can’t even speak up when I know it’s necessary to. Other than that, I also fear public speaking because I hate attention and feeling like people are possibly judging me for either how I look/sound or how my presentation is. \n\n**What is it that you desire in life? What do you strive to achieve? Why? Where do you think these drives and desires stem from or are inspired by?**\n\nI desire a happy, relaxed life as well as my ideal appearance. I desire all the designer items on my wishlist. I also desire stability and financial security. I don’t know what I strive to achieve lol.\n\n**What activities energize you most? What activities drain you most? Why?**\n\nThe activities that energize me most include listening to music, watching shows and movies, eating good food, being on the computer, and relaxing at home. The activities that drain me the most include being out for too long, being in crowded areas, listening to someone talk excessively without giving me a turn to reply, and anything too physically active. \n\n**Finally, is there something else you find to be of importance you want to add about yourself you think might be of relevance when helping to type you?**\n\n- My enneagram is 9w1 SP, tritype 269 I think (not in that order). \n- My temperament is phlegmatic and sanguine\n- I’m not nice or helpful because I care about other people or want them to be happy, but because I either feel obligated to help, want to avoid conflict/haters, or feel like I should be doing something (like holding the door for others, etc) because it’s the right thing to do. \n- I’m good at reading other people’s motives and usually pick up vibes about their character when first meeting them. \n- I dress for appearance, not for comfort\n- I’ve been through a lot of phases in life such as a preppy phase, a gothic phase, a tomboy phase, a scene phase, and stuff like that when I was in my teen years. \n\nTypes I'm stuck between: ISFP and ISFJ\n\nResults from similarminds cognitive functions test: highest percent is Si followed by Fi, Se, Fe, Ni, Te, Ne, then Ti.
3	I would say ISFP because the emphasis on physical experiences/sensations and appearance sounds more like Se than Si to me, and I get and Fi vibe from your answers about social norms and interaction. There's a lot of "I agree with/disagree with" which reads more Fi to me? 
2	Out of curiosity, where did the questions/questionnaire come from?\nKinda intrigued.
2	I think I agree with /u/reinventwisdom. Plus, you talked about going through different phases in high school. I don't know that ISFJs experiment that much. Sounds like SP to me.
2	I think you're probably ISFP rather than ISFJ. I think ISFJs don't tend to struggle as much with motivation, and while we're easy going... I don't think people really describe us as lazy.\n\nAlso in terms of what you were saying about authority and traditions doesn't quite track.\n\nI also picked up on what you said about getting the chance to reply.. that sounds a bit more Fi to me.
4	Please describe ISFJ's Si.	I always wondered what having Si as your dominant function is like. \n\nPlease describe your memories! Are they really that vivid as people say?
6	so impressions is the word used most often to talk about isfj memories. but i'm not sure how well that explains it to an non isfj.\n\nthe way it feels to me is like: the memories aren't 100% exact but they're close.\n\nthey're fairly accurate. but they're feel based. the details remembered are focused around the thing that we felt strongly about.\n\nso, imagine that you're detail focused. you notice how things feel, how things sound, how things smell, that's like all the time all you notice. and then something happened. and it made you feel something (like someone said something harsh or you ate a new something for the first time and it was delicious). \n\nso you store the memory of that feeling and the particular things you sensed that have anything to do with that feeling. and when you recall the feeling, a bunch of those senses come back up.\n\nif your emotions related to words someone said, you'll often remember the exact words and tones and expressions and how they made you feel as you sensed them bit by bit. if it was the food example, you'll remember the texture, the smell, the taste, and how when you sensed them all at once, it made you so happy. each little thing as reacted to. each little thing was something that lead to how the event as a whole impacted you and the way you felt. so since the memories are based on each of those feelings, the details are easily connected and can be recalled.\n\nthat's why impressions is a great word to describe isfj memories. it's not like we're able to remember everything accurately. it's only around our feelings that we pull up details, and only the details we notice or associate with those feelings.
5	Yes they are, but I wouldn't say they're as complete as memories would suggest... more like impressions. 
5	I'm really late on this but I just wanna chime in and say nope, not for me!! This is one of my least favorite ISFJ stereotypes because my memory is really terrible haha. I have some sleep/attention issues that are probably why, but I just wanna point out that it isn't universally true! \n\nBut to answer your question a little better, what memories I do have tend to be single images, which I recall the main focal point of but not necessarily all of the smaller details. For me it's like primary vs peripheral vision; I technically see what's on the periphery and I might be able to identify some of it, but most of it is almost subconscious. 
2	Yeah I can have a really good recall of past memories. Especially if they had a big impact in my life I can replay emotions and images of the memory in pretty good accuracy
6	ISFJ Discussion Topic 2: Experiences with ESTPs	I've had a few ESTPs Ive interacted well with: one who I really love a lot and one who I had mixed feelings with.\n\nOne thing I think is good about them in general is they know how to  have fun without being as loud as say as an Extroverted Fi user.\n\nThe first ESTP I know was basically my second mother growing up. She essentially did all the household cores a bunch of the cleaning and babysitting while parents were at work.\n\nI think at that point of taking care of me she had very developed Fe because she knew how to be nurturing without being overbearing (which my ISFJ and ESTJ parents could be pretty often).\n\nI'd say her ESTP traits tend to show more when she talks about her past or once she leaves the house to have fun. She has a strong attitude of "If you got a shitty situation just do what you can to find and make the best of it". THere are other things more personal I could talk about it but I'll say it defines her as ESTP more.\n\nDue to her situation she kinda has to rely on her friends to pick her up to hang out since she doesnt have drivers license but she keeps saying that if she could drive she'd almost never be at home when not working.\n\nAs for the other ESTP, he was a previous coworker. His job tended to be talking to clients and adapting to their needs well. The thing he sometimes had a case of "making promises he possibly couldn't keep" thing which meant delaying things.\n\nOf all the team members he tended to be te person who act on his own without telling people or getting approval. It did get the job done and sometimes it was good what he did but it kinda disrupted the order of things sometimes so it could be frustrating.
2	My best friend in middle school was almost certainly an ESTP - I would go over his house and we would always make up athletic, active games. His energy was infectious and it really helped my development in terms of not being scared of Se ... as long as someone else is taking lead, of course!
1	One of my close friends is an ESTP\nOverall he is a good person which i know I can always rely on.\nI think we get good along because he makes the plans on what to do and I like to follow him. He has a very big ego and sometimes i even think he is a narcisst. If we are in our friendcircle which is lead by a ENFJ there is sometimes a conflict between those too but in the end he accepts the decision of him. He is interrested in various fighting clubs and wants to start a sport like MMA. He hates it if we do something simple because he is bored then. He likes to party and would like to go clubbing every weekend. Hes got huge problems with showing his emotions and talking about big thinks but he trusts me and talks if he feels like it about them with me.\n\nIf you have any specific questions just ask i am glad if this helps you
18	Do any of you ISFJs have social anxiety? How does it manifest in you?	I'm unsure if I really have social anxiety, I don't want to self-diagnose but it seems like it, and I'm wondering how it affects other ISFJs. 
11	I have social anxiety and i think it's because I'm always hyper aware of other people's feelings. I've always been really sensitive, not only for myself but for other people. I'm constantly afraid of saying or doing something that'd hurt someone else's feelings that I get anxiety over it. If I go to a party, I have to act interested and excited and invested in small talk or conversations I don't enjoy. If I do otherwise, it'll hurt their feelings or make them feel bad. I can go on with different scenarios. It's easier to stay at home. \n\n
4	Can you describe the experience of social anxiety for you? Social anxiety is very common for us, yes, but there are ways to combat it. If you can tell us how you approach social situations / relationships and what happens that causes you anxiety, we can give you some advice. =)\n\nFor me I get really insecure about whether the people around me are actually attached securely to me, and I also get this persistent feeling that I need to be in front of the people I care about or I'm going to be forgotten about. If I say anything I consider emotionally risky I obsess over what their response will be or if I was out of line in what I said.
3	I tend to be really anxious whenever I'm dealing with a situation that I'm not prepared for; whenever my Ne doesn't give me an idea on how to act during a certain situation, then my stress is expressed through nausea.
2	I've had it for years. I've went on medication for it (slowly getting off of it atm) and therapy. It was a LOT worse when I was younger. I still have it buts it's not as bad. I still go through cycles and pit falls but in getting better at it. Exercise helps and such. Honestly reading up on it, MBTI, therapy, and exercise have helped me "deal with it" a little better but that's just me 
8	ISFJs, share experiences you have had with... Topic 1: INTJs	New topic series I want to start for fun (I'll start other ones later on).\n\nIn these I just want simply ask the experiences ISFJs have had with INTJs whether its people their friends with, went to school with, worked with or even just talked to online.\n\nI have trouble figuring out if the people who claim to be INTJ and many MBTI related forums to be INTJ.\n\nThat said the ones Ive known and talked to are pretty chill. I know a few girls who typed as INTJ through a test who are fellow anime fans. I talk with one of them often, she can be surprisingly talkative about anime interests we have in common (much more than me). \n\nHowever I can at least see the Ni-Te in her. She loves being fiercely independent as possible. She'll always be very pragmatic with her buys. Even with strict (asian) parents she'll find a way to get around to doing exactly what she wants to do.\n\nWhen deciding which car she wants to ride in when our group of friends are going in, she tends to side with me since she knows I'm good with directions + a safe driver.
2	My sister is an intj. Growing up together, we found that we understood things very differently and taught each other to see things differently.\n\nShe's smart, stubborn, and objective. She showed me how to be more objective. I taught her the value of people with good intentions and loyalty.\n\nA close friend of mine is also one. He's ambitious, also objective, and of the few friends I have that's into actively applying philosophy into his life. My sis did too. \n\nHe is also open to using political manuvering for his goals so long as it doesn't involve hurting others. He's moral about it, which is great. I know a lot of people that considers it wrong or evil regardless. And I also know people who do it for personal gain at the expense of others. So it's refreshing that he can do that and be focused on good.\n\nActually, him and my sister are both like that. They'll do things... Sneaky like... And manipulative like even, so long as they believe the end results are good for everyone.\n\nThough he's more nice about it. And she is a lot more tough love.
2	lmao my fiance is an INTJ. It had been a very volatile relationship for a long time - his Ni was very aggravated by my Si. He caused me a lot of growth though, and I've been figuring out how to be better at Ti-Ne. I've been making actual plans (and writing them down!!), being more tolerant of intuition, and pushing myself by taking a deep breath and trying some of the terrifying things he proposes to me. It's still tough sometimes but when it's good, we both really cover up for each other's weaknesses, it's great.
6	ISFJ Learning Styles	In Chapter 13 of Gifts Differing, Myers and Myers go into how Learning Styles differ by type. Laying out the ways in which Sensors learn differently to Intuits.\n\nAre there things you find particularly difficult when it comes to learning? Are there any tricks you've found in overcoming these problems? Have your experiences put you off learning particular things?
7	For me, I've always found many of the hard sciences pretty challenging. Getting into Computing, I've realized that I just don't have the same aptitude for immediately grasping things as other people do, and this has left me feeling a bit dumb at times.\n\nI would say I can be pretty logical, but anything to do with transformations/relationships with things are really hard to me. Even simple things like reading a map upside down, where I have to flip directions in my head and all that kind of thing. I suppose it all boils down to very poor spatial reasoning.\n\nLearning itself has always been quite practical in a way, and by practical I don't necessary mean it has to be tactile. Rather, it's heavily directed towards examples of things... and in many ways I feel like when I'm answering questions I have to "translate" it in my head, so I can map it to real things that I can grasp.\n\nThere are many branches of mathematics for example, that I will take hours and hours to learn simple parts of, particularly in the field of abstract algebra, just because I cannot conceive of what kind of thing it is.\n\nI guess how I've worked around these things is getting very good at explaining things in terms of what I already know, so when I'm faced with a very abstract problem I can focus on what the real and particulate things are, and then try and understand it from a sensing point of view.\n\nOf course that leaves me being accused of lacking generality by intuits, but at least it gives me the chance to tackle the problem.
7	I'm very fortunate in that I was naturally really precocious and smart. It was tough as an ISFJ in school -  everyone wanted to pigeonhole me as an INTP because of my intelligence, so trying to make friends was really hard. It led to me not pushing myself as much to excel scholastically to instead focus on my peers. (My Fe hated that I was ostracized, so I had little choice but to figure out how people/communities worked - even with Ti trying to tell me I was, like, super independent and didn't need other people to care about me!!)\n\nI have trouble with the abstract and theoretical as well. I was exceedingly good at algebra and precalc but confused my teachers as to why I was bad at geometry/trig, and then when I got into college and calculus I got really lost. \n\nI would recommend an Si-dom focus on their strengths to improve learning. We can become experts by focusing on what we're interested in because once we get interested, we stay interested for life. Identify the domains you want to focus on and as long as you're comfortable and enjoy it, keep grinding at it. The key part is to not let others shame you for not trying to be the best at everything - know your limits, know your what you like, and prove your worth there. It can be hard since school wants you to learn every field, but keep in mind: you don't have to be the best at every field. Just competent. Focus on what you find enjoyable and don't stress out about not measuring up in the rest.
3	learning is slow for me. i find when i learn something new i have to reflect on it and measure it up to a lot of other things i have stored away in my head. they're like...rules i made up from my observations or previous things i've learned. i believe this to be what makes isfj cling so much to tradition. these rules to me just seem right and constant. and straying from them is often emotionally felt inside as a dumb move.\n\nand when something new i learn clashes with these rules i have, i need to diligently force myself to go through everything i knew that made those rules in the first place, and find where those rules break apart/are wrong in order to accept the new thing i learned.\n\nbefore i used to be more stubborn about it. i could even deny real true facts in order to keep the "facts" i've worked so hard for. these facts that i have used to keep me safe and help predict outcomes. i can't just...throw them away! but i got over that. now i'm prepared to break them apart.\n\nbut i still don't have a solution to speed up the process. it's all meticulous and grinding through details and finding connections.
2	Math was definitely the most difficult subject for me in school. Even trying a pretty wide breadth of math courses (statistics, calculus, linear algebra, trigonometry/math analysis...), there wasn't a single branch of math that I was able to understand or excel in. I was always that kid that would use **way** too many steps to solve a math problem to try and make sense of it all, in the end overcomplicating every problem. I still get flack from people for using long division, but it's because I can't do any of those calculations in my head. When faced with a "real world" math problem,  I have to write it down on paper and work out each step to find an answer. I cannot figure even basic math out unless I'm able to work the problem out with pencil and paper. One thing that always frustrated me about math was that there was always one exact answer, and so many places where some small error could throw the entire result off. I still thank my lucky stars that my miraculous 3 in AP calculus tested me out of all math in college....
1	I'm more of a hands-on learner. I definitely don't learn from being told what to do or reading notes or instructions. The only time I would prefer reading notes and instructions is when it's sort of a self-help thing that I initiated for myself to get through an emotional obstacle. \n\nWith regards to the map commentary, I'm in the same boat. I can't read a map upside down. It was hard for me to navigate the streets of Chicago when I went there for vacation so I relied on my ISTJ sister to do it. I simply gave up and felt no need for stress so I relied on Uber to get mostly everywhere when I was on my own. All my sister had to do was screenshot the map on my phone, and off we went with no hitches; distance and orientation of the map was not an issue for her at all. \n\nIn terms of school, if I can't relate to the subject at hand, for sure I struggled. And my worst subjects were History and whatever sine-cosine-tangent math is; I think thats trig? Anyway, I failed that math course (35%) and scored a 98% in business mathematics. I can't relate to angles, I guess? If anyone is curious, I ended up with a HRM and Operations Management diploma. And now currently working in the Finance industry so it all worked out.
1	It's interesting that many ISFJs have struggle with math. As an ISFJ, numbers have always come natural to me. I have the gift of doing basic arithmetic in my head. I have also excelled in almost all math courses (stats, pre-cal) only math I struggled with a bit was Calculus but still got a 4 on the AP Exam. I'm an accounting major in college  right now and have tend to gravitate towards subjects that are practical and have applications to life. In college, I tend to struggle with subjects and courses that are too abstract and theoretical and that's hard for me to apply to real life. I really think the key for us ISFJs is finding something we love, once we find that we're good because we have the work ethic to be able to do. Like me I'm studying accounting and I love it and know I have the work ethic to do well in this field. Also as ISFJs, avoiding  courses and college majors that are too theoretical and abstract. 
9	Will ISFJs say something insincere just to be nice?	I've noticed that with pretty much all of the ISFJs I've encountered, they are always really warm and friendly and suggest meeting up or doing something in the future. I get along with some of them pretty well and could see myself becoming good friends with them. However, when I actually contact them about hanging out, they seem kind of reluctant/avoidant and tend to "disappear", become kind of dodgy and stop replying. Am I misreading their politeness for friendship? Do they actually not want to hang out and are just saying it to be nice? Twice?! I am an ISTP and need help with this stuff so any insights will be appreciated. :)
14	[deleted]
6	Hmm, that seems kinda weird.... I think we definitely do go out of our way to be as nice as we possibly can, so that part isn't super surprising? Like, if I don't know someone super well or haven't spent a lot of time with them I'll maintain a super sweet and friendly face 24/7 unless I really hate them lol. But in my case, while I might be like "yeah totally!" if they suggest we hang out even if I don't really want to, I would never extend the offer myself unless I really meant it. Social interaction is so tiring for me that I wouldn't wanna put myself in a position to upset one or both of us by making an offer I didn't mean and wouldn't want to follow through on. \n\nSo, I think ISFJs 100% do hide behind a polite and friendly mask a lot of the time and may very well say things just to be nice or avoid hurting feelings, but this particular instance seems weird to me. The niceness and the avoidance make sense to me for ISFJs in separate instances, but not when you put them together like that. I wish I could tell you more, but I can't imagine what they were thinking. I hope you have better ISFJ luck in the future :( 
4	Hi, can you describe or give examples about HOW you are asking them to hang out? It sounds like you're probably trying to engage them in a way that makes sense to you but not to them. That does sound more like the polite non-response I give if I'm not extremely interested in hanging out with someone. I wouldn't mind hanging out conceptually, so it wasn't insincere, but I might not want to once it becomes specific.\n\nFor myself, when I meet someone, I rarely get excited about the person right off the bat. Si-doms like us need to warm up to the person and share experiences with that person first. A considerate E or an alluring N who pays specific attention to me will get me a little excited but that's about it. An ISTP, well.. I don't often find a lot of.. THERE, there. ISTPs tend to be really reserved and don't open up about themselves, which ISFJs appreciate - if we decide we like you, and want to learn more about you, and then you resist sharing your thoughts/feelings/emotions, we're pretty apt to give up quickly.  An ISFJ wants to latch on to "I have a situation that I don't know how to solve." An ISTP is going to want to fix his stuff himself and tell the ISFJ "Yeah, I'm fine. How are you?"\n\nAlso, one-on-one hangouts with an introvert I don't know super well can be really uncomfortable. Because of my Fe, I often feel a pressure to act more E than I want to, and try to entertain and keep the conversation going, which can be draining.\n\nI have two pieces of advice for you, one hard (for a IxTP) and one easier but more time-consuming. The hard one is: you could try to perceive if the ISFJ is friendly/interested in the first place on the first meeting, and if you want to be friends with that ISFJ, try opening up about a few of your feelings. Unless you've become more comfortable with your Fe, this is probably gonna be super hard. Talk about something that makes you happy, or frustrates you, or subtly indicate that there is a simple, specific problem that the ISFJ can help you with. (Going too complex/general right off the board - "I'm lonely and need a friend!" - might scare us off.)\n\nThe easier one is to be nearby the ISFJ in a group setting long enough for us to feel an affinity for you even if we don't get excited by you. Like, are they into D&D? Sports? Music? Board games? "Hey, me and a few friends are going to play board games Saturday, would you like to come?" is likely to be more successful than "Hey, do you want to hang out on Saturday?" It's not something I'm necessarily proud of, but once I view someone as part of my "pack," I'm more friendly to them, even if they don't excite me. I remember past experiences with them, and my brain goes "Yeah, that was pleasant and comfortable. They didn't do anything that made me feel uncomfortable or awkward. I'll probably have a good time hanging out with him."
3	I'm occasionally guilty of politely agreeing to an offer to "hang out sometime"  but then not proactively trying to plan any get-together. Usually this is because of one of two things: I'm either scared that I won't be a good enough conversationalist and will bore/disappoint the person in question (if it's someone I admire), or I perceive the person in question as being flaky, a bad influence, or draining to be around. \n\nOn a more general note though, I don't find myself dropping compliments or saying nice things to people just for the sake of being polite. I'll compliment you on some aspect of your personality, talents, or appearance only if I really do admire that thing and want to know more about it. 
3	YUP!\n\nWe do that. No doubt. It's not a good thing.
3	just look at that some of the words in the head in the top right corner.\n\ncooperative, considerate, follows rules, low key, devoted, service minded, conscientious, kind, honor commitments.\n\nthese are traits of someone that does things because they feel they have to based on kindness and adhering to or enforcing certain expectations to ensure people are ok. it's an act of kindness and care taking.\n\nand kindness is different from an open hearted love. it's... based in not wanting to hurt and wanting to help, but it's not always based in truth.\n\neven the idea of being a good caretaker. it's like a parent. parents are....they're like people that build protective bubbles around little people in order to control what enters their lives to protect them. and parents are supposed to slowly build these kids up in a controlled way in order for them to live without the bubble. \n\nbut isfj are caretakers for everyone they deem worth or able to be caretakers for. that never ends until we know the person doesn't need it. but we'll do it and assume it's necessary even when it isn't.\n\nso the actions this person has been doing can be a way of protecting people from the hurt of rejection. it's dumb. it's unnecessary. it's dishonest to others and to ourselves. and it's hard not to do that for us. \n\nit's probably also in some ways protecting ourselves from rejection too. and it also keeps the peace, ensuring everyone can stay cooperative. and it keeps things low key. and if we do make a commitment, we'd have to stick to it, so there is a lot of pressure there.\n\nbut on the other hand, just pressure the person to hang out. and they'll agree to it because of the same exact reasons. and as they eventually open up and feel more comfortable maybe friendship can bloom. or not, maybe they suck. maybe you suck. I DON'T KNOW EITHER OF YOU, I CAN'T ASSUME!\n\nthis person hits on some stuff from my past. i had a problem where i'd try to do this with people all the time. and sometimes some people end up to me being like a black hole that sucks up all my time and energy. had to grow out of it and set boundaries, and force myself to open up past nice and into real honest compassion.
1	I do this all the time. 
1	yes
11	Anyone have any ideas for improving the subreddit? In terms of looks or content or anything.	compared to some other subreddits this sub has a real simple feeling to it. I only recently added a logo and sidebar picture. I'm trying to think of a banner idea.\n\nI want to start a temporary topic series where I ask what you guys' experience is with all the 16 types (including other ISFJs)\n\nOther than that I'm trying to think of a way to make this place more active or bustling.\n\nAnyone have any ideas?
9	I think it's going to be tough because ISFJ population on reddit seems really low. I've recently figured out I'm ISFJ and was all excited to start engaging with the community.. hm. Oops. I'm far enough along in my development that I've moved past the Si-Fe insecurity (I'm 35) so the negative stereotypes don't bother me, but man.. I would like to help give the many Si-Ti looping folks more encouragement.\n\nI barely know enough about MBTI or design/community to help out though. I could be a mod if you wanted?
5	I think the level of activity means that some of the secondary things aren't that important right now. Perhaps seeding some posts that others are likely to contribute to would drum up some activity and then building the 'extras' might make sense.
4	Maybe some recurring weekly community things?\n\nMan, it's tough tying it to myer Briggs.\n\nOk. What about... The different sections of my Briggs character portraits? Personal growth from our flaws (like a self reflection thing), relationships, as parents, our jobs. Maybe like a day for each of those and a day for things we need support or advice on?\n\nDesignated days to get people to share and talk and connect might make this community for alive.
3	what about a day that focuses on a famous isfj?
2	I don't see the whole "so you've received an isfj unit" or the "isfj care manual" stickyed to the top like it is in some of the other subreddits. I don't know if we even have one, but I've never seen one.\n\nI think that would be cool. 
1	I like that it's simple. Jmo.
1	More focus on our cognitive functions and how they manifest in our daily lives.
16	Anyone else have trouble talking about themselves?	When I'm talking to my friends about their lives, I'm in my element. I can keep a conversation flowing well for however long, I'm relaxed, calm and most importantly I actually register what they say and build my replies upon that. But when it comes to talking about myself to them, normally the conversation starts to go sour, it gets much harder for me to maintain my flow and I start to get nervous. I'm not sure if its me being unsure about how to describe my own feelings, my friends not being great listeners, or a combination of both - but most times conversations start getting awkward when I'm talking about myself.\n\nMaybe I'm just not an interesting enough person? I think I'm a decent conversationalist, but only when it comes to other people. What about you guys?
9	I'd call myself somewhat egotistical and I like to talk about myself, but only when I feel like it (so haha i'm also selfish). With my friends I don't mind, but to actually answer your question - i DESPISE being asked questions about my life. I know I shouldn't complain, "it's a sign that people care for me", "there are people who wish their parents would ask about their day", but honestly? Please stop asking me about my boyfriend, please stop asking me about college, please stop asking about this and that unless you're very specific people.\n\nThen again I might just be wholly selfish. I'm terrible at talking to other people and remembering things about them unless they're either my boyfriend or my best friend. 
3	you are an interesting person. no one is truly boring. you just have to figure out what you feel, what makes you feel what you feel, and how to communicate the entire depth of that openly and honestly with those around you.\n\nmaybe this video can help.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9i2HAE-ZSw
3	no I feel you 100%. I noticed that I can't seem to look at people when I talk about myself? I think it's just that, or at least for me, I feel like I need to articulate it *perfectly* so that there is no misunderstanding. I try to think of the perfect description or story or whatever, and it's impossible for me to do this while talking. Also, I can't seem to relay my slightest opinions to people I know they won't judge me, not even my choices in TV or music or whatever. Strangely, this doesn't apply when talking to complete strangers when I know they don't really matter (i'll never see them again or they just don't mean much to me yet). I think it has something to do with our tendency to want to get along with absolutely everyone, and our reserved nature, and need to be completely understood.
1	Talking about myself took a lot of time for me to get over. Especially in interviews. Now I have the confidence to talk the whole hour of an interview or panel but it's taken me years to get there. You've basically got to say you don't care a little even though you do care.
1	It's not that I can't talk about myself, I just have very negative opinions about myself overall (my own worst enemy; as this is a stark difference compare to how others describe me.\n\nIt just feels bad man.
5	What advice do you have for someone writing an ISFJ character?	Besides the stereotype, what traits do you think deserve to be seen? What sorts of strengths or weaknesses or misconceptions exist? I would like to gain a more realistic understanding of the mindset so I can do it justice. I love playing with different perspectives.\n\n*****\n\nIf anyone's curious about the character in question, it's for a D&D campaign - a shy elf, a survivor of a largely hunted species in this world. He has grown up alone in an abandoned, overgrown church in a forest, studying old books and relics, and becoming a cleric for a god, too, long forgotten and alone. \n\nServing his god and his friends give him a sense of purpose, as well as stability, protection, and distraction from an underlying fear for his safety.
8	It depends a lot on the context.\n\nSomething written from his point of view (as a main character), in first person, will vary greatly from the way he may be perceived by other characters. ISFJs lead a rich "inner" life, even if they don't show it.\n\nIf you're writing him as a NPC encountered at some point in the campaign, his relationship to the player character(s) matters a lot. He may be just a regular silent figure, wary of others, with a hint of stoicism. He may warm up slowly to others, if they gain his trust. In a closer entourage, he will be loyal and caring and he may seem even a merry and light hearted fellow, always ready to crack a stupid joke. Under pressure or new stressful situations, he could be overly worrying and wishing he hadn't left the comfort of his church's library. Prone to cowardice - I don't see him engaging in perilous adventures for something he doesn't strongly care about.
4	we do lots of little efforts that add up. so we're detail orientated. all of this is internal. look there, check this, check that, does all of that stuff work together?\n\nand we do so with an eye open for group emotional dynamics because we care about people. he/she had this tone or this expression ,what does that mean? and we'll connect that with previous things the person said or expressed that we stored away in our memory to connect and analyze with new things we notice. and the goal is often toward wanting the best for people we care about.\n\nbut yeah, all internal.\n\nwhat comes out are actions that seem to take into account a lot of stuff, it's almost as if we had a big picture view. but it's just because our actions navigated through a sum of tiny things in our minds first.\n\nmany times we are quiet, observant, and thinking, and storing things we notice, and making plans. then we act. and if we get overwhelmed we'll start panicking and either waste time with overplanning, or running in a panicked circle in our minds trying to plan more but getting nowhere, or think we're plan too much and have to go the opposite route and ACT NOW while trying to squeeze in panicked planning as we act.
8	Any ISFJ project managers here?	I'm thinking about switching over to that field from a job that requires quite a bit of abstract thinking. From my past work, I've realized that I enjoy coordinating with people from other teams. Project management seems like a potentially relevant field. What are your experiences like as ISFJ project managers?
5	I am not a project manager but I am a UX designer and I have done some product management.\n\nI talk to a lot of people and have a lot of meetings. Sometimes we have workshops for multiple days. I quickly get drained from the social interaction and that makes me tired and it makes it harder to pay full attention and provide the best input. So I have to take care of planning breaks to recharge. Also my colleagues tend to understand when people get tired and are ok with having breaks or moving productive group work to the next day when the afternoon gets too long.\n\nLeadership in general is not easy and in my opinion is a skill that needs to be developed. I see a lot of people go into management because they have worked in engineering or whatever for a long time and think it is the logical next step. Not everybody should be a manager. Good managers have good empathy (should be fine for ISFJs) but also get comfortable with giving away control. They need to make sure to solve the problems the team has so they can do their job. It is not uncommon that some people start micromanaging. I guess some ISFJs could be a bit on the control freak side..? I know I tend to be like that at least.\n\nAnother thing is getting lost in detail work when it is important to keep track of the bigger picture. That can happen and I need to remind myself. Structure and process helps with that usually.\n\nI would not say that an ISFJ is a bad fit for project management. Keep in mind your weaknesses, account for that and develop your leadership skills. I think it is rarely a bad idea to try these things out, gain some experience and figure out how well it works for you. You can always switch to something else again.
1	I have no idea but I think that you should go ahead and do it regardless of what any of the feedback here tells you. 
1	I'm in the same boat as you. I am waiting to hear back from a company for an interview as PM. 
1	Fellow ISFJ who did a bit of PM!\n\nDisclaimer: my *old* company was a bit unique in terms of culture so take this with a grain of salt.\n\nDid I enjoy it?\nShort answer: no\nLong answer: no because of all the skills I lacked that were important to succeeding in the role. Skills which included leadership, diplomacy and comfort with abstract thought.\n\nYou have to critically reflect upon your skills and traits as to whether or not you can be a good leader, problem solver, and coordinator.\n\nFor me, coordination is my strength but my leadership skills are lacking.\n\nCan you handle having people not be able to meet their deadlines?\nCan you handle things not going as planned?\n\nI worked with a large team with multiple projects running at once. What was challenging for me was **getting others to do their jobs and meeting their specific deadlines**. As an ISFJ, I like things that are in order, organised, and are predictable. To have experienced a lot of roadblocks where issues A, B and C would come up because X, Y, Z didn't meet their deadline or have trouble doing their specific tasks stressed me out.\n\nWe tend to have a lot of empathy for others so a lot of their excuses for not finishing their work would normally "fly by" which to some, might call it being a pushover.\n\nUltimately, the job stressed me out because of a lot of ambiguity and the constant knowledge of knowing that there is something that will always go wrong.\n\nBut like my disclaimer, take everything I said with a grain of salt because how I feel and what I experienced is not completely reflective of what project management is.
7	ISFJ description by Victor Gulenko (Socionics SEI "Dumas")	
5	How does Si manifest in you	After reading Jung's interpretation of Si im rather confused as it is different from what Ive been reading about it so I decided to make this thread.\n\nAdditional questions:\n\nDo Si-doms like daydreaming and how often? If so what would they normally daydream about ( would the daydreams include alternate realities based on real life events with out going over board or could the daydreams include totally fantastical worlds filled with magic and made up creatures etc )?\n\nDo Si-doms take things in face value( I saw someone from a tumblr blog say this and I know i shouldnt take it seriously but i just wanted to make sure )?\n\nDoes strength of imagination correlate with someone's type and if so, how?\n\nIf the previous question is true then what would be the strength of imagination for an Si-dom and how much would they rely on it?\n\nAre Si-doms conformists ?\n\nHow does inferior Ne play a role in the Si-doms life?\n\nDo you normally overthink ,how  and why?
3	These are all just personal answers, I'm not saying this is how all of us are, but for me: \n\n1. Somewhat? I tend to catch myself daydreaming possible conversations with people, or if I'm feeling very anxious I can end up caught in a "what if this terrible thing happens, what would I do" line of thinking. I used to spend a lot of time thinking about books/shows/etc that I consumed and basically writing fanfic in my head lol but it happens a lot less often these days, maybe just because real life is more pressing. \n\n2. I'm not really sure what you mean by this one?? I can find the symbolic meaning in things fairly easily if that's what you're referring to, but I also tend to assume that people are telling me the truth unless I already have a reason to think otherwise?\n\n3. I doubt it. Different function stacks might make people more inclined to use their imagination in different ways, but imagination is pretty difficult to measure, and I'm pretty sure we all use it constantly anyway. \n\n4. For me, Si means I tend to use my imagination to project into the future based on what I've learned and experienced in the past. I might not be as prone to using my imagination for wild flights of fancy as some people, but I use it a lot for visualization and problem solving. I do also like to get into "what if"s when it comes to media, though. I've spent a ton of time in fandom throughout my life and one of my favorite things is just going "what would happen if you put these two characters in a room? How would this group react in this situation?" which is probably a somewhat more traditional application of imagination. But I spend a pretty small percentage of my time just imagining random fantasy worlds or whatever (although that can be a lot of fun, too). I also tend to do more of that type of imaginative work when I have someone else to talk to; it feels more rewarding to have a back and forth exchange of ideas with someone than to just sit and ruminate on my own. \n\n5. No. \n\n6. Mostly I use it for either stress or fun. It gets my anxiety whirring like nobody's business ("what if Dad gets hit by a car while he's riding his bike? What if that tapping noise is something outside the window? What if this dizzy feeling means I'm dying?" etc etc etc), but it also comes into play a lot when I'm having fun, like the fandom "what if"s I mentioned before. \n\n7. Yuuuuup. I think the overthinking tends to come more from my Fe, though? Worrying that I might be annoying someone, how it's going to come off if I say a certain thing, if I've hurt someone's feelings by forgetting to answer their text, if someone will be disappointed in me for not accomplishing a task, that kind of thing. I certainly can and do overthink other areas of my life, but I think that's the type I'm most prone to. As for the why, I've had a number of bad friendship experiences and it's made me very anxious about friendship/close relationships in general, so I put a lot more energy into worrying about it than I should.  
10	How do you want ISFJ to change, so you like them better?	So I've recently went into the MBTI and I enjoy reading about people that indentify themselves with some certain types.\nI've ran into the 'Fuck Marry Kill (MBTI Edition)' thread and I've noticed that ISFJs are the most killable ones out of the types I've checked (ISFJ, ESFJ, ESTP, ISTP, INFJ, INTJ).\nObviously as a isfj, I shouldn't, but I've started worrying. It kind of fits to my recent view how people can like me in general, but my boyfriend (ESTP) is not comfortable with me being close with people.\n\nI'd like you to tell me what could I do to jokingly make myself less 'killable' in the eyes of other people?
14	Be less insecure.
7	My best friend is an isfj, and im an infp.\n\nIn my experience most people have little to no understanding of isfjs, they are maybe the most misunderstood type in mbti. everyone is judging them from an image based solely on stereotypes and when i read most descriptions they are inaccurate by a landslide.\n\nAny qualms i have about her are enneagram related.\nYou guys are great, stay focused on your true identity and not ignorant peoples opinions
6	The moment you change for somebody, is the moment you've lost your own identity.  Keep your integrity.
4	The kindest way I've learned to put it is:\n\nUnderstand that you are great as you are. You have family and friends that care about you. You are someone who dedicates a lot of effort to do things for the benefit of others. And that makes you awesome.\n\nAnd though there is nothing wrong with wanting to improve yourself, understand that all improvements you strive for are just that, improvements. They are extra added onto something already great.\n\nIf we can understand that, we become a lot more tolerable.
3	ENTJ here.  Just ending contact with an ISFJ that had a strong crush on me.  Things could've worked out between us — but she just couldn't be honest with me, she just couldn't stop being manipulative in conversation tipping the topics in my favour just to keep me interested.  She just wouldn't follow up on things she would promise to do with me, she just wouldn't realise my directness informing her to be herself, to be real, that I don't judge…  You guys know the rest.  \n\nYou want to be better?  Talk to people who need direct talk, directly.  Be yourself.  Don't lie for any reason.  I've learned to walk away from SFs in general unless they're very mature.  
6	Stop worrying about stupid internet crap ?\n\nFuck/Marry/Kill is an idiotic sexist impossible choice game. Make a better use of your time by providing to yourself.\n\nOnly then you'll see you weren't even "killable" in the first place.
2	Don't be afraid to stand up for yourself. Also be more confident in who you are and learn to not care about what others think of you. 
2	Isfjs who learn to be honest about how they feel are by far my favorite type like the isfjs I know are usually so obsessed with maintaining harmony that I can't believe that they actually care about me as much as they care about the idea of me not disliking them however the one or two isfjs I can trust are like literally perfect and I love them - random entp guy 
10	How Would You Best Explain And Describe Your Type (ISFJ) To A Person Who Knows Nothing About Myers-Briggs?	No need to be technical.  I just want to know how you perceive yourselves and others specific to this type.  What do you notice that resonates with the ISFJ personality type? Instead of “traits or characteristics” that are so often used within the Myers-Briggs terminology, I would like to hear examples, stories, and/or perspectives you can offer.  I plan on posting this question in each Myers-Briggs specific subreddit to help foster understanding and create insight through first person experiences and perceptions. 
23	In 3 words: Quiet, Loyal, Systematic\n\nQuiet - Obviously most introverts are perceived to be quiet. Generally through a mix of general shyness and not wanting to be a burden or potentially annoy other people if we didnt speak when they didnt need to hear us. If going through stress, anxiety or just trying to avoid conflict or say something negative we don't want to.... expect an ISFJ to clam up even more. \n\nLoyal - For better or worse we really like to stick to/be loyal things we have a emotional connection to. It could be to just a few family/friends you know well,  sticking to a certain few hobbies/restaurants a lot and getting very invested in them, or sticking to a job because you know how to do it and/or you'll feel bad leaving for something else when the people need help. Our past helps defines us very well and we consciously or unconsciously refer to it when doing anything.\n\nSystematic - I don't want to say organized cuz even Judging types can have things like messy rooms. When an ISFJ wants to do something they have a set way with steps and how long it should hopefully take. They are very particular of when to use money, more than most/all types. If something needs to be done if it's not laid out in a way thats easy to understand way or includes some kind of instructions, could throw ISFJ for a loop.
11	Si and sex	Se-users are often described as indulgent and hungry for new experiences but what about Si-users?\n\nWith tertiary Si I can't fully make sense of it but I noticed that I almost never like something (food, music) the first time I try it. Only after processing the new sensations in my mind can I decide that I like it and only after longing for something for a while can I fully enjoy it. I'm careful about new experiences and mostly stay loyal to my favorites. Unlike Se-users I'm quite picky and pay a lot of attention if something feels right or if I should stop because my body isn't really calling for it. But these are only some vague ideas about what could be Si.\n\nWhat do you think is the Si approach to sex and sensual experiences in general?
5	Was I wrong about this ISFJ being interested in me?	I'm an INTJ and I don't usually get the whole flirting thing. So it's especially hard to catch when a girl is flirting with me. So a few months ago a new girl got a job where I work (small pet store) and I was instantly attracted to her. She's really cute but also I tend to be attracted to more caring types and this girl just cares about everything, it was adorable. She's super nice to everyone and just all the great qualities that come with an ISFJ. I always just assumed she was being nice when talking to me and was just one of those types of people that just want to know about people and so they ask you a bunch of questions. Anyways I brushed off a lot of what I know think was flirting, after finding out her type, or at least signs that she liked me. \n   Asking if I wanted to help her restock shelves and the whole time asking me about what I dream about or talking about our personal lives and laughing at really bad jokes and saying how funny I am while calling me a dork or saying how sweet i am.\n   Finding out I've taken LSD and I smoke and then saying multiple times how we should "go halves" and go the beach together. \n    Coming over and asking if I need help with something that's clearly a one person job and admitting it was just an excuse to hang out with me.\n    Mentioning many times that she like my beard or hair and then the last time adding in "I like your face, you're cute."\n    Always asking how I'm doing the first thing when she sees me at work and then the second being "are you closing?" (she always closes).\n    Inviting me over to hang out sending the text at 8pm saying "just finished showering and smoking and and thought of you. I wanted to see if you wanted to come over and hang out, maybe watch some tv or something, i just really need a friend." and then actually telling me to come over at 10pm and then tell me she has to sneak me in. When I get there she says "sorry I'm not cute" while wearing what i can only describe as a lingerie type robe kind of deal (tied) with just the top of a black lace bra showing. Lets me pick a movie and we smoke on her bed while she's laying on her side, so that the curve of her body is accentuated with her "lingerie" draped over her. The movie ends and she says I can put another one on and since we basically just looked at her tumblr and laughed and talked the first movie then it was a good idea. We end up watching a scary movie and shes getting fidgety ie. feet start squirming suspiciously close to mine and hands are doing the same to my hands. she asks if I want to cuddle and then immediately lays her head on my chest and her arm across me to stop on the other half. she then made her body flush with mine draping her leg over my crotch and down my leg and began playing with my beard. \n\nNow until I got to her house I admit I had suspicions but nothing really shot out. When i got there I immediately started to think about reevaluating her feelings for me. (Friends don't usually where what she was wearing as something to hang out in). But it wasn't until I felt the foot wiggles i thought she was into me. then the cuddling and the beard playing basically confirmed everything. \n\nAs an INTJ i dont do intimate situations like that unless I'm prepared. I thought we were friends up until 12:30am that morning so I was extremely nervous and had to concentrate 35% on not getting hard 40% on keeping my heartbeat steady 15% on not getting distracted by her hair smelling nice and then 10% on the actual movie. By this point I was trying not to fuck anything up  and so after the movie ended I left @1:30am.\n\nHer interaction with me definitely changed with me after that. Still asking how i was doing or seeing if i closed but everything else cut back significantly. I can tell when I have to put more effort into a relationship to compensate for the lack of effort from the other party. After I tell her I think i fucked up that night because I'm actually into her she tells me she doesn't like me like that and just wants to be friends. She then pulled away significantly more to the point which I feel like shes avoiding me now. (Could be the copious amounts of hickies on her neck and arms and she doesn't want to make it awkward, but idk). \n   It seemed like she was interested but has now stated 2 times she just wants to be friends (the second being unnecessary) and that shes sorry for the misunderstanding. I'm just really confused but hey thanks for reading this far. any insight would help  
4	Sounds like she likes you and took the initiative to let you know via hints and sexiness. And felt like it wasn't reciprocated in the same fashion of which she's accustomed to. \n\nYou saying you are interested isn't the same to her as you reacting with interest to her cues. And now she feels like she exposed her interest to you and you didn't respond in kind, which hurts, so she's denying initial interest in order to save face.\n\nOr maybe she realized that you aren't who she wanted you to be, someone who can react to her the way she likes. And possibly doesn't want to chase you like before and is backtracking and saying she isn't interested from the beginning to save you face from rejection and save her the discomfort of having to reject you.\n\nCould be one or the other. Probably it's a little of both.
1	Sorry mate it does sound like she's into you 
1	she feels rejected by you. 
10	What do you do for a living?	What is your career/job?  Have you changed careers?\n\nDo you enjoy what you do?
5	I'm in information technology, primarily a system administrator, but also some desktop support. It's definitely a job where you have to get a lot of accumulated experience if you're not an intuit, so my early career was really hard. I felt really stupid and my first manager at my internship was an intuit who got annoyed by me bringing every problem to him asking "Hey, have you seen this issue before? What is the solution?" I thought of switching careers repeatedly, but my first real job was very supportive and didn't make me feel dumb or unsupported while I made mistakes. Now I have 12 years of knowledge and feel really confident about my skills. Once you've got it down, the consistency is nice - Windows Server 2016 is similar to 2012, which was similar to 2008, which was similar to 2003. If I'd tried to go from 2003 to 2016 my brain would have exploded, but tech gives me lots of opportunities to link the new to the past.\n\nI really enjoy it. I initially enjoyed it from an Fe perspective - I loved helping the users in the company, fixing their problems, helping them work better, giving them better equipment. I felt like I had a lot of value enabling the employees to do their best work. Now that I'm older, I value it more for the feelings of competency and accomplishment it provides.
3	Warehouse. I do work with others, but I don't have to talk to them, which is perfect. It's physically demanding, but it pays handsomely. I also work nights, so I rarely ever have to deal with traffic. 
3	In 16 days, I start my new career as a labor and delivery nurse! Before that, I was basically a receptionist. I find nursing to be more fulfilling/satisfying than my past jobs, so I'm really excited. 
3	I'm a teacher. Stereotypical, I know hahaha
1	I recently bought the house cleaning business I worked for so I run that now and I'm studying in my last year of science at uni, I feel like I'll need to do a couple different things part time for a career, I couldn't work in the same place everyday 
1	Office job working with billing stuff
1	I used to be an auto technician, but I left because the field dried up big time. Now I work on trains. I like fixing things.
1	I work in the Quality Control lab at a factory 3rd shift. It's quite and no one really bothers me. Pay is good so it works out. 
1	Currently a product manager for a startup but starting a consulting gig next month! \n\nI don't know what I enjoy yet, I'm young.

1	I'm a sysadmin, provide technical support and training, a supervisor and work on office refit projects.\n\nI enjoy the people. It can definitely be stressful, sometimes, though.\n\nI used to work in hospitality and studied hospitality management. I prefer where I am now, though.
1	Quality Assurance/Food Safety Technician in Food Manufacturing.
1	Retail. I like parts of it, but I hate hard selling.
1	I am a veterinarian but never worked as one (just during my interships in college). I decided to switch career with a master and now I'm finishing my internship in a bioscience laboratory. Now the only animals I work with are the laboratory mice. I'm fine and would like to continue with a PhD (fingers crossed). 
12	Do you ever find yourself becoming easily overwhelmed?	Perhaps this is more anxiety than anything, but does anyone else experience this? 
3	Oh, absolutely. After I start doing said thing, it usually subsides though... Then comes the "making sure it's perfect" aspect of my personality... I don't start a lot of projects just because I know I will drive myself nuts to make sure it's PERFECT in the end.
3	Only like every damn day. I find that I can't trust my gut reaction to anything, because it's almost always too strong. 
2	Everyday :(
9	Understanding the ISFJ Defender!	
3	Some mbti stuff seems accurate and some seems kind of horoscope-y. This was the latter :/ Perhaps because it was so much about the extraverted aspects of isfjs? 
2	Various sections of this ring loud and clear for me!
6	How does inferior Ne cause problems for ISFJs?	For example, inferior Si in ENTPs results in forgetting goals while working towards them, losing track of time and falling out of a routine, and getting obsessed with following a routine that we'll never actually follow - at the expense of doing something more important/interesting and resulting in us just sitting around doing nothing.\n\nNotice how the first two examples are about a lack of Si use, but the last example is about the inferior Si manifesting and being used just enough to avoid picking up a new routine.
6	Mainly thinking about bad scenarios about how everything is going to turn out badly, how everyone has a bad ulterior motives and scheming to hurt you.. something along those lines
2	When things go wrong we try to fix things and inevitably make things worse. Good examples are accidentally being insensitive, then commencing to try and cover it up by comments that only make it worse, ending only when we decide to flee he country and change our name.
3	Music suggestions?	Music tastes have a lot to do with personality, right? So, I'm just wondering if there's any music that you'd think other ISFJ's would like. \n\nI don't get into many bands or artists, but when I do it gets really obsessive. Bands I've obsessed over so far are twenty one pilots, Radiohead, and I'm looking into more! \n\nMaybe music tastes have nothing to do with Myers Briggs personalities, but who knows? Some of us might have quite similar music tastes after all!
4	Mm yeah I don't know that there's much correlation? I listen to a lot of pop and rap for the beats, but I also love classic rock and metal a lot because I grew up listening to them. 
3	I wouldn't say personalities affect music taste. I like mainstream pop and dance, for example :)
2	[deleted]
2	This week I've been listening to the OST from Captain Fantastic. I enjoyed the movie too!
4	Bored and looking to chat with fellow ISFJs!	Just reading/chilling/gaming today.  Shoot me a message!
1	 what games are you playing? 
1	How you doing bro. You play osrs?
5	Unwilling to Facilitate Social Interactions with New People	In the past couple years, I have developed a confidence in my personality after accepting my introversion; I always had thought it was a bad thing.  Not sure if that is relevant to the topic, but maybe it is.\n\nAfter accepting who I am, I've been doing my best to meet new people because I know everyone has something to offer.  My problem is ACTUALLY getting the motivation to open up conversation with people.  I hate small talk, but I know it is necessary to get to more in-depth conversation.  The times that I have great conversation with strangers, I feel fulfilled but the rate I converse with them is sporadic which doesn't lead to consistent increases in conversational skills.\n\nHow do you get motivation to talk to new people and/or create that small talk that is oh-so necessary to go deeper?
3	Try and find something you both have in common and are passionate about as soon as you can. So maybe start off asking about their music tastes, hobbies, etc. Once you find something in common, keep talking about it and let the conversation flow naturally until before you know it - you're talking about a completely different topic. \n\nAlthough it's always very difficult to get into a good conversation with someone who is quite blunt, unwilling to share and doesn't go into detail...
9	Just wanted to share a positive realisation that came from a situation that would normally ruin me.	I just want to share something that has happened to me in the last few days that might be beneficial to other ISFJs here. This post might be a little self-involved but I hope that you all can relate to the situation. \n\nI would say that I am an average male that goes to university, possibly above average looks and not completely socially awkward, so an eligible partner for someone.. somewhere. Anyways, seemingly as a typical ISFJ male, I have not had a wealth of experience with girls, am extremely timid and shy in 50/50 situations I can't envisage the outcome of. I am also self-sabotager when girls show interest who I am not interested in, and feel terrible about it afterwards. In other words, "what are you doing man?", is what I say to myself a lot. I had a few girlfriends when I was at school, however they were more "girlfriends". I could hardly say they were serious.\n\nSo I have pretty much been in love with the same girl for a year, and finally got the courage to ask her out yesterday. She said no, that she liked me as a person etc. Working up the courage to ask her out was difficult enough, but being rejected after putting my whole self on the line was extremely terrifying as an experience. As one would naturally expect, I was crushed and cried myself to sleep, wallowing in self pity (haha).\n\nSo she is my co-worker and today I knew I would be around her at work and I assumed my world was about to crumble. I promised to myself I would at least be brave upon first interaction. I have no idea when or how this happened, but the moment I said hi to her, I did not sink into myself but rather owned the person who I am. It was like I matured instantly. I was not awkward and didn't actively avoid her, which was definitely something I thought would happen to me in the past. Although the pain of rejection hurts, I don't feel like I am the one with the problem (not totally, though) and even going so far to think that maybe she might have missed out on me. I've not really felt this confident in a long time.. which is completely strange as I thought I would be in the dumps for weeks.\n\nI'm not sure what I actually meant with this post, but just wanted to share it anyways. So all of you tentative ISFJs, I say seize the moment. Do not be like me and wait a year to ask someone out, because you may be holding your own self back. The asking wasn't even that bad! It was slightly exhilarating. Now of course it is not all blue skies ahead, I will probably feel sad about this in the near future.. but at least I know that there were some positives to come from this otherwise bleak situation.\n\ntl;dr: feel weirdly refreshed and confident after being rejected from someone I was in love with. Gonna be sad at some points but mainly surprised and happy I have grown from this situation.
3	I can completely relate to this post, thank you for sharing it! It takes so much for us to build up the courage to actually ask someone or to genuinely tell them how we feel which is why it hurts us so much if they decline. The immediate aftermath hurts, and hurts hard, but as long as you don't lull over 'what could have been' forever, then everything gets easier.\n\nI also think self-esteem is important too because if you thought you were the problem it'd take longer to get over her. But since you are happy with your looks, social skills, etc. you accepted that it's her loss rather than something wrong with you.\n\nGood luck out there, keep your chin up :)\n

-1	I am sure she sensed the hesitation.  And you did a bad thing by asking a co-worker out! Glad it is working out, though
3	Heey we're a [Discord] that is associated with socionics/mbti.	We're a mix MBTI and socionics discord but people here usually talk about socionics, what follows is philosophy, politics and other typology theories.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/nuCbHkJ\n\nOnce you join do say hi or introduce yourself. We're friendly here, we like new people :]\n
2	Sounds like a central hub for huge disagreements and arguments to me :P
7	I (INFP female) told my crush (ISFJ male) that I like him romantically and now he won't talk to me.	We had been friends for a couple years and got pretty close the last few months. We were both pretty much loners and bonded more whem we both lost our jobs. \n\nI swear he had romantic feelings for me too, there were little signs. Everyone I talked to agreed that these were probably signs of romantic interest. So I opened myself up, very scary for me because I didnt want to lose him as a friend. And now won't talk to me.\n\nI understand if he changed his mind or even never felt that way at all about me. But why wouldn't he just say that instead of shutting me out? Is there a chance that I did something else completely unrrlated to make him hate me and he just used this as a reason of sorts to finish off our friendship?\n\nI know no one else can say whats in another person's head, but I've got no where else to turn. I lost my best friend in this and all I know is that he might have a hard time expressing his emotions. I dont know if there is something I can do to help or not. \n\nAs much as I hate this for myself, I hate to think i am the cause of him toiling away inside his own head. I've seen how badly it effects him when someone close to him did some really shitty things. In a way i hope he's just decided to hate me and move on, just so he won't be tortured in his own head. \n\nI dont know what I'm asking for here, but thanks for listening.
14	I'm a little sleep deprived so I'm not going to try and give you any deep and insightful advice, but I will say that as an ISFJ, I can be very avoidant. If I don't know how to handle something without hurting feelings, or if I feel there's potential for conflict and I'm in a place where I can't handle confronting that anxiety, I sometimes just avoid dealing with things at all costs. There have been times when I've avoided speaking to my best friend for weeks because I've felt like I haven't been a good enough friend and can't stand the guilt and anxiety. It's a totally counterproductive impulse, but not everyone copes well :P \n\nAs you've said though, it's impossible to know what's really going on with him unless you ask and he tells you. Whatever the cause, I'm really sorry that you're having to deal with this :( It sounds really heartbreaking, so I hope you're able to talk things out with him and figure out what's going on, or at the very least recover well and quickly💕\n\nEdit: A word

2	My husband is ISFJ, and he told me he liked me as just a friend multiple times haha. I was persistent though, and we've been happily married for 7 years now. If you think he's the one, prove it to him. :)
3	Confused about si and type?!	Im not sure of my type . I think I'm either an infj/infp/isfj. I really relate to the si function. I'm not sure what si really is other than that I've heard it's about taking in a sensory feeling based on how it affects you and I feel like I'm really like this .  I really take in physical feelings and am kind of scared to experience new ones . I also sometimes have a hard time describing how sensory things make me feel.\nI'm also quite hypersensitive and hypochondriacish .  Can any of you help me out in figuring out more?
3	Si, to the best of my personal understanding, is basically just taking past experiences and knowledge and using that to inform your understanding of situations and create projections for the future. For example, that's where the idea of Si-doms preferring routine comes from; in theory, it's less stressful for us to be in situations that we have a thorough understanding of, so routine is comforting. New situations, on the other hand, are more likely to stress us out, especially if we're in them alone. That's because we don't have a model yet for what the appropriate course of action is, and if we're by ourselves, we don't even have anyone's lead to follow. While it's not always true, in general I think that tends to be uncomfortable for us, as it makes it very difficult for us to use our dominant function. \n\nSi is also good for comparing data; we can be very good at figuring out what's not working in a system, what the best solution to a similar problem in the past has been and thus what might work in the present, noticing changes in how our environments and bodies feel, etc. For me, it ended up making me very good in school, because it was easy for me to make connections between various topics and subjects based on what I already knew, which helped me both integrate what I was learning as well as pull from my pool of prior data to produce new ideas about a topic from different perspectives. \n\nThere are stereotypes that it means having a great memory/always remembering important details, or always sticking to tradition/following rules, but that's not really true. In some cases it may be, but I'm an ISFJ and I don't have any of those qualities lol. So don't let that kind of description throw you off. \n\nIn general, I think the easiest way to think of it is that Si users take concrete personal experience or learning, and then use that as data to help filter and contextualize new information as it comes in. It comes with upsides and downsides like any other function, but that's the best description I can personally give you. 
2	Si is very difficult to describe, since it is an irrational function (just as Ni). If you're a Si dom, you're probably using it so much that you don't even notice it. Sometimes people might even confuse it with Ni based on some descriptions they read. "Yeah, sometimes I just know things, it must be my intuition". Those unconscious strong feelings you might have towards some things might as well be rooted in your experience and not your intuition.\n\nSi is stereotypically associated with having a good memory. While this is just a stereotype, if you notice you often remember an event in greater detail than a non-Si dom friend, this might be a hint you use Si. I do this a lot with my friends - they tend to remember just a general outline, while I can remember a lot of vivid, sensorial details. This memory thing is even more noticeable if you're stuck in a Si-Ti loop, like I am (lots of recollecting of painful memories and overthinking things and finding excuses). However, if you don't care enough about certain things, you will forget them, just like everyone else.\n\nWhen you're explaining stuff, do you often find it easier to resort to examples, personal experiences or anecdotes? If yes, that's another hint you might be using Si.\n\nA general preference for comfortable familiarity, like /u/lemontongues described it, is another hint in this direction.\n\nEmphasis here is on "hints" - these don't necessarily prove or disprove you're a Si dom. We're different, after all, and self-perception is often biased. Keep reading on this topic and analyze your daily life. If you really use it, in time you will start to feel Si's presence everywhere.\n\nAnd of course, this solves just the ISFJ vs INFJ question. INFPs also use Si, but it's easier to determine whether you have Fe or Fi.\n
1	I think I do use si from what all of you explained but I believe that it might not be my dominant function. I'm good with memory and recall even during exams but I kind of also suck at it where I'm like "okay but wait that happend?" Like I forget certain life experiences and then am like OMG when will I learn lol but I always tell my self that I should remember such things for the future . \n\nIn a way I noticed using si is kind of painful to me but I also like using it . 
5	ISFJ female and ESFP male relationship	Can someone tell me their experience of dating an ESFP? Because I have been reading numerous posts saying that this wouldn't work out. \nI've only been messaging the guy because its a long distance relationship however we are planning to meet, but I just want to know from other people's stories, what its like to date an ESFP? and whether it can last? ( I know everyones different but It would be nice to hear other stories just as a heads up). \n
3	First of all, forget every stereotype or prejudice that you've read. Any relationship between any personality can work!\n\nI've had no experience with an ESFP, but I have a similar experience. I used to despise INTJs for how blunt, cold and arrogant they can be online - and then I actually met an INTJ, got to know them better and now my perception has changed entirely. \n\nYou clearly both like each other, so if you do decide to meet each other, I hope you have an amazing time :)
1	I disagree. I am an ISFJ, where my boyfriend (over 2 year relationship) is an ESTP. He is not a very strong 'T' so once over 3 times he did the test it came out ESFP. \nWe are great together, nobody thought we will. We often disagree, but we find the things we lack in one another.\nAccording to some strange info graphics I've found 3 days ago ISFJ would find a great much in ESTP or ESFP! I don't take it too seriously, but it is funny how I fit into that assumption.\n\nFor sure you shouldn't look at what the internet says about going along with a certain type. I think my boyfriend gives me a reality check when I am going too much into helping others or when it comes to underestimating myself.\nIn addition my boyfriend is from a different country what would maybe make it harder to manage, but it seems out types go along well enough!\n\nAlso, my best friend that I currently live with is a ESFP female and I know her since we are 3 and 5 years old, so I think the types match well :D
10	I wish I wasn't is isfj!	So I've taken the test many times and it never deviates. I am an extremely caring person, go out of my way to make everyone smile and be happy, always want everyone to have a good time etc. etc. The problem is recently I started reading about incurable brain tumors in children (summer project for class next year) and I feel like it is contributing to my depression. I just feel an overwhelming amount of sympathy, why them, it's not fair, feel bad for the families, and on and on. Its not really normal as I've never met these kids. Like I will think about them multiple times a day and almost cry because I feel so bad for them and I feel helpless in the situation. Like I just wish I could fix it. I guess my question is how do I turn this off and not get so emotionally envolved? It's strange I don't really cry during movies bc I am able to see that it is fake, but anything like this in real life I clearly don't handle well...
6	Look into other awful things in the world that also effect you to this level. Find so many that you have to force yourself to realize that there is no true fairness in nature or the world. And realize that we can only do the good we can everyday. \n\nCollectively we can make the world better and maybe even fair where we are able to. But we can't expect fairness to come out of nowhere.\n\nSome kids are brought into the world having happy loving parents. Some into abusive households. Some born horribly sick. Some born a little different from societal norms. Some born having advantageous genetics to society's standards. Many born into countries that take advantage of their citizens or into slavery.\n\nPlace hope in the change you can do and the change people strive for. See that our literacy rate is higher world wide than ever before, starvation/death by dehydration is a world wide low, wars is also at an all time low, education is at an all time high, life expectancy is at an all time high. And understand that people have been working together, slowly trying to make things better throughout history. And try to be a part of that. And find peace in that hope.
6	Find a reputable cancer research charity and set up a monthly donation. Sure it's still sad but you'll at least feel as if you're contributing and trying to solve the problem. It will take a little bit of it off your shoulders. 
2	Maybe you should volunteer at an organization that helps children with cancer.\n\nSide note: I once watched someone die on the side of the road and I couldn't help them because I didn't know CPR. Instead of feeling sad I decided I was going to change my life to do something about it, so the very next day I decided to become an EMT. I now know CPR and I get to save people on a regular basis.
1	Its probably not your personality type, its that you're a deeply caring person. I do the same things, more like try to completely avoid painful things and I'm not isfj. \n\nBut I'm sorry i dont have a solution. I just dont think you should wish you were something you're not. But i do understand that it's painful.
1	Take the way it makes you feel and use that as fuel to change it, that's what I'm doing with all the BS that's going on in the world right now. And yeah, I'm not able to make HUGE strides to where I want to be in terms of my effectiveness on the world, but at least I'm doing something.
1	Volunteer at a local hospital and watch people heal. If you are younger, you might consider going to college for nursing. A lot of nurses are ISFJs and you will be in great company and understood. You could get a letter of recommendation and scholarships for volunteering your time and actually using your summer to get ahead. Good luck. 
9	Did anyone else find their personality type changed to ISFJ from another personality type after being diagnosed with anxiety or depression?	
7	Before being treated well for my bipolar, I was solid INFP. Now that my mental health is in good shape, I'm definitely ISFJ.
3	I constantly tested as an ISTJ until Prozac. Since then I've consistently been ISFJ. 
2	Yes! I changed from ISFP to ISFJ and I didn't even make the connection that I had started taking anti-depressants. Interesting!
2	I guess I explored different types, many of them while I was suffering from depression, but now I'm out of it I'm definitely ISFJ. There were times that I could be mistaken for an INFJ or ENTP though.
2	I actually used to test as enfp when I was like 18 when I first tested but since then I've been through so much developed an anxiety disorder and now test as isfj or infj/infp. Which is interesting 
1	Well, the past couple of years I've done some serious self-improvement work (mindfulness, self-exposure) and I went from INTJ to ISFx. Pretty sure I've suffered from mild depression and anxiety most of my life but now it's almost gone.
1	I have been doing some soul-searching as of late also and I just tested INFP now but I have been ISFJ for awhile.\n\nI guess anyone's personality can change based on circumstances ?
1	I may have gone through a depressive (to this day I'm not quite sure what to call it) period where I ended up changing from ESFJ to ISFJ. Not a huge change, I know, but I went from being outgoing and bouncy to everyone to being pretty shy and quiet unless I was with my friends. 
1	I know I'm late to this post but I'll be honest - I don't think this is actually possible. The types are supposed to be consistent throughout your life, they're just expressed differently as you get older. Mental illness of course also plays an effect on how your type gets expressed - likely in ways that seem to run counter to what your type actually is. So if you really believe that you've somehow changed types, chances are, you have just always been wrong about your type. The cognitive functions you use and the order you use them in don't just spontaneously change. I've had anxiety and depression for a long time and I never thought I was an ISFJ before, but after understanding how function theory works, I realized that I was in a deep Si-Ti loop the entire time; I was ALWAYS an ISFJ. So I'd advise actually trying to understand the functions and see if there's a combination of them that would work to describe you at both points in your life. 
16	any isfj males who struggle to get a girlfriend? how do you meet new women and convey your intentions?	
7	this is really hard to explain and i think a good answer requires me to have a deeper understanding of myself. so here is my best-i-can-do answer.\n\nall i know is that i meet new people at parties or social gatherings. and always start new interactions with people with the intention of friendship. and that friendship can progress to "i feel excited to spend time with this person" and that leads to me asking them out on a date.
5	Is it worth saying dont be afraid to be a bid more bold? It is my understanding that isfj's have trouble showing and/or vocalizing feelings. Sometimes that is all it takes is to speak up. \n\nI almost hate to say that because i find your shyness endearing and real. But not everyone is like me so...
7	Relationship duration + personal impact	During this past month, a 5-month relationship ended with an ENFP on her terms. We had known each other for 8-months, and before the relationship, we would always skype in the morning and at night. We would be constantly in contact throughout the day, and as such, we were pretty close when we began the relationship. We both confessed our love for each other within the first couple months of the 'official relationship.'\n\nFor me to openly confess my emotions, I need to feel safe and cared for by the other person. I need to feel like the two of us can work through whatever life throws at us (and we did at times), so when the relationship ended so soon, it really hit me hard. I actually felt worse from this relationship ending than my previous 5-year relationship.\n\nIt made me think about the impact of duration of relationships and what it actually means afterward. For me, when I fall in love with someone, there will always be a part of me who will love the person in the future -- who will wish the best for them, even if the relationship ended on bad terms -- but I do not know if I can really be friends anymore. It also takes me a long time to get over it, and I will always look at 'what could I have done better?'\n\nSo fellow ISFJs:\nWhen do you usually feel comfortable telling people you love them?\nHow hard do break ups hit you, even if they're short? What is short, in this instance?\nHow long does it take you recover and bounce back?\nWould you ever want to be friends again? Do you end up being friends again?
2	Hmm, it usually takes a while I guess? I try not to be too reserved about it, but to really feel that comfortable and get to that level of affection for someone I'd say it takes at least 6 months to a year. \n\nReally depends on the breakup. If I've only been dating someone for a little while, like less than 6 months I guess, and I've found that I'm not actually that attached to them, I'm emotionally over it pretty much immediately even if I still spend a while thinking about it, not much impact at all. \n\nFor my longest and most intense relationship, we broke up about two years ago and I still don't think I'm fully recovered even though it doesn't really hurt on a day to day basis at this point. It was compounded by a few issues with friendships around the same time, so it had a huge impact on my confidence and self-esteem and hit me really really hard. The effects are still lingering because I sort of repressed everything and focused on moving on before actually dealing with my feelings about it. \n\nI almost never want to be friends with someone after a breakup, especially if it doesn't end well. I could imagine situations in which I would be okay with it if it were a very amicable breakup, but for the most part once I'm done with you, I'm done for good. I see too many people wasting their time dealing with exes they don't even really like, and I can't stand the thought of that being me; if we broke up, it was probably for a reason, and it probably means I don't want to be spending time with you at all. 
1	In my case it takes around a year to recover from a break up, but it can be easier and shorter if you find a new partner. I've never ended up being friends again with an ex girlfriend. We are not enemies either, we just lost contact.
8	ISFJs, I have a self-care app prototype I want to show you!	I've been designing a self-care app for FJ types, and I've just finished a prototype. I'm looking for folks that could user test for me today. Participating is very easy, and I would greatly appreciate your input.\n\nReply to this thread or message me if you're interested in checking out what I've been working on!
2	so what is a self-care app? what does it do?
1	me! me! me!
1	Interested!
1	I've got time now if you want! 
1	Oh! Me, please!!!!
1	If you are still looking for people, I'm interested! 
1	I'd be keen to give it a go.
1	I'd love to try if you're still testing
1	Also interested! Let me know.
8	How do I get better about reading social situations?	I am incredibly dense. I know I annoy my ENTP brother and INTJ father at how socially dense I am. I just don't understand what to do. I often do/say stupid and/or embarrassing stuff without meaning to. How do I get better about knowing what is appropriate to say/do? I'm often told to take more initiative, yet when I do, I go about it wrong. What is the right way to do it? Please help. 
3	I learned by just observing a lot. \n\nAfter observing a lot of different social situations, you tend to get a sense of the pattern of how people tend to act or respond in different situations, and then you can act accordingly.\n\nSo just a lot of watching and active listening. \n\n
2	a lot of that is confidence. Every day, instead of ruminating on how "stupid" or "annoying" and playing the mental tape of your father or brothers annoyance with you, do a mental review with notes for next time. Sometimes in the midst we experience a disconnect from brain to mouth. having self-coached responses may help. This works for reviewing most mistakes or embarassing situations.
3	Public Displays of Affection	Yes? No? Maybe? What do you all feel about that? I'm very open to it (not the out right sex acts in public) but general peck kisses and holding hands or touching the back or arm or shoulder. Even saying 'I love you.' Just curious what you all feel about it. (Me=INFP for reference.)
9	As long as it stays to that kind of innocent touching, 10000%. If it goes beyond that it makes me wildly uncomfortable, because I hate seeing other people make out in public and don't want to inflict that on anyone else :P Generally I'm extremely touchy feely though, so any time I can finagle some physical contact, I'm happy. 
6	ISFJ (f) I LIVE for PDA. I must be touching my INTP at all time. It is shocking to me that he isn't overwhelmed by my unquenchable need for affection. When we were first dating I was very distant from affection -because for me I feel loved and valued through touch, and having dated so many ass hats, I realized if I removed affection I could see a bit more clear. Although, through our relationship my INTP was always affectionate and didn't even register that affection -touching my knee, holding my hand- was only when he made the first move. 3 years later, we are still like 12 year olds constantly all over each other and inseparable. 
3	I absolutely love PDA as well. It makes me feel really good about myself to know that my partner isn't ashamed or whatever to be with me and wants to show the world that I am their girlfriend. Physical touch is second on my love language list, so naturally I gravitate towards touching my partner more because that's what I want as well. 
3	Yes. Very much yes.  I'm pro pecks, holding hands, other and nice innocent touches.\n\n1) I don't like holding back affectionate things i want to express.\n\n2) feels good to know my partner is openly affectionate of me as well.\n\nI'm kind of a corny romantic person about it all. Little things like this have me over the moon. Once a girl I just started seeing saved a seat for me at an event. I had the biggest smile that lasted throughout the day.
3	Yo, as an ISTJ female dating an ISFJ male - this is super accurate and explains a lot. Your responses are incredibly helpful. Also makes me feel odd for having a totally different love language (acts of service is my ultimate weakness).
3	PDA is much appreciated! I don't think it weird and I hope for it! Cheers!
2	I am extremely physical affectionate but I'm not comfortable AT ALL with it in public. Maybe hand-holding, or leaning against each other, I suppose, but anything more than that just makes me anxious. \n\n
7	Why dont ISFJs ask questions?	Okay, the title is a bit misleading. I'm mainly hoping for some insight about my ex who is an ISFJ.\n\nSo often times when I would talk about an interesting experience or thought I had or something I emotionally was going through, he would barely ask me follow up questions. I often felt like I was talking to a wall. I felt neglected. I would have to say things like "Yeah....so are you going to ask me what I mean?" Or "So are you gonna ask me for more details on what happened or not?" And when I said this, 1 of 2 things would happen:\n\n1) He would ask a question just for the sake of asking it, AFTER I mentioned it. It would also be something along the lines of "Oh Im sorry. So yeah tell me more about it I'd like to know" To which I'd say "More about what exactly? What do you want to know?" because I could sense that he was just grasping at straws :/\n\nor 2) He would go into defense mode, getting offended and saying that he was going to ask or that he was listening or that he didnt know I wanted him to ask or something of that sort, to which I would proceed to explain my feelings but instead of realizing it was something that hurts me it would just turn into a big argument because I guess he either got annoyed or felt bad about himself for not being able to (I actually don't know, any ideas?)\n\nSo my question is, are ISFJs generally like this? Do you guys find it hard to come up with questions? Are you guys generally minimal conversationalists? And if so, why? If not, why was my ex like this? I know that some of the topics I'd talk about weren't his forte so instead he'd just like listening to me. But I didnt always want a sounding board as much as I wanted a conversational partner who would catch my drift, get on my wavelength, you know what I'm saying? I just feel really bad looking back and realizing there were so many moments such as these. I was left to assume that he just doesnt care and is pretending, which I know was probably not the case.\n\nAnother thing that'd happen a lot is that I would tell him to talk to me about something because it would always feel like I was bringing up the topics. And he'd just tell me some sensory details of what happened during his day or something about sports, which wasnt what I was looking for. In the end, both parties just end up feeling bad. \n\ndisclaimer: it wasnt ALWAYS like this. there were times when he was very attentive, curious, analytic even. there were also times where he would bring up cool things to talk about. it was never like suuuper deep and crazy, but still satiated me.

9	Well this got a little long lol, but I have a couple of thoughts, just pulling from my own experiences. Hopefully they'll be helpful? \n\n1) Social awkwardness/self-consciousness and the fact that we're introverts. It can be difficult and tiring to keep up with a conversation where I'm not sure what the appropriate reaction is (thank you, dominant Si), and in an emotional situation, I get very worried about saying the wrong thing and upsetting or annoying someone. Plus, sometimes I just get tired of talking, full stop. \n\n2) Coming up with questions for someone just isn't really where my mind goes in a conversation. I tend to put my focus on making sure the other person feels comfortable and cared for, and is receiving signals that I'm listening to what they're saying/feel sympathy/etc. Questions might come up in some cases, but it wouldn't necessarily occur to me that they would want me to coax answers out of them or that they would be presenting a topic that they wanted me to examine and discuss rather than just telling me their thoughts. \n\n3) We're usually not good when put on the spot (again, thanks dominant Si). If someone asked me to ask them questions or talk to them about something interesting, I would honestly probably just stare at them. I would feel really off-put and unsure, because half the time my mind just blanks, but also how am I supposed to know what you want from me? What if I ask a question and you think it's dumb, or I bring up a topic that you find boring? For me that would just be kind of weird and embarrassing and feel very forced. \n\n4) I just don't think we tend to express our affection that way. To me, constantly having to have "deep" or "interesting" conversations would feel really superficial and like we were trying too hard. If something comes up organically, great, but that's not what's important to me in a relationship at all. I want to be able to talk about mundane things and still be invested enough to want to hear what the other person has to say, but also to be comfortable enough with each other that we don't have to fill the silence all the time. \n\nOverall though, I think you guys were probably just not on the same wavelength about what "care" looks like. To you it's obviously being very conversationally active and generating topics to discuss or contributing questions/ideas, while he may have found that difficult or thought it expressed his care best to listen quietly and just let you vent. I can't say for sure of course, but it seems like a case of you guys just not always connecting on a communicative level. 
6	>So my question is, are ISFJs generally like this?\n\n\nYes, oh my god yes.\nSpeaking from my personal experience, we're just not good at it. We listen and absorb and sympathize and appreciate the experience you extroverts talk about, but it's just not easy for us to come up with things to say.\nNo need to feel bad though, ISFJs are really good listeners and he probably understands what you're talking about most of the time. \n\nPlease be more patient and try to understand when he's searching for a way to convey his feelings into words.
4	I'm not like this. I ask questions and dive deep into conversations because that the way I feel close to people sometimes. I did grow up in a house with all girls though so that may have contributed. And I also grew up in a home where I saw the lack of communication and interest drove my mom to depression and eventually divorce so I promised myself I would be way way more open and honest. It's been a journey but I feel like it's natural to me now. 
3	It seems pretty clear that you both as part of the relationship are needing to do non-preferred communication. You talk about wanting him to ask more questions about things while at the same time dismissing him when he talks in sensory.\n\nIt sounds like it's a breakdown of the relationship coming from neither side getting what they need in terms of communication.\n\nISFJs do ask questions and do all the normal things, but if we're in a relationship where our basic needs aren't being validated, we're likely to withdraw....
5	Do ISFJs enjoy weed? Why or why not?	Any ISFJs out there enjoy smoking weed? If so, why? What about it do you like and how does it make you feel? How often do you do it, in what situations, etc.\n\nIf not, why not? How did it make you feel and why didnt you like it?\n\nMy ex was ISFJ (I'm an INFJ) and I would smoke around him quite a few times as I like to smoke. It's something that means a lot to me and I wanted him to experience it and see if he liked it, and I wanted him to try it with me since he was comfortable around me. However, I think he felt that I was pressuring him when really I just wanted to have an open conversation about WHY or WHY NOT he didn't want to, so I could address any concerns he had. It was hard for him to have this conversation because he just ended up feeling bad. Anyway, he agreed he wanted to try it with me and I was planning how and where it would be to ensure him to have the best experience...but we never got around to it and he would never actually bring it up, so I felt like it didn't really appeal to him which was upsetting. I confronted him about it, and he said that he DID want to try it but that he wasn't dying to. I know he liked drinking though because it was more of an acceptable thing and it made him more outgoing. Just trying to gain insight...
9	After seeig what it does to people and getting a small whiff of it during high school\n\nI dont want to
6	Hi, I think I can't speak for all ISFJs but I enjoy weed the most if I don't have to do anything after. It makes me relaxed and a little bit tired. That's why I usually smoke/vape in the evening with my friends. I started it at 18 because I was curious since I've been younger and only then got my first connection. With weed I have got more control over myself than with alcohol. One thing I don't like, is being high in public (ok, maybe with sunglasses). I now am 21 and know a lot of great people who smoke weed and the world kind of changes when you realize just how many people smoke in such a small distance and how relatively normal it has become (although most parents still don't like to hear about it). I live in a rural area in Austria by the way.
5	I love weed. I usually prefer smoking it alone at home, usually it allows me to feel REALLY relaxed and without worries. Also, I enjoy the plus of creativity I get with weed, it takes my mind out of the little daily things I usually focus on, and let me think about more abstract things? I don't know. \nI also like to smoke it outside in a bright day, with a blue sky and people wandering on the streets. I love to observe everything and it gives me a sense of belonging and amazement for the world, and humanity, and everything! It changes my sometimes pessimist perspective of things. I have to be cautious to not be very dependant of weed though. I enjoy it too much :'). \n\nI have to add sometimes I can have a slightly bad trip, because weed can increase my focus in my anxieties, or if I am outside, I can be obsessed that people is looking at me and judging me.. I don' t know if it is a usual thing!  But normally I enjoy it\n
4	For me, I'm just nervous to do so because I never have before. I guess I worry and bout being laughed at or something and I didn't want to become like the "potheads" at my school. I'm 18 but I still feel younger and so it feels like something I shouldn't do for my age. Like it felt wrong. But idk how I would feel now in a situation where someone asks me to smoke. I've only ever eaten a pot brownie but there wasn't much in it so I didnt really feel anything, just kinda relaxed. But before eating it, I was feeling nervous. I suppose I just felt like I was being pressured to do it, and I HATE being pressured because it makes me really anxious and I freak out.
3	I think this has more to do with upbringing and entourage than with types, to be honest.\n\nISFJs that grew up sheltered, with no 'cool' friends might be less open to this experience. I have no problem with it, although I kind of dislike the 'dude weed lmao' culture. I was introduced to it by my close friends, who were mature enough to trust. Although I was a little nervous before trying it for the first time, I enjoy it a lot.\n\nI'm not doing it on a regular basis, since I don't know any dealers personally. I smoke when I reunite with my old friends and they have some ready. It's the social aspect that makes it really enjoyable. I don't think I'd like to do it regularly in solitude. \n\nFrom an ISFJ point of view, I like it because it allows my Ne silliness to surface without feeling inappropriate/retarded. And sometimes it interacts in a funny way with my Si. I remember getting high with a friend at his place - we were really baked and went to sleep. 10 sec after turning off the lights, I would start remembering the stupidest things and start laughing in the dark. And then I was thinking how silly I am to laugh like this, and laugh harder, pulling the covers over my head. Then stopping for 5 seconds and remembering another thing - and my friend muttering "oh, for fuck's sake!". 
2	Hey I like weed. Weed helps me relax and enjoy the moment. I smoke it both alone and with friends. It's great because it helps me enjoy the moment for a little bit and not have to worry about little things. Best thing about weed is that it's reportedly the least harmful drug even less than alcohol. I also like how it is a huge stress reliver for me. I think it's common for ISFJs to be opposed to things like weed that are "socially unacceptable". But at least here in California it's legal and I feel comfortable doing it. Overall, Weed is my favorite drug. 
1	I do not like smoking it.  If I have the tiniest bit of edibles, though, it is a ton more enjoyable.  I get in my head too much when I am too high (which isn't difficult).
3	Any ISFJs here been in a long-term relationship with an ENTP?	If so, how did it work out? What were the things they did to make it worthwhile? What were the struggles and how did you overcome them? 
3	Is an ISFJ in a long term with an INTP, so not exactly the same but similar. It's working out really well. we have been together 3 years, and are planning to get married. Our relationship is freaking phenomenal, but we do have our drawbacks both being introverts. We struggle with going out often since we like being inside. We compliment each other so well because my INTP will think things through in ways I never even considered, he helps me live in the moment, relax and is beyond patient with me especially when I wind myself up and over think the future. One of our main struggles is that is isn't the most driven person. He is great about putting in the mental energy but often I'm doing a lot of the physical work. He has grown a lot and is willing to help me and not let me do everything. I love is silly sense of humor and how we rarely ever have any issues. Even when we have disagreements, we are able to talk through them and work through things. One of the biggest things I learned in my relationship with him is if it's not a deal breaker, don't give him a hard time, he will step up to bat and be the man I need him, but if I demand him to do things it's never going to happen. I don't know if that is helpful or not. 
2	I'm married to one! We've been together for 18+ years and married for 15 years as of June 1st. He just understands me and I understand him. He brings me out of my shell just enough and I keep him balanced, I think. It's never really felt difficult to me but we've been together since I was 17 and he was 18 so we kind of grew up and learned how to adult together. =)
2	ISFJ and ENTP are in ["duality" relations](http://personalitycafe.com/isfj-articles/285-love-types-isfj-5.html#post4235430) according to socionics, which is ideal match by jungian type that offers greatest support and understanding for both people involved. Individual traits will vary, of course, but as far as MBTI types go the light cannot get more greener than with this match (INTP is another great type pairing).
1	I've been 7 years with my ENTP SO and we work really well together. It has not been always like that, we have had some issues, mainly about how we communicate things and some insecurities of mine. But after 7 years we understand each other really well,  share a lot of hobbies and have similar visions of life. Our little disagreements now are mainly about housekeeping, I do most of the tasks and he is a mess with his stuff. But we have no major discussions. I admire and have learnt from some of his qualities and I think I can say the same the other way around. 
1	I dated an ENTP, and at first for the few month of the relationship, it was amazing, we both couldnt get enough of each other. But then slowly, he started becoming distant, ENTP's enjoy their space and prefer to be alone sometimes and value this a lot, and I really failed to try and give him this, I just wanted to spend so much time with him together. However, I could definitely look back and see that this played a huge factor into why we could not be together. I also find that with ENTP's they struggle to be affectionate, I enjoyed helping him out wherever possible, trying my outmost best to give him whatever he desired (As weird as that sounds) but I personally didnt feel I was getting the same back. I remember I kept using the word 'deserve', and he hated it. I also dont like people who dont stick to their word on things, and many times he would say one thing to me but then not attempt to try and achieve it (even though he had the capacity and time to do so). \n\nCommunication is so key! At first, I would not tell him when I was upset and assumed he could tell however ENTP's are terrible at reading body language and would rather much prefer you to tell them, be open and immediately inform them when you feel sad or down because waiting around for them to realise might require a few years. \nAhaha, hope this helps. \n\nBut bear in mind, if an ENTP's really into you, he will be willing to change, adapt himself and help you. I found specifically with my ex, he didnt at all help me reach my full potential in fact quite the opposite, I felt like I became less like my self around him and took on negative characteristics. 
7	How do I know if and ISFJ is interested in me romantically?	You all are so cordial and wonderful to friends and family. I have have had some signs that my crush (an ISFJ) is maybe interested in me romantically, but it could also just be how you are all such wonderful at making people feel comfortable and at home. Are there any specific clues when feelings pass that friendship / romantic interest line?\n\nTo add more detail: he's told me i am a true friend and he loves me for it. We have been camping together, when i say love me or leave me, he replies he's not left. I've spent the night at his house and he said he was glad i felt comfortable enough to do it. And we hug often. He has even talked about us living together, but also later said that i would be fine living alone when i have expressed that i dont believe i ever could live alone. But then it seems like there is a wall up, that things are only to go so far, and no more. Is that his shyness or is that the friendship line that i shouldnt cross? I dont want to jeopardize our friendship, but hes the only guy I've felt i can depend on and so serious about. The thought of "the rest of my life commitment" doesnt scare the crap out of me with him.\n\nAlso, I am not sure I am his type. I'm kinda messy and and INFP. More on the dreamy, illogical side. But there have been what, the intuitive side of me, would call signs of a romantic interest from him. But my intuition isn't always correct. So I'm asking all you wonderfully grounded people for advice.

3	Hello	Hey Isfj's, i'm an ENTJ, kinda curios about you guys since i've never met anyone of your type, would love to get to know any of you if you're interested.
5	We're just people, just like anyone else. Nothing so special about us :)
2	You've never meet an ISFJ....that's difficult!\nhttps://www.careerplanner.com/MB2/TypeInPopulation.cfm
2	I browse this sub a lot, learning about ISFJs.  As an ENTJ, I can say we are strongly different in our approach.  I know Alpha from our ENTJ forum.  Good guy.  I'll give my unsolicited opinion here, we aren't a match in friendship or romance.  The emotional outbursts, the passive nature when intellectual conversations arise, the way an ISFJ is exhausted after a full social day, etc.  \n\nI've had my fair share of interactions with ISFJs, and while they're nice people with huge hearts, we are way too overbearing and domineering for them.  
1	Hi! You're welcome to PM me if you'd like to, although I can't guarantee that I'll be particularly interesting to you. I don't think I've met an ENTJ before, either. 
10	Why are people convinced ISFJs are sociopaths?	Seriously, in the past month I've had two redditors come at me and tell me ISFJs are sadistic and sociopathic. Currently engaged in an argument with a guy who INSISTS everyone in our personality type gets off on death porn. Wtf??? 
12	I can see some unhealthy ISFJs becoming manipulative bitches, but there are some sociopathic traits that most ISFJs don't have:\n\n- A general lack of shame or remorse. This is really not an ISFJ thing. We always seem to care about how others perceive us. We wouldn't do things that would reflect on us negatively (not in public, at least).\n- A huge ego and sense of entitlement. Most ISFJs I know have self-esteem issues and are always doubting themselves.
10	I could see where they would think ISFJ might be a little sociopathic, considering I've been called a Sociopath before (I am an ISFJ) by friends that I've hurt, but I think it stems from my need to please everyone and how good of a liar I am, and I don't think that's an ISFJ thing I think that's a "I've been hurt before and now my walls are hurting others" kind of thing.  
9	that's weird, i've never heard that one before.\n\nwhat i've heard is: ISFJ girls are "literally the best there are". that person straight up thinks they're better than ALL OTHERS.\n\nalso, judging by all the "how do i get with this ISFJ person"? posts, you'd think we're not sadistic sociopaths. and reading them all from the poster's perspective makes it sound like we're just too shy to initiate dating. that doesn't sound like sadistic sociopaths to me. though obviously those posts are super biased.
2	I think they'll say these kinds of things about any type. Go into INFJ forums as an ENTP (I did this), and many will tell you they think ENTPs are predisposed to narcissism or psychopathy because they've had really bad relationships with these types.\n\nWhat's interesting though is that those people I've found the story out about seem to have relatively few relationships and have stuck with the bad relationships for a very long time even when they knew they were bad.
1	Dude, is this sub back to life? I'm so happy. \n\nAnyways, I totally can see it. I watch death porn all the time admittedly.
11	Avoiding Relationships?	I've always kinda chose to never seek out and have a 'romantic' relationship with anyone. There is another thread going on about deep connections with others that hit close to home that made me start thinking if others feel the same way. I don't think there is anyone that I can say I have a 'deep connection' with... I thought I did recently, but it isn't working out. Am I lonely? Sometimes, but not very often... It's usually when I see my friends 'happy' in their relationships. It always fades after I go home, back into my comfort zone. I honestly adore being alone on those days that I don't have 'anything' to do; and I kinda don't want to change it... I don't think I want a family, or kids... Long story short, I'm very happy with my lifestyle right now, however, often times I wonder what it would be like to have someone else around; since I hate doing 'things' without a 'friend' around to do it with... \n\nWith that out of the way, I've come to the conclusion that after observing and watching others around me always seemingly to fail in their own relationships for various reasons, (the one that always sticks out to me is my observation of how much damn work it takes to maintain a relationship) You know how we are; ISFJs, we are always 'there' to help others with their problems and give them advice on how to fix it. My logic I placed onto myself for a long time now to avoid the issue; I've chosen to never seek one out. A friend says I'm afraid of commitment. That's not the case since I'm great with *my* obligations; Work, paying bills, rent, dieting (I lost 75 lbs!), keeping my space clean, taking care of pets, car maintenance, etc... I just don't want anything to do with all the crap you have to deal with in a relationship. Do any other ISFJs feel the same way by chance?
8	[deleted]
7	i am almost 29, i've met 2.5 people i've felt like i could be fully open and free around.\n\neveryone else, even when i feel really close to them and care about them deeply, i talk to them in a very controlled way. i consider how they feel and think very carefully when i spend time with them. it is straining but makes the communication smooth.\n\ni've also tried dating someone that i didn't feel like i could be open and free around, thinking that maybe i'm just too picky and over time things will become easier and i can express myself more freely. but that didn't work.\n\nbut i do think about how amazing it'll be to have that someone in my life one day. someone that spending time with doesn't drain me, someone i can split chores with, someone to share incomes with, someone who can help me get lower taxes in the eyes of the law via marriage with. it'd be great to have someone in my life who also wants to reach similar life goals and wants to partner up so we can help each other do em.
5	I can relate. Although I haven't had too many romantic relationship issues, I have an extremely difficult time getting and maintaining deep friendships for similar reasons. I find it hard to put so much effort into something that I feel like I don't always get as much back in return. Friendships are a difficult balance, and while I have many casual friends, I never really have a lot of "dependable" friends in the way I am dependable towards others, if that makes sense. Its too much effort to open up to people who I don't know if they will be there.
4	In my case, it's weird, because on the one hand I want to meet women and improve my dating life, but on the other hand when someone who I feel attracted to shows interest on me, even if it happens that I also like them, I end up avoiding contact. It makes no sense. \nI relate to this post, too.
2	I've felt some of the same things. For similar reasons I avoided relationships for the longest time. I usually feel a bit lonely or some longing for that when I'd always see my friends appearing happy in their relationships, but I also enjoy being alone and like you said, it always seemed like maintaining relationships takes so much work. I graduated university and still had never dated anyone, and I was fine with that. \n\nOn the other hand, I've also always appreciated being able to connect with people at a deeper level. In the other thread, there was some talk about not being able to do that unless in a romantic relationship. I would disagree and instead say it's harder, even more so for those of your romantic gender interest. I had and have several friends I consider very close that I would tell pretty much anything to, but they're not romantic in the slightest. That being said, there is something about being in a relationship with someone that opens doors for these connections to form, and often opening up to one another and helping one another are shared goals in a relationship. That intentionality really helps connect with someone. \n\nIn terms of your question on avoiding relationships long term, I think it depends on the person and who you meet. Several of my elder family members have felt similarly and have never gotten married. I had no intention of dating after I moved, even after I met my current SO, but after getting to know them over a year or so, I gradually felt more comfortable with the idea. We both have our problems, but after spending time with them over a year, I found that most of their struggles could be helped but wouldn't bog me down or make me feel like a big burden on my time (particularly with how much I enjoy helping people). We both enjoy alone time, and we both are learning to better respect boundaries and time. It's a big learning process for me and I don't know how long this will last, but after a year now I'm so glad to have been in a relationship with them. I'm pretty sure most people I could be in a reasonable relationship with I would not enjoy, for reasons you've stated here, but I met a person I ended up growing to feel otherwise about and that changed (for now). I get where you're coming from, so you're not alone. :)  
2	I'm an ENFP [41]. My ISFJ fiancé [45] may be in denial of sharing a similar conviction. It's to the point that I think I may have pressured him into engagement. We've been engaged for a year and this guy has developed so many excuses for not being able to marry or converge homes it's comical. \n\nWe have been living in separate homes we own and maintained separate bills for 3.5 years. Its getting so old. Things were going great and we had worked through lots of personality differences but recently found out he had established some whimsical state ("Get right") we had to get to that only he could define in order to plan our future. \n\nif I argue about it, it resets the clock. "We argue too much. Have to get right before we make any plans"\n\nbut... um... what's this ring mean? halp!\n\nSo if you got pressured into engagement could you imagine yourself doing the same thing? Could you see yourself agreeing with words but digging your heels in action? It sounds like keeping the "taking care of my own shit" status quo you described. \n\nI really hope I didn't pressure him but it's getting difficult to think he just can't fully be in a relationship. Got any ISFJ insight?\n\nEdit: some words and clarification \n\nEdit 2: fixed fecently my most hilarious typo ever
2	You took this right out of my mouth ! I'm in the same boat as you , I enjoy being by myself and everyone always telling me I need to try to get into a relationship , with commitment I have no issues as well I too lost a whole bunch if weight 95 pounds . I just don't want a relationship and don't want to go through all the issues it brings , I like being by myself and when I feel lonely I have good friends to spend my time with or I just read and game doesn't bother me one bit . Thanks for sharing this I'm glad I'm not alone . 
1	I feel like a lot of things talked about here are less ISFJ and more Enneagram 9 behaviours, though the two are often overlapping!\n\nDoes anyone relate?
20	ISFJ + Personal connection	As an ISFJ, I have noticed that I enjoy connecting with people of all origins. I enjoy learning about their lives, seeing them grow and helping them where possible. I care a lot about people and will always be there for them, regardless of how well I know them. I'm just happy to connect with people; I've also noticed that it can be extremely draining to be with other people -- especially when it is a large group -- which is normal from a I perspective. \n\nThe part that puzzles me is that irregardless of the connection, I feel alone. I don't feel the strong sense of connection with someone unless I am in a romantic relationship with them. Do other ISFJs feel this way?
10	yeah, same. there is a level of detachment. "i want to help you but i don't want to be around you all the time unless we're dating".\n\nalso with people that have different characteristics and beliefs and origins, they're great and they're interesting. there is so much to learn or observe from them. but the bigger the differences the faster the drain and groups make it worse. \n\nmaybe it's because we observe and act to help, which is emotionally draining since it's such an emotional investment.\n\nand romantic relationships are more give and take about it, the person we're with makes us feel good and refreshes our energy. so we can be attached and spend loads of out time with that person.
3	Yeah, this is very relatable. I care about a lot of people, and can feel great concern for them, but I only typically feel a real, genuinely close bond/connection with a couple of people in my life, usually a romantic partner, my twin, and my best friend.\n\nI keep so much of myself separate from the outside world, and from people I'm not super close with. \n\nI'd say there's only a few people who genuinely know me as I am, and who make me feel like I'm not alone. Otherwise, most of my connections with people feel quite guarded and sort of one-sided.
3	irregardless is the informal way of spelling regardless. Idk why it seems like people have been leaning towards saying irregardless lately but every time I hear/read it, it makes me nauseous
3	Nowadays, the strongest senses of connection that I feel occur after reading posts like this. I love this subreddit.
2	for me, i feel like romantic relationships are the ones that easily fade out because i will do anything to keep them as a friend, i dont like romantic relationships that much. also as you said, i also really enjoy meeting new people and listen to their stories. 
2	Tips on getting into a relationship with a male isfj	Female infj here. For a while now I've been spending time with a male isfj in a small group setting, as he is a friend of a friend. There is obvious chemistry between us, and at this point I believe he knows I am interested in him ( I also believe he is interested in me).\n\nThe problem is, he is incredibly shy with me one on one. Like, to the point where he can only say one word at most, and will not make eye contact. Over time, with our small group of friends, he has grown to be flirty with me, but it seems the moment we are alone he is paralyzed.\n\nI can relate, as I am very nervous around him as well, but not in such an extreme manner. However, my problem is we don't text, and things are moving very slowly. I know he deals with anxiety, so I was thinking of asking him out.\n\nMale isfj's, how would you like to be approached when being asked out? How can I avoid scaring him? I am somewhat social awkward myself, so I haven't found a way to naturally suggest texting. Honestly, I was hoping to ask him out tomorrow night after our group goes to the movies.\n\nAny tips, or advice? I really like this guy and I think we could be a great match. Thanks!
6	I can't say how he'll react, and I probably wouldn't react the same as him due to the fact that I am not as anxious as he sounds. However, if it's what you want to do, you should! He may be caught off guard and nervous, but if he wants to go out with you, I can't see him saying no. Besides, I am of the belief it's better to have an answer than wondering what could have been.
3	I tried to answer a similar question on /r/mbti :\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/6dxaon/dear_male_isfjs/\n\nMaybe it helps. :)
2	Not sure if he is anything like me because I don't consider me that nervous around girls. However that also took some "practice" and getting used to. However, the worst thing about dating for me is escalating from being (obviously) interested into each other to making a move. Every single time I was on a date and we were about to say bye and I was thinking if this is the moment I chickened out. That all or nothing situation freaks me out.\n\nWhat worked every time was to somehow start cuddling and then go for it.\n\nAlthough, he seems to be already uncomfortable having a normal conversation. He might be into you and constantly screaming in his head to himself: "Don't mess it up, jackass!".\n\nWhat might work:\n\n* Ask him about something he is interested in.\n* Make it clear that you enjoy being with him.\n* Bring up suggestions for topics or activities so he doesn't need to worry that you don't like it.\n* Choose low stakes stuff where he doesn't worry about failing in some way.\n* If he tries do something for you in any form. Let him do it and thank him.\n\nThat all sounds kinda bad when I write it down :D but he most probably will get more confident if he feels safe and learns that you like him.
10	I want to know what self-care is like for ISFJs	Hi! I'm designing a self-care app for FJ types in the Myers Briggs system.\n \nI'm an INFJ myself, and I really care about doing this project right. If you could share your thoughts on this survey, I would appreciate it immensely: https://goo.gl/forms/witvsfsiwK7rsMJz1\n\nJust fill in what you feel like answering. Everything is anonymous & I don't ask for any personal info. Any little bit helps. Thanks so much!!
5	I know that self-care is something that's really important to a lot of INFJs, but I have to admit, I can't really relate to the questions on the survey. I have a feeling that the way INFJs relate to self-care is a Ni-Fe thing, and personally as an ISFJ, the way it's described in the survey is a little foreign to me.\n\nWhile sometimes I do the things you listed... they are never for their own sake, and never primarily have myself in mind when I'm doing it. Honestly, my own self-care is about other people... someimes I'll write poetry because I have someone in mind, and something I want them to hear; sometimes I'll go for a walk, but only because that is one of the times I work out my faith, sometimes I'll read, but only because I'm searching for the answer that will make someone's life easier; free them from a burden they've been struggling with.\n\nMost of the time, I find the idea of doing things for myself just to make myself feel better almost repulsive, and even though I totally understand that it's important for other types, for me it's absolutely heartbreaking.\n\nWhen I'm feeling run down, what could I possibly do but talk to my colleagues about it and share in that feeling... build our relationship so that we can relate more strongly, and be better for it.\n\nWhen I'm feeling like life has knocked me down, what could I possibly do but help those in my community, and tell them that I know how it feels to be totally bereft of hope, and be there for them just as they're there for me.\n\nWhen I'm broken hearted, what can I do except share what I'm feeling with the lonely, and tell them that despite what has happened... I still have hope, and I know good things can come.\n\nAll my self care is about others, and I just can't bring myself to do anything that helps me, but doesn't help others or brings me in closer to them. I swear the day that I have a problem that can't help someone else... throw me in a ditch because I'm done.\n\nSo yeah... sorry, but the way the questions were asked... I just couldn't relate to it.
3	I responded! This sounds like a neat project, I hope you come back to share it as you make progress or at least once it's done! 
2	I don't think ISFJs really do self-care. They pretend that they do not need it and focus on caring for others.

4	Isfj in a new relationship battling anxiety	Hello. I am an isfj male 23yo. I was in a serious relationship (for 2 years) and broke up a year ago. Now I am in a new relationship but I don't feel very connected with her like I was in the previous one. I do really like this girl and want to see things through but somehow I feel that there is a barrier that prevents us to connect on a more deeper level. We've only been dating for about a month if that helps and she is 19 years old. \n\nSome background story on my previous relationship: the girl was an ESTP I believe. Bottom line was that towards the end of the relationship, she wasn't too eager to hang out with me anymore and preferred spending time with others besides me. I later found out that she had been cheating. \n\nSo I guess my concerns are:\n\n1.) I find it hard to fully trust my SO now even though I know that she's not the same person. I always have anxiety that the same thing might happen again every time I'm away from her. \n\n2.) when we hang out, and we're just relaxing and cuddling, sometimes it's just quiet and we don't talk about anything so I feel pressured to come up with an interesting conversation. I'm not sure if that's just the way she is (we've only been dating for a month) but sometimes it makes me think that she probably finds me boring which leads me back to my #1 concern. I had her take a personality test once and she tested as an ENFJ. \n\n3.) I am well aware that couples need space but I feel that I'm happiest when I'm around her even though sometimes we don't do much. I don't want to appear needy to her but that's what ends up happening whenever I get into a relationship. I want to spend every moment I can with them. \n\nI'm pretty sure I can keep going with the list but I'll keep it short. Basically it all ties into my #1 concern which is anxiety over her leaving because I'm not good enough for her. I felt this way because of how the previous one ended and I feel like it deeply damaged my self esteem. \n\nAre there any advice you guys can give me as far as overcoming/coping with these feelings. I know that if I don't do something about it now, it will end up dooming the relationship. I want to be better and I want to completely get rid of these walls that I have so that I can allow myself to fully invest my all into this new relationship. 
2	You kinda hit the nail on the head when you admitted that your last breakup impacted your self esteem, as that is the root cause of all the concerns you are mentioning. \n\nThe most important thing that you must realize right now is that you are NOT at fault for being cheated on. That is 100% a failure on your ex's part and you must understand that any reasonable person would go and talk to their SO about what they feel rather than try to find someone else. What your ex did was immature and speaks to a deep character failure that is not in any way related to you at its core. Unfortunately however, what happened to you was a consequence of that flaw.\n\nUnfortunately, as many ISFJ's (myself included) are, we often tend to internalize the causes for things going wrong in our lives, to some extent as least. This feeling of not being good enough sounds like a manifestation of that. I would recommend talking to someone, preferably a therapist, in order to help understand why you are feeling the way you do, and to help you understand that those feelings that you are experiencing are misguided. \n\nTo tackle those three issues directly, the only thing I can suggest is being direct and honest. Just ask her if she is comfortable with silences sometimes, maybe in a more tactful way, or not its up to you. But I would also recommend, most importantly, opening up to her a little bit. Talk to her that you sometimes find it difficult to trust people because of what happened before. I would advise against dumping all of your fears out, but being open with her can go a long way to helping to resolve them. Because you may have a hundred different little things running in your mind, but they all stem from the same source. I'm confident that by being open with her and getting help, this self-doubting you struggle with will resolve itself :)
1	Why do ISFJ's always think they are boring? You guys aren't boring. 
1	I've felt anxiety surrounding relationships before as well. Whether it would end, whether I wanted to stay with her, whether I could marry the person in a few years. Stupid stuff.\n\nI tend to dwell a lot on stuff, and it clouds my judgement. I typically worry that **without** this person, I'm missing out on some great live experiences, or possibly "the one" (not religious, but still think about if this is someone I could marry and be with forever). \n\nI've found: relationships should be easy. You need to enjoy the present moment of the relationship - ask yourself, "Am I happy today in this relationship?" "Are we on the same page as a couple?". Continue to be honest with her about your feelings, treat her special, and realize she is using her limited time to hang out with you. I'll also say...\n\nYou don't need this girl. You KNOW you could live without her. There's a fuck ton of other girls to be with that would like you somewhere out there. Spend time doing shit you love. Become smarter, more informed, more athletic - doesn't matter. If you focus on improving yourself and doing things you like, girls will recognize that.\n\nThis girl obviously sees something in you. Have interesting conversations: tell her "I like how you X, or my favorite thing about you is Y", tell her about a hobby of yours. Tell her about the random shit you're thinking about. If she doesn't care or doesn't listen, screw it, she's not for you.\n\nIn summary: Be who you want to be, do what you want to do, say what you want to say. I know it's easy to get in your SO's head or your own head, but you'll drive yourself crazy if you let it continue. Life is fun man, don't stress :) Also, try meditation (Headspace app) and read Waking Up if you're not convinced it could help you!\n\nBest. 
2	[Academic] Perceptions of Self and Intimacy (20-35yo)	Hey there, hope you don't mind me attempting to pick your brains for a minute - I got good participation levels from other MBTI groups so I thought I'd extend it to all groups and try to get a more representative sample. FYI - the study is not collecting personality type information.\n\nMy dissertation for my masters in psychology is looking into one possible explanation for avoidance behaviours in forming intimate relationships. If you are 20-35yo and keen to contribute to my study then you can do so by following the link below. Any questions give me a shout, also I'm happy to discuss and hear your thoughts on the subject off the record if you want! It should't take too long but you're free to stop at any point anyway. It may cause some emotional distress as it involves some self evaluation so if you experience any discomfort and would like some guidance please get in touch.\n\nI will leave the survey open until the end of this week.\n\nCheers!\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/F3BXHWN
1	Confused as to the difference between "ideal" and "ought" self. 
4	MBTI Discord server	We have been working on this server for almost a year now, and at the moment we are staying at the 100+ members. We want to branch out, and that's why we're posting this. You're all welcome, even if you don't know your type. https://discord.gg/csDt8Jg
2	A little help, perhaps?	INFP fella here, recently I met with a ISFJ girl at a 'work place'. She seemed nice although quiet and unwilling, lazy, hard to talk to. After a few days we went to the city together and I finally get her to talk. \nI spoke to her god-mother(not sure if that's a thing but, best I could translate) who is in a very good relationship with her mother, so she knows a lot about her, she told she seems kinda sad, and is unwilling to do stuff - like go out and she doesn't truly have friends to hang out with.\nShe's been single for all I know (but didn't seem to me she had any attraction towards me). \n(Also not really go out with her either, but still...) \nMy question is - should I talk to her about this? Should I go after her, ask her what's really troubling her, or are ISFJ girl like this sometimes and there's nothing I could do about it? Its really troubling me, to see her, so.. So lifeless,... But on the other I have no idea how she'd react,if I'd just go after with such 'accusations'........
9	In short: don't.\n\nISFJs are the kind of people who don't like to talk about their problems with people they barely know. I'm not a girl, but it would make me really uncomfortable if someone from work tried to force me out of my shell.
17	Do ISFJ people suffer much more from Anxiety/Depression?	I Just wanted to know how many of you that *WILL COMMENT* have suffered much from anxiety/depression or knows someone with ISFJ personality who has. I have an ISFJ personality and Im just a bit curious.
7	[deleted]
7	Been depressed multiple times in my life. After any major event that affects me negatively or whenever people I've been close to leave from my life.\n\nWe invest a lot in our relationships (romantic, or non-romantic) and it's always hard for us to part. Same goes with a lot of changes (moving, new city, change of friends) - that brings anxiety and too much anxiety makes us shut off from the world.
2	I've been suffering from major depression & anxiety since I was about 8 years old (I'll be 21 in October)...
2	Yes.
2	I do
2	ISFJ with clinical depression. Been on meds for about a year now which changed everything.
2	I have some issues with anxiety, but I don't think I've ever had any problems with depression, personally. I've always been a pretty happy person, even when I'm anxious.
2	As a fellow ISFJ who too suffers from drowning in the worst thoughts my mind can hit me with more than occasionally, I upvoted all of you. \n\nIt's a small, and frankly meaningless gesture.., but I hope you all have a great day today!!!
2	ISFJ, been suffering since birth
2	I used to be completely unflappable until I got to college, then college gave me anxiety and now it's generalized to a lot of other aspects of my life :/ Depression is a lot harder to say... I have frequent, temporary depressive "slumps" that last a few days to maybe two weeks max, but I might also just have dysthymia or something in general. I don't really think so but I feel like mental health professionals keep trying to push me in that direction so maybe there's something to it, who knows. 
1	I personally have not, but I know far too many others (none ISFJs) who do. It honestly hurts to see people I care about going through such deep suffering and not be able to fix it. The most I can do is be there for them, and while it sometimes feels like it's not helping, I'm not going anywhere because nobody deserves to feel alone. 
1	depression anxiety is yes.
1	yup, mostly anxiety 
1	ISFJ Female\n\nSocial anxiety for me since I was pretty young. It's better but I'm still working on it. I've notice I go through cycles with it personally. \n\nDepression...I have a lot of symptoms of it I noticed for me but not full on. Sometimes though it may hit worse then expected but overall it's the anxiety that's worse and the depression can be sometimes the add on or social anxiety is the main course and the depression is just a small side dish I guess.
1	I got social anxiety and depression once I moved away from home and started college. I would say it's been about 3 years now
1	Yep. Depression in high-school/college (and post-partum) but mostly anxiety now. Remember having anxious thoughts as young as 5, though.
1	 I don't often have anxiety but when I do, meditation does wonders to relieve the stress. It helps sort out the sources of stress to help me tackle the problem at hand.
1	Yes to both since I was 13 
1	generalized anxiety disorder basically since childhood but diagnosed in 2015. currently seeking treatment.
1	I'm an ISFJ with extreme anxiety & depression. I think like others here, my anxiety is the underlying cause of the depression.\n\nMeds help with the depression but I'm still struggling to cope with the anxiety daily. Have meds for panic attacks but need to work more on cognitive therapy techniques.
1	While I'm not ISFJ we do share a lot of the same plights in life with regards to our cognitive functions.  Leading with an introverted perceiver, Fe Aux, Ti tertiary.   I often view ISFJ's as the more stable version of INFJ's.  \n\nI also have an ISFJ buddy who deals with his fair share of anxiety and depression.  We kind of share Ni's future with Si's past in conversations to sort of supercharge dealing with life's problems.  \n\nIf I had any advice from what I have seen in my ISFJ buddy and how he is working to be happier.  Stability can suck, once you learn how to exist in your little world of anxiety and still succeed in life, it seems like Si keeps ISFJ's closed off and stuck in this world of anxiety because of it's familiarity.\n\nSo shake things up a little, take on little challenges to open up and be part of the world.  Have that conflict you have been avoiding, tell someone how you actually feel, talk about all of those awkward things that run through your head 24 hours a day, step out of Si's comfort zone.  \n\nAnd you fucker's are better at progressing once you start going too, the whole "Remembering things" that I hear about so frequently gives you a bit of a leg up when you decide you want to do something.  But it also gives you a .... leg down?  Getting started since Si dislikes unfamiliar/unknown situations.  \n\nTLDR: Work on being vulnerable instead of being so private.  The world will open up to you.   
1	Oh yeah
4	What's your job?	I am in the middle of a quarter life crisis and currently am exploring career options.\n\nI was in social work but long story short, that didn't end too well for me.\n\nWhat's your job/career? How is that going for you?\n\nI would love to hear from my fellow ISFJers!
3	Senior software developer. For the most part it goes well. Change is an everyday thing so you've got to be able to filter out the BS for the real work. I like writing code and I like writing code that helps other developers do their faster or easier. 
2	I am graduated in Veterinary medicine, but last year I decided to change my path a little and started a biomedical research master program. I have always been passionate about health sciences, but I didn't see myself dealing with irresponsible clients/owners of pets. Also, last years have been rough in my family due to health issues, and that also made me decide to work in a field more related with human medicine. Vets are important in the preclinical stages when working with mice/rats. Currently I am doing my internship in an oncology lab, and if it's possible I would be staying here for a PhD next year :) 
2	I have been a library assistant for a few years. I would spend down time learning to code and eventually went back to school and got my masters degree in Instructional Design & Technology. I began to do websites as a hobby and now transitioning into being a web developer full-time. Working public services and helping people has been great but I really enjoy the creativity and fulfillment of seeing the end result of a completed website. As an introvert, I also enjoy being able to work on things without being interrupted constantly.  
2	production manager/engineer/it/purchasing/office manager/ assembly worker/accountant/quality assurance for my dad's wire and cable assembly company. we have 20 something employees but all of them are on the assembly line. all office jobs are divided up between me and my parents. right now things are slow but when they're hectic the hours are intense (58-70 hours a week)\n\ni don't love the job. i think i'd be happier doing some sort of mentoring job with kids or teens. but this makes money for the time being. \n\ni do volunteer work on the weekends to help ease that need. also i plan on quitting this job once enough positions are replaced with employees instead of me and my parent's running the entire clerical side of things.
2	Cna/Med tech working on my RN 
2	IT Specialist but my major was Video Production and in September I am moving to Spain to work with an international production company
2	Oh yes ! I love my job can't wait to finish nursing school. 
2	Rn, after 12 years of being a stay at home mom
2	Part-time teacher and assistant librarian :) Going great!
4	ISFJ girls	I've noticed that ISFJ girls are literally the best there are.  What is the best way to talk to and relate with them?  
12	I like the smart/witty/dark humored guys. But honestly find out whatever she likes and show interest in it. It's the little things that matter the most. Just because we have the same personality doesn't mean we all are the same when it comes to how someone approaches us.
8	1/5th of female population is ISFJ.\n\nAnd every single one of us is different.
7	stay away from em! THEY'RE MINE! ALL MINE!
4	Care to elaborate on why you think they are literally the best there are?
3	I like to connect talking about personal stuff and getting to know the other person instead of empty small talk. I enjoy talking about experiences, travelling, family, and knowing the other person point of view about a variety of issues. \n
1	This submission has been randomly featured in /r/serendipity, a bot-driven subreddit discovery engine. More here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Serendipity/comments/6em9v0/isfj_girls_xpost_from_risfj/
1	I haven't found many 
1	as an ISFJ girl I would say that it's important to show interest in her interests, my boyfriend doesn't care about anything I like and it's very distressing sometimes. I also swoon like a Victorian era Lady over someone who can really lay on the charm. 
1	ask genuine questions to get to know them on a deeper level than the surface. its great to talk about school, work, etc. but that's not what attracts isfj's. and pay attention. like really look at them and be present. but like some people already said, everyone is different. this can go for anyone really. 
2	I see this sub is a bit dead but I'll give it a shot. INFJ vs ISFJ	INFJ here! For the longest time I was mistyped as an ISFJ so because of this I am constantly questioning myself between the two. When I read the INFJ description it made a lot more sense than ISFJ did. I'm not a traditionalist in any sense of the word (I questioned this a lot when I thought I was ISFJ), I question why a lot, I'm a perfectionist, I make up random scenarios in my head that will probably never happen, looking at a situation I can guess the outcome quite accurately, I'm a huge future thinker....\n\nBut there's always that sliver of doubt...\n\nI would go to the INFJ sub about this but they seem to think everyone is mistyped (it's a really annoying thing over there). \n\nWhat differences have you noticed between the two? \n
8	If you're in doubt, keep reading about function stacks and see what does apply to you. It might take a while until you can objectively assess what's your dominant function, but you don't need to decide on a type today, do you? Relax and take your time.\n\nDescriptions are very misleading, and people tend to be biased towards the cooler ones. At first I didn't recognize myself in the ISFJ description - it all sounded too "normal" and vanilla. And there's a lot of overlap in the description, due to both having Fe-Ti. Don't get worked up on things like "but I'm a huge future thinker, right?" - these don't necesarily prove a type. For example, I also make up these random scenarios in my head that will probably never happen. And any ISFJ could look at a situation and guess the outcome, if they draw from their rich experience. And "tradition" is often a meaningless word without proper context.\n\nNormally I would say you're not an ISFJ, but a paragraph alone isn't enough for an objective assessment. Nobody knows the real you, the best thing is to have a look yourself at the Si-Ni differences (and not just the simplified stereotypes - "oh yeah, Si have good memories, Ni are incredibly future oriented").\n\nYou could also read some accounts written by Si dominants, like this one: https://intj-confessions.tumblr.com/post/130602418373/intj-vs-istj . This helped me see why I was not an INFJ after all. \n\nPlease don't take it personally - I'm not trying to convince you that you are ISFJ. However, if you are in doubt, there is a chance to be mistyped and only you can find out and decide what type you are. 
2	I don't think you're an ISFJ. INFJs are mistyped a lot, but that alone shouldn't cause you to question it as the must be some people that are actually INFJ.\n\nThe things you say sound stereotypically INFJ. Introverted intuition is the big one, and that's future orientated, it usually requires a focus, and works mainly on inventive things. Often that means that you will get all sorts of very good ideas for new problems, but hit something of a wall when required to creatively problem solve situations you've faced before.\n\nThe following text is something that I included in a PM explaining some things I'd observed about Si-Dom. This alone may convince you that you're not one, but if you have any further questions, I'm sure we can help.\n\nProcess monitoring; as a type three enneagram I'm very task orientated, and with almost anything I'm very focused in the current step of things, and this even goes with quite diffuse things like dating. E.g., weighing the interactions, seeing how to progress to the next level of intimacy etc.\n\nSensitivity to feedback; I find handling feedback incredibly stressful. Even just having messages on Reddit can be something of an ordeal for me as I expect negative feedback... sometimes deservedly so.\n\nSensory memory; I can recall sensations like the feel of sand between my toes on the beach easily, and extremely old conversations, or the memory of writing particular things on a piece of paper. I've remembered layouts of documents that were five plus years old that I haven't thought about once in the interim as I could recall the sensations of writing it.\n\nSensory immersion; I can enter a sensory flow state when immersed in nature. I can watch ripples in a river, just standing there, and I will completely detach and suddenly be aware that substantial time has past. Also there is the speed of sensory details, I have to walk extremely slowly to take in details of leaves and things like that, but when I do I become very peaceful, and start restoring energy.\n\nSpecialist skills; there are certain areas that I can speak about like an expert, and when I immerse myself in the topic I gain an aptitude that isn't generally available to me. Like if I'm writing, I can read Shakespeare for a while and adopt his writing style and produce something far beyond my usual abilities.\n\nMemorising tricks; I can and do use the tricks stated in Neuroscience of Personality to memorise lists of things, using the progressive rote technique it talks about.
1	Can't help, but wanted to mention that I'm in the same boat. 
4	I know about the 5 love languages, but they seem a bit too general. Is one big way an ISFJ shows they care is that they remember very specific details about you or about conversations with you- details others would forget?	Si dominance is all about memory after all. I think this is one way the male ISFJ in my life shows me (female INFP) he cares.\n
5	Not quite. I remember odd things about *everyone* not just people I love.
3	We could tell you all the different ways that ISFJs usually show that they care, but I wonder whether that's really the issue here. If you feel like he's not showing that he cares in a way that you can really connect to... that's the problem, not that you're not interpreting what he's doing or saying in the right way.\n\nWhile identifying love languages is important... unless your partner is actually demonstrating their love for you, using your love language, there is very little comfort for the knowledge.\n\nISFJs have auxiliary Fe, and this means that we have extraordinary capacity to speak of our feelings, if you feel like you're not communicating in that way, maybe you can talk to him about it. Just be sensitive in the conversation as it's likely to hit him hard if he's unaware, but he will likely address the situation very quickly.
3	Sometimes? I'm an ISFJ with a horrible memory (routinely forget birthdays, major life events, favorite colors/foods/shows/etc). It doesn't mean I don't love my close friends and family, and I often feel very guilty about it, but things just don't stick in my brain. For me, my ISFJ-ness shows because I always do my best to be considerate of others, and that effort scales depending on how much I care about you. Si isn't about memory in the sense that it means your memory is inherently good or that you'll definitely remember everything, although that's a pretty common misconception. 
2	Love languages focus how one can give and receive "love" as symbolized through those actions. \n\nRemembering details about someone you love, because you love them, does represent that you love them. But do you convey those details in order to communicate your love? Or does someone telling you things they remembered about you communicate love to you? Perhaps incidentally but not directly. \n\nAs such your detail of people's lives has more to do with Si then love. And the more you love someone the more cognitive attention you will spend on them. Which can then be used to express your love via gifts or services that are meaningful to that individual. 
3	ISFJs: What Is Your Subtype? Si or Fe?	
5	I mostly feel like the Si subtype. I'm too shy to relate to the openness and lack of restraint of the Fe subtype. Which is not really a surprise, since I felt stuck in a Si-Ti loop for a long time.\n\nOn the other hand, I don't really relate to the "stylish clothes and accesories" bit. I mean yeah, I can appreciate it and enjoy wearing something nice once in a while, but I mostly stick to jeans-and-tshirts routine.\n\n
3	I am like 75% Fe. 
2	Wow, I relate to so much in both descriptions. If I had to choose, I'd say that the sensory subtype rings more true, but only slightly.
2	Feel like there are many aspects of both that describe me well, but also several of each that really don't so I'm in the middle I suppose. 
2	Wow, being pretty new to this MBTI thing, it just keeps blowing my mind.\n\nSubtype mostly Si, it seems. Description was eerily accurate in some parts. How wonderful.\n\nThat said, "dresses tastefully" missed the mark lol
1	Definitely Si.
3	Where do you see yourself?	I just found this subreddit. It never occurred to me to look it up, but I've been binging through the threads. My people!!!\n\nMy question for you. What Hogwarts House do you see yourself in? Have you been placed elsewhere (Pottermore, Buzzfeed, etc.)\n\nMy apologies if this post is out-of-theme, but I've always been curious.
4	I took the Pottermore quiz and got put in Slytherin. All of my friends who love Harry Potter see me in Slytherin as well... Not very conventional ISFJ. I have no idea how that happened? But I love the ambition of Slytherins so I kind of like the idea.
3	Hands down Ravenclaw for me. Always loved problem solving and analyzing and spreadsheets. I always felt I'd be good friends with people in Hufflepuff, but Ravenclaw is where I'd be. :)
3	Hufflepuff all the way! Maybe 10% Ravenclaw because I'm a professional data nerd, but I'm a badger for life.
2	My own answer:\n\nI've always seen myself as a Ravenclaw. I assume that's picking up on the Introverted, Sensing, Judging parts.\n\nHowever, Pottermore kept placing me in Gryffindor, which I guess pulls from the Feeling. But the archetype of ISFJ, as a nurturer/protector also seems more Gryffindor. \n\nAny correlations?
2	I've always been placed in Ravenclaw, and while I feel like I can relate to it, I think I belong more in Hufflepuff. I value kindness a lot, and I'm not necessarily very smart, academically speaking.
2	Ravenclaw, no question. 
2	I see myself as a Hufflepuff, but I'm usually put in Ravenclaw when I take those quizzes. Occasionally I'll be put in Gryffindor, but that's just straight up wrong, haha. 
2	I identify more with Ravenclaw. I'm usually sorted there but sometimes it's Hufflepuff.
2	i'm like 75-80% hufflepuff and ravenclaw. 50% slythern. and 10% gryfindor.
2	I tested Gryffindor. I guess I don't fit the stereotypical isfj?
2	I always test Hufflepuff, and I agree with that assessment. I do well academically but it's not something I'm really invested in? I love learning, but generally I value kindness over intelligence. 
2	RAVENCLAW!!!!\n\nI'm almost a Hufflepuff, though. Very nearly.\n\nTo those wondering why there's so many Ravenclaws btw, I think it's because we are more likely to be interested in things  like MBTI because they help us understand the world by analysis (if that makes sense?)\n\n
-2	Out of all the questions in the world...lol
3	N and S	Hello there, INFP here. I'm curious about something. I'm trying to get in touch with my Si and I notice that when a focus on the world around me, it gets hard to pay attention to my constant stream o absurd ideas and I cannot keep perceving the world for long before I get annoyed and defaut back to paying attention to my mind. So I wondered: is that reversed to high Si users? When you try to focus on your ideas connecting inside your head, do you feel annoyed and defaut back to perceving the world around you? 
3	It's kind of the opposite for me. Sometimes I can get caught up on ideas and stuff, but then I realize that none of that will ever happen if I don't focus on the real world, so I go back to the present. I kinda ride the line between sensing and intuition, so I go back and forth between idealistic and realistic. I guess I'm not really a good ISFJ to respond to this then lol. 
2	Im not sure if you are still actively looking at this thread, but Ive always wanted to ask an INFP this: Why do you guys disappear when you get offended? Its happened twice to me and both times I wasn't aware that I offended anyone
2	Researching Si-Ti Loop	I feel as though I have been in a loop for a few months now. Can't get through it and can't get over my crappy situation that happened. I thought researching the loop would help and it has helped me understand even though I haven't found a clear solution except to develop FE better. I feel like I've done a pretty good job of that and it still feels hopeless. I did find this though and thought it was a pretty funny example of how our brain works when in this kind of loop [](https://mbtidatabase.tumblr.com/post/120677825946/how-the-si-ti-loop-works)
1	How does this loop manifest in your case?
15	I wish I didn't feel so deeply.	Don't get me wrong, having empathy is a good thing, but there are points when it's just *too* much for me - for example, when it comes to songs - yes, I love songs, but the emotional connections I have with them- something about it seems like too much. 
5	Me too, but not with songs. Although I do cry whenever I hear "Tequila" or "Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree" because they remind me of my grandpa.\n\nFor me it's more about having trouble making connections with people because I'm resistant to the insane amount of empathy I know I will feel for anything they confide in me. Makes it feel like human connection is more of a burden than it really should be...
3	but it makes inspirational playlists all the more effective. so that's nice.
2	*doesn't empathize because emotionless INTJ jerk*
1	Isn't empathy subjective to a certain degree? You can't "switch off" feelings, but you can choose to put more or less weight on a given thing. That's how you ignore work, studies, social obligations, etc...
9	ISFJs, what are some of your favorite things to do?	
12	When indoors I like to play single player video games or reading manga/comics.\n\nOutdoors, walking in new open spaces.
5	- Reading - as I grew older I started getting more into non-fiction (especially medieval history lately).\n\n- Playing videogames - mostly story driven single player games, but I also enjoy fun coop games. I'm not so much into competitive online games (I guess this is a very ISFJ thing).\n\n- Watching movies - I used to watch a lot of arthouse films, now I stick mostly to tv series and easier stuff. But I plan to return to watching "serious" stuff once I'm in a better state of mind. The backlog is growing daily.\n\n- Traveling and seeing places and art I've read about. Obviously this doesn't happen often, but I made a promise to go out of my country at least once per year. It helps that I'm in Europe, so there's a lot of places to cover.
5	Read, play video games, play board games, watch movies at home with my SO, snuggle with my cats, take walks when the weather is nice. 
6	Cooking (and eating!), playing board and video games, casually hanging out with a small group of close friends, going on walks, the list goes on! Cooking is really enjoyable and pretty relaxing for me because it's a creative process that's also pretty procedural and scientific. The food at the end (usually) tastes yummy too and is a reward in and of itself. It's even better to do with a friend or SO. Smaller group interactions are fun because I enjoy getting to talk to my friends, but the smaller group makes things less chaotic. Walking around outside on a nice day can help take my mind off things. :)
4	I'm big on hands on activities like cooking and knitting. I also really like lifting weights, hiking, walking my dog and reading. Most of my hobbies are things I prefer to do alone and one of the things I enjoy most about them is learning new facts and skills.
4	I like to cook, read, bake, hike, travel, crochet, rock climb, do yoga and play video games with my SO.  
3	I love my me time, as does every introvert. But I really enjoy being with my best friend (or a potential SO) and family, not all the time of course. \n\nVideo games, reading, daydreaming, watching movies/TV shows/anime, sleeping (very fun indeed!), and I really enjoy exercising & feeling great after my workout (sadly I haven't been feeling great afterwards lately).
2	Thanks for all your replies!
2	Crafting, playing video games, going outside on good weather days, going out with friends, spending quality time alone and with my SO. It's all about balance for me to really be happy.
2	Read, coloring, listening to music with my headphones, rollerskating, playing flute, watching tv, watching animals do what they do.
1	Hiking - alone if you are the kind of person who likes to talk a lot\nCooking/baking\nReading\nCleaning\nMovies
1	Travelling is my top 1, but obviously I need some money to do it... I love learning about different cultures and the diverse life styles around the world. \nIn my everyday life I love watching good movies/series and going to the cinema. I like all kind of food so I enjoy eating and going to restaurants with my SO. Meeting with friends and playing boardgames while smoking some weed is a good plan too. Going to the beach when it's sunny and warm and becoming a lizard in the towel. Playing with my PS4. Being lazy around the house with my cat and pet him. Singing and playing the ukelele even if I'm not good at it. Sleeping the weekend's mornings. Great pleasures. 
1	Sleep, video games, play piano, eat, watch birds/other animals
1	Playing guitar, playing chess and listening to latin jazz music.
1	Gaming, sailing, golfing, painting, tennis, reading, volunteering, and watching lots of movies.
2	Any other ISFJs have had similar issues and have any input to deal with this? (X-post from /r/advice)	
15	I'm sorry for bothering you	I don't know why, but whenever I'm talking to someone, I can't help but think how incredibly boring I must be, making me want to do nothing but apologize, and consider if they wouldn't be better of just not talking with me. I'm aware this may sound a bit cliche, but I feel like wherever I go, I'm not wanted nor needed. I know I should try to help myself about that matter, but I reckon there may be people here who felt the same as me, and could maybe help me a bit. (Sry for my bad English, and thanks for your attention!) (Sorry for bothering you all about it)
3	Don't appologize when you can be grateful instead.\n\nLook :\n\n>how incredibly boring I must be\n\nI'm a phony. I speak and try to engage people. I'm specific so I often struggle with the global coherence of what I try to convey.\n\nIt means people get bored of what I say, seeing it as logorrhea. It means I'm often not believe despite being right, like Cassandra in greek mythology.\n\nI wished I could just be let in peace, so I don't have to deal with all this hatred I received through my life. Being collected like you already are is a blessing from my point of view. It also mean you won't necessarily have any benefit to become any louder.\n\n>I'm aware this may sound a bit cliche\n\nAware of something that isn't for sure ? Why should you care about that ?\n\n>but I feel like wherever I go, I'm not wanted nor needed.\n\nThis feeling is called shame. I know it well. I'll show you that a bit later : it's painful to me to just tap in it willfully.\n\n>I know I should try to help myself about that matter, but I reckon there may be people here who felt the same as me, and could maybe help me a bit.\n\nYour wonky sentence structure is really meaningful to me : I have the exact same one !\n\nFrom a grammarian standpoint, you put an articulation that should have been a full stop : you don't reckon anything.\n\nFrom a more humane standpoint, it means you're uneasy and hesitating. I'll show you you don't have to.\n\n>(Sry for my bad English, and thanks for your attention!) (Sorry for bothering you all about it)\n\nFrom the first sentence of my comment, try saying "thank you" instead of "sorry". It's tedious at first, but words shape our thinking habits. It's a old hacking technique I come up on my own. I don't ask for forgiveness anymore. I became bolder, and less ashamed of myself.\n\nNow, the whole subject here. Shame.\n\nI feel unworthy. The constant mistake in others's life.\n\nBut you know what ? You just reminded me [life can't be this way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW5n3k2VgZE). You reminded me I do can help you, and you can help me. You just already did by writing this comment.\n\nSo thank you.\n\n
3	I used to feel that way all the time.\n\nIt helped for a bit getting reassurance from people. I asked around and people said they were happy to know me and find me interesting. They gave me details on what I said or think about that they thought was cool.\n\nNow I remind myself of that when I think I'm not. And I seek the things I'm interested in and share them with people i know want to know about it.
2	Yeah sometimes I have this feeling too, more if I'm with people that I don't know much. It's shitty, because thinking about it while you are having a conversation just makes your anxiety (and consequently your behaviour) worst. A quick suggestion is that if you are in a conversation, try to have all the attention in what the other person is saying instead of being absorbed in your mind. Being focused on what the other person is talking about will make it easier for you to follow with the conversation, asking questions and so on. So try to project your attention OUT of your mind. \n\nIt also seems you have a self esteem issue, and what you say doesn't have the same value compared to what others say, you think you don't worth it. You need to work on that, I had the same problem (and sometimes I still struggle with it). I'm sure you have your strengths, you seem a very considerate person and for sure is not your only strength. So identify them and be really proud of them! On the other hand, you would have weaknesses too, as everyone have.  So you need to acknowledge them and have a proactive attitude to get better at them, but don't beat yourself if you stumble on the path. Be forgiving with you because you are doing your best, little by little. \n\nFor me, a combination of events and efforts had made my self esteem better: I looked for a psychologist and she helped me a lot to change my thinking habits (that were mostly negative and self defeating). Also I started to do yoga, and having time for me and my hobbies. Another thing has been to confront my fears and from here, to recognize the things that I have to improve, as well as those things I did well and I'm proud of. And finally, achieving (some of) the goals that I set for myself. \n\nI wish you the best and I'm sure you will find the way to be more comfortable in your skin, accept yourself the way you are and try to improve from here. You are not alone! 
1	I say this to people all the time.  The con of an ISFJ
6	What do I do to make an ISFJ happier and what is your prefered way of communication?	Hi! \n\n*tl;dr*:\nI'm wondering a few things, and I'd be very thankful if you'd like to take the time to answer!\n\n* what is your prefered way of communicating your needs?\n* what makes you feel appreciated and loved, and how do you show other people love?\n\n\n*more detailed version:*\nThe reason I'm asking is that I (enfp) am in a relationship with an isfj and while we suit each other well, there are a couple of hiccups that we have a hard time finding a solution to. So I thought I'd ask you and then check back in with him and see if any of it resonates with him. \n\n*So far our biggest issues are:*\n\n* Clashing love languages. He likes practical things, like doing stuff around the house, etc. I have ADHD, so cleaning and keeping things organized is hard for me because I constantly misplace stuff and forget about taking out the trash etc. I really do try, but I know he finds it very frustrating. My love language is more physical and verbally expressive, which he doesn't seem to feel comfortable with, and that makes me feel kind of unappreciated, because I am really trying my hardest at talking to him in his love language and not getting much back. I do know he loves me very much, but I need him to show it too.\n\n* Different ways of communicating. I like talking pretty frequently, both about the good and the bad stuff. Just checking in and see the lay of the land so to speak. He however is oblivious of any need to talk until he realizes something has been eating at him for several weeks, so he doesn't raise his concerns until much later, even if I ask him if there's something he would like to change.\n\n* Clashing energy levels. I am an extrovert and I spend my days mostly alone because of my line of work. He is an introvert and works with people, so at the end of the day when we can hang out I have a lot of energy and he is completely pooped.\n\nThanks for reading, and any input you might have! I really appreciate it! :)
2	I'm dating an ISFJ who is pretty different from yours. You may benefit from posting this in r/relationships as well, on help communicating your love languages and expressing love :) \n\nAs for your introvert/extrovert issue, Id say plan a day on the weekend that you two can do extrovert things together that you like. Maybe one day during the week for something that fills your bucket that won't tax him too much (like dinner with a few friends or a board game night). And be content doing your own thing a day or two out of the week as well. You are both your own person, and having time to yourselves is important too. You're allowed to get a drink with the girls while he reads a book at home. 
2	ISFJ here.\nHow about your extravert does things with like minded souls after work?\nCommunication: I prefer to not talk when I am upset, rather mull things over. \n
1	I (female) am probably 65%/35% INFP/ENFP and dated an ISFJ (male). We had every one of the issues you mention, down to the fine details! Unfortunately we broke up, so I definitely can't illustrate success with any behaviors. But- I think the key is the same as with all relationships- good communication. I'd also say to focus on treasuring and loving your differences- how you complement what each other lacks. The specific things I wish I had done more with my ISFJ is notice his subtle non-verbal signals when he was upset and, as you mention, get him more involved in helping me with various projects. He definitely needed to be needed, so to speak. Good luck!!
1	I'm in a fairly new relationship and honestly, it's hard to communicate my needs. I'd prefer to just submit them anonymously (as if you could ever actually do that IRL, this isn't Tumblr), or to be more realistic, just text them late at night when being loopy is acceptable. What my point is here, for the most part, I don't like being direct with my feelings at all. (And I know, it's something I need to fix, communication is important)\n\nWhat makes me feel appreciated and loved, that is, my love language, is physical touch. I'm constantly craving hugs and cuddles from my SO. But it seems that's not *his* love language- so I guess, just try to communicate with him? \n\nAnd I tend to show other people love by touching them somehow (a hand on the shoulder, brushing against them) and complimenting them a lot? \n\nI don't know. I tried my best to answer your questions. \n
4	How does your Si manifest?	I'm wondering if it manifest in other ways then in artistic form, but I'll take your artistic manifestations too!
3	A lot of my current favorite video games are from series I played when I was a kid (Nintendo and JRPG) and it takes me a lot to try a new genre. I'm very conservative with spending and I keep track of how much money I spend and always try to find ways to spend less and save more. I'm big on having a eating/drinking routine, in particular I almost always make the same smoothie every morning for breakfast. I usually don't like abstract / what if talks. If it's something that can't be applied that could potentially be related to or done on a physical level I just dont even bother taking part of discussions. A lot of decisions I make tend to be present/past oriented and Im not always good at making or thinking about future goals.\n
2	I've noticed that my Si usually manifests in regards to emotions + memories and when I'm trying to picture something in my head - I might hear a certain song, and then my brain may become flooded with memories and emotions and nostalgia and pictures of exactly what was happening, what I was feeling, what I was thinking, who I was with or who it's directed at, etc. (Sometimes it's really inconvenient actually)\n\nIn general, being a visual learner, when I try to picture something in my head, I've noticed I always link it to other things - my thought process will literally go:\n"Picture an apple."\n"I've seen an apple on a tree in this game I've played recently. I saw Megan eating an apple on Monday, right? My cousin always liked to eat apples in class." \n\nVisual links & all. 
3	Why does my ISFJ friend seem unsupportive?	Hi ISFJs. I would like some advice or input from your perspective.\n\nI (25F, INFP) have had a best friend for 19 years (25F, ISFJ). We met in school and stayed close through college. Our differences in personality seemed to grow stronger near the end of our senior years, but at this point the two of were essentially family. She is like my sister, and I can't ever see not having a relationship with her. \n\nI moved away from home after graduating and met my current boyfriend (28, INTJ) a year ago, who I now live with. My best friend has met him twice. The first time was over lunch in my home town, the second time was when she came to visit for the day in the city I live in now. \n\nThe problem is, I don't think she likes him.\n\nOver Easter, my boyfriend visited with me again and I asked my best friend if she would want to try having a double date with us. I had already spent several days with her to catch up (her boyfriend was with us at that time). I really like her boyfriend. I want her to have a similar relationship with mine, but she never seems interested in spending much time around him, even though I have told her (we had a big fight about it a few months ago) that this really hurts my feelings.\n\nShe completely skipped the opportunity for us to go out on a double date by not committing or acting enthusiastic about the idea at all. I am pretty sure she spent the evening with her own boyfriend as a pre-Easter couple celebration (they were apart for the actual holiday). I know the two of them are in the honeymoon phase and I want them to be happy... but I don't understand her behavior. This was her one chance to show some initiative and support. My boyfriend and I won't be back in town for at least another 6-8 months.\n\nI don't know if she just feels really protective of me or if this is some other issue. Can any of you shed some light on this for me? I'm tired of being angry at her. I want to make sure we can maintain our friendship without me winding up hating her. But any time I bring it up she never gives me a straight answer (I assume to prevent hurting my feelings). I want to know what she's thinking or figure out how to fix the situation.\n\n**TL;DR:** Don't want to lose my 19-year friendship over my best friend disliking my boyfriend. What is her thought process here? What do I do? 
3	One question that you might want to ask, and it might be a painful one, is whether she's avoiding your boyfriend or avoiding you. \n\nHave there been any times in the past when she really needed someone and you weren't there, or have you ever left her in a position where perhaps she felt stranded? \n\nIf you try to force her into something, I don't think that it will ultimately end up how you want it to, because she will probably begin to resent you for it. Do you feel like you're putting in a lot of work in the friendship and she doesn't reciprocate? Or has that perhaps happened in reverse where you were unreliable, or just generally absent when she was trying to make things work between the two of you?
1	Sometimes I do not like people. You might love your boyfriend, but that does not mean everyone necessarily will. It is probably rude she handled it how she did, and I expect if she is not taking the time to support you maybe she is having personal troubles?\n\nEspecially with an INTJ -- my ex is an INTJ and he was very hard to read at first. Sometimes they can be tactful, other times they are too blunt (for my fragile feelers to handle lol).\n\nI'd try to explicitly ask her about it. Have you asked her if she does not like him? Tell her to be honest and let you know why. Tbh, it might be a silly reason -- for me, my pet peeve is attention whores. So perfectly "nice" people who come across as needy for attention really bug me. She might have another silly reason like me. In my defense, I know the reason is dumb but I can't help to just not like those people because of my past experiences with being ignored/over-shadowed.
8	22 year old ISFJ: Can't decide on career path to take	Hello,\n\nI just finished my fourth year of my English Honors degree, and I thought I wanted to pursue law after graduating, but the more I study for the LSAT, meet lawyers, and visit law firms, the more I feel like a legal career doesn't suit me. I did a personality test, found out that I'm an ISFJ, and found that an attorney is one of the least popular careers for an ISFJ. \n\nI'm also doing well in my English degree, but I can't see myself writing essays for the rest of my life (i.e. I don't think I'll enjoy becoming an academic or journalist).\n\nOne of the jobs listed as being most suitable for an ISFJ was an interior designer. As I've always loved design, art and the concept of space, I'm now considering to pursue an interior design degree. However, that would take another 4 years which I'm not sure I'd be able to handle financially. Instead, I could pursue a masters in elementary education which would only take 2-3 years. I would also be more likely to find a job. \n\nI think both jobs have their pros and cons. I love the idea of designing spaces for people, but daunted by the idea of having to deal with the meticulous architecture details. I also love the idea with working with children, but I get physically worn out very easily.\n\nIf any ISFJs are in either of these careers and could provide me with more insight, I would really appreciate it. Thank you for reading this lengthy post!
2	I am in the same boat with you and Im 25 years! Ive been struggling with this decision since I was a teenager and over the years Ive been narrowing down my options through getting advice and exposure and research. Its not easy decision what to do with the rest of your life and  its an important decision, so you might as well take your time. \n\nI just completed my personality test and realised that im ISFJ also. I tried teaching and it was exhausting to tell you the truth, the kids were wonderful but the work I had to put in was not easy. I taught grades 7-9 and It was tiring, but thats just me. I started college but had to put it on hold for financial reasons, fast foward almost two years later and I have not changed the field I want to continue pursuing studies which is good, because I was all over the place before. \n\nWith all of that being said (sorry I am easily distracted and can get carried away) I think you should not pressure yourself too much which deciding, write down a list with TEN (10) top careers you find most interesting and narrow that list down to FIVE , after which you can do your research, ask folks and browse the internet and look at salary scales and so forth and HOPEFULLY you'll find what you need to focus on. It has been working for me and I hope it does for you as well. BEST WISHES TREESTATION :)
1	Totally in the same boat. It's a really difficult thing, but the best thing you can do is keep going until you find something that really clicks. \n\nAs far as an actual method to trying to find a career, all I can really say is "who do you want to be?". In your heart of hearts, what is that you want?\n\nThink of 15 year old treestation and recall what it was that they wanted to be. I know money is a practical, real life constraint but it's really useful to just set it aside for a moment and ask yourself where you'd like to be and what you'd like to be doing without any question to how feasible it is. Once you've actually answered that question, you can move on to how you can get close to that in the real world. \n\nI don't know if you've ever listened to Alan Watts, but I find him particularly motivating, especially when you're trying to think about who it is you want to be in life. \n\n[What do you desire?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agbsQbMi7x0)
1	My mom tried to push me into law school. It was one of the most stressful experiences of my life. The fact you wanted to do it on your own is promising though.\n\nWhen I did have to consider what I would do if I went to law school and just followed my mom's wishes -- was what would I want to do with a law degree? One thing I thought of was grant-writing. If you do enjoy to write, you can pick something you are passionate about and join a company/non-profit/whatever as a grant-writer and try to help them earn more funding.\n\nPersonally, I started as an English major then switched to Environmental Sciences. I'm currently a part-time Environmental/Nature teacher at a non-profit conservancy. Soon I'm going to be starting a second part-time job as an assistant librarian. The teaching job was very stressful at first -- I would honestly have nightmares before going in to teach and I would also imagine anything that could go wrong. But now that I have been doing it for 3-4 years, I am much more comfortable and it has really helped to improve my public speaking (at least to kids, if not to other adults lol).\n\nedit to add: I also really enjoy working with children. When I was looking for a second job, one of the things I really considered was if I would be helping kids or not. I know it can be physically wearing to be around bubbly balls of energy, but I find when I'm at work and teaching I'm 100% into it and I'm excited to be getting them excited... it's only once I get home that I collapse haha.

I've posted in some of the other type subreddits, but right now we really need more ISFJ data.\n\nhttp://www.literacynet.org/mi/assessment/findyourstrengths.html \nIf you could take this test and comment your results that would be a huge help!\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hYz6JjtkL2ZCS6MtisP1AacC2GI5Ep-FDT87vIemDCg/edit?usp=sharing \nHere is the spreadsheet for those who are interested.

3	Scores: Self- 3.71, Nature- 3.14, Language- 3, Spatial- 3, Social- 2.86, Musical- 2.29, Logic/math- 2, Body Movement- 1.43\n\nIt'll be interesting to see the numbers on this almost more as a measure of self-esteem than anything, honestly. I know I tend to answer things like this erring on the side of caution and tending to take a lower opinion of myself rather than a higher one, which likely skews my scores somewhat. In light of that, seeing ENTJs currently have the highest total score doesn't surprise me lol.

2	Come chat about Personality Theory	Hey everyone! I'm from a Discord server focused around personality typology, emphasis on MBTI but with lots of talk about Jungian theory, socionics, and enneagram as well. We're over a year old, have a nice bot that does things for us like channel and role management, and would like to open the gates to newcomers so we can all have fun. What makes us different than most other Discord servers is that we're more focused on actual discussion and conversation with minimal shitposting (we keep that in the #nsfw channel). With that in mind, please join if you want to discuss Jungian theory, get people to try to figure out your type, want to debate the merits of Socionics vs MBTI, discuss the deeper meaning of your Enneagram, or just want to have a good talk.\n\nSee you there (:\n\nhttps://discord.gg/6xE4qMt\nEdit: If that link expires, use this one: https://discord.gg/ct8BRps
4	We promised we'd share the survey results, well here they are.	A while back, [we asked folks in this community to take a survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/5xbz23/make_your_voice_heard_tired_of_phone_calls/) and you all were kind enough to help us out. This post is a high level summary of the results of that survey.\n\n(Note: for this summary, we will be using the term "[extravert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion)" as used in clinical analysis initiated by Carl Jung instead of the popularized spelling, "extrovert." )\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe Movers & Makers company is engaged in ongoing research about introverts, extraverts, age, occupation, and communication preferences. The original hypothesis was that introverts, or individuals in introvert-friendly occupations such as STEM, were more adverse to having a phone call disrupt their time, with some exceptions. In contrast, extraverts, or individuals in extravert-friendly occupations, were more open to phone calls. Our formal interviews showed this hypothesis to be incorrect and revealed a trend based more on age and occupation than temperament.\n\nAs an informal triangulation of our data, The Movers & Makers research team decided to conduct surveys on popular social media and internet forums. The research has not yet concluded, but "Phase 1" of these informal surveys are complete and we'd like to share the results of these surveys. The results of this informal survey coincided with our formal research and also contradicted the original hypothesis. This summary is not an analysis of our hypothesis, our formal research, or of the informal research. This summary is only a brief overview of the informal survey results.\n\n# Summary\n\nIn addition to essential demographic questions, the questions of the survey took the form of "I work for a company that has never done business with you and I'd like to introduce myself." The possible answers included, "Call your phone number," "Send you an email," "Send you an SMS," "Send you an MMS," and "Send you an IM." We also asked two, somewhat open-ended questions that emphasized the positive and negative consequences of the communication preferences.\n\n## Overall Preferences\n\nOur initial observations, which initiated our research, were that there are some people that don't like to be called on the phone and would prefer to be contacted by other means. This survey supported the observation with less than a third of respondents preferring  a phone call (31.3%) over alternative methods. Email was the preferred method by half of the respondents (49.6%).\n\n[Overall Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/UmRoBq3)\n\nGranted, the spectrum of scenarios may have been biased toward phone-call-aversion, so this is not an absolute reflection of preferences, but merely a summary of the preferences reflected in this survey. \n\n### Introvert-Extravert Preferences\n\nBreaking down the data between introverts and extraverts yielded an insignificant difference between the two temperaments. Introverts preferred a phone call in 30.61% of responses. Extraverts preferred a phone call in 31.41% of responses. This is a difference of only 0.8% and is much smaller than we anticipated.\n\n[Introvert Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/p7S4Djk)\n\n[Extravert Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/9eww0um)\n\nThe similarities between introvert and extravert coincide with our formal research and are also reflected in the breakdown of most of each questions that follow.\n\n#### Ambivert Preferences\n\nWhile "ambivert" is not a part of some personality/temperament models, many contemporary research make allowances for ambiverts. In our case, we are including the term because people that identify as ambiverts seem themselves as distinct from both extraverts and introverts and they may have a distinct profile. However, the number of respondents describing themselves as Ambiverts is too small to comprehensively study and we recommend a more in-depth study of ambiverts and communication preferences.  Still, as a note of interest, we'll include the results here, though we caution against drawing any conclusions. Ambiverts responded with a preference for email at 54.6% and phone calls at 19.2%.\n\n[Ambivert Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/5CHYPha)\n\n### Male-Female Preferences\n\nOur original hypothesis did not account for sex or gender. We allowed for the selection of "sex" in the survey to satisfy any curiosity of biological temperament selection. As we suspected, there isn't a large or significant difference in correlation of sex to communication preferences as borne out in our formal research and reflected in these survey results.\n\n[Male Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/VeC5EeV)\n\nOverall, male respondents selected a preference for a phone call in 34% of responses with females selecting phone calls in only 28.6% of responses. Email was the preferred response for both males and females in 49.3% and 49.7% of responses respectively.\n\n[Female Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/Npq6ZeS)\n\n#### Gender and Non-traditional Genders\n\nWe specifically did not include the word "gender" in this survey because the study of gender is outside of the scope of our current research. We allowed for the answers of "Prefer not to say," and "Other" with an open field to promote the completion of the survey, but this survey is not equipped to tackle gender. Even with this allowance, only 0.1% of respondents answered with a non-traditional sex. Of that 0.1%, some of the respondents showed open hostility to the survey in their comments, indicating that this answer was not truly reflective of the respondent. The answers from these respondents were removed from our analyzed results.\n\nThat does not mean, however, that we do not value research regarding gender. We believe that the identification of gender and that correlation to communication preference might be quite significant. It is simply that we have not begun to tackle the question at this time. We would openly welcome input or recommendations from anyone with knowledge or expertise in this area.\n\n### Generational Preferences\n\nThe first of two areas with distinctive responses is the difference in generation. The age groups that we call "Millennials" are the least resistant to phone calls, with 31.6% of responses, and yet 48.4% of the Millennial responses prefer email. Millennials were also more open to "alternative" communication methods such as IM, SMS, etc. with about 20% of the responses in total.\n\n[Millennial Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/fJBFPKj)\n\nThe age groups that we call "Generation X," or "Gen X," are slightly more resistant to phone calls with only 29.1% of responses preferring a phone call and 57.3% preferring email.\n\n[Gen X Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/mAotSZr)\n\nThe age groups that we call "Baby Boomers," or just "Boomers" are the most resistant to phone calls with only 23.6% of responses preferring a phone call and 72.7% preferring email. Boomers were the most resistant to "alternative" communication methods with only 3.6% of responses for SMS and zero responses for the other methods.\n\n[Boomer Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/U7Yng1Z)\n\n### Occupational Preferences\n\nThe second of two areas with distinctive responses is the difference in occupation, or, occupational "wings" as we call them. These wings are simply divided into occupations that are [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics)-related and non-STEM-related. The survey results reinforced our formal research and part of our hypothesis that respondents in STEM-related fields are more resistant to phone calls than their non-STEM peers. Respondents in STEM-related fields responded with 23.5% of responses preferring phone calls and 57.4% preferring email.  \n\n[STEM-Related Occupation Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/QnwxZOc)\n\nResponses in non-STEM-related occupations were more receptive to phone calls, but only with 34.2% of the responses and 46.7% preferring email.\n\n[non-STEM-Related Occupation Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/LMluzrF)\n\n## Scenario Preferences\n\nWe asked respondents to imagine a range of hypothetical scenarios and how they'd prefer to be contacted in those scenarios. The scenarios spanned a variety of business-oriented communications that fall onto a spectrum what we term "cold to hot" in order indicate the amount of familiarity the two parties have already established. We also asked about preferences in various degrees of urgency and responsibility.\n\nIt is probably unsurprising that the more distant and less urgent relationships are the most resistant to phone calls and the nearest and more urgent relationships are the most receptive to phone calls. In the "coldest" scenario, *I work for a company that has never done business with you and I'd like to introduce myself*, responses were predictably low on preferring a phone call with only 8% of responses and 85% preferring email. In this scenario, the differences between introvert and extravert were negligible, but the differences in generation were in-line with the overall responses. STEM and non-STEM responses were also in agreement with the overall responses.\n\n[Cold Business Introduction Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/65J1a3r)\n\nAlso, predictably, the "hottest" scenario, *I have an emergency (business emergency, not life or death)*, included 74.6% of responses favoring a phone call and 5.9% preferring email. As an interesting note, in this scenario, more respondents preferred SMS to email with 13.7% of the responses.\n\n[Emergency Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/IOxd25R)\n\nThe scenarios that emphasized cool or hot combined with responsibility, however, were a little surprising. For the scenario, *I'm a customer with a question (it's your responsibility to answer customer questions),* the responses were similar to the warm business responses. 19% of responses preferred a phone call for customer questions and 72.2% of responses preferred email.\n\n[Cool Customer Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/2FOARrW)\n\nThe scenario, *I'm a customer with a problem (it's your responsibility to handle customer problems),* showed a surprising 61% preferring email and only 31.2% preferring a phone call.\n\n[Hot Customer Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/FbwgWnW)\n\n## Consequences\n\nWe were also interested in understanding what impact these preferences have on the communication recipient. We set up a pair of questions in the survey to give respondents a chance to demonstrate the perceived consequences, both positive and negative. The negative consequences include, "I mostly roll with it--no big deal" (16.8%), "I find it irritating and frustrating" (24.3%), and "The interruption negatively affects my work" (16.5%), as well as, "I may decide not to reply or continue communication" (17.8%). The most damaging consequences would be "I lose some respect for the person contacting me" (7.3%), and "I may block that person, or mark their contact as 'spam' or 'junk'" (6.5%).\n\n[Negative Consequences Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/RbL1A2Q)\n\nConversely, when the respondents' preferences were respected, there were positive consequences, including, "It helps me manage my schedule" (14.3%), "I feel I'm more productive and efficient" (13.9%), "I believe I can dedicate the proper amount of attention to the communication" (21.5%), "I'm less irritated" (20%), and "It reduces my anxiety" (18.8%).\n\n[Positive Consequences Response Breakdown](http://imgur.com/laUXrVA)\n\n# Conclusion\n\nOur initial observations were that most people don't like receiving phone calls. Perhaps it's no mystery that the manner in which communication technology evolved puts the telephone front-and-center to business communication. However, our ongoing research shows that most people find phone calls to be disruptive and intrusive. Using the phone as a primary source of communication could be damaging to business relationships and to the overall economic health of our collective society. \n\nLooking at this research, we can see why "cold calling" feels ineffective and like "a waste of time" to many people. "Cold emails" are more likely to be effective and seem to have a lower downside. In fields like recruiting, it may be damaging for the hiring side of the relationship to initiate contact with a phone call. \n\nYes, the research is ongoing, but it seems relatively clear that the phone should not be the first point of contact in any scenario, unless we know for certain that the recipient would prefer a phone call or we know for certain that the purpose of the contact is an emergency (the definition of "emergency" is somewhat subjective and needs to be judiciously applied). In business scenarios, the least risky option for contacting anyone is to use email and the most risky is to use alternative methods like MMS, or even IM. But, phone calls seem equally risky by the same standards considering that email seemed to dominate the responses.\n\nAs an illustration of the resistance to phone calls, this is a comment from the survey, "I hate phone calls, almost unconditionally.  Texting or e-mails are always preferable unless it's really an emergency." And, another comment, "I do not generally like speaking on the phone because it's a purely auditory activity, and I am a visual person... I like time to process what's going on and formulate a response, otherwise I feel flustered and anxious." These and several other comments are reflective of the overall tone of this survey. There were no equivalent comments showing resistance to email. \n\nOur research currently only analyzes the state of things as they are, not *why* things are as they are. For example, why are Boomers more resistant to phone calls than Millennials? Why are STEM-related occupations more resistant to phone calls than non-STEM-related fields? Why are extraverts as equally resistant to phone calls as introverts? What is the significance of gender in communication preference? How might this study be different if we focused on personal scenarios instead of business scenarios?\n\nAll of these questions push us to recommend further research in this area. We know that we are continuing to research this area, but our small contribution covers only a fraction of needed research.\n\nWe will begin "Phase 2" of this research soon. If you're interested in participating, keep a watch on our blog for updates. This topic will remain a topic of interest for The Movers & Makers Company and our research is ongoing. If you are interested in this research or our other research, please [contact us](mailto:researchers@moversandmakers.xyz); but, please refrain from calling us on the phone, it's so disruptive.\n\nYou can find a copy of this article over on [Medium](https://medium.com/@michaelallenwilliamson/phone-call-or-email-or-informal-survey-results-a4d07e6c392a) if you'd like to read the article with the chart images in-line.
20	Anybody else with a low self-esteem?	Maybe it's the genetics, maybe it's the way i was raised, I lack confidence in myself. I think this has something to do with ISFJ perfectionism, like when I put in serious effort in what i do but still fail or pale in comparison to other people, I would get really discouraged and begin self-blaming and pitying (not a real word?). I feel like I want to strive to be the absolute best, and I consciously know that is impossible for a normal guy like me, but deep down I can not acknowledge this fact, and my sensitivity introduced a whole array of negative emotions whenever my inferiority is proven. My point is, I feel like I can only be loved or valued if I am the best aka perfect. After all, the society loves the best, the strongest, the smartest, the fastest, the best-looking, the wittiest, etc etc. \nI hope I haven't typed a bunch of nonsense, and I hope to exchange experiences with people alike. How do I counter this thinking? Hoping for replies.
14	I completely relate to this.  I find it frustrating how I can logically know I have low self-esteem and yet not be able to reason with myself until I improve it.  This may be the least helpful advice ever, but I'll tell you what has worked for me:\n\n\n1) Not caring.  \nWhen I just focus on what I'm trying to be good at, rather than how I think I'll be judged, I'm more at peace and can leave negative emotions aside.  I mainly learned this from art/painting, in that overthinking whether my work-in-progress is good enough will completely paralyze the entire art process.\n\n\n2)Pretending my best friend just did whatever mistake I'm beating myself up about.  \nI would never ever treat the people I love the way I treat myself, so this helps me to re-frame my perspective and give myself some compassion.
5	Take this with a grain of salt but acknowlegde that you're, in a way, 99% a product of environment until you're somewhat in your 20's. It is not your fault you lack self-esteem, it is because of your environment. If your parents had raised you just a little bit different, you maybe could've had high self-esteem. Now don't start resenting your parents, they did their best. But now it is up to you to start taking the reins and start developing that self-esteem :)  There are enough retards running around who are much less capable than you and have more self-esteem, because of their environment, parents, peers, teachers etc...\n\nNow for the advice, look into and research the following topics and make your own routine/practice after you learn about these topics. No one knows you better than you, so you need to make a practice/routine that fits your needs (developing self-esteem) and goals.\n\nTopics:\n\n- Sport, excercise and diet\n\n- Read books, try to avoid fiction. Look for popular self-help books and read the reviews\n\n- Start journalling, get a sense of whats going on. Get to know your thougths, ideas, identity, patterns, reactions, weaknesses, strengths etc etc... get to know your problem in depth\n\n- Learn about self-help, philosophy, psychology, the subconscious etc... Youtube is filled with great content\n\nPS Don't try to implement this all right away, take it reaaaally slow, enjoy the small victories, be very patient, have fun while doing so and keep going :)\n\nPSS message me if you have questions 
6	How do you make yourself productive?	I rarely make lists because I am lazy and feel like it's a lot of work. However, I have found that if I want to be really productive, I need to make a list. Even if it's the most minuscule things that I need to do, I write it down and then go through and do the list easiest to hardest. Crossing things off of my list gives me a high. What helps you get productive?
4	i make lists as well.\n\nanother way is to tie the thing i have to do with a person. the obligation makes it hard to skip.\n\nthere are a few responsibilities i've gotten down to an automatic reflex. turning them into habits i don't even have to tell myself i need to do.\n\nthose methods work best but i've been really trying to work toward cementing a lifestyle of "you do things because you want to" and it's hard but i'm making progress. \n\ni'd be so amazing if i can just do stuff that are hard without thinking "this sucks"! and take needed breaks/downtime without thinking "i'm lazy and should be doing something"! both hard stuff and rest times become equally exciting and wanted because they're all steps toward my goals. i'm like 20-30% there.
3	I'm not really good with lists because I find that I get more preoccupied with finding tasks (important or otherwise) to add to list than I am with actually completing the things on said list.\n\nMaking schedules, on the other hand, has worked out really well for me. Like from x hour to y hour, I'll do task 1, then a little break after and then the next task. I think this helps me because I can see a definitive "end" to when I can stop doing a task I don't particularly like, if that makes sense. And it's also an extra thing to hold me accountable otherwise I'll spend hours upon hours being useless in bed. It takes slightly longer to plan out than a regular list but I'm definitely more productive if I have a schedule.\n\nAlso turning off/hiding my phone. I am *obsessed* with my phone (not sure if that's an ISFJ thing or just a me a thing) and will check it every two minutes which can be a huge hindrance to productivity haha
2	Need advice/insight from an ISFJ	I'm not sure if this is ok to post here but I need advice. I'm an INFJ for reference.\n\nI have this ISFJ friend that I have been best friends with for several years. I've noticed that she has been rather distant lately. I've also noted that she hasn't really made an effort to hang out with me. The times that I would reach out to her, via text, she would claim she hadn't read the message, even though the read receipts were on.\n\nIn the moments that I would hang out with her, it would seem like she didn't want to be there with me. She doesn't speak much, and when I ask her a question, she usually gives very short answers. I found this strange because she used to be very talkative around me.\n\nI'm not sure what I did wrong to her, since I am always considerate to her feelings. Do any of you guys know why she is asking this way? What do you guys think of all this? Do you think she doesn't want to be friends with me anymore?
3	Mm, it's kind of hard to say. I can get like that for two reasons; either if I'm trying to distance myself from someone because I don't want them around anymore, or because I'm going through a really difficult patch and I just don't have the energy to be around other people. I would say probably the only way to figure out what's going on with her is just to flat-out ask her. If she's trying to avoid you she might try to play it off depending on how she handles conflict, but for me personally if it's a "rough patch" issue, I might try to downplay how bad it is but I wouldn't totally deny it. 
3	How do you show physical affection and comfort others?	I often find myself in situations where I genuinely want to hug or talk to someone because I know/see they're not doing well but I stop myself because I think I might come out as annoying or weird\n\nFor example a few days ago I saw my classmate/friend crying while she was talking to her friend about something and I wanted to help her somehow but I thought I would've been annoying if I tried to because I'm probably not the person she'd want next to her in that moment and I wouldn't have really known what to say either\n\nThis probably doesn't make much sense and I'm posting this to vent, but do things like this happen to anyone else?
2	If you don't have any meaningful advice to give then don't approach anyone. That being said, should you find yourself in the position to give advice hand on the shoulder works best. Not as invasive as a hug, just be sure to engage them in conversation first. Don't grab people's shoulders out of nowhere. 
2	I don't like to let people in. A hug will do that. However, if someone really needs it, I will give them one but I hate contact with people. A hug to me means that they matter, or I do, and once someone realises that, they will abuse and hurt you.
1	Ugh, yes. I'm huge on physical affection, and people I know very well and am comfortable with will get snuggled relentlessly, but for people I'm not as close to, I always feel *so* awkward about it. I always want to hug or pat or lean against people, but like you, I worry a lot about crossing a line and making them uncomfortable, so I usually refrain :/ I think it's a bit of good old fashioned ISFJ overanalyzing/social anxiety at work. We don't have the guts to just go ahead and do what we want because our Fe makes us worry so much about making others uncomfortable lol. 
1	I have this weird thing about personal space. I try to give people as much space as possible, even though Im not really opposed to have people I like close to me. Probably makes me come across as someone who doesnt wanna be touched.\n\nI mainly do it by asking dumb questions and just being there. 
12	How do I make my amazing ISFJ wife feel more appreciated and/or loved?	Help me /r/ISFJ, you're . . . a resource I haven't ~~exploited~~ mined for ideas yet.   Basically, I got a problem, and I'm hoping you wonderful people can help.\n\nHere's the deal, my wife is an ISFJ (as you may have gathered by now).  *I* on the other hand, am an INTP.  You know, the emotionally barren, lost in their own thoughts all the time, so not noticing all the little amazing, incredible things their loving, nurturing spouse *does* for them constantly.\n   \nNow, to be fair, I've learned *a lot* over the years so I'm not (generally) as bad as the end of that previous paragraph might make me sound.  \n   \nThat said, I want to be *better.*  \n   \nI want tricks and tips.  I want cheat codes.  I want ideas that will take her by surprise and make her *feel* appreciated more deeply than just words, or hugs, or flowers can.\n    \nThis type of thing goes against my natural tendencies, but, knowing that she's so wonderfully *different* (coughbettercough) than I am, makes this particular little puzzle very, very interesting to me.\n   \nAs you may guess, if you're prone to thinking along such lines, her "love language" is "acts of service."  I *kind of* understand this, at least in a theoretical aspect, but as a poster child INTP, I'm borderline *irrationally* independent, so it's a hard lens for me to view the world through for very long.  What she can view as sweet and helpful, I can see as kind of insulting and intrusive.  Sooooo, there's that.  It's a pretty stark contrast.\n   \nWhat that actually *means* is that I'm positive that I miss all kinds of little opportunities to help her out with things that she would appreciate, because they just don't occur to me.  If she's doing something, I just sort of assume that she's got it handled and that if she needs/wants help, she'll all for it.  Somehow,I feel like that's not the right perspective to have on this instance though.  So, what kind of signals do I look for to know when to jump in for the assist?\n    \nBeyond just trying to "be helpful" to her rather than being helped by her . . . what can I do?  Just expand on that same theme?  Declare a "mom's weekend" where I do all the cooking, cleaning, shopping, childcare,  petcare, etc.?  I'm up for that, but she's *horrible* at being bored.  And, since she's such a champ at taking care of other people all the time, she doesn't really have (or even really want?) any real hobbies or fun, time-wasting activities that she enjoys.  As impossible as it sounds (to my kind), helping other people out actually *recharges* her batteries.  WTH?!  How is that even fair to the rest of us?\n    \nI just feel like no little gesture I can make can ever be significant enough to show the gratitude she deserves for being the wife and mother that she is.  But I also find that conclusion unacceptable.\n    \nSo, if it were *you*, and someone who loves you (but sometimes is pretty retarded about displaying it) wanted to just absolutely *melt* you . . . what could that lovable little retard do to sweep you off your feet?\n   \n*Any* ideas or suggestions you folks might have will be greatly appreciated.\n   \nThanks!
6	Well, my mother and I are both ISFJs, so I can tell you about how things are from our perspectives at least. \n\nBasically how I interact with my mom to express my gratitude and affection is to go out of my way to help with tasks I know she doesn't enjoy (or offer to do them entirely), or go out of my way to thank her and show my appreciation for the effort she puts in. For example, she cooks for the family every night, but she doesn't always enjoy it, so if I'm up to it, I'll offer her help by chopping up ingredients or stirring pots or washing dishes to make the task go faster and easier. If I'm not paying attention while she's cooking or don't want to help, I'll make sure I thank her for the meal, make sure to show I'm excited for it if it's something I really like, and once in a while as I'm rinsing my dishes I might go out of my way to say something like, "Thank you for always cooking such great meals for us, you're the best." Similar strategies can be applied to other day to day tasks, and me and my dad always make sure to encourage her not to cook just because she feels obligated on days when she really doesn't feel like it. Basically just showing appreciation for what she does for us and doing little things to make her life easier where we can (my dad often does the vacuuming for her, or cooks a snack supply of hardboiled eggs for the week so she doesn't have to). \n\nPersonally, I'm pretty much the same, but I also like compliments a lot. If someone goes out of their way to do something small for me like bring me tea or get my laundry out of the dryer for me, it makes me extremely happy. Personally, the bigger the task/amount of effort that goes into it, the happier it makes me. Bringing me tea is a really lovely gesture, but going out of your way to run to the store to get something I want/need or taking care of a chore while I'm working on a project will make me feel extremely cared for and warm and fuzzy. Obviously those are larger, more occasional gifts, and I certainly never ever *expect* them, but for me, someone really going out of their way to show that they care about my needs and want to make my life more pleasant even if it's not super convenient for them is like, a huge deal. \n\nCompliments are also great, though! My self esteem usually isn't that great, so somebody showing appreciation for something I've created or a quality I have makes me really happy. Telling me I'm smart or cute or have done a good job on something or you're impressed with something about me is a great way to give my mood a little boost and make me feel like you're really paying attention and care about me. \n\nI have to say though, any gesture is really appreciated. I think it might be a high Fe thing, but I generally feel very protective of people's attempts to be kind or helpful, and I always appreciate the sentiment, even if the thing itself isn't ideal. Anyway sorry this got so long, I hope it's useful to you! And it's really great that you appreciate your wife so much and want to show it, I'm happy for both of you! :) 
3	do things before she asks you to eg do the housework before she asks you to. honestly, i love when i come home and my partner has done all the housework WITHOUT me having to ask. just little things to make her life easier and show you're thinking about her. see something in the shop she likes? her favourite chocolate? favourite candle. just pick it up and gift it to her. little things are important too.
2	* Hmm how about instead of fully taking over the chores she enjoys doing.. why not split it? Do 'em together.\n* Even if she seems/gets embarrassed just any random little positive affectionate comments about/to her will make her happy\n* As far as "time-wasting" hobbies go.. have you tried getting her to try getting her into the ones you like doing? I personally love doing a hobby if I can get engaged somehow with someone (even if it's just a simple as talking about how much we like a show).\n
2	I am ISFJ, and my boyfriend is INTP, as well, so I can relate a lot with your struggle. Some things that work for us:\n\nWhen I talk about my feelings, he listens, and if I'm stressed or upset, when he asks me how he can help, that helps me feel loved and safe and cared for.\n\nWhen he remembers the little things I've talked about wanting to do or buy, like a specific concert or a food that I enjoy, and makes it happen.\n\nI always notice when he does chores, and it helps me feel supported.\n\nWhen he verbally praises me, thanks me, or acknowledges my hard work.\n\nWe have specifically set time to be together. I know he needs his alone time (and I need alone time, too), so we plan together time and we plan alone time. On that note, we'll often be in separate rooms working on our own things. But I absolutely love it when he comes in to give me a quick kiss or a hug. Or if we're in different places, little love texts are great.\n\nWhen he cooks dinner so I can work on an important task.\n\nWhen he remembers something I've talked about experimenting with in the bedroom.\n\nOne of the biggest things is that I have to make sure that I know my own needs and communicate them with him. So, it's helpful for him to say to me that he is here for me and that he wants to hear what he can do for me. That way, I feel comfortable stating my needs to him. When he follows through, I feel supported and loved.\n\nWhen he opens up with me and shares personal things, I know it's hard for him because he doesn't always know how to explain. But hearing his personal stories, struggles, and feelings, makes me feel really special. I know he doesn't disclose these sorts of things to pretty much anyone, so I love hearing about it. That may sound counterintuitive because you're trying to help her feel loved and appreciated rather than putting a burden on her, and maybe she is not the same as me, but being confided in makes me feel appreciated.\n\nI hope some of that can help. (:
1	INTJ female here with an ISFJ SO. I feel your pain. You aren't alone, lol. I'd pair her "mom's day" with a gift card to a spa or manicure, that way she's out of the house and not bored while you clean. That could also help you in the sense of maybe you just do a few chores and cook dinner that night instead of having to take over EVERYTHING for a whole weekend.\n\nMy SOs love language is Acts of Service, too, but he's also very Spending Time, which we have in common. I wonder if they'd have that in common as well since they're both ISFJ?
1	Taking care of shit without being asked and not making it a big deal. Doing small things that show you remembered a small detail she shared with you (paying attention and really tuning in). Surprising her with random gestures that serve no other purpose then to make her happy; nothing flashy, $$, but reminiscent of the old days maybe? Anything sacrificial and out of your own comfort zone really. It can be something you do or refrain from doing too. Something for her family or other people she loves. I can't imagine one grand gesture that would blow my socks off but small things here and there and the effort in making it a regular routine or part of your life together would mean a lot.
0	Random acts of Amazon. Get your hands on that wishlist, buddy. 
4	Dealing with breakup as an ISFJ	Hi guys, what are things/ways you guys deal with breakups? My ex and I have been broken up for a few weeks now, and I'm having a hard time moving on and keeping her out of my mind. 
6	A lot of ways, but it still sucks. Your mind will get you stuck in loops of dumb logic. You will have less compassion for emotional leeches. You may think it was the best time ever and fantasize the heck out of her good qualities (throw in a lotto win for extra drama, it may not seem out of place.) Other times you may feel weak for not breaking sooner or for being so affected.\n\nWrite a list of why she wasn't good for you. \nWrite another list of your deal breakers for anyone. \n\nTake time to do things you like to do. Take it easy, binge on tv, workout... find a new balanced day. You are investing in yourself.  What would you advise your best friend to do? You're worth it, dude. Your world needs you.
3	Keep yourself from still obsessing over them and block them on social media - not for their sake but yours. I know it's easy at least for me to get stuck in a loop and feel tempted to see what they're up to. I've found though that completely cutting yourself off from seeing anything in their life helps me forget about them more quickly and move on. I took a week to completely mope when my boyfriend broke up with me. When I felt like crying I went into a bathroom and cried and then picked myself up and went back to work. You can get through this! Let me know if you need anything or just someone to talk to
2	I had to cut someone out of my life in December, and I still struggle with it. I think what's helped the most is when I've felt the worst, I gave myself permission to put my needs first. If you're like me, you tend to put others' needs ahead of your own, sometimes to your detriment. Take a break from taking care of people other than you. Spend a night doing whatever makes you happy. Or, hell, a week!
1	everything everyone said here is gold. this isn't super direct advice, it's kind of like a side bit.\n\nfocus on something for yourself for a while. for me and a bunch of my friends, it was working out. it doesn't need to be exercise, it can be any hobby really, but it's what we do. 1st big heartbreak? you gotta work out buddy and you get a work out buddy. \n\n1) I/we do this to kind of force the friend to hang out with us to they don't spiral in their sadness.\n\n2) they now have an activity to do that they can focus on. giving them breaks to their sad times\n\n3) the activity comes with both long term and short term goals that are achievable. that stuff sticks with you, you can obsess about them outside of the gym especially like counting protein and cutting calories or carbs.\n\n4) hitting goals feels good and exercise releases happy hormones.\n\nit's all about finding new outlets for happiness and hope. friends, goals, self improvement instead of that one person. doesn't have to be working out it's just gotta be something that you can dedicate yourself to for a while with friends and hit goals or achievements.
2	Hey fellow more emotionally mature friends I have an old friend wanting to be friends again and I'm not sure what to do	By nature, I think that ISFJs tend to let people walk over them. I know I definitely let people run me over and bring me down. I had a friend for almost four years and she was basically a sister to me and we had been living together for two years. Then a few months ago we started fighting and sat down to talk it all out. She basically told me she didn't want to be friends after we graduated college. That hurt me unbelievably bad. Since I was graduating a semester early I kind of slipped out of the friendship as quietly as possible. She texted me yesterday that she wants to hang out and be friends again and that she understands how hurtful she has been in the past (she has proven herself a bad friend on multiple occasions such as taking other people's sides against me, repeating confidential information I told her, and being incredibly cruel with things she has said to me in a very judgmental way). What would you do? I miss her and want to be friends again but I'm afraid this is just me letting myself be taken advantage of. 
3	Living together can be hell on a relationship. You know she can hurt you so it's a gamble.\nI recommend  having firm boundaries like not sharing confidential material and not being the fixer all the time. People should be entitled to their own struggles so they can mature. Don't be a crutch.\nYou control how much contact you have unless she's  unstable  (if so, don't you put yourself through that).\n\nSome people are meant to be part of your past. There is no shame in walking away. \n\nThere is really no bad choice if you are prepared for either outcome.\n\nBest of luck.
2	Maybe she has changed, so I would suggest reconnecting to give her a chance and see if she has.\n\nBUT I wouldn't re establish the relationship unless you feel that you can cut it off once again, in the case that she hasn't changed and is still not a good friend.  \n\nRespect yourself, your time is precious. You have the right to spend your time building and maintaining relationships with people who make you  happy and support you properly. 
1	What about your Si?	It's one of the two functions I have trouble wrapping my head around. How do you define your Si? The more details, the better for me though I understand you might not want have the time to go too much into those details.\n\nThanks in advance
1	Hello! I just wanted to point out quickly that there was a similar post a week or two ago that got a few answers; this subreddit isn't that active, so you can scroll down a bit and find it fairly easily. \n\nI'm still happy to answer you and I'm sure other people will too! But since I just woke up and don't really have the brainspace right this second, I thought maybe you'd be interested in reading that other post while you wait on responses :) 
6	What are you most proud of yourself?	I start: I'm proud of pursuing the career I want despite of being afraid of changing fields. Let's bring a bit of self love to this sub! 
4	I'm proud of myself for wanting and trying to get better, as a mildly depressed, probably ADHD, currently unemployed college dropout. And I'm proud of myself for saving my money, and for finally learning to crochet so I can make beautiful things. \n\nI think that's all I've got right now, but hopefully the list will start to grow again soon. Thanks for making this post! A little self-appreciation is a good thing once in a while :)
3	Right now, I'm proud of moving on from a dwindling relationship so well. My boyfriend, an esfp, apparently lost interest, but I guess just being nice, let me continue to be infatuated and hang around him. He was gradually less nice as time went on and eventually I was the one doing all the work. But, as a man myself, I made my peace with the truth that he was communicating through his actions that he'd lost interest. So I confronted him, also proud of that, in a kind and listening manner asking how things were. I knew full well that I'd not like the answer, but I could also tell that he didn't want to continue going out. In the spirit of fairness I offered him an out, he didn't take it right away, said he needed to think about it, but 4 days later decided he wasn't willing to keep the relationship. I do worry for him, he is a good guy, and I fear he might be getting down on himself, I know that was what I was expecting of myself. But I'm proud of how I took charge in the relationship by slowing it down for a minute and evaluating it with my ex, working together one more time to realize it wasn't going anywhere good. I'm proud that I was a part of a relationship that did wonders for my self-confidence. Ultimately though, I'm proud that he's the one losing out, and not me, but I have him to thank for that. He'll always have a place in my heart as will volleyball and sweet tea, both things he introduced to me.  \n\nThank you for providing me the venue to actually say all that "aloud." I appreciate you! 
3	I'm proud of myself for breaking up with my looooooong term boyfriend, and then after that focusing on just me. :)
3	I know I'm a good person. For all my mistakes, shortcomings and other flaws, I am a good person. I treat others with respect, and I am very selfless. 
2	I'm proud of myself for getting this far, for being happy, for beating down my anxiety, putting myself out there a little, and for taking better care of myself in general.
1	A semi distant friend once said to me "I could see you being America's Caesar"
1	i'm proud that i am not a jerk. and that i can keep trying to be less and less of a jerk every day.
1	I'm proud that no matter how shitty my life circumstances are, I still get out of bed every morning and go to work no matter how much I don't want to. 
-1	I would have something to be proud of, if I wasn't about calling on that "self love" as circlejerk.\n\nI'm an hopeless jerk. I don't even try to hide it anymore. I wear it.\n\nAnd that's not even my worst mark of shame. I collect them like we used to collect Pin's in the 90's.\n\nPride isn't a capital sin for nothing.\n\n---\n\nPS : Heh, called it. It do is a circlejerk. A hugbox circlejerk, for those who like precision and accuracy. I remain true to my words. Ignoring and punishing by votes won't do anything. You'll need to face me and talk to me : I don't see why I should do anything differently in here.
13	Ever wondered how many subscribers there are in each of the MBTI subreddits? Well I collected the data in this post. Tell me your interpretation of the results.	general MBTI subreddit: 14,701\n\nall SJs: 8,137 // \nESTJ: 745 // \nESFJ: 732 // \nISTJ: 4,055 // \nISFJ: 2,605\n\nall SPs: 8,137 // \nESTP: 920 // \nESFP: 804 // \nISTP: 4,447 // \nISFP: 2,205\n\nall NFs: 56,097 // \nENFP: 11,243 // \nENFJ: 3,016 // \nINFP: 22,166 // \nINFJ: 19,672\n\nall NTs: 75,270 // \nENTP: 9,400 // \nENTJ: 4,167 // \nINTP: 31,444 // \nINTJ: 30,259\n\nCompare the numbers with this estimated frequency of personality types: https://mypersonality.info/personality-types/population-gender/\n\nNote: I'll be posting this on all of the MBTI subreddits.\n
10	Unsurprised by the huge number of INxxs, considering that almost every introvert I know has (mis)typed that way at one point or another lol. I've met far, far more supposed intuitives online than sensors despite the current statistics about type frequency. \n\nIt does make me laugh about there being so few extroverts comparatively, though. Better things to do, I guess? Good for them. 
7	Introverts being introverts i guess.\nalso, the lowest frequency in personality types are the ones with the most subscribers. i guess we start looking for people who can understand us in the internet when we can't find ones in the real world
3	A lot of introverts come to this website, and a lot of debaters/thinkers who like to share their opinion. ESFJs have actual lives outside of Reddit.
13	ISFJ on group conversations	I am a 24 years old ISFJ and group conversations are quite difficult for me to handle. I do not have social anxiety though. And I do understand people do not have to get along well with everybody. I like observing a lot and paying attention on people, but I seem to have some delays with reactions/responses when I'm on group conversations, specially. I was hoping that more ISFJs would agree with me and maybe share a strategy or book that helped you engage and make better conversations with people. *please!*\n\nThanks in advance.
3	I wish I knew. Sorry for not having anything more usefull to share. Had to check that it wasn't a post I had made because it was so accurate with what I experience.\n\nI'll be checking here to learn the strategies other isfj are using. Please share
2	Since we're considerate and don't want to interrupt anybody you have to find the openings where you can go in. \n\nYou may have to overtake a person but sometimes if you really want to get your point across you just have to assertivley say it and make sure to not talk too quietly or too loudly. Loud enough to make your point known.\n\nIt can be difficult but just practice. Try to set small goals that for each conversation you want to say something in, find an opening to say your thoughts and people acknowledging it. It'll feel good!
2	So, I have been researching a bit.. And apparently, this book could help: 8 Keys of Self Leadership by Dario Nardi. It suppose to help us work on/develop our cognitive functions. I'm hoping another ISFJ already read it and might be willing to share the experience. If it was helpful or not. :) 
7	What does your mind look like? How do you see the world?	I was talking to an ISFJ friend of mine about what his internal thought processes and organizations look like. I'm trying to find out a bit more about how different or similar S and N types actually are. What do your thoughts look like? Do you think in pictures/words/etc.? Through what lens do you see the world? \nThanks, \nCurious INTP 
5	When casually perceiving things, I tend to use si and fe to gather information and then a little ti to break down the information for entertainment and utility. Can any isfjs corroborate? \n\nFor example, when I sense anything I usually match it to a flurry of small memories and systems and then understand something from it that's interesting. For example, when I pass a well dressed stranger, I think of what kinds of people they look like from my past or in paintings and photographs, and then determine if they are following their seasonal color palette and style guidelines. I synthesize what works and what doesn't for the future. I then try to guess what they must have been thinking when they planned their outfit and combine this with the impression I get from their expression and the way they walk to guess at what kind of person they are. This probably takes about three seconds in nonverbal form. If I have more time, I try to say a phrase that summarizes what I learned from looking at that person aloud in my head to solidify my findings.\n\nOther times, a person or landscape will have such a correspondence to something my past that I latch onto that memory and spiral inward, replaying all the salient memories from that time. I think that's standard for a lot of sentimental types though. 
3	Since I have aphantasia, there's no visual or other sensory component aside from some sound. I suppose I think in a mix of words and just...impressions and feelings. It can be difficult to get from the latter to the former. :| But, I don't think my answer would be the typical one for an ISFJ. :)
2	I honestly think a lot in feelings. I feel a certain way and that is what I base my thoughts off of. Idk maybe I need to implement my thinking more in actual words but I would definitely say it's a mix of words and feelings depending on my mood. Sometimes I can just zone out in my feelings and I know I'm processing but I don't really have words for it. 
2	If I'm thinking about a subject usually I just explain it as if I were teaching it to a class, and talking through it in my head is how I draw conclusions and make the connections that Ns seem to instantly make. \n\nMemories are basically images and chronologies. And if I'm doing something that requires only minimal thought, like cutting grass, I either think about a subject like as I said first or I just focus on what I'm doing. And I do either more or less on demand
1	I think in pictures and metaphors a lot lol. Or just weird stuff... like the symbolic meaning of things that don't necessarily have symbolic meaning.\n\nMemory wise I think I focus a lot on how I was feeling, and how whatever I did affected others.
1	I think in words, but imagine and envision in pictures.
1	Very bleak, and very miserable. I've been told by a lot of people that I have a black and white mentality. It is either 1 or 10 with me. I know there is a lot of beauty in the world, but I'm going through the worst time of my life, so a part of knows it is a wonderful world but all I see is the mess and hell.
4	Have you been able to change?	Hi ISFJs! I'm a 24f ISFJ and although I know our type has very good traits sometimes I'm tired of being so self defeating and feeling overwhelmed by every difficulty I encounter. I also have a hard time when socializing with new people because I'm worried about what they'll think of me. I feel that I'm really reluctant to change because of fear of failing but this time I'm willing to try. I want to be more social, not being afraid of saying my opinion and having the attention of others.\nSo my question is, have you ever been in a similar situation, where you have seen the need to change? Have you been capable of doing it? I've read that personality types cannot be changed and I feel like I resent my way of being, but I find really difficult to believe that I cannot change that.. Soo yeah, let me know your story! \n
3	i try to change all the time. i think the first thing i did was i learned to look at life a specific way. every moment is one of a kind with no take backs, like a test. but also every moment was like a study session for a future exam. \n\nand i needed to emotionally shift my focus from the feeling of going to a party as a test of "are you socially capable?" into studying for a future social interactions. the stakes become lowered. mistakes become more acceptable. and it become easier to understand mistakes as learning experiences.\n\ni try to think of meet the robinsons.
2	well no personality types can't be changed but that doesn't mean you have to adhere to every little stereotype or that you're bound by them.  we make up such a large part of a population, yet none of us are the same, so it makes sense every isfj will be different too. some more introverted, some more assertive and so on. you can change the latter but not your type.\n\ni used to have social anxiety and i do still struggle with saying my opinion sometimes, but i just kind of let myself do it. i know it's really hard and i think i will regret it, but the only way you can do something is to ... do it? the more you do it, the more your mind will understand it's not the end of the world if you do do it, so you'll get the confidence to continue. if that makes sense.
1	This is a pretty boring answer, but: therapy. I went through a really rough patch right around middle school, but through determination and therapy I was able to become a much calmer, more mature and appreciative version of myself. Lately I've been backsliding a lot because of trouble treating my ADHD, but once I get started back on ADHD meds, I'm getting my ass back in therapy again. \n\nAnd about the social anxiety, I'm not great on that front either, but one thing I do to try and relax myself is really examining my thoughts and evaluating how much time I spend thinking about and judging other people. Because honestly, it's not that much, and the judgments are rarely "Ugh, what a piece of shit, I hate that person so fucking much." Maybe it's a passing, "Hm, I liked that shirt," or, "I hope somebody tells them they have something in their teeth." Something pretty mild that I'm bound to forget within a few hours, anyway, and I do think of myself as a pretty judgy person.  \n\nOther people probably judge you similarly! Sure, a few people are bound to hate you, but that's just kind of statistics lol. If you do your best to be a nice person, most people will probably have a mildly to moderately positive impression or just hardly ever think about you at all. We're all our own favorite subject lol. \n\nAnyway, I hope you can figure out a strategy to help you work through this! Being an ISFJ has its ups and downs just like any personality type, but you can stay an ISFJ and still improve yourself! Just the fact that you want to says to me that you'll probably succeed, since a desire for self-improvement is already more progress than some people ever achieve lol. Good luck to you! 
1	Yes. There have been a few times in life where something clicked in my head, and I changed. I did what I felt was necessary in order to overcome the situation. I wouldn't call it changing my personality though. I've always been an ISFJ even when I've been more bold and social. I've always interacted with the world via Si and Fe, and that's something that won't change. The lesser functions will improve and mature over time.
1	I don't think I've changed but more or less adapted.\n\nI'm 26 and I would go through a cycle of the things you are describing. I would feel scared/nervous/etc to be more open, but I do end up trying. Afterwards I just go back into a ball of anxiety.\n\nOver the last couple years, I've kinda just mellowed out somehow. I've accepted what and who i am. What's helped me out these days are hobbies or something to "obsess" about. For me...I've fallen in love with a Korean pop group lol.\n\nWhether or not this will be beneficial for me in the long run is unknown. For now I may not love all of myself but I can't let it slow me down. 
6	Explain Si?	What is Si like for you? How does it work? What does it do?\n\nI want to understand Si better. Based on what various SJ types have said, the canned descriptions are inaccurate or misleading. Therefore I would like your personal ideas about that it is or what it means, or any information you can give me about it.\n
8	To me, it's basically just storing experiences in a sort of "bank" that I pull from to create a frame of reference for myself. \n\nOn the downside, that means that, for example, when I enter a new/unfamiliar situation, I'm often very uncomfortable at first because I have no frame of reference to work from. I'll look to other people and try to follow the patterns I see being displayed in behavior, or do research in advance to try to mitigate the discomfort. Having a familiar person whose example I can follow is also great. Once I adjust to a situation and form my mental framework, though, I'm totally fine. \n\nOn the upside, it means I'm able to make connections between situations and pull from past experiences to improve my current situation. I can judge the ways in which my experiences are dissatisfactory, compare it to similar situations in the past, and see what changes can be made to correct the problem based on solutions I've found in the past. When I was in college, this also benefitted me academically, since I was able to easily make connections between subjects and apply different perspectives to whatever I was learning about, such as applying what I learned in my psych or science classes to my history or philosophy classes. That's how it is for me, anyway. 
3	I'm constantly referring to and comparing to past experiences. Life's experiences and lessons are like many strings that I weave and connect together to create and understand new ideas. If something is completely unfamiliar, it will either put me slightly on edge until I've gained some understanding, or I will find *something* to relate it to, even if it's ridiculous and far fetched.\n\nI find it very enjoyable to revisit good, old experiences, like going to the same restaurant each time I visit a certain area or reading the same books again. (Don't confuse this with being a stick in the mud. I really love to try new things.)
2	really hard for me to explain. for me it occurs in many ways\n\n1) you give me a new concept/theory/information. i look at what i already know, may be something unrelated but helps me understand, and i analyze the new information/concept based on what i already know.\n\nexample: someone talking to me about creating h20 and if it's different to natural h20. me, not knowing a single thing about chemistry, remember about the smallpox virus and how it was eradicted but part of the virus that was being researched seeped through airvents, connected with a photographers chemicals = gave her small pox. so i can use my knowledge of that to say "there may be external circumstances which can change the outcome when creating h20 in a lab". might not be correct but that's based on my limited understanding of the topic. \n\n2) you just anything, could just be one word within a sentence, that has an emotion attached to a memory i have. and i remember it. so you could be talking about a tree and i remember a tree that i looked at from my friends house at a sleepover, i'd have remembered that memory fondly.\n\n3) these ones are less conscious to me. i just hear a piece of information about someone, like their favourite movie. i don't think anything of it. but later i see them talking about movies and i'll suddenly remember what their favourite movie is.\n\n\n4) i have movies, songs and books i can go to if i want to feel a certain feeling. these tend to be associated with the feelings eg "this song was playing when i first met ____, therefore im gonna reply it because it's associated with happy feelings. i replay the same songs from the past. or i replay new songs and then later when i hear them they remind me of the time period i was listening to them and how i was in general.\n\ni dunno it's hard to explain lol and it interacts with Fe particularly and sometimes Ne ^_^
4	Should i let her go?	I have fallen for a girl for a year now ISFJ.  3 months ago, she told me she liked me as well, but I didnt accept her and avoided given her a straight answer because I have to go overseas for half a year for exchange. I dont know why I did that(regret), maybe because I wasnt confident enough at the time. But since leaving, I am now overseas, I found out she was extremely hurt and was crying alone for many nights because she thought i didn't like her and rejected her. After finding this out, I cant stop myself thinking about her. Then last week, she told me she was talking to a guy about all the sadness and found out he really cared for her. I told her my feelings and now she is conflicted. Is it over for us? and she just doesnt want to hurt my feelings, so she's not telling me she's with him? Should i try get her back or will this hurt her more?\n
3	In my opinion, if you show dedication to her without being overbearing and prove that you'll be loyal even if you go overseas or something, I believe it can work.\n\nJust balance between showing you do want her but giving her space when she needs it.
2	[deleted]
2	i don't think it's over particularly but will take a lot of work.  i've been in a similar situation (as the girl) and it made me question everything about the relationship afterwards because i just felt so rejected and hurt and was worried they would do it again. i mean, i really don't want to be in a relationship where intentions and feelings aren't made clear, i need them to share with me how they feel not keep it to themselves because that doesn't make me feel better. it makes me question what you're doing.
1	In my opinion I think it's best to let her go. You've already done damage and ISFJ's have a tendency to get entangled in relationships they know are bad for them, but they do it anyway because they are so forgiving and loyal and want to help fix whatever issue there is. If she had trouble with long distance in the past, I think it's also in your best interest not to become involved with her.
5	Anyone have experience with Si-Ti loops?	I think I may be stuck in one, but I'm not totally sure what that means. Have any fellow ISFJs experienced loops? Could you describe what an Si-Ti loop looks like?\n\nThank you!
5	From:\nhttp://infj-mbti.tumblr.com/post/126404186698/can-you-describe-what-each-loop-looksacts-like\n\n> ISFJ Si-Ti loop: An ISFJ in a Si-Ti loop will replay past events, usually traumatic ones, and relive these past experiences in their head.They will also try to come to a logical reasoning for why these things happened, and overanalyze the situation. However, they would not be able to come to a conclusion and would instead become stuck in this loop of recalling memories and analyzing them. In addition, they lose some of their ability to interact with the outer world in a healthy way, and instead withdraw into themselves and neglecting to talk over their feelings with others in their life.\n\nIve had moments like these\n\nIn addition Ive also had moments where I always try to overly use Ti to constantly find ways why the things Im using are correct and argue for them when in reality I need advice/values from the outside world to Guide me to the right path
3	INFJ/ISFJ answering questions	My INFJ husband and I (ISFJ) are looking for questions for us both to answer in a video. It would demonstrate how we both answer the same questions differently. Can you suggest any questions (perhaps related to everyday life) ? Thanks! 
3	Ways you can see if someone if an ISFJ mistyped as a INFJ or vice versa?
2	What is the difference between how you both reflect on the past and plan for the future?
1	Fun! Here are some of my questions:\n\n* How do you each prefer to spend your free time?\n* How do you both handle conflict?\n* How were you each introduced to MBTI?\n* What are 3 things you admire about the other person's type?\n* Do you both like the same movie and book genres?\n* Which one of you is more outgoing or can handle more time with others (extroverted introvert)?\n* Is the house usually clean and organized since you're both J's (Hehe, I'm surrounded by P's so my space is usually a mess!)?\n* What's one thing you love about being your MBTI type?
1	I think a great example (if you're still working on the video) would be the answer to questions like "What do you want to do?" "What do you want to get for dinner?" "What's your favorite band/song/movie?" \n\n"How was your day?" Would also be a good one. For me the answer to this depends on who asks.\n\nAt least for me I know the answer is usually along the lines of "I don't know, it's whatever you like/want!" and the whole "I don't know" thing drives my INTJ friend insane. Haha.
22	Most extroverted introvert ?	
2	IxFJ gets energy from other people's excitement. Therefore they also get energy from intellectual interactions, exploring possibilities, or doing things, with the relevant other introverted types.\n\nIMO, YMMV, etc.\n
2	My best friend seriously thought I was an extrovert by the fact I can talk her to death on Skype chat. But...most of my efforts are focused towards a few people, and even though I love to withdraw at the end of the day to be by myself. So...social while I'm with the ones I love, but happy to be alone too. Strangers...it really depends. Sometimes I'm quiet and other times I'll talk to someone in the checkout line. 
2	How do you get along with entps	If infjs worship us . . . what happens when you take and infj and make them a sensor? Do they continue to worship entps or hate them because they are the complete opposite of entps. 
5	I had a best friend who was an ENTP and I ended up falling in love with him. We both horrifically screwed it up though before we could even give the relationship a chance. He's getting married today and I still regret everything with every fiber of my being and wish I could still talk to him. 
3	I don't think I know any irl, but honestly every time I see you guys online, you piss me off. I tend to avoid interacting with you because I know there's a very good chance it's just going to spike my blood pressure something fierce. I have a particular problem with pretension though, so I might not be representative of most ISFJs. 
3	I'm an ISFJ and my SO is an ENTP. We have been together for 7 years and have a lot in common, also we have different traits that admire in each other. We help each other to be a more complete person. For example, he is now more empathetic than some years ago, and I have learnt to not overthink too much and identify when I'm being crazy. Normally, our arguments get complicated when I feel bad or anxious and he can't understand how I feel, he always is giving me solutions to my problems but little comfort. Sometimes I want someone that understands how I feel, not telling me what I'm doing wrong and what I should do instead. Also I'm very caring and like to surprise him with little actions, he on the other hand shows his love in a more practical way haha. 
1	Depends on people. If you have enough tact, you'll be fine.\n\nSource : I don't have enough tact.\n\nPS : INFJs who worship us don't know us. ISFJs are usually more clearsighted and pragmatic, at this regard.
2	ENTPs are the most attractive of all people (not to me but in general), even when they treat people badly they still find them around, could be a natural charisma or whatever you want to call it. SFs are more prone to see through it.  All STs  on the other hand are not impressed to begin with. Specially ISTJs don't think highly of you people.
2	i usually find them to be, yeah interesting and intelligent, but too detached and like to play devil's advocate without really listening to what i'm trying to say.  i do have a good ENTP friend who i have the same interests in though and we get on well enough, wouldn't be an ideal relationship though.
2	I am an ENTP and I just told my friend to do this test. Apparently he is one of you guys, an ISFJ.\n\nThe funny thing is that we have a lot of things in common when it comes to interests. We both like to play games (are good in those games too), have the same career (web development), around the same humor and we both like watching Animes :'d\n\nOur friendship is good I think. Not that close (we don't really talk about personal stuff) but I can talk with him about many things. Unfortunately I am a bad listener sometimes because I always get distracted and lost in my thoughts and then I'm like "What did you just say?" :P but luckily he always responds easily and friendly in a fun way. No hard feelings. I do get along really well with him. I never really thought about this kind of stuff, so I can't go into much details but I will take care of our social interactions :D!\n\nAlso in term of relationships ENTP and ISFJ have a potential to get along according to\nhttp://www.personalityrelationships.net/entp-relationships/
1	I'm an ISFJ, and my fiancé is INTJ and my best friend is ENTP. I've gotta say, I love my NTs and it bothers me how much material online says we should clash. But what REALLY makes me laugh is how supposedly I should be comparable with ESTP, my least favorite segment of humanity 🙄
1	I almost dated an ENTP, and I know a handful of xNTPs personally. They're definitely interesting. ENTP in question and I would've never really gotten along romantically, however, despite that never happening, I still go to him for advice. He always gives me rational, reasonable solutions when I'm not handling things well and allows me to see things from completely new perspectives, especially being a traditionalist. \n\n\nAs for my other xNTP friends, I love the constant flow of ideas from my INTP friend and I love bouncing those ideas off of her. My *other* INTP friend never fails to make me smile. Yeah, I'm really different from them, but I don't know if I could ever get bored of them. 
1	My dad is an ENTP and I used to love & respect him & get along very well with him. But he kind of went off the rails after his midlife crisis recently and our relationship has been rocky ever since. Now I can barely stand to be around him! His behavior in public... weird need to have to charm everyone he comes across, especially new people, really irks me for whatever reason. IDK if it's just me but maybe once you get on an ISFJ's bad side it's hard to get out haha I don't give him a break at all, even when it's clear he's trying to appease me.\n\nWe used to get along b/c our senses of humor, and him making me feel protected and like I had someone to hide behind in social situations, or an example to follow. Now all I can do is notice how different we are and how much I dislike his personality lol! Even though other people think he's the nicest guy alive! I go to the dentist, and they find out I'm his kid and get all excited telling me how great he is, even though he's only been to this dentist twice.
15	I made 10 sticky note affirmations about myself to keep my self confidence up especially when Im beating myself up for little things. I recommend you guys do the same!	
2	A lot of your stickies apply to me as well. I suppose that's why we are both in this sub lol
1	I have no faith in this idea. That's a good reason to keep going : I talk from a mix of blind hatred (of the idea only !) and cynicism.
4	A short video summary of the ISFJ personality type	Hey Guys, I am an ENTP and I am creating short video summaries for each type as a side-project. I just finished the ISFJ video and thought I'd let you know :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LklfhiFNzms\n\nThank you guys for being so warm and friendly individuals that you guys hold the pillars of the world together :)\n\nI really love reading feedbacks so let me know what you think! Enjoy! :)
1	German accent ?\n\nI shouldn't post as I'm not really concerned … Well, I'm that kind of asshole I guess.
3	ISFJ emotional wall?	Hello everybody :-) so I have a question here! My little brother is an ISFJ, and he's been having some problems in his life lately, but he just *won't* talk to me even if I might be able to help him out with them.\nI found out secondhand from a few of our friends today that he's been seeking advice from them, and after chatting to a few more of the friends that we share, it turns out that he's been asking all of them for advice except for me, and it's over some pretty personal matters.\n\nI am kind of hurt by this, as we have always been best friends as children, and I always tell him about everything that's going on in my life but it feels like he has this humongous emotional wall up for me and exclusively me.\n\nThe biggest problem I learned that he's facing is his marriage is falling apart, but he's never so much as mentioned it to me even when I ask. According to our shared friends, he's been talking to them about it for months as well as some other big things happening in his life. I am quite upset about this because I always thought we were real close, but this kind of thing is happening more frequently lately where I will find out he's been having a problem in his life but he never brings it up to me, and I find out by accident or through other people. \n\nIs there any way to break down said emotional wall and get him to trust me? I don't think going up and simply asking how his marriage is going will give me much, and I want to get him to trust me enough to talk to me more. What's the cause of your emotional walls and boundaries, ISFJs? How do people break them down?\nYou would think since we are family and grew up really close to each other, and even more so that I tell him everything that we'd be the best of friends but it seems he's been keeping more from me than I ever knew, and I'm worried about his emotional health during this time. How should I go about this issue of trust without building that wall up more and more?
5	My immediate thought is that it could be a shame thing, honestly. For me, sometimes when I'm very close to someone I have a really hard time admitting things to them that I'm embarrassed about or that I think might cause them to feel disappointed in me. I'll talk to other, less close friends about it instead because there's less pressure when I'm not as concerned about how those people feel about me or living up to some standard I've projected onto a person I'm close to. \n\nIt's also possible that if you're having a tough time too, he doesn't want to add to your burden. We tend to be very overly-aware of that sort of thing and worry too much about not putting any sort of strain on other people, I think. \n\nAs for building up trust, it's kind of hard to say? If you're as close as you think you are, I'm not sure how much more trust you could build. Maybe just try to talk to him about it directly? If you approach it from an angle of "I've heard x from some of your friends, and if you don't want to talk to me about it that's fine, but if there's a reason you feel you can't tell me can we talk about it?" then I think it would be pretty hard to take the wrong way, and at least that would open up some communication. 
3	I can see that. I am "close" with my sister but personal stuff like that is an absolute no. Too close. Way too close. I need objective input. No risk of damage to a relationship if I don't like what you have to say. And say the wrong thing....it will not be forgotten.
1	I could think of a few potential reasons:\n\n* Since you talk about the problems you have in life to him he doesnt want you to ALSO worry about him. Its a weird selfless selfish act since he doesnt want his family to worry about him because he cares about them but it just causes problems like this.\n\n* Do you have a critical way of telling people how to do things if they ask for advice or something? There is the possibility he could see you being harsh with him about bringing up the issues and he doesnt want to start conflict with his family when he already has conflict with his own marraige. Maybe he thinks youre likely to directly intervene instead of just giving advice?\n\nJust some thoughts as someone who doesnt know the whole situation but has been in situations where I go to other people over my family 
1	I wouldn't be offended by it - he probably just doesn't want to throw his problems on top of yours because he cares about you! And doesn't want to cause drama by dragging you into his issues. I have this weird pride/shame thing where I hate asking for help, especially from people I respect/love.\n\nWhenever I have issues, I'm more likely to post anonymously on reddit or something and gush about my entire life story and deepest inner thoughts to complete strangers! I don't want to have to worry about people I care about judging me on top of all that.\n\nAdvice for getting him to open up....\n\nBest way to get me to open up about a really deep personal issue is to come to me for advice with the same issue. Or talk about that same issue in conversation with me. Or hypothetical like say you have a friend going through x. And I'll say oh my god I've gone through x too, you should tell them to y and z.\n\nOther example was my friend and I were out to dinner and she was telling me about her relationship and I opened up to her about why I am not in one. Also she talked about her depression and I told her I was going through the same thing and if she ever wanted to talk I was there etc.\n\nYou could just ask him how he's doing generally maybe?\n\nOr just help him out by doing some small task you know he needs help with, doesn't have to be related to the whole marriage issue. It's cool to have people taking care of us every now and then, especially if we don't have to ask them to. :)\n\nEdit: another way I open up about stuff is if it's through humor. Because joking about it gives me an "out" where I can say I wasn't being serious. Might be different for him though, I'm just a really screwed up individual with a dark sense of humor!

9	Wheee I love this. My post is up there, yay. ISFJs are practical and rational as fuck. Love you guys.
4	To expand upon one overlooked area where ISFJs can be quite capable, but isn't exactly the core strength of the type:\n\nOne big thing that's often missed is that ISFJs, just like INTPs, can be system-building logicians. It's the Si-Ti thing to build systems of deductions and definitions. I'd wager a good handful of people who have been typed at INTP are actually ISFJs.\n\nThe key difference, as far as I can tell, is how that Si-Ti style is expressed. INTPs have high Ne, and Ti-Ne overall is expert at if-then deduction and does it fast. They see many corollaries as so obvious they're not really worth explaining or think others just get all the implications of their statement (No. We don't). With ISFJs, Ne use isn't so facile, but the Si-Ti desire to crunch things out logically and have everything make sense is strong in some. The end result? A thoroughly reasoned, consistent logical system... with every deduction spelled out in excruciatingly meticulous detail. \n\nA further trait that seems to characterize IxFJ attempts to build logical systems - likely from the capable but somewhat less nuanced nature of the tertiary, but also due to the above need for thoroughness - is a certain fondness of clean divisions and categories: Things are arranged in clean levels, and within a level things are a priori defined so that they're divided cleanly, evenly and the categories by definition encompass all the possibilities. Typology articles a great case in point, where many Ti writers' conceptions go along lines like "objective attitude to abstraction, subjective attitude to abstraction, objective attitude to the concrete, subjective attitude to the concrete", clean, even, sensible. *Too clean*. A fondness of these kinds of divisions is typical of alpha quadra logicians in general, but together with explaining out every branch of their tree, define the ISFJ style of structured reason.
3	If anyone has any topics or content or questions they think would be fitting for this FAQ, please feel free to post them in this topic.
3	This is great! \n\nThings like this are why I always look confusedly at my ISFJ friends when they tell me how disorganized they are :)
3	Hey, glad to see someone's taking charge of this subreddit. If you want another moderator ever, hit me up. \n\n/u/superange128
1	TOO MUCH LINKS OMGGGG
1	ISFJs are awesome! I wish I had an ISFJ best friend.
3	Do you keep a To-Do list?	I've never kept a todo list. I usually keep in mind the things I have to do through the day, although sometimes I get a bit anxious of forgetting about important things if I have to do any and so I start thinking about those all the time to make sure I don't forget.\n\nI often think that having one would help me a lot, for example, apart from the everyday list, I could schedule those things I always say that I want to do but never actually get myself to do because I end up doing the same things every time out of laziness or because I don't want to escape my comfort zone.\n\nWriting down something like a mind map would help me figure out what I want to do by indicating step by step how and when to do what.\n\nI'd like to know, do you keep a To-Do list? If you do, what is it like? Also do you write it down on a paper/notepad or do you use something like a computer/smartphone program?
3	I have... way too many.\n\n* One for Games I want to play\n* One for anime I want to watch\n* One for Tasks I need to do ASAP\n* Scheduled weekly/daily Tasks that send me reminders so I dont forget\n\nthen a lot of stuff in my head
3	I don't often write them out. But when I do and I can check them off, it is oh so satisfying.
1	Oh yes! I make to-do lists for even the smallest things.\n\nI keep a physical [planner](https://www.amazon.com/Moleskine-Weekly-Notebook-Large-Black/dp/B015NG44I4/ref=pd_sim_14_2?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B015NG44I4&pd_rd_r=H0YVV0RZ6G5T65GAYKY5&pd_rd_w=9E8XN&pd_rd_wg=lUjQm&psc=1&refRID=H0YVV0RZ6G5T65GAYKY5) since I'm in school full time and work part time (although it creeps up to full time every once in a while) and need to keep everything organized. I like the one I linked to because on one side I can see my week laid out and on the other I can literally make one huge to-do list for the week.\n\nI like making to-do lists because they help me plan out what I'm going to do and keep me from feeling lost. It also eases my anxiety about forgetting/missing something because everything's in one place that I can reference back to at any time. I like having a physical record so if I get behind I can see all the stuff I haven't crossed off and it's kinda like a kick in the butt to get going.\n\nThere's also something to be said about the satisfaction of crossing everything out and *knowing* that you can relax on your day(s) off.
1	Well, I have ADHD (the inattentive type, which used to be called ADD), so my use of to-do lists is definitely on and off. I try to make them when I can remember to, but the thought often just doesn't occur, or I make one and then stop remembering to check it halfway through.\n\nBut when I do use them I'll literally just put anything I need to do on them. Need to do my taxes? On the to-do list. Update my resume? On the to-do list. Need to brush my teeth? On the to-do list. Shower? On the to-do list. Having ADHD means I really have a hard time trusting myself to remember to do anything, so even tasks that are habit for most people will end up on my lists. \n\nI rarely ever get to cross every item off, but having them in writing at least helps keep me on task and will keep an item in my memory for a bit longer than if I let it just bounce around my brain, in which case it would last about 3 seconds :P Also, I usually write them down on paper, because having a physical object is easier for me to remember than having to check an app or something. 
1	I usually don't write them out... I have a lot of thoughts in my head about things that need to get done though.\n\nI had to train myself to start making lists & keeping track of everything. I try to put all important events in google calendar and general to-do things on a white board by my front door.
1	I used to never keep to-do lists, but then I had a kid. I became so stressed when trying to remember all the things that I needed to do or remember, and being sleep deprived and pre-occupied with an infant made it impossible to remember. Now I have lists upon lists, haha! I have my Wunderlist categorized and sub-categorized with short-term goals, long-term goals, grocery lists, and things to watch, read, buy, or remember. I have a physical planner for my daily tasks (whose laundry to run, what's for dinner each night, appointments, errands, etc.). Then I also have a whiteboard on the fridge with food items I need to buy either at Costco or the grocery store, and I update that as we run out of things in the kitchen.\n\nEssentially, my lists are my life, and without them I'd fall apart. :D
1	i write down a list but i never need to look back at it - i just remember what it is. i just write it down to get it out my brain and focus on something else :D. my lists tend to just be what i want done, never in the order i want them done, so it's just an orderly mess :D but like i say, i never actually look back at it.
1	I only do it if I have a lot to keep up with, say a lot of errands to do. I'll make a list and order it by location of the stop to make it as efficient as possible. I prefer pen and paper, but I've used the memo on my phone in a pinch.
1	I do. Helps me stay sane and focus on things. I hate doing nothing. Even now, I would rather be in an office doing some work. Not doing nothing.
12	Looks like I'm the new moderator of this subreddit, anyone have anything they want added/changed removed?	Some things I was thinking of adding\n\n* Maybe a sticky topic of sites that can help figure out if you're really an ISFJ or stuff to understnad ISFJs better?\n* User Flairs, maybe just of the different types so we know who's an ISFJ and what type is visiting.\n* Update the "Want to chat?" section. Maybe more users want to be added to that? I noticed a few users on there are either inactive or have their account deleted.\n* Maybe more mods if people wanto be one?\n* Maybe do something with automod like a weekly discusion topic or something?\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions, feel free to post in this topic.
6	I think some sort of FAQ/read before posting type of sticky would be nice. I get pretty tired of the "why are you guys all so boring/conservative/afraid of change/etc" posts.
5	I think a weekly discussion topic would be nice! Maybe something behavior or personal growth related. 
-1	ENxP, here. I can flair. I want to mod.\n\nEDIT : Flairs are already here. My bad. I'll still have to state my type every time, I think.\n\nI can furnish reasons, motivations and arguments why I'd be a good mod here. I just feel it's pointless to justify myself again and again. Especially when I'm somewhat condemned just because I proposed the idea.\n\nNothing can change if you don't trust those who know change well and/or act so nothing changes. I'm here to help an make things smooth. I'm here to learn to be a better human being by taking responsibilities. I don't know how it can be seen as wrong.
5	I can't let go of things, it totally seems to be in my nature - how to cope?	I'm so tired of worrying about and not being able to let go of things not under my control. There are things that I've said and mistakes that I've made that I can't take back, and even though I've learned from them and should be able to move on since I can't do anything more about it, my mind keeps circulating back towards it. Similarly, there's something I've lost, and I just want to forget that it ever happened, I don't want this to stick in my mind either. I want to be able to move on from what happens. \n\n\nDoes this happen to anyone else? How do I cope with it? 
3	ISFJ also. Yes, this definitely happens. One thing I have found is that often the best way through a shitty situation is directly through it. It's not easy to accept your mistakes and actually get over them, but I've found that if you just distract yourself they build up. You'll start to reject specific things that may relate to whatever it is that you're trying to get over (eg. If it's a relationship and you had a special song, you may now start to reject that song/band and try to shut it out of your life). \n\nIt's not easy, and there will be many moments of feeling alone and full of regret, but accepting these things and being mindful can help you not make the same mistakes in the future. You're not a slave to your past, and you can still control your future, so don't let that escape your grasp as well. 
1	ENxP here.\n\nYou go towards what you look at. Just focus on your future projects. Distract yourself.\n\nI know that well, as not only sensors have to deal with mental inertia. In fact, my mind is made of those loops.\n\nHow to break free ? You'll have to imagine and build that life where you're free from that. And build it stone by stone, brick by brick.\n\nI won't lie, I gave up, like most. I chose just to build my life so I'm happy with it, than getting rid of something that so essential to my thinking.\n\nIs it somehow a useful advice to you ?
16	Some people say ISFJs tend to be the (one of the) most outgoing/extroverted introvert types. Do you agree with that?	I figure a reason people say that it Fe is high up on our stack so importance on external values/people/appearances would matter more to where we would be more willing to want to interact with others.\n\nWhile Im a generally quiet person, I genuinely enjoy talking to people often and I do like being in communities. Ill just get to the usual introvert point of wanting to keep  to myself or stick to online stuff.
13	From my own personal experience, I'd agree with that. Though I'm quite introverted, I genuinely love talking to people and interacting.
12	When I compare myself to other introverts, I'd say yes, that's true.\n\nI can be extremely bubbly, friendly and warm with strangers, moreso than my other introvert friends/family members. I can come across as quite extroverted, and I'm a pretty social person. I enjoy social occasions. \n\nI get drained pretty fast, which is when I tend to come across as quiet and shy, and I'm not as good with big groups of people, but for the most part, I would agree with this.
6	I'm sure as hell not lol. My daily quota for people time is incredibly low, honestly.... I do my best to be friendly even though I lean quiet/awkward, and I always try to be helpful and do what I can for people, but I'm not remotely extroverted. Even talking to people I genuinely adore makes me ridiculously tired. 
3	I'd agree with that. When I'm PUT in a social situation, I do quite well and and am usually in no hurry to end it but I have zero motivation to seek out a social situation. \nHowever, I'm a sucker for situations that require my help or support. If I have a job to do, I'm ON it. 
2	ENxP, here.\n\nThat would be coherent with ENTPs being the most introverted of extroverts.\n\nAmusing mirror pattern.
1	Agree. That's why sometimes I test as an ESFJ
1	Yeah! I think mostly it's my desire to help others and be of service to others that causes this. I have noticed that it's easier when the other person is an extrovert; I'm really not the best at bringing social energy out of introverts. But I really do like the company of others.
1	I like talking to people and love to spend time with friends, but I also need time alone every day or so. And I basically never start the conversation if I don't know you very well. I'm happy to talk; I just don't know if you want to talk to me so you have to start taking first. 
1	There's a misunderstanding about telling ISFJs are the most outgoing introverts, depicting us sometimes as ambiverts.\nAs far as I've observed (myself plus a bunch of other ISFJs than my own self), and documented through the Internet, we're just committed to be kind and empathetic most of time, which can turn some persons into thinking we're outgoing. We're just opened to them for a while, and when we reach our social quota, we're tired and need to be on our own...\nWe love talking and interacting because, out of recharging while being on our own, we're energized by emotional interaction (Fe).\nThat does not necessarily make most of us really outgoing.\nI would recommend you to carry on your researches on MBTI cognitive functions to provide you a better view about all that.\nKind regards, \n\nPY
1	And, as I've previously posted on a similar thread: \nI found a few months ago an interesting picture on the Internet about extroverted introverts, telling that:\nIxFJ are extroverted with emotional interactions\nIxTJ are extroverted with intellectual interactions\nINxP are extroverted with exploring possibilities\nISxP are extroverted with doing.\nI've experienced that (as an ISFJ, and with such other types).\nAnd it really makes sense with MBTI in general, understanding the cognitive functions. Do I feel.\nDepends on what we're talking about, as says the picture :-)
1	Yes, actually. I've brought it up on here before, but it seems I actually *am* an introvert, but I can come off as an extrovert if I really need to. Not that I like acting all bubbly, but when it's necessary I can pull it off. 
10	Coping strategies when you are beating yourself up	What's your strategy in getting yourself out of the slump when you KNOW you're being too hard on yourself?\n\nMine is making sure I distract myself and telling myself that it's all in my head and that what I'm thinking is probably not true.\n\n**Example:** when I make a mistake which causes someone I care about to get upset, I tend to dwell on it and mope around a bit. But I try to snap out of it by being productive, going to the gym and basically, tell myself that I'm over thinking it (which works like 30% of the time but that's still something).\n\nPlease share your stories and tips!\n\nLove,\nAnother ISFJ
3	I practice learning and changing. So i'd think "you handled things this way. now you see a better way of doing it. do that next time. you are a different person now. don't feel bad, old you did it wrong, new you will get it right"\n\nand it was hard as heck to do that in order to not wallow in regret while still seeking self improvement. it took a few years but i've turned it into a reflex. mistake! -> don't feel bad-> analyze -> learn -> change -> celebrate.\n\ngym helped a lot because of having to learn how to get my form down for lifting and slowly getting it better and better. also Meet the Robinsons was a big help.
3	Sometimes the only way I can pull myself out of that is with some help from others.\n\nI have 3-4 people in my life who really care about me, and really have my back. Obviously I try to redirect my thinking patterns on my own first, and if I can, I try to distract myself with other stuff in hopes that it'll pass.\n\nBut during those times when I'm really down on myself, feel like I'm not worth anything, etc, I usually try to talk to someone I love, and it is reassuring to have them tell me that I'm not a waste of flesh, basically.
2	I don't have any tricks that work for me yet, but wanted to say that this thread is extremely helpful to read through. I get in my head way too much and the whole beating myself up thing is really exhausting, so I will be trying out the tips mentioned by other users.
2	I'm very guilty of beating myself up and I've never learned to forgive myself. I'm currently stressing out about something. Wish me luck. 
1	I don't know if anyone else does Daily Mood Logs but that's what I do and they're a lifesaver.
2	Unsure of whether I'm actually extroverted or introverted	Okay, so I first took the MBTI test when I was younger and I typed as an ESFJ. I was hyper and bubbly and loved people, yada yada. Then I went through a kind of depression and came out of it as an I. Now I'm unsure if I'm actually E or I, because-\n\n\n1) Can you really change types so easily? \n2) Or is this just having matured more?\n3) I do enjoy being around some people; others exhaust me, and even if I've had a lot of fun, I *do* need some time to recharge. However, at the same time, I am extremely dependent on and *need* people. \n4) Isn't ISFJ considered the most 'extroverted' (I guess outgoing would be a better term) of the introverted types?\n5) I agree more with ISFJ when I read up on it. \n6) My SO tells me he thinks I'm an 'extroverted riddled by anxiety'. And I'd slightly agree with that because I've been overcoming my anxiety a bit more and noticed that I am slightly more positive and outgoing.\n\n\nA lot of these could type me as ambiverted; in fact, I am probably more ambiverted than anything. But does anyone have any thoughts/things to add on whether I am actually more introverted? 
3	Well, mbti doesn't really account for mental illness, which is definitely a weakness of the whole theory, frankly. So it's hard to say if a person's type can change due to depression/anxiety, or if you can truly type someone who suffers from a mood or personality disorder. But, the best way to figure out your type will always be through the cognitive functions and your function stack. \n\nIt may be easier for you to identify your inferior function? If you're an ESFJ it would be Introverted Thinking (Ti), whereas if you're an ISFJ it would be Extroverted Intuiting (Ne). [This post](http://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/119442161307/accurate-typing-the-inferior-function) might be useful in figuring it out (and I like that blog's info a lot anyway, although it can be a lot of heavy reading). Depending on your self-knowledge and experiences, identifying your dominant function may be easier, though, so I'll link you to [this post](http://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/119355115987/accurate-typing-the-dominant-function) as well. If you don't know anything about cognitive functions, that second post may actually be the better place to start, as it provides some brief intro to the concept. \n\nLet me know if any of this is too confusing, I can try to break it down a bit! 
2	I'm definitely borderline between I and E, but ultimately I'm a solid ISFJ because I need time to recharge and I don't really feel the burning need to be around people like I do when I tired of them and want to be alone. However, I am very social and try to keep my social schedule full mainly due to FOMO - fear of missing out. I'd give up my much needed alone time in order to not feel left out. I love people and always seem to be mistaken as an extrovert (always in small groups though... hm...), almost more now that I've gone through the whole college depression^TM thing.\n\nI think ISFJs tend to be the most extroverted introverts because we're more likely to sacrifice *our* recharge time because (1) it makes us feel good/plays towards our empathy (it might be the "correct" way to be in a situation/society; or all the extroverted emotions (Fe) are riling us up, making us extra outgoing; or we want to help people c: ) or (2) it's a step to build/establish relationships/solutions (we're good at putting in the time/effort/patience for long-haul projects without getting as discouraged as others). Like I know I'll overextend myself with new friends and it's not until I've reached a certain level of comfortableness with the relationship am I okay with telling them "thanks for the offer/I'm sorry I can't to x y and x, I'm just going to have a me-day and not do anything and just recharge from the week."\n\nSo, yeah. Ultimately I think the answer is: you're probably an extremely social ISFJ who likes people (but gets tired of them eventually) and have the social grace/knowledge to pass as an extrovert (something valued in society).
3	How do i approach her?	So, i need your help, ISFJs. Im a male INTJ and i like an ISFJ girl. We are friends an all, but i dont know how to properly deal with her. All the times we hang out, its because she asked me out. Also, after 1 hour or so she gets this brutal urge to get more people to hang out with us, leaving me like "why? werent we on a date?" So, any advice on how to ask her out? Do you think she likes me? do i even have a chance?\n\nanother question, are any of you in an ISFJ-INTJ relationship? how is it like?
3	My SO is an isfj, and depending on the day I'm an intp or INTJ. \n\nISFJs can be very committed and loving in relationships which is awesome. For me it's hard at times as I don't explain myself fully my thought process on decisions, but I think that's more of an issue with my personality type. \n\nWe where not friends before dating. She was that really hot girl in my class so I asked her out for an evening, had a great time, then continued asking her our weekly. \n\nI'd suggest just asking her out and being specific. Let her know it's a date and not just the two of you hanging out as friends. It sounds scary, but if she likes you she'll appreciate it. 
2	Hey look, another INTJ in love with an ISFJ.\n\n> All the times we hang out, its because she asked me out.\n\nTry asking her out sometime. See how she reacts. You do want to let her know it's a date though, usually an ISFJ will accept since they like hanging out with people in general. \n\n> Also, after 1 hour or so she gets this brutal urge to get more people to hang out with us, leaving me like "why? werent we on a date?"\n\nMy girlfriend is like that too. She's shy around me but has no problem talking to her friends. It's probably just the ISFJ thing about not being very exclusive.
1	what makes you think she's ISFJ?
1	I'm an INTJ currently seeing an ISFJ and what he has said he really appreciates about me is that I'm completely transparent. So, yes, ask her out, and make it clear what you're doing.\n\nAs a female who has been pursued by many male friends, I want you to prepare yourself for the possibility that she is not interested in you like that, and that is why she adds more people to the hang outs. That was my go-to safe zone net for when a friend who I knew liked me wanted to do something. I would add more people to it.
14	I can't seem to find like-minded people?	I don't really know how to explain this but whenever I go to places or school, I rarely actually meet someone who's into things I like or simply people with a similiar personality I can relate to. This is pretty much the main reason why I've got to know my best friends online.\n\nWhat do you fellows ISFJs like to do or where do you like to go?
3	i do things i like doing and happen to meet people there. when i talk to them i talk in a way that is natural to me and act in the same way. and if people click with how i talk and act then i hang out with them a little more than others. and eventually that can turn into a friendship. if the friendship keeps growing into a close friendship, then i make sure to upkeep it by hanging out every once in a while or calling them on the phone every few weeks or months. \n\nit's how i've met all my friends.
1	I'm not sure what other do, but I seek out clubs and groups to meet people. I met most of my friends in a fiction writing workshop, eastern music group, and a game playing group. I met one other isfj at that game group, so that's two! The rest were filled with mostly n and t types. But I feel so much kinship with infps so it's not a problem. 
1	I search for groups/clubs that cater to my interests. As a huge baseball/soccer fan, I've joined meetups to watch my favorite teams play. Its easier for me to open up with a group of people that I know beforehand have the same interest as I do.
1	One of my really good friends who I'm on the same frequency is I think an INTP if that means anything
5	ENFP here who really likes an ISFJ, would love some advice on how to get closer!	Hey you :)\n\nI'm a male ENFP, met this reaaaal cute looking ISFJ at a dance showcase. Walked up to her and straight up told her how she was the cutest looking at the whole event and how I'd love to add her on facebook (I noticed she got real shy and red, so I wanted to take it slow and not ask for her number yet).\n\nThing is, I would really love to get to know her better, (and admittedly get her to like me) and I would love your advice on this :)\n\nI chat her up often and we always have long conversations, not really about deep stuff but just exchanging interests etc. and she seems like she kinda enjoys chatting.\n\nMy worry: I'm always the person to initiate. Is this an ISFJ thing or is this simply a sign she doesn't like me?\n\nWe met a 2nd time at a New Year's Event (1-2 weeks later) where she was dancing with her group. Instead of sitting with her dance members, she sat down next to me. I really fucked up hardcore and only cringed a few awkward conversations in there (REAL BAD. She felt awkward af tol and eventually sat somewhere else).\n\nShe DID say sorry afterwards and say she always need some time building trust with people, but I wonder:\n\nIs just being nice and chatting with me out of courtesy or does she actuall enjoy the time chatting with me?\n\nUuuhm that was basically my question. I have a bad urge of wanting to know her better, open her up and making her laugh.\nAm I just wasting my time to someone who's just polite? 
3	In my experience, if I don't like someone, I'll just avoid them. I definitely wouldn't make an effort to sit next to them or chat with them or anything.\n\nAs a general rule, it does take me a long time to trust someone, and I'm not likely to make the first move, even if I like someone a LOT.\n\nDon't be afraid to keep pursuing her, but do be observant of her signals. If she seems uncomfortable around you, or seems like she's trying to end conversations quickly and/or get away from you, maybe back off a little.\n\nI really appreciated that my ESFJ boyfriend made most of the first moves and wasn't afraid to initiate nearly everything when we first started dating. Because if it was left up to me, it probably would've taken me 6 months just to hold his hand, despite the fact that I was crazy about him. I was also quite shy around him in the beginning, and he carried most of the conversation until I started getting more comfortable.
2	She probably is interested, otherwise she's more likely to avoid you like the other comment says. Initiating is important though because she probably won't until she builds that trust like she said.
1	ENxP, here.\n\nWhat did you told her ? Isn't your Fi's main purpose is *precisely* to put order in you Ne mental chaos ?\n\nNe's favorite approach is the yolo strat. \n\nMost easy and reliable topics to know someone quiclky are :\n\n * Occupation (Ask her about her work (As a dancer ?).)\n\n * Family (Most of us have parents. Most of those who do have one love them. That's a rather safe bet.)\n\n * Hobbies (What she does for fun. You know fun pretty well. That shouldn't be too hard to get why and how makes her tick.)\n\n * Dreams (It ranges from the ol' "what did you dreamed to become when you were little" to "I wished I had telekinesis. It would be so awesome !" with "Can you remember what you dream about ?" in the middle. Safe, large range of topics and highly symbolic and meaningful. I love that one but I've been told one should be more cautious about that one than the others. Don't know why yet.)
1	Female ENFP (I hope this is ok to reply here!)\n\nEssentially the genders are switched in my relationship and the one thing that I noticed with my partner is that when they do something out of character (sitting with you vs friends), it's a conscious thought. She decided to sit with you for a conscious reason. She's going out of her comfort zone...for you. \n\nIf she brings up any past conversations or remember an obscure detail, it's a very good sign! \n\nI feel your struggle but let me reassure you that it's completely worth it. :) \n\nEdit: words
1	Hi there, \nI agree with some fellows here: if she's not interested, she would simply avoid you.\nYou'll find plenty of guidance on the Internet, articles about trying to woo/date an introvert, and an ISFJ more specifically.\nWe ISFJs do have trust issues after having been hurt and used several times, it comes on top of simply being introverts. So she's honest telling you she needs some time to build trust, and the fact she told you that is another thing that makes me think she could be opened to you. \nBe observant, don't be too pushy, AND please don't try to woo her for your own pleasure, we ISFJs usually commit hard to relationships and are used to have our heart deeply broken, and it often affects us very much more than many other MBTI types.\n\nHoping that helps ?
1	Looking for new ISFJs to join our server.	
3	why did you do this to me
5	How do you dress?	I was wondering what other ISFJs wear on a daily basis.
12	All black, all the time.
2	When I'm at work (banker) usually a shirt and tie and dress pants. On the weekends pretty casual. Jeans and a t shirt and almost always a hat. 
2	I'm a stay at home mom, so if it isn't yoga or sweat pants and a tshirt, then its jeans and a nice top. Rarely anything fancy and definitely no high heels!
2	Jeans, t-shirts, sweaters, and/or cardigans in some combination depending on the season, all in neutral or dark colors, and the only pattern I wear is stripes. For shoes, either sneakers or my plain black boots. So, pretty boring and utilitarian. I do have a soft spot for thigh highs and fun underwear though lol.
1	at work i wear a polo with khakis. i try to show my geek pride with a comic book polo. outside of work in public i wear jeans with fandom t-shirt (harry potter, comic book, adventure time, etc). at a friend's house or my house i wear the same shirts but with similar themed boxers.\n\ni wear black workout shoes for every occasion except for funerals and weddings. and i wear sandals in the summer.\n\nand when i'm cold i pear a hoodie. most black or dark blue. many also geeky.
1	On a daily basis, I just like to blend in. Jeans, tee shirts and cardigans, or a nice sweater. I usually pair it with casual shoes, like ankle boots or Keds.\n\n\nIf I'm feeling more daring, I'll wear a dress, or something that stands out a little more, but that's pretty rare.
1	Our office dress code is "casual." You'll usually find me in jeans, solid knit top, cardigan, and running sandals with some sort of small charm necklace.
1	Loose-ish clothes:\n\nUsually a t-shirt and cargo pants
1	I've got a lot of colorful clothing. However for work it's mostly a black/basic color hoodie with jeans and skate shoes, sometimes a dress shirt or a pullover. In my free time I can also be seen wearing snapbacks. I guess my clothing very much depends on if I am at work or not.\n
1	I tend to keep all my clothes as long as there are not irreversible stains/damage. I still wear things from grade school, I'm small. I find clothes I really like then never let them go. I prefer dark clothes. I'm a big fan of thigh highs, knee highs with a skirt or shorts when it's nice out. I wear jeans when it's cold. Also super into sweaters. Anything comfortable is good.
1	All black, almost all the time; on some week-ends and/or meeting friends, jeans & wool sweater/shirt/T-shirt
0	Identity leeching	Without fail all the ISFJ's I've been around eventually do this creepy thing where they start adopting my idiosyncracies, tastes, style etc. my housemate even buys the same food I buy. This is off putting to say the least.\n\nIs this an intentional thing? If so, what do you expect to be achieved by doing this?
6	Perhaps this is more of an enneagram 9 thing because I can't relate. 
5	I can't say that this is something I consciously do, if I do it at all, and it's never been brought to my attention. The closest I get is picking up the occasional favorite word or phrase or maybe a speech pattern, but that's something that happens to everybody. If this is truly happening, I'd be inclined to say it's probably a function of Si, picking up things that are familiar and therefore comfortable. Given your post though I'm equally inclined to think you're just sort of self-centered and they're not actually copying you.

2	maybe your tastes are just impeccable?
1	ENxP, here (Flairs ? No ?)\n\nWhat's your type ?
2	Hello ISFJ's! It would be interesting to know your DISC or Enneagram personalities.	Mine are \n\n\n- DISC: SC \n\n\n- Enneagram: 9-1 SO
3	I'm actually a type 4 on the enneagram which I think is pretty rare for an isfj. Kind of makes sense though, they seem extremely different but as someone who's both, they can definitely go together.
2	To be honest I dont know what enneagram I am but would really like to know\n\nI think im 6w5 or 9w1 sp or so\n\nSomeone help pls
2	6w5
2	6w5 Social here
2	6w7
2	2w1 Enneagram 
2	2w1 Enneagram
2	DISC: CS - totally accurate imo
2	6w7 apparently 
2	Just exploring the sub, saw this and thought i'd contribute.\n\n* Wing 1w9 - 14.9\n* Wing 9w1 - 14.2\n* Wing 1w2 - 13.8\n\nAll SP. Instinctual variant test placed me in 1, then 9.\n\nDunno what the DISC is.
1	I've never heard of the DISC one before but I got SC too? And I'm 9w1 for enneagram, although currently a moderately unhealthy 9, so I probably seem more like a 6 lol. Not sure about the instinctual variant, though. 
1	Enneagram: 6w5\nDISC: CS\n
1	I know I would have thought we would be much more similar:)
1	Just took the test and had no idea about it before!\n2w3\nAlso, I started getting all worried when I saw a bunch of 6s lol 
1	I forgot my DISC unfortunately but I'm 4w5

4	Can one change personality types simply because they might be ill and depressed?	I have been an INFJ for years now, every time I take the test it always comes up INFJ.\n\nIn this last month, I have been seriously ill and more depressed because of several different reasons. Two days ago, I took the MBTI test again just to see and it came up as ISFJ.\n\nQuestion: why am I now apparently more introverted sensing than introverted intuiting? My mind is very foggy a lot of times and I find it hard to concentrate most of the time. So, because of this has my personality changed and I can only wrap my mind around concrete facts? I can no longer see the bigger picture because I just have a hard time thinking lately? Does any of that make any sense?\n\nHas anyone else had a change in their results of the MBTI test resulting from changes in life events that have happened to them?\n\nThank you in advance for any thoughts.
6	Well, MBTI tests are notoriously unreliable. I flipped between INFJ and ISFJ every time I took the test, and it took actually reading up on the cognitive functions to realize I'm definitely ISFJ. So, if you really are an INFJ, it's possible that if you've been depressed and ill, you've been relying more heavily on your inferior function, and thus answered in ways that caused the test to interpret you as a sensor rather than an intuitive. 
2	Depression is out of Jungian Typology's scope.\n\nIt means you are untypable either fom MBTI's and Socionic's point of view.
2	I went through a 'depression' where I went from ESFJ to being ISFJ. I don't know if it was a part of me growing up and maturing, or if it was my 'depression', or...my S.O. thinks I'm an "extrovert riddled with anxiety" instead of an introvert. It's a little complicated.\n\n\nIf it helps any, I depend on people a *lot* and I don't know if that cancels out some of my introversion.
2	Always an INFJ. Took the test after a breakup when I was depressed and resulted with ISFJ as well. IM BACK TK MY INFJ self again now though
2	Hi there, \nI think there's a misunderstanding here.\nYour MBTI type does not change through your life, and is independent of your answers' variability to MBTI test. This could be surprising, but it is true.\nThere's a post by Heidi Priebe on ThoughtCatalog.com that explains that crystal clear.\nYou can also find nice information about "tertiary loop" and "inferior grip" that can also improve your understanding of why your type does not change despite your answers to the test could make you believe it does.\nA bit more research on the Internet about the rise & expression of cognitive functions trough age may also help you understand what I mean here.\nI can provide you links to useful articles if you want.\nHoping this answer could be of some help,\nKind regards, \n\nPY
4	INFJ with ISFJ mother	My mom is an ISFJ I've tried to learn how to appreciate and love her very much but there are some draw backs.. I am an INFJ and her and I are WORLDS apart. I like philosophy, reading, logically analyzing EVERYTHING to the best of my ability, psychology, and I ABSOLUTELY eat up knowledge. She's slowly realizing that I'm okay and good as I am. I definitely don't feel like the daughter she wanted.\n\nI spend most of my time in my head and I will peak out at the world every now and then but everytime I do with her it's difficult. Being around her takes EXTREME amounts of work and effort. I love discussing things but she doesn't find the things I do interesting. She's not logical on ANY level but she always thinks she knows what she's talking about. She's very emotional and has our best interests at heart but it's so HARD to interact with her. She turns herself in circles with any sort of reasoning and I don't know where to begin. \n\nShe doesn't know how to adapt a little to me and doesn't understand that she isn't adapting. She is just soaking up my energy. I always have to mirror her behavior to be around her. I don't want to always do that. Can't I be myself?\n\nHELP!
3	me and my mother are both ISFJ and i have the same problem with her. the best way i have to deal with it is to stop expecting certain things from her. \n\n1) understand that she isn't logical and that expecting her to be logical when she isn't doesn't make sense. \n\n2) understand that it's ok that i (as her offspring) am more logical and reasonable than she is and that's ok as well because we were exposed to different life experiences. This was a hard expectation to realize because it was a weird transition from being the kid to being the mature person for me.\n\ni have a friend with a toddler that just recently informed his mother that the dog doesn't have horns. he was so surprised by that fact. and she's understandable of her kid saying adorable but clearly wrong and dumb things. the kid hasn't learned certain things yet. and neither has our mothers. so when she starts saying her stuff, imagine an adorable jabbering toddler.\n\ni also want to say that i'm sorry she doesn't show interest in your interests. that sucks. it's also a problem i have with my mother. i've stop expecting that from her as well. 
2	My mom is an ISFJ too. I definitely recognize your struggle. I've always been her 'mother' instead of the other way around. Even when I was a kid or teenager, she couldn't follow my thoughts and interests. For example: I lent her money, said they should search for help and everything. (Financial problems.) I was just almost more responsible and the 'wisest' one. Saw the outcome of things faster, connecting the dots and stuff like that. \n\nShe loves me, but is also very self centered. I don't see her very often, since that sucks energy so much. I love her too though. It's still my mother and sometimes I can see she really tries. She often calls me when she has trouble, but never really listens to me. \n\nI recommend try to accept that you two are worlds apart. Do something together instead of talking. Play a board game for example. My mom has a total different IQ, maybe that is different between you two too. She is way more superficial and focused how she comes over on the outer world. \n\nFun thing: my friend is an ISFJ too, but I could get along with him right from the start. We have deep conversations also. He can't always follow me through the end, but is always very patient and tries. He was once (first time) typed in the test as INTP. So maybe that is the difference. But since that one time always tested as ISFJ. 
5	Are ISFJs Unhelpable?	I guess my real question, is if I should be posting here, or to relationship advice.\n\nINTP here, and I feel increasingly frustrated by not knowing how to support her when she's frustrated. \n\nThis is the best way I can describe it:\n\nHer: "I'm so thirsty lately. I don't know why I'm so thirsty, but I hate being thirsty."\n\nMe: "yeah, that sounds uncomfortable"\n\nNow, this is where I think I'm making a mistake, but can't help it, because, in my head, I'm thinking, "so go drink some water!" But I know that's the *wrong* answer, and she's reaching out to me for emotional support, ... But if you would just drink the freaking water, we wouldn't be having this conversation, and your mouth wouldn't be dry!!\n\nSo invariably, I can't keep myself from saying, "I know this is frustrating for you. What if I pick up some flavored water you like on the way home?" \n\nThis is where my head explodes and it feels like trying to lead a mule to water. I cannot talk her into an obvious solution! She won't do it won't do it won't do it. It will be something like, "it's not the water. It's just that I'm so thirsty" \n\nheadexplode.jpg\n\nSo, is this an ISFJ thing? If so, what do I do? \n\nHelp me subreddit, you're my only hope.\n\nEdit: for clarity, the "thirsty" example was hyperbole made up for an example\n\nEdit edit: thanks for all the feedback even though I may be in the wrong sub
18	Given your limited context, my instinct says it's a depression thing. Not an ISFJ but I've been in her situation before. She most likely knows what she needs to do herself, but is stuck in this self-defeating cycle.\n\nBest you can do is support her and try to get her to rationalize what she's feeling and what she's going through.
11	when i complain like that, i already know what i'm going to do or not do about it. the plan is set and i just want to complain for a bit before i continue with the plan. hearing someone give me a "poor baby" can be nice. \n\nit's....not the most rational behavior. and though the plan is set, a lot of the times it's not the best plan. like being thirsty and not dealing with it because i'm sticking with my plan.
6	she wants attention, that simple, offering her a drink is probably a good way to reassure her you're around for her
5	Ah you poor INTP's, I've seen a trend of your type always bending over backwards trying to accommodate SJ's when it's rarely the case vice versa. Please, if they cannot understand that your authentic way of being helpful is by suggesting ways to solve their problem then let it be that. Do not compromise your way of being for those not willing/incapable to meet you half way. 
3	Yeah, depression/some other disorder that impacts executive functioning might be closer to the mark than her personality type, although it may be a combination of both. I'm an ISFJ and I always know what the rational solution to my problem is, but I also have ADHD, which can make executing that solution feel a lot more convoluted than it seems on the surface because of my difficulties with memory/executive functioning/etc. \n\nOften though if I'm complaining I really do just want emotional support, because "I'm not fucking stupid, I know how to fix the problem, I just don't want to deal with it/it's not that easy/it still bothers me even if I can fix it/etc." It's more about venting my feelings than coming up with an actionable plan, and people trying to give me solutions I'm already aware of just pisses me off. Also, sometimes I vent more as a social thing? I don't really express much feeling to people I don't care about, so if I'm whining to somebody it means I trust them and want to open myself up a bit. She may be different, though! That's just my personal experience. 
3	INTP here, married to ISFJ. For me the issue is that I want to fix things and go, "hey, drink more water, get a water bottle, or even setup hourly reminders on your phone to remind you to drink more." But what my spouse seems to want is compassion and empathy, which can be a little hard at times. Sometimes my spouse will "hint" at things she wants this way, and we've agreed we won't hint to each other on issues, that if we want something or help from each other, we will ask for it. Spouse agrees this is reasonable for us. \n\nTL:DR: I have no idea what to suggest for your relationship, I'm just saying you aren't alone here. 
3	[deleted]
4	She wants you to say something like "UUGHH! THAT is the WORST.  I hate being THIRSTY... AND there's no reason for it!  WHY?!?! You'll be OKAY though, do you want to stop somewhere? No? Well let me know if you need anything.  By the way I did [totally unrelated questionably "helpful" act] for you.  Want to marathon Harry Potter tonight?"
1	Maybe it's a test or something. To see if you can provide her with "water" or whatever it is she is asking for. Maybe her way of asking for help is merely mentioning the problem, but not outright asking if you'll do x. Maybe like another person here said it's to try to be "babied".\n\nI hate asking for help so sometimes I'll put my feelers out there like that and just mention something. If I get a bad response, I will bottle it up and deal with it on my own.\n\nI have no idea haha. ISFJs can be complicated.\n\nEdit: another thought - although along the lines of my first thought above. It could be a way to see how much you care about her. Because if someone had said to me "I'm thirsty lately" and I cared about them/lived with them I would definitely come home with some water without even asking. \n\nLOL or a statement like that would be my hypochondria and me trying to get reassurance from them. That might be less of an ISFJ thing though.
1	I suspect this is a woman thing, not a ISFJ thing.. Women like emotional support, and men like to fix things. 
3	An ISFJ has me worried about love	Hey there! Hopefully I can get some thoughts on this.\n\nI met this ISFJ online, about a month ago. We're both gay guys (probably doesn't matter). We're close in age. I live in the US and he lives in another country.\n\nI've gotten to know him so well. We chat all day long, and we talk to each other almost once a day. We exchanged pictures and all that a little after we got to know each other. Throughout my time knowing him, I've gotten closer to him than I've gotten to anyone in my life. Even my best friend IRL that I've known for almost 10 years... I feel more comfortable and connected with this person online.\n\nI asked him to take a personality test and he's an ISFJ. From my experience with him, he has a lot of deep feelings about me but I've always been the one that has had to show interest. I've always had to show him how I feel before he shows me how he feels. When I finally brought the conversation up with him, he told me he loved me, and since I have deep feelings for him too, I agreed to date him and eventually meet within a year or so.\n\nMy question is, is it normal for someone with this personality to develop such deep feelings so fast? And why did he say he loves me so soon? Or is it not too soon?
2	I'd say it's pretty normal for ISFJs to develop very strong feelings fairly quickly, but we rarely show that to people unless they express their own feelings first, or we feel very comfortable around them.\n\nI've been dating an ESFJ for just shy of 5 months, and he's had to initiate everything right from the start, pretty much. I was too shy to do anything out of fear of rejection. Even now, when we see each other, I'm still a little hesitant to touch him first, and I'm much more reserved about vocalizing my affection, even though I may be feeling great warmth towards him.\nWe're in a committed relationship and I'm still afraid to hold his hand unless he does it first. ISFJs are typically very private about our emotions, both positive and negative.\n\n\nIn my relationship neither of us have said "I love you" yet, but I definitely could've after the first couple months, it didn't take long for me to feel it. That being said, I don't think I'd say it to someone I've only met online after such a short period of time. At that point, I worry that it may just be projection on his part. \n\n\nI'm not gonna say there's a set timeline for when it's too soon to say "I love you", but realistically, one month of only online interaction isn't really enough to know whether or not you love somebody, because you can hardly know them as a person. I met my boyfriend online, and while he was mostly the same in person, there were a lot more sides to him than I got to see online, and I definitely didn't feel like I really knew him until I got to see multiple sides of him in multiple different scenarios and situations.\n\n\nI would suggest proceeding with caution. I'm not saying that this is the case, but often times an early warning sign of an abusive relationship is moving things too quickly, and the abuser putting their partner up on a pedestal and projecting an unrealistic view onto them. He may very well love you, based on what he's seen of you so far, but most healthy people don't rush into the "L" word so fast like that.
1	As an ISFJ, that sounds a lot like how I would behave. If he said he loved you right after you mentioned that you always have had to show interest first, he was most likely trying to meet your needs and be the one to initiate. That certainly doesn't discredit the affection he has for you, but may have been a factor in his expressing it so soon. While all ISFJs probably differ on this, I typically develop deep feelings quickly. Hopefully this gives you a little bit of insight!
1	I'm an ISFJ as well and I have had personal experiences with developing deep feelings extremely fast. \n\nMy first real, legitimate crush crept up on me out of nowhere and intensified extremely quickly. I'm talking, within the first week of knowing this person. Because it came so quickly, I can see why you are questioning whether his feelings for you are genuine. That being said, I believe that once you meet someone you have an amazing connection with, time is irrelevant. 
1	In relationship with ISFJ. I've found that people of this personality type can be very committed and loving in a relationship. The hard part is that at least in my case, an isfj needs to first hear about commitment and feel devotion before they open up. \n\nTo summarize, I'd say your situation sounds fairly normal. If you treat this guy right, then I imagine he will be extreamly loyal and caring towards you.

9	expressing hurt	So for many years I've learned to distrust reacting on my emotions right away and also became very practiced in how I express myself in order to be understood and make arguments so that they are effective. it's a skill i built up in dealing with my emotionally abusive and narcissistic parents. \n\nIf someone were to say something mean or something that upsets me, I would digest their words to figure out why it was said or what was the real meaning of it. then i'd go over in my head what about it i don't like and then how to talk to the person so that they can understand what i don't like about it, that the thing i don't like makes sense, and why it would be beneficial for them and to those around them if this person were to alter how they act in similar circumstances.\n\nand i can do this through high stress situations. but i don't show it on my face, in my body language, or my tone. i don't want to escalate the situation, and i want to be at maximum persuasion for a long term effect, and the best way i find to do so is through a calm demeanor and through making simple points, and kind of stroking a person's ego a bit on whatever their strongest positive trait is, and basing my argument around that trait and that perspective. and it's kind of stupidly martyristic of me to always be doing this i guess. i'm very ends-over-means and take-the-high-road about it.\n\nbut it comes with a draw back in that it takes a lot of effort for me to do that. it sucks the emotional energy right out of me. and also, when i do it, it requires me to show calm, even when i'm not, even if my heart is racing and i just want to yell at the person. and this ended up being a problem with my ex girlfriend. even if i said i disliked something, it was hard for her to really comprehend how much it was a problem for me because i did not show it in my expressions or tone, only my words.\n\ni don't even know what i'm trying to get out of writing this. advice? understanding? something. i just know there is a problem and it's not quite concrete to me yet what it's exact nature is so i currently can't even try to find a solution.
5	ENTP here to link the dots, and push on the wrong buttons.\n\nLets see : \n\n * Emotional Withdrawal\n\nBecause : \n\n * Parents with narcissistic tendencies.\n\n---\n\nMy 500+ comment Karma on /r/raisedbynarcissists is clear about what to do : \n\n>Run. Run away and never return.\n\nYou need to feel safe, before anything. You need a home, and I'm sure you've come to find your parent's isn't any home.\n\nI'm emotionally drained, too, because I get nothing from no one. It's literally like being out of fucks to give.\n\nSo, safe place, and people who can give you some love and warmth, basically.\n\n
1	ISFJs to join discord server! We definitely need more SJs to balance things out. Request your type!	
2	I really wanted to like your Discord but there's just way too much shitposting for my tastes there.\n\nSorry.
16	Selective friendships	As an ISFJ, I can be really selective about who my close friends are, and sometimes I feel like *only* talking to them and them alone, or *only* hanging out with them and them alone. I also tend to be selective about the friends I make in general, and have a bad habit of burning some bridges. Is anyone else like this?
10	This is absolutely me. I tend to keep nearly everybody at an arm's length, until I've determined that I want them in my inner-circle, and then I spend most of my time talking to/hanging out with them.\n\nEverybody else is considered a distant acquaintance, to me.\nThey don't really know me for who I really am.
7	Yep. That whole introvert thing, I think. I always hope to find people who will really click with me, and when I do I keep them close, but everyone else is just kinda whatever. They're fine, but I'm not gonna bother hanging out with them, since what's the point if I'm only kinda gonna enjoy it? It sounds cold to say it this way, but it's a lot of energy to expend if the benefit is minimal. 
3	yeah, i do that too. though it's become a bit of a problem with me because i feel so strongly about who i want to spend time talking with, i end up being kind of cold to acquaintances. like i won't even talk with them or have a casual conversation with them if they just happen to be in the same room with me. instead im focused on whatever i'm working on or thinking about. and i do this to the point that i'm really rusty at casual conversations. and i need to relearn that skill. so, i'm practicing it all again.
2	I guess that's normal for me at least. The reason is because I tend to care alot more if I have more friends. More friends means more people to know. I may sound evil when I think it's a waste to invest a friendship that may not going to work. That's why I have a small circle of friends. Any opinions on this is gladly appriciated.
2	I'm like this too. I have 5 close friends and 3/5 are like me where we are basically each other's only friends. 2/5 have other friends outside our group and I don't really like hanging with them with their other friends around. At parties we just hang out with each other which some people get annoyed about. One of my friends boyfriends calls us Fort Knox. Not that we do it on purpose, we just don't care to make other friends 
2	I'm either really good friends with people or just an acquaintance. There's not really much in-between the two.

8	I'm 21 and have a memory so good it is holding me back from moving on	I'm 21 and have a memory so good it is holding me back from moving on. I can remember things from when I was three years old. But the memories I have when I was 13 years and up really hold me back. I Have constant "flashbacks" of the past going back to the 7th grade. It's like watching my memories on TV. To be honest, most of these memories are of vacations with family, trips, middle school, high school, and even driving down a random street or eating at a random restaurant with my family. I'm never "alone" in these memories/flashbacks. Some days they don't happen at all and some days they happen every minute. Anyone else have these?
3	This happens to me all of the time  I also have no idea how to cope with it.
2	What do you mean "moving on"? The memories you describe sounds like nice memories, what's restricting about them? 
2	Smoke some pot, it will help .
1	that's interesting. i don't trust my memories. they feel so real to me but then i get the occasional 3rd person memory that still feels as legitimate as the rest.
11	I'm an ISFJ new to reddit... my brain hurts. How do you do this?	My ENTP husband has been trying to give me a tutorial, and there is so much information!  Any tips for a newbie?  Why do you like reddit?  
2	I just like lurking in a lot of the threads. I also contribute to advice threads like on r/relationships or r/depression. Some of the main page stuff makes for good conversation in the real world since it seems like news usually hits reddit before the news on tv.\n\nThen I guess other than that reddit is mostly about cute dog or cat pictures.
3	I started enjoying reddit much more once I unsubscribed to most of the default subreddits and found one that are  specific to my likes and interests. Got any TV shows you really like? Hobbies? Like watching cute animal gifs? You can find a subreddit for just about anything you're into. 
2	I like reddit for the communities, big and small. As for finding what you like from the website, just search for subreddits for things you like/are interested in -- for example, my most visited subs are r/AskReddit, r/television, r/femalefashionadvice, r/TalesFromYourServer (since I used to work in the service industry) and my hometown and college subs. If you find something you like, look on the sidebar, they probably have links to similar content.\n\nGive yourself some time to get used to the website and don't be afraid to unsubscribe to any default subs (I actually recommend this for some of the bigger ones *cough* r/funny *cough*). Eventually you'll get it tailored to your liking :)
1	Don't worry about doing it "correctly". Just take a look around, hang out on the subs you like and that's it. Reddit has its etiquette like all social media, but it's pretty easy to work out if you read the sidebars and lurk for a little while.\n\nI like Reddit because you can learn so many random facts and because of the filthy humour. I'm a big fan of /r/explainlikeimfive, /r/nostupidquestions, /r/showerthoughts and /r/lifeprotips.
1	ENxP here.\n\nI like reddit because there is so much information. I spend most of my time just reading the titles and wondering if the content is worthy of my time or not.\n\nI ironically usually taking more time wondering that reading the whole thing.\n\nI also often end up with my /new/ feed emptied by my frenetic inquisitive curiosity. \n\nTL;DR : Don't be like me. You've probably far better things to do IRL.
1	I unsubscribe from most of the default reddits and look up various ones for entertainment, interests (like Asian Beauty and photography), and go from there. I lurk a lot, upvote a lot, and comment some. I would like to be more active though because it seems like a good way to maybe meet some people.

4	My ISFJ mom is emotionally exhausting [ENFP]	I (ENFP) haven't really ever had problems with my mom. Growing up, she was always emotionally supportive of all of her kids, she never pressured us to try anything, she always knew how we felt, and she always knew what to say. Basically you could insert any cliched good-mom adjective and she was that. Since starting college, though, I can't stand to be around her. Anytime I get into a conversation with her, even about the most casual of topics, the way she communicates completely stifles any sort prior excitement I had about talking about it. She just sort of sucks the energy right out of me. It's exhausting.\n\nSo here's some backstory: growing up, she would often say that she felt her one true purpose on Earth was to be a mom. She's also a nurse, and to add to that, we always had a ridiculous assortment of pets at my house (e.g. dogs, cats, horses, birds, rats, hamsters, ferrets, skunks... the list goes on). Basically, she's an ISFJ caregiver at heart.\n\nHere's the catch:\n\nThroughout her life, she's had a string of bad relationships. My alcoholic dad cheated on her twice until she left him, she started dating another alcoholic (who actually treated her alright, but hated my older sister) and shortly broke up with him. Since 2011, she's been in a relationship with arguably the worst of the worst: a controlling, suicidal alcoholic who is fifteen years younger than her. Their relationship has been absolutely toxic; he has threatened to kill himself multiple times if she leaves him and he even put a tracker in her phone without her knowing so that he could see everything she did/everywhere she went. Totally insane, I know.\n\nAnyway, all us kids hate him. He's unintelligent, fake, and just outright awful. But she's stayed with him because of her insecure attachments, low self-esteem, and fear of loneliness. It's truly a bummer. She deserves so much better.\n\nAnyway, after my twin brother (also ENFP) and I left for college, she officially turned into an empty-nester. I think this must have been traumatic for her because she sort of went off the deep end a little bit. She stopped calling us, was super emotional and vulnerable anytime we tried to talk, and was overtly resentful of us for not "appreciating her".\n\nSubsequently, I've started resenting her, too. It's not really anything I can help her with, either; I feel like she just doesn't understand me anymore. For example, I'll bring up a topic (say, open relationships) and I'll try to spark up an interesting conversation with her about it. What inevitably ends up happening, though, is that she assumes that I'm in an open relationship and then freaks out and questions my sense of morality and her own parenting. It's so frustrating. Literally, one time I told her I was OK with smoking weed, and she cried. And I never know what to do in those instances.\n\nIt goes deeper than this, too. What sparked this post was our conversation about sex (we're pretty open about that stuff) and she just went off about how my dad cheated on her and how he messed her up permanently, etc. This sort of self-victimizing behavior happens ALL the time, and once it starts, it just sort of spirals out of control. She'll stop listening to any logical input I have about the situation and quickly assume everything I tell her stems from the self-imposed belief that everyone thinks she's worthless and nobody cares about her. Even when I'll literally say, "We all love you, nobody thinks that, you're being unfair to yourself," she'll interpret that as me saying "you're crazy and delusional."\n\nBasically I need some help in how to communicate so that she'll feel validated. She won't listen to anything I say, she won't go to therapy (even when we've talked about how transformative it can be), and she spins anything my siblings and I say into this negative, self-deprecating idea of herself. All of us siblings are super open with each other, emotionally stable and intelligent, and get along great. We love open discussions about a bunch of different topics (all N's) and we have the same sense of humor. And we all have talked about how our mom has gotten to the point that we can't even have a normal conversation with her without being on our toes the entire time.\n\nI just want to be able to have uninhibited conversations with my mom again, so if anyone could offer some advice or even just some reassuring words, that'd be great.\n\ntl;dr: My ISFJ mom goes on shame spirals when I talk to her and I need help validating her while simultaneously feeling like I'm authentically communicating my ideas to her.
8	Honestly, this doesn't sound like an ISFJ specific problem, but more of a depression/self-esteem type of problem.\n\nIf she won't go to therapy, I'd advise you to tell her about a tool I've found useful when I'm low on self-esteem or being self-depreciating: Write the negative thoughts. Write out contradictions to these thoughts. (example: I'm a bad mom because my son is okay with smoking weed/I've done the best I can and my son makes his own choices etc. etc.) \n\nIt's hard to force yourself to do but very worth it.
2	My ISFJ mom is also prone to assuming the worst of everything (which might include everyone). That said; my ISFJ partner is not like that at all.\n\nA little cough? Disastrous. Daughter had too much to drink? It's the end of the world. Menopausal? All her daughters fucking hate her. Said "fuck!" about something? Her daughter is rude as hell and will be swallowed alive in the working world, haha.\n\nI think A LOT of patience and validation will be good for both you and her. Don't argue with her. Let her vent. Let her nag. She's a great mom isn't she? Doing this for her should be nothing compared to what she's done for you, EVER. Thankfully, I'm good at this. \n\nHowever, there was once where she pushed and pushed my boundaries and had tantrum after tantrum. She could not stand up to my (narcissistic) Sister and was projecting all her anger on me. I was tired of being thrown around and I yelled at her to stop it and get a grip. She was extremely hurt, but she got the message.\n\nWould I do it again? Never. I hate hurting her. That was a very rare exception because she was so so SO blind with anger and really hurting me, her main form of emotional support.\n\nISFJs are very very delicate people. The fact that she treats you this way is good, because at least she is sharing and opening up. You should REALLY be worried when she clams up.\n\nConclusion: be endlessly supportive and validating. Do not ever dismiss, belittle, hurt her — a shock is not warranted unless she is acting completely out of character and being self and other-destructive.
1	Have you actually told her how you feel? In words? I obviously don't know your mom, but as a fellow ISFJ I generally pick up on how those around me feel, especially if they're lying or being insincere. I can't always figure out why, but I notice it. It would kill me to know my behavior was making those I cared about crazy. If you tell her I bet she'll be motivated to make a change. Best of luck to you both. 
0	I'm not sure how useful this'll actually be, but one thing that stuck out to me is her feeling unappreciated. I know you tell her you love her, but do you go out of your way to make sure she knows that you appreciate the things that she does for you? Not to say that the changes in her behavior/your relationship are your responsibility at all, but if you're looking for ways to boost her self-esteem/open lines of communication a bit, that might be a good place to start. It doesn't have to be over the top, just make sure you're sincerely saying thank you for any little thing she might do for you, or thank her for something she did in your childhood, that kind of thing. My mother and I are both ISFJs and we're best friends, and that's one of the things that I'm always conscious to be doing and which I think has helped our relationship a lot. My (probably INTJ) brother rarely says thank you for things and often talks down to her/rejects her input, and their relationship is a lot more strained, so I do think it's something that's genuinely very important to ISFJs because we're so service-oriented a lot of the time. \n\nThat being said, it sounds like her latest relationship is a hugely toxic influence on her life, so that may be effecting her more than you know. People who are in abusive relationships can get very defensive and take those stresses out on other people in their life, so that may be part of what you're experiencing (and she *is* in an emotionally abusive relationship, just to be clear). 
17	How do you keep conversations going with ISFJs?	Hi, I know few of you guys yet you guys are one of my favourites.\n\nI find an issue is that my close ISFJ friends don't continue conversations with me, especially if they are too philosophical or heavy. Not implying that they are unintelligent, because they are very intelligent, but rather, I think they find it irrelevant or too touchy.\n\nThey enjoy small talk — knowing about my life or the lives of the people around me, even if they don't know them.\n\nQuestions I have are:\n\n* Do you zone out because those topics are boring to you? \n\n* How do you like someone to carry a conversation?\n\n* Why are you reserved even with your most loved one? How can your partner ease you into opening up?\n\nThank you.
25	Thanks for taking time to write this question! \n\nI would say that deeper, intellectual conversations are less important rather than boring(it sounds the same doesn't it?). I don't know about other ISFJs, but for me I don't really like it when there's a potential for another side to argue a point. If someone is talking about the creation of the world, I don't want to give my input in fear that it would be opposing their views or potentially causing discord. That basically works against Fe and for that reason I, personally, don't like those intellectual conversations. \n\nIn terms of how I like people to carry conversations, I like to know how their lives are going. I enjoy listening to their ups and downs of the day and then asking questions based on their responses. I also enjoy just listening them talk about their interests and hobbies. I will also ask questions based on their responses. As stated earlier, if their interests consist of those deeper multi-sided topics, I can only do so much before I try to switch topics. \n\nOpening up is a weird concept. Again, not sure about how other ISFJs view it, but I feel like I need permission to speak. There are many friends that I won't really speak my mind to unless I'm prompted. I feel like if they don't ask, then they're not interested and thus won't acknowledge my opinions on a topic. I know that isn't usually the case, but that's how I feel. The times that I like to open up are when my opinions line up with others' opinions. This assures me that I won't cause any serious discord or unnecessary arguments. One thing I should mention is that I will open up more(without prompting) to those that I have daily connections with. By seeing a person consistently, I feel like they observe me on a daily basis and better understand my ups and downs and it will be easier for me to open up without explaining a lot of backstory(less talking too). So for example if I'm at school, I would open up more to someone that I sat next to because they could ask me how I was doing and what my day was like and I could follow up the next day which then could open up many avenues for conversation. \n\nThere's a lot more I could talk about and this is already pretty lengthy. If you have any more questions feel free to reply or PM me!
4	I zone out mostly because, like mentioned above, it's not really relevant to me; however, recently I've discovered that if I am interested in the topic I might zone out because I need to really sit, think, and formulate my ideas before continuing the conversation. 
3	I'm on the contrary, I personally like talking philosophy/new ideas (I mean, we can't all be the same person right?). \n\n\nFor me it's weird, I don't really like small talk, but I naturally do it. It's my fallback conversation with people I don't really know/aren't that close with. In the end, it is basically me asking questions and the other person answering. However I can't sustain such a conversation because on the back of my mind, I feel it would be boring for the other person. I think us ISFJs are the type of people that draw closer to people who cater to our interests, and I personally deem those conversations fulfilling. \n\n\nAs for your third question, I won't speak my mind because of personal insecurities. In my environment, talking feelings is barely done, if not, none at all, so I fear people around me would view me as that "feelings" guy. I reserve them unless I'm prompted to speak, which quite frankly would probably never happen. \n\n
1	I feel like it really depends on the subject. There has to be some sort of interest or it's just not something that they would want to continue talking about. \n
1	You're spot on about us (well at least me) not liking talking about philosophical/heavy topics. I only feel comfortable talking about them with my brother who I am quite close to, and even then, I sometimes shut it down because I don't want to deal with it.\n\nThe biggest reason I think is that I just don't want to offend anyone with my opinion. It's too touchy as you said. Also it's just frustrating to talk about philosophical things because there is no RIGHT way that the thing can go. For example if my brother and I are talking about time travel... like something about that frustrates me because there's too many possibilities of how the laws of time travel should/could work.\n\nI RARELY zone out when I'm talking to people. Usually I listen intently and I can bring whatever was talked about up like months later if needed. I just don't always contribute to all conversations. The only time I start to zone out a bit is when my brother talks about tangent universes or string theory... things I just am not too interested in or are too philosophical for me again. I try to understand them but I think it would take me a long time to get it and I don't want to bother my brother by making him explain it in simpler terms, or several different ways.\n\nIt's hard to say what will help me open up even with my most loved ones. I have trouble expressing my emotions in words sometimes, so I just don't do it. There are people who I have trusted before, but I have shut out because they seem to not want me to confide in them, or they have done something "wrong" in my eyes. Example of this would be my dad who cheated on and left my mom a year ago -- it was inherently wrong what he did. And I can't get into any personal conversations with him now. Well even before that he is my other example of being reserved :P. I have come to him with problems before which might seem minute to other people, but to me it was a big deal, and he offered no help or feedback. If an ISFJ is asking you for help/advice it's taken them a lot to do so! At least for me, I hate asking for help.\n\nTo add onto that, this might be because of the way my parents conditioned me, but I feel like I don't want to open up around other people because it will burden them. This might partially be the whole "you're making me feel bad because you feel bad" attitude my parents had toward my anxiety, which basically made me just shut up and bottle my emotions up. And if I can't open up with my immediate family... I can't do it with anyone else. (Unless it's anonymous online lol).\n\nSo I guess the best way to get an ISFJ to open up to you is to establish a lot of trust with them and show that you are not judging them for anything they say. You can always get on my good side too if you bring up something I had said in a previous conversation and ask how it is going. Sort of like showing you care in whatever way possible. You gotta make ISFJ's feel appreciated :D and then they will give you the world if they can.\n\nI'd say try starting small with the whole trust thing like... ask what their favorite food is or something. Even little things like that for me I get iffy about whether I should really tell people or not. Because do they even care? Or do they care so much that it will anger them if I say the wrong thing?\n\nThat's just a bit of my thought process. I'm not sure if it goes for all ISFJ's. Maybe it is in line with the extremely anxious ones though lol\n\nEdit: I know this long but I thought of one more thing! A lot of the times when I open up, I will do it jokingly just to test the waters. If the person agrees or takes the "joke" seriously I know it's okay to talk about with them. For example I will sometimes make really dark jokes like about my dad leaving or my dog dying... I have an ISFP friend who doesn't even acknowledge these, an ISTP friend who laughs at these and will bring the topics up later (which I like because it shows they listened), and an INTP friend who will take it more seriously and be like "that's really sad/horrible". I've opened up to the INTP friend the most about deeply personal stuff. Again, maybe that's just me though!
2	Any ideas on dating another ISFJ?	Hi, fellow ISFJ here. I have recently met a girl, and after a couple of dates I would place her as an ISFJ too. She seems very nice and I am interested in giving it a chance, although I am a bit concerned with both of us leaning towards Introverted. (My score was about 55% Introvert). \n\nDoes anyone have any experience or thoughts about this? Will it be a problem with both of us wanting the other to depend on the other, can it get "quiet" when both are social, but lack the natural conversations that are typical for extroverts. Or do you think it can be a peaceful and fulfilling relationship? \n\nI'm really curious to hear your thoughts, thanks.
2	Hard to say, just go for it see what happens. There's no way that we could judge whether this is a good or bad idea in the long run. If you're into her then you've got the ingredients to make it work.
1	INTJ here with an ISFJ wife. Both of us being introverted means we love spending time with one another, which is good for any relationship. However, I am more extroverted than her (I can turn it on when I need to) which means sometimes we do go into social situations and I can guide the process which is quite uncomfortable for her. I'm sure this doesn't help you a whole lot, but it works quite well for us.
1	My parents are ISFJ and ISTJ and they've been very happily married for over 30 years. They don't really have friends outside of our family, but they're truly content with that because they're each other's best friend and find their relationship very fulfilling. Your relationship could potentially get stagnant depending on the two of you and your particular circumstances, but two introverts can definitely get along just fine!

2	Honestly how would you describe your normal posture? Standing and Sitting.	As well as neck posture pushed forward or in line with spine.
1	Bad.... When I'm standing my shoulders are always a little slumped, although I feel like it's not as bad as it could be, but my sitting posture is a goddamn mess. I hunch like nobody's business, which I guess makes my neck push forward some? Not as sure on that front, haven't paid much attention to it. I go through phases of trying to improve it, but since I have ADHD the thought tends to slip my mind almost immediately and never return..... 
1	When I was in third grade I decided to have good posture so for like three weeks I focused on it and now I have good posture
1	Hmm, maybe like a football player with all the equipment. My shoulders are kinda high.
1	I have bad posture from sitting at a computer desk nearly all day for the past 12 years. My neck is kind of forward as you said because of this. \n\nI started trying to do those exercises where you stand up every 20 mins. And the ones where you keep your arms raised above your head on a yoga mat to try to fix my neck.
3	Any of you like roller coasters?	I have an ISFJ mom and friend; while my mom hates them my friend loves them. I'm wondering out of curiosity.
2	Can't do em, I hate that swoopy stomach feeling 😑
2	I love them. Going backwards on them bothers me now though
2	ISFJ here, LOVE roller coasters. The thrill of them gets me every time, regardless of how nerve-racking simply standing on line is, awaiting my impending "doom"
2	I don't like them that much but I think it's more to do with my anxiety than my personality 
1	I like roller coasters but they don't excite me a huge amount; then again nothing much excites me.
1	I sure do seem to like my emotional roller coasters, does that count?
1	I fucking love roller coasters. \nI love the sensation of my stomach about to fall out of my butt. 
1	I love them, but I have to build up to it. But after I do it, I love the rush!
1	Well once I'm on them I tend to like them but I'm generally scared of them.
1	I hate rollercoasters haha. I always feel like I'm gonna be thrown from my seat or something awful will happen. Too scary for me, wrong kind of scary heh.
2	Please sir, thoughts on the poor INFP	For a study being conducted by yours truly.
7	You're beautiful. You have a tenacity and love for all things that is so incredibly attractive. The way you speak about feelings flows like water. You can often turn situations around and keep them positive and upbeat even when it feels like there's no saving it. \n\nBut you can be so unreliable. Maintains a schedule (even a basic one) can be so difficult. We can pick up that slack, but sometimes things are beyond our control, in which case it seems like they are most definitely beyond yours.  You speak beautifully about feelings but they are often your own feelings. The concept of truly feeling the feelings of another is foreign to you. You can absolutely feel, but they are your feelings, not those of another. \n\nAll in all, you really are amazing. But it's hard to trust you with my deepest self. 
9	Internal struggle	Hey all, Im an isfj and Im wondering if any of you have similar experiences. \nSo Im definately a hugger. I always try to get as close as possible to people I care about, but then I am constantly over-analyzing and wondering if I am making them uncomfortable. I have this deep desire, almost hunger, for someone to prove they care about me through a hug or something similar, but normally Im the one who has to initiate things if I need support. As a guy, its especially hard becuase they way Iact or wish others acted are not seen as masculin, and this plays in the with overanalyzing. I would love nothing more than to just relax with a friend and snuggle in a platonic way, but nobkdy really does this.  \nAll of these factors cause me to be kinda clingy with people, which can push them away and this has really cut my confidence down. Its definately gotten better as I have learned where the line is, but I still have a need for closeness in a non romantic way.  \nCan anyone relate? 
1	Ugh I'm the same, I'm suuuch a cuddler lol.... I've been lucky enough to find some friends who are fine with me being as snuggly as I am or will at least tolerate it for a while, but if people let me I'll literally just lay on them for like an hour at a time. You are not at all alone on that front. 
1	Yep, I'm a hugger, and I know I make some people uncomfortable with it. I'm fortunate enough to be dating an ESFJ who loves hugs as much as I do.\n\nI always feel so awkward when I go to hug a friend, family member or acquaintance and they immediately cringe away. :( I love hugs from everyone, even people I don't know well.
1	Like a lot of other ISFJs, if you look in love languages threads under this sub, your love language is probably Physical Touch.\n\n\nTo *actually* answer your question, yes, I can relate. I love physical touch. There are some people I just want to be touching (in the most innocent way) all the time- leaning against them, taking their arm, holding their hand. I have ended up pushing people away because of this, though. \n\n\nAlso, for me, it definitely depends on the person I'm giving/receiving touch from.\n\n\n~~when talking about this sort of thing it can sound so pervy ugh but i mean this in the most innocent way D:~~
1	Yes, yes. I'm the same way. I feel like there's always a barrier when making a decision whether to smother a person or not. I view it as a case-by-case basis. If anything, it's good to verbalize boundaries. It may seem awkward and maybe uncomfortable for the other person, but I think it's better to know and not overstep boundaries than to not know and overstep. As a male, I do feel judged for wanting to cling onto other males. I just want to feel close to them in a non-romantic way. 
2	Stolen from INTP sub, interesting quick test on morality	
3	I read through the answer key and it's pretty clearly biased. However, I have no qualms about the bias it has. I think the greater revelation for me was that I stuck pretty heavily to my choice and agreed with it's assessment of me.\n\nThough I would question the way this test assumed "happiness," I think looking at how it did it would point out something important about our society. Who ever wrote this considers selfishness inherently mean spirited and associates personal moral greed among the lowest ways to live one's life. Whereas generosity and the ability to forgive and forget seem more ideal when it comes to deriving happiness. I don't want to give anything away from the answer key in case one of you would like to take it fresh, but I'd honestly like to hear people's arguments for or against the ultimate moral ordering's assessments of people who chose what ever order they picked. \n\nThat's where my revelation came from. The people I know and love the most happen to be like that, where they can forgive, forget, and are generally nurturing. They may not factually forget misdeeds, but they work towards happiness instead of allowing things, no matter how egregious, to get in between them and their loved ones. \n\nThanks for this, I enjoyed thinking all around it and I plan to forward this to friends. \n\nFor anyone wondering, I selected JMSR. 
1	I went with MJRS. \n\nMarion in my opinion made a great sacrifice to save two others. John did nothing overtly wrong. Robin back stabbed Marion pretty much, and I dislike him/his actions the most. But the sheriff was the cause of the whole situation in the first place so he is last.
3	help with ISFJ breakup	I broke up from a pretty long term relationship with an INFP and I am NOT coping. The reasons were because we are young and commitment is really intense at this age we both are going down different paths in our lives... you get the point. He seems to be moving forward so well, but I just really don't know what to do without that segment of my life. I feel really lost and pointless on my own?? I struggle to make decent friends who I can connect with on the level I want to connect. He has been really the only person I've had a deep connection with in my whole life, so its hard to let that go. He wants to stay friends, and of course thats what I'm doing at the moment because I'm clinging on to every last piece I can. But i know i should probably just cut him off, right? But how am I supposed to do that? I feel like I can't move on
2	I was in your shoes a couple of months ago OP! ISFJ's are really feeling people and that type of "betrayal" from someone we invested everything into just hurts. I feel like an INFP will look at the facts and it helps them move on quicker. Speaking from experience, going NC for as long as you need and immersing yourself in something else helps. Do you have any friends you can talk to? I actually strengthened a couple of my friendships bc I leant on them while I was in a bad place and it made our bond that much stronger. I was like dead on the inside for a month but now I'm doing better than I was my whole relationship, at least mental wealth wise :) if you need to talk my inbox is open!
1	I was in a 5 year relationship myself , it ended about 3 years ago , the best thing I can tell you is what I would do , for me keeping in touch with someone that I just broke up with doesn't work, I would always want to do something that makes him love me again and want to get together so it would drain me it's better for me to just cut it off and don't look back , talk to your close friends your best friend and just move on , yes you'll still think about him all the time but time heals soon it won't hurt so bad , if you ever want to talk just message me , best of luck 
1	I'm seconding the other opinions - it's better to just cut him off. It doesn't have to be an angry, toxic breakup, just explain him politely that you need to move on and staying friends doesn't help. As ISFJ you might feel guilty to do such a thing - try to fight it off. \n\nI went through something similar (although it was a bit more complicated and toxic) and somehow I felt obliged to keep in touch with her. Looking back to all of it, I see I was too submissive and lacking self-respect. Once I realized I don't have to do this, and that I wasn't owing her anything, I managed to get free and improve as a person.\n\nDo you feel very dependent on others? Perhaps you should take some time and try to find yourself. Do the things you like on your own, find some hobbies, learn to enjoy your own company. This sounds awfully cliched, but I found it to be a solid advice, regardless of MBTI type. Don't repress your suffering, it's ok to feel like this, but don't wallow in it more than necessary. Ultimately you need to learn to enjoy yourself again, and to love yourself just a little more than the others. People are drawn to other happy and confident people.
1	That's really a loaded incentive, everyone reacts differently when coping with their first big break up and personality types can give you a probability for how to cope but it's a personal journey. I remember my first break up, and I too felt that void of pointless direction. It's easier to face the challenges in life when you have a solid assist, but I put myself in a scenario where I knew this could end up as a possibility.\n\nI began thinking about how big the world is and how many others must feel the exact same way but just don't ever say shit cause it's an awkward subject. Eventually I found coping mechanisms, like trying out new things, that was about the time I started parkour picked up rollerblading again. I came to terms with the fact that the relationship did not define me and friendships literally come and go. Even your childhood friends will cater to their own life in time. It's a melancholy emotion when you do come to terms with it, and you will realize you do not want to be dependent on anything but your own will.\n\nSo my best tips would be, yes distance yourself from that which you know you do not want. Embrace the despair and use your own intuition to rebuild the process that got you into that flaw of character. Make time to dedicate to doing something new, ask strangers questions, get a feel of how it would be to be the other person you are not at this moment. You never know, you might like that person. 
8	S's: Have you ever cheated?	I'm [ENTP] part of the Intuitive Integration [INTJ, INFJ, ENTP, ENFP] page on Facebook. Recently, someone posted, asking if anyone has ever cheated. I was wondering whether the answers would changed, based on someone's N or S function. She here are the questions that were asked:\nDid you ever cheat on your partner? If yes, how does it feel the moment you actually let someone start to undress you? Update: Guilt / no guilt? Can you actually really completely enjoy it?
8	Never cheated, never will. I have seen the damage it's done to people and couldn't bare to inflict that kind of pain on someone.
6	I have. On a guy I was dating for a year during my junior year of high school. \n\nIn the moment of it happening I didn't feel really guilty. Kind of the opposite actually- like nervous excitement? It also wasn't a one time thing.. I did it several times with the same guy. Afterwards I'd feel guilty but not as much as I expected tbh, and that was surprising to me. \n\nI learned I didn't feel as strongly for my boyfriend as I thought I did and I should have ended it. \n\nI chalk it up to being young and naïve because I don't think I could do that to anyone ever again. That has been the one and only time and it was a long time ago. 
6	Never, been cheated by every gf ive had though
3	I would never 
3	No way, and I never would.\nCheating is unforgivable, in my opinion.
2	Nope
2	Nope, it's probably the only thing that I certainly will never do simply because I think it's one of the worst things you can do in a relationship.
1	Nope. 
1	Nope and never will I 
1	No, and I never could.  In a relationship, I value the other person and their feelings more than that.
1	No. It's the worst possible thing in a relationship to me. My husband cheated on me, and although I was thinking about leaving him anyway, that did it for me. I was done. He accused me of wanting someone else, but I just didn't want him anymore.  And he tells people that I was horrible to him which couldn't be further from the truth.
7	Struggling with some questions I think fellow ISFJ's could help me with	Hey everyone, so here is the thing. I'm coming back from a relationship that really messed me up,  it's been a couple of months now and I'm getting better, I'm ready to move on with my life, but I don't know where to... \n\nI define myself a lot by what I bring to others. I'm not as close with my friends as I used to be, but that's just everyone being busy with their lives, so I naturally want to get closer to someone and I'm asking myself: do I want another relationship just to quickly feel better? Should I take more time alone to learn to like myself better? On the other hand, what if it's just me being an ISFJ, maybe there is no "working on yourself" bullshit that's gonna make me happy like feeling close to someone can.\n\nSo, as anyone been struggling with the dilemma of trying to be happy by themselves, or relying on your relationships (friendship or romantic) to achieve that? Any advice on that?\n\nI'm doing fine with my life otherwise: good job, doing my master degree, exercising, eating well, etc... But that's daily routine, it doesn't make me happy or unhappy, it's just there to keep me busy.\n
10	You can be happy by yourself, and you should absolutely work on it. I have been in the exact same situation before and felt the same thing, where another relationship would have felt great because it would allow me to become close with another person. But what I realized is that a lot of the reason why I liked that was because it allowed me to essentially let them do a lot of the work for things that I'm not good at (eg. Ne). \n\nI think it's really important to know who you are and what you value, and being with someone else didn't force me to answer those questions because I could just say "I'll do anything as long as you're happy". Obviously I want my partner to be happy, but it's ridiculous to believe that it's the only thing an ISFJ wants. We're notorious for doing that, and neglecting our own needs is a pretty big shortcoming, because it's not sustainable and if you do it too long it can push you to some pretty dark places. \n\nSo I would say that taking some time is a good idea. Find out what it is that you truly desire. Ask questions about yourself. A lot of them. And be honest. Look at your past relationships as well. What went wrong, and why? These can be painful things to analyze but it's absolutely worth it in the end. That way when you do find a partner you enter the relationship as a healthy, responsible person. You have your own ambitions and they can have theirs, and you can support one another with out having to become one another. Obviously you'll value your partners happiness, but you'll be more grounded and won't need to overextend and hurt yourself again. 
2	Hey-Nabla_223, Think I can help. I'm 49, female, ISFJ, borderline INTJ, 2 marriages -one bad (divorced), one good and current. \nLike another person advised, take time off from dating, step back and really analyze your relationships. Which ones did you Enjoy? Which ones were utterly Exhausting? Really ask yourself "why did I feel that way, did I do or say things because I wanted to or because it made the other person happy"\nI am part of a healthier relationship and am much more outgoing now than before. I still have my introvert issues, but now I know how to "help myself" around them for the most part. Even though you are ISFJ, you still have the judging  trait. Learn to use it to help break down situations and consider both sides. You  will surprise yourself.
7	What is the most important thing in your life?	Don't mind me, just doing a casual survey ;). The most important thing in my life is my spirituality.
10	Relationships. All of them, but especially family and close friends. 
3	^Yes I agree with morals being high on the list. I'd have to say the people I love matter more though. Friendship!
3	Thanks for asking, these are truly critical times making it so easy to lose sight. But I agree, spirituality. That and my family.
3	My answer is spirituality, family, and friends. Identifying as ISFJ would mean that our answers would be the same if not very similar right? 
2	Family :) 
1	The people that I love.
1	My health and wellness. 
1	Close friendships, honesty, acceptance/people liking me
1	Hm. My friends, family, relationships.
1	Honestly, money. Because it's been a headache not having any and being crippled by my student debt and inability to find a proper paying job :( 
4	I hate Si sometimes	As an ISFJ, very high Si + Fe user, AND a hyperempath, I remember and get emotional over things I don't need to get emotional over. It's  awful. Then Ne comes in and messes everything up like "WHAT IF THIS HAPPENS?!?!? *police sirens*" while my Ti is like "DUDE CHILL" and it's generally just difficult - does anyone else have this problem? Something similar?
1	Sometimes? With me it's less... chaotic than you describe it. I completely understand where you're coming from though.
1	I have this problem. Still not sure how to manage it.
3	What is for you the greatest invention of the 20th century?	"Various opinion polls have shown that the greatest invention of the twentieth century the invention of the pill, because people can love when they pleased, because women no longer fear that they will become pregnant. Wonder tablet have brought sexual and indirectly, economic independence, so they can compete for better jobs and no longer fainted when they saw a mouse - were no longer dependent on male stereotypes about women. Thanks to contraception have entered into a contractual relationship. The emancipation of women is actually a paradox of imparting a freedom because women requires more and more responsibilities and duties. What they once represented as a great social achievement and privilege today they are experiencing as a form of oppression." (Europeana: A Brief History of the Twentieth Century by Patrik Ouredník)\n\n\nA price of freedom? "Glorious" capitalism; crazy feminism!\n(What do you think?)
2	ISFJ here; I think I would agree with the article. It's absolutely a more philosophical take on the subject ("what invention has created the most societal progress" vs "what's the coolest thing we've made in terms of sheer science") but I can definitely see where they're coming from and agree. For a long time in our society, childbearing and rearing have been huge obstacles to women becoming more prominent members of society. \n\nWhich isn't to say that it's impossible to do anything great if you have kids, far from it, but it does make working and studying far more difficult, particularly if it's difficult to control how many children you have or when you have them. It's provided women with not only more sexual freedom, but also more financial autonomy and therefore the ability to pursue any career or field of study that they want without having to worry about children. I think women (who are a full half of the population who previously had a much more difficult time making their voices heard in things like business and science, not to mention that they also often provide a different point of view on things than men) having more choice over if and when they have children has been a huge contributor to much of the progress we've been making in the 20th and 21st centuries, so I would say even if hormonal contraception isn't the most obviously "wow" invention, it's probably one of the most impactful. \n\n(Not to mention that hormonal birth control can be extremely helpful in treating a variety of women's health issues, not just controlling pregnancy.) 
1	Wow, I never thought of birth control pills as one of the greatest inventions... I always hear "sliced bread" haha...\n\nAfter thinking about it, I kind of agree though. Many great inventions of the past almost seem detrimental today (in terms of reducing the work people had to do through mechanization = eventually less work for people to do... automobiles/quick transportation = greenhouse gas emissions/temps rising... better weapons/stealth equipment = less "personal" fighting/easier to kill?). We've had lots of progress, but look where we are today...
0	ENxP, here.\n\nI think it's the Internet. It has a bigger place in my life.\n\nI think women are more free, not because to phoney pharmaceutical blessings, but because they are enlightened by mankind's knowledge and intelligence. (M'lady. \*Tip fedora*) Thanks to communication and free sharing of knowledge, than anything concrete.
3	Isfj's have you dated ISFP?	Im wondering if any od you dated an ISFP before and what was your experience like?
3	I dated an ISFP. Our relationship was mediocre at best. It started out intense and awesome and just slowly turned into a mess. He was very anxious and relied on me a lot for emotional support. This led to me becoming more anxious and the relationship kind of imploded because of it. Both of us were unhappy and I ended up having to break it off with him (interestingly enough, he had always been the dumpee, never the dumper). There was a lot more factoring into his behavior than being an ISFP, so take this with a grain of salt. 
1	INFP here.\n\nMy dad is ISFP and mom is ISFJ.\n\nI think it works in large part thanks to  the fact that my mom adores her children and my dad fully supports her in that and is very noble about being a father.\n\nOther than that he basically lives to please her and in turn she gets all the shit done that he couldn't sort out on his own. He's also more of a sociable and artistic person than she is, which I think she admires.\n\nI read overall it's quite a happy and workable arrangement. They are both devoted to one another.
1	I'm an ISFJ married to an ISFP - we have some differences in motivation sometimes but overall it works pretty well, we're both pretty even-keeled and easygoing, though we can both be bottlers so we have to remember to pursue each other's feelings.
1	I've had an on-and-off thing with an ISFP for about 5 years now. We never really made it "official" but we always seem to come back to one another and talk daily.\n\nOur personalities always end up clashing. At some times the relationship becomes kind of abusive (might just be because he's an addict, but from my understanding drug use is common for ISFPs?). For example he will say really hurtful things while drunk and I'll forgive him the next day, or if it's really bad, after like 3 weeks or something. Once I decide that I like someone its hard for me to let them go. We have amazing chemistry in bed so that doesn't help when I try to forget about him...\n\nBottomline... he's very dear to me and very fun to hang out with but his temperament can change in a split second from lovey dovey to feeling attacked and getting defensive over some small thing I say or point out. I love him, but I know I could/should never commit 100% to him in a serious relationship because I know it wouldn't be as "traditional" as I would like.
15	ISFJ's, what is the way to your heart?	
37	As sad as it may sound, literally just expressing and consistently reaffirming that you like me/care about me lol. I've developed my first real crush in ages lately, and it won't go anywhere, but with their warm personality, all they had to do was make it clear that they enjoy talking to me. They're like this with a lot of their friends, but they call me pet names and speak very affectionately to me and they don't mind if I come to them when I'm upset or having a bad day, and it just makes me feel like my insides are gonna fall out in a good way. I hardly ever get crushes, but they managed it in the space of like four conversations even though we're still really not closer than average friends. 
21	Little gestures that show someone cares is really special to me.\n\nWhen I first started dating my boyfriend, we went on this scavenger hunt sort of event, and he was checking ahead of time that the meal stop had a vegetarian option, because I don't eat meat. That just about melted my heart.\n\n\nHe's always checking to see if I'm hungry, cold, comfortable, whatever. That means a lot, because I'm not super likely to speak up about that sort of thing if I'm in a new environment or around someone I haven't known for a long time. \n\nHonestly, it's the sweet little things that mean the most to me. He'll wrap a blanket around me if I look cold, he'll tie my shoe if he sees it come untied, he'll put his hand on my back to guide me if I don't know where I'm going. \n\nHe really won me over be showing kindness and concern for my well-being. I think ISFJs are so used to taking care of everybody else, nobody ever takes care of us, so when somebody does, it means a lot. A good sense of humor always helps, too.\n\nAlso, I love affectionate people, personally. I tend to be pretty shy about expressing my feelings for people, whether it's friends or a love interest, so I really enjoy being around people who aren't afraid to show a warmer side to them. Most of us love hugs, in my experience. 
4	Someone posted this to the subreddit several months ago and I've always found it incredibly accurate! Definitely worth a read!\n\nhttps://mbtipopculture.com/2016/01/04/the-isfj-sex-dating-and-love/
1	Do something that shows you think of me, give me things that suit me without me having to tell you exactly what i want.
4	What's your love language?	Heya fellow ISFJs, sorry if this has been posted before. So yeah simple question, what is your love language?\n\nIf you don't know, you can take a little (but fairly long) test [here.](http://www.5lovelanguages.com) :)\n\nMy highest one is Physical Touch, and a close follow up is Quality Time.
2	Physical touch is my #1. Second was a tie between quality time and words of affirmation.
2	I got a 1st place tie between Quality Time and Physical Touch, followed by Words of Affirmation. \n\nSounds about right. \nI just want to find that one woman to love and spend the rest of my life with, and I'm not afraid to show my love for someone special through words, actions, and meaningful physical contact.\n\nI don't need gifts, or anything of the sort. \nAll I need is to know that the woman who I will love, above anyone else, feels the same way.\n\nNow I just have to find that woman, instead of ones whose hearts already belong to someone. 
2	Acts of Service -> Quality Time -> Words of Affirmation -> Receiving Gifts -> Physical Touch\n\nProbably worth noting that I only had 1 in Physical Touch. Which is an improvement from when I took this test 5 years ago and got 0.
1	Mine is physical touch followed by gifts
1	11	Quality Time;\n7	Physical Touch;\n6	Receiving Gifts;\n5	Words of Affirmation;\n1	Acts of Service
1	Quality Time -> Physical Touch -> Words of Affirmation -> Acts of Service -> Receiving Gifts.
1	Ahh these are fun! I got: \n-10 Physical Touch\n-8 Acts of Service\n-8 Words of Affirmation\n-3 Quality Time\n-1 Receiving Gifts
1	Physical touch and quality time.
1	10   Quality Time\n7	Acts of Service\n6	Words of Affirmation\n4	Physical Touch\n3	Receiving Gifts
1	12	Quality Time\n7	Physical Touch\n5	Acts of Service\n5	Words of Affirmation\n1	Receiving Gifts
1	Looks like there's a trend of physical touch and quality time being at the top. I suppose Si has something to do with it?\n\n7 Physical Touch, 7 Quality Time, 6 Acts of Service, 6 Words of Affirmation, 4 Receiving Gifts
1	Late to the party. I'm DEFINITELY Physical Touch (I get so clingy with my friends it's terrible) and Quality Time. And in situations where it'd be weird to touch the person (not in an inappropriate way, grow up), I rely fully on spending time with them. 
5	Does ex isfj still remember me?	I'm an INTJ and a few years ago had a relationship with an isfj, it lasted a couple of years and was usually very hot or very cold, on again, off again, sort of thing, i came to learn when it was off again, she was with someone else, but that's aside from the point, i find myself checking out her facebook and wondering if she still wonders about me?
7	ISFJs have exceptional memories, and I personally remember most of the people I've known throughout my life, especially if they had a strong impact on me in any way.\n\nI still think about my exes, even though I'm very content in a relationship currently. It's not that I'm still hung up on them, it's more that I like to remember the good times that made me happy.
1	Probably. It depends on the person of course, but even as an ISFJ with a terrible memory (thanks, ADHD) I still remember quite a bit about people who left a strong emotional impact on me even years later. I tend to cut ties hard and completely, but I still think about people afterwards even though I don't let myself check up on their social media. 
1	I can guarantee she'll remember if you were that close. As to whether or not she'll reach out, depends on how it ended. It can cause great emotional pain to go back to something like that if it wasn't very clean, and thus she may stay away, but if she is healthy enough and get get past it then you may be safe to say hi and get along with her fairly well. 
1	I remember that time in 4th grade when I sat next to someone my age on a bus and we both said "you look familiar." I didn't see him again until we ended up at the same highschool five years later.  
1	Yeah, definitely. Even if she already moves on, she most likely remembers you, or has you in the back of her mind SOMEWHERE.
1	Definitely. I still remember a guy I dated for less than a week in 7th grade.
11	How do You Relax?	I know that I love solitude when I relax, and internet connection (of course). I've also started taking a yoga class, so I was wondering what helps the rest of you de-stress at the end of the day.
12	listening to music alone
10	Solitude and a clean house is very relaxing
3	Generally doing stuff I like, alone. \n\nSometimes I spend too much time mindlessly browsing the internet, reading threads on forums but rarely engaging in discussions. I enjoy playing videogames, reading, watching movies. \n\nI notice these cycles in my methods of escapism: at some point I'm binging on arthouse movies, then a month later I'm catching up with videogames, and then after several weeks I switch to reading medieval history books, and then back to movies - I'm always focused on a single type of media at some point. Right now I'm into TV series (although I actually dislike most of them) - those Mondays are easier to bear knowing that soon I'll be back at home with a cup of hot tea in hand and the new Westworld episode on my laptop's screen.\n\nOn another note, yesterday I found [this article](http://www.inc.com/melanie-curtin/neuroscience-says-listening-to-this-one-song-reduces-anxiety-by-up-to-65-percent.html) and I listened to the songs there. It really worked for me.
2	As much as I hate to admit it, exercise does help keep me peaceful. In the more traditional sense, I love taking baths, and I think snuggling down in my new electric blanket is probably the closest I'll ever get to experiencing heaven. The internet is a terrible, wonderful distraction, and it's a little embarrassing, but I have a slew of phone games I rotate between. I write and draw, but those hobbies aren't really *relaxing* the way mind-numbing dragon raising or resource farming are, unfortunately lol. 
2	Being alone or with pets - I can't relax around other people, only animals - typically reading articles on the internet, or gardening, or playing a game like Cities: Skylines or Sims 2. Exercise helps me to de-stress but it doesn't help me relax all that much - I need something that forces me out of my own head (and focusing on something else) to do that.
2	Listening to music by myself is usually how I prefer to relax. \n\nOr watching movies with my boyfriend. He's really good about letting me be quiet when I need to, and he's one of the few people I've met who actually makes me feel recharged, rather than drained, after spending time with him. Plus, it's hard not to feel relaxed when I'm cuddling with someone super warm. 😂
2	Video games, anime, or just watching/looking up random funny stuff
2	Reading , running , gaming, Pinterest 
1	Watching youtube, reading things online about MBTI and things alike, or just random things that seem interesting. Reading fiction too, watching a movie maybe. All either up in my room alone on my bed, or downstairs with my parents and my brother. It depends a little on if I need to be alone or around others haha. :)
1	I usually do a puzzle book, or put on some tunes while I'm cleaning or washing the dishes. I play video games during the weekend, that definitely helps calm me down. 
1	Music, music, music, and gaming.
1	I like to write, fiction specifically. It allows me to comprehend and interpret the world around me, to put some control back into my life. 
1	Chilling alone (listen to music, watching anime/youtube, or playing video games).\n\nSpending time with family, or with 1-3 close friends (watching a movie, talking over a meal, or playing some games, or doing some recreational activity)
1	Working on music or just playing guitar. The working on music bit is great until I hit a roadblock and then it's pure work, but it makes me feel great. Listening to music is always therapeutic for me. Other than that, exercising and longboarding. Reading a book is always nice, too.\n\nEDIT: Just realized this is a month late lol
2	ISFJ male action figure	
3	Do ISFJs do well as a nurse? I'm a female ISFJ but trying to get into nursing school. 
1	That made me laugh. :')
0	what's your height and weight?	Can you please answer that question in [this survey](https://goo.gl/forms/PQQOrIHHCAQoyBM63)\n\nWill share the result afterwards.\n\nThanks you\n
9	... that's an idiotically irrelevant survey.
7	Mistyping ISFJs (Online Tests)	Have any of you been mistyped, and how did that affect you? I took an online mbti test about 3 times and always get INFJ, but as far as cognitive functions go I identify as ISFJ.
10	The last few times I took the online tests I got typed as INFJ. Only recently I realized I am actually ISFJ. It affected me more than I like to admit. First time when I got INFJ, I read the description and it all felt so relatable - for the first time in a long while I felt understood. \n\nThe thing is, the online description of types doesn't help too much - there's significant overlap in the way we interact with other people, and both IXFJ types share those little things that make you go "omg, it feels so good to not be the only one who does that". The difference is that INFJ seem to be portrayed way more glamorously, while the ISFJ are often described, to put it bluntly, as being boring gullible sensitive introverts. It's a stupid stereotype, and it's only natural for those first attempting to type themselves to fall into the trap of confirmation bias - minimizing the undeniable clues of Si and trying to find instances of Ni using.\n\nWhat helped me convince I'm actually ISFJ was [this insightful post on tumblr](https://intj-confessions.tumblr.com/post/130602418373/intj-vs-istj). It's about INTJ/ISTJ, but I feel it applies also to the INFJ/ISFJ dilemma.\n\nAs I said, the realization of being actually an ISFJ affected me a lot. Not necessarily because it's a less "cool" label, but because I realized I am actually an unhealthy ISFJ and I was trying to lie my way into INFJ to cover the issues I seem to have. You know, being the weirdo of the MBTI classroom somehow absolved me from doing some serious introspection. But this big knot of negativity and emotions is still there inside me. I still have no idea how to deal with it, but it's certainly better not to bury it deeper by lying to myself. \n\nSorry for venting. I had in mind writing an even longer post on /r/mbti about these online tests and descriptions but somehow I didn't find the time yet.
5	Yeah, I usually get INFJ and ISFJ with equal frequency on tests, which I guess makes sense since they're so totally unreliable. It took me a while of reading up on cognitive function theory to figure out which I really was, but I'm definitely Si-Ne; Ni is a strange and foreign creature to me lol. 
3	I think tests often ask questions like: Do you often think about the purpose of human life? and deep questions like that aimed towards intuitive types, though sensors seem just as capable of thinking about deep issues. A more accurate question may be: Do you prefer to get all the facts before you see the big picture, or see the big picture before you get all the facts? This is an INTP saying this, so maybe you have totally different ideas on this.
3	Same. I always type as one of these two. 
5	ISFJs: Whaddya think about Trump?	
22	Absolutely horrific. Literal human garbage, and the fact that people actually want to vote for him inspires both disgust and sympathy, because it speaks to how pathetically ignorant and deluded people in this country are, but also to how corrupt and damaging the oligarchy we live in has become. 
21	He brings out the absolute worst in people; the issue is that his supporters have been here the entire time, and now that Trump has given them the "ok" to speak freely, everyone thinks it's ok to think and say the horrible things that he has been.
5	He's a living caricature of all the worst qualities of the Republican Party. As a Libertarian in a completely red state, it amazes me how people will vote for him just because he is the Republican nominee. It makes me sad honestly. That's why I'm voting Gary Johnson because I believe Trump to be the most unfit to be leader of the free world. 
4	I find him pretty funny honestly
3	My ISFJ SO can't stand him. We both wrote in Evan McMullin, who is a childhood friend of mine and a terrific guy.
3	I think hes revealled more about america than anything else.  Im worried about some gay and Muslim people i know.  \n\nAt first it was a joke.  No longer laughing.
13	DEA; laugh mid way	I just noticed something and was wondering if any other ISFJ experience the same. \n\nWhile at work listening to someone telling a story, I found myself being the only one that laughed mid way because I could tell where the story was going and why it was funny. While everyone else waited for the story to finish or the punchline of sorts. \n\nDo other people not laugh mid way because its seen as rude and interrupting? or do they not see why its funny until its explained? 
9	I laugh at a lot of things no one else does. Someone will say something or do something that isn't intentionally funny but for some reason I think it's funny. And I'll laugh. And no one else will. Then I have to explain myself
4	This happens to me, too!\nI haven't actually thought about the reasons behind it. \n\nI always just assumed I had a slightly different sense of humor from other people, and I generally find the entire story to be funny, not just the punchline.
0	ENxP thing.\n\nI even sometimes rush the end of regular stories just to reach the morale quicker. It's about not wasting time in pointless salamalecs.\n\nMore than really laughing, I display more a goofy smile and let them handle how to finish the joke with best effects before laughing.\n\nI'm personally really genuine in my expressions, so it means straight face for jokes I find unfunny, and deadpan delivery of puns and wordplays.\n\nIt has it's charm as it can be seen as hopelessly rude. It has the good advantage to allow me to know who can appreciate me, and who to avoid, to not bother them of my presence.\n\nAgain, it sounds like a huge saving of my admittedly precious time, to me.
3	MBTI and video game Preferences	I was wondering if there was a way to map video game preferences with MBTI types, in particular using the eight Jungian cognitive functions. Any thoughts?
7	Dunno how to help you plot it out specifically, but I find that I gravitate more toward support roles in online games. I'm not sure if that's just a stereotypical girl thing or an ISFJ thing or a combination.
3	Well I usually go after a support role (medic, cleric etc.) in video games and Im an ISFJ.  Go figure I guess? lol
3	I know that I'm drawn towards, and am good at, being a Flex-Support in team-based ganes and a Tank in MMOs.\n\nCarrying the team to victory or putting myself between my allies and the enemy.\n\nWell, when I'm not playing solo, that is. 
2	yeah i tend to be the healer too haha. i really hate roles where i have to decide if someone is lying or something (like the jailor in TOS). i play shooting games as well but i end up trying to befriend them after they kill me.......
1	I like to play support classes as well. I've been learning Dota2 and seem to do well in a support role. However, overall I typically like to play jack-of-all-trades type characters. I like to play characters that don't have too many glaring weaknesses. Example: Pit from Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. A very simple character to understand but difficult to master. \n\nAs for genres, I typically like story driven games and platformers. I like to connect with a character and see them grow and overcome challenges. At the same time, platformers are like that for me as well. I am the one growing and overcoming challenges. There's more I like than this, but these two are the main ones for me. \n\nOn the flip side of that, I don't find myself enjoying super open-ended games. I really want to like Metroid, but I don't. There's just too many elements and open-endedness that I just can't seem to enjoy. 
1	Im always support I play wow and I'm a priest I always get compliments on my heals 😜
1	I also always go support roles. No surprise there, friends.
6	Depressed ISFJ	I am an ENFP teen who is close online friends with an ISFJ woman. She struggles with depression and anxiety, and it affects every area of her life. When an issue comes up, she shuts everyone out and insists on being alone. Sometimes she will allow me to talk to her and try to help her out, but usually I can't do much to help. A few days ago she suddenly posted, "I can't deal with anything right now... I'm sorry." and shut everyone out with no other explanation. She means a lot to me, and it hurts to see her so broken. I don't know what to do; no matter what I say she holds on to such a pessimistic view of life. How can I reach my ISFJ friend?
8	Just remind her you are there if she wants to talk. And remind her you *care* about her and want to help.\n\nThere have been a few posts on how best to help/connect to ISFJs and it often just comes down to letting us know you are there no matter. A lot of times I think I am too crazy for most people to handle, but I still wish someone could handle me haha.
1	Any luck? I hope you were able to let her know you're there for her.
14	ISFJ description detailing the cognitive functions	
3	I really like how this site describes the types by explaining how their cognitive functions work not generally but type-specifically.\n\nToo many different things I want to quote haha -- hope someone else enjoys reading this!
2	I like how it expanded on the "nurturing" side of us. I get tired of always being pigeonholed as Mother Theresa and calling it a day. I enjoyed this site quite a bit.
2	This is probably my favorite ISFJ description site now
3	Your (Fe) and stereotypes	Extroverted feeling is a function that I either don't have in my stack at all or just don't match with its stereotypical description.\n\nMost sources describe a high Fe-user as the "nurturer" or an overprotective mom. Stereotypes of not only all 16 types can be misleading, but I think particularly so for I/ESFJs, which pigeonholes us into brainless sheep that exist only to serve others. Like C-3PO and protocol droids in Star Wars. Or Alfred Pennyworth of Batman, a butler and manservant of the main hero.\n\nHow do you all who have high Fe use it in your life? How does it manifest? Do you feel it is close to the typical way it is portrayed, or is it different?\n
8	Manifests as my emotions being directly affected by external sources. If I see someone sad, I wonder what I could do to help them. If I cause a smile, I become very happy. I really cherish the few friendships I have, and would do pretty much anything for them (short of hurting an innocent person). I think I am a pretty competent judge of how people are feeling, although not so much as good a judge at what they are thinking (I suspect a lot of false thoughts that aren't there and am overly anxious I have upset someone, working on that).\n\nI *reeeeeally* don't like making people sad. If I do, even if I was mad at them (very rare lol) I instantly start trying to make them feel better... "Oh, well... I wasn't really THAT mad... come on, it's okay, don't be sad. I was just over-reacting..." blah blah blah. \n\nI don't *only* exist to serve others... but I really *enjoy* serving others, so I guess I'd just have to ask, "Why shouldn't I serve others if it makes me happy to do so?"\n\nObviously everyone has a bad day sometimes, and I can be bitchy... usually only to those I am close enough to *trust* myself being bitchy around if that makes sense. I wouldn't confide all my sad thoughts to a stranger, I'd put on a fake smile and pretend everything is okay. But if I trust someone, that means that I know they can handle my craziness so I will let them know how I really feel and want to be comforted.
5	This is kind of unrelated, but those stereotypes might be what drives me from the mbti. Makes me sad and frustrated to be called shallow, boring, and everyone's mom. "I love ISFJs because they listen and are nice to me even though they are too dumb to understand or have their own creative ideas" was a recent topic this sub. I'm not your dog ffs. \n\nThe mbti structure has really invaded my thought process, which makes it hard to get it out of my life though. 
2	 In general I really try to avoid conflict as much as possible, even if I really want to argue something I'm afraid I may hurt someone feelings by potentially getting too heated in an argument. Before making big decisions I like to consult with at least 1 person I'm comfortable with the topic about. When trying new games/hobbies I try to make sure I know people or good communities already exist and really want to be a big part of them.
7	Opinions on physical touch?	Do you like it? In what form(s) do you prefer? Does knowing the person change the level of touch? Do your preferences change with your mood? As being Si dominants, I was just curious as to how inclined ISFJs are towards touch and how it relates inward. \n\n\nPersonally, I generally like touch. Handshakes, hugs, and pats from strangers don't strike any particular chord in me. The closer I am to the person, the more inclined I am to appreciate touch. Hugs are a solid choice. High-fives, fist-bumps, and secret handshakes make me feel closer to the person as well. I like having physical contact with introverts and extroverts though I appreciate introverts slightly more as it seems like they are more comfortable with you. \n\nGiving: When I see people down or sad, I use hugs and shoulder holds as a sign of caregiving(more with friends rather than strangers). If I know they don't like touch then I look for other outlets, but touch is a common default.\n\nReceiving: When I'm emotionally exhausted or down, I long for someone to initiate touch and ideally I'd like for them to embrace me in a long hug or just let me have some sort of contact with them(head on lap, backside resting against them, etc.). I feel like I can't process negative feelings unless I have touch. When in a good mood, my wanting for touch is less, though I would still appreciate it!
6	People touching me makes me cringe I can't help it
3	Physical touch is really important to me. Generally, I don't mind hugs, handshakes, or most forms of physical touch from strangers, unless they smell bad, or I find them to be creepy or something. :(\n\nPhysical touch is definitely an important factor in making me feel loved and appreciated, and I especially love getting hugs from people I'm close to and care about. \n\nAs far as giving it, it really depends on the situation, for me. I'm typically a pretty shy person, and I'm conscious about not making other people uncomfortable, so I'm usually fairly hesitant about touching people unless I know they're receptive to it. That being said, I'm definitely a hugger, and I have made people uncomfortable in the past by hugging them when we weren't well-acquainted. I tried to hug my brother's girlfriend after he introduced us and she hung out for the day, and she really cringed away. Stuff like that makes me more hesitant in future interactions. I always love hugs, so sometimes it is easy for me to forget that not everybody does, and lots of people hate touching someone they're not close to.
3	Not a fan. Eye contact, handshakes, hugs... all of that makes me feel uncomfortable to some degree. Only person I feel comfortable doing any of that with is my s/o\n\nWhen I was growing up, my immediate family did not really express affection physically, especially my mom. But I love her dearly, and I know she loves me. But expressing that through physical gestures was never really done. We do it through practical actions, like doing a chore for one another.
2	I love hugs! Not a fan at all of the kisses on the cheeks though. The human touch is really important to me and when it's lacking it also affects me. I'm also someone who sometimes touch the shoulder or less common the upper arm for more connection. With a handshake I often do touch the shoulder/upper arm.\n\nThe touching happens most of the times with female friends and acquaintances. Despite being a guy in male dominant city I still hang out more with girls than with guys.\n\nI like giving massages as well. The physical touch while helping someone else at the same time gives me a kind of relaxing meditative experience. It are quite extensive massages though taking easily more than an hour.
2	I have been known to lay on my closer friends, and in a way them not pulling away is enough for me. They themselves are not necessarily "huggy" people, so it's usually me hugging them. With strangers I don't mind, although I am socially awkward and so it might end up being weird anyways.
2	Coming from the love language thread, it seems a lot of ISFJs are primarily or secondarily physical touch, including myself.\n\nI love physical touch. I love hand-holding, cuddling, linking arms, leaning, anything innocent. The person definitely matters- some people I would only awkwardly hug and prefer not to touch or maybe a high-five would suffice, but there are people who I want to CUDDLE CUDDLE CUDDLE. And yes, mood also matters, but that's probably normal. \n\nWhen it comes to giving, I've already elaborated, but even if I'm not close with the person at all I find myself patting them on the back or something weird like that???
1	I only like to give or receive physical touch from my mom and my husband. I guess I'll include my grandparents in there, too, even though they're no longer here.\n\nI particularly love hugs from my mom and my husband. Whether it be just to show them I love them or to feel their love for me/a source of comfort if I'm upset. I always hold hands with my mom and I would hold hands with my husband but he hates it lol so I leave him alone ;)\n\nPhysical touch with other people makes me feel uncomfortable. 
1	I love physical touch, tbh. 
1	When I was younger I use to hug everybody all the time. Friends, relatives, strangers on the street, I was all about the hugs. I was the person with the "free hugs" sign.  \n  \nNow, I am comfortable hugging my parents and my husband. My best friend forces me to hug her because she knows I hate it.  \n  \nI can't link the change back to a specific event, but it did happen over the course of a month or two maybe ~4-5 years ago.  \n  \nI use words/advice as a comfort to others as opposed to touch.
6	Attachment Styles?	Just wondering if anyone has heard of attachment styles before? Currently in therapy (yay lol) and my therapist brought up that she believes I have Anxious Attachment Style.\n\nHere is a description of it:\n\n> "You want to be close and are able to be intimate. To maintain a positive connection, you give up your needs to please and accommodate your partner in. But because you don’t get your needs met, you become unhappy. You’re preoccupied with the relationship and highly attuned to your partner, worrying that he or she wants less closeness. You often take things personally with a negative twist and project negative outcomes. This could be explained by brain differences that have been detected among people with anxious attachments." from [here](http://psychcentral.com/lib/how-to-change-your-attachment-style/).\n\nJust made me curious if others have heard of this or know their own style. Seems kind of similar to some ISFJ traits, although I think most "healthy" ISFJs are good at getting beyond these negative points.
1	[deleted]
1	I definitely have Anxious Attachment. However, because I'm conscious of this, I really make an effort to be more assertive and direct, and I dont really play games or withdraw for attention or anything like that. My natural instinct might be to fall into that sort of emotional manipulation, but I think I have a relatively good handle on it.\n\nI do still experience the anxiety, and the doubts and worries, but I think for the most part, I keep it inside, and I can talk myself through it, when it happens.
1	Well... I took this style in my dating life. But now that I have been long-term with someone I TRUST completely (this is a HUGE thing), my behavior is really different. I feel totally safe and comfortable around him. \n\nOne thing I do, which I need to work on, is when he gets upset, I get really upset. I take the fact that he's upset personally, and I start to even withdraw rather than be proactive. He thinks I'm lightly selfish in this way. But I am so sensitive to the emotions around me that it's me just not being able to handle him being upset!
1	That defines me exactly...
1	i don't seem to fit anywhere on there ...
1	I'm anxious attachment, but I think it has less to do with my personality and more to do with what I've had to deal with in the past. \n\nI mean, I can identify with "To maintain a positive connection, you give up your needs to please and accommodate your partner in." and "You’re preoccupied with the relationship and highly attuned to your partner, worrying that he or she wants less closeness." as an ISFJ though.
9	INFP dropping by!	I have a lovely friend who is an ISFJ. She's there for me when I need someone, and she's not afraid to talk about the dark sides of life. She respects my silence when I'm thinking and contemplating. I feel like she understands me and doesn't at the same time. As someone who longs for a connection, I love having her around because she cares outwardly. I see it when she's nervous. I see it when we talk. I see it when she leans a bit closer than usual when we're working on something together (totally platonic) because that's how she says, "I feel safe around you". Also, I just realized that I need more friends who are girls (I'm a dude). Anyway, you guys are great.
6	I've been good friends with an INFP for years now, he's great.\n\nI love how emotionally intelligent you guys are, and he's really the best person I could go to when I'm feeling down, or I need some advice. He's very thoughtful and wise, and he makes me laugh like crazy. We just have a special sort of bond where we can be totally ourselves around each other, and there's no judgment.\n\n\nINFPs are pretty great friends for ISFJs, once we can get past the surface differences between us, I think. :)
11	Paranoia?	Does anyone else find themselves to be too paranoid about the intentions of other people? I've started avoiding interacting with other people because I'm always paranoid they're trying to use me or manipulate me. That they have some hidden intentions.\n\nOr any other paranoia in general? Haha
5	I wouldn't necessarily call it paranoia, but I would say I'm prone to overanalyzing people's actions.\n\nFor me, I feel like it's mostly an observational thing. I spend so much time watching people closely and soaking up details about them and their mannerisms, I notice every little change in the way they behave.\n\nIf someone seems slightly down, or they're quieter than normal, or they just act a little bit different, I can drive myself crazy worrying about it. \n\n*Is it something I've done, or are they upset about something that doesn't even involve me? Are they stressed out, should I ask them about it? Maybe they need someone to talk to, but I don't want to pry...Was that comment hinting about something deeper going on in their head, or should I take it at face value?* Etc etc.\n\n\nIt can be exhausting, especially because I often end up tailoring my behavior around the subtle changes I see, but I rarely vocalize my observations, so it's a bit of an internal battle.\n\nOn the bright side, I feel like it can make ISFJs a pretty easy type of person to be around, because we generally know what kind of behavior is or isn't appropriate for a situation, I think. If someone seems like they're in a bad mood, I might be a little gentler, maybe a little warmer and quieter, and I'm not going to push their boundaries at all.
1	I'm can be pretty paranoid but I tend to dismiss it because it's usually wrong and pretty far-fetched
1	Yes, yes, and yes.\n\nMy father is very paranoid, so I think it could be a genetic thing at play. Also I've had a tendency to attract shitty people into my life that have taken advantage of my companionship. Plus, bullying in school, feeling like an outsider, poor dating experiences, wah-wah, blah blah...\n\nLike someone else said, I overanalyze people's intentions as well, but with a pessimistic twist. But I think it's just Si holding on to those negative people experiences. 
1	I find it hard to trust what people say. Anytime a friend or someone I come in contact with says anything, I find it hard to trust that what they're saying is the truth. Good to know I'm not the only one. 
1	YES! I've had people that I'm very close to hurt me in terrible ways. I've even had coworkers throw me under the bus because they needed a scape goat. Now I seem to question a lot of people's intentions and wonder if they are benefiting themselves first.
10	How existential are you?	Like, how often do you talk about the meaning of life? Do you go home and question who you are as a person? Where does your mind drift when you're not stimulated?
5	A lot. I spend too much time thinking about this, really, and also too much time reading and writing on the subject. I annoy some of my friends because I'm constantly asking those sorts of questions and wanting to discuss them. I brought something philosophical up the other day and my housemate just rolled her eyes and sighed, "Of *course* you would think of something like that." \n\nFWIW, my housemate has typed INTJ on tests but I have extremely strong reservations about that typing. 
3	I think existentially more than I should. Especially when I'm out enjoying the weather with friends I think of how life and nature is beautiful and what a great time it is to be alive despite everything going on in the world. I think a lot of people take things for granted of what we have here on earth and people should stop to appreciate what is infront of you more.
3	I think about it A LOT. Just the other day I was crying really for no reason because I thought about the meaning of life too hard and was thinking it might be meaningless for everyone.
2	I rarely talk about it but I do have existential questions and thoughts pretty much constantly.
2	Totally existential.  Between my baby and starting a business with my INTJ husband, it's hard not to.  He has to drag me out of my introspection and get me to do stuff lol.
2	Existential bummer By Jason Silva\n'Man is literally split in two:\nHe has an awareness of his own splendid uniqueness in that he sticks out of nature with towering majesty, and yet he goes back into the ground a few feet in order blindly and dumly to rot and disappear forever.' -Ernest Becker\nSo there’s a great essay written by Sigmund Freud called “On Transience.”\nAnd in it, he cites a conversation that he had with the poet, Rilke, as they were walking along this beautiful garden. And at one point, Rilke looked like he was about to tear up. And Freud said, what’s wrong? It’s a beautiful day. There’s beautiful plants around us. This is magnificent. And then Rilke says, well, I can’t get over the fact that one day all of this is going to die.\nAll these trees, all these plants, all this life is going to decay. Everything dissolves in meaninglessness when you think about the fact that impermanence is a really real thing. Perhaps the greatest existential bummer of all is entropy.\nAnd I was really struck by this, because perhaps that’s why, when we’re in love, we’re also kind of sad. There’s a sadness to the ecstasy. Beautiful things sometimes can make us a little sad. And it’s because what they hint at is the exception, a vision of something more, a vision of a hidden door, a rabbit hole to fall through, but a temporary one. And I think, ultimately, that is kind of the tragedy. That is why love simultaneously fills us with melancholy.\nThat’s why sometimes I feel nostalgic over something I haven’t lost yet, because I see its transience. And so how does one respond to this? Do we love harder? Do we squeeze tighter? Or do we embrace the Buddhist creed of no attachment? Do we pretend not to care that everything and everyone we know is going to be taken away from us? And I don’t know if I can accept that.\nI think I more side with the Dylan Thomas quote that says, “I will not go quietly into that good night, but instead rage against the dying of the light”.\nI think that we defy entropy and impermanence with our films and our poems. I think we hold onto each other a little harder and say, “I will not let go. I do not accept the ephemeral nature of this moment. I’m going to extend it forever. Or at least I’m going to try.”\n\nThis resonates with me so much I spend so much time introspecting, and finding meaning in everything I put my energy into, mainly the people around me and what their happiness means with being truly fulfilled, sometimes I wish I could just stop. But it seems like this questioning of life is a natural thing.   \n
1	I don't really think about the meaning of life in general because it's too vast a question and as a biologist I would have a hard time answering it. However, I often think about the general direction I am giving to my life and what 'impulse'  I would like to give it, if that makes any sense. \n\nI often question who and what I am, often to find myself disappointed. When not stimulated, my mind often gets stuck in a loop of thoughts about my current life. I would compare it to wandering through grey plains with old dead trees. 
1	I have a good answer, but it's both a private joke and an ironic dirty joke. =O\n\nIt would have been ironic, because it basically says I have no I idea what life is about, I just, well … \*blush*\n\nI'm not sure if you guys appreciate of my Ne dom nonsense and rudeness, anyway.

2	I thought it was interesting. Curious about everyone's thoughts and opinions about this!
5	Any ISFJs also attracted to ENTPs?	I noticed this trend for myself (I'm an ISFJ) being attracted towards ENTPs (I didn't know initially about types or anything, found out later) and was wondering if any other ISFJs are attracted or highly attracted to ENTPs? (Opinions? Good/Bad)
4	[deleted]
3	Entps are funny, smart, and interesting. They have a lot of strengths that I lack, which is cool. \n\nI can tell right away when immature ones won't be true friends though. Sometimes they don't really value people as ends unto themselves, but just as stimulus opportunities for them to perform and reinforce their identity. Since most entps I know are immature like this I honestly find none of them "attractive," just cool people. 
2	What makes ENTPs attractive to you? 
1	You caught my attention. Can you bear tell me a few words more about that, please ? =)
1	I admire ENTPs, but I've never been attracted to them. My brother is an ENTP, so maybe that has something to do with it. :)\n\n\nI think they're really funny, intelligent, sassy and ambitious, but I also find them to be a little bit overwhelming, and slightly argumentative. I don't find them to be a super compatible type, for me personally.
1	I had my best friend of many years figure out her type today and she is an ENTP! We get along pretty well because we have very similar opinions-- hence little argumentation. In social settings, we're nearly opposites and balance each other out. \n\nHowever, ENTP's are not people i'm typically attracted to in a romantic sense because in my experience, they can sometimes be overbearing.
5	Manipulation Vs Motivation	So I have been called both of these things recently by the same person, apparently ISFJs are known to be good at both, there is a difference one has negative connotations and is seen as a character flaw while the other positive and is welcomed, so I guess my question is are you aware when you are doing any of these and how to motivate others without it being interrupted as being manipulative?  \n\nManipulation is thinking of a reason others will want to do something, and then convincing them of your correctness.\n\nMotivation is genuinely seeking out the wants, needs, and desires of the other party, and then working with the other party to find solutions that meet your needs - and theirs.\n
3	Honestly, I consider them to be just about the same thing, as it's really all about perception. Manipulation is on the more... shady/hidden side of the persuasion, and motivations more transparent end. There's also personal intentions behind the actions, manipulation being more selfish, motivation being more selfless/higher cause (hence the difference in connotations).\n\nExample: my sister (ESTP) is very scatterbrained, hates making decisions and she's moving soon, so she has to clean out her atp. We sit down, I hold up a shirt I know she hasn't work in a year and looks rough b/c it desperately needs to be washed. She can't decide to keep or toss. This can go two ways based on what questions I ask, tailored to her specifically. If I ask "when was the last time you wore it?" she won't remember and probably decide to toss it. If I ask "Are you unsure b/c it needs to be washed?" she'll probably remember how it looked when she bought it and decide to keep it. Which question I ask is probably going to be based on my own subjective view on the shirt, which leads to the question: am I manipulating her, or just trying to motivate her to move the process along so we can finish by her move out date? And I think the answer to that doesn't lie with me, but with a third party's view of the interaction. If they agree with my opinion, it's probably motivation, if they disagree, it's manipulation.\n\nI embrace my manipulative side and don't view it as a negative character trait. I'm very aware of when and how I use it, especially since I work in client/customer service where the appearance that everything went right is more important than it actually going as planned. You can't control how people will view your actions (you can try--and you can get pretty far), but at the end of the day some people are gonna view the most selfless acts as manipulation and the most contrived messages as motivation based on their own personal experiences and schemas. I just kinda... fuck the haters and let them drown themselves in their pessimistic, cynical worldview while I embrace my loved ones.\n\n(lol sorry this became an essay. I do a lot of work with persuasion in my degree so these kinds of questions interest me)
1	How to get oneself motivated ?\n\nI think intent is really what makes the difference. It's really important.
12	Dear ISFJ,	
2	🤔
2	This is me (ENTP) and my wife (ISFJ)! We've always identified with Jim & Pam as our fictional couple, it's uncanny.
1	I showed this to my hubby and he laughed. lol
1	The more I interact with the xNTPs in my life the more I wonder how they managed to not blow themselves up before meeting me....
2	Blue Collar Work vs White Collar	So I basically I'm secretly jealous of all the guys my age who have apprenticeships in plumbing, electrical ect...im thinking of going back to community college and doing a course....unfortunately I've always had trouble of working with my hands and fixing things (wood work, electrical...) currently I work at a supermarket filling shelves and I've been promoted to a supervisor role which means I have more responsibility. I know I'm good at ny job (I'm the best lol) but I don't see myself working there in my future. I need to develop a skillset that will help me...a part of me wants to get into the medical field but its completely discouraged by my family. My family want me to be doing a trade rather...i just feel so lost
1	My brother what is it YOU want to do? That's the big question. What will make you the happiest? Make that first step toward it, whatever it may be. Go to trade school/apply for medical school. You have to do it. Life's too short to settle. Look before you leap, do some research, ask around, and go for it if you wanna try it.
9	What Do You Think of INTJs (Your Opposite)?	Your cognitive functions are in completely opposite orders and preferences (Ni-Te-Fi-Se).
3	My husband and one of my two best friends are both INTJs. The (female) friend really "gets" me and knows how I work, and values my warm, loyal and giving nature. My husband... is still working on figuring me out. Sometimes, he doesn't quite understand my actions as they may defy his logical expectations for human behavior.  That causes communication problems. \n\nStrangely, my other best friend is an ENTP. 
2	I love 'em. 2 of my closest friends are INTJs. I've noticed we usually have similar/complementary view son the world, but how we got to that point is usually different, which makes them really easy to work with/plan with/talk with.
2	My dad and a few of my friends are INTJs. I feel like they don't understand me, but they at least respect me and my way of life. I definitely don't understand certain things about them and they me. More often than not, I feel like they are so much further along in life and on a higher plane of being than I am. Regardless, I really respect them despite not always agreeing with them. 
1	I have a *lot* of fantastic INTJ friends, including my younger sister. I'd say I probably get on better with them than with any other type. \n\nEdit to add: it does seem like our brains work in different ways, but in a complementary way rather than a conflicting way. 
1	I find them fascinating. The way they view the world is so different from mine that it keeps me entertained for hours just asking questions about how they see things. I also find amusing the way some of them think they are so different. They make me curious.\n\nWhen talking with them I enjoy our complementary views on the world, although sometimes it's really hard to understand each other.
1	I only know one person who is INTJ and this is my personal experience with her. I find her quite stubborn :) She has her own opinion and she sticks to it faithfully, even if we present her with facts. She can be a little harsh sometimes. If she disagrees with you, she has no problem saying bad things about that. Kind of bums me out because it's a little disrespectful. Just because she doesn't like it, doesn't mean she should put it down. 
1	I just recently discovered my mom's an ISFJ, I'm INTJ, and out of everyone in my family, we have the best relationship. She's the only person I can call a true friend.
1	Well, the way i see things, Sherlock is a INTJ, and Watson is a ISFJ
2	ISFJs! What do you value in a friendship?	Okay. I'm an INFJ. My sister is an ISFJ. We don't have an incredibly close relationship, but she just had a baby so I've been seeing her more than usual. I want to develop our relationship and learn how to be there for her. So, I would love to know, what do ISFJ's value in a friendship? What is your favorite way for people to show you that they care?\n
7	I know that personally, I enjoy 1) a sense of trust along with 2) the ability to carry a conversation on their own while still 3) knowing when to listen.  It gives me the opportunity to sit back, listen and learn about a person, and the opportunity to freely speak my mind and feelings to them.
3	1) Mentally in-sync/Mental depth. I have a fairly cynical mindset and inappropriate, un-politically correct sense of humor. I enjoy people that look alittle deeper into things.\n\n2) Assertiveness/Extroversion. To get me out of my introverted shell and show what I'm made of.\n\n3) Easygoing. Being able to be ok with me not wanting to participate, and understanding of my need for alone time.
3	One way to get on my good side is to do little tasks for me. Since you said she just had a baby maybe you can help out by coming over and doing her dishes or something - new parents  in my experience are usually too busy & stressed to do simple housecleaning lol. Offering to go to the store and pick up diapers or something (or even bringing some without asking).\n\nI'm always the listener so I am always easily charmed by people who take the time to sincerely listen to my problems or seem interested in the mundane things I'm interested in (like talking about weather or traffic, or what happened to me in line at the grocery store).
2	Just came across this awesome subreddit but here goes!\n\nWhat we look for in a friendship: Anything that lets me know that you're thinking of me. I don't like talking on the phone, but for example, if you send me links to something funny you find online that would be nice.\n\nWhat I do is even if I personally don't find something interesting, but I know that I friend does, I would think "Oh, my friend would like this" so I'll forward it to him/her. \n\nNow if I send something to you, I would appreciate a response back, like "cool!" or "thanks for that!" If you don't say anything it feels like we're being ignored. \n\nPeople will need to tell us about themselves too, because we don't like one-sided friendships. If the other party doesn't share, then there's nothing we can go on. How can we move forward to a friendship if we don't know anything about you?\n\nFollowing up would be nice too. A lot of people would say that they'll do things but they forget and nothing happens. I don't like being a nag and keep reminding them. Having a "bad memory" is not an excuse. We are all adults here. If you really care about me, then you'll take it upon yourself to make things happen. \n\nBeing invited to things is a plus. Nothing hurts more than someone who talks about doing something over the weekend that they know is related to your interest, and then you were not invited. \n\nFor your sister, definitely check-in with her first. As an introvert, she might not necessarily want company and would want some time alone. She might think that she'll need to entertain you while you're there, which will just be additional stress with the baby. Make it clear that you are there to help and that she shouldn't worry about entertaining you or cleaning up the house before you arrive. That said, help her clean up or stock up her groceries etc. Also, asking her feedback too often can be stressful. Like, where do you want this stored? Where do your towels go? Where is your broom? etc etc. is more stressful than just her doing everything herself. \n\nTaking the baby out for a few hours (or for a whole day) so that she can have a nice bath or a nap would be perfect! Also, listening to her rants and empathizing with her would help. Emphasis on LISTENING and EMPATHIZING. At that moment when we are emotional, we don't appreciate being told what we should do or hearing the other side. We'll hear about it once we've cooled down and specifically asked for advice. \n\nAgain, I don't know your sister and my opinion is not representative of all ISFJs, but this is my take on it.  Hope it helps!
1	Straight up unquestionable loyalty
11	Insecurity about being super quiet even among friends	So I've had an insecurity where I'm aware I'm a very quiet person even among friends. It's not that I don't have anything to say it's the stuff I want to say I either feel is: I'm not knowledgeable enough on subject to say something, someone has already said something I would have said, what I want to say not relevant to conversation, if I say the wrong thing I'll get people angry.  \n\nEven when it comes to just talking about what I've been up to I get super conservative about talking about myself. Just don't want to bore/annoy people with my life since a lot of stuff I like isn't stuff a lot of my friends either don't know about or don't like. \n\nI just want to be more open to talk in conversations. Or just talk more about my life because I doubt it's as boring to talk about as I think it is. Anyone have any suggestions to deal with this or have dealt with this before?
6	You sound just like me. I do believe it is a confidence thing. It helps when you've got a lot of things going on for yourself and you're working towards accomplishing a goal. You have to put yourself out there and speak your mind. More reference experience will help you gain the confidence to contribute to future conversations.
3	You describe exactly how I interact with people, its annoys me so much.  
1	Lack of confidence seems to be a big part of it.\nNormally I suggest to do sports to gain confidence, but I don't know if that would work in this case. There are courses that can help you gain confidence. A former friend of me once did such a course and it did really changed her. She's standing much more her ground now.\n\nGood luck!
3	Small talk	What do you guys think of it? Do you think it's a nice way to get to know people? Or is it as useless as the commercials before YouTube videos, and you wish we could just skip to deeper conversations?\n\nI've asked this in all the mbti sub-reddits (is that what it's called?) Someone posted an article about it in the INTP group, if you want to read it, but you don't have to, just want to know what you think. -curious intp\n\nAlso I don't know how to define small talk, but I think it's safe to include social graces, work/school, and weather (I apologize if you are a weather nerd or something and actually find it very intriguing to talk about)
9	ISFJ here. \n\nI have mixed views on it. In one sense, I hate it because I feel like you just skim over the other person's day/how they're REALLY doing. There's also this stupid societal rule that you should say, "I'm good, thanks!" every single small conversation you have like you're supposed to always be "good." So I feel like it puts a mask on the person and you dont get to talk about their real mood. Of course as an ISFJ I want to have a deep conversation about the other person's life and whatnot. \n\nOn the other hand, you sometimes get little tidbits of information that add up over time. You get to know likes/dislikes, schedules, small incremental updates on a situation, etc. In a way it's kind of a daily checkup. \n\n
1	I consider small talk tortuous, but necessary. There has to be some kind of preamble for deeper conversation.
7	Career Direction????	I feel lost. I've worked as a waiter which actually gave me a lot of life experience and now I work for a supermarket. I really want to upgrade my skills either going to uni or community college. I'm just stuck on which field to go in??? 
5	I would suggest going to community college and taking a bunch of different classes to figure out what you like. I did a bunch of trial and error, jumping from chemistry to nursing to graphic design and finally ending up in communications, but what I really learned is that at the end of the day I want to manage creative people. Whether it be in a production studio for film/tv company, or at a design agency, or what I'm doing now being a house technician at a theatre (tech theatre is another interest I found along the way). If I were you, I'd figure out what exactly I want to be doing all day (for me, it's dealing with people and the logistics they bring to daily routines) and then map that onto a field I'm interested in (which you can explore through cc/hobbies around town).
1	Are you liking your supermarket job? I got a job in the pharmacy department and decided it was good enough to make a living. So that's where I focused my college studies, since I need a PharmD to "move up" in that department. If you are cool with where you are, you could major in business and try for upper management. My store manager makes six figures.
4	Feeling lost two years out after Graduating High School	What do you do to regain confidence and mental clarity after high school? I loved high school and became very emotionally attached to it, my teachers, my daily routine, and my home life. I felt in control and powerful over my home life and school life. I graduated in May 2014 and have not felt the same since. I do not feel like the "old" me who attacked everyday and looked back. Now my mind is more anxious and feel so unstable. \n\nI've lived in the same house for almost 18 years. I now live with my mom and dad and commute to community college. I went to a small Catholic school that cost $50,000 a year (I had a $19,000 a year scholarship) my freshman year, had horrible roommates that did drugs and partied, and ended up flunking out. Even though I moved back home I still haven't regained my self confidence.
1	Learn to let go. Ofc it's probably a lot easier for ENTPs to do, but you should realize that it's a new chapter in your life. The future awaits and it could be better than your high school days. Once you've accepted this transition period, I'm sure you'll find your groove again
1	I'm making some wild guesses based on minimal information here and a nearly 15 year relationship with an ISFJ:\n\nMy partner is very self motivated and driven when there is a clear objective with a plan and is something important to them. Is it possible that since highschool you haven't had a clear direction, or is the path that has been laid before conflict with what you personally want to achieve?\n\nWild speculation here, but if you have never been fully responsible or committed to your path, and someone else choose something for you it might be tricky to regulate self motivation if you're not emotionally invested into your path. And if someone has always outlined your objectives for you, than its hard to know how to practice self regulated motivation if you're unfamiliar with that process, it doesn't come naturally it's obtained through experience.\n\nMy spouse went to college, then got dream job and never missed a beat. But they plan was in motion for so long. 
5	I need help	I know lurking is predominant over actually answering as I am pretty guilty of this but... I need help. Has anyone ever had a hard time getting over someone? My boyfriend dumped me a month ago and I've gotten a myriad of different reasons for it but I just feel like they have all been lies or excuses. I can't seem to move on and forget about him even though he treated me like shit the last month of our relationship and I can see he obviously doesn't care about me as much as I do about him. I feel like I'm going crazy for loving him so much when I know he doesn't feel the same way and it kills me
6	Only thing that works well for me: break all the contact.\n\nIt's also only a month ago, these kind of things will sting for quite some time, especially when it was a bad break up.\n\nIn the end it also helps to forgive the other person to be able to finally wrap it up. I myself had intense contact with a girl (3-5) weeks, wasn't really dating, but we did had something. What we were doing got too intense for her, she needed alone time and in the end it was clear that it wouldn't work anymore. Wanted to talk it out, but she didn't want to denying me the possibility to close it up. We didn't had any contact for a couple of weeks, saw her again, noticed that I didn't liked the way I acted since I wasn't myself. Afterwards I sent her a message that I still don't like what she did, but that the way I was behaving now didn't worked either since nothing positive came from it and that she was welcome at my trainings again. It make me feel real good. It made her finally tell her side of the story as well.
3	I agree with the break all contact tip. I just got out of a relationship (barely a relationship if I think about it now) but I kept our texts and pictures and didn't block him on social media until recently. But when I did, it helped a lot. So if you haven't erased him from your life, do that now. After I did that, I got over him fairly quickly and realized how much of a abusive jerk he was to me. So anger also helped.. Not healthy though. I just try not to think of him as much as possible. 
2	[deleted]
1	What about when you're in a position where you want to break all contact but it's part of your really close friend circle?\nu/Smiles_are_powerful\nu/jennyjenjen4\nI don't want to lose all my close friends because I don't have a ton to begin with and they're all really good people even if I feel really upset around some of them.  I don't want to create any more drama.
3	Do you peeps relate to this?	
4	[deleted]
2	I don't have an amazing memory like the people in the article, but I do tend to tell more stories from my past than my friends do.
1	[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0-mv26szJk) a vid of some people talking about their experiences with it.
6	I'm making MBTI statistics and I need ISFJ input.	I'm making MBTI relationship statistics and I would like to do statistics of every type. But I don't have a lot responses of certain types, one of them is ISJF. This is why I'd like to ask you to fill out this form and contribute to these statistics.\n\n[Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19k9UrDFdQtci5-kRNeykkR3J4iw7c1A2y0zqirHQtoI) is the form.\n\nI really appreciate your help. If you are really interested in statistics, [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yFpUbw92VH_BGrVf-FMngyCdtERYVvvGOEL_T58kw9Q/edit#gid=641219863) is the sheet, (Check out other Tabs. It's also always updated.) It's currently unfinished, so pardon any bugs. And it's better to copy it to your google drive and edit INFP Tab from "INFP" in cell A3, to "ESFP" if you want to see your statistics. ESFP Tab is somewhat less finished due to Google Sheets bugs.
1	rip, I want to help out but I've already submitted a response  XD
5	I (INTJ) want to help close friend (ISFJ) with a lack of motivation	I (INTJ) recently had one of my friends take the MBTI after he expressed interest in personality types. Being roommates in college, we both are experiencing stress which would be common however, he is having problems with actually going to class which can easily become a big problem since he is currently on academic probation with the university. I want to know what I can do to assist with him getting the motivation to get up and not get kicked out.
2	Has he asked for help? 
4	Were/are any of you OBSESSED with figuring out your type?	My type means everything to me. It's my only concrete sense of who I am. I've spent hundreds of hours pouring over everything I can find about personality types, functions, etc. \n\nIt seems like there's a HUGE lack of ISFJs on here though and I'm curious about that.... Anyway, anyone else a MBTI addict?
3	I'm pretty driven in getting a definitive typing. Every online test I've done consistently says INFJ but I'm not sure. The INFP function stack seems to make more sense, but then I think about how Si resonates with me, so ISFJ could be on the cards too. My issue is that I find it hard to spot the functions in my own thinking. What I think is Ni-Fe could be Fi-Ne. \n\nI recently went to a psychologist to take the official MBTI (I'll get feedback on Wednesday.) - as soon as she said J and P is based on whether or not one is organized and structured I thought "shit, I've just wasted a lot of money." \n\nI also get differing typing from other users on here. Some say INFJ, some say INFP. So I feel your frustration. \n\nI don't know why my type is so important to me, I just feel that it's the first step in truly understanding myself.
3	I've been insanely obsessed by it, yeah, ha. I got very anxious over not having a definitive type - I thought I was an INFJ for about eight years, had a personality change following some trauma and starting thinking I was an ISTJ, then, after some mellowing, thought I was an INFP, but have become pretty certain I'm now an ISFJ. I have no idea if I was always an ISFJ or if I genuinely was an INFJ, because I'm definitely different now to how I was for all of my life prior to the incident. \n\nISFJs are definitely underrepresented online, and I reckon it's down to three main reasons:\n\n1. Many supposed-INFJs are actually ISFJs who have confused Si and Ni (easy as Si is so poorly described).\n2. It's understandable that sensors may well be less interested in MBTI unless they have a particular reason for being interested.\n3. ISFJs (and SJs in general) tend to be more practical/pragmatic and therefore probably have less time for faffing about with MBTI, ha. 
2	Yep, absolutely obsessed. Except at times, I felt incredibly talked down by some ISFJ descriptions on the web. I know I shouldn't believe in these generalisations, but still it hurts.. Sometimes makes me regret indulging in this whole personality thing.\n\n\nAs for your second statement, I believe it's because us ISFJs love doing the stuff we love rather than discuss stuff on reddit etc. You can see a big difference in activity between this sub and other MBTI subs, in particular the INFP or INFJ one 
19	Things I need to remind myself	Dear self,\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRemember that time you almost majored in the sciences because you spent too much time on Reddit and genuinely believed that STEM subjects were better than the arts *all the time forever and always?*  Yeah, you're kind of really impressionable and need to be more independent.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIgnore Myers Briggs stereotypes.  Before you knew about all this, you were sure you were an artist and a creative person.  You seriously don't need another voice telling you your artwork is worthless.  Creativity is independent of whether you're a sensor or intuitive, and you don't need someone to tell you that!  Sometimes people get obsessed with the idea that they're special by nature and sometimes people make huge, damaging generalizations on the internet.  Ignore this and remember that every single person is capable and wonderful.  Every experience and moment in life creates a wonderful flaky pastry of a human.  This is never not special.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt's ok to be reserved and keep your thoughts, feelings, and ideas to yourself.  You don't need to prove anything to anyone by sharing your innermost self in search of approval.  You already *are* wonderful and no one else gets to decide that.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGive yourself permission to get lost in your imagination, creating things!  You know you love the creative process, even if it can't get you a job... for now.  Maybe some day! \n\n&nbsp;\n\nStop thinking of how your crappy $10/hour job is a waste of time.  For now, it's a means to an end.  You even think spending time on the things you love is a waste of time and that's not a healthy mindset.
4	You are so right to look to yourself for self esteem, but I think the world is wrong too. \n\nThe anti sensor bias is real, and it just reinforces itself. Why think you are a sensor if you can reasonably deny it and hoard all the positive, creative adjectives to yourself? \n\nI remember a study that shows significant artistic emphasis in isfjs brain activity. I'll try to find it. \n\nAlso [this same painting by an infj and an isfj](https://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/3duemd/xpost_rinfj_my_so_and_i_just_went_to_one_of_those/). Someone in the comments outright can't believe isfjs can be artistic. Like, really? How do you even think all sensors must spend their time, sniffing rocks and cake baking? \n\nIn my opinion memory is so tied to feeling it can be categorized on so many interesting, creative axes. Smh
1	And don't forget it. Particularly the 'ignore the stereotypes' part. It's so easy to get caught up in that and use it as an excuse, but it doesn't mean that you can't do things that arent stereotypically ISFJ. Keep doing what YOU want. 
2	Enegram & Big 5 are not popular because there's nothing much to read about them in comparison to MBTI?	Why are "Enegram" & "Big 5" test not as popular as MBTI?\n\nI think it may be because there is a lot to read about your personality type online after taking a MBTI test but nothing much after taking the "Enegram" or "Big 5" test.\n\nWhat do you think?
4	Though I don't know much about the Big 5, Enneagram might be less popular than MBTI because it tends to have more negative descriptions of one's personality, rather than describing many of the positive characteristics of each personality type like MBTI descriptions tends to do more.\n\nBecause people would probably prefer to listen to positive comments about themselves rather than their flaws that remind them of their shortcomings, MBTI wins in popularity.\n\nThis is my guess, though I actually don't know for sure.
6	13 Question survery! MBTI & Music	Hi! This is for a research abut MBTI & Music, some of you have answered the simple test (only two questions) and I have received a lot of feedback telling me to do another less simple with more genres I listened to you guys and here it is! Thank you for your time I really appreciated also shout out to "ThePixelHunter" for helping me in this! \nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6AQZ7D2pA604k1OsTpQl_gd1d8ZvLeS4hcmasZjBzaMWWog/viewform
5	My ISFJ Boyfriend	So I have an ISFJ boyfriend. He is a fairly quiet person around people. He gets very anxious around strangers though. He really wants nothing to do with them. Not in a way that means that he wants harm to be brought onto them... he is just really shy and doesn't care enough to think about meeting new people.\n\nHe is a great guy - I have stress issues and no matter how much I need to vent or for someone to be there to speak some reality into me, he never gets fed up of it.   He is very protective of me, not in a possessive way either. He just really cares. The only time he gets unempathetic is understandable - when I'm grumpy out of nowhere and don't tell him why he gets a bit pissed off, but who wouldn't?\n\nOne thing though is that he gets grumpy quite a bit in general. Not because of me, he doesn't let it out on me either, but I can tell that stuff can really piss him off.\n\nBut yeah... any way I can cheer him up when he's grumpy? He seems to resort to punching stuff like a wall or something and that is not healthy. I had a talk with him, he says its because of extroverts trying to talk to him a lot. Thing is... his grumpiness lingers for a day or two. I have no idea on how to cheer him up. Any help?\n\nEDIT - I am an INFP
1	Does he do sport? It seems like he needs to blow off some steam, but since he isn't able to do it he keeps this pressure in him. Sport could help getting rid of it. The mental benefits of exercising are often forgotten since people only look to the physical health benefits of it. Could be really helpful, especially since you say that he gets grumpy quite a bit. Doesn't has to be the gym as people recommend 9 out of 10 times, but anything he might like, even going for a walk could be beneficial.\n\nIf he's really cropping up stuff there's probably not much you can do about it. You can get rid of it for a short period of time, but when he thinks back on it, the negativity is back immediately.\nTalking about it so he can vent out the feelings and then depending on what he like a hug, words of affirmation or things he really appreciates could help, but could also become a bit exhausting if it it happens a lot.
1	It sounds like he needs to have a de-stress/unwind/relax routine after dealing with extroverts or a lot of people.\n\nLike for when he gets home, he could adjust the environment to his liking (for me, it's putting on some music, mood lighting, incense or candles, comfort food/tea, keeping my place clean, showering or bath to clean myself and then reading, watching TV/movies or playing video games). \n\nI understand that it can be stressful dealing with other people, but once one has left that situation, how they feel is their responsibility. He should try to let it go and re-center himself. I think it is worthless to hold onto negative emotions when you could be experiencing a positive time. Definitely still let yourself feel, but acknowledge that those feelings are unproductive and try to bring in better feelings. 
1	This may be a bit silly with the considered answers here but I'm an ISFJ and do get grumpy. However it's more me being hangry than anything. Good sorts it out and makes me happy! \n\nProbably more of a personal thing than a personality trait. Maybe worth a go!

4	ISFJ vs INFJ Stereotypes--with my mother!	
1	Hello lovely ISFJs. This is a video of me and my mom. She doesn't know much about MBTI so we played a fun game where I put a bunch of stereotypes on slips of paper that she has to read and guess if they are associated with INFJ or ISFJ.  
13	Personality you show to loved/close ones vs ones you show to most people/aquitantances?	Generally as ISFJs we're only super loyal and open with people we've come to really trust otherwise we can be softspoken or more conservative with how we present ourselves.\n\nIf you don't mind sharing, what's the general personality you share with loved ones vs acquaintances?\n\nWith various acquiantances I'm usually pretty quiet/softspoken but I'll speak up if I feel like my input is important enough or doesn't cross anything someone else has already said. I generally try to keep the peace and do what I can so no one dislikes me.\n\nWith people I'm super close to (which isn't that many) I act really silly and sarcastic. I'll more openly talk about my personal feelings about things and people that I wouldn't dare bring up to most people.
10	Around strangers: confident and assertive, organised, calm, reserved but friendly. I can start up a conversation with pretty much anyone, and people tell me it really seems like I have my shit together.\n\nAround acquaintances/people I don't really know well yet but have to regularly spend time around: shy and anxious, either mostly silent or talking too much, watching everybody else almost warily. Apparently I give off a standoffish and overly intellectual air? \n\nAround casual friends: somewhere between 'strangers' and 'acquaintances', depending on the situation. The older the person is, I've found, the more comfortable I'll be around them; I'm twenty but I get on best with those over forty, and particularly well with those over seventy. \n\nAround immediate family and closest friends: goofy, enthusiastic and excitable, non-stop talking, paradoxically both meticulously organised and scatterbrained as hell, cynical and sarcastic at times. \n\nThe one exception to all of this is when children or animals are involved. That's when I get goofy, enthusiastic, and friendly, regardless of the situation - people who know me joke that Dad mode comes to the fore.  
3	Love how this thread has 10 upvotes and only 2 comments. I imagine everyone is silently nodding. :)
5	Can you tell me what you relate to in this post?	There's a huge tendency for ISFJs to identify as INFJs. I don't know if I'm that way or just very middle of the road. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/515xlw/infj_users_guide/\n\nI'd like to know what parts of this you identify with and which parts you can't relate to?\n\nThank you all so much for helping! :)
2	If I might add an additional question: Can you tell me what you relate to in [this "Things INFJs Say" post](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/50is2g/way_back_wednesday_shit_infjs_say_and_why/) (easily digestible top 20 list)?\n\nSomeone commented that "All people say stuff like this. You could even change the title to "Shit people say (and why)" which is far more holistically correct as a set of observations." So I looked at the old "Stuff We Say" posts for all the other types [(including ISFJs](https://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/1myiz5/things_isfjs_say/) and didn't see much overlap. \n\nSince y'all are doing an INFJ/ISFJ compare & contrast anyway, thought I'd ask!
1	[deleted]
1	What DOES APply\n-Do try to get as much sleep as possible\n-I do (Ti) analyze a lot and read into people and stuff\n-I like hugs and affirmation but dont always ask for it (fe)\n\nWhat does NOT Apply\n-Forgetting to eat. I love food so even when stressed I never forget to.\n-Sometimes I can think of consequences but I do have a tendency to act without thinking \n-Se occasional overeat/sleep. Im usually very specific of how I do these which I guess would be Si.\n-Hygeine: I ALWAYS brush my teeth and shower in the morning, no exceptions outside emergencies
1	I thought I was an INFJ for, what, eight years? So there's a fair bit I identify with:\n\n* able to think of any consequence of their action \n* sudden realisations \n* over-analyze the crap out of people, pay too much attention to insignificant detail and read too much into said detail\n* occasionally overeat\n* becoming emotionally cold when stressed\n* sitting in the corner of the room staring into the air for three days\n\nCan't relate to any of the things about sleep, hygiene, forgetting to eat, or the social awkwardness with strangers (I'm best with strangers, worse with acquaintances and casual friends). I absolutely never forget to eat, shower, or generally take care of myself, as I need to do all of those things to feel even vaguely human - and I need to do them in my particular routine and at my particular set times to feel 'okay' in myself.
5	Does anyone else hate taking care of people?	By taking care of people, I mean making sure they are comfortable in their immediate environment, i.e. making sure they are not hungry, making sure their feelings are not hurt. I find it extremely draining, and I'd rather be reading or learning or writing or doing something I actually enjoy. I also have the issue of not being able to engage in small talk, and I find that conversations about everyday life bore me. I'm ok with helping people with establishing their goals or giving them advice on personal issues, but I'm not good at the ritual of faking emotions to make people feel better. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThis has caused issues in my quest to try to form relationships with other people, especially with other females. For example, they'll be talking about something like a bad relationship, and they'll help the other person sort through their emotions, while I'll be sitting there quietly, wondering how and why people get into shitty relationships, the dynamics of a person who can't pick up on a crap person, and the like. I think I come across as too blunt and stoic or something, and people find it scary. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI guess I'm wondering if any other ISFJs have the issue of taking care of others. You know, the process of taking care of another person's mind. I feel like I have a hard time taking care of others. I think I use Fe because I like group harmony, and when everyone else is happy then I am happy. I don't know how competent I am in my use of Si; I think I'm an ISFJ who is neglecting it or simply does not know how to utilize it. I'm pretty good at coming up with insights about people and situations, so I guess I do use it? I just feel drained in conversations where people expect me nurture another person's emotions. I prefer to give people advice on how to handle their issues, albeit in a gentle manner, but other people seem to find it rude and unacceptable. Do any other ISFJs have this issue, where people are too much to handle, and you'd rather be reading or writing than dealing with other people. 
2	Um...not really? If I'm in a bad mood, I'll be cranky, cynical, and have little time for faffing around and people being ridiculous. My private thoughts about how they should get their shit together can sometimes bubble to the surface in those moments. Most of the time, however, I get a lot of satisfaction from ensuring that everybody's needs are met - it's as natural as breathing to check that people have eaten, that they're doing alright in themselves, checking in on any ongoing medical problems/injuries they're struggling with, asking if I can fetch them anything, and to stop and listen when people are having a rough time. Taking care of somebody/something puts me in a better frame of mind, and balances out my mood - it's why I find having pets and volunteering in helping roles to be so essential to my own well-being. \n
1	It depends, really. If I'm dealing with strangers, I'm much less likely to be warm and caring, and I feel awkward and strange trying to take care of them and make sure their needs are met.\n\nIf I'm with people I really love, though, then it doesn't drain me, it's how I express my care and concern for them. Then it feels completely natural, and I would do just about anything to make sure they're comfortable and content. \nAlso, downtrodden people. I have a soft spot for them. If I see an elderly person, a small child, a handicapped person, etc; struggling with something, my nurturing instinct takes over, and I just have to help them. \n\nEmotional care doesn't always come very naturally to me, though. I've always envied the ISFJs I've seen who can help people work through an emotional problem just by talking, because I always feel like I never know what to say, and I think I come across as cold and uncaring, when I feel the opposite. If it's somebody I'm really close to, it's not as big of an issue, but if it's just a casual friend or acquaintance, I don't know what to do, and the best I can manage is a pat on the back and a few generic, comforting words.
1	When it are people I care about: not at all. Only exhausting thing for me would be that if they would go through hard times that it hits me as well.\n\nIf I notice that they have issues and they got this wall between them and me and I don't notice any improvement in taking the wall down I'm gone though (the last part is difficult though, since I still care about them). I would like to help people, but if I can't get to know them it's only gonna damage me.\n\nI'm not a fan of small talk either though.
1	I do when I feel someone is just taking advantage of me. A lot of my job is IT support, so by 'taking care of', I mean fixing problems, showing someone how to do something, or just being a good teammate and helping out where I'm needed.\n\nI spend a lot of time answering the same questions over and over again, and eventually I get to the point of thinking "Come on, is it really that hard, or are you just that lazy?"\n\nI generally don't mind doing day-to-day things to keep the office in order - taking out the trash, emptying the dishwasher, reloading the printer, filing, making coffee, etc - but it gets under my skin when others in the office (at my level, not business owners) refuse to do those things and expect me to do them instead.  Just take a turn! You don't have to do it all the time.  Just show me the same respect I try to show you.
3	How do I care for my ISFJ and communicate my needs to my ISFJ effectively?	Hello my dear ISFJs. I am an ENFJ and my SO is an ISFJ. Not sure if this is important - age wise, we are more than a decade apart, him being the older one.\n\nI am writing to ask if 1) I am showing my SO enough appreciation and 2) how I can communicate my needs without hurting him.\n\nFirstly, my SO is the gentlest, most giving, and most loving soul I know. Loyal, intelligent, always The Eye of the storm. I love him to the ends of the world. He takes care of me in the littlest ways, which is a wonderful change because I am always the one who is taking care of people in my circle. I try my best to care for him in kind.\n\nHe travels overseas for work regularly, and I make it a point to show him more love and concern so he wouldn't feel lonely or homesick; I am always asking about his flight details so I can welcome him home no matter the time; I always encourage him to have fun while he's not working. I write little notes for him on little occasions, and I gift him with things he likes. I also thank him for every little thing he does for me.\n\n**Is there any other way I can improve? What am I missing out?**\n\nHere's the thing: I know he appreciates me, and I have told him that I understand that it is not easy for him to express his feelings (to which he nodded vigorously and sheepishly). I would NEVER push him to do what he is not comfortable doing.\n\nHowever...my love language is words of affirmations :'( I told him that multiple times. Today, he told me he was lonely until I found him, and I told him that I wish he would say that more often because sometimes I feel unimportant. He would tell me "if you weren't important I wouldn't xxx baby..." I don't even expect much - I don't need declarations of love, but I would appreciate more "I miss yous" and "I can't wait to see you", things like that.\n\nI feel like I'm holding back, a lot of the time. I want to shout to the world that I love him, but I don't want him to feel pressurised into saying it back. I told him that I care about him, and he would say that he knows, and give me kisses.\n\nThe fact that he travels a lot is an important point - for the last 12 years, he has been alone. I am the first girl he has opened his heart to, but I think his heart is still pretty guarded because one day he will leave for another country for work again and he wouldn't want me to go through all that pain. I think he has closed himself off to prevent himself from feeling all that hurt - of leaving his parents, his siblings, his nephews...\n\nMy approach is different - him and I, we probably have limited time together. I want it to be as transparent and as intimate as possible, and I don't care if it hurts when he goes. I just want him to know he is loved and cared for, and I feel so sad that he has to close his heart off to protect himself and the ones he love. \n\nI feel like a selfish bitch because he does allllll these things for me and logically I know he cares so much about me....yet I just NEED the verbal affirmations...yet I don't want to push him to do something he is not naturally comfortable with.\n\n**Help me, ISFJs... How do I broach this topic with him effectively?**
3	Bring it up gently, of course, and don't make it out to be something he's doing wrong, but rather something that would make you feel happy and loved. \n\nHave you talked to him about the love languages system? If you approached the topic that way, it could be your best bet. ISFJs tend to express our love through physical touch and acts of service, in my experience. Verbalizing our feelings can be extremely difficult for some of us, and it definitely doesn't come naturally for us.\n\nISFJs are generally very accommodating to our partners, and when we love someone, we'll be willing to bend over backwards to make sure they're happy in the relationship. You could start a discussion by asking him what you can do to make sure he feels loved, and see what happens. Odds are, he'll want to know what he can do for you, as well. \nJust be honest with him, and tell him that while you really appreciate all he does for you, and you know he loves you, it would make you really happy if he verbalized it once in a while. \n\nPersonally, I needed to have that pointed out to me, when I was young. My INFJ mother sat me down when I was about 11, and told me that people need to actually hear that you love them, sometimes, and while it was all very sweet that ISFJs will break their own necks in acts of service for other people, sometimes an "I love you, and you're special to me" can go a long way. It was sort of a wake-up call for me, because that hadn't even really occurred to me before then, until it was pointed out. It still doesn't come naturally to me, but I do try to push myself harder now to be verbal about my feelings for people.\n\n\nAs far as making him feel loved, the subtle gestures go a very long way. I recently started dating an ESFJ, and he has this way of taking care of things for me, and predicting my needs before I even know them, and it just makes me feel all warm and fuzzy on the inside. He can tell immediately when I'm feeling tired, and he starts packing up to take me home, without me having to say anything. If I'm cold, he puts his arm around me to warm me up, without me even having to mention it. I went to an all-day event with him on Saturday, and he made sure ahead of time that there were vegetarian food options at every location, so I wouldn't go hungry. The little gestures like that mean a whole lot to an ISFJ. We spend so much time trying to take care of everybody else all the time, it feels very nice to be taken care of by somebody else without even having to ask for it, once in a while. 
3	> I am always asking about his flight details so I can welcome him home no matter the time; I always encourage him to have fun while he's not working. I write little notes for him on little occasions, and I gift him with things he likes. I also thank him for every little thing he does for me.\n\nYou are already doing a very good job for showing an ISFJ appreciation. If I had a SO those things would mean the world to me.\n\nThe other topic is more difficult to me since I myself am quite open about my feelings. That you are saying that it means a lot to you the few moments that he speak words of affirmation is a good start. What Houndberry suggested about asking him first what he needs is a good idea. It's very likely that he will indeed return the question. A good way for him to learn it, although it may not be something that you could suggest, is if he makes a routine of it. Making it a routine is not the most romantic, but if he writes that he hopes to see you soon before he flies back, saying how he likes it to see you again when you pick him up (or welcome him at home) and that kind of things or even write in his agenda to say something of affirmation it will become easier for him to say it at other moments as well. Some things in life are scary or uncomfortable at the start, but after that it becomes a normal, but valuable skill for you.\n\nFor the approach of the time you have left together the only thing you can do is having an open conversation about it which you probably already had or tried to have.\n\nYou are not selfish from what you write. Good luck with it!\n\n
3	I have always felt weird telling someone that I love them. It always seemed  unneccesary to me. I would really do anything for my family and girlfriend, and I love them, but I never told them. But I would start doing that for sure if I knew that they need that. 
2	I think he's missing the point. I think he thinks your beef is about whether he loves you enough, and doesn't realise that you're actually talking about how you want him to SHOW it. So maybe emphasise that. And definitely tell him this part:\n\n> I don't even expect much - I don't need declarations of love, but I would appreciate more "I miss yous" and "I can't wait to see you", things like that.\n\nThis kind of feedback is super helpful for me because it's specific and also says that it doesn't have to be this huge, difficult/scary thing.\n\nGood luck! :)
2	Short MBTI Survey (2 Mins) [X-Post]	
3	Someone here watches Anime?	I just want to know the tastes of My brothers in type.\n\nI'm bored.
2	Series:\n\n* Angel Beats (mostly satire, but entertaining)\n* One Punch Man (satire again, but funny)\n* Kuruko no Basket (I love playing bball, so it's entertaining)\n* Psycho Pass (1st season is good, but not excellent)\n* Clannad and After Story (for those who like their heart strings pulled)\n* Code Geass (aboslutely love this one, but it's not for everyone)\n* Cowboy Bebop (if you enjoy episodial series)\n* Death Note (Epic beginner anime)\n* Fate/Zero (for those who like fighting/action anime)\n* FMA: Brotherhood (Pretty good intro to longer animes)\n* Haikyuu (biased because I love playing volleyball)\n* Kino's Journey (again episodial series)\n* Steins;Gate (if you like time travel/sci-fi)\n* Sword Art Online (1st season is pretty good, but tailors off heavily)\n* Hunter x Hunter (for those who like DBZ-type series)\n\n\nMovies:\n\n* The Girl who Jumped Through Time\n* Summer Wars\n* Studio Ghibli (really anything of theirs)
1	As I get older I have been watching it less moved away from anime series to anime movies. \n\nBesides all the Ghibli greats some nice movies are, The Boy and the Beast, Wolf Children, 5 Centimeters Per Second, and Garden of Words. \n\nAttack on Titan was the last good series I found.

8	IQ test with images only, stolen from intp sub, was fun to do	
3	Cool! Thanks for sharing :) \n\nI was getting pretty demoralized by the end. 
1	You go to Egypt
1	Dear god, I'm 150. There's no way.
3	What's your enneagram type?	I'm 4w5 and after Googling it it doesn't seem to be all that common for an ISFJ to be 4w5, but I definitely identify with both personality results quite well. 
1	I'm not sure what my results mean but here they are... maybe someone can help me understand this?\n\nType 9 - 10,\nType 1 - 3,\nType 8 - 2.7,\n\nWing 9w1 - 11.5,\nWing 9w8 - 11.4,\nWing 1w9 - 8,\nWing 8w9 - 7.7,\nWing 1w2 - 4.4,\nWing 8w7 - 3.7,
1	2w1
1	I'm type 9 iirc.  Steady and reliable.
1	I'm a 5w4. I sometimes test as a 5w6, but I usually test as a 5w4. 
1	I'm a 2w1. It seems pretty common for isfj's. 
1	I've never heard of the enneagram test before but I tested as 6w5. From reading the comments I'm guessing that is pretty uncommon for an ISFJ...?
1	Thought I was 1w2 for a while (also back when I thought I was an INFJ), these days I believe I'm a 6w5. 
1	6w7
5	Big fun Reddit MBTI survey	**Edit: I have closed the survey.** Basic preliminary data is available here: [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWpyBCtgq81S03KJZYVzn5tVVhUgbTcJ6lqUhDFb78EQQEtA/viewanalytics?usp=form_confirm)\n\nHi all. I'm interested in seeing what correlations exist between certain types and various random things, so I've created a big survey. Its a little bit long, it will probably take 10-30 min depending how fast you are at filling out surveys. I tried to mix fun questions with serious questions and so topics include pop culture, politics, art, lifestyle, etc.\n\nI also posted this in /r/mbti, but I'd like some more varied responses (INxx types really like filling out surveys) The survey is at [this link to google forms](https://goo.gl/forms/fHSemrg0ey1EYfK63)\n\nIt is completely anonymous, handled by google forms. After you take it it will let you see the raw results, please don't spoil these results for others. Once I have enough responses, I will perform a statistical analysis on the results and share them on /r/mbti.\n\nIf you know anyone else interested in MBTI, feel free to share the survey, but please only fill it out once yourself.\n\n**Please don't spoil** the survey questions for others, particularly the trivia questions, I want to see what types have knowledge/interest of certain things.\n\n*I'd like to know (without spoilers), what you thought of the survey and what additional questions you would have included. So please let me know.*
4	I wish the choices with 1,2,3,4 in agree and disagree would have a middle option for indifference. And I wish there would be less americanized questions, a bunch of them were stuff I had no clue about or which weren't applicable to me as an European.\n\nOtherwise an interesting survey.
3	INFJ wanting to help ISFJ friend!	Hi everyone!I'm an INFJ who has a good friend that is possible an ISFJ. He's going through some tough times and I was wondering what you guys appreciate hearing or wanting when you're going through something. What are the little things that make a difference when talking to someone? Also, how do you guys express if you like someone's company? I'm afraid that my INFJ-ness is a bit overwhelming as I like to ask deep questions, do you ISFJ's hate that?\n\nThanks in advance! Sorry for the overload of questions haha
6	For me personally, I will usually not volunteer much (if any) information unless the other person takes an active interest and asks those deep/tough questions. I really love deep conversations, but I am HORRIBLE at starting them, so I definitely appreciate people who have a knack for that. However, if you are not one of my "people," my select few, I am likely to deflect those questions in an attempt to get the focus of the conversation off of me. So basically a lot will depend on how close you two are. \n\nAnd as far as "the little things that make a difference" -- listen, tell them that you care, and NEVER invalidate their feelings (we do that enough inside our own heads). 
4	Not a fan of being asked deep questions and feeling like I need to have a specific answer... I use a lot of "I don't know, why don't you google it?" bc google is smarter than me.\n\nFor me, I just want to know someone cares about me and is thinking about me. Texts like "Hi, I just wanted to say I love you and hope you have a good day!" or "Hi, I thought about you when I saw this :)"\n\nI like reassurance a lot as well. If I'm feeling down I'm usually being very harsh on myself so I want someone to say, "You know, I just want to tell you what a wonderful friend you are to have! You mean so much to me." Because honestly knowing other people are happy with me makes me feel better.\n\nJust be there and let them *know* you are there. I have a lot of trouble asking for help, but if it is offered to me I might accept it... I won't ask for a lifevest to be thrown to me but if I see one nearby I might try it on of that makes sense.
3	It depends on person to person, but let them just pour out everything if they feel comfortable. As an ISFJ myself, I tend to keep all of my problems to myself and when it's too much it gets bad. Basically just talking it out should help alot. Of course depends on your relationship and how open they are. Let them talk, don't try to expand on their thoughts but let them do it instead. 
2	Hug him. Not an ISFJ but hugs are nice for everyone.
1	I would say that you should absolutely use your INFJ strengths to help your friend. \n\nI have a very close INFJ friend that I can always talk to whenever I'm going through something tough, and it always offers me new insights that I have a lot of trouble coming to on my own. I find that I often get stuck in these loops when I'm trying to resolve my own personal conflicts and INFJs seem to be able to work past these. It needs to be done lovingly enough, as exposing myself that much can leave me feeling very vulnerable. If your friend really does open up to you, then they have an immense trust. If you violate that they will not forget. They might be able to get over it on the surface and it might seem like it has disappeared, but they very likely won't share that type of information with you anymore. \n
6	ISFJs playfulness in the bedroom…	After reading a few relationship section of ISFJs online how accurate does it describe you? Do you put your SO desires before your own? How open are you to try new things even if it makes you uncomfortable? Does your shyness carry over? \n
5	Yes, highly value pleasing my partner. I used to do things that made me uncomfortable just to please my partners but have finally quit that (still compromise of course but wouldn't do anything I really don't want to do like I did in past).\n\nMy shyness does carry over at times *but* after being in a long-term relationship with my current boyfriend that is not an issue.\n\nI also am pretty exhibitionist, doing things on cam and posting pics etc. Pretty sure this is actually due to my desire to please others -- I can please a lot of guys by camming/pics which in turn arouses me.\n\nI normally post here on my alt account but since this is a sex-related question, why not use my main? Lol
4	[deleted]
3	INTP here so can't speak from personal experience. But from some research I find that that could definitely be the case. With Fe being the second function in play ISFJs gain a sense of pleasure in helping others. (Can be related to sex as well I'm sure.) Si being the primary function. As an introverted sensor(Si) practical traditions that make sense to to the individual play a huge role in basically any interaction with them. So add in practiced extraverted feeling (Fe) as that second function, and I'd imagine it would just be second nature to put others before themselves.\n\nThere will always be exceptions to this of course depending on life experience and maturity. But id say in general ISFJs will be fairly selfless people. Though deep down I think it might be a slightly selfish action (not in a bad way.) but I feel like the personal satisfaction they get out of helping people makes it so worth it to them. So maybe not selfish but a fair balance at least 
3	I wouldn't say my shyness carries over because there is nothing I am shy about in my relationship with my husband.\n\nI'm willing to try anything once as long as it doesn't involve adding another person to the mix. My SO's desires don't come before or after my own desires. As long as both of us are having fun, then both of us are getting taken care of (if you know what I mean).
5	I wouldn't count on too many ISFJs replying to this.\nIn my experience, we're all a little uptight about sharing intimate details like this with strangers.
10	Does anyone here like things that spin? Things like spinning chairs.	Etc.
4	It's almost an obsession
2	I tried to get good at pencil-twirling but never got that good at it... maybe I should try again.
2	Who doesn't ?\n\n¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nIt's mesmerizing.\n\nIt reminds me [videos with gyroscopes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbdrqpXb-fY) I've seen on Youtube.\n\n---\n\nAlso, I'm an ENTP. So …\n\n---\n\nOn a side note, can the mods here pull up the flairs ? It will prevent me to state my type every time I post here, which is good for my natural laziness. \*Wink wink*

6	ISFJ should try on the nomad life?	We shouldn't just have an immobile haven. We should be able to take our tastes and intricacies with us, wherever we are. Also, I know it's not advantageous, but you just have to look for your needs.
7	Can ISFJs be moody?	
3	Why not ?\n\nAnyway, I think Si doms strive in stability, so mood swings may appear only on dire context.\n\nAll the alpha quadrant seem pretty emotionally stable, to me.
2	I'm an ISFJ and feel I'm moody. And it doesn't seem to fit the bill. When I miss things I suddenly become saddened, like I'll never see it again. But I try to re-assure myself by saying I'll miss a lot of things, and be happy with what you see, hear, etc.\nBut then again, I could just be an unhealthy ISFJ
1	I have a tendency to be moody as an ISFJ, but then I started taking a DBT class, and I've learned how to regulate my emotions much better, it's fantastic. 
1	Yup.
1	My boyfriend is an ISFJ. He can be grumpy a lot (not really "moody") but that's because of extroverts usually. I understand him though as I am also an introvert. They can be annoying.
1	I think for the most part, I'm only moody if I'm going through some kind of crisis. In which case, I'm basically an emotional wreck, and I pity anybody who has to be near me. \n\nBut that's really only happened a couple times in my life so far, and the circumstances have to be pretty bad for me to end up like that.
5	Any fellow ISFJs out there who are self-employed and love what you're doing?	Please share your experience. I'd like to quit my day job and start my own business. But as you know, ISFJs need to have a detailed plan before we feel comfortable taking any action. Thanks in advance!
1	I had been a self-employed system administrator before I decided to join grad school. The flexibility and the money was amazing.
1	Indeed. The only job I've had is online. I really do prefer to work on my own schedule, in my own environment and have control over everything. Quitting your day job should be done after you have something already established and making money consistently. \nI don't think I can really offer much advice as it's not so much of a business that I run, different areas. \nBest advice is, keep your day job until you can for sure make enough to support yourself. Don't rush and try not to strain or stress yourself too much.
7	Does anyone else hate who they are?	Because I do. I hate my personality type, and I hate who I am as a person. I hate that I can't "live in the moment". I'm always thinking about the future. I feel as though I have no connection to my body. It's just kind of there. I'm not good at anything I try. I'm thinking of just giving up on any educational pursuits and marrying an abusive man because I deserve to get physically abused after grief I've given to other people. I'm stupid. I hate myself. 
8	Coming from an ISFJ who's struggled with anxiety and depression, I get the thoughts you're having. You are not alone. I have a few thoughts that have comforted me that I hope will comfort you:\n\n- You are so unique. There is no one on this planet exactly like you. You have the ability to impact people around you like no one else - literally no one else in the world - can. You matter. You are precious. You are who you are for a reason. Don't hate yourself for being who you are.\n- The world needs people who can plan and think about the future. Sure, there's a balance between the extremes of recklessness and extreme constant planning that everyone can reach - but it's okay to be more on the planning end of the spectrum. As long as it's not obsessive or anxiety-driven, it's good to think ahead! It's good to be realistic and think about consequences of your actions and to be careful about your future. That's a good thing.\n- I used to feel very out of touch with my body, too, until I started listening to it. Pay attention to the little things it does when you try a new food or go for a jog. You'll be amazed what you can pick up when you really look for what your body is telling you.\n- You do NOT deserve abuse. Ever. Period. You are a unique human being with a valuable life and you matter. You. Matter. No amount of perceived grief you've given others or past mistakes or ANYTHING make you deserving of being abused. You don't deserve an abusive relationship. You are far, far too valuable for that.\n- For me, it's easy to overthink about how other people perceive me and how much of a burden I am to them. I can tend to microanalyze every encounter and conversation and text message and build up how I perceive someone thinks about me - and that's not healthy. And 99% of the time I'm wrong. You are probably MUCH less of a burden than you think. And your value doesn't depend on what other people think of you anyway.\n\nI hope this helps. I really do. I hope you find peace in who you are and how your brain works. Please feel free to PM me anytime. I mean that. I'll talk to you about anything. Know that I'm praying for you.
3	Meditation can help you live in the moment. It will be a few weeks practice till you understand what I actually mean about this.\nIt'll make you also hyper aware of your thoughts. Sometimes I realise my brain is stupid while I meditate like why is my brain thinking of this bs that is so pointless etc. give it a go I suggest

2	Dudes or Dudettes?	Hey guys, new ISFJ here. Just joined. Saw online that there was a fairly large percentage of ISFJ's were female - I'm a guy. Just curious, how many lurkers here are guys? I find that most guys I know fall more as thinkers or intellectuals rather than protectors.
2	Guy isfj here checking in. I know of one other isfj guy IRL. Every other one is female.
2	[deleted]
1	I am a guy. \n\nI try to be logical when I can but When it comes to bigger/snap decisions Ill generally lean on Si/Fe
1	There are more guys on Reddit than girls, so this might make up for it. I think on Reddit it's around 60-70% guys and around 30-40% girls, but I can't remember the exact numbers
1	Male ISFJ here. I've never known many ISFJs in general (I am surrounded by mostly NTs and at times it's not very pleasant because of the fact that NTs and FJs are complete opposites), but the one or two I have known have been female, so welcome to the minority man. It's all good though. We're a good minority!
1	I'm a female ISFJ. I don't think I've ever met a male ISFJ (at least that I know of, I'm not the kind of person to bring up MB to everyone I meet) so it's funny you would say that OP.
1	INTJ checking in to give info. My brother is a clear ISFJ but I do know several girls who are clearly ISFJ as well.
1	Guysfj here.\n
1	I, myself, am an ESTP. Two of my greatest friends are ISFJ, who are both male as well. However, I know that about two thirds of ISFJ are female... but that doesn't mean much :)
1	Also guy. Though I don't know if I know another male ISFJ. 
1	This is an old post but male ISFJ here.
15	In your guys' own words what do you think are the best (and worst) aspects of a being an ISFJ?	Imo the best things about being an ISFJ are that we have a mix of being practical and people oriented. I like the humility we have. And the great loyalty. And just general stability.\n\nUnfortunatley there is a problem of not saying No when we need to. Thinking of the big picture and taking more initiative can be a problem too.
8	ISFJs care deeply about other people, which is a great quality that leads to our altruistic nature and our desire to work at things that practically and sustainably help others.\n\nHowever, I feel like we can care a little too much, which can lead to anxiety/depression. (I was diagnosed with GAD within the past year and my counselor told me, "I don't think you need medication, I think you just need to learn to care a little less." Lol.) There's a balance between caring about/helping others and recognizing that you can't solve everything - in fact, by trying to solve all of someone else's problems, you might be hurting them in the long run by depriving them of a lesson they need to learn themselves (always helpful for me to remember).\n\nAt least, that's been my experience as an ISFJ.
3	The ISFJ is very simple on the outside. We care deeply, deeply for others, and love to feel appreciated for doing so. Another positive has been my memory and practicality, in both the workplace, and in high-intensity situations. I'm somehow always able to keep my composure in times of turmoil. \n\nOn the flip side, I'm only good when thinking/acting on my feet. Forget about planning for the future, I can't even plan how my next day will be. Another downside is our intuition; personally I overthink situations in a billion different directions, until I'm crippled from thinking too much about what may, or may not come to fruition. \n\nHope this was useful, fellow ISFJ's :) 
2	I'm confused about the "people oriented" part. When people act like idiots I have no problem with not giving a dam about them. But when I see people suffering whether by sickness, or abuse, or by injustice I am overwhelmed with empathy to the point of depression. \n\nI definitely have "big picture" issues. I don't see it at all. :-/\n\nSaying the word "no" has been the bane of my existence.
1	How can you keep thinking of the big picture and yet be unable to say no when it is needed? \n\nI find it contradictory, and thus can not derive any meaning for it isn't expanded upon here. Unless you're fine with these contradictions, or there is some flaw in your beliefs, in which case the second statement is the conclusion of itself and of the first statement. 
1	Putting others before myself, Goes in both categories i suppose.\nAs well as Door slamming, Being able to cut someone out of your life without a second thought is nice. But also awful trying to open the door back up to people you may want a relationship with, or feel you should not have door slammed.\nHaving the ability to just well, sit in peace with my thoughts without the need for social interaction. It's nice here and there though.
11	Ne, help it grow?	Anyone have any advice on developing our inferior extroverted intuition? 
2	I wouldn't try to develop it at all.  Maybe spend a little time in conversation with an Ne primary or secondary.  Maybe spend a little time drawing up abstract gardening designs or writing poetry.  But from what I've read it's best to focus on your strengths and mitigate the damage caused by your inferior.  Often this damage is caused by obsession with what you think you want (inferior), and what you're best at; how you perceive primarily.  
2	I have an Ni-inferior, as opposed to an Ne-inferior, but the best advice I could probably give you is don't even worry about it.\n\nYour inferior is unconscious, and it's already pretty happy there! Just focus on your Si-Fe, and use Ti when you're in the mood to relax. The routine will soothe you, and when you're in the flow of it you will have the opportunity to catch glimpses of your iNtuition. 
2	I can help you with that! Take a look at /r/ENTP sometime and get a whiff of the crazy!
12	How do you avoid being taken advantage of?	I am constantly taken advantage of by friends, family, and work.\n\nMy biggest issue right now is with my parents who are going through a messy divorce. I have pleaded with them to communicate with each other but they always fall back to using me as a messenger. My therapist tells me to push back but it's like they know I will eventually give in, so they just keep asking me to do things because they know I'm a good kid and will do it.\n\nWith work, I am stuck on a project from hell and I am not even getting paid. I asked my dad (boss) to pay me but he says because I'm a contractor, and the client isn't paying his company, that's not how it works. We're doing work for free for this guy because we don't want to burn any bridges and if he's successful he might have more paid work for us down the line. But it's too stressful for me to work on a project that's always up in flames and having to do damage control.\n\nFriends-wise I have one I'm very close to but it's so clear he's taking advantage of me and I'm in some crappy codependency loop where I wait for him to screw up on drug/alcohol binges then accept every apology he gives me.\n\nThis is more of a rant I guess. You know how we bottle up our emotions? I feel like I'm at that breaking point and want to run away from my life and cut off contact with everyone for my own sanity.\n\nWhat strategies have you used to avoid getting into situations like these? Especially when you try to have a serious conversation (e.g. my parents) but it seems like the points you try to make are ignored because everyone is used to you giving in?
4	Sometimes you do need to take time for yourself to reflect, so your decisions are not influenced by guilt or irrational emotions. If you know it's a unhealthy co-dependant friendship, or that you are clearly being taken advantage of you need to weight out the negatives and positives and cut ties for your own good if that is what you think is the best solution.\n\nI find it hard to give up on people but sometimes you are just not healthy for each other. Only because you were compatible once doesn't mean this is the case now, people hold on to a state of permanency but it's not realistic.   \n\nI know ISFJ are known for being altruistic, but sometimes you need to be selfish for your own sanity. We can't help everyone. Mindfulness has helped me deal with reflecting a lot. \n\nhttps://www.livingwell.org.au/mindfulness-exercises-3/\n
3	I used to have this exact same problem, then I started taking DBT therapy, it's amazing for ISFJs. The Dear Man technique changed my fucking life, I seriously use it all the time. http://www.dbtselfhelp.com/html/ie_handout_8.html
2	Wow, that's a lot to deal with at once. Rough deal. :(\n\nHere's the thing: they don't keep asking you to do things because you are a good kid. They're asking you to do these things because they're bad parents.\n\nYou're working three jobs right now. One as a mediator for your parent's divorce, a service which can be valued as high as several hundred dollars per half-hour. The second is this contracting job, which you already realise is a scam. (And yes. If you are not getting paid, that is exactly what's happening.) \n\nThe third, insidious job you have is the one keeping you trapped in the other two: the role of the "good kid". The value of what is lost performing this role cannot be measured in currency. \n\nYou need to decide what you are worth. 
26	Anyone else overthink almost everything and try to plan for/figure out the future as much as possible?	
14	Yes and no. I over think everything and plan nothing. 
11	[deleted]
6	Yeah! I hate surprises, I need to know exactly what's going to happen.
4	I think I speak for most ISFJs in saying that we all think about the future but it is an endless cloud of possibilities, which indefinitely clouds our judgement of the future. \n\nIf someone asks me, "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?" all I can think to reply with is , "I don't know." Grey areas are so tough for us because we are mostly grounded in the concrete world. I live in the moment and have little concept of decision making developing down the road. 
4	Yes. I plan everything and get all hyped up about it, get tired, go to bed, wake up having forgotten or stopped caring. Repeat a few weeks later. 
3	Yep. Tends to lead me to being super indecisive.
3	Yes, I overthink but I've been able to stop myself when need be. I love to plan and write lists but I'm okay with surprises, most of the time. If I could plan what career path I'm suppose to follow that would be great at my elder age.
2	YES. YES. "If you fail to plan, you're planning to fail" is essentially my mantra. And feeling like the future is out of my control is a nightmare. Haha.
3	Where could I find one of you?	ISTP here.\n\nRight now I have found myself in another new country and I don't really know anybody, and meeting people is not my speciality as I don't really know how to small-chat. But this time instead of playing dota and giving up on meeting people I would like to try something different.\n\nAs I usually get very well with xSFJ people. Where can I met one of you and how? 
8	[deleted]
1	Hello first post. You could find me volunteering and talking up a storm about what we're passionately volunteering for, usually animals or helping people fallen on hard times.
1	You can find me in Azeroth or running at the park if I'm not there then I'm at work taking care of my residents at an ALF :D 
2	Meet Evan, the ISFJ! (me)	
2	I thought that I am not real ISFJ for wanting appreciation sometimes, but now I see that it's normal. Thanks!
0	How about pranking the main sub ?	I wonder how to pass as an ISFJ, when I'm an ENTP.\nCan y'all give me pointers to make my impersonation as convincing as possible ?\n\nOn a side note : it's mostly a pretext to ask y'all about your ISFJness, out of curiosity. I'm not sure I'll be able to pass as my complete opposite.\n\nI can make a rather correct INFP impersonation, though.
33	[deleted]
9	I don't think it's a clever idea. Just seems like it would be annoying. It also seems like just a way to get attention on yourself, and that also kinda of annoys me.
10	Bottle all your emotions until you explode and ruin all your positive relationships. 👍🏻😀
3	I suggest you read the isfj description and then do the opposite.
2	Hey, are you that entp that made a post on /r/infj to call infjs shifty because they didn't talk about their minds in a non-abstract way? You have a similar writing style- not sure if that's an entp thing or a you thing. 
2	Alright! Let's hear your INFP impression sir!!!! \n\n*popcorn and deck chair out*
5	ISTJ or ISFJ?	Hello friends, ENFP here. I have a friend who I can't type perfectly.\nWhat's the main differences between you two? Maybe you can help me out, I'll tell you a bit about him. He doesn't show what he really feels when he's sad or upset, but I can tell. He still won't tell if I ask him. He always thinks of what's logical, yet he is very very considerate of the people he cares about. He measures his words. He also is very afraid of confrontation, and would avoid it even more than myself. I don't know, if I can think of anything else I'll tell you. Thanks in advance
4	Main difference will be Te vs Fe. \n\nTe prioritizes logical execution of external tasks. It gets shit done. \n\nFe prioritizes doing what Si (the worldview function) deems as best for the group. It is an accommodating and harmonious function. \n\nIn other words, ask yourself if he prioritizes being in harmony with those around him (Fe- ISFJ) VS.  getting stuff done (Te-ISTJ). \n\nFrom your description, sounds like ISFJ. 
9	Being considerate can be a bad thing in a relationship	Hey fellow ISFJ'ers \n\nI am having trouble in my relationship as I am too considerate and a pushover. I am currently dating  Anyone ENTP male.\n\nMy bf says that I can't make up my mind and with that, it makes it hard for him to plan things because I tend to change my mind a lot because I worry about what his needs are too much. \n\nAnyone else have this issue? How dod you go about stopping yourself from being too nice and being more assertive?
6	not an isfj, but this isn't actually being considerate. :-)\n\ntheres a difference in taking someone's needs into consideration and making decisions for other people based on what you think their needs are.\n\nYou choose for you, let him choose for him. Us guys generally like partners who know what they want. :-)
2	For me it has come with time and in trusting my boyfriend that he will be honest if he truly doesn't want to do something. If I know I can believe him I don't need to second-guess if he is upset or unhappy because he has agreed to tell me if he feels that way.\n\nThis means if your boyfriend and you have a plan to go out then believe that he wants to be spending that time with you. Don't worry "oh no what if he'd rather be doing something else." And like I said I have struggled with this but as you continue your relationship you should feel more and more comfortable being open and honest with your SO.\n\nIn the beginning I hardly ever asked for small favors etc but now I ask him to do small things for me a lot like make me coffee or go to the grocery store with me. I am 23 and have been with him for 2.5 years for reference. When I was 19 and in my first relationship I was way more of a doormat than I am now.
1	I'm male, and I'm ISFJ. \n\nWhat I normally do in situations where we're trying to decide is frame in in a "My preference would be to do ______" but that doesn't necessarily mean that you're not open to other things. You don't even really need to be assertive, just make it clear what your preference is. I always find it frustrating when people leave decisions up to me because I want what's best for everyone, but if nobody is offering opinions then I'm free to decide. Let him know what your actual preference is. I know that you want what's best for him, but he's trying to take you into account as well, so you've gotta give him something to work with. 
16	How to love you?	I will start off with that I am ENTP. My girlfriend is ISFJ. We have been dating for over a year. I just feel like we have a lot of the same recurring problems and I don't know why she puts up with me. I don't believe she has any positive gain from me. She is an endless bubbly fountain of love, support, and happiness and I always seem to hurt her feelings when I don't intend to. I ask her so many questions about how to be better and she say's she wouldn't want to change me but is it worth it if all I ever do is hurt her? It just doesn't quite seem fair. She is very emotional and I recognize I have emotions, I just don't know what to do with them. I guess I don't really know how to love you guys. I would like to learn how to better for her. Any help would be greatly appreciated. \n\n\nEDIT: Thank you for helping me! You are all so nice. As an ENTP being the subject of all this caring and niceness really can freak me out.
7	For me, I really need someone I can tell *anything* to -- and this won't develop right away because it takes a long time for me to open up. I have so few deep friendships but the ones I do have ground me and keep me sane. I also am pretty picky about the people I even "select" to try and be friends with... I think while ISFJs are very nice and want to help others we are also at the same time reserved and private about our own problems and life.\n\nFor me, my boyfriend is the person I can ask, "Am I too crazy for thinking this?" or "Should I feel guilty over x or was it not really my fault even though I'm blaming myself?" etc (of course we have a lot of loving moments blah blah but my point is he is my sanity sounding board). It might sound silly but that is what I need -- a person who I can tell anything to and not feel judged or stupid.\n\nI also have been in bad relationships before where my emotions were largely invalidated and ignored. My current SO is very supportive of my emotions and always tells me it is okay to feel how I feel. And sometimes I randomly kind of snap (pretty stressed lately) but I immediately feel bad and ask "can we just pretend that never happened" and we do.\n\nAlso I really want someone who *wants* to do small simple things for me just to make me happy -- and without me having to ask for. If I ask for you to go to the plant stire with me and pick out something to grow then I'd want my SO to *want* to go and not sound sad or upset or even slightly grimace because any small sign of annoyance and I immediately feel guilty for asking whatever I asked and will repeatedly say "nevermimd, I can do that on my own!"\n\nHope this helps and best of luck to you and your girlfriend.
3	I was with an INTP for a while, so that sounds pretty similar to what our situation was like.\n\n\nThe thing about ISFJs, or at least in my case, is that we can get offended relatively easily, but we also generally get over it pretty fast. If my feelings were hurt over something, and I brought it up, as soon as I got an apology or an acknowledgement that it wasn't intentional, and they didn't mean to hurt my feelings, I'm so over it. \n\n\nCommunication is really going to be your best bet, here, for both parties. I learned very quickly that I had to be extremely upfront and direct with an xNTP, and they don't pick up on subtle cues or hints, which was okay with me, but it took some getting used to. ISFJs can also be somewhat needy when it comes to affection, and it's easy to feel a little neglected if we aren't getting enough.\n\n\nIt can feel very strange to have to remind your partner that you'd like a little more love and affection, because it just comes really naturally to us, and we can be super gushy people, but honestly, it's really the most effective solution. I was prone to feeling unloved or neglected by my INTP, when he was really just doing his own thing, and he was distracted, it wasn't that he didn't love me. He just didn't show it as often, or in the same ways I did. \n\n\nDo you have any specific examples of when/how you've unintentionally hurt her feelings?\nI could probably give more tailored advice, if you do. \n\n\nEmotional stuff just isn't going to come as naturally to you as it does to her, and it's unrealistic for her to expect that from you. But that being said, we're very affectionate people with our mates, and little gestures of love and affection can go a very long way in keeping things running smoothly.
2	Have either of you come across this test, I found it to be useful in trying to understand how different people show they care.  http://www.5lovelanguages.com/profile/ 
1	[deleted]
1	Props for you to seek out assistance! That says a ton about your commitment. In my ISFJ-ISFJ relationship, the communication is really key. Sounds to me like it might benefit you both if she actually let you know how you can improve in the relationship. Maybe you can try to communicate that you just want to understand her better and grow the relationship, and it's not about changing who you are as a person. I know personally I tend to be very observant, and my observations tend to be accurate, but sometimes I assume too much and get myself in trouble for it. That's why I've found clear communication to really help make sure that I'm not reading too much into things. \n\nJumbled advice, but I hope it helps. Best of luck to you!!
2	Being Sick	INTP here\n\nWhat the f@&$ do you want? :)\n\nI'm talking about inconvenient illness like colds or stomach bugs.\n\nMy reaction is always logical. When faced with x, y and z well often help you feel better and recover. When I try this with someone who is isfj, it seems to upset them. \n\nI think they just want to be hugged for 48 hrs until it passes?
3	I always want to be left alone! It's nice to be there if I reach out, but being sick stresses me out and I like to just lay in bed in my misery alone.... Most other things are overbearing. 
4	When I am sick I want someone else to handle my basic needs. Making soup and bringing it to me in bed, making tea and drinking a cup with me, bring me any book I ask for, etc. (This is directed at my boyfriend at least)\n\nWhen I was sick in the hospital and younger though, I didn't want many people around. My family was very upset I did not want anyone spending the night in the hospital with me and I was upset they kept insisting on not leaving me alone.\n\nFor the most part though, I just want to be entertained and not move around much. If my boyfriend seemed very robotic in stating: "You have x condition. I will get you y and z for your pain. These will help because of their x properties," I would be kind of upset... I want him to sound *concerned* about my health and not just like my doctor.\n\nMy mom and boyfriend are both INTJs and they have a very distinct "business" tone and I hate when it's directed at me, only because I always see it used on strangers. So it sounds stupid, but it can also be the tone of how you're saying things that is upsetting. For me, I *hear* the tone of how things are said almost more than what is being said -- a neutral/nice thing said in a rather cold tone immediately makes me think "Oh no, are they mad at me?"
3	My ISFJ mom...	INFP here requesting help with ISFJ mother...\n\nMy mom tries... HARD. But she has a number of shortcomings that have been difficult to ignore as of late. \n\nFor instance:\n\n-She will work herself to the bone and spread herself so thin that she barely takes any time for herself. And on top of that, she never asks for help! \n\n-If nobody offers her help or foresees her needs, she gets very upset. \n\n-She places blame on others even when she is at fault herself. \n\n-She is paranoid, quick to defensiveness, and suspects that people are talking negatively about her when, in fact, they are not.\n\n-She is often in denial about issues in the house (for instance, the dogs keep going to the bathroom in the front room creating an awful smell and ruining the carpet) and things are very cluttered\n\n-She is paranoid about her food habits. She pretends like she eats Keto but then turns around and eats rice or bread or something, but is like legitimately afraid of carbs. She tortures herself over food!\n\n-She complains all the time. About food allergies or general aches and ailments. But she NEVER DOES ANYTHING ABOUT IT. She would even offer to share a dish with you that she might have a negative reaction to, unless you realize what is happening and change your mind about what you want.\n\n-She goes to church and is a deacon, even though she complains about going all the time? She victimizes herself over church all the time as if she's Jesus Christ or something.\n\n-She is oblivious to the world around her. She is addicted to stupid phone games. She runs into people at the grocery store.\n\n\nOkay, so this has been quite venty. I'm aware that these issues might not necessarily be ISFJ things, but more individual problems. And I haven't mentioned how loving and dedicated she is to her family. She is very well-meaning so it's hard to get mad at her. But, I'm asking you ISFJ folk, how do I get through to her with the self-victimization and the repression and the retreating from reality?\n\nEdit: After some thought, I think I should add... My ISTJ father does NOT give her the kind of support she needs. So a lot of these problems may stem from marital stress...
3	Oh wow. Yeah. I can see some isfj traits but it sounds much more like there's an underlying mental/emotional health issue going on here. And the non-supportive family isn't doing much for her either. It's apparent in the lack of spousal support that there's a marital breakdown. You can't do much about that. That's between the two of them. But I mean, you clearly can see that your mom needs help. Don't wait for her to ask you to help her. Did it ever occur to you that at some point she got tired of cleaning up after the dog and just said f' it! If no one else cares about cleaning up the dog piss why should she? But seriously, she sounds exactly like someone else's mother I know. She hasn't seen a doctor, a dentist, or an optometrist in years. I'm certain she can't see yet she continues to drive a car. She talks smack about people in the room under her breath yet loud enough for others to hear then pretends like she didn't say anything. I have no idea what type she is but at this point I believe it's irrelevant. She's clearly dealing with some form of mental illness but her family ignores it or puts up with it. I'm not sure which is worse. If you all continue to allow her to continue this type of behavior it will only get worse. I'm no doctor but if what you say is true regarding her behavior she sounds like she needs to see a doctor. It's definitely not normal isfj either. I wish you and your mom best regards.
1	What kind of support do you think your father should be giving her?
1	Despite all the chaos around you, you sound quite grounded. That's a definite plus. Kudos to you! I hope your siblings are equally grounded. Best regards to all of you. :-)
1	I see a lot of these traits in myself -- but I am also depressed. I'm hoping that with therapy and medication I'll get better.\n\nSounds like she is really embodying all the *worst* parts of being an ISFJ and not reaping many of the rewards...\n\nI think honestly you should try to be gentle with her right now. I cannot imagine the guilt she must be under -- because trust me she knows that the house is not as clean as it should be, etc. But sometimes you just get into a mindset of "Where do I even start, it's pointless, I'd rather just keep distracting myself..."\n\nMaybe you can offer a way of tackling problems together. You say she does not ask for help and spreads herself too thin; I think a great way to help and motivate her would be to offer to tackle a problem *together*. "Mom, I think if we both tackled cleaning the kitchen counter it would only take 15 minutes. I'll grab some clorox wipes and why don't you start from that end and I'll start from this end?" Do you have siblings? You can also get them involved.\n\nI think she is probably really overwhelmed and just does not know how to express it. It's honestly how I have been feeling lately but again I at least am in therapy and on medication now and it has been helping some.\n\nBest of luck to you and your mom. Please try to help her out if you can, it means *a lot* to me when people do small things for me and your mom might be the same. Even just a "Mom, I love you and I hope you had a good day" when you walk through the door after getting home or something.
7	Fellow ISFJ - how did you meet your SO?	How did you end up meeting your significant other? and what is their type?
2	I met my intp bf through a mutual friend at a Christmas party and even though we had a weird month where he broke up with me way back in March we love each other so much
2	We were in college, my roommate was dating one of his friends. Our friend groups merged and hung out watching movies on the weekends, and Husband and I chatted online quite a bit (this was in the AIM days).\n\nI suspect Husband is an ISTJ, he's a programmer. I'm a data nerd.
2	Met my INTJ during junior year of college. We are in very different majors, but had a mutual DungeonMaster friend. One day I'm lighting up and doing jello-shots during a dungeon mission and this cute guy walks into the apartment. Someone in my DnD group said "Hey, you both play League of Legends -- you should exchange summoner names." So I gave him my summoner name on an old receipt, he added me on there, I sent very suggestive messages to him over the course of a few weeks and then he came over to "watch a movie" at my place ;)\n\nI find it is much easier for me to talk and express myself honestly online and I have met all 3 of my SOs in the interwebz. And in line with the generic ISFJ descriptor my first SO was abusive. But third time's the charm!
1	I met my intj at a social gathering at a mutual friend's place. Oddly, I wasn't planning on going but glad that I did! XD  We've been together for 5 years. 
1	I met my entj in high school! We just got married after being together for 5 almost 6 years! 
1	My boyfriend is an istp and we met through a mutual friend. We started off as friends first and we've been dating for almost three years now. It was a bit difficult at first because he is not very emotional so it was easy to assume he didn't care. He does care, but in other ways...he likes to build and fix things. He noticed I had no bed frame, so he built me one :)

5	Best jobs for ISFJ?	I've recently become unemployed and I'm really hurting for a new job but most things in my area (NE Arkansas) is mostly factory work and I just can't do it. What type of jobs do you all work best for ISFJ type of people?
3	I work security.  I've been doing it for 7 years. 
3	All of the above suggestions are suitable for an isfj but none of them are anything you can just jump into without some sort of degree or certificate. The real question is, what jobs are available near you that you would be interested in doing and if you're not yet qualified would they offer training?
3	Try looking for a job as an administrative assistant or office manager.
2	Caretaking ?\n\nNurse, or conselor.\n\nThese jobs are perfect for ISFJ's dedication and high work ethic, imo.
2	I'm a Respiratory Therapist. It's like nursing but we deal with only the airways. It's an awesome role especially if you live in an area with a hospital that value RTs. 
2	I'm an ISFJ and a social worker. It's a very rewarding job, but can be difficult at times. I like knowing that I am helping people and that I get to connect with clients on a deeper level. 
2	I'm a software developer, I enjoy it pretty well
1	I'm a professional data nerd, which plays into the S/J quite strongly.\n\nI've also done quite a bit of volunteer work with the local Humane Society, so that's been a great way to get out and do something helpful while avoiding some of the burnout factor of professional caretaking.
1	A rather old post so this may not be helpful, OP (I hope you've sorted something out?), but here's my comment all the same. \n\nJobs I've done or still do:\n\n* stacked shelves - hell. on. earth. avoid at all costs.\n* worked tills - alright as I got to talk to a lot of people and it's pleasant enough, though can get rather boring after eight or so hours.\n* president/manager of a political group at uni - even worse than stacking shelves, do not recommend management roles at all. (Admittedly, a lot of that may have been related to not liking the people, the group, or the politics involved.) \n* police officer - British, though, so I get the feeling we're a little gentler as a general rule and more into the talking than shooting :P Kidding aside, the culture in the police here is definitely different to that in the US, so this may not be relevant to you at all. My experience is that it's great for people who can follow rules, think fast on their feet, and who have good people skills and observational skills. The job is really 99% talking to people and listening to what they have to say. \n* admin in a GP surgery - absolutely love this! A bit chaotic and always busy, but there's a good mix of jobs to do and I work with great people. \n* first aid (for events, e.g. triathlons, festivals, etc) - also really enjoy this, although standing around waiting for somebody to be injured can be a bit dull and stressful. I like the quick-fire problem solving and the patient interaction and care, but I'm knackered after a long shift.\n\nI'm planning on training as a teacher after I graduate. FWIW, I know a lot of ISFJ teachers and trainee teachers. 
18	Having a hard time getting "close" to people	Especially when it comes to a person I take special interest in. Is this just me, or is it an ISFJ thing? \n\n\nI'm fine with the "getting to know" phase, however, I cannot move beyond that. Conversations end up dying/become less meaningful, then I inevitably come off as boring. I know it may just be lack of common interest, but I find this happening repeatedly especially when seeing people on a day to day basis at uni. Also (most likely a "me" thing), I find it difficult to hold long conversation, even among my friendship group or my closest friend who I've known for 10 years. 
12	I don't know if it's an ISFJ thing for sure but I relate with you. \nI can talk to someone and get to know a little bit about them but it kind of just dies from there. I come off as boring to someone that doesn't take the time to be patient with me and the fact that I can't immediately share everything about myself. \nWhen going to school there would be people who'd ask my name, about an article of clothing or something. I'd ask their name and be polite but nothing ever came of those exchanges. I don't know if I was doing something wrong or what the person was wanting to get from the experience though.. \n\nI also find it pretty difficult to keep a conversation going for a long time unless the other person is able to drive it. Ask questions, lead into new topics and such because I find it difficult to do that. My closest friend is an ISFJ as well, our conversations don't really last that long and one of us usually just stops replying. I don't take an offense to it, just seems normal. She has a hard time connecting with others as well. Perhaps it is an ISFJ thing heh. We are for select people who take the time to understand our quirks and how we are. I don't think you should feel bad about the conversations not working often, eventually you'll come along someone who you click with. 
6	Omg, I was quite certain it was just a "me" thing. I can't carry a conversation to save my life. And when I try I'm boring as hell. I can always tell when their eyes start to glaze over. Ugh. It's frustrating. I've never tried to cultivate that side of me but have realized that being a listener was the way to go. However, that's only good up to a point. Eventually the other person runs out of things to say or expects a dialogue not a monologue and becomes equally frustrated. I haven't been able to fix this though so I've got nothing to offer in a way that would be helpful. :-/
2	I feel this way to some extent. It is *very* hard for me to open up to people.\n\n*But* the very few people I have opened up to mean so much to me. I honestly feel like I could tell these two people almost anything.\n\nI think for me it is just harder to be open in person and so my two best friends I have found online... one I flew out to meet a few times and he has flown to visit and stay with me too... the second became my boyfriend as we went to same university and started talking through facebook and a videogame we both played.\n\nI think for me it's just so tough to find someone... but once I do they became the people I would do anything for -- and I love to remind them of that.\n\nBest of luck.
6	Secrets	Hey all :) how are you at keeping secrets? Secrets of others, secrets of your own. Do any of you have any secrets you plan on taking to the grave? No need to spill them, unless you feel the need. If so, how do you handle it internally? 
3	For the most part, I'd like to think I'm pretty good at keeping other people's secrets, unless it could bring harm to them or someone else in keeping it. \n\n\nFor example, one of my friends once confessed that he was planning to cheat on his girlfriend, and there was no way I could keep that a secret with a clean conscience. I told him either he told his girlfriend, or I was going to, but I couldn't stand by and watch it happen like that. \n\n\nAs far as my own secrets, it depends. There are a few very select people in my life who know most of my secrets, but even then, I still keep a lot to myself, and there are a few that I'm taking to the grave. Sometimes it's just better for all parties involved if things stay buried.
3	That's an excellent question. I'll have to ponder that a while before I answer. 
3	This might be a rather simple answer, but I tend to hear and forget the secret haha! I can safely say I don't spill secrets.
2	Good question.\n\nWhen it comes to someone else confiding in me about something, I usually don't have a problem with not telling another person about it. I kind of have this "counselor" type rule for myself where I am intentional about not spreading other people's business (unless it's in regards to their personal safety or the safety of those around them).\n\nHow about you, OP?
2	I will keep a secret until the grave. I take it really seriously when someone trusts me with a secret. I have maybe two secrets of my own that I will probably keep to myself until the end as well heh. I really don't feel like I have to handle anything by not telling the secrets of others or my own. If I have something to fess up to I will, I really hate how it feels to hold something in if I shouldn't.
2	When it comes to the secrets of others I kind of have something like a personal "don't ask, don't tell" policy. Sure there are things that I will not tell no matter what, but for a lot of things I won't bring it up unless the information is relevant. Now, there are different levels of relavence. Something that is not important at all might get brought up because the conversation was barely relevant, whereas somethings will only be said if I am directly asked about it. Again, if it is something that I know the person wouldn't want revealed to others, I won't give out the info to any circumstances, but for things that are causal info or won't have any effect on anything, then there's this policy.\n\nAs for my own secrets.... Some of my friends really hat how little I actually tell them about my inner feelings and secrets... Take that as you will.
1	I have a very tight lip about secrets. For my own secrets, it depends on my relationship with the person. Assuming we're talking about a really close friend, I will tell them only if they bring it up. Almost like I need permission for spilling the goods. There are some times where I go all Tsundere and really want them to ask me and try to start conversations that pertain to that secret without directly hinting at it. \n\nI have a hard time dealing with difficult secrets and I have a hard time reaching out to people to help me. Again, wanting permission to talk about it. It usually gets to the point where I talk about the secret but not directly. Ex. I have a hard time petting dogs but I actually say, "I have a hard time interacting with animals." Essentially just making the secret really vague. \n\nIn regards to other people's secrets, I stand firm to how they want the secret to be treated. If they only want me to know, then I'll keep it locked up tight. \n\n
1	I am good at keeping them.\n\nDepending on the secret, do not handle it well internally.
7	Feeling guilty of doing / saying / thinking selfish things?	We're all human so at heart we're naturally selfish beings.\n\nHowever, when we do (or think of doing) something we want to do that would be at the expense of someone else in some way (even if it's minor as wanting to eat something when other people want to eat something else) does anyone else here feel bad?
2	Yes, but in a slightly different way. My kids are college graduate ages (adults but in age only, lol). They're still dependents but they're working. But, for example, whenever I go out to dinner with friends or my SO my kids always end up popping into my head making me feel guilty for eating a nice meal. It's not that they wouldn't want me to, that's just the way I think. It's even harder to order dessert. But oftentimes I do anyway but I still feel guilty for having something and not sharing it with them. Same with buying things like new clothes or shoes. Besides the fact I absolutely detest shopping, I find it even harder to buying something like a new pair of jeans when I know they could use new clothes, too. I don't know. I'm just weird.
2	Yes. \n\nI have started going to therapy and I like to ask her if my feelings were justified -- because I pretty much never feel that my negative feelings towards others are justified and instead feel like I should be angry at *myself* instead of x.\n\nBest of luck to you. We are allowed to be selfish. We just need to allow ourselves to not feel bad... something I still haven't mastered.
1	I don't, but if someone else talks about it, I start feeling guilty that I didn't think of that too. I have to stay away from a lot of posts and threads about customer behaviour, for example, because people there feel guilty about things that I never thought twice about when I actually worked customer service (speaking up about problems, choosing not to chat with an employee when tired, even taking "too long" to put their change away), and after a while their anxiety and guilt starts to overwrite my own experience. I start feeling like a hard bitch for doing things that I never, ever expected my own customers to feel bad about.
1	I used to feel guilty a lot more than I do now that I'm older. I mostly give others first choice in choosing what to eat but if they want me to choose then I will with no guilt. Then they'll complain about their food and still no guilt. I'm grateful, guilt is exhausting.
9	Caring more about others than they do you?	Hello all! I've been having an issue lately with a friend who I care about a lot and consider close.\n\nUsually me caring about others more than they do me doesn't bother me at all but it's really been bugging me with this particular friend. We spend a ton of time together and lately he's been kind of weird with me. To the point where I'm starting to get upset/hurt and feeling like he just doesn't care. I've mentioned how he's been weird and he acts like he doesn't know what I'm talking about.\n\nAnyway, I was thinking of distancing myself from him but then I feel like I'm being silly. I don't really know what to do here...wanted some thoughts and opinions from other ISFJ'S. Also, as a side note I am happily married and I'm 98% sure the guy doesn't like me romantically. If anything I think he might be uncomfortable with how much he cares about me (unromantically...) but I don't really know if that's the case.\n\nAlso, we haven't met in person yet and when I told him I was going to be where he lives visiting and asked if he was available...he blew me off. When we talked about it before he wanted to see me. So...I'm confused at this point.
3	Exactly my problem with a close friend these days. I have gone out of my way in the past for her happiness. I am being ignored and getting a cold shoulder for no reason. I know there is no reason because the last time I talked to her she gushed about how she loves my willingness to help with an issue of hers. \n\nThis has been a pattern, as you say. I care about people's issues and am consistent in checking up and offering help if they are going through something, whilst getting minimal in return. \n\nThat said, in my moments of need, things tend to work out randomly and miraculously, so it's true what they say: Do good, and good will come to you.
3	I used to deal with this on an absurd level. It was really a big part of being overly sensitive to things. Then, I read [this article](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_in_adults#Styles)  on attachment, and Anxious-Preoccupied really spoke to me. And I realized that it wasn't really a part of my personality as much as it was an insecurity of mine. It may have been amplified by my personality, but it was not a concrete part of me. \n\nIt took a few months and constantly rethinking my first reaction, but eventually I was able to see that people weren't ignoring me or not caring, and that not everyone shows care the same way I do. I show it by being immediately there for all of my friends and helping them with whatever they need. Others help differently, and that's totally okay. And it doesn't mean they care about me any less than I about them. \n\nIt's hard to keep in mind, but if you constantly remind yourself that the people who are sticking by you are doing so because they see value in you and want to be around you, you'll soon start to realize that it's simply illogical for them to go to so much effort to pretend they care when they actually don't. And if they're not wrong, then it must be you're looking at them wrong. \n\nTry the new viewpoint and see how it goes. You might be surprised at how quickly friendships can get better :)
2	My experience with this type of behavior has lead me to discover (and confirm) I'm attracted to psycho/sociopaths (male and female). I know now how to spot one and when I do I distance myself from them. They're totally not worth investing a single second of my time. I suggest reading up on the subject to see if this is the case for you. If not, I'm really not sure what else to tell you.
2	Did he started acting different once you said you were going to be where he lives or before already? Could be that he's uncomfortable meeting up.\n\nIs he still taking the initiative with starting discussions so now and then or does it all comes from you? If the latter either something happened in his live, he got scared for meeting up or for some reason he doesn't really want the friendship anymore, but doesn't dare to say it, so he prefers to let it bleed dead.\n\nTo protect myself I ditch the people who I notice put me very low on their priority list. It's not worth my time, energy or worries. When I meet them since we are going to the same event for example we can still have a nice chat, but I won't try meeting up actively or staying in touch.
10	Inability to shut off the empathy valve. Is this just a "me" issue or an ISFJ trait?	I can't turn off the pain and suffering of others. Recently, I read this article (http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/06/dashcam-footage-of-cop-tasing-dragging-and-dropping-teen-is-unsealed/) and after reading it I couldn't even bear to watch the video. Any story I read or hear about that involves human suffering at the hands of others, avoidable human suffering specifically, drives me insane. Including global horror stories. I don't understand how people can harm other people with total disregard for human life. I run the trauma over and over and over again in my head wondering "why?"! Why did this happen? Could this happen to me? Will I be next? I put myself in their place or in the place of the parent like the teen in this particular story. Incidences like this happen "all" the time. Abuse of power (don't get me started with child abuse), sexual assaults, murder, reckless driving, the list is endless. Isn't it enough that we have things beyond our control like disease, aging and death? Why are we continuously maiming, emotionally scaring and killing each other? And why can't I turn off the empathy?
5	Can't say much other than I agree that it's hard to turn off the "empathy valve" (great term for it). I always feel sad when I see others by themselves, looking down, etc. I also hate when I see reddit comments talking easily about hurting others: "We should kill all poachers," "poachers deserve to die" blah blah. They are humans too and we should understand the circumstances that made them choose that lifestyle over others... We cannot even begin to grasp that perspective because we are so far from it.\n\nAnyways... I am going to therapy and seeing if that helps. I also recently saw a psychiatrist and got on medication which is supposed to sort of "lessen" my feelings. I am hoping it helps because it is a miserable life to live when someone calling you an asshole online can make you sad for hours.\n\nBest of luck. You aren't alone, -- nothing is ever just a "me" issue with 7 billion people on the planet.
3	I'm the same way. I used to not be bothered by any of it, but as I've gotten older it's gotten stronger (and I'm only 18 haha). I don't notice it so much when reading, but any visual of anything bad makes me incredibly uncomfortable. Sometimes it gets ridiculous; I was watching Avengers 2 and all I could think of was all the people dying and their families and how much grief so many people must be experiencing... and once in class we watched live footage of a tsunami as recorded by locals and everything was just too much for me... I just buried my face in my hands and started silently crying in the middle of class. It was pretty embarrassing. I do wish I could turn it off at times, but then again our empathy is supposed to be something that makes us unique. 
3	There have been things happening in the media I had to completely remove myself from because it was affecting my day to day mood entirely too much. I feel like I take on what others are feeling, or like, the "energy" of what's going on, even if I don't want to and try not to.

8	ISFJ Guys: Need Help Understanding Y'all	After poring over this for the last two weeks, I've decided to come to Reddit and get this issue out of my hair once and for all.\n\nI met an ISFJ guy a couple weeks ago through a mutual friend. I was instantly attracted to him, but refrained from letting anything escalate because I am currently in a long-term relationship (almost 6 years now). However, a series of strange things happened and I am still trying to figure out if I had misread his behavior or not. Let's call the ISFJ guy, Tim.\n\nI sincerely didn't think that I would see Tim again. I had invited him to come out to my church, but didn't think he'd actually come. However, he did end up coming twice, and the second time he came, I was the only one available to host him and his friend both because my boyfriend was away that weekend. Tim said he had to leave by 6pm, so I figured our time together would be short. From 3pm-6pm, we hung out and ate with a large group of people. Some of my friends teased him about me and I remember him blushing a lot. But I didn't think much of it because he's a very shy, nervous, reserved, and quiet guy. \n\nWhen it became 6pm, I invited him to come to a going away party with me and everyone else. Despite having said he had to leave earlier, he came and stayed the whole time. We ended up talking the whole 3-4 hours. We started to get playful with each other. I said I was going to go to a bookstore after the party and I invited him to come. He initially declined because his home was very, very far and the bookstore was in the opposite direction. However, I pushed a little and said he should come since he was leaving the country in two days. He relented and ended up coming. We stayed there until closing time (10pm) and had a great time just talking, getting to know one another, slightly teasing each other, etc. We had such a good time that he invited me to another hangout the next day (granted, with another friend). \n\nWhen we hung out the next day, he seemed nervous all over again. He was smiling a lot and a little red, but like I said - he tends to be a nervous guy. While we were all shopping (him, me, and one of his female friends), I swear I saw him glance at me a few times very discreetly. When I opened my phone to check my texts, he was right behind me and I swear I saw him glance very briefly at the screen. Also, this is a bit random, but I was carrying a giant finger toy absentmindedly. While I was looking around, he came carrying the same giant finger toy to poke mine. It seemed kind of flirtatious. However, the minute after I started talking about my boyfriend (our other friend was asking a lot of questions), he immediately became... different. He was noticeably more "tired" and "bored." He became less active. He seemed to shut off. I should mention that whenever I mentioned my boyfriend, he seemed to do this.\n\nI was pretty certain that he was at least a little attracted to me. He didn't really know what to do with his hands. On Sunday, he was extremely nervous and flushed bright red upon seeing me. By the end of Sunday, he was laughing, smiling, and confiding personal things to me. He spent practically the whole day with me that day too. On Monday, he seemed to show all the signs again.\n\nHowever, our mutual friend did mention that Tim tends to be very laid-back about time and probably felt a little lonely because all his friends had already left the country by then. He said that at the most, Tim probably just genuinely enjoyed my company and thought I was cool. Also, Tim tends to hangout with a lot of girls. He's just that kind of guy. He's genuinely nice and tends to just go with the flow.\n\nI did confront Tim after Monday. I asked him nicely if he had done all those things because he was interested in me. He said no and said he was sorry for making it seem that way. \n\nI'm going to admit that I am hoping he was attracted to me - at least a little bit. He has reasons to lie. He knows I have a boyfriend that I love very much. He was leaving the country in two days. His feelings probably didn't gain enough traction for a confession of any sort. It was probably a brief infatuation at best.\n\nI have told my boyfriend about the whole situation and we have dealt with it as well. I am ready to put all of this behind me, but I just want to know if I was wrong to think that this guy might have been crushing on me at least a little bit. \n\nOh, I should mention - Tim told me he was an ISFJ. I am wondering if it's typical of ISFJ men to just go ahead and do things like this or go this far without any feelings whatsoever. What do you guys think? \n\nThanks for the help. Like I said - I'm going to move past this as soon as I get an answer. And no - nothing happened at all between Tim and I except conversation.
6	I'm an isfj guy,  I think he handled it in the way I would have.  Wants to get to know you "deeply",  eventually he falls for ya (although he probably started out that way). In the end he can't bring himself to say he had feelings (it would complicate things).  Thought it better to cut his losses and let go.  From the info you provided I think he liked you,  but he knew you had a boyfriend and his morals don't allow him to intervene. 
3	Isfj guy here too. I used to have a crush on this girl for a long time. And my social behavior was almost exactly how you described Tim's. Every time before I saw her, I would get nervous and flustered. But whenever I would be hanging out with her in groups, over time I would slowly adjust and get more comfortable in interacting with her. If I were Tim and this whole ordeal was just over the course of like a week, and I knew you had a boyfriend, I would've done the exact same thing.\n\nI think it's just in the isfj's nature to not want to hurt you/ cause anything disruptive to happen in your life. 99 times out of 100 they would rather suffer themselves than see that they caused pain in the life of someone that they care about.
2	I would see myself doing this kind of thing.\n\nISFJs and ENTPs are in the same quadrant. We share the same functions.\n\nI would be more in the lound and brash tsundere end, but all the rest may be in common : \n\n * Blushing\n\n * Nervous tics :\n\n  * Twisting hands\n  * Nervous laughing\n \n * Stealthy looks\n\n * Following even if it means having my sleep schedule screwed up (It's a bigger sign of interest from me personally as I'm pretty rigid about my sleeping time, as I'm autistic. No sleep means not picking up social cues, means being screwed hard.)\n\nI think there is nothing surprising in how he behaved. Clearly crushed.\n\nJust the phone thing that make me uneasy as it happen to me to read other people's phones above their shoulder, when I know it's not respecting their intimacy. It's a curiosity reflex for me, and I snap out of it when I remember what I'm doing.\n\nI'm a bit ashamed of it, though.\n\nThere is one thing that kept my attention : the church.\n\nChristian ?
1	ISFJ guy here, all that has been said from the other commenters is true, I can see myself doing some of those things to an extent. \n\nIt seems that he was definitely attracted to you. It happens to us easily if you are our 'type'  (sorry not the greatest word), it's really quite overwhelming and we might do things that may be contrary to what the norm is for us. I suppose that is the way we handle it. \n\nHe definitely would have thought about the day a lot and that's why he apologised and feigned the truth about liking you. It is not our intention to seem deceptive or sneaky but I think we do this to preserve how others might perceive us. You handled it really well, you were very nice about it. We are a little fragile sometimes and  things which may seem small have a lasting impact.
1	I can say this very thing happened to me recently.\n\nIn addition to what everyone said above, you probably didnt mean to lead him on but after hanging out and giving the impression you had a mutual long term interest (with how flirtatious it seemed) then suddenly bringing up a boyfriend after makes it seem like all the effort he put to giving you attention was a waste.\n\nWhile he was being nice, he was probably disappointed and likely beating himself over it for thinking he even had a long term chance with you.
20	How does an ISFJ flirt?	So I am an ISFJ, but I'm wondering if the way I flirt is common among us. I usually end up being incredibly sassy, sarcastic, and try to learn as much about the person as possible. \n\nEither that or I completely avoid them in case they think I'm flirting and I'm not willing to risk that even though I am interested because maybe they don't like me. \n\nSo what about you guys?
7	Yeah, my method is pretty much the same as yours. :) I'm always afraid of teasing someone a little too much and scaring them off, though. 
5	Same! I'll try extra hard to make the object of my affection laugh or I'll completely distance myself god forbid they realize I like them. Unless you get a few drinks in me, then I start touching their shoulders/hair/back/etc and get quite a bit more forward.
3	Same. If someone is trying to flirt with me and I'm not interested but am up for some entertainment, I will be sassy and cute. If I'm actually interested in someone I will hardly let it on for a very long time. I'll talk about trivia or just friendly topics. Or even better, nothing at all. When I'm comfortable with them I'll be clever and sarcastic but also helpful and sweet until I'm mush!
3	As others said, pretty similar. I like to tease/joke, be a bit mean (jokingly), etc...\n\nIn some cases I lay it on thick. I feel like a lot of people think ISFJs = prudes, but I was the sexual initiator in a lot of my relationships. And I am so thankful for winky emoticons! ;)
1	Le sigh...I'm the same.....
1	I don't know if it's common to all ISFJs, but I most definitely do this
1	Same here, although I tend to be that with quite some girls. Not just the ones I have a special interest in.\n\nFunny to see that many of us flirt that way.
1	I'm on that boat.  
1	Same boat ! 
1	Hi I'm a Esfj but my Isfj best friend seems to be sassy and  sarcastic towards the boy I like and she knows I like him . It sometimes hard for me to tell when she is flirting but she is sassy towards the boy I like and I am on the shy side. Is she flirting or being her sassy self?  but it seemed to be more than usual. Don't  get me wrong I love my best friend but is she flirting with the guy I like?
6	Long distance ISFJ friendship	My best friend is an ISFJ (I'm an INFP), but we live over a thousand miles apart. So we have different circles of local friends and we've watched each other's friends come and go, all the while sticking with one another adamantly. We've both especially connected over our dislike of what friendships in adulthood seem to be (short-lived, little effort, not much consistency... as a 20 year old fighting idealist tendencies, I could write a book about this).\n\nBut it really sucks being so far away from each other and it makes me feel like I can't really be there for her when she needs it, so I do my best to understand her from afar. She's also been pretty hurt by friends in the past, so she's cautious to trust, even after a few years of being close.\n\nAnyway, I'd love tips for making an ISFJ feel valued and loved long distance! Also, what's are the best responses you've received when you're having a really tough day or freaking out about some bad stuff happening in life? It's hard to know when to fix and when to only listen.\n\nThanks!
2	This sounds identical to my friendship with my INFP best friend. We live far apart, and we've watched each other struggle with other friendships and relationships, but we've been there for each other through all of it.\n\n\nHonestly, my INFP didn't even have to really do anything apart from just being there for me. It took me a couple years to open up to him fully, but now he's my go-to for everything that happens in my life. He's always there if I need a shoulder to cry on, and he's been unconditionally supportive of me through the years. \n\n\nIf there's one thing I love about INFPs, it's their emotional intelligence in regards to other peoples' feelings. My best friend always knows if I'm upset, without me even having to say anything, and he's really good at calming me down, or comforting me with just his words.

3	No, but this sounds like an amazing idea!! Might just start doing that haha

5	Does everyone faces introvert/extrovert problems in gym?	The in charge of the gym I go to asks me to be more outgoing and interact with others a lot. He doesn't understands the concept of introversion and how it's different from shyness. I have a feeling that I have read someone else complain about this very thing before. Is this a common problem?\n
2	I go to a YMCA to work out and never have had an issue with forced interaction at all. Most people at my gym who are working out by themselves wear headphones so small talk isn't a big thing. Maybe you could try that? If I were you, I'd Just be confident in yourself and talk to people only if you know them or want to talk!
1	Nothing about your gym sounds normal to me. It's completely normal not to be social at the gym, and while it's normal for them to play music, I've never been unable to hear my own music. I don't know if there are other gyms in your area, but in any case I would start saying "no" to Mr. Be-More-Outgoing, because exercising quietly is a perfectly valid and very common thing to do.
12	"I've idealized the person I want. I keep waiting for the friend that will appear out of nowhere and hug me and tell me 'Look, it will all be okay. I am here for you, I am not going anywhere. You won't be alone again.'" I don't think I've ever related more to a post.	
1	As ISFJs we tend to be nurturers/guardians and are loyal and supportive to others, sometimes at our own expense. What we really want is to receive that same unwavering love that we give.
4	Jenna from MTV's Awkward is basically your spirit animal. --ESFP (:	
-2	You really shouldn't be using the term 'spirit animal' It belongs to native american culture, not right to use it in an incorrect, disrespectful way.
0	Unconventional Wisdom	My fellow ~NT~ friend and I are throwing around an idea for a podcast. People write in and we dispense rational, scientific based advice, divorced of feeling or sympathy, a la Data / Spock from Star Trek.\n\nIt would require research on our part for some questions. For example, if someone writes in about a contentious relationship, we'd have to look up the different styles of amygdala  hijack (fight or flight response to stress) and how to deescalate the situation. \n\nThere would be NO "tell the person how you feel" or "just be yourself" or "love yourself at your size", feeler advice. \n\nJust cold hard, science based, advice and an action plan attached to it. And of course some ~NT~ snark. \n\nSo I'm taking a survey. \n\nHow many of you think this could make an entertaining podcast? \n\nAdditionally....\n\nWe are currently taking advice requests from people 18+ to make a dummy run of the podcast (to gauge how long it should be, editing, style etc)\n\nOur test run will not be put out to the general public, but if your letter is selected we will send you the audio file of our test run. \n\nOf course, your identity would remain anonymous. \n\nYou can send a letter here.\n\nunconventionalwisdompodcast@gmail.com\n\nIf you have any suggestions or comments, I would love to hear them. We are in the planning stages now, and any ideas are appreciated. 
1	I, for one, am totally interested. This subreddit isn't really all that popular. But keep posting updates in here! 
5	INTJ here, married to an ISFJ	I recently got back into studying these personality types, mostly to pin down mine in hopes of giving my wife some material to study to get to know me more, and to encourage her to do the same. I've gone back and forth between INTJ and INTP, but after reading up on the traits of these two personalities, I've realized I am pretty firm in INTJ territory.\n\nMy wife took some tests and got ISTJ and INTJ on different tests, which surprised us both immensely, since absolutely NOTHING in the personality profiles rung a bell. I thought she seemed more like an "Fi" than "Ti" so we looked at ISFJ and INFJ and the personality descriptions for ISFJ were absolutely spot on.\n\nMy first question is: have any of you taken a MB test and gotten skewed results? Were they *that* far off? I was wondering if my wife answered the questions with how she thinks she *should* be instead of how she *is*, especially since I asked her to take the test and she got INTJ (my personality type).\n\nMy second question is: has anyone been in an ISFJ/INTJ pairing before? Has it worked? What problems arose, and if you overcame them, how did you?
3	Getting skewed results is very common. Don't just use tests to determine her type. Read up on the Jungian functions some more and type her by observing what functions she uses. \n \n If you insist on using tests as a reference, you might want to guide each other through them, answering carefully and true to yourselves.   \nYou could also use this test to determine the strength of your functions: http://www.keys2cognition.com/explore.htm  \n\nYou also said she uses Fi (introverted feeling). If that wasn't a typo for "feeler" in general, you might want to consider ISFP and INFP as her type as well. ISFP use the same functions as INTJ, but in a different order. The more rational and aloof INFP can give off an INTJ vibe as well.  \nIn any case, none of these types, including ISFJ, are actually much alike. If you immerse yourself into the topic, discerning and spotting functions in other people should come naturally for you as an INTJ as long as you can observe them.
3	Never heard about INTJ/ISFJ.\n\nI used to read about INTP/INTJ OTP on /r/INTP, on an other hand.\n\nConsidering how the trashcan of MBTI Reddit this sub is, I take this with a grain of salt.\n\nI've seen the Falconi type Square that uses Socionics intertype relationships on this thread.\n\nIt says best mach for ISFJs is …\n\nENTPs. \*Insert perma Pokerface here.* Duals partners.\n\nI'm not saying MBTI says your couple won't work : MBTI prescribes nothing, and don't even have something about intertype relationships.\n\nAnd I believe Socionics intertype relationships are more bullshit than the dank memes I read daily, which says a lot.\n\nBest to follow your Ni and her Si, I guess.\n\nIt was just my 2 cents on this. I'm not even sure it actually worth two cents.
2	check out this INTJ youtuber with an ISFJ wife https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIBYJ7DLNOlMNPbxmmQsWvg/videos
2	Do you think she uses Fi? Or do you mean she seems more like a feeler? \nIsfjs do not actively use fi (si fe ti ne). If she is dom fi she might be infp or isfp. \n\n\n
2	I've seen very far off mistypes. INFPs as ENTJs, ESFJs as ENFPs, almost every letter is off. I have never seen a legitimate INTJ and ISFJ together, but that's just my experience. I personally cannot stand ISFJs. \n\nAccording to this website (http://falconnl.github.io/TypeSquare/)\nINTJs and ISFJs have a super-ego relationship which is described as "a relationship characterized by differing values, discomfort, and mutual misunderstanding."\n\nSo INTJ and ISFJ are probably not the best match. \n
2	my gf first test was intj too. after second test (which was more precise)  she got isfj, which fits really good
5	ISFJ - RPG questing party model	Hey team :)\n\nI'd like input from ISFJs on my website. It's basically personal growth and life coaching meets video games. The main aspect of it is a re-skinning of MBTI in which each function has an RPG character to represent it.\n\nSi - Elf warrior (guardian)\nFe - Dwarf healer (cleric)\nTi - Elf mage (arcanist)\nNe - Dwarf hunter (gunslinger)\n\nEach function has abilities and a pre-made character with a backstory to give some spice. Click on the names on the website to go to each function's main page with RPG and technical explanations.\n\nThe level 30 Hero (you as Si), the level 30 Companion (Fe), the level 10 Newbie (Ti), and the Ai Escort (Ne) are on a quest to slay your dragons and uncover the epic loot behind each struggle.\n\nAs an INFP, I could use some help in making sure it fits your style. I've shared this site with some other types in their subreddits, and I'm curious how you all view your own ISFJ profile.\n\nI'd be very happy if I got some feedback on it in case anything needs to be adjusted. Is there anything that hits home? Anything that doesn't?\n\nwww.boss-mod.com/isfj\n\nThanks :D

1	ENTP, here.\n\nInstant bookmark. It's amazing.
1	Heh these fit basically all my favorite roles in RPG campaigns (Guardians = the tank/support, Cleric = the healer, Arcanist/Gunslinger = ranged fighting) \n\nThese are nice writeups you posted, good job.
8	Home ENTP ? =)	We have a "Home INTJ" on /r/ENTP.\n\nHe's really invested in the sub's life.\n\nI thought it was a good idea to let behind like minded people and be the Home ENTP for another sub.\n\nI chose you all. I already subscribed to the sub.\n\nI'll be more of an observer, at first, and then you'll see me more and more in the comments.\n\nI already came here for various purposes, but not just remain here and participate.\n\nI need just to know how y'all feel about that, though : \n\nIs it a good idea ?\n\nI don't mind that my reddit history is read. If you ever feel like I will never ever fit here, just tell me.\n\n---\n\nJust a bottom note for the mods : Flairs ? =) \n\nI think I can implement them myself if needed. You could just mod me with the fitting permission the time it's done, and unmod me afterwards. Win-win. \n\n
2	We actually have 2 lol!\n\nJust like this sub should have 2
9	What's with all these sources saying ISFJs struggle with abstract thought?	So I've been looking at all of the career advice that exists for ISFJs and for some reason multiple sources say ISFJs struggle with or don't prefer abstract thought or positions of academic research. That's like my primary skill, which I'd have thought of as characteristic of this type. \n\nIs this just nonsense or do some of you share the experience described?
6	It's just nonsense, you're not the only ISFJ in academic research. Si is well suited to  such things.
3	I guess what it means is that we have a low Ne and if that isn't developed abstract ideas could be difficult to process. So basically you must be well rounded or some shit.
2	I have an ISFJ friend and an ENTP friend, they usually argue when Ne and Si clashes. ENTP is always coming up with new ideas that may be creative but are too "out there" and ISFJ friend is always criticizing how unrealistic he's being. ISFJ always needs to organize stuff and ENTP friend gets mad at her "rigidness" or "narrow-mindness" for not seeing "the big picture" when ISFJ just wants things to be to be practical. I wouldn't say that ISFJs *struggle* with abstract thought but that they are *pragmatic* folks that rule out ideas that are too theoretical
1	> multiple sources say ISFJs struggle with or don't prefer abstract thought or positions of academic research.\n\nThose require two very different modes of thought, the source I trust the most when it comes to this type of thing is saying that ISFJs excel at academic research, but not so much at abstract thinking:\n\nhttp://www.truity.com/personality-type/ISFJ/careers
3	Grammarly.com suggests introvert = narcissist?	
5	That just doesn't particularly make sense.
20	Have you ever been called "boring" or can tell people think you're boring?	I feel like given our personalities this can be a possibility that can be common with our type.\n\nI've actually been called this by one who was once an online friend but got kinda stuck up.\n\nSometimes I can be self-conscious when I'm the quiet one of a group or one on one conversation. Sometimes I try to force a conversation 1 on 1 which works for a bit but then it proceeds to get quiet/awkward.
11	I routinely describe myself as boring. 
7	I relate to this so very much. \n\n\nPersonally I have social anxiety. I always try to look constantly for things to talk about and make sure I don't say the "wrong" shit. I worry too much about having an awkward 1 to 1 conversation and then just end up having one anyway... And then yeah, I feel as though I come of as boring. \n\n\nLooking for some advice too.
8	I clicked this thread so fast. I have been called boring and honestly, it really hurt. I was told I wasn't interesting and was boring. I thought my entire world was crashing because it was my partner at the time saying it. I was younger and he later explained things and apologized for the incident. It just really struck me and sticks as a vivid memory.. \n\nI get why we can be called boring. I do. Like I'm really hard to talk to, I have a hard time conversing, especially in groups (if it's people I don't know at all, forget about it). Someone that doesn't know me would definitely call me boring, quiet, aloof maybe heh. But they don't know me and what I really think and am like. My routine and enjoyment of things staying the same can be called boring too but I do enjoy doing little things to make the days different. Like going for groceries, seeing a friend, going for a walk, etc.\n\nI just don't force conversation. If someone talks to me I'll talk to them but otherwise I don't speak to or approach anyone unless I have to. Sometimes I do feel bad for being quiet when I'm with my best friend (ISFJ as well). She's better at conversation than me, asking questions and such so she makes up for my lacking areas. \n\nHope I didn't ramble too much, I just feel really strongly about this subject and haven't seen a good topic here in awhile so thank you for bringing it up.
2	No one's ever called me boring (that I know of) but I can totally relate. I definitely do not have the gift of gab and can immediately detect when I'm being boring, however, I am a good listener. So that's pretty much all I do in social situations. I listen to everyone else's conversations. XD
1	I've never been called boring, and that's probably the last description of me anyone would think of using. However, I have known people who were not even remotely boring who people called boring, so I wouldn't put too much stock in it.
1	I know I'm boring and I know others think I'm boring but I've never been called boring. That would hurt so much. I think I would punch someone in the nose! So sorry you were told that. What a jerk! I don't talk much but I smile a lot especially when listening to others. I'm a great listener.
14	Do you like to talk about emotions?	I don't know about you but I feel really uncomfortable talking openly about my emotions. Even to some people that are close to me I have hard time opening up and talking about deep stuff. For example someone in the group of friends starts talking about how they feel and it just makes me uncomfortable. I would rather talk about other pointless stuff rather than emotions and how we feel. But it's quite ironic since I'm pretty emotional and I'm just hiding it from others all the time. I don't know if this is isfj trait or is it just me?
4	I am totally the opposite. I *hate* constant chitchat. I don't mind it occasionally but constantly I really get bored. I do enjoy discussing my emotions, but with friends. And I love hearing out their feelings. 
2	I like talking about my emotions when speaking to someone who I fully respect as an equal and so can be 100% transparent with. Doing that sometimes makes me more transparent with myself than I might have otherwise been. I do always have that fortunately.\n\nHowever, there are other people in my life who if I were 100% transparent with I'd have to tell them that I find them morally lacking, inconsiderate, et cetera. No real reason to tell them that. Things work well enough otherwise.
2	personally, I want the intimacy, I'm just not comfortable enough to open up.
2	When it's with people I trust, oh yes! I love talking about emotions. It helps me to better understand them in some cases and get input from other people about what it might mean, or seem to mean, on their end.

20	Anybody else feel secure when you're prepared?	When I have enough supplies for a trip (even a single-day one), it makes me feel very secure. This could include having enough money, food and water, an extra iPhone battery and a charger, an umbrella or raincoat, or anything else of the like. \n\nThis also happens to me when I'm safe at home during a thunderstorm. I feel very safe and secure, even more so than during calm weather. \n\nThis does not, however, manifest itself in terms of having a plan. I don't usually plan out my single-day excursions in much detail, and doing so does not give me much security, only anxiety that I won't make everything on time. 
3	Definitely. I also get anxiety about being late, I always give myself plenty of time to get places. I don't usually take a lot of stuff with me - but what I do take I obsessively make sure I still have it with me. Making sure I haven't forgotten anything makes me feel secure.
2	Absolutely... I have been trying lately to go with the flow and push the boundaries of my comfort zone, but I think I secretly conspire against myself and I'm actually always prepared. The fact that I've thought about it probably means I've prepared, somewhat mentally, for being unprepared. Ah jeez.
1	Not really. I do always have enough food and water with me, but that's more because I eat and drink a lot.\nWhen going from A to B and having to be there in a timely manner I do want to know exactly what the travel scheme and back-up option are though. If it's just a hike after which I go back it doesn't matters at all.

14	i was sad then less sad. i think isfj people can relate plus i feel like sharing this.	Over the past few months i've been in a bad place. the kind where i in get into a groove of "this is what i did/am. what can i do to do it/be better? how to forgive better, how to endure more, how to accomplish more, etc"? and while that was happening i forgot to be nice to myself. so i spiraled from the positive need for constant self improvement toward a constant feeling of imperfection and inability to have my achievements meet my personal expectations. i felt like i was so tired and i worked so hard and i couldn't feel satisfied with anything i did. and i got really down and sad for a few months.\n\nthen yesterday a friend sent me this text, out of the blue: "You are the most logical loving person i've ever known. you don't make emotional decisions, but you are one of the more generous, compassionate, and self sacrificing people i know. When i have to get motivated to keep going after failures and hardships, thoughts of you always surface. if there is someone as cool and loving as you in the world, i can stand to be a motivated hard working individual that helps people too".\n\nshe is someone i respect for her ability to face down hardships and move forward. she takes life's punches in stride. and to find out that that's how she sees me was and still is a huge deal. \n\ni cried a bit when she told me that. i go so long with only my unforgiving and extremely demanding self as the judge of my life, that knowing this is how someone else i look up to sees me is world shattering and also relieving. like i can tell myself "it's ok. you're ok. you're good enough. right now you are good enough and you can rest and take it easy for a bit without any guilt".
3	Wow such a nice compliment to receive, especially in a time of need. I find myself [insj/infj] judging myself harshly all the time, for things that are minor and could be fine if I just let it go. When I'm in a down period I just keep trying to push through with the routine, but listen to my body at the same time. Extra rest, extra workouts, and extra nourishment. It'll pass, stay strong. 
2	That's inspiring. c:\n\nI'm glad that someone was there for you like that, having those types of people in our lives is something you should never let go of, but I'm sure you already know that.  It's actually more of a self-reminder, now that I think about it.  ~.~
2	Turns out I am also an isfj and type 5 enneagram. It's kind of scary how accurate the descriptions of those are. I assume from the way you talk and having a very close female friend that you would be too whereas im not, however your username throws me off. Anyway, if you need someone to talk to with similar mindsets? personality maybe, just pm me
13	ISFJ OR ESFJ: The inner struggle	Hey fellow isfjs! Do you all ever have the feeling that you fit more than one type? I'm sure everyone does but I feel as if I move between my base most established personality of ISFJ and it seems more frequently moving to a more ESFJ mentality about things. I do feel like I am still most recharged by being by myself and doing the things I like. But lately I'm feeling more outgoing, sociable and still wanting to insert myself into my more turbulent friend groups to make everyone get along and be the glue if you will. Needless to say, I'm having some confusion between ISFJ and ESFJ. Any thoughts? Thank you!
2	One is rarely 100% of a specific kind. I'm quite introvert, but I'm very passionate about sports and in those situations I tend to come across as extrovert. Especially at one of my sport unions they wouldn't think that I'm an introvert. I'm a trainer there as well and thus putting myself in middle of the entire group. During trainings I can be known as the loud guy. As soon as there's a party though I prefer to be with a small group of people or not being there at all.
1	I would wager that you have been exercising your auxiliary function which is extroverted. If you have always been recharged by others then maybe you could be ESFJ, but since you say this has only been going on recently I would wager it's more your secondary function than anything. \n\nAlso don't think that any social interaction is draining for introverts. Close friends and family often have a positive effect on them, especially for ISFJs. We are often called the most extroverted introvert for a reason after all. 
1	If you're up for a bit of reading, check out "Quiet: The Power of the Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking" by Susan Cain\n\nAlthough it's mainly focused on exploring the otherwise quiet introverts, there are sections that discuss what you're talking about. Simply put, there are four categories:\nIntroverts (pure)\nExtroverts (pure)\nIntroverted Extroverts\nExtroverted Introverts\n\nSounds like you may be fall into either of the last two. I too feel a disconnect between calling myself an introvert or an extrovert. Rather, I find myself to be more of an extroverted introvert. I love to socialize and hang out, but do need some serious downtime as well. It's about finding a balance for yourself.
1	Helping people is great and feels great, but so does taking a break.

9	Most chosen RPG Archetype/Class	I'm new to this sub and am also a huge nerd, so I was wondering what RPG class an ISFJ would most likely be? I play a lot of WoW and have constantly wondered this. I'm pretty into categorizing, so it's always peaked my interest to know what shoe fits best.\nI know that types may not perfectly fit a class, but which one would an ISFJ most likely be? If possible, answer in terms of a class and not a role, unless a role is what is chosen most often.\n\n*NOTE: Just copied this from my post on /r/ISTJ as I'm curious about this sub as well.
5	I usually choose the Wizard class or similar class - magic caster - if there's one available. I prefer to stay in the back and not get hit!
3	[deleted]
3	Ranged (preference for bows but magic is cool sometimes), Healer, Tank. Basically any support-ish class, not super into straight DPS unless absolutely needed.
2	I used to play WoW, and when I did, I nearly always played as either a Druid or a Shaman. I think I played as a Death Knight once or twice too, but I didn't like it as much.
2	I play D&D, and my favorite class is probably the monk. The one I'm currently playing will do anything he can to help the common folk. I guess I just really like the idea of a super disciplined fighter that needs nothing more than the clothes on his back to kick ass.
2	ISFJ here, and I love Hunter and Paladin and Warrior. Hunter for independent running around. Paladin and Warrior tanking for groups as far as WoW goes. When it comes to tabletop games, like D&D. I typically play Cleric.  I end up being called "the glue" because I'm the person who makes the group stick together.....
2	Normally, the magic builds, I like use spells, is just so cool. 
2	I like playing healers but not all the time, sometimes I like to be an adc instead of support in League of Legends. Jungle is nice sometimes but I feel too much pressure with the wrong teammates. For WoW I have always absolutely loved playing druids, hunters and anything kind of earthy. Alchemy and herbology are always an interest in any game. I always prefer to be a ranged character no matter what game I'm playing, I like to stay at a distance and deal out damage whilst dodging or support with heals and such.
2	I'm always playing as a healer or white mage on Final Fantasy games, I always pick Andriel the elf on LOTR: War in the North which I play a fair amount, I have her with healing style skill trees to support people, and it works very well. 
3	Dates and decisions	I know that us ISFJ's are quite good with our memory of dates, faces, names, lots of things that surprise others. But lately I've been feeling really low. The date is quickly approaching my exes birthday (My ex is an ENFP) and I feel so scattered and all over the place the closer it gets. We haven't talked in a year because I met someone else and dated him for months before ending it myself. (My ex and I weren't together when I met this new someone). We stopped talking when I did and I can't even express how much I'm missing him. It's slowly gotten worse over the year. It went form me almost never thinking of him to dreaming of him often and having him pop into my head constantly. I also talk about him like we're still good friends. All my fondest memories are with him, we grew up together from a distance.\n\nI was the one that stopped talking to him so I feel like if I don't talk to him he won't ever talk to me again. We didn't really end off on good terms.. He always told me I could come back but I feel like since it was so long ago that it may not apply anymore.. I just don't want to cause more bad than good. I want nothing more than to just talk to him again and see where we're at. I want him back in my life any way he'll allow himself to be. He could only be my friend forever and I'd be completely content.\n\nI'm sorry, I didn't mean to ramble or not be clear about what I'm wanting from the forum. I honestly don't quite know either. I would like to know how you feel about your exes birthdays, other special dates like your old anniversary even as well. I still haven't decided whether or not I should contact my ex, I want to be more sure before I make such a big decision. I know that I can't idolize him or expect everything to be good if I talk to him. I don't want or expect that at all. I just want to know that I'm not alone in how I'm feeling, this place makes me feel less crazy.
2	Would you really be OK if you were only friends? Be totally honest with yourself. \n\nIf you want to be with him then bring it up. Best case scenario you end up together. Worst case, you stop talking. At least then you have closure. 
2	Sorry I'm getting here late, but I felt a true connection with your post! \n\nI dated my ex for almost 3 years and ended it pretty suddenly when I realized he had many other things he'd rather be doing than spending time with me. I left him and met the man I eventually married, and I'm madly in love with (we've been together for 5 years now, married for almost 3.) \n\nI have some pretty simple questions for you to ask yourself: \n\n1) why did you break it off? \n2) Would things be different, or would they end up the same way of you reconnected? \n3) are you missing HIM, or companionship? \n\nI'm also an ISFJ, and have felt every single feeling you have mentioned. I used to have dreams frequently (sorry if tmi, but most commonly during my period.) it got to the point I had to google search the guy and creep to the extreme to see what he was doing with his life. I found out he was engaged to be married (since then he's been married) and lives out of state with a girl that shares many more similar interests with him than I ever did. I felt truly happy for him and noticed the dreams about him stopped along with any desire to think of him. \n\nI think part of me felt like I broke him. We also ended things in a not-so-nice way and I kind of cut him off completely. Seeing that he was so much happier and knowing that I myself am so much happier where I am was a huge relief! \n\nI used to get a sick feeling about our anniversary, or his birthday, or other special dates we shared, but then I remind myself how much better things turned out for both of us. \n\nI really hope you read this and gain some sort of positive advice from it! Feel free to message me with any other questions; just as our type says of us, I am truly an open book (: good luck! 
1	Sometimes it is more difficult but better to move forward instead of back.
12	Best ISFJ descriptions?	Sometimes SJ descriptions suck. Wondering what ISFJ descriptions you all have found that have been fair, balanced, relateable, etc? Thanks in advance!
6	I didn't know until I (very recently, actually) found out about my type that I absolutely hate being interrupted while in the middle of something. As random as that is, it really made me appreciate being able to complete a task from beginning to end uninterrupted! I've read many descriptions specifically for ISFJ that have stated this personality type hates conflict and longs to feel needed, and both of those traits seem to check out too. No matter how hard I try to not give a shit if someone doesn't like me, it still bothers me deep down. \n\nThe descriptions I have come to find of isfj's kind of make us sound like a bunch of emotional softies, (true for me for sure, but that's still harsh!), but some things I feel proud of are having the need and will to care for and/or help others, having an outstanding work ethic, and the urge to be prompt (otherwise put, very punctual/on time.) 
3	not isfj but from the isfjs irl I've met: good at remembering events related to people, tend to have good morals (not drama causing attention-seekers like esfps nor manipulative as esxjs), loyal to those they trust (not back-stabbing), plan stuff and do it (less likely to procrastinate), good at reading people (detecting indirect messages), caring (will mean it, not fake it to gain from others) etc. I really like you isfjs but your type finds entps annoying lol
3	This is a super long winded explanation and some of it might be more reflective of my friend rather than isfj's in general.  She's quite and serine unless you get to know her well. Afterwards she becomes something else entirely. Awkward stoicism turns into being a fully emotional and confident person. She has a hard time remembering to be logical and this translates into a lot of lost arguments and also a hard time explaining to people why she is upset when it is happening. She tends to overreact and she knows it so when she gets emotional and can’t get across why she is really upset and instead blows up irrationally until the other persons gets upset because of how irrational she is being. Instead of going through this process she holds in her emotions rather than having to deal with the aftermath of what amounts to a adult temper tantrum. Its not as bad as that makes it sound. Under the surface of all those emotions she always has a good reason for being upset she just can’t seem to say it. She is extremely punctual when she see’s got a good reason to be. She likes list and color coating, organizing and structure. She is afraid sometimes that she is broken because she likes to connect everything going wrong in her life together with thin connections and works herself up and gets depressed and cries a lot (this has to do with Ne being at the bottom of the stack i think). When she gets in these states it’s like she thinks that she has come to a full understanding of the world and the conclusion is that it sucks, even when the reality is very far from that she convinces herself for that moment that everything is horrible. Almost using that as a coping mechinism, like a prepare for the worst philosophy. She also has an obsession with people thinking that she is selfish. She is actually can be a pretty selfish person but not in the way she thinks she is. She has a hard time seeing past the way she is feeling about a situation even if there's a good reason to have caused some conflict. Logic will almost never break through to her when she is emotionally affected by a situation in which she feels that she has been left out or forgotten. She thinks if you are being logical that theirs is no way to understand what she is trying to say which is correct because what she is saying in that situation is that her feelings got hurt and when you try and rationalize it you are giving her an answer that she doesn’t care about. She doesn’t care why you weren’t there, she cares that you weren’t there. She is extremely loyal to a point and then will drop you like you are hot if she feels you are going to leave her. She either cares a lot or not at all(or so she wants people to think), maybe because it would be to emotionally draining for her to kind of care. 
7	Are we nice guys? I think I am, but what does that mean for us?	I was browsing in fapstronaut central and came across this [post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/4c5h1u/nice_guys_fap_a_lot_and_dont_get_laid_heres_why/), and it got me thinking about my life. I'm a solid ISFJ and I am pretty new to their fapless ideology and it's brought a lot of things to light for me personally. This particular post though, resonated with me on a pretty subconscious level. My reason for posting here is to probe /r/ISFJ on your(our) take on the self pleasing as well as how healthy our lifestyle is. I have never known a singular standpoint on the issue and I have never worked up the gall to bother any of my local ISFJ herd with such a personal question. To be honest, I'm only curious if I'm alone in my personal failures as a man or, since I'm probably not, what are your perspectives on what they have written here? \n\nAs a disclaimer, I don't believe Donald Glover to be the next Carl Jung, but he's offering a perspective, and that warrants some introspection.
4	intp here, you (isfj) guys are too nice to the point that it creeps me out, I have never seen another type that is more self-less than you folks; whereas esfp/estjs are selfish bastards, you guys give too much to other people. there's a thing called balance where you give as much as you take, i'm not saying you are people pleasing doormats but from my observation you are too caring and good to others to the point that you don't seem to take care of yourselves...anyways you guys awesome and the world would be shittier without you, don't be so hard on yourself
3	Maaan, that article was rough. True, but rough. Allow me to explain. For a while now, I've been aware of my 'Nice Guy' tendencies. I knew my desire to be needed, to be in control, my inability to express feelings yet expect some kind of recognition of an unspoken need. And it killed me to see all of this in me. It made me consider myself selfish, hopeless, and perpetually alone. Based on what you've said about the post, I feel like you might relate.\nBut here is the problem. Life has a lot to do with perspective. Now, I'm currently studying social work in university and one of the most core aspects is this idea of "strengths-based practice'. What this means is that, when someone is struggling, we don't look at what they are lacking but how they have grown and persevered; how they have used what limited resources they have to keep moving. \nNow, when I took the test last week and understood my ISFJ position, it made a lot of sense to me as it did to you. But all of these deficits that I saw as problems: the need to be needed, the desire to continually put others before myself, and other matters, these were all placed in a new light. They were perceived as strengths, not weaknesses. This confused me, but greatly encouraged me. \nThis didn't mean that I couldn't be selfish or manipulative. I could. But rather it helped me to see that when I understood how I thought, the issues that trigger me and bring out my strengths as an ISFJ, then I could use these 'deficits' for good. Do I need to be needed? Absolutely. So I can use that to encourage and support others in so much as they need it. In other terms, in moderation. This is easier said than done and I'm starting to ramble a little, but what I wanted to point out is that you are not alone. You are not alone in your shame and worries, and that there is some hope for us 'Nice Guys'.\n\nApologies in advance for bad formatting as am on mobile. 
1	The whole "nice guy" trope is misogynistic nonsense, and "No Fap" is a valueless cult.\n\nPeople say that I am kind. It isn't a problem for me and I don't feel like I'm not getting laid enough proportionally to my kindness because my kindness is not given implicitly in exchange for the hope of sex. Also I just have a lot of sex anyway.
11	MBTI blew my mind, now I'm lost.	I'll begin by saying, hello Reddit. \nI am a 24 (very near 25) year young female (newly found out) ISFJ. My entire life I have been labeled as:\n1) social butterfly\n2) ray of sunshine \n3) [flat out] extrovert\n\nAfter working as a florist in an upscale grocery store for a little over 2 years, I've suddenly become very unhappy. I feel as though I need to be doing something "bigger." Last Saturday my husband (ISTJ) wanted to get a book from Barnes and Nobel, so I happily followed along. I had the sudden urge to get some sort of aptitude test in book form (being the type that likes things I can handle), and was directed to "Do What You Are." I read it through in two days and was very upset. Almost threw the book at the wall! I had originally came up with ESFJ as my type, and the careers didn't suit me. I explained my frustration with my husband, to which he responded with, "thyme4vin, you're an introvert." I seriously laughed at him. Then he told me introverts get exauhsted working with people for periods of time; well as a florist in a busy grocery store, that's all I do. I re-read the book and took the actual test online and voila - he was right. \n\nI shouldn't have to explain how floored I am. Still. I honestly feel like I've been lying to myself my entire life! I've worked retail and food service since high school, and never understood why it was so difficult for me. Now I have clarification, and I can understand myself on a level I never did before. My issue is that I have no idea what to do with myself. I don't love my job like I thought I did. My immediate manager doesn't do half the amount of work I can do in a shift (I work shorter shifts than her), and I leave almost everyday feeling like I didn't do enough. Not to mention there is never a "thanks!" Or heaven forbid a "Wow! You worked your ass off!" I'm not looking for it all the time, but when I obviously busted tail and got shit done, say SOMETHING! \nAnyway, after discovering my type, here's some things I've realized I want in a job:\n\n1) part-time - my husband is my main priority. I like to keep a clean house for him along with having dinner ready. \n2) no travel - I hate driving; it stresses me out. I can make it to work and home, but not to different locations in between. \n3) creative - at least slightly. I have a need to be artsy. \n4) no interruptions - it infuriates me when I'm in the middle of doing something and someone wonders up with some stupid question! \n5) minimum "public" interaction - I hate retail. I am a people pleaser by nature and only want to work for those that appreciate and acknowledge that I am doing something FOR them! \n\nThings that shouldn't need detail: I'm hand on, very efficient, highly organized, and reliable. \n\nI've considered many careers, but I don't know where to turn. Something that has piqued my interest in a Visual Merchandiser for floral boutiques, home decor stores, or something in the realm of design (not fashion though.) the only issue is the high possibility of site-to-site commute. \n\nI don't have any formal degree due to my lack of understanding in who I am (until now) and where I want to end up. \n\nAny advice is appreciated, but keep in mind that I'm sensitive to criticism (:  \n\nEdit: first post; fixed format (or tried to. On mobile, sorry!)

1	INTP here. It's common for us Fe-Ne-Si-Ti types (you and I share the same 4 preferred functions, though in different order) to be the introverts most successful at extroverting, since we have the tools in place to harmonize with other people (Fe) and show nigh endless interest in them (Ne) as well as being able to remember details about them (Ti and Si). That **competence** in extroversion can in many cases for ISFJs, including yours, be mistaken for **preference**. That's what you're going through now and learning about yourself, and it can be an amazing journey.\n\nHere's a really good article about the ISFJ:\n\nhttp://www.truity.com/personality-type/ISFJ\n\nIt includes a detailed section you can click on near the top about good career options for you. \n\nI'd be happy to discuss this more; if you have anything to ask, feel free. 
7	Authenticity?	I didn't know ISFJ was a personality type until I took a personality test last week. It helps me to make so much sense of the way I think, particularly with regards to the things that bother me and can easily hurt me.\n\nMy question to you is: do you find it difficult to be genuine and authentic, to fully express yourself, as an ISFJ? Not in a deceitful sense, but more due to self-sacrifice and self-imposed standards\n\nI can't find where I read a excerpt on this question at the moment. I'll try and find the source later on though.\n\nEdit: I believe I may have drawn this idea from the quote, "ISFJs are most attractive when they are simply being themselves in a comfortable environment such as work, where their natural flow shows this kindness and dedication."
5	I'm glad you brought this up!  I relate so strongly to so many ISFJ characteristics, but I also read about how they seem to be the type that adjust their personality to the situation which strikes people as un-authentic.\n\nTo answer your question, yes, I do have a hard time being myself in front of certain types of people.  I have a really corny sense of humor and I love deep discussions about feelings and other non-manly things that my male engineering coworkers would never want to talk about :) I guess I've just accepted the fact that I don't need to feel comfortable around every person in the world.  As long as I have those people in my personal life, that's all that matters.
2	Yeah, I do tend to change my personality around certain people, for sure.  It depends on the person how much I change and what changes, but I do change for sure.  About the only part that stays the same is the crying at the drop of a hat part and the overly-protective part... both of which cause me serious problems in my day-to-day life on a regular basis.
11	Anyone like meeting new people but are too shy/afaid to initiate or talk to them?	I always like meeting new people because there are so many people out there in the world.\n\nHowever at the same time I'm either afraid we might not start off with a good impression of each, they have a not so good personality.
5	I enjoy meeting new people as well, but sometimes I feel like it's hard to snap out of that small talk mode and move on to different topics, I'm not sure how to properly transition and such. Then I get self conscious and wonder if I'm being too boring or something and ugh...
1	I definitely like meeting new people but I have a hard time with connecting to and staying interested in people. I also have a hard time being the one to initiate conversation or keep communication going between us. 
1	I feel like I'm always wanting to, but instead I just imagine what their personal life is like. Lol 
7	MBTI podcast: Interview with ISFJ Heather, who is an ex-Mormon, adoptive mother, kindergarten teacher and feminist	Hello! My best friend and I host a podcast about MBTI, and this week we interviewed an ISFJ who breaks many stereotypes - I figure you all may be interested! \n\nKindergarten teacher, mother and female badass Heather talks with us (ESFP Meredith and ENTP me, Kaila) about being an ISFJ beyond the SJ stereotypes. She grew up Mormon in a whole family of S-types and married young, but later experienced a feminist awakening after adopting a son and leaving the church and her husband.\n\nThis specific episode: https://soundcloud.com/when-myers-met-briggs/isfj-heather-glass\n\n* [In general: Soundcloud.com/when-myers-met-briggs](https://soundcloud.com/when-myers-met-briggs)\n\n* [Facebook.com/WhenMyersMetBriggs](https://www.facebook.com/WhenMyersMetBriggs)\n\n* [Subscribe on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/when-myers-met-briggs/id1060274982)\n\n* [Twitter.com/WMMBpodcast]( https://twitter.com/wmmbpodcast)\n\nLet me know what you think! \n\n(X-post r/mbti and r/exmormon \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/49pedu/podcast_interview_with_exmormon_adoptive_mother/ https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/49oylg/mbti_podcast_ep_16_interview_with_isfj_exmormon/)
3	I really loved this! As an ISFJ, I found a lot of things Heather said to ring true. She seems like an amazing person and she's gone through such a journey to achieve self-actualization. It's quite inspiring.\n\nI was also really interested in the Mormon side of it, since I'm married to a (male, ENTP) ex-mormon, but haven't really heard a first-hand account from a woman's perspective...what it was like being raised LDS and getting out. The story about how her parents moved to Arizona in order to get her away from a boy was absolutely shocking, but after getting to know a lot of Mormons, I can see how this type of overreaction was a legitimate response in their minds. Yikes.\n\nThanks again. I'm glad I got to listen to this. :)
10	ISFJ and INFJ video	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Erksd9xmQ\n\nI hope you don't mind me posting here! I am an INFJ that just got an ISFJ roommate. You guys are probably the most kind and loyal type. Thanks for being you!

8	10 ISFJs Explain The Ways In Which They Defy The ISFJ Stereotype	
1	I relate to 2 so much.\n\nFor the longest time I thought I was ISTJ because of the logic I like but I prefer/developed the the consistent/accurate Ti vs the well controlled/rational Te.\n\n5 is something I've developed more of recently.\n\nBeen in 6 situations.\n\nHave done 8 a couple of times.\n\n
12	Letting Go/Moving On	I'm curious to see how you all deal with letting things that meant a lot to you go, moving on from a close relationship, or any similar situation. As a male ISFJ, I'm learning that these are things I have serious struggles with.
8	[deleted]
4	As /u/avelaera wrote, I have a very hard time letting go until they do *something* that I just cannot handle in whatever way -- and then I am 100% gone.\n\nI have a few relationships I have let slip away, and I have serious regrets about them. Would have dreams my friend came and found me (after years of not talking) and sat next to me etc, woke up crying.\n\nOn the flip, once I was done with my first relationship and I had left him -- I felt so relieved and was moved on instantly I think (although I did spend about half a year in a weird limbo of not really loving him but unsure of how to break up and he guilted me intensely -- so that made moving on past the break up a lot easier probably).\n\nBest of luck to you, OP.
2	[deleted]
2	I'm working through this at the moment. I fell in love with an ENFP (at least that is what she tested) and we were seeing each other for a little bit. I could feel something change between us suddenly and I knew it was coming but I chose to believe that we could still be together. \n\nIt is fine between us but I am having a little trouble moving on. The part of me which loves her doesn't want to let go because I have so many good feelings and memories associated with her that I don't want to just fade away. But I guess they will and that's what makes me sad. 
2	I have a slight ambiversion to isfj, (predominantly Esfj) but I lean more toward that side of my personality upon reflection and regret.\n\nFirst and foremost, what caught me up was not being properly trained to embrace my own passions. I was often ridiculed for having different views on social norms and would often times revert to dominating conversations with tones and body languages. I had seen many people use this technique and hand have incredible results unconsciously and began to emulate it. (Namely my father)\n\nSecond, I made the mistake of thinking that the people I care for most would never have conflict with me. I clashed with religion, insecurity, and trying to be too good of a person because that is what made me feel good a bout myself despite being raised around of selfish (but good deep down) people.\n\nThird, I never got past the fact that I couldn't count on my family to keep their word and raise me to even get a driver's license because I had somehow managed to establish an alpha status by wanting to take care of everybody. My tone and body language gave an aura of false confidence that they all followed and I managed to bury myself in a hole with no true emotional support or societal guidance. I was a boy trying to play a man's game.\n\nFourth, I realized that by not following through on these values, I was becoming everything I never thought I would be and hated. I never ended up instilling my own set of personal values and identity. \n\nDominating a conversation with tone and body language only brought me pain and heart ache because I was attracted to people like myself who sought only to be understood and valued. I came out for the attention that I deserved as a child from people that I simply didn't connect with on a more personal not.\n\nLike a child I wanted to be love as an up and coming teen. Now as a self aware man, I want to be loved, hated, feared, and respected for standing for who I truly am, and the principles in which I will always be continuously fighting for.\n\nIf you skim through that read this:\n\nEmbrace your passions to the fullest, talk to a counselor and seek out other like minded people and connect. It takes seven good thoughts to cancel out one bad thought so the more people that you have to smile with and make smile, the stronger your courage to face conflict and embrace your passions will become.\n\nif you don't do this, then the people who hold people like us down, will continue to, because we have been molded at such a young age to believe that we deserve to be punished. \n\nStand up, be proud of who you are, seek personal development and like minded people, embrace conflict and stand by your principles so that people will learn to love, hate, fear, and or respect you. If you stay consistent with this and seek new experiences with different people, I promise that the challenges of being yourself will become goals to conquer.\n\nBe well my friend. Feel free to message or video chat me. (mysticmseray @Skype.)\n\n
9	Any engineers?	Just wondering how many of you are engineers? 
2	Going for software engineering, which sort of...isn't the same thing.\n\nIt's more....uhhh...lexical and less mathematical.\n\nLike I'm talking to the computer.
2	Me! I'm in my first year, but considering computer engineering or systems engineering.
2	Industrial engineering here!
1	I went to school for aerospace engineering!
1	I know an ISFJ whose an engineer.
1	Going to school for graphic design, but learning web development on the side, because it's more concrete.\n\nEDIT: Meant to imply I want to eventually get into software engineering, lol.
6	What is your love language? (Gifts, Quality time, Words of affirmation, Acts of service [devotion], and Intimacy)	I know a love language is an environmental factor acquired in your upbringing, but I'm curious to see your responses. 
4	Words of affirmation is definitely mine.  Someone telling me I look nice, they're proud of me, etc.  That stuff sticks with me for a long time!
3	Mine is acts of service from what I've gathered.
3	Quality time is my number one! 
3	quality time and words of affirmation 
2	Acts of service and quality time.
2	gifts and intimacy
2	Physical touch.
2	Acts of service mostly. 0 physical touch :o
2	In this order: quality time, acts of service, gift giving. They were all pretty close. Words of affirmation was my second lowest, and intimacy was definitely my lowest by a long shot. 
1	Thanks so much for the responses guys! Always will love this sub. Thanks again!
1	Acts of service & physical touch
4	ISFJ's! Opinions on ENTPs?	It's so unusual, but I recognized that ISFJs and ENTPs, if healthy. Get along really well. (Someone I liked was even an ISFJ at one point haha.)\n\nLong story short, I notice that ISFJs become decent friends of mine, despite having opposite variables, perhaps it's because we are both quite healthy with are mbti types.\n\nBut I have clashed heads with ISFJs before as well, same with ESFJs. When they expected me to be "this" and "that" I started an argument in which they took personally. ENTPs refuse to be controlled, and I feel as if ISFJs have expectations for there friends, and the ENTP may feel as if he or she is being controlled when they confront them about there expectations.\n\nAnd when that happens the ENTP feels as if the ISFJ is throwing a gauntlet down, that the ENTP is very happy to pick up. And thus, that's when the argument begins. Or normally, when ENTPs/ISFJs don't work out.\n\nYour opinions on ENTPs?\nHere is mine.\n\nI like the healthy ones, the ones that I can respect and appreciate.\nBut the ones that make me feel as if I am being controlled will often aggravate me to an argument.
5	I think the conflict is better avoided when ISFJ take in an entp in small doses. The devils advocate thing runs its course quickly, although slightly interesting at first. The the chaos of a thought train is easily seen as disfunctional and distracting. The spontaneity loses its shine after while. And the perceived lack of compassion when thinking through sensitive topics, is impossible to comprehend. \n\n\nI'm entp and my wife is opposite and, I've come to the conclusion that our relationship isn't as symbiotic as I once thought. I have much more to gain from her presence than she does from me. I can be draining or sometimes say the wrong thing and although she is understanding, it seems unfair that I can't offer as much a positive benefit. I know that my traits have undeniable value to her, but at a cost of stress. And I don't think that price is fair to her.\n\nTldr:\nWe as entp have far more to gain from these wonderful people, but they aren't nearly as dependant on us as we are off them. That at least my observation.
3	I'm an ISFJ, my boyfriend an ENTP. We have made it to 2.5 years so far.\n\nFrom the get go, we've been very curious about each other. There have been obvious misunderstandings, but we have only grown more to accept/appreciate our differences.\n\nI think opposites can not only get along but stay attracted if you appreciate the differences and not despise them. I personally find my boyfriend to be more complimentary than opposite. The way I see it, he's literally my other half, like yin and yang.\n\nAlso, it helps to be curious because you'll always want to know why a certain reaction/behavior happened.
1	I am an ENTP who recently asked an ISFJ to marry me, and we have been great.  The short version of my opinion...wait until they are in their 20's and have at least matured on some level or another.  I don't think things would have worked out if we met or dated earlier in life.  \n\nOh also be weary of the tendency for ENTPs to steamroll you.  I know it can be tough, but we really need you to call us out when we do something that negatively affects you.  Often more than once.  But this becomes easy with a little third party relationship coaching and an overall understanding of who the other person is.  Both types have a lot more to gain than lose in this combo.
1	You know they're your "duals" according to Socionics :) Meaning they're your ideal partners.
5	Bad experiences = desire for change?	Would you say negative experiences in your childhood from watching too much T.V and absorbing too many things about the world that make you upset give you a sense of desire to change the world?\n\nIt's a common thing that ISFJs don't really like abandoning their experiences, but what if it was a negative one? Also what would you say your political orientations are?\n\nAnd yes I'm ambitious like that.
5	I think my main motivator is a desire to help the disenfranchised, the sad, the lonely. This might be shaped by my own personal experiences, but I usually think of others when I think of changing the world. I want to change the world so that others can live better lives, and be happier in their lives. But, when I say change the world I do not mean by becoming a politician and actually forcing real change. I mean a more person-by-person experience. I want to make one person happier, then the next, then the next...\n\nWhat do you mean by "abandoning experiences"? Like, forgetting the experience? I doubt I could ever forget a truly bad experience. They probably shape a lot of who I am, because I feel so many things about them and they affect me a lot.\n\nI'm not sure exactly how to define my political orientations (just never looked much into what defines them). But I'd say democrat/liberal/progressive-ish (which was not easy or fun as I am from a very conservative state and family). I am rooting for Bernie Sanders this election. 
2	My mom had to take an old TV out of my room when I was like 4 because I found CNN and started asking her why unemployment was such a problem in Chicago. Also, seeing all the mentally unhealthy kids in my family and community was part of what led me to go into psychology.\n\nEdit: Conservative vs Liberal depends on the specific issue. Socially, I tend to lean liberal. However, this is the first election I can vote in and it's become such a shit-show that I'm honestly not sure what to do anymore.
1	An INTJ here but I thought I would throw out my opinion. I think the mind fears the unknown, pain, and annihilation. Annihilation means disappearing. The fear of death, insignificance, and being ignored fall into this category. Out of those three the fear of the unknown is the highest in my opinion.\n\nWhile it makes logical sense that if you have a bad experience that you would avoid that and try to change that, but become to familiar with it, and the mind will have a hard time giving it up. Self sabotage is generally because of this factor. It is summarized in the following poem rather nicely:\n\nVice is a monster of so dreadful mien\nthat as to be hated needs but to be seen.\nYet seen too oft, familiar with her face,\nwe first endure, then pity, then embrace.\n\nFor those of you that want to rise from the negative experiences that you may have had and help and change the world I laud you. It is not an easy thing to do. Please do not beat yourselves up over it if you find that you are trapped in a destructive cycle.
7	Female ENTP, Male ISFJ - Help!! (Saga Continued)	To recap: https://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/45walx/female_entp_trying_to_figure_out_what_went_wrong/ (Also posted in the ENTP subreddit).\n\nFollowing is an update:\n\nAfter much soul searching, I got the courage up and asked my ISFJ to talk. We finally got a chance to before leaving work last Thursday. I told him that I see this as temporary until he says it's not. I explained that I never once have taken him for granted. I also explained that I understand that he's been stressed both at work and outside of it, and that he feels that something is wrong. I said that once he figures out what it is, I would like him to let me know, and that we can work on it together. I emphasized that he can take all the time he needs to do so, and that if I found a solution to be wrong from my perspective, to let me know. I reassured him that I still love him. His response was to look thoughtful and say "ok". \n\nPast weekend (including Monday) involved a trip to Tahoe that was self organized with co-workers and friends. We rode in separate cars, stayed in separate cabins and didn't see each other all weekend. \n\nSunday messaged him with a link to Disney's Paperman, after discovering it. Turns out he'd already seen it but hadn't thought of it in a while. Friendly chat, with a recap of each other's weekend ensued. Talked about future self-improvement plans. Made sure I signed off first to go in search of dinner.\n\nYesterday: Bumped into him in the train station on the way home. I went to a local sushi place, had low carb options, and hot sake. Came home really depressed and confused(I suck at waiting). Chatted with one of my best friends in a different state. Saw he'd posted pictures he'd taken of one of my cats (his favorite) on FB, saying how they were terrible (which they weren't). Ended up messaging him on Hangouts:\n\n****************\nME: Hey, you up?\n\nHIM: Yeah, why?\n\nME: Just saw the (my cat's pics FB) post. Not terrible at all. But that's not why. I realized something tonight and wanted to let you know\n\nHIM: What's that?\n\nME: I realized why you may have felt like you were taking care of me: you helped me out with a lot during one of the lowest points in my life. No one had ever done that for me before. It was really nice to feel like someone was taking care of me for a change, and I felt safe enough to let go for a short while, as opposed to doing the super independent thing I normally do. I apologize. I thought I could also take care of you the way you were of me. I just wasn't good at figuring out what you needed. You needed someone that was fully independent for once, didn't you?\n\nHIM: Yeah, that would have been nice, but that alone isn't going to make everything work\n\nME: I'm not expecting it to. I do know that things were fantastic at one point on both ends, if I'm not mistaken. I also know that there is no reason they can't be again, and maybe even better\n\nME: I'm not asking for an answer now. These are just my thoughts\n\nME: You smiled at me today when you came to pick up lunch, before you could change your expression. It was the way to used to smile at me, the same smile thr always made me feel like everything was right in the world, no matter how shitty the day was. You tried to be distant in the train, later. You avoid me like you're avoiding something dangerous. Why is that? I can't pretend to know your mind. Th only thing I know is that if I were doing the same in this situation it would be out of a fear of changing my mind, because I'd know that I wasn't sure.\n\nHIM: You're not viewing things the way I am\n\nME: Maybe not, but I also know that life is to short not to try to fight for the person I love the most.\n\nME: So tell me how you view it from your perspective.\n\nHIM: I'm not going to talk about this right now. I'm still committed to what I said about us.\n\nME: And so am I. I still see it as temporary until you say it's not. I am still ok with waiting until you figure out what's wrong. I am still committed to figuring out a solution to that when it comes up. I will still be honest and tell you what wouldn't work from my perspective and work on an alternative, if it comes to that.\n\nME: I don't care how long I have to wait. Just know that I'm here, that I love you, and that I'm working on myself in the meantime, so that I can be someone that I'm proud of, as well as someone you're proud of.\n\nME: I also know that I couldn't be the person that I want to be if I didn't try. Not with the way I feel about you.\n*******\n\nNote: This is the second time I gave him the chance to tell me the break was permanent, and he didn't. \n\nToday: Emailed my lawyer to find out the status on my divorce. I avoided my ISFJ all day at work. Around 1 PM got an email back from the lawyer saying something along the lines of "Oh, sorry, I checked online and your divorce has been finalized since Dec 21, no idea why they didn't send me the paperwork, let me contact a clerk in the courthouse)." Forwarded it to my ISFJ. His response around 8 PM was " Man, what a fucking tease. Hopefully this is all good." Went to a martial arts studio nearby and checked out some classes. Signed up for an intro month. Went to the sushi place again and messaged him through hangouts again: \n************\n\nME: In response to your email, I think it is.\n\nME: I just signed up for a 1 month intro special at a martial arts place around here too\n\nHIM: that's good. Did you go check them out first?\n\nME: Yeah, I watched 2 of their classes. I'll see after the trial. If not, there are a few in the area that I may check out\n\nHIM: kk, well I hope it goes well\n\nME: Having low carb meal at (sushi place) right now\n\nHIM: that's nice\n\nME: Fish mobile! (pic of the fishmobile in question)\n\nHIM: mmhmm. I believe there is one behind you as well\n\nME: Yup. These are not the fish I'm looking for (in reference to his nickname being Fish)\n***************\n\nExtra note: The local sushi place I was at both times was one he'd introduced me to a few months back.\n\nThoughts? Do I have a snowball's chance in hell of working things out, and if so, what is my best course of action going forward? \n\n~Same heartbroken ENTP as before
3	In the previous post, he said he gave it 2 months to feel whether the relationship still feels right, and it didn't- for J types once the decision has been made it is difficult to reverse. When you bring it up he shuts it down quickly because for him the conclusion has already been reached. I guess it may be hard to explain from his point of view because it is something he feels, not a logical answer.\n\nMy guess is that he has already made the decision but doesn't want to hurt you by ending the friendship completely, or telling you that the break is permanent.\n\nThat is just my view though, for whatever you choose to do, I wish you all the best :)
3	To be fair, we really have no idea what is going on in his head.\n\nBut he is not giving you very good indicators that he still wants to get back together. And I think if I were in this situation, if I realized I wanted to get back together I would tell you. When you bring this stuff up, he instead reminds you he does not want to talk about it.\n\nI think it is time to work on you for you (sounds like you are trying) and do not initiate messages. One you stop initiating contact, see how often he tries to get in touch with you.\n\nI think he is trying to be friendly because he does still care for you. But I think he does not want to get back together.\n\nBut, this is all coming from some random ISFJ girl who knows nothing about the guy you're talking about. I do think you should try and wait for him to send a msg first every now and then, tho.\n\nBest of luck. And remember, if he does not work out -- there are many other guys out there. It's always hard when a relationship ends because you thought it would last forever maybe (I have done that once) *but* with you time you realize that even though that one didn't work out, the next one might *really* be the one and he will be even more compatible with you, a better fit, etc. ISFJs aren't always that great to date anyways (at least me) -- I seem really sane until I know you well enough to let my crazy come out.
1	He gave it 2 months and still wasn't feeling it, hes not going to come up with a satisfactory  answer for "whats wrong" because he relies more heavily on feels than you do, and you can't logic him out of his own feels. 
1	Huggles you.  Time to let your Ne take over and go find the next beautiful project you guys/gals are so good at doing
6	An INTP taking an interest in an ISFJ	So, I met this person at work, she just transferred here from a different area, and immediately, she and I connected, we began lengthy conversations, shown similar ideals, and constantly making and holding eye contact. \n\nWe have recently begun to spend lots of time together, both texting and spending large quantities of time hanging out. Often spending the whole day driving around aimlessly or facing deep into stories and conversations. \n\nShe and I have both expressed that we find ourselves growing close to one another, much quicker than normally happens with us. I have definitely begun to experience deep feelings for her, and I feel as if I already have a close bond to her. She has told me many things that she says she doesn't usually let other people know, and I'm extremely honored to be the recipient of these inner feelings. \n\nI have told her that I am experiencing these feelings, and that I would like to start dating, and she has told me that she isn't ready for a relationship quite yet. And I respect her decision. I hope to eventually win her over, if such a term is correct, and I understand that it will likely take time and effort. \n\nI want to show her that I would make a good companion, as I would a friend, and I worry about making the wrong decisions or jumping to the wrong conclusions. Overall, I would just like some advice for being a good friend and eventually significant other to this person. \n\nGenerally, INTP personalities aren't very good with the more emotional aspects of other people, and I understand that ISFJ have very emotion-centric personalities. Any input would be appreciated 
8	The most rewarding relationships I've ever had in my entire life have been with INTPs.\nThe bond I've had with them has been unlike what I've experienced with any other type.\n\nINTPs are fantastic, in my opinion. I really can't speak highly enough of you folks.\nMy most recent (and longest) relationship was actually with an INTP, and while we did have some areas of conflict, I was still blissfully happy with him right up until the end, and I still think of him very fondly.\nI've only ever felt that way toward INTPs. They just hit me right in the soft spot, and it triggers all my warm and fuzzy feelings. \n\nWhen things were good between us, they were really, really good. We shared a sense of humor, we had similar life goals, there was loads of love and affection.\n\nHowever, the biggest struggle we had was with communication. I'm a very upfront person when it comes to conflict. I like to bring up my concerns immediately, and hash it out before it has a chance to fester or grow into a larger problem. He had a tendency to shut down and stonewall me during conflict, which made it extremely difficult to work through any problems. He often felt that I was attacking him personally, regardless of how hard I tried to keep it about the issue at hand.\n\nI don't know if this was due to a difference in personality type, or if it was because he had severely low self-esteem, and it was easy for him to feel unworthy of love, or a number of other possible circumstances.\n\nI do know that INTPs often have trouble understanding and expressing their emotions, and that can be frustrating for an ISFJ, because that comes very naturally for most of us. INTPs could easily grow frustrated with our sensitivity, as well. \n\nThere are most likely going to be instances where her feelings get hurt, unintentionally, by you. Everybody is different, but in my case, I sometimes was hurt by his very blunt honesty, though it was also a trait that I grew to deeply love. ISFJs are pretty sensitive people, and once we let somebody in, it's not difficult for them to hurt our feelings, especially if you're not naturally in-tune with that sort of thing. Most of us are pretty understanding about it. A genuine apology can get you a long way in forgiveness.\n\nI guess the best advice I can give you would be to just try your best to be gentle with her. Don't filter yourself too much, you should still be able to be yourself with her, but things will go more smoothly if you can try to phrase things in a gentler way than you might normally put them to other people. Try not to get frustrated if she seems irrational or overly-emotional. We use feelings to function in the world just like you guys use your logical brains, and it's going to be difficult for either of you to put yourself in the other's shoes.\n\nThe best way to navigate through this is with very open communication. If you appreciate her, tell her. If she does something that hurts or frustrates you, tell her (as gently as you can). If she does something that makes you feel happy or appreciated, tell her. If you need something from her that she isn't giving you, tell her. It's going to make it much easier on both of you, when it's direct and straightforward like that.\n\nOver the long run, ISFJs and INTPs can grow a lot from each other, and you can help develop each other's inferior functions. It can be an incredibly happy pairing, if you're both willing to work at it.\n\nAs far as winning her over goes, most of us are pretty simple that way. :) Be nice to her, compliment her occasionally. If you can observe and notice little things that other people may not, it makes us feel really special. All of the cheesy, traditionalistic methods would probably win us over pretty easily. Flowers, candy, cute pickup lines. \nI always loved the very direct, slightly awkward flirtation from INTPs. They're pretty obvious about it when they like somebody, and it's really adorable.\n\nGood luck. \nIf you need any more help, let me know. I'd be happy to help.\n\n**TL;DR** 10/10, would date an INTP again. Be nice and talk about your feelings. 
2	As an INTP who was badly burnt by an ISFJ, I urge you to proceed with caution. As HBerry has said, communication will make or break your relationship. \nThat being said go for it, carpe diem brochacho!\nLove, your INTP brother
1	Honestly this post kind of freaks me out. I'm an isfj senior in high school. Sophomore year I met an intp (we are both straight guys). And we instantly became extremely close, had a lot of close chemistry, became best friends. We both agreed that we had become close really really quickly. It feels like the only major difference here is the attraction. Yes I realize that's an oversimplification but the concept stands. \n\nAs for advice, the other person was spot on. I think you just have to stick it out and show her that you can be compassionate too. This intp friend struggled a lot in his last relationship with expressing his emotions and expressing sympathy/empathy when this was something she needed very much. Keep that in mind and try to be more expressive than you might usually be in general. \n\nI wish you the best of luck and I trust it will work out great!
9	Functions	**Dominant Si (ISXJ)**: I know how this works, how it was last week, and how I want it to be in the future. If knitting in that way helped the other person to create that scarf, I feel sure that I can do the same thing by learning the same stitch. I feel happiest when I hold tight to the things that are truly important and lasting in life, such as family, friends, and often, my faith. I find that interesting, but it doesn’t match my memories of what happened. Can you give me more details, so I can decide whether or not to accept it? I know if something or someone is different from how they used to be, and can tell you exactly what has altered. I highly value my past experiences, and find it hard to forget or move past things. I really love participating in local events, family traditions, and cultural things, because it makes me feel like I am part of a living past. I enjoy routine and like things to be predictable.\n\n**Auxiliary Fe (IXFJ)**: I know what is important to you, and can support you in it, provided it doesn’t hurt others. I’m not always comfortable taking sides. Can we talk about this and reach a compromise that keeps everyone happy? I don’t want to upset people, and I can easily fit into a group and make everyone feel wanted and involved. Your emotions can influence mine, so I am careful not to let too many people in. I want to take care of you, and protect you. You are so talented. I hope you know that, and how much I like you. I’m happy to serve, but feel better when I get how I feel off my chest and out into the open.\n\n**Tertiary Ti (IXFJ)**: I am interested in learning how to make things run more smoothly and efficiently. Please be as clear and concise in your explanation as possible, so the message isn’t lost in theatricality. I’m sorry, but I see a logical inconsistency in the statement you just made; may I point it out to you so we can talk about it? I really love thinking about my ideas (Ni) and experiences (Si), and analyzing them to see what meaning they hold for me, and why. I’m good at putting a name to what is happening around me.\n\n**Inferior Ne (ISXJ)**: I know that these two things are connected, but I’m not sure how. I’m sorry, but that idea is completely unrealistic. Can we stick to one idea, please? Hmm, the last time I thought something might happen, it happened; so maybe I can trust my intuition this time, too.\n\nSource: http://funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/cognitivefunctions
9	Just an ENFP who messed up with an ISFJ	Hello ISFJ's! I am a 17 year old ENFP male, and I've been talking to an ISFJ for awhile now, and we really hit it off well. I know I'm falling for her (admittedly a little too hard a little too fast), and I think she's falling for me (she's always wanting to talk to me on the phone and won't tell me who she has a crush on, constantly saying "You don't need to know" when I ask, with a little giggle).\n\nSo I guess I forgot to point out the fact that she lives far away from me. Very far. Hundreds of miles.\n\nBut today I messed up. I think I messed up really badly. She wanted to talk to me again like we usually do.. but I sort of pushed back a bit and resisted the idea. She was confused obviously as we have been talking a lot on the phone recently. I finally just told her I was afraid of what my parents might think if they found out I liked a girl who lived hundreds of miles away\n\n(Side note: I really don't know why I'm so afraid to tell my parents anything that has to do with relationships. I guess I'm afraid of disapproval, or disappointing them, I really don't know. All I know is this happens every time. Maybe it's an ENFP thing)\n\nI could tell she was upset by the way she was responding to me afterward. She started saying things like "I get it." and when I started to apologize because I realized I messed up horribly she shifted into saying things like "I don't like making people sad either, I understand." and "It's okay it happens a lot"\n\nI knew it was too late to backtrack at this point.. and when I asked if she wanted to talk anyway she shrugged it off saying she "didn't really want to anymore." I asked if she was sad or frustrated with me (obvious question I know) and she said she didn't know. I asked if she wanted me to leave her alone for awhile, and she said yes which really started to worry me. She said she hoped to talk to me "in an hour or something" but I don't know what will happen, and I don't know the extend of the damage I've done.\n\nI'm kind of desperate for advice and feedback if anyone has any. Will she still like me? Is it over? What should I do to make sure she's okay, because that's what I want more than anything. I just want her to be okay. Even if that means she stops being with me.
6	I (ISFJ) can be easily hurt but I am very forgiving if it is some one I like a lot. Reiterate that you still like her and make sure it is genuine. She might be kind of insecure talking to you from now on. Although I can forgive people, I never forget the falling out.
3	Just give her some time to feel better, and approach and sincerely apologize later. Maybe you two should work out a time table for talking? 
1	Right I'm gonna be blunt here, you are 17, move on and find another SO.  Right now for the less blunt part.\n\nMy son's mother is an ISFJ  and she gets butt hurt easily and its visible for everyone to see, also she can be very stand offish and extremely defensive afterwards too. unfortunately, there is only 2 options, wait and see (which is never an option for an Ne dom, Our minds just work way too fast for this) or Move on. Due to having a child with her, I have no option but to move on in a slightly different way, ie.e wait for her to come around and then talk it all out, but during this time I'm away chasing butterflies and unicorn in cloud land (basically doing things to keep myself occupied)
9	ISFJ and INFJ video	Check out my newest project--youtube series of different MBTI pairings. This video is with my ISFJ friend.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Daf7MBdJUG8\n\nQuestions, comments, radically different perspectives? I want to make this true to life. If you have ideas for future videos or would like to be in one you should let me know. I find you guys to be some of the kindest creatures on the planet.  :-)\n\n
12	Female ENTP Trying to Figure out What Went Wrong With Male ISFJ - HELP	(My apologies for the length, I felt it may allow you to give better insight) Me: 30 yrs old, about to turn 31 mid year, My (former?) ISFJ: 28 yrs old as of the beginning of this year\n\nBackground: Before I met my ISFJ, I was married for 6 years to an INTP. I supported the guy for the last 4 years of the marriage. Within the last year he was adamant about having an open marriage, and within the last few months, wanting his own place. In the last several months my ISFJ noticed me at work and started coming to my desk to talk fairly often. I had given up on my last attempts to salvage things in my marriage when I decided to separate and live with a friend temporarily. My ISFJ pursued me, even though I was afraid it would be too much for him, and despite my "better judgement" at the time we started dating (April 2015). He asked me to move in with him (at the 1 and a half month mark) when my plans for a new place with a new roommate fell through. He helped me find a divorce lawyer, and I've been waiting for said divorce to finalize since last June (2015). He had me meet his parents and sister around the same time. He even was fine with me bringing my 3 cats along into his tiny studio apt. It didn't take long for me to fall head over heels. In the past I'd always been the one providing, and I couldn't help not only be seriously attracted to him for his other attributes (smart, funny, witty, can always make me smile, similarities in taste: music, movies, shows, books, foreign cultures, you name it), but also appreciate all the small things that he would do to show how much he cared. \n\nThings seemed great, and both of us got large responsibilities at work (still working for the same company), on different projects. There was still stress on my end since my soon to be ex husband (now back in CT with his parents) would frequently text me novellas trying to get back together and convince me to stop the divorce (he still does this now).\n\nFast forward to November and the first signs that something was up: One of my cats had been fairly active at night, and my ISFJ is a light sleeper. It turns out that he'd barely been sleeping at night because of it. He of course didn't tell me this until 7 months had passed. I decided to send said cat (which I'd had since he was born and would never have contemplated doing for someone else) to my parents (who'd just lost one of their 3) because I wanted to make sure he was ok and less stressed. Arrangements were made for the cat to fly back to NYC right before Christmas. \n\nFast Forward to December 2015: a week before Christmas we had our company holiday party at a nearby bar, with a 1920s theme. I'd been trying to buy new clothes recently since my ISFJ kept mentioning how it would be nice to see me in something other than jeans, sneakers and my geeky t-shirts (he always would dress fairly stylish unless he was particularly stressed or tired that day). I found a cute dress, headband and some high heels (which I almost never wear - these were the highest I've owned). Cue the music at the bar with a Daft Punk song coupled with my accident proneness, and in my exuberance to find one of my female coworkers that I'd dance with at the company parties, I managed to do a tumble and ankle twist. For a good portion of the rest of the evening I pretty much drank the pain away. My ISFJ had been semi-scarce the entire party and found me towards the end to tell me that he and a few other co-workers were going to go back to the office to play games, and invited me with. I emphasized that I didn't know if I would be able to make it in my heels and ankle, and that I'd wait for him at the bar with a few other co-workers (and their friends) that were straggling. Another coworker was wasted, decided he'd force everyone to take shots. By that time most people cleared out ( a few hours later), I realized I was a bit over my head in alcohol and was creeped out by a guy that generally kept trying to talk to me and look down my cleavage. I meandered to a chair next to the bouncer, trying to think clearly and texted my ISFJ to find out how much longer he'd be or if I should take a cab back home. He said he was having fun, and that I should catch a cab. I don't remember what I texted back, but he said to stay put and in some time came to pick me up and called us both a cab. He took me home, put me to bed, and started writing about how he didn't like what happened that night, that he needed time to think and was going over to a co-worker's. He left, and him shutting the door woke me up. I saw the note on the pillow next to me and freaked out. I called him, and we had a bit of an argument. I asked him if I should move out, and he said yes. I cried and managed to fall asleep 3 hours later. He got back sometime the next morning, not having been able to sleep at his friend's because of a loud radiator. He wanted to break up. I confronted him as to why and he said that I was the most amazing person he's ever been with, but that the very things that attracted him to me in the first place were some of the things that sometimes irritated him. He said there were tiny things that irritated him and he knew it wasn't rational. I asked if he still loved me, and he said yes.  I pressed on to find out what those issues were. He mentioned how he felt that he needed quiet time to recharge. I was surprised and said "Why didn't you say so when you were first bothered by that? I can easily go hang out with people while you're home so that you can have that". He said he didn't feel right asking me to change things that he thought were intrinsic to my personality, and I told him that he should be able to trust in me enough to tell me what he was irritated by, and that he should trust that I could determine whether it was in issue or not. He agreed to that. I then asked him if he was still attracted to me, and he said that I was out of shape and so was he (due to the stress at work and not having a chance to work out for several months), and him being that way made him more critical of me being that way. He also said that he thought my breasts could be a bit perkier, to which I mentioned: gravity and that it was a shallow statement. We both cried and made up, but he was still adamant that even though we were still together, I find a different place. I lucked out and found one in my budget within 2 weeks (former co-worker that was moving had a shared 2 bedroom under rent control), but they wouldn't take my 2 cats. I found a co-worker that would take them long term, but wouldn't be able to until February. I got my keys on Dec 28, and was going to move the first week of Jan, but got severely sick and he insisted I wait with the move until I got better. \n\nJanuary 2016: I was sick for a week (102 fever for the first several days, with a lingering cough from hell for the next 3 weeks). Work got more stressful. We had events lined up every weekend. He finally asked me when I was going to move out, and I had thought we were going to wait until my cough subsisted, and then wait out his birthday weekend, plus our friend taking the cats (since my ISFJ expressed strong dislike at the idea of ever doing the litterbox). After some discussion I thought we'd clarified our misunderstandings, and I got a UHaul. He said not to worry about the cats, he'd take care of them, and helped me move most of my stuff over. Birthday week happened, I spent most nights at the new place, with only 3 nights at his as I slowly moved more of my stuff over for the next 2 weeks (into Feb). He seemed calmer and more grounded, more loving. He was still stressed out since he got another promotion at work and now realized he was responsible for a larger team and the entire technical debt of our flagship app. Meanwhile I'd been stressing out on the new app that I'd been placed on as the infrastructure technical lead (and with the exception of 2 team mates being lent to me for a sprint, the only engineer). Our deadlines on it kept shifting back and forth, so I was frazzled in terms of whether or not we could ship it.\n\nFeb 2016: We got our bonuses. He found out he finally got a raise with his promotion. Not as big as he'd hoped, and felt under appreciated. I got a raise as well, and we realized that I still make a larger salary. The friend that was going to take the cats started to date someone that is extremely allergic and said he couldn't take them anymore. The week after, talk of deadlines shifting on my project happened again, and people got shuffled again (as they have been twice in the past 8 months). Word came through that the board was upset that they'd been told one date and not another. I got pulled off and a new-comer to my team (that started on Monday) got put as a technical lead to "change perception". My ISFJ was furious and thinks I'm being scapegoated. My team has been scrambling to gather evidence on my behalf (which has been surprising and humbling). Saturday (Feb 13th) we went to our regular DnD game which we've been in since last year. We had fun, and he drove me back to my place. He said he wanted to talk. I asked him if he wanted to come in, and he said no, that he didn't want it to take that long, but that we should take a walk. He broke up with me. I asked him why and he said that he couldn't give a logical answer. I told him I wanted an answer and that it didn't have to be logical. I asked him if he still loves me. He said he does, but that the relationship just feels wrong. I asked him if it ever felt right, and he said that yes, it felt very right at the beginning, but at this point it doesn't, and he doesn't want to go into more detail. He said he gave it 2 months since our talk in December, and he still doesn't feel it's right. He left, and I cried and talked to my roommate. She decided that we should just bring the cats, come what may, and so I texted him to let him know. Feb 14 (Valentine's Day): we went over in the morning and brought the cats and the last of my stuff. He helped bring some of it over. I gave him his keys back. I asked him for a talk. I told him that I would like to know, when he can tell me, what he thinks I did wrong, that I would like some feedback. He told me that he's already committed to sorting it out, writing it down and sending it over to me in a month, but to understand that it would just be a snapshot of how he feels at this time. I asked him for a hug and told him that for what it's worth, I still love him and I hope he finds happiness, whether or not it's with me. He said he wished me the same, hugged me and left.\n\nI feel like my heart is breaking. I don't know what to do. Could someone with an ISFJ perspective help shed some light on what went wrong? What I might have done wrong? I really just want to work things out with him, but I don't know if it's too late already.\n\nThank you for reading this, and for any advice forthcoming.\n~ One heartbroken ENTP
4	Honestly, it doesn't sound so much like you did anything wrong, as much as it sounds like you just have incompatible personalities.\n\nI absolutely *adore* xNTP types. You guys are the best. However, ENTPs are challenging for me to be around for long periods of time, and living with one would probably be a mess, for me.\n\nMy brother is an ENTP, and I lived with him for 16 years, until he moved out. He's an awesome person, and I love him, but we function so differently, I couldn't stand living with him. All of the things that made him fun and exciting to be around were also things that drained and frustrated me.\n\nI don't think this is something that either of you could really fix or change. It sounds like he really loves you, but your differences are just too big for him to stay with you.\n\nISFJs typically won't give up on a relationship unless they know for sure that they can't make it work. Obviously it's going to vary a lot depending on the person, but I myself would never pursue an ENTP, solely because I know that they would be challenging for me to live with, and eventually the traits in them that I find myself drawn to would be the very traits that would make me resent them later on. \n\nENTPs are extremely exciting, charming, funny, ambitious, outgoing and eccentric. They're one of the few extroverted types that I feel complete adoration for. But I need a lot of quiet time, and as exciting as ENTPs are, I would personally prefer a partner who is very calm, mellow and quiet, which is why I'm usually more drawn to INTPs, as I've found them to be a better fit.\n\nThis doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you, and I really don't think you've done anything wrong. ENTPs really are lovely people, and plenty of ISFJs have happy, healthy relationships with them. But I know I could never do it, and it sounds like your ISFJ feels the same way. It's just a matter of compatibility.\n\nIf it's any consolation, he probably still holds deep affection for you, and he probably still views you with great admiration. In my experience, when an ISFJ loves somebody, unless they do something to totally betray us (and even then, plenty of us make exceptions for that sort of behavior), that love is always there. \n\nI'm sorry things couldn't work out between you two, and I sincerely hope you have better luck in future relationships. 
3	INTP here, hanging out in ISFJ because I've had THREE relationships with ISFJs that have ended pretty much like that, and I seek similar understanding. I've never felt so loved, *and* so much anger and frustration, as I have with my ISFJ exes.\n\nThank you for sharing your story the way you did. I really appreciate the level of detail and investment in making sure your tale was completely understood by those that take the time to read it, and a lot of the details strike a chord with me and my experiences.\n\nI'm also sorry your other INTP seems to have been such a lazy, clingy little shit. I think perhaps the older we get, the more we have opportunity to develop Si and Fe, and the better we get.
1	I'm so sorry for how heartbroken you're feeling. Well his comment about your breasts stuck out to me (maybe because I'm insecure about mine not being as perky). You can change weight gain but you can't change that. Perhaps that relates to things you can't change in your personality and he doesn't want you to. I've been in some friendships where I've had great times with the person but in the end something didn't click and I couldn't explain it but couldn't keep hanging out with that person. I've never been through a break up like this but I believe that if something is meant to be then it will be and I hope you find that person you're meant to be with.
6	ISFJs, you probabily know from first hand experience that most descriptions of Si-types suck. What is the best ISFJ description you've found?	What description have you found that nails down the ISFJ type without being influenced by Intuitive bias? ENTP here.
4	http://www.16personalities.com/isfj-personality\nJust found this. Felt it was pretty accurate. 
3	[If you account for poor translation, I liked this enough.](http://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Stratievskaya_SEI)
1	I just found this thing, but it describes experiences that I've definitely had, like seeing someone or something and that bringing up something from my memory so strongly it warranted an actual response. I generally keep from "blurting" things out, but when ever this happens I often feel it's worth sharing the experience with those around me, especially if I think they might be able to share that experience or clarify it... Or even just help me nail it down.  \n\nSo... This [thing](http://www.cognitiveprocesses.com/Cognitive-Functions/Introverted-Sensing.cfm)\n\nTo be honest though, the 16 personalities website is pretty spot on from everything I've read. One cool site I found in the past was the respective "hells" for each type. Should just be a short Google away. \n\nSauce: Isfj, at your service.
7	[Master Personality Typology Survey] I'm conducting a survey to analyze correlations between popular personality typologies, and I need a lot more ISFJs in it!	
5	Are any of you firefighters?	If so, do you feel like your personality traits as an ISFJ help you excel at what you do? Do some of them hurt your ability to excel? I'd like your thoughts in general on being an ISFJ firefighter.\n\nI'm an ISFJ considering a career change, and firefighting has been something which has really appealed to me. Although, at this point changing careers would be a pretty big deal (At least in my mind), so I'm trying to find every and any bit of information which can help me make the right decision.
3	Hey, I was going to be a firefighter. I was working as an EMT, almost finished all my fire classes, ready to go to the academy, and had a huge change of heart. It just wasn't for me, even though I had been working towards it for 4+ years. I just didn't have the personality for it and didn't feel like I belonged. I don't know what state you are in, but in mine (CA), it is really competitive in the job market. Everybody and their mothers wants in on a fire career and since 90% of calls are medical aid, it is practically mandatory to be an EMT basic but much more helpful to be a paramedic  as well. Do some research though. Its a great career and it was hard letting go. Sometimes I think back and think "what if" but if you set your mind to it and really think that you want to do it, go full force.

6	Family reunion today: the best of times and the worst of times.....	I love my family and I am glad to see them,  but this day will exhaust my introverted side.  Any other isfj's feel this way?
3	I recently entertained my mom for her birthday. Spent pretty much the entire day with her, driving to places, eating at restaurants. So exhausted the next day I stayed in my room the entire day & basically didn't interact with anyone.
2	Yes. I love being around family but I hate being around people, lol. So at the end of the day I'm exhausted, even though I've had a good day talking and chatting with people I love.
7	Looking for career help	I'm a 29 year old guy, married.\n\nRight now I work for my cousin doing data entry very part time (no more than 15 hrs/w) my wife works part time as well (she is an ISFP.) We both enjoy working part time as it gives us a lot of quiet time together.\n\nBut I often feel bad that she works more while I sit at home and I have recently started searching for a new part time job with more hours, but I want something satisfying.\n\nwhat kind of job should I look for?\nI have a decent history in medical, which I didn't hate, but didn't like either (was a CNA, EMT, and have an expired Basic X-ray license.) I really like working with computer and have a basic talent for it. I prefer to work evenings and again part time is preferable.
1	Man, I'd love to hear any advice too.  RemindMe! 7 days
1	If you have a decent bio background as well as a love for computers I would suggest something like bioinformatics, the jobs are kind of few and far between, but it sounds like something you would love from the thirty seconds I spent reading this post :P a lot of them have potential for telecommuting as well.\nSincerely,\nRandom INFP who wandered into this sub.
5	Question about dating an isfj	Hello,\n\nI met a someone who fits the profile of an isfj on OK Cupid.\n\nWe met for a happy hour and talked for about two hours.  She was very sweet.  I'm an ENFP and something about her was so intoxicating.  She kept playing with her hair the whole time and then kind of rubbed my back as I walked her back to her car.  I felt this extremely strong flutter of electricity run through me when she did that.  Like I had just dropped straight down a roller coaster.  I was intoxicated by how beautiful she was and everything.\n\nWe got to her car and my eyes just locked on her's.  We said goodbye, and some how we were holding hands.  Then somehow we kissed.  Not french kissing, just a sweet little kiss.  There was this moment of "oh no" in her eyes right before it.  It wasn't something I planned or even thought about, it just came out from how much feeling was happening.  It's hard to explain.  To me it felt like my soul was reaching out, not my head or brain or mind or whatever, not my body or anything, just something beyond all that.\n\nAnyway, she's gone away on business for 10 days.  We've texted a few times.  Sometimes I feel abandoned and have issues with that so now that she's gone it feels kind of sad and I'm anxious.  How should I proceed?\n\nBeing kind of insecure I asked her about 3 times toward the end of our date if she wanted to do this again.  She said yes all three times.  I'm a little nervous about having to initiate a lot and don't want to get rejected.  I texted her after the date could text me anytime and she texted back I "could text her anytime too lol."  I haven't mentioned the kiss or anything like that.  Just told her to have fun on her trip.\n\nWhat's the best thing I can do now that she's gone on business for so long and I'm very curious about her still?\n\nThank you!
6	This made me feel really happy inside. My first love and serious relationship was with an ENFP so I really understand what you're describing. That electricity between you, you'll never feel that exact feeling without that match. \n\nIt sounds like you had a wonderful date c: Absolutely perfect in my opinion honestly. It's truly unfortunate that she had to leave so soon for an extended amount of time, I'm sorry you're feeling that way. She didn't abandon you, if you felt that really special something with her she probably felt it too. I know it sucks but you've really just got to find things to keep busy and try to enjoy your time between seeing her again.\n\nIt's okay to feel insecure, but I think she likes you and will definitely be seeing you again. She did say yes three times right? If you're feeling too anxious or bothered you can just text her and chat a little, just talking to her will help. I understand it's a business trip though so I don't know how her free time is. She probably won't bring up the kiss either, probably still thinking about it, reminiscing perhaps ha. \n\nThe best thing you can do is wait as patiently as you can for her to come back while expressing a caring and interest in her. I always appreciate someone checking on on me once a day and asking how I am, how my day was. Just a show of your caring and interest is nice. Remember little details about her, favourite things, take an interest in her thoughts/opinions and you'll get close in no time c: Good luck!

5	Extroverts too have problems in an introvert dominated environment	I am sorry if this sounds beyond obvious, but I just came to the realization that extroverts too have problems in enviroments dominated by introverts.\n\nFor example, my home environment is introvert dominated, in which my mom is the only extrovert - and just yesterday I noted that how much bad time she gets just because she wants to hangout/talk more with us and other friends in comparison to us.\n\nJust sharing - can't imagine what kind of replies I am going to get for this one :-P\n
6	I don't think anyone denies this. But most people here, are here because they are introverts or need to discuss introversion. Thinking about extroverts might not be very high on a priority list here.
4	This was my life as a teen. It was actually my mother as well. We're all introverts, but my mom has the most active extroversion. I think to a certain extent, silence is uncomfortable (at dinners etc.) even for introverts, especially when you're a matriarch figure looking out for the "healthiness" of the family.\n\nI myself can feel slightly uncomfortable in heavily introverted spaces, but at least I understand it. It must be excruciating for a full on extrovert. 
4	Yep, ISFJ/INTJ couple living with an ENFP and I feel terrible for him sometimes. It's so obvious how whenever we come out of the room/office he follows us wherever we go because he wants to talk/hang out. It's also kind of annoying (like if I want to cook with just my boyfriend) but I know he wants the attention etc and it makes him happy.\n\nI think that most of us are able to see when others are hurting/needing so I doubt you'll get bad responses like you think lol. We are pretty empathetic.
13	So many jerks online... how do you deal?	Obviously the best option is to not engage. But sometimes I just really want to, especially if I feel passionate about what the topic is. But even if I type up a great reply, I have to think, "Great, what if someone is mean to me after I post this because they disagree?" A long time ago I had posted about some Reddit comments that upset me, basically saying poachers should die and didn't deserve anything etc etc. And I had said I disagreed, we should hate the system not the poachers etc and I got mean comments for what I said... But I still felt passionately enough about it to comment, knowing I might get backlash. So just examples like that.\n\nRight now I have been supporting Bernie Sanders and I have been polite about who I support and don't really mention it to people IRL (too many conflicts could arise). But online, sometimes I want to comment on something someone has said and I am too scared to.\n\nAnd recently I played League of Legends and normally everything is fine but I had people telling me I sucked, to never play that champ again, that "how would I like to play with retards?" etc. I cried afterwards. How can I just not care?\n\nIs there a way to be less sensitive? Luckily people are usually pretty nice IRL but they can be so mean online and I don't want to resort to being mean back. Sometimes I try to think of a clever reply that isn't mean but doesn't make it look like I'm backing down either... But most times I just go radio silence afterwards.\n\nI am trying to remember that people don't make me feel certain ways, I can choose how I feel/react to the situation. But it's tough, because it just makes me feel faulty when I keep "choosing" to be sad over it. Or I wish I could just think "Yeah, well that person is an asshole" but I normally just think "Well, maybe they're right."
5	"I am trying to remember that people don't make me feel certain ways, I can choose how I feel/react to the situation. But it's tough, because it just makes me feel faulty when I keep "choosing" to be sad over it..."\n\nThere's an underlying layer there that not a lot of people get to. \n\nYou're *choosing* upset because being upset is important to you on some level. In that moment, it's MORE important than not being upset. \n\nDig for that second layer, examine (however briefly) why it's more important to be upset than not upset. \n\nMaybe you'll decide that it's not important to be upset, and you'll have this sort of A-HA! moment, and you'll have the ability to move past it, or at least work through it. \n\nMaybe you'll decide that it IS important to you to be upset - but you'll have considered WHY it's important. Then you can be upset guilt-free until you realize that it's not the most important thing anymore, and then you can move on with your day, or your lane, or whatever. =)\n\nSure, you can choose to be upset, and you can feel like a failure for choosing to be upset - or you can figure out what your personal motivations are, and then act with more self-knowledge and self-understanding...holding yourself up to your OWN standards, not the external standards of others. =)\n\nAlso, the League of Legends community is exactly why I still play Skyrim 5 years after release.
2	Mute button is your friend. \n\nDon't compare your beginning to someone else's end. :) instead of thinking, "I can't do anything right!" maybe think how you could have made that play differently and write it down? Be hard on the problem, soft on the person!
2	As an isfj, I'm extremely critical of the people around me, I'm not a dick out loud, but boy could I be. I generally keep it to myself and make my observations and such to save for later. When people get under my skin it's definitely rough trying to ignore that stimulus. Anyway, I have a good infj friend who pointed out to me that I can get hung up on things emotionally and internally. He told it's like I grab a stress ball and instead of pulsing with it in an exercise fashion, I just squeeze the shit out of it and don't let go. His advice was drop the stress ball. Essentially just say "fuck it." Now I don't do this very well to this day, but at least I'm aware of the fact that I cause my own stress at times by simply continuing to squeeze the ever live shit fuck outta that goddamn stress ball and once that thought crosses my mind I can drop it, or set it down, or punt the fucker, and distract myself into blissful ignorance. Also, because of same dude, I got into meditation. Basically, in my mind, I dig all the stress balls out of my backpack and set them down and just look at them, one at a time. Who ever pissed me off, who ever I'm worried is mad at me, who ever I want to get closer to, all of them... I just look at them and reflect on them. I don't touch, I don't argue, I just watch what my mind wants to see and life's gotten significantly better. I've discovered the power of playful sarcasm as a result, which is awesome. It's like our normal assholeish sarcasm, but inclusive of the people around us, they actually laugh and it's not that awkward. I've learned to face things instead of trying to choke the dickens out of my own mind dressed as a stress ball. If this has at all gotten you interested, there's some great meditation YouTube videos, for the record, fuck all the religious stuff. Have at "[fuck that meditation](http://youtu.be/dvC4Yu3ILUc)" and just calmly listen to him show you how to put the stress ball down. There's also this [guy](http://youtu.be/5GSeWdjyr1c), who's pretty good. Side not though. Why'd you go to league? That community is notoriously toxic, despite all the counter measures they've employed. I'm a dedicated league player, I know that's not a nice place for kids. (Not that you're a kid) My recommendation as a player is tear back into those assholes cause they deserve it, but as a generally nice person, just say fuck that ball of stress.
2	For me, it eventually became clear that lots of people thrive on "infallibility through anonymity" where they can say just the most awful things and remain untouchable in their soft chair, next to a bag of chips. These guys are cowards. They'll shamelessly use the internet as a crutch to boost their egos, and they have nothing to lose by being mean. \n\nIt's awesome that you don't stoop to their level. It takes courage to care, all in all, offline and online. When it's clear that someone wouldn't be so awful IRL, it's best to just put them below you. Jerks are jerks.
1	You have to disconnect yourself from League, and most online games, mentally.  Realize that everyone out there is another person in another chair.  They don't know you and anything they say about you is based on, what, 20-60 minutes of interaction with you? \n\nNot worth noting or responding to. 
1	> I am trying to remember that people don't make me feel certain ways, I can choose how I feel/react to the situation.\n\n\nIsn't it their fault if they acted the asshole and made you feel like shit, though? It strikes me as highly unfair to make someone else accountable for the words or actions of another, and most of the time, I see it as a narrative that's held up by people who want to retain their right to be an asshole without having to face consequences. Surely being an asshole is more up to choice than "choosing" to be upset. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHonestly, telling someone to just "not care" is an awful thing to say to them. If someone's said something hurtful to you, it's not a crime to have a human emotional response. It's just a human emotional response. If there were more people around who were "too" sensitive, then maybe people wouldn't have to feel this way.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nAs for things like LoL and the like, well... bear in mind that immature dickwits who can't seem to handle treating the person on the other end of the computer like an actual person because of... reasons. It's crap, but it comes with the territory. If you can, find people you know to play with, and you can cut down on the randos. \n\n\nAnd given that these types are people who use their (")prowess(") in gaming as a basis for their self-esteem/character, I wouldn't consider their approval or disapproval any kind of true statement on yours. 
1	>I am trying to remember that people don't make me feel certain ways, I can choose how I feel/react to the situation. But it's tough, because it just makes me feel faulty when I keep "choosing" to be sad over it.\n\nThis is exactly why I don't subscribe to that mentality. All I end up doing is feeling like my being upset over someone's shitty behaviour is somehow a worse failure than the other person's choice to do the shitty thing. So I instead tell myself "Don't blame yourself for other people's shitty behaviour toward you. They fucked up, not you." Not only does this stop me from feeling guilty about being upset, it also stops me from seeing that person's behaviour as a reflection on me, which is often why I was upset in the first place.
0	i found i learned to stop "caring" about certain things by learning to see emotional influence as a source of power. like if someone says something and it upsets me, that is me being swayed by their influence, thus giving them power over me. \n\ni had to learn this specifically because my parents are emotionally manipulative. they'd tell me that they are sad and upset and disappointed in me because of how much they invested in me and because of that, it's my responsibility to keep them happy by meeting their ever changing, never clearly explained expectations. \n\nthat is them trying to use their influence over me in order to attain their own goals and wishes. if i allow myself to be swayed, i am giving up my power over myself to them. if that makes sense. \n\nso after realizing that, and realizing the importance of keeping my power to control my actions and feelings to myself, i had to detach the from things i found hurtful in order to better focus on understanding the influences they have on me as well as see the person and the goals behind the words.\n\ni have aunts and uncles who live off of the feeling of being better than others. they crave it and actively talk shit and spread rumors in order to sustain their thirst. if i fail in life, they will smile. so when i meet them, and see that thirst in their eyes, and when they start talking shit and sniff around for delicious morsels of my sadness, they instead find that i choose not to react, and so they're left unquenched and unsatisfied. \n\nif i react, it means i fell to their level. like them putting out a noose and me ringing myself on it. but i don't, because i see their thirst for what it is: my power over them, to do with as I please. they need my reaction, they need to see me hurt, so in a way, they need me and what is in my power to give them. and i don't give it to them.\n\nannnd that's how i figured it out. i don't know if it works for everyone. took years to piece that together and even now i'm not perfect. but yeah, detach to understand how things effect you and why they were said or how the things said are being used.\n\ni think the focus shouldn't be on "i am unable to keep myself from being sad" as much as it should be "let me try to keep as  clear a mind as i can to better understand what's going on in myself and what's going on in this situation". because being able to stay clear headed to understand stuff is an active thing you can want to do and work to improve as opposed to a doomed to fail setup of "just choose not to be sad".

4	Company assigning employees to teams based on their personality?	Back when i was in college and as part of their recruitment process, I took a personality test before getting an offer letter from a company. There was no result or description of my personality after the test completed - the results were just sent to the company \n\nAnyhow, now I have reasons to believe that the company divides it's employees into teams based on the test results. \n\n(i)There were two sides to the office - one was a lot smaller than the other, I was in the smaller side. \n\n(ii)Now that I look back, 100% of the interns on the smaller side were introverts - that number is about 70-80% for other employees. \n\n(iii) R&D department was on the smaller side along with two other teams and Susan Cain has mentioned t in her book hat companies fill their R&D departments with introverts. \n\n(iv) All the events (eg. Fun Friday) were organized on the bigger side - it was optional for everyone - but since we were in the other side, it was easier for us to concentrate on our work.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?
2	Sounds like a *very* silly company to work for.
2	I guess that is a pretty neat way to distribute interns since they clearly don't care about each person's aptitude (which I sort of understand, college students aren't very skilled and experienced yet). I think they wouldn't use this technique when hiring actual employees. \n\nPersonally, I don't like thinking that my personality is possibly more important than my work, but I get it. The company values "office harmony" \n\n
15	Do you have a lot of acquaintances/small friendships?	A common thing about ISFJs is that we have very few real close friends but we get very attached to those.\n\nThat said, do you also tend to have a lot of acquaintances or people that you are in good terms with and can have small conversations when you meet (whether online or in real life?)\n\nI only have a small group of really close friends but I feel like I have a lot of acquaintances whether it's through facebook or random other online forums.
5	Yes, this is definitely true for me.\nI have a few people in my life that I value tremendously, and I can really open up to them. It's a small circle, but they're very important to me.\n\nOn the flip side, I have a fairly large pool of people I'm friendly with, but I'm not very close to them. I enjoy hanging out with them, but it's more shallow and distant, and while I enjoy their company, I don't really go into anything deep with them, and most of them could probably fade out of my life and I wouldn't be particularly upset.
2	Yup, definitely true for me. I have a ton of acquaintances. And with most of them when we get together it feels like we're close friends. Then I have maybe one friend who I'm incredibly close with and am always talking to.
1	I'm kind of the opposite. I have a small group of 7 people who I interact somewhat regularly with and think of as friends, but no real close friends. Outside of those 7 people I really don't have anyone.
1	yes. small group of close friends. large group of people i'm on friendly terms with.
1	Yes , I have 2 best friends I've known since childhood , but I do have co-workers that we keep in touch from time to time and I care for them deeply , same goes for online friends 
7	My wife is a ISFJ and I'm a INTP - How can I be a better husband?	Her love language is Acts of Service
11	Same here. I would love to hear ISFJ perspective on this, but here's mine:\n\nTake notes about some of the chores that she does every day. Does she make the bed every morning? Is she incredibly picky about how it is made? Learn how she likes it done and then do it for her. She will appreciate it.\n\nIs she always the one to clear the dishes from the dish drainer? Put an alarm on your phone to remind yourself to do it for her.\n\nDoes she waffle on decision-making because her specialty is implementation and not theory? Go ahead and give a strong, clear opinion about what you think is best.\n\nDoes she hog all the sheets at night? Sorry, can't help you with that.
6	isfj AND adhd	I was wondering if there are any ISFJs with ADHD. I am an ISFJ with ADHD. any comments would be most helpful.
1	I'm an ISFJ and I've had adhd for years. It was more apparent when I was still in school but it's not so bad at work. \n\n\n\n
1	I feel like I may have ADHD and am am isfj, but I also am being treated for anxiety and the two teams to have similar symptoms. 
1	My grandma has it and she's an isfj.  Her motto is, "A place for everything and everything in its place."  It seems to work for her.  She's 91 and still drives. :)
1	Yeah! And I have dyslexia
7	How long will you stay?	To clarify since the title isn't very specific I'm referring to how long will you stay with someone you love (whether it be a friend or partner) even if it's not a smooth ride. Being an ISFJ to me means that I'm loyal to the end. But as I'm growing and learning I am coming to understand that I simply cannot hang on to everything. Letting people go is incredibly hard for me, the people that really matter to me, the ones I love and care very deeply for. So, how long will you stay and try your hardest to make things work before you call it quits? What makes you call it quits, what really draws that line? 
6	In my past relationships, I've stayed to the point where the person breaks up with me. It does a lot to me psychologically, but I try to see the best in people and do it in the hopes that person will change, but I've learned that they never do. They have to want to change and there is nothing I can do about it.  
7	I'm very stubborn in this way.\nHonestly, if I really love them, I'll stay until the very end, or until they end up leaving me.\n\nIt may not be a functional or healthy trait, but I just can't bring myself to walk away from someone I love.
5	I think I stay as long as I feel the other person is trying just as hard as I am to make things work. If I feel like the other person's not pulling his weight or isn't making me a priority, I leave. 
5	In my first relationship, it was my online friends at the time telling me that he was bad for me, they loved me and would be there for me no matter what. Knowing I wouldn't be alone if I left, and hearing people I loved telling me they were concerned... that is what really made me start to wonder. Even in the end (at the time), I thought I was the "wrong" one for leaving. Now, I am fucking disgusted with who he was and what he did to me. So abuse and knowing I had a support network helped me draw the line.\n\nIn my second relationship, it ended mostly because my feelings were never respected. Also there was a distance issue. But I still talk to him and we are still friendly--but every now and then he just really pisses me off. I tell him a lot, "I love you but I hate you sometimes." So I quit the relationship but I did not have to let him go. But I would say a lack of respect (of my feelings) is mostly what drew the line for that one, and the distance was difficult.\n\nSome of my friends, I have been too quick to let go of over perceived slights. I wish I had not acted when I was upset. Then again, all I did was unfriend them on FB after they hadn't talked to me in months and I had texted them a few times... so it's not like I went full psycho or something (don't want to give the wrong idea).\n\nSome of my friends, the ones who were there for me and told me they loved me -- the ride is not bumpy per se but we do not keep in contact very much any more. Don't play the same online games, etc. But when we do talk, it doesn't matter how much time has passed. I tell this to my dearest friends: "*Please*, if you ever need, do not be afraid to call me no matter the time. I will be happy to help you, and I mean it." I feel silly to remind them but I am also happy to remind them every now and then.\n\nSo that was a lot of rambling but I hope it helps somehow...
2	For me , it's till the very end , my longest relationship lasted 5 years and it was ended by him although he was very manipulative  , I was willing to go as far as he would take it , I care a lot which is my undoing , and when it was over I played ever situation in my head to figure out what I had done wrong , and it  takes  me a long time to get over someone .

7	Fellow ISFJ's, How sensitive are you towards criticism?	I have a habit of taking things way too personally and I'm trying to loosen up a bit. Any of you have this problem? if so, how do you cope?
4	I used to really take criticism hard...then I went through art school. I think the biggest thing for me was figuring out how to use the criticism. I look for any way I can to improve on what's being put down. Of course, I still take it personally sometimes, but I use that offended(ish) feeling as motivation to do better.
2	I am having to work through this myself, over the last year I've been working on taking things less personally. I've had to kind of almost train myself to think before reacting. I think about the criticism (or anything else that upsets me for that matter, rude people, an odd tone a friend uses, etc), and first think about where it is coming from. \n\nIs it true that it is something I need to work on? If so, I'm good at beating myself up, so I have to tell myself that it's okay, and that I should be thankful that they pointed it out so I can work harder on it (even though it sucks to be confronted with something like that).\n\nIf i think it is coming from a place without good intentions, like someone being hard on me for something that isn't true, or just trying to get under my skin, I have to make myself realize that it's not me, it's about them. They are having a bad day, or going through something personal that is causing them to want to be a dick for no other reason.\n\nIt's taken months to develop the mindfulness to remember to think before reacting, but it's made a huge difference in my life and relationships. 
2	I am really bad at taking it personally. I have some ni-dom friends though and they are helping me realize that even if I think what they said was "mean" (because they don't always phrase things super tactfully) they are only trying to help because they are my friends and would not want to upset me. Some people are just able to give and get constructive criticism really well. I am not one of them but if I can see their motive for giving it (aka to help me) then I try to get over my hurt feelings.\n\nHowever if it is someone I do not know giving me criticism it is much more difficult to accept. Someone the other day told me "you should have done this instead of that blah blah" and I thought in my head "whatever" but if they had instead phrased it "have you ever considered trying x instead of y? I heard it works really well" I would have been much more open to the suggestion. Same thing being said to me more or less, but the latter I can accept much more easily.
1	Well, first of all, for me it depends on who is criticizing me. A lot of people that might criticize me, are people that I don't really care about their opinions, but I still feel like they could be right, which is how I try to learn from it. I kind of just make all criticism into a joke as well. \n\n"Honestly, you should care more about your appearance"\n\n"Why? Are you into me or something?"\n\n"You're a fucking weirdo"\n\n"But I'm your weirdo"\n\n"Gay"\n\n"For you"\n\nI dont know this was a really bad example, but you get the point, or at least, I hope so\n\n
1	Very very few people's criticisms of me bother me. However this is the 37-year-old me talking. When I was younger, I was very bothered by criticism and tried to "fix" their perception of me. And it was only people who I felt "should" support me (my mother in law, best friends) that it bothered me. I've had to slowly develop a "Who cares about what people think." attitude otherwise it would eat me alive. I had a really difficult time with my mother in law as she criticizes EVERYONE. I had to really gain a sense of strong self and say, "Who cares?" and if I felt she was such a critical person, why did I even care what her opinion of me was? It was never going to be good enough. Thankfully she has softened and I have forgiven.
4	Hi there, people ! I'm hear to discuss the idea of a Quadrant chat !	In Jungian theory, types are divided into 4 Quadrants : Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta.\n\nNTPs and SFJs form the Alpha quadrant : We all use consciously Ti Ne Si and Fe functions.\n\n[Someone](/u/Hayarotle) on /r/entp thought about [making a chat for the Alpha quadrant](/r/entp/40jlg0/).\n\nSo :\n\n * What do you think of that ?\n\n * Do you want to make it real and chat a bit ?\n\n * Which chat system you prefer ? (Discord, IRC, something else ?)\n \n * Can you bring some ESFJs with you ? (NTPs are not people I would qualify "difficult to find". =) )\n\nIn any case, have a nice day ! Cheers !
2	Groupme's app is amazing, but it does require a cell phone number. I'd be interested to join as well!
1	Anyone interested in joining a new MBTI subreddit?	I started up a new subreddit a while back and am looking to get it active.  It'll be a good place to chat about anything MBTI, learn your type, or meet people of another type.  /r/mbtichat if anyone is interested.
12	ISFJ's: listening and talking	I've been thinking about this more lately because I'm getting increasingly more bothered by it. I love to listen and learn more about people but lately I've been too far on the listening side. I enjoy listening but when the person continuously interrupts or never gives me a chance to talk I lose interest pretty fast. It hurts my feelings because I can listen for a long time but I want to be heard as well. I think of talking as a give and take, I expect to be given the same respect and attention I gave them. When I talk about something I want to be acknowledged because it's not often that I have a lot to say.  Just because I enjoy listening doesn't mean I enjoy being talked over, interrupted or told the same story repeatedly. \n\nI've only just started saying when I've been interrupted and that I'd like to finish what I was saying. I was wondering if other ISFJ's can relate to what I'm saying. I encounter this issue most often with my INFP boyfriend (or other males). Men do typically talk more that women so if there are other ISFJ females with similar situations I'd like to know how you cope or assert yourself better.
5	I'm engaged to an INFJ and he is great about making me feel heard. He feels the same way I do about wanting to listen and be heard in return. I don't think the trick is learning to assert yourself, but to surround yourself with polite people who want to listen to you and be heard in return. Those people can make you feel better about yourself and make you feel like you matter so you can have the confidence to assert yourself in other situations. Good luck!
5	INTP here, SO is ISFJ. I have the total opposite experience, where ISFJ talks on and on, and can't hear me because any lull in conversation (which I need for thinking) means that mentally my SO has moved on to thinking about the list of tasks to be done.
2	I have been in your same position -- the whole "When I talk about something I want to be acknowledged because it's not often that I have a lot to say" is a big deal to me. I hardly ever try to speak up, so when I do -- I really want to be heard. All I can say is try explaining it to the people around you. Well, I'm definitely not forward enough to share that with a random person. But after being hurt a few times in conversations with my boyfriend (INTJ), I explained to him how I felt and why and he understood and has gotten a lot better at listening to me when I start to say something.\n\nIn other cases, all I really do is smile and nod politely. It's too much work to try to get people to listen sometimes, so I will put on a very polite face while thinking of everything I want to say and then I will rant about it to my boyfriend later while he nods understandingly and affirms my side haha.
2	:-)\n\nThread makes me smile because it seems to be often the case with ISFJ (but more generally speaking, with most low-assertivity introverts).\n\nProbably happens worse when being a woman (which is not my case), because of sexist major trend throughout the world.\n\nI guess we ISFJ, happen to often interrupt persons once we're launched on a topic we're passionate about.\n\nI suggest you would go on thinking about tools (and looking on the Internet for e.g. introvert tricks to work on that, or more generally topics on "being more assertive") to help you being more balanced with that issue.\n\nWorking on being less passive-aggressive, which is a classical trait in ISFJ personalities, may also help.\n\nTraining yourself to talk louder, to have more assertive gestures/postures/attitudes (apart from having "in mind" the intention to be more assertive) could be of some help as well.\n\nDon't know if that helps, even if I'm a man ?   :-)\n\nI wish you the best.
1	My housemate is INFP, I find that she's way more quiet that I am. When I'm comfortable, I love talking, but I also love hearing other people's stories and listening to them talk. I find listening more relaxing, and I tend to talk more when I'm excited. \n\nWhen I think someone is talking a lot I tend to relate the topic back to something that has happened to me or someone I know in the past (typical ISFJ haha). Alternatively, I may try to change the conversation into a topic that I am able to converse a bit more about (Ne). 
3	ISFJ performing artist job change	In the past several days I found out about personality types and also that I'm a pronounced ISFJ. Needless to say, I spend hours researching the topic and what I found revealed that what I have been doing for the bast 25 years is probably the worst profession I could have picked. I'm a performing musician who works in academia, and deals constantly with lots of projects at the same time (which leaves me frustrated that I cannot finish well any of them at a single point), complete job insecurity (yet I've always put personal and financial security hight on my priorities' list), needs to react right away to feedback (and often feels frazzled and stressed to do so, which lowers my usually punctual performance), is extremely self-critical, yet utterly loyal and supportive to everyone else, takes the constant criticism I receive personally (if you're a person and I'm a person, then it's personal), and don't feel appreciated for my work, on top of not being able to see any tangible result of said work (because performance is such a fleeting, time-defined event, that leaves no evidence, except a recording that I do not think is good enough anyway). Now I see why it took me so long to realize all of this - I was looking at every single tree in the forest and excelling at it, and missed the fact that I don't even like this forest at all! \n\nThe question is what to do next..There are plenty of things I love about music and performing - friends that are colleagues, with whom to play, the storytelling aspect of performance, seeing your efforts touch an audience member/s, the afterparties. Yet I hate having to juggle multiple projects, being paid minimally for them, not getting to experience the laurels of the work, and the philosophy of "you're only as good as your last performance", which rules my current job description. You're as good as everything you've ever done up until here, and if you happen to have a shitty day and not everything in a performance is perfect, no one will die because of it. It's not brain surgery. \n\nWhat would you advise? Stay within the field but change direction (music administration? Outreach program organization?) or get an associate degree in accounting (although I make numerous mistakes with numbers?.. Yet apparently most jobs for ISFJs are in Medicine (too late for me and too messy), Accounting (I don't have the ISFJ's affinity to number crunching), and Business (I don't like lying and deceiving for the sake of profit). I'm really trying to find a career that would cater to my strengths - being very organized and focused worker, responsible, loyal, tactile, facility with languages, writing, desire to learn a skill very well and then excel at its application (I'm a little reluctant to learning new things when I don't see their practical application. I get tired when constantly bombarded with new information to process, which I understand is a major human and character flaw, since everyone says life is constant learning and change)\n\nAny ideas would be greatly appreciated! \nThank you for reading until the end! \n
7	I just want to say: don't let your typing as ISFJ dictate your career. If you have been feeling stressed with your job and unable to to figure out why, and MBTI has helped you see your traits in contrast with the demands of your field--that's great. But please don't feel you have to drop everything and become an accountant because the MBTI said so. \n\nYou said you only found out about MBTI a few days ago, so take a while to sit back and think. Figure out how you really feel about your field and if there are ways you can change or manage the things that stress you and cultivate what you feel like it's lacking. I say this because I'm a stay at home artist, which is definitely not at the top of any ISFJ career list, and while some things don't mesh well I'm also passionate about what I do and would hate to give it up for a different job. Maybe I would be happier working in a library (I've considered it before) but I'm content with myself right now.\n\nI unfortunately don't have more advice as to what direction to look at if you decide you do want to jump ship. Good luck though, and remember that you are you, not a type description, and you shouldn't let MBTI rule you whatever you decide (even if it can have some great advice sometimes).
1	It's good to use your type as a stepping stone rather than an outright definition of you. That being said, you do seem to really enjoy music just not the stress of projects.\n\nHave you considered teaching music lessons? You could set your own schedule, choose who you'll accept to teach, no performing required other than to guide the student(s). You'd also clearly see the effect you're having as the student learns more and more and becomes better. Other options are working backstage for music performances if you'd be into that.\n\nBest of luck to you. 
3	Hey guys, what does your handwriting look like?	"Wait a minute, this doesn't belong here!"\n\nOn the contrary, yes it does! I'm conducting an experiment to see if there is any correlation between the types and their handwritings. They say that handwriting is one of the keys to your personality since your brain controls your hand right?\n\nAnyways, I would really appreciate some samples! Thanks! Don't forget to mention your type (if you are a person lurking on another type's sub of course!)

22	The ISFJ: Sex, Dating, and Love	
2	Wow, I don't know about y'all but this could not have been more accurate for me! I just love reading articles like this that put everything into perspective. Thanks for posting, OP! :)
2	Good text in general, but I don't like the emphasis on tradition. I think ISFJs often look more traditional because it is the path of least resistance, and the one that seems the most secure on the long term, it's where our Si naturally leads us. But I felt, from a couple of ISFJs I met, that they yearned for somebody to help them out of that path that is, and they where all more or less aware of it, boring and not self fulfilling. It's important to realize that an ISFJ can be the caring, providing, etc. person it wants to be out of the traditional life of housewife/provider of the family.
7	Hello!!	I have recently found I am an Isfj (thanks psychiatrist!) Might I ask what that really entails? How well do we mesh with others? How do we mesh with other isfj's?

4	Dating Advice Req: How do I change my approach? [Xpost to r/INTJ, r/ISFJ]	Hello all,\n\nI (an INTJ female) have liked this individual who works at my office (an ISFJ male) for quite some time. I've asked him for coffee once but he declined my request, stating that he didn't want to have a work-related conflict of interest.\n\nI'm wondering if I was too direct in my request. I'd still like to get to know him and see if a friendship develops, but I'm stumped on how to go forward. How can I approach this from a different angle?\n\nThanks in advance babes
9	That doesn't sound like you were too direct, but he's clearly not interested. Pursuing a friendship at this point would likely be awkward, as you've already made it clear that you like him as more than "just a friend."\n\nI would count my losses and move on, personally.
2	XPost Subreddit Link: /r/INTJ /r/ISFJ \n\nOriginal post: https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/3xivam/dating_advice_req_how_do_i_change_my_approach/
1	Could be too direct, maybe caught him off guard. I would say try to keep it casual as friends for now, maybe try to engage with him more at work when it's appropriate, like maybe have lunch together, something like that. Invite him to do something (and clearly express that it is as friends only) outside of work sometime in the future after he's more comfortable with you. I dunno, tricky situation, ISFJ often like to follow the rules and dislike potential confrontation, so he may consider the whole thing off limits, hard to say tbh. Edited to add: If he keeps giving you excuses, he may not be interested but does not want to tell you directly. In that case, I agree with the other commenter that it's probably best to move on. Good luck!
7	Why does /r/INFJ, the least common type, have 7x the subscribers of /r/ISFJ, the most common?	Is it that INFJs are better at unifying? Or they don't care for anonymity as much as ISFJs? Or maybe INFJs are recruiting ISFJs to build up their numbers! Whatever the case, any thoughts are welcome!
16	Probably because those with a sensing function high in their stack (as opposed to intuition) are more likely to focus on the concrete, physical reality. As a result, they are usually more pragmatic and less inclined to theorise and entertain abstract thoughts on the internet.
11	I'm sure mistyping and general type bias also plays some part. Intuitive profiles tend to be much more flattering and interesting than sensor ones. (I thought I was INFP for years because I was quirky and interested in more than just baking and popular shows so I had to be an N type, haha).
6	If you are part or a smaller/rarer group, isn't it more logical you'd be seeking out others more actively by joining a group?
6	I think all the ISFJs are on Facebook, lol. The ISFJ groups there have TONS of us. 
4	I feel it's 1) a matter of some people mistyping as INFJs (and other types too).\n\n2) ISFJs are the most common in the *world*, but not on Reddit. I can see a lot of ISFJs liking the cute subreddits or subreddits devoted to their hobbies, but we aren't much for Internet arguing. I also think just a lot of people, ISFJs included, don't realize mbti exists and so they never try to look up forums about it.\n\nSo basically..... I'm sure a lot of factors are involved :P
3	Just because you're subscribed to a particular subreddit doesn't mean you're that type... they may just have people interested in what they're talking about.\n\n(Also see: mistyping).
1	 truth be told i usually visit other subreddits and see whats going on. its not often i think about this subreddit tho.lol
1	Sensors in general tend to be less interested in personality theory as a whole because it's not practical enough (Si), or stimulating enough (Se). I guarantee there are just as many of them on the internet as there are intuitives. They're just interested in different things.
3	Gift for best friend?	Hello. I came here for help since im absolutely clueless. I have absolutely no idea what should I buy to my best girl friend (notice that space) for xmas. Like...I appreciate practical gifts..But I think she loves those creative sentimental gifts...I think she is ISFJ (not sure, im not that good at those letters :P ) ..\nWhat would you buy? Any help would be really appreciated. I wasnt sure in which subreddit I should upload this. If to infp(me-male) or isfj (her). So I posted it into both :D\nAnd happy upcoming christmas holidays for all of you, wonderful people :3 
3	From personal knowledge, I would say get something that either\n1. Has a practical, everyday use\n2. Has a sentimental value (preferably something homemade)\n\nFor best results, find/make something that combines both :)\nHope this helps! And happy holidays!
2	Honestly I love hand-written cards and gifts that are meaningful yet not expensive. \n\nIf she really likes League of Legends, you could get her a cute Poro plushie (this is just an example but can be applied to a lot of stuff). If she enjoys activities, you could make her a coupon like "one free trip with me to the bowling lanes" and just make it look cute and like an actual ticket/coupon.\n\nBest of luck, as long as you put thought into it I'm sure she'll appreciate the gift you give :) Remember it's not about price but the thoughtfulness that goes into the gift (altho I can only really speak for myself). 
5	How can I (INTJ) get along better with my ISFJ mother?	I just scoured her profile on 16 Personalities and the descriptions are insanely spot-on. As a parent, my mom is incredibly thoughtful, loving and self-sacrificing. She's ALWAYS putting other people first without considering her own needs, which she often doesn't recognize as valid. Balance is generally something she struggles with: she gives too much of herself. \n\nHer emotional needs are very different from mine, in that she craves constant contact with loved ones, particularly immediate family. She needs a lot of affection and reassurance to feel happy, but this isn't something I can give to her at the level she wants - as an INTJ/possible aspie I find consistent interaction (even with family) overwhelming. \n\nIt's not so much the contact itself, but the quality and frequency of contact. She communicates on a very emotional level, while my tendency is to rationalize. She wants a high level of connection *all the time* and fixates on feelings often, which can feel draining and suffocating for me. \n\nOur communication styles are just very different: she speaks with her heart, I do with my mind. Ultimately it leaves her hurt and me frustrated, when neither of us had bad intentions to begin with. We're simply different but misunderstanding each other. \n\nSo, ISFJs...how can I make her feel loved and fulfilled given our differences while maintaining healthy boundaries? \n\nI'd really appreciate your insight - thank you for reading.
3	Can't help you much here, but as an ISFJ with an INTJ-mom, can you give *me* any advice? lol.
1	First of all, I think it's really nice that you are posting here to try to help your relationship with your mom, you're a great son. Are you familiar with the 5 Love Languages? It helped me in my relationship with my INTJ boyfriend when I realized my love language is words of affirmation and physical touch. I thought he didn't love me because he wasn't as good at telling me how he felt or being overly affectionate. When I found out he expresses love with Acts of Service, and I thought of all the times he helps me (daily), and other people, I realized he was a very loving person. Perhaps if you could show your mother the differences between love languages, it might help her understand that you love her, but just express things differently. It could help her not take things so personally. I know it is hard with our types not sharing any functions at all to understand each other. I hope you guys can find a way to compromise that works for both of you. Let me know if I can help further. 
1	Perhaps this piece can help: https://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/3yu7lk/isfj_the_unsung_traditionalist\n\nI am an INTJ, so I understand your frustrations. We do not understand Fe mainly because we cannot practice it, it seems quaint and prone to self-destruction, but it is essential nonetheless.
1	Does she know about her personality type? That helped the ISFJ in my life _big time_. I got her into it by showing her the Google Images results for my own type [INTJ], and then she had to know what her type was. From there it became clear to her that others just have their own needs and that can often account for any disconnects.\n\n> but this isn't something I can give to her at the level she wants\n\nI wouldn't be so sure about this. I mean, there's at least a chance that it's just your Ni talking. I believe that just about any INTJ can practice at Fe and get extremely good at it. It's not an easy function to empathize with at first (Socionics does a good job explaining why), but if you study the helpful role of Fe in society it will start to clear your internal INTJ Ni/Fi hurdles and the outline of the challenge will become more clear to your Te. That is the goal in any INTJ learning process: Get the issue out of the open and separate subjective INTJ Ni/Fi facts from objective truths.\n\nIt could be as simple as scheduling automatic emails to touch base and let your mom know you love her. (BTW Fe is very susceptible to fulfillment through slightly-clever software) Or remembering special dates. All the family births and deaths. Asking her questions about her favorite memory of [whatever] from time to time.\n\nPretty soon this all adds up like the "emotional bank account" you hear about. Boundaries become much, much easier to manage as long as you use words like "I love you and miss you but X" or "I know we talked about this and I am very sorry but for honest reason X I need to Y. Maybe it's an INTJ thing."\n\nOften a hurt ISFJ will play the blame game (see "Survival Games Personalities Play") if they don't get what they were hoping for. This and other related behavior can start to manifest to an INTJ as manipulation, dishonesty, all those Fi-breaking things. However remember that Fi is a poor response pool for INTJs and Te is really needed here to help the relationship become a successful one--just not Te directed at her, so much as Te that helps you discover specific, efficient ways in which you can fill her basic needs and establish loving boundaries.\n\nHope this helps. Sorry for any INTJ preachiness. :-)
13	INFP married to an ISFJ	 Just want to gush on my ISFJ wife of 27 years. She is absolutely the BEST I could ever want and hope for. Wedded bliss for both of us!\n\nYou ISFJ's are so lovely and dedicated with a wonderful dry sense of humor!! I could go on and on (and I will) ! Dependable, what you see is what you get, awesomely loyal...I could go on and on (and I will) ! Accurate judge of character, true blue, can do, completely trustworthy!!\n\nTake care you ISFJ's ! I love mine.
6	My best friend is an INFP. You guys are pretty great yourselves. :) Very sweet, gentle people, with ridiculous amounts of creativity and imagination. 
4	I'm a female INFP marrying a male ISFJ and we're so well-matched that it (usually) feels effortless. He's the most genuine, caring, selfless, sarcastic, loyal, intuitive person I know. I'd be interested to hear reflections from others on the female INFP male ISFJ pairing!
2	I am also with an ISFJ. He's amazing. my mom and favorite cousin are also ISFJs.  I once was told that ISFJ x INFP are not very compatible because they only have two functions in common, but I love the ISFJs in my life. We balance each other well and have fun together! :)
4	ISFJ dumping me because of my past (INFJ)	I've been talking to an ISFJ. We never started officially dating, but we were really into each other and had a great connection. \n\nDuring a conversation it came out that I had cheated on a former partner. This happened 10 years ago. However, he (ISFJ), was cheated on and my confession raised a red flag. We've been back and forth the past few days. I could tell he was bothered by it, he was barely talking to me, and twice cancelled plans we'd made to see each other. \n\nToday he told he doesn't want to continue talking. I tried to make him see that the past me isn't the same as the current me, but he couldn't be swayed. \n\nIs there anything I can do to help him realize that I'm not a cheater and that he can trust me? 
23	As an ISFJ, I don't think I would be comfortable dating somebody who cheated in the past. Especially if I had been cheated on in the past.\n\nI understand that people can sometimes change, but in my experience, it's more likely that people will repeat their old behaviors and mistakes. I'm not saying that's the case for you, but it is the case for most people. \n\nI'm a very firm believer in the quote "When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time."\n\nFor most ISFJs, cheating is one of the worst things you can do in a relationship, and most of us tend to really value fidelity. We're also usually pretty cautious people. I personally am not likely to pursue a relationship with a person unless I feel that they're "safe", and that I can trust them to be loyal and not hurt me.\n\nI applaud you for being honest about your past, but I don't think you should count on a relationship with him. Maybe he'll make an exception and give you a chance, but even then, it's likely he would have quite a wall up until you earned his trust, which might be difficult. 
11	It's likely over. Since an ISFJ's trust is so tough to earn, if it's broken they can take it very, very hard and internalize it for years if not decades. Sounds like you opened an old wound, and it sounds like he's not willing to take another chance on being hurt again.
8	Tbh, I don't even like the idea of people cheating on tests much less their significant others. So I can see the conundrum he is in. If I knew the person well enough, I might be biased enough in their favor.\n\nI think honestly it's just best to praise yourself for being honest, and move on. If you want, maybe reach out to him again in a week and see how he feels but other than that I think it would be best not to badger him. Everyone is allowed to have their own deal-breakers.
5	sounds like the scar and pain of his past never fully healed. i don't know what you can do about it if he makes up his mind though. you can only do something if he's willing to try. but the fear of hurt could be suuper strong.\n\nbest i got is if you can convince him via explaining what changed, what you learned, what you regret, etc. and if it vibes well in a way that dulls his specific fears, maybe you got a chance, maybe.
4	Personally, when I go into a relationship, I'm really serious about it and if I hear that the other person has cheated on the past, I'm gonna feel like that person isn't worth committing to and would be a waste of my time. Try lying next time :P
1	deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.6376  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/75410)
1	As an ISFJ, I'd like to add the following.\n\n\nWe ISFJs are (dominant) sensors, we use the past as a giant database. Plus as extraverted feelers, we :\n\n_collect information about others' feelings and about their ways to handle them\n\n_but are not very real-time conscious of our own feelings, and not very good at channeling them.\n\nPlus most of us ISFJs seem to take love, and constancy & honesty, veeery deeply and veeery seriously.\n\nSo, having experienced to be cheated on (personally, or seing that on relatives) for an ISFJ, makes the fact that a person has ever cheated, a VERY VERY STRONG turn-off , we sort of *can't help* feel that *at heart* as a **burning red flag alert**, you see.\n\n\nI've been cheated on several times, and this is the hardest thing most ISFJs seem to be able to deal with. Which we probably are liable to face more than some other types (because of our special ability to be used as doormats, you'll be able to find an abundant literature about that and about the reasons for that). That's what makes us very cautious about ability to cheat in potential partners (and not only for me-ISFJ).\n\nSo I understand anyone, specially ISFJ, who (maybe despite any try to avoid judging others on their past) would not fully trust ability of forming a lifetime relationship (which is quite a criteria for romantic relationship for a high amount of us ISFJs...) from a person who has cheated in the past. Yes it may be foolish, but yes it contravenes a major root of ISFJ personality system. So even once, and even 10 years ago...\n\nI fully understand what *grylliade* says : "Since an ISFJ's trust is so tough to earn, if it's broken they can take it very, very hard and internalize it for years if not decades. Sounds like you opened an old wound, and it sounds like he's not willing to take another chance on being hurt again", and what *icanteatoxtailsoup* says there: "he's also allowed to decide that this territory is too painful for him".\n\n\nYes, I firmly believe that what you did 10 years ago does not necessarily make the essential of who you are today - fortunately for all of us   :-) -, and at the same time I'd have a hard time ignoring this, this is just about the core of who I am. I guess I could ignore it, but it would take time and patience (from me *and* from a potential having-cheated-in-the-past partner) to build, eer... "extra trust" ?  :-)\n\n\nI truly applause you for being that  honest, and if this man sincerely deserves your interest, yes I believe he should overcome your 10-years-ago-cheating and at least give you a chance, if you sincerely regret it and could not imagine yourself doing that again. Otherwise I agree this could be immaturity from him. \n\nOr firm prudence, which I also, sadly, understand. \n\n\nSo I kind of understand both of you, even if I don't even imagine me cheating. Ever. In any situation.\n\n\nFinally I share with *I_prefer_chartreuse* not everything about their post but, the fact that the decision is now his call, and if he does not give you a chance, you have to move on, with some kindness on yourself.\n\n\nI'd suggest you to write him a kind and thoughtful letter/e-mail, if you feel he's worth that try, and that it could be of some use on the right path.\n\n\nWishing you the best,\n\n\n\nPY
0	Sounds like you dodged a bullet 
-1	This happened ten years ago and he's flipping out? And nothing cheating wise is going on in the present, with this current relationship?  Honey, this isn't a trait of a personality type, this is immaturity and assholery. We all make mistakes, and yes, the past is the past. Sounds like he needs more relationship experience. And needs to grow up.
-10	ISxJs have extremely low risk tolerance (at least when it comes to matters in their focus; they can be surprisingly careless about other things they don't think much of).\n\nAt any rate, I should mention that ISFJ/INFJ is a *horrible* romantic pairing (why would they even be attracted??) - each has the other's dominant function as their "demon" (8th), leading to profound, infuriating friction when together too much.\n\nBut of course, it's unlikely that you've typed yourselves correctly anyhow; so the point is moot.
0	Is there a way to tell if this isfj girl likes me (intp) as a friend or as a potential partner?	^Backstory: *From what I know, she's been in a bad (unfulfilled) relationship for years and I've known her since, but we never made an effort for any close contact. Recently I chatted her up and we may meet in a couple of weeks for lunch.*\n\nI am very oblivious when it comes to stuff like this and know everyone is different and mbti just goes so far, but are there any quirks isfj's do that could help me differ in what direction this may be going?
3	Just ask her what she wants. \n\nI'm an ENTJ who is married to an ISFJ. This advice worked for me. 
2	As an ISFJ I'd probably try to initiate a conversation about her deep emotions and try and let her open up. However don't be too forceful as it is very hard to try and talk about yourself, for an ISFJ.\n
0	Even if an ISFJ is in a shitty relationship, and she were to meet her perfect man... she would *still* cling to her past. Never underestimate the inertia of an ISFJ relationship. Assume she is, for all intents and purposes, married.\n\nAt any rate, IxFJ's can get along very well with IxTP's. As an INTP myself, I'm very fond of them.
8	ISFJ Triats In Real Life	Hey, I know I don't belong here but, as an ISTJ who has at least three ISFJs in my life, I'm curious if the similarities I see between them are unique to this type. Do you relate to these characteristics, my observations? \n1) Being a dedicated participant in a sport (examples: dancing, surfing, volley ball) that you're very passionate about\n2) Prioritizing travel, specifically to work or volunteer in impoverished countries\n3) Appreciating music but not sharing and listening to it as much as your friends\n4) Likes having piercings, contemplates getting a tattoo\n5) Comforts others by sharing personal experiences that involved a similar emotion/situation\n6) Hesitant to initiate friendship but will quickly commit to it with loyalty\n7) Great at portraying your feelings through ascetics  \n8) Naturally attracts children \nEDIT: For 2) I know ISFJs who play instruments, and do love music! What I've noticed is that *compared to to other types*, they seem to prioritize other things more. But I know you got rhythm, okay? :)
4	Well, I'm an ISFJ, so I'll try my best to answer this based on my experiences.\n\n1) Not for me, no. I've tried basically every sport out there. I hated all of them. I prefer just running by myself, when it comes to exercise. \n\n2) Nah. To be honest, I actually don't really like traveling. It makes me kind of anxious, and I know I would feel really uncomfortable traveling to a third-world country, especially by myself. I do care a lot about helping the world and those less fortunate, but I would prefer to do it in a way that feels safer, for me.\n\n\n3) I listen to music probably at least 3+ hours a day. I'm very, very passionate about it. Whether I'm driving, cleaning, reading, running, even just sitting around doing nothing, I have music playing. I also do share it with friends fairly frequently. So I'd say this one doesn't apply to me either. \n\n\n4) Yes, I'd say I agree with this one. I'm kind of picky about piercings, but I do want a whole bunch in my ears, and I definitely want a tattoo at some point. The only thing stopping me is the fear of regretting it someday.\n\n\n5) Yeah, definitely. I'm not very good at comforting people. The only way I know how is to share a similar experience I went through, and how I coped with it, to try and show that I know how they're feeling.\n\n\n6) Kind of. I'm really shy, and frankly, I don't really know how to make friends very well. But when other people initiate a friendship with me, more often than not, I deeply value their friendship over time, and I'm very loyal to them. It takes me a while to feel close to people and trust them, though.\n\n\n7) I don't really understand exactly what you mean with this one. If you clarify a little bit, I'll try my best to answer it.\n\n\n8) Meh, kind of.\nI do like children, and they seem to like me, but I'm often pretty awkward and uncomfortable around them at first. Once I spend a little time with them, I tend to warm up a lot, and kids really like me. But when I first meet them, I don't really know how to talk to them or act around them, so I end up feeling kind of stiff and awkward.

1	3,4,5,6,7,&8 are all extremely me.  
1	1) I'm quite serious about working out.\n\n2) I definitely prioritise travel, but always the kind that allows me my creature comforts. I also prefer to help people in a more behind-the-scenes way (e.g. donations, doing grunt work, etc.) because I get overwhelmed easily by other people's emotions and also don't want to fuck up frontline stuff and make a bad situation worse than it already is. \n \n3) I listen to music a lot, but I don't tend to feel as connected to the artists as a lot of the people I know. \n \n4) No, that's not really my thing. \n\n5) Yes! \n\n6) Yes, if I click with someone.\n \n7) I know what I like aesthetically, but I wouldn't say I'm great at portraying my feelings aesthetically.\n\n8) I'm pretty much the same way with kids as I am with adults - not great at initiating, not great at making conversation when we don't have anything in common, but once we click we're BFFs.
1	I like working out, I hate team sports or any type of group sport\n\nI hate traveling, and prefer a staycation to a vacation any day\n\nMusic is good\n\nI can't say I like/dislike piercings, but maybe I'll get a tattoo if I do something that warrants one\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nKinda\n\nNaturally attracting children makes me feel kinda creepy... but I find I get smiled at a lot by little kids (also kinda creepy). I don't really like kids though, and I don't think I'll have any. At least not biological kids

1	I'm having trouble thinking of what to get my ISFJ girlfriend for Christmas	She buys most of what she wants. She's into girly things. I was considering buying some kind of experience rather than a physical gift. She takes Christmas pretty seriously. Suggestions?
5	ISFJ's often like homemade, DIY stuff, gifts that come from the heart or at least have some thought behind them. But honestly you just need to get her a gift that shows you know her and know what she likes in some way. If she reads pick out a book that sounds good for her. If you know her favourite candies/chocolate buy some of those for stocking stuffers that I assume she'll have if she takes Christmas seriously. You could get her a gift card or something for a pedicure/manicure (maybe a massage if you think she'd like that) if you wanted to go with the experience gift. If you put effort in and try I'm sure she'll recognize it and be happy. Get a nice card and write something sweet and meaningful in it and you should be set.
2	ISFJs appreciate when you put thought and effort into a gift - if it's something you can create yourself, all the better. My mother's an ISFJ and the best present I ever gave her was a collection of CDs I made with 1960s pop songs she used to listen to as a kid. Money's not an issue so much with ISFJs - they like when you pay genuine attention and choose with care.\n\nThat said, is your GF into makeup? If you're crafty she'd might love a custom-built battle station/vanity.  
6	Opinions on ENFPs?	I am an ENFP, and I am wondering what you ISFJs think of us, since many of my friends are ISFJ. Thanks :).
5	ENFP is probably my favorite personality type. I love your open-ness, your depth, your empathetic natures, and your willingness to talk about literally anything. I appreciate your love of meaningful connection and of getting people to open up. I have a hard time talking about myself, so it's nice to have someone who shows a lot of interest and encouragement. \n\nHowever, I often feel like you lose interest in friendships, which can be hard. It seems like you have the ability to become close with pretty much anyone, so friendships are "a dime a dozen", and becoming close with someone isn't always very noteworthy or special. I know that's not actually the case, but from my perspective, I usually only have like one close friend, and they are SUPER important to me. If you have earned my trust, you have my consistent support, my loyalty, my respect and my affection until the end of time. So it can be hard to come to terms with the fact that my ENFP friend can easily find closeness with someone else. I feel like I could be replaced with someone that the ENFP finds more interesting. In other words, ENFPs are not very consistent or committed, which can be very hard for an ISFJ, because we are very strongly both, so when the ENFP doesn't show those qualities, we feel slightly betrayed. 
5	My SO is an ENFP, and so is one of my coworkers and close friend. \n\nWhat I like about you ENFP's is your way of thinking and how deep your thought processes are. You guys can get really deep into a topic yet talk about literally everything. This is great because sometimes I don't want to, or feel like, opening up or talking about a topic.  \n\nBut another plus is that even if I don't feel like a topic is worth me mentioning, but I mention it anyways, you guys would pick it right up and can make that topic of discussion into something that *is* worth talking about. \n\nYou guys are uplifting to us ISFJ"s when we have our sad moments and you are, in my experience, quite loyal to your friends.  \n\nOne downside I have noticed is that sometimes you can get a little side tracked with things and need a few reminders here and there to get you going. Or you guys get distracted really easily. But it's honestly what makes you guys so awesome, unique and interesting. \n\nI hope you love us ISFJ"S just as much as I love ENFP's :)
2	My first boyfriend and serious relationship was with an ENFP whom I met online in 2009. We were friends for years before dating and I always felt a very strong connection and admiration for him. Perhaps it's because he was often able to speak up and do things that I was far too shy and soft spoken to do. When we dated our communication could be rough on my side, I don't like to speak up and confrontation is hard but he'd bring it up sometime or eventually get what was bothering us out in the open. Something that I took for granted because others have been content to let things go and allow bad feelings to fester. \n\nI found that he would often get caught up in a crazy plan or really into a game or something of that nature and he'd devote himself to it 100%. I'd kind of be forgotten in the midst of it all. THere were often times in our friendship where he was not at all present because he lost interest and was drawn into other things. ENFP's seem to get caught up in fantasy and unrealistic things that I don't think about much so I grounded him in that sense. Whereas he was there to ground me when my anxiety flew out of hand. He was the most passionate, caring and hard-working person I've ever met. A truly unique and special person I'll never forget.
1	I have an ENFP friend and hes really fun and really cool\n\nPretty much never a dull moment with him
1	Enfp's are great. I don't know about all isfj's but I don't usually come up with new ideas all that much. I tend to just stick to what I know, but my friend since I was 3 is an enfp and he's always got great ideas, just doesn't notice all the little logistical details that go into things and that's where I come in. Makes a good team
1	Used to date an ENFP and it was a fun experience. I love how you guys are totally unpredictable and could make things interesting especially in a relationship. One more thing I liked is that you seem to wear your hearts under your sleeves, making it easier for us to open up to you and form deeper emotional connections.
4	What is your most commonly felt emotion?	
14	Feelings of self-doubt (well doubt in general), anxiety, over worrying. \n\nBut sometimes, there is a tiny hint of confidence and happiness *somewhere*
7	Anxiety, disappointment, and sadness.
5	I'd say happiness. I am, and always have been, a very very happy person.\n\nSecond to that would be anxiety. :P
5	Worry, anxiety, uncertainty. Excited sometimes heh.
4	1st: anxiety\n\n2nd: curiosity
4	Anxiety! Contentedness. Sometimes happy and confident. Sometimes depressed
3	I'm mostly always happy, but i also have feelings of loneliness 
2	Guilt! For some reason I always wish I had spent time differently, spoken more nicely, etc. 
3	I'm an ISFJ with an INFJ partner. This helped me understand what goes on inside his head! Hope you find this helpful too.	
5	I'm worried that I am headed for the wrong career.	I am supposed to start University in January, although I may postpone due to other, more pressing issues. My majors are Psychology and Sociology. I've been in love with both subjects for as long as I can remember. I've always got my face buried in a book on either subject. I cannot get enough of them. \n\nAfter my Bachelors degree is my major concern. I want to go to law school, but I am beginning to wonder is it really the best place for me to be. I'm thinking that getting my Masters and becoming a Psychologist rather than a Lawyer would be more suitable.\n\nThoughts?
3	I wanted to be a nurse after getting my bachelors in psychology from Purdue but after a single anatomy course at another college, I realized how much I don't care about nursing and how much I do care about psychology. I've since switched tracks and I'm meeting with an advisor for U of Indy to pursue a clinical psychology masters degree.\n\nIt's really hard to learn things when you don't have the passion to apply what has been learned (or the passion to learn it in the first place). Follow your instinctual calling. There's no abundance of psychologists, so you're likely going to get a job very soon after completing a masters program in clinical psychology.\n\nOr try the law career. But there's a *reason* you feel this way.
2	From what I've read, a lot of traditional recommendations for ISFJ would point you toward being a psychologist.\n\nBut you have time to figure things out! You're only just starting for your Bachelor's degree. University gives you a great opportunity to explore if you take diverse classes. I'd say if possible take some sort of law classes and see if you click with the subject at all.\n\nWho knows maybe you will get a job out of college and won't need to go to law/graduate school.\n\nThe only issue I've experienced really is money -- I went for an Animation degree and often have trouble finding projects. Sometimes I wish I didn't do what I loved and instead did something more practical like Computer Science. But I am lucky to have enough savings and some support from my family to get by.
1	Could be worse; I know several ISxJ philosophy majors.\n\nThey're not so hot in abstract discussions, but they are *masters* at knowing the names of things.
6	Dealing with death	Hi I was wondering how some people here deal with death.\n\nFor me my aunt passed away a couple days after Thanksgiving. After a long battle with cancer she died in her sleep. I was there to help my mother to close her eyes for the last time.\n\nSince this is the first major death in my life, I'm not quite sure what if I'm going through is grief or not. The funeral is this weekend but I'm continuing life and going to work. The only difference is I have been feeling numb and more alone than usual. A couple of my friends have reached out to me but I don't want them to worry about me. Lately I've been more concerned if I should act normal or not so that nobody is concerned. I've been feeling like I want to talk to someone but I don't' want to bother anyone...\n\nEvery time I close my eyes I see her image in my head. I'm not quite sure what to do or if I need to do anything since I'm probably in a grieving period. What are others experiences? 
6	I have dealt with death before and what you describe is very similar to my own experiences. I rarely talked about them in fear that bringing them up would make others feel awkward. I just ignored it. It never came up in conversations. I felt so alone with it because I did not want to burden others. \n\nThe numbness will come and go. At some points you will might feel extremely intense emotions but these fade as well.\n\nNone of your reactions to this event are wrong. Any way you feel is okay, there is not a "right" way to grieve. You do not have to talk, but I found that in times of desperate need every year or so I would call my closest family member (my own aunt) and just cry. Even while you do not want to burden friends, it is sometimes almost easy to forget every one of your family members is potentially dealing with their own private struggle as well (if they are trying not to burden others). 
5	My brother passed away just over two years ago. I felt exactly like you, numb, alone, and unmotivated. He passed away the Friday before the first week of my senior year in college. I just bottled all of my emotions up, didn't talk to anyone about it, and went about my business. The weeks after that were the worst of my life, I just felt awful.\n\nIn hindsight, I wish I would have opened up to someone and talked with them about how I really felt. I didn't want to bother anyone with my grief, just as you, but looking back I don't think anyone would have seen it as a bother. I'm sure you have people in your life who are more than willing to listen to you, and console you, but you need to let them do that. I strongly suggest not doing what I did. Don't bottle up your emotions, find someone to talk to. If you don't feel comfortable talking to someone in your life, please feel free to PM me. I'm more than happy to talk to you about it.
1	My dad passed away earlier this year. At first it was hard, I would cry at least once a week because I missed him. I was very upset at first and I think I cried a few hours the day he passed. After the funeral I was still upset, but it didn't get worse like I thought it would. I think it was because school was still going on and I wanted to finish the semester on a good note like my dad would have wanted. When he first passed, I had no problem talking about him with family but I felt like I was making people feel awkward when I would make a comment about him. I felt like they were uncomfortable and afraid I would start crying, but I would do it anyways. \n\nIt has gotten easier, I cry every once in a while because I miss him or because I am reminded of something I would never get to do with him. I also now I talk about him without feeling awkward. \n\nI strongly suggest finding someone to talk to about how you are feeling. I had some close friends that I told them everything that was going on and how I was doing. Even now they ask how my mom and I are doing almost every time I see them. 
3	4-Type Chat Room Theory: Better chat rooms based on cognitive function theory. Try before you pass it by (explanation within)	
3	I've joined, already had discord so why not!
15	Y'all are so matter of fact	I think I'm going out with one of you. I'm a entp and you guys just seem so matter of fact. Does that make sense?
3	As a matter of fact...
2	Yes, I think I get what you're saying.
1	Do you mean we are blunt?
1	I like to think I am "to the point".  No bullshit.  REAL.  
5	ISFJs, have you ever been in trouble for being an introvert?	
5	I used to get in trouble in school, too. I could ace every exam but that low/nonexistent participation grade really screwed me over. Just because I don't feel like interacting doesn't mean I am not learning. So frustrating. 
2	Hm. I was always missing the mark in class participation but I really had nothing to say and I was too quiet to want to answer questions. However I heard no complaints otherwise, I was a "pleasure to have in the classroom" ha. The one time where I felt really bad for it was when my nanny (really just a girl a couple years older than me at the time) said that I would be the old lady that died and no one would know for weeks. That hurt to say the least.
8	Cross-Stitching / How do you feel about art?	I decided to make a post about this because, well, for the longest time I've disliked a lot of art. I don't think I'm great at painting or drawing, and these were always pushed upon me by my mom. I never grew up practicing any instruments and still have not learned. And I've always felt kind of bad, because a lot of my family is great with art.\n\nAnyways, I picked up a cross-stitch kit from Michael's and I finally got around to trying it out. And I really am enjoying it! The kit provides everything and instructions -- it's not a free-form art piece but rather there's instructions and as long as you do what the instructions say, it will come out looking good. I have been enjoying it, unlike any other experience I've really had with artwork (and my family really enjoys getting home-made artwork as presents, so I have a lot of stress making their presents normally). Also if I keep practicing with a few other kits, I think I could move on to doing more personal pieces by looking up patterns online and mixing-matching + picking out my own thread colors. So it would be more of my own art rather than just a kit from the store.\n\nAnother thing I'm trying out lately is kind of like scrap-booking? But basically making cards for people with simple images on them (flying pig, moose silhouette, simplistic hummingbird) that I've traced and cut out of scrapbooking paper. It's "art" but I'm not painting/drawing and it's so much less stressful for me.\n\nI'm not sure if anyone else has struggled with the "traditional" arts like I have, but just wanted to share my experience I guess.
3	I once made a tie-die rag in my required arts class in high school. Forgot to let it dry and it ended up soaking the bottom of my backpack.\n\n10/10 would art again.
2	Never could get cross stitching down. Can't draw on my own for shit, I can't be creative that way. However, I did pick up knitting about 6 - 8'years ago. Switched to crocheting about 4 years ago. I'll never be perfect at it, as I have issues with patterns and even remembering how simple stitches work sometimes, but nothing gives me more of a sense of accomplishment than being able to give my coworker a blanket for her upcoming baby. It's a wonderful feeling when you have people constantly asking you to make something for them. It's a thrill Ina no of itself.
1	[deleted]
1	ISFJs are known as being creative but I know I am a sequence learner and need step by step directions. So cross-stitching and crocheting makes sense to be good hobbies although I never got around to trying them. I had a wonderful art teacher in school so I got really into drawing and using pastels. I also took up guitar recently. Thanks to YouTube tutorials and my boyfriend, I am learning a lot but I am so shy and I have little time to practice so I know I'll never be too great at it. You have made me interested in cross-stitching though! I gotta try it out.
7	Strong Fe users! Advice please?	I am an ENTP (tertiary Fe), and I find it pretty difficult to handle emotionally manipulative people.\n\nI tend to kind of just walk away, as I’m not sure what I could say to remedy the situation (YOU REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FE).\n\nAny of you strong Fe users have any ideas for gracefully dealing with these types of situations? Thanks :)
3	I deal with it by either playing into with them with the full knowledge that I'm being manipulated and turn it around on them given the chance to make them realize what they're doing. \n\nOr I give em' the old call out and call their bullshit out on the spot. 
1	Most of the time, I encounter the manipulative types during casual conversation.  They tend to get socially agressive whenever an opportunity (to impress someone they admire or cast a better light on themselves) arises.\n\nTo me, this is a competition, of sorts.  It's not that I necessarily want the thing more, I just want to show them that they don't need it right then and there, and that aggressive social behavior affects everyone involved.
9	How does your inferior Ne come out?	Just curious to see if it's similar for everyone, or if it comes out in different ways.
5	In a negative way, if Im really stressing out I start thinking of all the bad things that could happen or all of the things I could have done to not screw up\n\nIn a positive way, once I find a hobby or something I really like Ill occasionally think of all the different types of things of that hobby I try with that hobby (sometimes I eventually do sometimes I dont) 
1	I find that my imagination is possibly Ne, but not in the best way. \n\nThere are some dark thoughts in there...
1	ISxJ's will sometimes speak, with great confidence and satisfaction, of "getting" something. They really love it when they feel like they grasp the bigger picture, or caught something subtle. It might be cute or something if they weren't constantly wrong - usually due to the nuances of reality being lost in translation to their clean, binary mode of thought.
3	Schedules	Hi all! I am really bad at keeping to schedules I make. I'll always justify slacking off or doing something else by "it's only 5 minutes" which I then repeat to myself every 5 minutes. I end up procrastinating on my work until it is close to being done, and then I feel rushed, which I don't like even though I tend to produce pretty good work (I am currently in school).\n\nHOWEVER when someone else asks me to do something or to complete a request by a certain time I stick to a very strict schedule or get it done ahead of time. I don't know why it is so different when it is asked by someone else. Do you guys have a clue? How are you all with your scheduling abilities?
2	same. i'm suuuuper strict when it comes to scheduling, but only when it involves other people: work, gym trainer, friends, etc.  i do that for people but i hate scheduling. in my free time i don't even look a the time. i just do whatever, whenever....we're meant to be together. i'll be there and you'll be near and that's the deal my dear. 
2	Talking to an ISFJ on a dating site	ENTP here. She seems interested but gives only short answers and it's hard to get her to talk about herself. Any tips? Does she want me to share more about myself so she feels more comfortable in sharing about herself?
8	I am absolutely horrible at talking about myself, and even when I do, I manage to find a way of making it turn into a question to ask the other person. \n\nOne way that helps me open up is when someone asks me a very personal, or thoughtful question. Something that can lead to a meaningful discussion, beyond the whole "What do you do for work?" or "What's your favourite food?" If you feel brave enough and think she may be responsive to it, try asking some questions on this list: https://blog.udemy.com/thought-provoking-questions/ Good luck!! :)

5	[Advice needed] Managing own expectations and how to not be a pushover? Recent example in dating INTJ male.	Hey r/isfj! 29/F here. I've recently got typed as ISFJ and have been reading a whole lot about the whole MBTI thing and how I interact in my relationships with others. I used to keep a blog and when I read back on my posts everything I've written about rings true to being an ISFJ.\n\n**tl;dr: 29/F/ISFJ. 2 dates with INTJ male - far too invested. Close friend (rightly) criticized getting invested too quickly and bending over backwards to accommodate people and pushing friends aside. How to handle emotions and expectations without become full-on cold hearted bitch?**\n\n\n\nA little background into myself - I've always been overweight and had very poor self-esteem and self-worth. About a year ago I embarked on a journey to lose weight and I'm about halfway there! The confidence boost has been amazing, but I still feel very weirded out when people call me pretty/hot/attractive. Don't get me wrong, it's nice, but sometimes I just want to hide in my cave again. Anyway, a byproduct of this is I've been trying out online dating again. My last relationship with an INTJ male really messed me up - but I'm optimistic and will keep trying. \n\n\nMy problem though, is I find myself getting attached to people too easily. My heart speeds far ahead of my mind and after just the first few dates I'm already thinking there's something more, and will accommodate my schedule to prioritize new relationships over older established friendships. An example: met an INTJ guy twice, and after that I texted him saying I'm having fun getting to know him and would be keen to do that in person more - I tried very hard not to use any language relating to relationships/dating but I think he too started overthinking it and read (quite successfully) the subtext of my message. He said that it's definitely feeling more platonic now, more than anything else, but regardless he does still want to meet up. At this point I just said that I know quite early on what I *don't* want, and I haven't made that decision about this yet - *but* if he knows that it's only ever going to be platonic to PLEASE, please let me know. We scheduled to meet up this weekend and I haven't texted him since. I appreciate honest communication - I hate playing games and I am terrible at reading cues, so I tend to lay my cards (and my heart) on the table pretty early on (although maybe yeah 2 dates is a little premature).\n\n\nI showed the conversation to a close friend and she ripped into me over this, basically saying that I should stop being a doormat and that guys should have to earn my time rather than handing it up so easily. I agree with a lot of what she was saying, but to say I wasn't hurt by it would be an understatement. I told her that I recognize and agree with her points but didn't want to discuss it because my current first instinct was to get defensive and try and explain everything away. I was also thoroughly mortified by my recent interactions with the guy (mentioned above) and now I'm not really looking forward to seeing him, or dating anyone to be honest. I feel like I haven't got a grip on how to approach potential relationships healthily and maybe I shouldn't be let loose on the dating scene. Basically feeling like a failure all round.\n\n\nSorry for the wall of text, but what I'm asking, in essence, is how to chill the fuck out and not let my emotions go into overdrive. How do I find that balance in shielding my heart while staying true to myself? I am definitely capable of going full cold hearted emotionless person (not that I'd be particularly happy) but it seems to be either extreme for me - how do I find that middle ground?
3	best way is to do you and be unafraid of going after what you want and being yourself. screw subtext. "i like your face, let's date". don't wear half your heart on your sleeve, worrying that you have to pull it back if things don't go as your expect. full heart that shit. be like "2 dates have been awesome! and i really like you in a romantic sense" and if he's like "i feel platonically about you" you can be like "well that's how i feel, so that sucks. this ain't gonna work out i guess". it's just a bump on your road toward going after what you want. and what you want isn't a specific person, it's being with someone a certain way. figure out what that type of person and type of relationship is and shoot for it. fearlessly yourself.
6	What are the best ways for people to show you they love, care, or lust for you?	INTJ here who has recently started dating an ISFJ. I'm absolutely fascinated by her for a huge many reasons. One of those reasons is that I feel like she has a great deal of depth to her life that she doesn't even recognize as being special, unique, or important. I will certainly ask as our relationship continues to grow what types of things are ideal for her, but I also recognize that it may take her some time to open up on a great many things including what she really wants in certain aspects since she may not know. We're both in our early 30's with good jobs and rich lives apart from each other, but I want to show her to the best of my ability currently that I care for her, or lust for her without being misunderstood or offensive while I patiently wait to get a better understanding of her as we spend time together.\n\nWhat are the ways you most like to be shown that someone cares for you, loves you, or lusts for you?
11	[deleted]
6	I'm an ENFP gal and my bf of 3 months is an ISFJ. I tell him I appreciate him all the time for the little things he does, like tuck me in at night and make me coffee in the morning. He says no one's ever told him that they appreciate him before. I notice he does a lot of "thankless" jobs for his family and work.\n\nAlso, I ask him if he wants time to play his games or work on his truck, etc. He spends most weekends with me and doesn't get to do a lot of things around the house while I'm there so I make sure he has time to do those things because he likes them. \n\nHe told me that he likes to make me happy, even if it means he goes without something. I appreciate that but I care about his happiness too. I make sure his needs are met even if it's just washing the dishes after dinner or not talking during a movie even if I really want to. \n\nHe's pretty easy to please. It was his birthday yesterday and I gave him a card with the logos of all the stores and restaurants we've been to since our first date photoshopped into a frame. I wrote him a poem too and he liked it and said no one's ever went to that much trouble or written something for him before. He didn't want a gift and said he'd be uncomfortable receiving one. My other ISFJ friend (a female) loves receiving gifts so I don't know if it's an ISFJ thing or just a personal preference.\n\nWe haven't been dating that long so I don't know the ins and outs of ISFJ relationships yet, but I hope some of that was helpful :)
5	You could always ask her to take this quick quiz and get a pretty general idea of what she prefers :)\nhttp://www.5lovelanguages.com/profile/
3	May it still be useful to answer this thread, I'll add my personal comment.\n\nThe fact that I'm a male ISFJ should not interfere that much, my mother being an ISFJ as well (so I have at least 1 example of both situations).\n\nIt seems that ISFJs very often have "Acts of service" as 1st 'outcoming' (emitting) love language. **But** please be aware that the love language we speak is not always the love language we best like to hear...\n\nIt seems that ISFJs often has "Words of affirmation" as preferred 'incoming' love language !\n\nWhich makes sense: ISFJs find natural to help, but most often don't expect the same in return. Anyway, we are often frustrated not to have *at least* a "thank you" answer, even if we often even don't really pay attention to that (because of the habit we have not to be thanked). And another thing is we are anxious, and need to be reassured constantly about our special SO's feelings and intentions.\n\nSo Words of affirmation comes 1st.\n\n2nd seems to often be "Physical touch" (seems that we're often touchy-feely as soon as we're with in romantic relationship with SO, but this probably depends more on the person than the fact that "Words of affirmation" comes 1st). \n\nThe rest is 'special bonus'.\n\n"Acts of service" could hit the top because this is ISFJ-type outcoming love language, the kind of things quite rare for ISFJ to obtain spontaneously (which then they don't hope from anyone, because of their reasonable expectations from other persons). \n\nBut beware of the risk of not being able to deliver regularly "Acts of service" throughout the time of your relationship: ISFJs being generally passive-aggressive when they face relationship issues, you could pay a high price the degradation in your "Acts of service" ability... without seing it really come, or being able to read/interprete the signs of degradation of your relationship.\nI think this trend is probably worse from ISFJ women.\n\nAnother thing that may be useful for you: traditionalist and/or religious ISFJs (which I'm not), more particularly women, seem to often think that their SO should know about their feelings and/or expectations without the need for them to say/explain anything. This is a classical flaw, but maybe more frequent for such persons (which is often the case for xNTJ persons, moreover). And there is absolutely **NO** obvious at all in life, specially in terms of feelings and expectations.\n\nSo I think it's specially important for you to prevent that by focusing on communication, which is quite critical due to the fact that you're both introverted, AND quite opposite in terms of cognitive functions (ISFJ=Si Fe Ti Ne, INTJ=Ni Te Fi Se) ! So there will be many communication issues, whatever you do !!\n\n3 other things: \n\n_ISFJs take love and commitment very seriously. Don't take love easy or you'll break her heart for years.\n\n_ISFJs value stability, courtesy, sometimes chivalry, traditional-type attentions. What is cheesy for others is often praised by ISFJs.\n\n_If you offer her gifts, you'd be well inspired to choose them with a lot of sense, according to her intimate preferences/meaning. And for an ISFJ, something which can help them to deal with everyday life (her actual & personal everyday life) will have as much meaning as a romantic attention. So these would be the two leading types of appropriate gifts. You should find advice about this on the Internet.\n\nI wish the best for both of you.\n\n\nPierre-Yves
2	When someone goes out of their way for me, it makes my day. Nothing makes me happier. No matter how small the act.
1	I'm also an INTJ, currently courting a charming ISFJ. Thanks for the advice, guys. 
2	Recently, I've been wondering if I'm actually either ISFJ or ISTJ. Based on the following what do you think?	I'll try to be fair on both sides.\n\nOne thing I know for a fact that I'm definitely Si dominant and Ne inferior. I like that sense of security of sticking with something I'm familiar with. While I'm open to new things it takes me a bit longer to try things than I'd like. \n\n* Generally when I speak, I actively aim to speak knowing the social norms. While I'd prefer to be honest, I recognize how you say things can really affect how people react especially if you can become overly honest.\n* I like organize my hobby life quite a lot. Like I have fun organizing which games I want to play or anime to watch and in what order.\n* While I don't mind being by myself, I prefer to have some fairly active social life, I've been building social lives on online communities.\n* Speaking of communities I don't mind being a leader of them (and in fact I'm in charge of a few) but if I had the choice I'd rather work in the background.\n* In fighting games, if I recognize someone isn't as good as me, I'll purposely hold back since I'm afraid they'll quit if they get too overwhelmed from losing too badly.\n* I welcome criticism as long as it's constructive and said in a way that's helpful in a way I can actually get myself to improve. If one is too negative or says it in a way that's too mean then that's when I get my feelings hurt.\n* Sometimes I like making sure things are done by a certain time or day. Other times I procrastinate and just do things whenever just depends on the motivation I have for the task.\n* If people talk to me about problems I like to empathize but I also want to see them get over it so I also try to offer solutions (even if I'm not particularly experienced with the issue but I try).\n* When there's conflict or arguments.. I don't mind them if they are civil but if they get too out of hand then I'll try to stop it or avoid them for a while.\n* If there's a general negative air in a community I visit, I'll likely either take a break from it or never visit it again.\n* Very loyal to the people/things I like a lot. (This seems like something that applies to both though)\n* I believe I have a strong sense of right and wrong. I don't really like to enforce it on people. \n* I'm usually more interested in hearing other opinions on stuff before expressing my own. Reading/hearing people's opinions on stuff is interesting to me even if it's very unique. As long as they aren't obnoxious about talking about it.\n* I HATE gossiping. I don't want to talk about things about people if it's not necessarily confirmed to be true (especially behind their back).\n* If I say something that's wrong and someone tells me it's wrong (even if it's corrected in a nice/polite way) I beat myself up for it.\n\nIf you have any questions, that you think would help clarify feel free to ask them. Thanks!
2	Maybe sorta kinda ISTJ? Maybe you should try posting to /r/MBTI so they can see. 
7	It’s the same with everyone, no one has many friends.	
2	With respect to both OP and the author, isn't the author's opinion a bit of an overgeneralization? 
6	Some people/sites say or at least theorize ISFJs are the most social of the introverts. Do you think this is true?	I guess social in this case meaning most willing to make acquaintances/friends or just most willing to want to talk to people? (Not necessarily most talkative)\n\nIn theory it makes sense since Fe wants to sense and notice the responses from the world/people and Si means being very observant of all the details of our physical surroundings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
13	I think other introvert types might have different strengths in social situations. I love being out in public and observing people. But when I'm in a group and its my turn to talk, I get overwhelming anxiety if I'm around people I'm not comfortable with. My fiance however, who is an INFJ, hates the thought of being around people, but once he is, he can adapt better than I can and hold a conversation with confidence like he does it all the time. INFJs are actually commonly mistaken for extroverts.
6	i kind of have to force myself to spend time with people. i know that if i don't, i'll drift into isolation and detach from my friends.\n\ni like talking to strangers though, but i don't want to connect with them beyond that initial interaction.
3	Many of my friends are introverts as well, and I usually find that I am the one arranging gatherings/plans, despite how much I hate organizing such things...not sure what that says about me. I don't think of myself as super social, but I like select social situations sometimes. Maybe it's just a matter of having control over the social situation. It stresses me out, but I like when things are planned ahead of time.
2	I like to observer people and listen.  
2	In my experience, ISFJs require a lot of socialization, or at least a close friend group. I know two ISFJs who are somewhat isolated and only have a few friends; it makes them really unhappy. Whenever they do get the chance to hangout with people or socialize, they get really excited/happy and then get social anxiety motormouth where they sort of talk nonstop. I never get like that. I can't remember the last time I craved random social interaction.\n\n I feel like my social quota needs are wayyyyyy lower than the ISFJs I know. I could just talk to 2 people my whole life and be totally fine. ISFJs seem to need more than that. 
2	They are the most common type -- 13.8% of the US population. (ISTJ is second at 11.6%.)\n\nPeople tend to socialize because they are comfortable in the environment, and a great contributor to social comfort is "relatability." So, assuming that roughly 1/4 of the US population is IS_J, it is likely these types, while preferring Introversion, live in a world with many people they can relate to. \n\nAdditionally, ISFJs are Extraverted Feelers, and Extraverted Feeling often motivates one to act according to the behaviors of those around them. Almost half of the US Population prefers Extraversion, and so it makes sense that an ISFJ using Extraverted Feeling would often be in situations where they are compelled to be more social than other Introverted types.\n\nSource for MBTI type breakdown: [How Frequent Is My Type?](http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/my-mbti-results/how-frequent-is-my-type.htm)\n
1	I would definitely agree with this. I absolutely want to connect, but I don't want to be the centre of attention or talk the most. I like connecting by being a fly on the wall, at least to start with. I like observing and then making my way into an social interaction with some background information sort-of. I don't feel comfortable going headlong into any sort of interaction or relationship whatsoever. Maybe that is how the introversion plays a role? I know it can even appear or come off as snobby at first when in reality it's just, "I need to take my time and collect some information before making an attempt." Lol. 
1	Hello, \n\nI found a few months ago an interesting picture on the Internet about extroverted introverts, telling that: \n\nIxFJ are extroverted with emotional interactions\n\nIxTJ are extroverted with intellectual interactions\n\nINxP are extroverted with exploring possibilities\n\nISxP are extroverted with *doing*.\n\nI've experienced that (as an ISFJ, and with such other types).\n\nAnd it really makes sense with MBTI in general, understanding the cognitive functions. Do I feel.\n\nDepends on what we're talking about, as says the picture   :-)
3	How do you learn best?	My psych homework got me thinking about this, and I'd be interested to see if there's a possible correlation between our personality type and preferred learning styles. I'd say I'm a mix of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. 
5	I consider myself a multimodal learner, but I prefer kinesthetic learning. When it comes to studying I rewrite all of my notes over and over. There's no organization to it at all. I just rewrite because I find that it sticks better to memory. I go through so many notebooks though.
2	For me, I need my teachers to be engaging with me. Talk to me, ask me questions pertaining to the subject matter, that kind of stuff.
1	I really prefer a mixture of all.  I feel like learning in only one style doesn't provide me with the desired amount of understanding.\n\nFor example, if I am practicing coding I will try to find a video about the subject.  Then, try it on my own while reading some form of reference.
1	Visual stuff helps a lot\n\nJust reading text gets boring and monotonous
1	Auditoral 100%. I can listen to lectures or other audio on 2x speed and understand and retain everything very well.
8	Does anyone else hate loud, obnoxious people and feel compelled to tell them how annoying they are?	So I have a very low tolerance for certain loud people who tell anyone who will listen about their problems or brag about their lives. Especially if those people have nothing worth bragging about. It's like they just want to be heard. Everyone around me is just as annoyed as I am by them, but I feel compelled to shut them down. Especially when they start to use their loudness to bully other quiet people. I can't stand it. And when I tell them to back off, they get extremely offended and talk shit to everyone about me. I had to deal with one girl like this in grade school and I currently work with a guy that does it. Some call me a hero for calling those people out but they never back me up in front of them and I end up looking like the bully. Any other ISFJ's experience this?
2	I could never tell them to be quiet, but I do get very very annoyed. My usual method is just to not look or act impressed with anything they are saying. I call them AWs (Attention-Whores). I have no tolerance for them as a friend.\n\nMy current roommate is an AW and he likes to brag about *everything* he does. I smoke pot daily, but I never mention it. If he smokes pot one time a month, he has to walk in and brag about how high he got, how dank the weed was, blah blah *blah* and it pisses me off. I smoke, I don't brag about it. I drink, I don't brag about it.\n\nIt bothers me so fucking much. But I could never tell him that.
2	Right now. Wish I could tell the people in the next dorm room to shut up so I can concentrate on my reading, but that would be rude so I won't.
1	Before my husband transferred he had a boss that did nothing, but brag and quite loudly. The more he drank the louder he got. Long story short? We are now in a more desirable area with a less egotistical asshat for a crew-leader/boss. This guy was so loud, obnoxious and grating I cannot remember half of what came out of his mouth. Only that it was usually open and saying irrelevant crap about his belongings and accomplishments.\n\nYech.
3	Hey there ISFJ's I'm making a chat for the "Sentinels" type personalities (ISTJ, ISFJ, ESTJ and ESFJ) come join us!	Greetings ISFJs.\n\nI'm creating a Skype chat for people who fit into the role of the "Sentinels" which according the the [16-personalities website](http://www.16personalities.com/articles/our-theory) "Highly practical embracing and creating order and security and stability wherever they go." \n\nIn theory Sentinels tend to enjoy each others company and have common goals. So I thought I'd create a chat to see if this is true. So come join us.  \n\n\nHere is the Skype link to join the group: \nhttps://join.skype.com/vsBD6BebPjtH\n\nOr you can contact me directly if you have questions and i'll add you to it directly.\n\nMy Username: kaspeey
11	Anyone tend to get grouchy/grumpy moments?	Usually I want to be helpful to others and have a bunch of good friends.\n\nHowever, sometimes I get annoyed to the point to where I can say some nasty things.. usually when I'm not in a good mood which tends to me when people happen to be annoying me more than usual (and I tend to usually be fairly forgiving/understanding)
6	I do! But I usually keep it to myself, but complain about it to people I know pretty well. 
6	That was me this weekend :( apparently I was really snappy to everyone, turned out all I needed some alone time to recharge.
1	i'm just grumpy when i'm sleepy and hungry at the same time or if it's really hot and humid. but i don't say nasty things. haven't done that since high school. it was when i was annoyed and shitty and said something that really hurt a classmate and i still remember how awful i felt after.
1	I usually only get grumpy when I'm depriving myself of something important (i.e. sleep, food, caffeine). Everyone has bad moments. For me, the threat of doing harm in my relationships with others is what keeps me from saying the nasty things I will think when grumpy.
1	I am the same way. Introverts need that recharge time or we get grumpy. That also includes having a low tolerance for loud or annoying people in general. I also have high standards for people and can become annoyed and passive aggressive when I'm feeling unheard or disappointed. I feel so bad when I get pushed to the point of lashing out.  
1	This is my Girlfriend. Dear God she can be shocking, says incredibly rude or nasty things then expects me to be okay with it. \n\nOften the catalyst for a bitchsplosion is the tiniest thing (yesterday's example - I took off my shoes and left them in the wrong place - BOOM! Bitchsplosion).\n\nWhilst I understand that it's likely a culmination of factors, as an INTP I can't help but get incredibly frustrating by the irrationality she displays - which certainly never helps my situation.\n\nWhat do you ISFJs *actually* expect in this situation? No cryptic crap, no 'You really don't know?!' How do I manage this behaviour?
1	Yeah, I can have really bad mood swings sometimes.. Or I'll just get upset or something little. Usually there's stress or some kind of issue beneath the surface that's bothering me. I just hate saying awful things then realizing 2 seconds after that I've been hurtful. I tend to keep quiet and away from others if I'm in an irritable mood. Better for me better for the people around me ha.
3	How do I approach a non-sensitive boss?	My boss is a very busy lady, and I recently took an admin job under her.  It wasn't my ideal job, but I needed a job, and she offered.  I really like the work I have been doing, but I'm human (and clutzy) so I make mistakes.\n\nI thought this was normal, but I have learned to dread emails from her, because almost every one of her emails/texts are telling me I did something wrong.\n\nI don't want to sound like a whiny baby, but how do I tell her that I need encouragement, as well?  I understand mistakes should be pointed out, but she **only** focuses on messups, instead of acknowledging things I do well.  \n\nIt's really getting me down, but every situation I can come up with in my head about approaching her makes me sound like a cry baby.\n\nTL;DR: My boss is a negative person and is getting me down, how do I approach her?
3	Well, you definitely have a case of bad boss. So you're in the right to call her a negative person. If she were to really help you out with your mistakes, then she would physically come to you and help you with whatever that's messing up the job, and show you what to do, or even work with you on it for a while until you get it again (that's the way a boss should work, work with the employees..of course they have other tasks at hand though). Not email you, that is the worst. I know it's hard but, there should be some free time you can pull her aside where you can share how you feel about those emails and the general pressure she's giving. A good boss will listen. They are there for you to do the job and get it done, not to pressure their employees to the extent of high anxiety sky rocketing to where you won't even be able to do the work.
2	I think the best thing to do is to ask lots of questions. If she is critical of you - ask how you can do better next time and or how she would like things done and just be as friendly as possible. It's less likely for her to be critical when you're actively trying to learn. \n\nIf the criticism is quite regular - probably the best thing to do is to look for another job. I'm sure it doesn't have much to do with your capabilities and more with her personality or something going on at home. \n\nI've been in a similar situation - give it a good go but really - you're just going to reach breaking point trying to please someone who can't be pleased and end up feeling negative about yourself for not being able to live up to her expectations. Not worth it! 
1	Your boss sucks.  If she's demeaning you, she's most likely insecure and worried about her position and status.  Higher ups see this most likely and will keep her flat careered.  Find the persons you admire and are uplifting to socialize with. Give her more than requested and she'll be horrified you want her job.  When combined with your new social group, she will FREAK and destroy herself.  Always be detached, logic centric.  From an ENTJ friend.  
10	Wanting Honesty and Sensitivity - Contradiction?	I have learned that ISFJs very much value both honesty and sensitivity in their personal relationships. \n\nThe ISFJ genuinely wants to know the whole truth in situations they are involved in, even if they are aware they may have a strong emotional reaction. \n\nThe thing that appears to be a continual issue is that ISFJs themselves tend to be quite sensitive, and can be very open in displaying their emotions, and this tends to make them undesirable conversation partners when it comes to talking about harsh truths.\n\nThose explaining the whole truth to an ISFJ will likely be hesitant, because they expect an emotional response that is uncomfortable to deal with -- especially if they are divulging this information *because* they know the ISFJ wants it. They will feel bad regardless, because it is never enjoyable seeing someone become upset because of words coming out of your mouth.\n\nWhat can ISFJs do to take things less harshly and personally, so that those they are close to don't feel bad about delivering "hard" news? And what can non-ISFJs do to deliver sensitive information in a way that is not as hard to bear for an ISFJ?
5	Tbh, this is very well-put. I want honesty, yet I know I might not like the answer. And what I want others to keep in mind is -- I am never blaming the bearer of bad news, anytime I get upset it's most likely I'm getting upset at myself in my head. Getting upset I messed up and need to be criticized (no matter how nicely it's phrased).\n\nThat being said, phrasing and tone goes a *long way* in helping me not get upset. If it's said in a nice tone rather than a mean tone, and if it's said with nice phrasing versus mean phrasing I won't be as upset because it won't seem like a big issue. But I do hate that I've let you down, so I'm giving myself an inner beating.\n\nI think once I can learn to forgive myself, then I will not look as hurt. It also helps me to do something together afterwards to reconnect so I'm not ending on a "bad note" and just going off to do my own thing and be all sad lol.
3	At least for me I prefer the truth just dont say it in a way that makes it sound like Im a terrible person or in a very negative tone that would put me down
1	i've come to understand that truth is relative and can be worded different ways to convey the same meaning. what matters in being sensitive is in the framing of the message. like i can convey that something upset me with or without yelling. but that's an extreme example. \n\nlet's say a friend came to visit me and spent the entire time on their phone and after the visit felt that we did not have fun together and says that the reason is because i did not plan enough fun events for us to do together.\n\na less extreme example is something like being upset at previous behavior:\n\n"you're doing it again. you always rationalize everything after the fact. now you're blaming me for your own actions" \n\nas opposed to talking about previous behavior and comparing it to now:\n"there are times when you explain away the reasons for your actions instead of dealing with the real reasons why you do certain things. it's happened before and you're doing it now . and it is shitty that you're putting the blame on me." \n\nas opposed to choosing instead to talk about the specific incident only:\n"do you really believe that is true or are you rationalizing the fact that you spent the entire time on your phone texting someone else instead of being here with me? it hurts me that you're able to do it so easily".\n\nas opposed to being upset about the specific incident:\n"you're blaming me for this when you've been on your phone all this time?"\n\nas opposed to any other way to frame things. they're all true. you can be upset, you can be sad, hurt, and you can bring up true facts of the past, you can tell things slow over a process of revealing behavior, or you can say it all at once. what matters i find is the right frame to get the right message through.\n\ncommunication is a process of thought, packaging, transferring, and interpretation. because of that, i think the truth should also consider our understanding of the recipient's ability to interpret the message. and i find that we should understand a hurt or emotionally compromised is less able to correctly interpret a message.
10	I don't like being around people anymore...	When I was younger, I looked forward to hanging out with friends on the weekends, and generally enjoyed being around people. Within the last year or so, however, I try to avoid people as much as I can, and find time spent around them exhausting and somewhat pointless. I'd rather be alone and think about life and deep stuff. I think it's like, when I'm around people I use my Fe to the point where I get annoyed with how happy I'm acting, when I'd really rather be serious in solitude. Any other ISFJ's feel like this?
5	Whenever I'm around people, specifically people I care for, the slightest air of tension, sadness or sour-ness changes the climate of my mind. And it's exhausting, the amount of processing done in my brain is staggering. It's as if I can't accept it until I've had the time to digest it.\n\nOn a less negative note, I also get a little worn when people make plans, and ask if I'm interested in tagging along (ski trip that will cost you 500$ this weekend ?). It's too short notice for me to feel comfortable saying yes, but I don't want to disappoint people with a no. \n\nI prefer laid-back, neutral company. Though I never feel like I don't wanna go home.\n\n
4	Totally what I am feeling.  I am almost 53, and honestly I feel I could be a hermit.  I do teach middle school, so that explains some of my need for alone time.  I wonder/worry it might be depression.  I also find myself not needing as many friends.  My ideal life: a cottage with wifi near the beach....alone.  
6	How do you all cope with stress?	I was talking with someone about personality and this got me wondering if there's a link between preferred coping mechanisms and personality type. So as ISFJs, how do you deal with stress?
13	well I don't deal with it very well, that's for sure. I try to ignore it. I will worry about it and then try to go to sleep earlier just so I don't have to think about it lol. I procrastinate working on the problem because I just want to forget it exists. But I *can't* forget so I worry, worry, worry and stress myself out more and more by my lack of action.\n\nWhen I finally do take care of it, whatever it is, I'm very relaxed for a moment. But then once one thing is taken care of, I start to freak out about the next impending problem. I often stress myself out so much thinking about the next problem I'm never actually enjoying myself.\n\nsooo I will be interested to see some of the replies to this!
8	I tend to do ok with stress up until a point, then I have a minor breakdown, then I'm ok again for a while. I finally had to start telling myself, over and over when I screw something up, that it doesn't matter, it wasn't my fault, or there's nothing I can do about it, depending on the situation.  Otherwise I was killing myself mentally. I actually had a mental breakdown last year due to stress. But I'm getting back to where I was before. 
2	I ignore it until its literally in my face and then i cry. my INTP GF tends to be very upset with me whenever i fail to handle a problem (for good reason). my ignorance tactics include video games and youtube and T.V. and working lots (well over 50 hours a week dedicated).
1	I have been taking my college stress out on the Teriyaki joint next to my school. Now time to stress about money. Stress stress stress.
1	I made rules for myself. Sick? Don't work out. Emotionally drained? Work with less effort. Mentally drained? Reduce personal responsibility of emotionally intense situations. If two of the three things I listed are an issue, absolutely no skipping on sleep under any circumstances. Before the rules, I'd stretch myself too thin and break down.
6	Resilience : dedicated to my late iSfj wife	
15	Emotional Help App	I was just listening to this [podcast](http://youarenotsosmart.com/2015/10/14/yanss-60-how-to-turn-your-fears-and-anxieties-into-positivity-and-productivity-with-cognitive-reframing/) about re-framing (very interesting and i hope some of you might listen to it) and they mention a downloadable app, still in beta testing phase, but one i think might be very beneficial to a lot of people here. I just signed up but in doing so is just put on a waiting list. Might take some time before we can use it.\n\nthe app is called [koko](http://itskoko.com/) and it works like so: someone who is feeling bad can explain their situation and why they feel bad and other people using the app can respond by re-framing that situation in a more positive light. it creates a way for people to help each other by sharing their perspectives. so one person can be good at emotionally handling one situation but bad at another can help and get help from people with different mindset pros and cons.\n\ni imagine it'll help a lot with anxiety and self criticizing behaviors which isfj can be prone to have. and it also gives an outlet for the isfj need to help others.
3	Cool idea. Thanks for sharing

3	i'm an isfj and i need help with another isfj	I have a friend who i haven't seen in a while. she moved far away and we keep in touch via phone or skype every few months or so. and about every two years she'd visit. it's been 4 years now. and during that time we have both changed a lot.\n\nshe's unrecognizable to me as a person anymore. when she talks about people, there is so much venom in her voice. so much judgement. she hates "sluts" she hates "fake gamer girls" she hates weak people. she feels like no one appreciates her and acts as if everyone she knows is a potential threat against her happiness. and as she has grown more judgmental, i notice that she's grown more depressed.\n\nshe doesn't view me as a threat though. but she now looks down on me as weak and vulnerable because i am open about myself and openly care for other people instead of turtle-ing like she does.  \n\ni've tried to explain the ideas of keeping boundaries and to only care for people within those boundaries to avoid getting burned. but she says no, she needs to be more "selfish" and stop "sacrificing". i tried talking about how giving is a gift to oneself, in that when we help others it brings us joy. which is worth the effort.\n\nbut she feels that i am lying to myself, deceiving myself to be hopeful in a world of selfish people, and that i am setting myself up to be hurt and taken advantage of by others. and that my advice and world view is nonsense.\n\nrecently another friend of mine had a miscarriage and i am worried about her because she's suffering through hormonal problems and severe depression and is suicidal. i've been talking with her, trying to help. and my friend that moved away told me that my suicidal friend sounds weak, too weak to go through with it. and if she does, then that's her choice and i shouldn't concern myself over it.\n\ni cried when she said that. because of how sad she must be to say something like that. to live a life where that is her mentality. i never thought she could've become so cold as a person. that to her, this is how she displays friendship to me, this is how she helps. wanting me to harden up emotionally over a suicidal friend. wanting me to cut loved ones out of mind, to look down on them, because they'll only hurt me or use me, even unintentionally like through suicide. to tell me that, instead of simply saying "this situation sucks, let's try to figure out something you can do about it".\n\ni don't know how i can get through to her anymore. i'm thinking about giving another shot. but it's not very ethical or respectful to her. i'm thinking about talking to her about helping me become less vulnerable, and ask for advice to harden my compassion. and maybe, through her being there for me and helping me, she can at least feel happier in life, more fulfilled. but...i don't know if that can work or makes sense or if i can keep that up or for how long.  might be dumb and maybe i shouldn't do it. i don't know. help?
3	I'm *a lot* like you where I think helping people is incredibly beneficial. I'm in the field of psychology, so I've devoted my life to it.\n\nHowever, a common thing people in said field say is, "You can't help somebody who doesn't want help. You can't change somebody who doesn't want to change."\n\nRight now, *she* is being toxic. If she doesn't want to change, nothing you can do will change how she views the world. Something must happen directly to her that will change her mind.\n\nIt's unfortunate, but true. You gave it a try, but until she's willing to work on herself, and accept help or see a more positive view of the world, there's not much you can do about it.\n\nI wouldn't invest too much time in trying to find a solution for a situation that has none. She doesn't have a solution yet. Maybe somewhere down the line, but definitely not now. This is where you should try to focus more on yourself. Don't allow her to bring you down.\n\nYou're doing right by being worried over your friend who had a miscarriage. Focus on her instead. She wants the help and support.\n\n**Edit**: Specifying which friend.
2	At first while reading this I assumed your friend had been taken advantage of many times and eventually go mad, then 'realized' being selfless isn't worth it. I've seen many people change this exact way. But then when you mentioned the part about your friends miscarriage, it's pretty clear that she's just being really edgy. It must be exhausting for her to keep up that act all day. You really need to talk some sense into that kid.
1	I don't know about the rest of all that; but I will note that she sounds far more like an ISFP than ISFJ, for what it's worth.\n\nISFJs are total doormats in relationships - to a large extent due to their being terminally empathetic. When you're cut, they bleed. And it takes a **lot** to make an ISFJ truly *hate* someone.\n\nISFPs, when stressed or immature, tend to lash out at others (ISFJs are usually more self destructive). They also hate seeing their mates being "weak", due to their Te inferior. They also hate feeling like others or their situation are weighing them down - compromising their freedom.\n\n*(Disclaimer: ISFPs, when healthy, can be quite wonderful, of course. They are the artists of the world, after all.)*\n\n[ISFP Profile](http://personalityjunkie.com/isfp-type-profile/)\n\n[Lenore Thomson's ISFP](http://personalitycafe.com/isfp-articles/131286-lenore-thomsons-isfp.html#post3317477)
3	Struggling with assertiveness in the workplace	Hey everybody, I'm looking to get some advice. I have had trouble asserting myself all my life and as of recent, I started a new job where I'm being left behind by dominant personality types. We all had very brief training on a couple different positions of the job and I've fallen into working only a 2/3 of the positions. My other extroverted coworkers have all worked the different positions and are very confident in their abilities.\n\nI recently gathered the courage to ask to work more hours, but there has been no change. I actually started being scheduled even less than before at two days a week, while my coworkers are on average working 2+ more days (part time job). I'm having a really hard time and I don't think my boss likes me very much. My boss is always talking with my loud and boisterous coworkers and typically shuts me down when I try to make conversation. I have a feeling it's because I'm asking too many questions at work, since I want to make sure to do everything correctly and it could be seen as lacking confidence. \n\nI personally have a hard time when the work I put in just isn't good enough and I'm really trying to get over it and tell myself that I could just be more dominant, confident and aggressive like my coworkers, but I can't. I tend to be very self critical and I do take things really hard, so I'd appreciate anyone telling me if I'm over thinking things. Does anyone else struggle with this? I would greatly appreciate anything that anyone has to say. Thank you.

35	17 ISFJs Explain The One Thing They Wish Others Understood About Their Personality	
2	Wow, that was a great read. I identified with so many of those comments, especially about thinking and feeling a lot. Unfortunately, I can be very self-critical and worry a lot about my life. 
9	ISFJs who love their jobs, what do you do?	Stolen from INFJ
6	I've had two jobs.\n\n1) In highschool, worked at a use bookstore. I stamped books with our stamp, I stacked them, ordered them, put them on the shelves, alphabetized the shelves, helped customers... This honestly would be my dream job, if I had a choice and I could've made a living doing this. This job was just so unstressful, I could not mess up. I really just like knowing that I am doing everything right and I don't have much chance of messing up. I also liked that I didn't have to manage anyone -- I was the one being managed.\n\n2) Teacher (kind of). I work at a conservancy/park and we do once-a-week classes for homeschooled children and I lead this class. I also lead educational stations during field trips to our park. I enjoy this work, but it is also much more stressful to me. The fieldtrip stations are not bad, once I have done the station I am comfortable doing it again (as we have set programs we do, and repeat stations often). The homeschool class is a bit worse only because each class is something completely new, and I used to have *nightmares* the night before I would teach the class... Thankfully I have finally gotten somewhat used to it. This job has probably helped me a lot with some of my anxiety regarding speaking in front of people... much less intimidating to speak to a group of kids!\n\nIf I could choose, I would happily be a book-stamper and shelver forever. But I do realize that the job where I am working with other people and kids has really helped me a lot so I am happy I am doing it :) It's also super cute to get cards from kids telling me how great I am lol.
5	Social worker \n\nWw are naturally caring and selfless beings :) 
5	I'm a social worker. :) Seems to be a common theme here!
5	Not a ISFJ myself, but from the ISFJs I know:\n\nfemale ISFJ friend #1: social worker\nfemale ISFJ friend #2: teacher\n\nmale ISFJ friend: started his own company with his friends and is selling medical care stuff, vegan food and several other things (they divided it into several shops); besides that, his family has a farm and he loves to help there in his free time every here and then
5	Research assistant. Best job I ever had.
4	I am Quality Assurance Engineer. \n\nI've always like Computer Science development but the actual programming side is too stressful for me.\n\nBeing able to be part of the team, making sure the app works as it should, building a good relationship with the team client, and just seeing the customer being a satisfied with the app is very satisfying. \n\nGenerally QA doesn't get as much attention from other members of the development team or client but the few people who openly appreciate what I do make me happy.
3	[deleted]
3	I work at an animal shelter. Mainly doing assistant work for the Executive Director and higher ups. But, I do get to go to a lot of events with the dogs and walk them and advocate for them. Absolutely love my job, wouldn't change it for the world. :)
3	How about data analyst? Anybody out there? I'm an ISFJ and after thinking I could be a teacher (don't think it was really my thing) , I'm now considering to get into the IT field. 
1	I do library stuff at a university, but am not a full fledged official one as I don't have the master's degree for it. 
5	ISFJ girl with ENFP guy	I am an ISFJ girl dating an ENFP guy. I rarely see posts about the ISFJ and ENFP combo so I would love to learn more! \n\nI want to know your experiences dating an ENFP and how it turned out.\n\nI know communication isn't our biggest strength but I am actively trying to improve on that. \n\nI am trying to figure out what makes them happy, sad, their love language, etc. \n\nThanks for sharing! 
2	Hello you lovely ISFJ, \n\nI am an ENFP girl, and currently in a relationship with an ISTP. \n\nI had an affair with an ISFJ - thus the throwaway account - Meeting an ISFJ was something new for me, probably why I got into that affair in the first place. I absolutely adore the way they will put you in the center when they love you. I remember feeling particularly special when an ISFJ loves me. I get showered with attention and affection.\n\n... And you know what ENFPs like - it's attention. \n\n**What makes them happy** : being with people that they're comfortable with, new and exciting things, affection (which ISFJs have plenty of when you love someone), receiving things (doesn't necessarily have to be huge or expensive - the more thought you put into it, the more sentimental it becomes to us)\n\n**What makes them sad** : conflicts, criticisms, isolation, we feel it when you get frustrated at us, being ignored and being left out\n\n**Love language** : very affectionate, likes giving things, likes being around you when we like you, gets jealous when you start showing attention to someone else, likes doing things for you, would please you first sexually (like, I get turned on knowing my partner is turned on)\n\nI don't particularly remember that the ISFJ I met had problems with communication. He easily opened up to me and back then he had depression problems. When he found some other girl and when it was time to end the affair, he didn't have difficulty either expressing what he wanted.  \n\nDo not worry about expressing emotions, ENFPs are good at understanding them. I think being both F's makes it easy for you to love each other. \n
1	Enfp woman with isfj guy. We've been married for 19 years. I wouldn't have it any other way. I feel like he's the yin to my yang. He keeps me grounded when I'm flying every where. He understands that I need light and will drag me out of the dark, sometimes against my will. He's easy going when i should be. \n\nThe only thing I'd change about us is that we never seem to finish a project. Have a boojillion started. About 3 completed. In 19 years. :-)
1	ESFP Pursuing an ISFJ Romance	So I've known this ISFJ girl for a few years now. We lived close to each other for most of college and now that we are out of college our communication has slowed down and at one point, we did not speak for close to 6 months. The first date I took her on was to an art exhibit that served wine and craft beer. Anyway, I have began to rekindle the fire within the past 4-5 months. Every 2-4 weeks or so she becomes very responsive to my text messages and will sometimes throw in a smiley face on the occasion. We have started to interact with each other a lot more often because she is moving much closer to her workplace which happens to be within 15 mins of where I live. Before she found the 1 bedroom we spent two days in a row searching as I drove her around the area near her work. She had initially asked me prior to those two days to help her search, and I gladly picked her up from work to help with it. After that she became rogue for 3 weeks and was very non-responsive to texts. \n\nBasically, sometimes she will respond to texts within 30 mins or so, or sometimes it will take three days which I find kinda irritating. Sometimes she seems very into me and sometimes I feel like she doesn't even care. We get together for a beer or coffee on occasion and she is very engaged with the convo, and will text me sometime after that to tell me about how wonderful it was to be with me. \n\nWhy is it that she is so hot/cold? Should I drop this whole thing entirely because she is playing coy and might have other options? Are ISFJ's typically hot/cold? We are definitely comfortable talking in person with each other, but she tends to jump off the radar randomly in the middle of text convos. I am in such a confused place with her but I really really have strong feelings for her
6	ISFJ here. Can't speak for this girl, but I definitely **unintentionally** do the whole hot/cold thing. Like I'm aware that it happens, but I just tend to procrastinate on texting people back sometimes. I think partially it has to do with the common ISFJ trait of avoiding confrontation - like I see the text when I'm in the middle of something and then forget to text back for a couple hours. Then at that point, I tend to keep putting it off because it's already been so long, so I end up not replying for like 2-3 days.\n\nAgain, I can't speak for this girl, but my advice would to not be discouraged by it. If you're sure about your feelings, keep pursuing her. As Humble as we ISFJ's are, we love to feel appreciated; and often times we have bad communication. There's a chance that this girl is interested in you, and is just shy about the situation because she's unsure if you feel the same way. I mean, I don't know your situation, but if I were you I would bring your feelings out into the open and make it clear that you're interested in her. ISFJ's highly value genuine people that are willing to make a commitment
2	Hmm. As for texting, I can be glued to my phone for hours and respond in seconds and then get distracted and not text anyone for days. Also, I will use smileys and stuff but when I don't it doesn't mean anything different. My bf used to get upset when he send smileys in a text and i just said words back lol. I dont like to make my intentions too clear when I like someone either. Like with my current bf, we were friends for months, but I didn't really know what to do? I don't know if any of this helps but just don't be too alarmed from texts because at least for me communication in person is important but texting not so much. I pay attention to people im with at the time. And idk maybe get her a small gift cuz that always makes me feel warm and loved! like bring her a coffee or one flower or something.
1	Are we talking to the same girl!? I'm just kidding! Unfortunately I'm I find myself in the same shoes as you cloop417 so I wouldn't be much of help. My ISFJ whom I deeply feel for does the same exactly thing! Text throughout the day then suddenly vanishes for days or week, sometimes more =( until I initiate another text. Like you I've confessed my interest for her which in return she responded days later that she's just not looking for anything right now but insinuated that she would like to keep talking (texting) if I'm comfortable with it. A few days of texting then poof, she's gone again. It's very frustrating! Hopefully, one of the ISFJ's here can shed some light on this. 
10	Depression or ISFJ? (repost from r/depression)	I have noticed an ongoing trend over time, and I'm not sure if it comes with my depression, or my personality type.\n\nMy loved ones are my absolute #1 priority. Their happiness is key to my happiness, and because of that, I end up dropping everything to help them, whenever possible. What the issue is that often, I find that I am NOT their first priority, if a top priority at all.\nI tend to have near-constant breakdowns about this issue. I rarely come to others with my problems, but when I do, it means I am in DIRE need, and in that case, I tend to get "helped" as much is easy for them, before they revert to their #1 priority (whether it is their S/O, work, school, etc)\n\nIs it my fault that I take these things so seriously, and that I give myself away so freely? Or am I surrounded by ass holes?\nIs it my personality type? Or is it my depression that makes this so painful?
7	ISFJ here with depression as well. I sacrifice a lot for the people I care about, and not getting the same in return can sometimes be extremely hurtful and cause breakdowns. But for whatever reason I keep forgiving them and reverting back to being their helper! \n\nIt's part of our personality to be overly generous like this and it makes it hard to understand why others aren't the same way.\n\nLike you I also try not to come to others with my problems. I remember finally asking for help with my depression when I was 14, and having it be trivialized. This was a personal experience that contributed to my refusal to ask for help throughout my life.
3	It's pretty much your personality type :)  You help others and it might involve you sacrificing your happiness to do it.  It can be hard to say no, especially as an ISFJ.  Don't be afraid, instead of saying no, proposing another time to help them.  Ignore that feeling like you are letting them down if you do this or say no.
2	I had to learn to make peace with the fact that people are very different from me. With the fact that I can't expect people to do as I do. I can't expect people to put as much effort toward others (or me) as I put into them. Just as they can't expect me to be as extroverted or as naturally intuitive as they are. Or they can't expect me to be better able to take care of my immediate needs as opposed to focusing on the needs of others (as we isfj's are prone to do).\n\nAnd I had to make peace with the fact that I like being there for others and i like helping people. And that the enjoyment i get from helping others is worth it. and it's ok to enjoy it without the expectation of getting anything more in return, without any strings.
2	Its just who we ISFJ's are... It sucks I know but I had to learn the hard way that everyone appreciates our hard work and generosity in their own way. Us taking care of a friend when they are sick could be reciprocated by said friend giving us encouragement. Everyone responds differently. I know that I wish people do what I do for them but it's never the case because we often give so much.\n\nDon't worry, you are not alone. Don't let these feelings get to you and change who you are.
1	I feel the same way most of the time.
2	The Fault In Our Stars, Hazel and Augustus, what MBTI types?	So I have been reading the Fault In Our Stars recently, and I admit I have a slight obsession for this book. Of course I have to analyze what MBTI types Hazel and Augustus are, and I kinda felt like when I was reading it, that Augustus is an ENTP, but not so sure about Hazel. I think there was a debate somewhere on personality café about whether Hazel is an INFP, ISFJ, or INFJ.. Anybody's thoughts?
2	Hazel: I N F J/P\nAugustus: E N F P/J\nFeel free to have a discourse :)
6	Isfj and deep thoughts	I'm an Isfj and I feel like I have a deeper thought process than what my personality "calls for". I love feeling like I figured out something most people don't pay attention to. I'm not sure if it's what I want to think or if it's actually true, yet I find myself looking for friends who can talk about in-depth things with me and looking for music that lyrically has a lot of hidden meanings and depth. I also really enjoy writing poetry, which is strange because I hate being creative and writing in any other form. I feel like I can express myself through poetry and I try to make it very symbolic and vague, so that of it is ever read, only people with depth would be able to analyze what it means to me. Most of the friends and family that I'm very close to are intuitive thinkers, so maybe they taught me to think in this way. Maybe my definition of in depth thinking is inaccurate. I'm just wondering if any fellow ISFJs can relate to this at all.
2	YESSS! I can so relate! It's almost like your drawn to intuitive people because of how interesting they are. I think it does have to do with the intuitive people around us, and how we have been brought up. I have always had a thing for poetry, but I am lacking in imagination, so instead I prefer reading poetry. Anyway, I think everybody tries to appear deep in some sense, but it doesn't necessarily make you any smarter than the norm. Personality only plays a part in intelligence, the rest is up to your environment, background, childhood, etc, and pushing yourself. \n\nAnyway, do you find Sensor people boring now? I got to a stage where I felt like I was changing from a sensor to an intuitive, always looking for a deeper meaning in everything, and I tried to talk to other Sensor's about deep things, but they never really seemed interested, so I ended up preferring to hang out with Intuitives, and taking on their way of thinking. As ISFJ's, it seems to me to be us trying to develop our inferior Ne
1	i like dissecting things if that counts. doesn't really make me feel like i have depth or anything though. i just like digging for meaning in movies and poems and art, it helps me understand how other people think or how other people communicate. plus i find it interesting how there are so many ways to express things and how there are so many ways to understand things.\n\nwhen i write poetry, i try to find ways to accurately express my emotions through vagueness? or in a way without having to detail every thought? so people can feel what i'm expressing even though they think differently than i do, even though they lived completely different lives and have completely different experiences than me. so, i'm trying to be more accurate to a wider audience. which is guess might be different than your trying to appeal specifically to those with depth, but i feel like there is a similarity in how we're trying to...do things. maybe they stem from a similar interest in expression and analyisis but differ in how we view other people?
1	I like to to do this sometimes and I personally think this is natural part of our tertiary Ti.
6	How is your dating? (x-post from INTJ)	Mine is horrible, either I'm too quiet and cold or I just can't seem to find someone whom I care about. How's your dating habits?
10	I'm sure my dating life would be fine, if I could actually find somebody to date.\n\nI've noticed that when I'm in public and a guy actually starts looking me over or giving me attention, I freeze up and get all awkward, and I tend to act like he isn't even there. Which obviously isn't very welcoming behavior or body language, so it doesn't tend to get me very far.
5	I tend to fall way too hard, way too fast and with the wrong person. I've had very few successful relationships because I try to please them even when I get nothing in return.
4	I have had issues meeting people. My first two bfs I met online thru mutually playing games together. Third I met irl at a party but after that initial meeting we did a lot of flirting/talking on facebook and on league before meeting up in person again. I find I am very awkward when first meeting people (in person) but if I am able to get to know someone online then I am more comfortable hanging out with them in-person afterwards.\n\nAs to how you are too quiet and cold, I think that I can come off this way as well. Especially if I am in a large group who is all chatting and I'm too uncomfortable to say something. So I just kind of sit and listen to everyone else talk, but later on everyone might be thinking "woah Gretay never said a single word... Wonder if she was in a bad mood... blah blah" instead of just realizing that I was just sitting and listening comfortably. I might have a resting-bitch face as well. *People just don't know the sweetheart I am on the inside!!!!* :p\n\nIn addition to these relationships, I also had a lot of FWBs and a few ONS during college. I think ISFJs are usually considered to be less ummm promiscuous but I had some bad experiences with sex and I also didn't have many friends in college so I used sex as a way to feel the touch of another person and just feel needed for a while.
5	I'd probably have a fine dating life if I ever left the house :P
3	Never dated or anything. But I also have extreme social anxiety and I'm questioning my sexuality so not sure if I even want to.
1	I've never dated, but on the bright side no one has ever complained so I guess I'm all good here!
1	I have an INTJ best friend whose logic determines his emotions, and thus, at age 24, he has never dated anyone. \n\nFor him, it has not yet been practical, and he refuses to lead someone romantically if there are too many impractical reasons to do so. 
1	Uhm dating.. What's that? \n\nI prefer to hang out with guys I am interested in. Then if it works out or there is chemistry it will turn to smth more anyway.
1	I make a great friend I guess. Girls I like generally don't want to date me but want to be friends that hangout all the time platonically. Which i'm OK with since they're cool people. But it makes me feel like something is wrong with me that makes me undatable.\n\nThe only girl I liked that was attracted to me as well was in an open relationship and then it became exclusive due to them getting an sti and not wanting to spread it.
1	I've never been on a date. I got a lot of dating apps (Tinder, POF, Zoosk, Match and OKCupid). I've matched with some girls but I'm always afraid to send them a message. I wouldn't have the balls to go up to a girl in public that I might have in interest in either.
1	ISFJ dating tends to go one of two ways:\n\n* being too scared to date\n* marrying the first guy who's not terrible *(optional)*
5	Are all of your friends intuitives?	I'm not sure if I am just in a place that has a high number of intuitives, but every single person that I have shown the test to end up as one. Currently I know an INFP, ENFP, ENTP and two INTJs, as well as having an ENTJ father and an IN/SFJ (not sure which one) mother. \n\nHonestly it is pretty interesting, cause while I have learned to communicate better with said people, there definitely feels sometimes (not as much with the first two but definitely with the others excluding my parents) like there is a bit of a disconnect when I'm talking to them. If that wasn't enough, there is a group of people who I'm trying to get to know better who I'm pretty sure are mostly N's also. I'm not even entirely sure how to act around sensors anymore cause I hardly ever talk to any. \n\nHow many intuitives do you guys know? And how do you guys act when surrounded by them? On a side note how different is it talking to sensors?
1	Yes. I actually love intuitives.\nThe only sensors in my life are my sister, and a couple of friends.\n\nOddly enough, I'm not very close to my sensor friends. I feel like we don't have very much to talk about, and things get shallow and stagnant pretty fast.\nIntuitives tend to be full of ideas, and they're usually willing to go a little bit deeper with their conversations, which I like. \n\nI tend to feel like I'm on a different wavelength from my sensor friends, more often than not.

4	Hi everyone.  I was having a pretty nice day, seeing someone improvement in myself over a week, and the day ended badly because of a specific event, and i was bummed, but when I when i stumbled upon this subreddit, i was so happy to meet more people like me, and more importantly, more ISFJs since i don't know any others in person.  Hope you all enjoyed this video.
1	Oh cool CelebrityTypes made videos of some types. I like all the animations and pictures. I hope they make videos of the other types sooner.\n\nThe descriptions they had and pointing out things that people may not know like how much we our inner impressions are matter a lot.\n\nGetting lots of satisfaction that I was able to help and see someone grow is something I really like a lot.\n\nPaints ISFJs in a very very positive light.\n\nThanks for the post.
5	Using our Si to the fullest in a positive way	One of the many unique things of (dominant) Si is our ability to be very attentive to the details and changes of our immediate physical environment\n\nThis can cause a lot of neat traits about us that I feel like can be a positive thing for others (such as easily remembering the little things about others you care about, being very patient and loyal, etc)\n\nHow does your Si (and perhaps with your Fe) positively help you with your life or do positive things?\n\nIm trying to think of other ways to use Si better outside being confident in my patience, loyalty and actually legit enjoying doing the small repetitive needs that not many else like to do.\n
2	I use it with Ti in order to improve accuracy of thought. i feel like every piece of information, every detail i notice is a lego block and i'm constantly putting these blocks together to form conclusions, trying to make them as perfectly and as smooth as possible. I'll find a piece, find a spot, stick it in, and do that over and over all day about everything.\n\nI use that together with Fe to get good at reading emotions via facial expressions and tone. So i know when a friend is in distress even if they're trying to hide it and i've become good at certain bluffing games like Coup or Resistance.

2	reminds me of this article i read recently about fixed or growth mindsets. where is says that if we are in a fixed mindset, we kind get of stuck examining and asking ourselves "are we good enough"? or "is that person good enough"?  while in a growth mindset we focus learning and changing and in turn decrease judgmental thoughts.\n\nhttps://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/

9	Careers helping others but suited for an introvert?	Hi,\n\nI'm currently working as an elementary teacher's aide and my day consists of starting work at 8, being exhausted by around 1PM and struggling to get through the rest of the work day to go home and "recharge" until bed. I'm currently in school for Family Studies/Human Development because I have a strong interest in family dynamics and how people learn as well as helping others. However, I am lost as to what career I can have from this degree when I don't want to work in the traditional "education"/public school environment and need time away from others to "recharge". Any help is appreciated!\n
3	I'd love to know the answer to this too, honestly
2	Maybe you could continue after a BS or a Master's to a doctorate, and possibly be hired by a university or company to conduct research on family dynamics and the such.\n\nDon't take my word as truth though, I'm not even in college yet :/
1	I was planning on going the clinical psychologist route. I can handle one-on-one or small group interactions for a decent amount of time, and I believe it'll progress beyond small talk, so I'm hoping it'll work for me. We'll see though!
1	I would suggest a psychology/therapy/life coaching career. One-on-one interactions are less draining than being in group settings, and you get to set your own schedules and expectations.
1	I know that this is an older post, but I recently subbed and have a chance to read through some posts.\n\nI am ISFJ and I am an Occupational Therapy Assistant (COTA) working with pediatric population. It is a great fit for me because I am one on one with kiddos all day, an hour at a time, helping them become as independent as possible in all aspects of their lives regardless of disability or diagnosis. It is challenging, but oh so rewarding when the hard work and dedication pays off when a patient progresses. I am surrounded by FJ personalities in my co-workers and my fellow COTA co-worker is also ISFJ, which is awesome. I just wanted to throw out that Occupational Therapy is a great fit for the introvert :).
14	Does anyone else feel a need to constantly "take care" of their S/O?	I feel like I always want to take care of my boyfriend, even if he doesn't need it. Stuff like always offering to make dinner or get up and grab drinks. I always want to feel like I'm a little bit needed, even for trivial things. My boyfriend does not expect any of this, and declines many of my offers. Does anyone else feel a need to do this? If so, does your partner take advantage of it?
9	This is the characteristic that I have loved most about the ISFJs that I have dated over the years. Nobody has the ability to make me feel truly loved, cherished, and *appreciated* the way you guys do. \n\n/u/LelanaSongwind \n> Yes, but my husband doesn't appreciate it nearly as much as I think he should... It's a point of contention in our relationship.\n\nOne of the hardest lessons I've ever learned is that I have *no* control over how another person feels or behaves, and that a corollary to that is that happiness is a choice that I can make for myself. If I stick my hand in a fire, it's going to be hot and hurt. Pretty much everything else in my emotional life is under my control. Based on your statement, it feels to me like at some level, you're taking care of your husband not because you want him to be well cared for (an action and emotion that is under your control), but because you want recognition for it from him (an action and emotion that is definitely *not* under your control). \n\nThis is what I don't love so much about the ISFJs that have been in my life. Some have been really great about being caretakers because they love having someone to take care of who gives back in other ways, while some have been great caretakers until they hit a magical and hidden tipping point where they feel that their efforts are not "appreciated enough" (or, in one case, not "reciprocated enough"). Nothing changed, but suddenly Houston, We Have A Problem. \n\nWelp. I am who I am. I speak physical touch and affirmation as my love languages. I'll hug you and kiss you and cuddle you and tell you I love you to the moon and back, but if you're dependent on hearing "thank you for (insert thing you do on the regular here)" on a consistent basis, you're going to be disappointed in the long run. I'm the guy who will *not* open the door for you 234 times because you're strong, talented, and capable of taking care of business (or we wouldn't be in a relationship), then I'll surprise you on times 235, 236, 237, and 243 by racing ahead and making a silly little show out of being chivalrous for you. \n\n_shrug_\n\nI have a serious love/hate relationship with ISFJs. 
7	Yes, but my husband doesn't appreciate it nearly as much as I think he should... It's a point of contention in our relationship. 
6	Sounds like I should date an ISFJ
3	yup! and he takes care of me too, although he's an ISTP :P 
2	Oh yes, I absolutely do this.  I like it.  My husband seems to like it too.  
2	My SO is chronically ill, the doctors have no idea whats wrong, but I felt the need to take care of him even before he was ill. We also did things like split chores and responsibilities. He's less capable now but he still makes dinner, does the dishes and does his best to take care of the house. He also goes out of his way to make sure I feel loved and appreciated.
2	Yep I do feel like this, and no my partner doesn't abuse it... I wish he'd accept it more bc offering/doing something like "want some water?" etc make me feel happy and useful haha.
2	i did with the first girl i fell for. it was very unhealthy though. she took, i gave. she was self centered, willfully ignored anything "unfun" and ignore responsibilities, and relied on me to handle stuff when they got out of hand. i had to break it off to figure out how to do my caring thing in a healthy way.\n\nas for feeling needed. i used to need that all the time. but that was also something i realized was unhealthy. it was a dependency on others for my self worth. and i worked through that by recognizing the joy i can feel in helping others without their recognition or approval. much like how i can feel happy for a friend who got a job or a promotion due to no influence from me. but then, if i can do something to improve their lives in such a way, i would, and i'm happy they're doing well. no need for being needed, only the enjoyment of making better the lives of those around me.
2	Yes! I'm an ISFJ (obviously) and when I love someone/am in a relationship with them, I want to "nurture" them! Stuff like "Do you want a snack? Do you need some water? Want a blanket? Do you feel sick? Are you feeling grouchy?" I love taking care of people I love.
1	ALL THE TIME! \n\nEven if my SO doesn't need it or is capable of doing things themselves, I always have this urge in need to take care of them. \n\nSome specific examples include:\nThey mentioned that they ran out of snacks *cue sudden urge to buy snacks for them*\n\nOr,  they have a headache *cue urge to bring them medicine*\n\nSometimes I wonder if I am doing too much but at the same time, I love it. My SO would rarely say thank you to me whenever I take these urges into action but lately they have been getting better at it! 
1	Sounds like codependency...
6	Meet Evan, the ISFJ!	
3	i recommend everyone to subscribe to him, he's great !
3	I found myself saying "wow, that's me!" to a lot of his different points. Gets an upvote from me :)

11	ISFJs and trying not to hurt people's feelings..sacrificing their happiness	Do ISFJs have a problem with being very polite that they don't want to hurt other people feelings even if those keep imposing their self on them, and keep nudging them in their price less "alone time"..this thing keep one of my relatives very stressed and intense  
7	I don't like hurting people's feelings, but if shit does go down I prefer a clean break.  (By clean break I mean completely cut off contact because it's not worth the emotional stress.)
3	I am the same way, I avoid conflict, so I never can tell someone "no I don't really want to talk to you right now"
1	yeah. it's a problem. i try to remind myself that "sacrificing happiness" isn't really a thing. it's more like i have a list of wants and if i don't get them all i feel bad. because if i decide to get my alone time i'll still feel bad if it meant hurting someone else's feelings, in a way i could say i sacrificed their happiness for my own.\n\nanyways, the wants are 1) don't hurt their feelings and 2) get my alone time. \n\nso the best solution i figured for these situations is me explaining to people in as honest and as detailed a way as possible, and in such a way that they can understand without getting mad or offended: how i feel, how i need my alone time, and how they are people i care about to X degree and am worried about hurting their feelings but i have my own priorities as well and i can't neglect my needs.
7	How to be good friends with ISFJs	Recently I've met an isfj who I think is interesting! It's hard to break her shell.. And the rare times that we do and click,  I feel happy! Her personality reminds me of a " black cage". I think we would totally balance each other out! (I'm an enfp) so how do I get her to open up? It can be hard communicating.
14	For me, I won't really open up until I know someone for some time. I don't like to share my feelings even with people I'm close with because I feel like a burden, so if you want an isfj to open up, it is probably best to try and bring up things that are relevant to her (or try to) and she will probably add on. That usually is how I start to open up to people.
6	Appreciate little details that you see her do, and make note of weird conversational ticks. Complement her in a non-intimate way. ISFJs love that shit. We subtly vie for attention from those we give everything to. Sometimes it falls short of our expectations and eats our consciences. Just appreciate your friendship together and spend time with her and I'm sure the openness will follow shortly.
3	I think I might have romantic feelings for my ISFJ friend...again	I'm INTJ and she's an ISFJ.\n\nI met her years ago, and near the beginning we both had a thing for each other.  Nothing ever materialized though cause I was young and dumb...I wasn't even that young, just dumb.  Nothing physical ever happened, but feelings were there until we got into an argument about something.  No clue what it was about now, but she said she hated me, and I completely shut down and ignored her for about a year or two.  I dismissed her partly cause I thought she was too emotional, but as I've grown these past few years, I realize emotions are valid, and not everyone is like me.  Throughout that time she constantly reached out, but I kept ignoring her.  Eventually we started talking again, but it's been on and off.\n\nShe lives in another city also, not too far (2 hour drive), but we've only hung out a handful of times.\n\nTwo years ago, she comes to visit after breaking up with her ex-boyfriend, and apparently she wanted sex or something but I didn't pick up the cues.  Anyway she goes back home, and tells me she's always had a thing for me blah blah blah.\n\nWe're on and off talking again the next few years and \n\nFastforward to now, she visits again, and we hang out, and all these feelings start rushing back for me.  She's left already but I'm thinking maybe I missed the signs again?  She kept trying to grab my butt, had her hands on my leg, or would tell me her hands are cold.  I grabbed her butt back maybe like once....and tried to flirt in my own INTJ way which probably failed.\n\nI've been reaching out to her since she left two days ago just chit chatting, talking random.  She posted a photo of us on instagram and facebook which caused a bunch of guys to question her about who I was (I don't know who these people are), and which also made her ex text her again (the one from earlier).\n\nI'm probably way overthinking but how can I see if she still has any sort of romantic feelings for me and/or tell her what I'm feeling?\n\nI know she's kind of casually dating (not exclusive) some guy but she doesn't seem too serious about it.\n\nMy thoughts are all over the place, but any help is appreciated.
3	if you're interested, you need to speak up and/or make plans to go see her. She's already coming out to visit and has mentioned interest, so you need to take a risk if thats what you want.  
6	What type(s) have you mistaked yourself as (if any) and how did you figure out you were actually an ISFJ?	When I was a MBTI test only n00b I usually got ISTJ. Whenever tests asked if I was more emotional/feeler vs logical I went with logical. \n\nHowever after researching functions and retaking tests afterward I realized my logical sense was more Ti based than Te based (I prefer understanding why things are instead of making sure things are objectively the way they should be)\n\nI realized F(e) doesn't necessarily mean you are overly emotional (which Im not) you just have your own personal subjective values you stick to when making decisions.\n\nI realized I have more conform-y "Fe"eler decision making as opposed to strong inner Fi values. In fact, Ive felt like my inner persona is almost nonexistent at some points in my life.\n\nI feel more satisfied when doing things that make people happy or making thing harmonious as opposed to making absolutely sure things are objectively the way they should be.\n\nMy Si has always been very strong so at least Ive always got that part right!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
3	I'm the same way, but depending on the test and my current mood, I'll get either ISFJ or ISTJ. I'm split almost exactly 50/50 between F and T, so it really can depend on the situation. I can be very analytical, but I also value other's feelings, and sometimes feelings trump the facts of a situation. I try to take both into account whenever possible though. I also like to make people happy and diffuse conflict. I feel like I'm accomplishing something that way.\n\nI've never really understood the Fe/Fi, Ne/Ni, Se/Si, Te/Ti thing though.
2	>F(e)...[means] you just have your own personal subjective values you stick to when making decisions.\n\nI thought that was Fi...
13	What's one sentence ISFJs would never say?	I saw this on another MBTI type thread, and it was really interesting. As ISFJs, what are things we'd never say?\n\nFor me, it'd have to be "I don't care"
45	 For me it's, "No, I can't help." Oh man, the stress that could be avoided if I could say this phrase...
27	"Let's go hang out in a huge crowd after work!"
28	"I really enjoy clubbing with a whole bunch of people I barely know!"
9	"Yeah I really don't care because that is not interesting to me, but there was this other thing that happened to me yesterday..."\n\n\nAlthough that would be a jerk move in any setting really
3	"That's your problem."
2	"do it yourself" 
7	What do you all do for a living?	I'm curious about what everyone on this sub does for a living, or if they are in college what they are majoring in. Do you like what you do? \n\nI'm going to be a senior in high school, so unfortunately I can't get the ball rolling, but I hope to go to college and major in political science (not entirely sure yet). I'm interested to see what fellow ISFJ's do, and find out if the stereotype that all of us are teachers or nurses holds true ;)
6	Currently I'm a Quality Assurance/Technical Analyst at a Computer Software Company
6	I'm in school for nursing. Very good field for ISFJ's. 
3	I'm in college studying Applied Math with a minor in Economics. I really enjoy taking my classes and when I graduate, will look for a career in actuarial science. This isn't the "expected" career choice for an ISFJ, but it fits me!
4	I'm currently working a laid back retail job and planning to go into a vet tech program. I've been really indecisive with what I want to go to school for and hopefully I won't change my mind again! 
4	Teacher, starting my 18th year.  Was a minister for ten years in the middle of those 18.  
5	I work at a business in my tiny tourist town. My job duties are many. I was originally hired to fill in until they hired a more experienced line cook for the restaurant, and then was moved to bakery and prep cook. I also work a few days a week at our kitschy gift shops, and occasionally lead school kids on tours, talking about local agriculture and pioneer lifestyle. \n\nI prefer working in the kitchen, in the back, where my interactions with strangers is less, but the retail aspect had helped me be (or at least appear) more gregarious, and my helpful nature fits well there. 
2	Administrative Assistant. Previously food service, retail, barista... lots of customer service. Majored in Economics and International Relations. Wanted to be a teacher when I was younger, so there's that stereotype :P\n\nCollege is a great time to experiment and explore. You’ll earn general education credits that count toward your degree, no matter what you major in. Just be aware that for some fields like engineering, courses have to be taken in a specific order. Most students change their majors as well. Good luck!
2	I start class on Monday for nursing. \nHow typical of me haha. \nBut in all reality, helping people fulfills me quite a bit more than anything else.
2	I am a nurse practitioner. :-)
2	I'm in grad school to become a speech-language pathologist :)
2	I'm an IT Project Coordinator.
2	Heading off to my first year of college soon - the plan is to become a clinical psychologist. I know it's a lot of talking to people (which can be draining for the introvert in me), but often it's one-on-one or in small groups, which I'm perfectly fine with.
2	I work as a Nursing unit assistant but going to school to be a nurse!\n
1	I'm a Land Surveyor. It's a pretty cool occupation. And I'm finishing up my general academics online in the fall and the spring. Soooo I'm pretty much living the adult life now lol.
1	I'm a computer programmer - but I now work as the computer programmer for a group of University Libraries and I am working on my masters degree part-time to become a librarian. 
11	Are ISFJ's prone to depression?	From a lot of the descriptions I've read, ISFJ's seem to need some sort of responsibility in their life to feel fulfilled. Like as a "guardian" you're supposed to be a great parent or whatever.\n\nI've struggled with depression since puberty, and I think one of the contributing factors is that ISFJ part of me that needs to be a "caretaker". After turning 25 this year, I've been feeling depressed, coming to grips with being alone most of my life, and thinking about how I probably won't have a spouse or kids to take care of in my future.\n\nAnyone else found this to be true for them? Or are you another ISFJ, but with a different experience with depression?
8	ISFJ here.\nI've never struggled with depression in my life.\nI have moments and periods in time when I feel very down, and I sort of hit rock bottom during those episodes.\nBut they're always short-lived, and I bounce back very fast and very dramatically.\n\nWhen I was younger, I remember I had sports coaches who made jokes about how I was smiling all the time. :)\nI'm generally a very happy person. \nI personally believe that happiness is a choice, and every single day, I make the choice to turn my thoughts in a positive direction. I know a lot of people think that sort of thing is a load of crap, but I'm a living example of how effective it is.\n\nIt's actually really simple, once you make a habit of it, and it can make such a huge difference in your life.\nI'm not gonna get all preachy about positive thinking, but if you're interested at all, I highly suggest googling it and at least giving it a shot.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I've never struggled with depression.\nI'm happy, I've always been happy, and I choose to make myself happy regardless of the circumstances I'm faced with in life.\n\nDon't get me wrong, my life isn't perfect and I've been through a whole lot of horrible things. But I gained something good out of every single experience I've ever had in my life, and I am who I am today because of it. So I wouldn't change a thing. :)
5	23 year old ISFJ guy here, and I'm in a very similar boat as you.\n\nI've struggled with moderate depression for many years. Sometimes it is worse than others, but it never seems to fade away.\n\nA lot of my distress comes from exactly what you describe as our need to be a caretaker, in my personal and professional life. For me this means being in a position to help people and provide them support, on a truly meaningful level.\n\nAs far as my personal life goes, I never seemed to develop strong social skills that translated into really meaningful relationships with friends or romantic partners. Thus, I've just never been able to take advantage of opportunities to create meaningful relationships. I would love to be a parent someday, and meet a woman I can really develop a deep and meaningful bond with, but everyday it looks(in my mind) more bleak. I realize this is an issue, and I try to work to fight it, but many times my efforts simply get derailed by my depression.\n\nI'm very fortunate to have a good job that I am fairly good at, and pays very well. However, I just don't feel like it is meaningful work. I work for a mid-sized corporation, who's bottom line is to create profit for shareholders(which is the case for all corporations). As cliche as it sounds, I really feel like I'm pouring my time and effort into working  for "the man" and their pocketbooks, rather than something truly meaningful to people's lives. Nearly everyday I feel like I come home form work unfulfilled. Some days I just feel like want to drop it all and pursue education for something completely different like social work, counseling, or nursing, just something that has a positive impact in people's lives. But, I'm afraid to give up the security I've already established. It can be overwhelming to think about, and can really be a demotivator.\n\nAt this point, I'm just not sure what to do other than live day by day, as unfulfilling as it may be. Feels bad man...\n\nI'm not sure what else I can offer you than my story and: I know what you're going through, and it really sucks. Take solace in the fact that you're not the only one experiencing these pains.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you want. It sounds like we have relate able experiences, and I'd be happy to talk through them with you.\n\nSorry for the rambling novel y'all...\n\n\n\n
3	I have struggled with it and I know where you are coming from. I think I have mostly come out of my depression, but I still lack one very basic thing... I have trouble realizing I must be my *own* caretaker. We are always looking for ways to help others often at the expense of ourselves. If we can learn to care for ourselves as much as we do others, then we would be so well off--look how well you treat others and decide you want the same care and attention as others receive from you. It is much easier said than done, I still cannot get the hang of it 100% but I feel that it is such an important thing... \n\nKind of rambling, but I hope what I said makes sense. \n\nBest of luck to you with handling hoe you are feeling! 
1	Other ISFJ there, male, atheist, & non-traditionalist.\n\n\nIt's been a while since you posted this thread, I don't know if you're still looking for answers. Anyway, may the following be useful for other ISFJ struggling with depression, I'll try to answer your thread.\n\n\nI've struggled with isolation most of my childhood, partly because of my very strong Si, because being a growing ISFJ child (kind, well-intended, interested in school,...), AND also for plenty of other reasons which have nothing to do with my being ISFJ (health, family,...).\n\nI've been struggling with depression since puberty as you seem to.\n\nBeing a caretaker is obviously part of it, yes. But not the only reason.\n\nI mean, being a caretaker, and a heterosexual not overmanly ISFJ man, is not the best option in the world, OK, so it contributes   :-)\n\nISFJs are often more easily/fastly tired than others (the "I" part of us having stg to do with it), that does not help as well\n\nBut well, I wouldn't be otherwise than ISFJ anyway, would you ?\n\nI'm now 40, I know who I am, and don't want to be SO else.\n\nI just face being who I am, and trying to get the best of it for others. And the "not too bad" of it for myself.\n\n\nBut being an ISFJ is not all about my struggling with depression. Health is a part of it (e.g. thyroid issues). Family story is part of it as well. Some non-typical-ISFJ mental traits of mine are part of it as well.\n\n\nI've been married to an INTJ woman for 15 years (ongoing divorce by now), but I've only been knowing anything about MBTI for 2 years; that helps me understand some things (with no hope at all that MBTI would explain everything !!! How unsane would that be...).\n\n\nPlease give others the best of being an ISFJ: give your best to any persons who deserve it, without, eeeer... being a carpet, which us ISFJs seem to be veeery good at.\n\nBeing 25, you have an incredible potential and amount of time to meet a marvellous SO who will also be full of flaws, with whom to have wonderful children !!! Who will themselves struggle their whole lifetime with their own bunch of issues...\n\nI married at 25, which is no problem at all, as well as the idea of, would I meet a special SO again, marrying again in the next few years would not be a problem for me either !\n\n\nWhat I think for you is: \n\n1. Ask for help, see a therapist, and take it seriously. If this therapist does not fit you, look for another, without jumping constantly from one to another: once you've found an acceptable one, keep them until you feel you don't need therapy anymore.\n\n2. Go on improving yourself, the way that is good for you. Some ISFJs will prefer working of toughening themselves to counterbalance their kindness, others will try to constantly improve their "helping others" toolbox, and so on...\n\nGo on becoming the person you wish to be, THIS will be romantically attractive, but only to the persons who will fit you, which is sometimes a good filter against harmful persons   :-)\n\n3. We're not helped with common representations (fictional, specially) of love, whatever MBTI type we are; get these images out of your head (age for marrying, way to fall in love, way to stay/live together,...)\n\n4. Beware of takers; "givers must set limit, because takers don't". Ask for help ending harmful relationships if you observe you don't manage that by yourself. There's not shame to have about that.\n\n5. Open up: we ISFJs are often under-the-radar persons, who look smart but distant, so try to balance it with other stuff in order to lower the barrier it makes.\n\n\nPlease keep on being the best person you can, AND do what's necessary in order to attract the right person. Whatever physically attractive you are, whatever 'old' you are, whatever flaws you feel you have, that'll make it    :-)\n\n\nAlso, the Internet is full of helpful articles & posts which may bring you comfort and help.\n\n\nYou can contact me via PM or through the forum, would you feel the need to have this discussion going on.\n\n\nI wish the best for you !!!\n\n\n\nPierre-Yves
2	Is it normal for you to listen and pretend you're zoning out?	Everybody has does this now and then but ISFJs I know seem to do this thing where they seem like they're listening but when addressed, will say that they didn't hear what everyone was talking about and it will need to be repeated. Aside from when you actually zone out, does this sound like ISFJ behavior? To listen but say you weren't? \n\nI'm not talking about eavesdropping either, but a conversation you're technically apart of.
3	I think a lot of introverts generally do this? Not sure though, I'm an INTP btw
2	Sometimes I can genuinely zone out. It's not me pretending to zone out I just honestly do. I think it would be strange to lie by listening then saying I hadn't listened only to make someone repeat it... \n\nSometimes I do ask for clarification as I want to be completely sure I understand what was said. So I might hear something once but not comprehend it so I say "can you explain that again, I don't really understand what you meant."
3	Best Type of Us?	Hey fellow ISFJs, what type do you think is the best for us (compatibility) wise, and why? 
6	To be honest, I don't know if we have an ideal match.\nI'll just list my experiences with different types, for examples. It varies from person to person though, and these are solely my own personal experiences, so I'm sure other people feel differently.\n\nI get along very well with INFJs, and they're very kind people, but I don't find myself very attracted to them. I also find that their desire to always talk about deep things can drain me sometimes.\n\nI love INFPs, but I wouldn't want to date them. I feel like their form of doting affection (and need for affection) would make me feel smothered.\n\nI love ISFPs but I often feel like we don't really connect super deeply, and we see the world quite differently.\n\nINTPs have so far been my best match, but we also tend to have conflicts, and some differences that cause tension and problems.\n\nRecently I met an ENTJ, and to my surprise and amazement, we get along very very well.\nHe's funny, he's intelligent, he's surprisingly tolerant and kind so far. He's extremely fun to talk to, and he brings out the best in me.\nWe have common goals and desires, and we see the world similarly. However, I can see that he already has pretty bad controlling tendencies, and it makes me uncomfortable, so I doubt I'd be happy with him over the long run.\n\nI do like other ISFJs, but I feel like things can get quite stagnant between us, and we run out of things to talk about fairly quickly, because our relationship tends to be fairly shallow and lacking in depth, passion or closeness. \n\nMost extroverts tend to make me feel smothered and bulldozed-over, and they don't usually understand my desire for personal space and privacy, so I find them often quite exhausting, and I doubt I would enjoy a relationship with them.\n\nISTPs just seem too harsh and shallow to me. (Probably a harsh generalization, and I'm sorry if it offends anybody, but I haven't had great experiences with them in the past.)\n\nA lot of types also tend to be commitment-phobic, or have tendencies toward infidelity, which I would be crushed by.\n\nI haven't ever really had any close relationships with ISTJs or INTJs, so I can't offer my input on those types, as well as most extroverts, because typically I avoid them when it comes to romance.\n\nObviously, you can't base romance and compatibility on MBTI typing alone. Sometimes the chemistry is there, sometimes it isn't. People vary tremendously despite their types, and I tend to see it as more of a loose guideline to help me relate to, understand and function with different people. \n\nIf I had to pick my ideal type to be in a relationship with, honestly, I would probably pick INTPs. But a lot of them tend to dislike ISFJs, and I find some of them can be a little bit too cold and logical, and they intimidate me. Still, my best relationship experiences have been with them, and I've always felt like I connect with them on a level I never have with anybody else. I'm typically really, really attracted to them, too.\n\n**TL;DR** I think it varies from person to person. For me, I'm gonna say INTPs. But I believe two people from any type can have a healthy, functional relationship as long as both people are healthy and functional themselves, and the proper chemistry is there.

8	Am i a INFJ or ISFJ? (or something else?)	Hello! Please solve me, the human riddle These are my facts, who am i? (You tell me because i have no idea except for the facts that im probably a Fe user and a introvert)\n\nA couple weeks ago i smelt a specific smell and i imidiately remembered that it was the exact same smell as the one in a playhouse i played in once when i was 10.\nWhen doing things i sometimes get what i can only describe as flashbacks to how i did it the last time or a memory of me doing something similiar\n\nI can sometimes remember completely random things from years back but overall have pretty bad memory\n\nI sometimes just know what my family members or close friends will say before they say it. Example: My mother: didn't you want to do a... Me: moodboard We hadn't talked about it in over 6 months and our conversation beforehand had nothing to do with the topic And once when my mother told me a story about when she went to visit a friend and i just knew that the story would end with her friends dog jumping into my mothers car (That sort of things does not happen that often) but i can often finish peoples sentences or know what people will say next without knowing the exact words they'll use\n\nI have a big tendency to forget to eat when im in the middle of some intresting project, and am not really in touch with my bodily needs and rarely feel sensations such as hunger, sleepiness, thirst etc.\nWhen i am bored i have a big tendency to over eat\nIt was only at the age of 16 that i started noticing smells often, when i was younger i always thought that i just had a really poor sense of smell, but apparently not. I also never consider other peoples bodily needs because of it (them being cold, hungry, thirsty etc)\n\ni am very absentminded. I often walk into a room and forgot why i went there in the first place, put toast in the toaster and forget that i did, the same with tea. It can also be music playing  without me noticing.All because im always in my head thinking about something else.\n\nI often get annoyed when people never get to the point in conversation but just give loads of useless details\n\nI've always been very curious and asked loads of questions as a child Why does your nails get blue when your cold? If jesus died for our sins can we just sin as much as we want? How does rice grow? On bushes? Individualy?\n\nIm fairly good at noticing change. Like if someine has gotten a new haircut, if some trees has been cut down since last time i visited a place etc\n\nWhen laying in bed at night i tend to have a thousand ideas and other things pop into my head\nI am a big procrastinator and work in bursts on energy instead of a consistent planned flow\nI am not at all a creature of habit and is very inconsistent in my routines. I can decide that I'll start doing something everyday and two days later ill abandon it. Another example is deciding a theme for home decor and then changing my mind because suddenly having loads of palm trees inside seems so much better than strict minimalism! (lol)\n\nI am very messy\n\nI also do not enjoy following a strict sceduale but instead tend to plan roughly improvise as i go I often get accused of trying to reinvent the wheel because im coming up with new and better ways to do things\n\nMy way of making desicions (for example if im going to buy a shirt or not) read all the facts, think about do i have enough money for this? Will i use it? Can i use it often? What other things will i have to sacrifice by spending money on this? How much do i like it? And then i just go with the gut. Though i pretty often make irrational decisitions based on emotions\n\nI have a wierd relationship with feelings. Sometimes im super emotional and can really empathise with anyone, the next i can't sympathise with anyone and consider the feeling of myself and others lame and overly dramatic. I also tend to feel a bit disconnected from my feelings sometimes, like my body is crying but on the inside im just wondering what the heck im doing\n\nI am very good at being Fe style appropriate as i don't like fighting with people, i also sometimes tend to cry during harsh discussions (that's emberassing for me to admit)\n\nI enjoy discussing topics such as philosophy and politics, things you really have to discuss and think about unlike talking about that camping trip your friend took last weekend or your new hairstyle. Though i am fully capable of talking about such things\n\nI will always step into the leader position if it's available, and can be quite dominating at times. I am also very competitive, but only compete if i think i can win.\n\nI hate smalltalk\n\nSorry for the messy post!\nThanks for trying to help me out!
3	> A couple weeks ago i smelt a specific smell and i imidiately remembered that it was the exact same smell as the one in a playhouse i played in once when i was 10. When doing things i sometimes get what i can only describe as flashbacks to how i did it the last time or a memory of me doing something similiar\n\n\nThis is a perfect example of the function Si, or Introverted Sensing, which involves personal memories and feelings towards one's own history. Reading over your post, you provide a few definite examples of using Si, and consequently of definitely NOT using Se which would be being active and engaged in the present moment. I also agree that you are definitely an Fe user based on feeling disconnect with your own feelings more so than disconnect with others. Si and Fe are the two dominant functions of ISFJs, so that's probably your type! (I'm a semi-lurker INFP myself haha but welcome!)\n\n\nINFJs would also use Fe but are dominated by a function called Ni, which I'm honestly terrible at describing because I don't have it myself, but it involves synthesizing knowledge/observations into one conclusion, or starting with many ideas and ending up with one idea. It is the opposite of Ne, which would be used by an ISFJ, to start with one idea and explore all the possibilities related to that idea, or starting with one idea and ending up with many. So your identification, or lack thereof, with either of those functions (Ni vs. Ne) could be a hint as well as to what type you are.\n\n\nI recommend you look up some good descriptions of the Si function to clarify/confirm, but I think you will relate to it based on your post :) Hope this helps!
1	You have just described me better than I have ever described myself. But to add to it, often i'm slow at doing a task. As it has to be done right but if it's boring I go off into my own little world for a minute or two without even realising. Does this happen to you?\n\nI did the test and was laughing at the description it gave of ISFJ as it was so much like me.
4	Favorite movies?	Following up on the music threads we have all posted semi-recently, I was wondering what all of your favorite movies and movie genres are. I'll get the ball rolling by going first:\n\nMy favorite genre tends to be sci-fi, but with a dystopian twist. My favorite movies are Children of Men and District 9. I also like comedies a lot (but most aren't very good imo), the best one I've seen in a while was What We Do In The Shadows, a spoof on Vampire flicks. \n\n\nWhat do you guys like?
3	One of my favorite comedies is Idiocracy and is somewhat dystopian. District 9 is a good movie and Children of Men wasn't bad either. As far as other dystopian movies go I have seen all the Mad Max movies and have been a fan for a long time. Have you seen A boy and His Dog, THX 1138, or Gattica? Those are also dystopian and not necessarily post-apcolyptic. I'm just an INTP passing buy that has similar movie interests.
3	My favorite genres are drama and action. I much prefer TV series over movies. However, if I were to put together a list of movirs specifically this would be it:\n\n1. The Man from Nowhere\n2. Black Hawk Down\n3. Gladiator\n4. I Saw the Devil\n5. Kingdom of Heaven\n\n\nI really like violent/war movies, but that is the complete opposite of what my philosphy is, in reality...\n
3	* Moon\n* Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\n* Good Will Hunting\n* Shame
3	1) The Dark Knight\n\n2) Spiderman 2 (2004)\n\n3) Interstellar\n\n4) Spanglish\n\n5) Man on Fire\n\n6) Catch Me If You Can
2	I'm really really into war movies. Especially WWII. I also love mobster movies.\n\nMy all-time favorites are probably Goodfellas, Saving Private Ryan, Flyboys, Pearl Harbor and Lone Survivor. \n\nIf a miniseries counts, then definitely Band Of Brothers and The Pacific.
1	Blade Runner, closely followed by Alien.
1	The Perks of Being a Wallflower. 
4	ENTJ trying to befriend ISFJ	I've known an ISFJ for half a year now and I think we click quite well but he seems very shy at social events and more often than not isn't willing to step out of his comfort zone.\n\n\nany advice on how I can help him out in that regard and is there any material that he may find interesting or helpful like books etc?\n\n\nwhat do you all generally think of ENTJs? I would love to read some of your experiences and interactions with ENTJ! \n\n\nhe has also agreed to come for social events and make new friends the next time I ask him out so that's good progress I think! 
5	Hi! Isfj here! I am in a relationship with an entj and we have been together 5 year and will also be getting married next year! So isfjs and entjs make good friends/companions as I feel he is also my best friend =) with what you are concerned about you must understand the difference between and extrovert and and introvert. You as an extrovert get energized being around people while for an introvert it takes energy away from from them to be around people. With this in mind yes introverts can be around people but not for extended periods of time. So you should take that in to consideration with you are out with your isfj. It also seems that your isfj friend is willing to go out with you if you are with them so don't try to push them to hard and expect them to act like a extrovert. I hope I have helped! 
2	Entj with isfj sibling here. My advice is: run while you can. The J clash is horrendous, I have a lifetime of experience; save yourself the trouble haha.\n\nThough one of my best friends is also isfj. So in all seriousness: Isfj are quiet and loyal but sensitive, they work so hard for romantic relationships and friendships, almost to the point that they put them before family. They seem to cling to whoever is nicest to them. And they like small nice gestures. They have a lot of trouble letting go, almost to an obsessive degree. Just be aware of this and good luck not stepping on their toes cuz they hold grudges forever.\n\nI myself am dating an istj... replace the f function with a t function and now you have something much more compatible with entj.\n\nSorry this answer is not as encouraging as you would have wanted.

2	Relationship advice wanted	Hello, I am an isfj seeking out a relationship with a girl, we'll call her Sarah.A little back story to me, im 19 years old and haven't ever met a person that I've really wanted to be in a relationship with. That is, until I got to know Sarah a bit better through work.I nervously asked Sarah if she would go out on a date with me and was really surprised when she said yes. *no way, she's given me a chance!*On the date I had a really good time and found out that me and Sarah have a scary amount of things in common. She gave no hints as to if she was also having a good time or not, and im probably over thinking all this but im not sure if she feels the same way about me. I keep debating with myself over whether she was just being nice and went along with all of it to let me down easy or if she genuinely sees a possibility at a relationship/friendship.I've only seen her at work for a few moments since our date and we haven't had much time to talk. She doesn't reply to my texts where I attempt to form plans for a second meeting. I've tried calling her twice on separate days just to have no answer and no call back.Is there anything I can do to fix this? When I see her at work, though its rare, its always been the high point of my day. I feel really happy when im around her and feel like I can just be my completely honest self without fear of judgement.I know its probably abnormal to have these emotions for someone I've had limited contact with but they're real and they're something I can't stop. I've never been in this kind of situation before and I really would appreciate any advice, even if its the harsh truth
1	I have definitely always idealized (to some extent) the people I am after. It's not the best trait to have, because you become engrossed with them, heavily infatuated with them, etc after just a short amount of time. Rereading texts multiple times before sending them, wondering why they haven't answered, wondering what they think of you--but at the same time, not really broaching the subject.\n\nTo me, it sounds like she is no longer interested in you. I am not sure why, but if she has not replied to texts/calls within a week (and even that is a stretch)--then she probably does not want to. I think it would be best to send one more last text, simply explaining: "Hey, I had a great time on our date. From your lack of response, I'm assuming you don't want to go out again--but just for my own personal benefit can you let me know what I did wrong, or was it just a lack of chemistry?" (even this is phrased weirdly, but I think something like this gets the point across, doesn't pressure her, and still gets you a bit of an answer to your question). Again, this is all assuming it has been about a week since your date and she has still not replied. There's no guarantee she will even reply to this, but in that case I would definitely try to get over her as best you can. Try not to idealize her and stay infatuated with someone who is not feeling the same towards you. Also, do not let this one experience get you too down. I am happy you were brave enough to ask her in the first place, that can be really tough. And there is a girl out there who will go on a date with you and want to go on many more :)\n\nI will also let you know I was in a somewhat similar situation with my SO in the beginning and I would have saved myself a lot of trouble if I had just asked him early on "Hey, I'm kind of confused about what we are. Can we talk about it?" rather than just overthinking things in my head (but at the same time not acting on these thoughts) for months.
1	She's not interested, move on brother. Been there, done that, it sucks.\n\nIt happens.
4	ISFJ struggling with breakup	I'm a ISFJ in my mid-twenties who has semi-recently been broken up with by my boyfriend (who I believe to be an EFSJ). We were friends beforehand, and then dated for a year. We had talked very seriously about marriage and our future. He blamed the whole break up on himself, struggling with self-worth and wrongly seeking female affirmation, all the while praising and complimenting me for who I am as a person. \n\nWe said we would remain friends while he went through his identity crisis, but he told me I'd have to be the one to reach out to maintain the friendship because he needed to focus on himself and didn't want to give me false hope that we would definitely get back together at the end of all of it. I tried for the first two months, but never really felt like he was trying to invest in this friendship he claimed he wanted. He was always excited to see me in person, but over text, fb, etc. he was always very disconnected. Now, we haven't spoken in a month and I feel devastated -- not only that the relationship is over, but also he doesn't even seem to want to be friends. But that might just be me over analyzing. My personality wants to keep reaching out to him and stay loyal, but as a ISFJ woman I just so desperately want to be pursued and affirmed in someway (no matter how small). I feel like everything has been so vague and unclear, and that's why I'm going crazy. \n\nI know as ISFJs, we have difficulty with change and letting go of the past. I also know we hold relationships as such a high priority in our lives, to the point that we would be willing to wait forever for someone we love. I guess I'm at a loss right now. Especially, when he told me how great I was, but now won't initiate any interaction with me...and somehow, I'm the one who feels guilty about that. \n\nI feel like I'm ranting, but can anyone relate to any of that? Any advice? Any suggestions? Any experience with ESFJ's to know what's going on with him? How do we ISFJ's handle these kind of break ups? Because I really feel all over the place. 
2	break-ups are hard, especially if there isn't an obvious reason.  how he acts shouldn't be taken as a reflection on you or on the now-past relationship, so don't feel guilty or wonder why.  i find it's easier if you make some physical and emotional distance after a break-up.  trying to be friends immediately after isn't really fair to either person (especially if you still secretly want to get back together).  you can still value the past relationship and feelings - just remember that it's in the past, and you need to keep moving forward.
2	It's really, *really* difficult, if not impossible,  for most guys to remain friends after. We can't easily disassociate the emotions we feel with just being friends after; it's very "all or nothing" in that sense (either we're with you, or we're not. There is no in between). There are rare exceptions, but this is usually the case.\n\nI don't have any advice with how you can cope, all I can say is don't feel bad. You didn't do anything wrong, and there was nothing you could have done to alter what has happened.\n\n[I'll leave you with one of my favorite comics and hope you'll feel slightly less shitty in time.](http://zenpencils.com/comic/141-albert-camus-the-middle-of-winter/)\n\nGl hf ♥\n\n
2	I feel for you girl.....I tell my ISFJ wife when she gets into this sort of brain loop that I want to use my shrink ray and turn her into a baby sized version of herself (not baby but adult proportions just baby size) and put her into a snuggie and carry her around all safe and warm.  \n\nI will say this.....if you are anything like my ISFJ then you are smart and your brain is good and will figure this out in time.  Just be patient and believe in yourself.\n\nShe loved the song "All Ends Well" by Alter Bridge.  \n\nYou got this girl, just be you....be authentic and believe in yourself.
1	ESFJs, while genuine, are fairly shallow in the sense that it is difficult for them to be in unhappy situations. They generally do not enjoy getting deep into discussing for feeling intense emotions/ideas. He may have said he wanted to be friends with you because he knew that would make you happy (because ESFJs are definitely people-pleasers), but actually being around you and feeling sad is too much for him. The loyalty of an ISFJ can be their greatest strength and their greatest weakness. Wanting to believe the best of someone and wanting to give people second chances (and third, and fourth, and fifth for that matter) often causes more damage than intended. ISFJs tend to have very kind and pure intentions; however, there are plenty of people out there who do not like to or do not want to deal with feeling bad about something. An ISFJ continually being forgiving and kind will often make someone on the receiving end feel worse even when the intention is to make them feel better. All that being said, keep being a caring person, but recognize when to move on and let others be in charge of their own emotions. And (difficult as it may be) really try not to take it personally. 
5	Need a ton of advice on my future career	I believe I'm an ISFJ and I'm thinking about becoming an italian teacher (I'm a native speaker) in the USA. I have permanent residence and I'll soon have work authorization as well. I heard lots of nice comments from Americans about Italian people and the italian language. My main concern is that I might have hard time dealing with some students given the I'm an ISFJ. I'm very sensitive and I can get embarrassed pretty easily (for example if I make a mistake) . I'm not sure I would be okay with speaking in front of lots of people. On the other hand, I love languages and this is my main passion so I don't know what else I could do. I'm also assuming that most of my future students would be friendly and really interested in learning since Italian is not a language that is commonly taught (such as Spanish) - so if they choose it, it means that they are willing to work hard. As a student I was always shy and I remember how difficult some of my classmates were to deal with from the teacher's perspective. I read online that ISFJs are perfect teachers for kids because we're patient and caring, but I don't know about high-school. Should I consider getting a master to teach in college so that I deal with older students? I'm also thinking that it might be difficult at first but after some years I'll get used to it. Thoughts?
3	I'm a foreign language teaching ISFJ! I did get a masters but with a certification so I could teach in public schools. My youngest student was 3 and my oldest 85. I'm surprised that teaching middle school age is my favorite with adults a close second. Because I love it so much, I don't get the anxiety that I get with other things. Like you said, people will take Italian because they want to know. There's a shared interest. And making a mistake isn't really that big a deal. Just be meek enough to correct it as soon as you notice. Now I'm working with refugees and other migrants. It's rewarding while still using my specific skills. Becoming a teacher was the single best thing I've ever done. Maybe you should tutor before you make a final decision. Your ISFJ patience could be a huge asset. 
3	Recently broke up with my ISFJ gf, how badly have I broken her?	So I am an INTJ and I met my ISFJ girlfriend when we were in high school. We have dated for 7.5 years and been through a lot together, including a few years of long distance. She moved overseas 18 months ago and we have been trying to make it work, she says it has been working for her and she always spoke about our future together, however for the last while I haven't been feeling it and even though I tried my hardest I eventually took the step and ended it. \n\nIt was not easy for me as she is my best friend and we have largely shape each other into the people we are today. I know she is very angry with me and very hurt, which I understand but I am worried about her. She was in a very good place, she loves her job and was probably the happiest I have ever seen her, so I am worried that i may have broken this.\n\nI guess all I want to know is will she ever forgive me? Will she be ok in the long run? Any sort of advice from other ISFJs that have been through a long term breakup. How can I make it easier for her? Should I distance myself, should I remind her I still care about her? \n\nI like to believe that one day we could be friends again, as I don't see how we can just throw everything we have built over the last 7yrs away, are any of you friends with your exs?
10	I've actually just gone through a remarkably similar situation.\nIt's been 2 months since he left me, and we've had no contact for over a month. \n\nI don't harbor any ill feelings towards him. Am I sad that he threw away so many years together so easily? Of course. Do I wish things could be different? Absolutely. \nBut I don't blame him for it.\n\nI personally believe that everybody is only doing the best they can with whatever they're given in life. Of course there are moments where I feel mad at him for it, or I just fall apart and need to cry my eyes out for a few hours. But it gets easier with every day that passes.\n\nISFJs do have a hard time leaving the past behind us. I haven't gone a single day without thinking of him, and I miss him like hell. But all I want is for him to be happy.\nWhen you love somebody, their happiness becomes more important than your own. I still have hope that we might have a chance at some point, way down the road, when we're both at different places in our lives.\nBut if not, that's okay too. As long as he's happy and healthy.\n\nI do think staying friends could make it easier on her, but it also might be worse. Because it's really hard to be friends with somebody you're attracted to, and have so much history with. \n\nMy biggest advice would be to make sure you're not leading her on.\nIf you don't have any intentions of being with her in the future, don't imply that you do. ISFJs can hold on to that kind of thing, and at least in my case, I know I'd be willing to wait forever for somebody that I loved, which would consequently mean putting my life on hold in the process.\n\nBe kind to her. Hostility or coldness from you is going to hurt her really badly. Explain in detail why you did it, and what your thoughts/feelings on the whole situation are.\nDon't let her try to talk you out of it, but definitely make sure you've explained it all in depth.\n\nFor me, the worst part was both the confusion, and not understanding why he did it, because he barely explained, and also losing my best friend.\nFor ISFJs, our romantic partners tend to be the very top, most important part of the totem pole in our lives. Which is not necessarily a good thing, because sometimes we abandon the other things in our life to focus on that person. We literally live for love.\n\nIs she going to be okay in the long run? Well, I don't know her personally, so I don't know how she handles this sort of situation. I'm inclined to say that yes, she will be okay, she'll forgive you and she'll recover from this in time. \n\nLet her have her emotions. I was very hysterical when it happened to me, and in hindsight, I probably made things worse by flipping out and saying/doing things I wouldn't normally do. \nTry not to judge her if she's not herself. Her world has been sort of flipped upside down. \n\nISFJs are usually pretty forgiving people, I think. Especially if we love you. We're willing to let people get away with a lot, if we genuinely care about them.\nGive her time.\nIt's up to you whether or not friendship would be a wise idea. I have mixed feelings on it.\n\nI sincerely wish you luck, and I'm so sorry your situation ended up the way it has.
2	First of all, I'm really sorry about the breakup. That stuff is never fun, especially if y'all truly care about each other. \n\nNot as long as yours, but my boyfriend of 3 years broke up with me a year ago. He insisted on staying friends, and we kept talking. However, I really wish he didn't talk to me for a week or two because it was painful to be reminded of him. I only accepted it because I was terrified of losing a friend. A year later, I'm back to my happy self, and we're still good friends!\n\nAs long as it wasn't a nasty breakup, I don't see why y'all can't be friends. I would say distance yourself for a little bit but remind her you're still there for her. Then again, she could be different from me so honestly talking about it could make it easier. It will take time for her to be okay, but she will be okay in the long run! 
5	ENTP here.. ISFJ thoughts on ENTPs please?	Those of you who know ENTPs in real life, online, or through reading type descriptions (please specify which), what do you think of us?  Speak your minds, don't worry about offending any of us xD
6	The only ENTP I've ever been close to is my older brother.\nI really adore him, but our personalities clash a lot. \n\nIt was much worse when we were young. We fought like cats and dogs, and we couldn't even stand to be in the same room with each other without arguing.\n\nNow that we're both getting older, we've mellowed out and it's much easier to hang out with each other. We do still argue if we're around each other for prolonged periods of time, but mostly there's just a lot of good-natured ribbing and sarcastic insults.\n\nThere are a lot of traits I admire in him. He's always seemed so confident and outgoing, and I've picked up a lot of social cues/behaviors from him, growing up.\nI envy him for his independence.\n\nHe's extremely funny, and nobody has ever been able to make me laugh as hard as he can. When I'm hanging out with him, he frequently makes me laugh so hard I cry.\n\nHe's a very genuine, loving, trusting person. A lot of people do take advantage of that. He has a desire to help people, and he trusts people really quickly after meeting them, so of course there are always needy, toxic people who see that in him and manipulate him through that. They play the wounded victim, and he tends to jump in and try to rescue them, without considering what this person is like, or what they're taking from him.\n\nHe's very generous. My brother was always offering to take me places or buy me food and stuff when we were younger. \nHe's always been extremely protective of my sister and me, and I've always felt safer when he's around. He'd never let anybody hurt either of us, and there have definitely been a lot of situations where somebody was bullying one of us, and we didn't have the courage to stand up to them, so my brother did it for us.\n\nHe cares a lot about his hygiene and appearance. Which really sucked when I had to share a bathroom with him. Now that he's moved out, though, it's not a problem. I'm never ashamed to be seen in public with him, so that's a bonus.\n\nHe's a little bit of a chameleon-type, and he definitely tries very hard to fit in, which often involves repressing his own personality, interests and desires.\nFor example, if he gets a new girlfriend, he tends to adapt his interests to match hers, and he'll listen to the same music, watch the same movies and shows, dress more like she does, etc; even if he was never into those things before.\n\nHe struggles with depression and anxiety, although I think that's more likely due to our upbringing than his personality type, as we were raised in a pretty dysfunctional home environment.\n\nMy brother has definitely been good for thickening my skin over the years. I learned how to let a lot of things slide, and I like to think I'm less offended by arguments or criticism after living with him for so long.\n\nWhen we argue, we butted heads really bad, and we were both too stubborn to give up, so he helped me learn to stand my ground with people. \n\nI love him a ton, and I look up to him a lot.\nThat being said, I would never want to be in an intimate relationship with an ENTP, personally.\nI read about a lot of ISFJs ending up with them, and I could never do it. The constant conflict would be exhausting.\nPlus, I have a hard time being around extroverts for too long, and they drain me.\nINTPs, on the other hand, I've been with and really loved. They're similar enough to ENTPs while still being introverted and needing their own time/space.\n\n\nTL;DR:\nENTPs are lovely people. Confident, funny, kind, witty, extremely intelligent, boisterous, the life of the party. But they also love to argue with people, and I'm too stubborn to be able to handle that in large doses.\n
2	My fella of 6 years is an ENTP. Our friends say we complement and balance each other. \n\nWe have some major issues, which frequently arise, but we work on them more often than we used to. Generally, the issues stem from an imbalance of consideration for the other's needs. \n\nMost of the time, we get along well.\n\nOccasionally, though, I wonder if this relationship will destroy me.\n

3	What're your favorite types of music?	Hello, I recently found about personality types, so I took a quiz, and here I am! I guess it's needless to say that I'm curious about finding out more about myself as well as others, so I want to know; Is there a correlation in the types of music certain personality types like? Let me know what your favorite type(s) of music is/are.
3	I love EDM, but I'm pretty open to all music.
2	I'm pretty open-minded when it comes to music. I have a little bit of everything, although I'm really not big on rap/hip hop, or electronic music.\n\nMy favorite artists right now are Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, Rise Against, The Gaslight Anthem and Green Day, just to name a few.\n\nBut like I said, I have a little bit of everything.
2	I listen to two main types of music:\n\n1. Rock, particularly hard rock, like System of a Down(which is definitely one of my favorites). This is usually reserved for my gym session, but sometimes I'll feel a bit energetic and put it on in the car.\n\n2. Far and away my favorite genre, Trance. I like EDM style music in general, but the slower beats of trance are my shit. Here's an example of one of my favorite tracks: [Willem de Roo - Velvet Destiny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eewqGtoh7UY). I also love to listen to A State of Trance my Armin Van Buuren\n\n\nI'm pretty simple when it comes to music. I'm not a huge fan of the music scene; I just love to listen. \n
2	Calming melodic feel good music
1	If I had to choose, my favorite type of music would be jazz. I am a saxophone player and I really love the stuff. Other than that, I'm not crazy picky. I enjoy listening to anything from classical to classic rock! 
1	EDM, specifically in the Future Bass genre which isn't really that dance heavy (it should really just be called Electronic...).\n\nSome producers that I highly recommend you listen to if you are interested (Most/All have Soundcloud, Youtube, or both): [Sweater Beats,](https://soundcloud.com/sweaters) [Saturn,](https://soundcloud.com/officialsaturn) [Subtact,](https://soundcloud.com/subtact) [Grant Bowtie,](https://soundcloud.com/grantbowtie) [Jai Wolf,](https://soundcloud.com/jaiwolfmusic) [San Holo,](https://soundcloud.com/sanholobeats) [and Flume](https://soundcloud.com/flume)\n\n...I listen to a lot of music :P
1	Hip hop all the way for me.
1	My main loves are the Psychedelic/all in your head type rock stuff - Tame Impala, Led Zeppelin \n\nLove Jazz-Funk stuff like Donald Byrd, Azimuth, Herbie Hancock, Alphonse Mouzon\n\nBig disco fan too... I have more records than my father now, which is crazy.
1	I listen to almost everything. I'd have to say my two main genres are indie/alt and EDM. I also like oldies and a little rap and pop. (I love to hate pop but it's complicated.) I even enjoy listening to Spanish, French, and Korean songs. The only thing I rarely listen to is classical, unless I want to sleep (in a good way), and I can't stand screaming "music".
12	Short, rambling ENTP letter for ISFJs here	Thanks for all the presents.\n\nAlso some people might think the way you remember everything we've done together to be a bit creepy, but I find it endearing. You guys focus on your looks a lot, which I appreciate, but it's unnecessary. Be proud of yourself, you're fitting in! Don't worry so much about relationships, if you can. Enjoy your time with people and try not to think too much about the long term. :)\n\nAlright, hope I didn't come off too insulting or authoritative. Again, thanks for the presents.
5	.... I think you must be my SO responding to the conversation we had last night. So... You're welcome, boo! I love you! So sorry I'm so anxious about relationship stuff.. I try my best to keep it to myself normally :)
2	That sounds exactly like something my ENTP friend would say! Hilarious hahah. You're welcome <3
7	Hey we made an MBTI group chat and would like you to join!	Hello ISFJ's! We made a groupchat on groupme and would like you to join us!\n\nhttps://groupme.com/join_group/14593377/1y4sFa\n\nPlease give it a chance! You might enjoy it!\n\nEDIT: Downloading the app will make things a lot easier!\n\nEDIT 2: **Groupme requires my phone number/name :(!**\n\n\n\nYes, it does. However, nobody can see your phone number except for you - groupme is actually technically a texting app and can be used via text without the app, that is why. Your name can be easily changed/hidden/whatever you like. However, it's worth noting that ANY inappropriate behavior WILL get you kicked (it has happened before) and there HAVE been irl meetups stemming from this chat. Nobody is out to stalk you! We're chill.
3	Long live fastreddit. \n\n(But really guys it gets a bit crazy but there's some awesome people here!)
7	Is it common for us to be independent?	I always try my best to learn everything that I need to do in my everyday life. Even the ones that I just occasionally need to do. \n\nThis is becoming a problem at times because I see other personalities relying on other people and that is ok. Even if I'm on the other side and i'm the one being asked for help, I always do my best to help and never think that this is a burden at all unless i'm obviously being taken advantage of. \n\nPersonally though, I always think that i'm being a burden on others when I ask for help and I find myself apologizing profusely and thanking them too much as well.
8	For me, definitely.\nI have this weird fear of asking for help, because I always feel like everybody has more important things to do, and I don't want to be a burden.\n\nI also have a tendency to volunteer to do more than my fair share of work, because I want it to be done right, and I don't always trust that other people will do it correctly.\n\nIt's sort of counter-productive though, because when I'm overworked like that, I can't do things as thoroughly as I would like to.
3	I have an issue where i just don't trust people to do things how I do them. I'd rather do something myself so that i know it gets done how i want it.\n\nI also have quite a bit of social anxiety, so asking someone for help for something can get my heart racing, and i'd rather take the burden even if i know it would be alot easier with someone else. I think this is what specifically made me independent, I just can't bring myself to request help unless i really need it
1	While I ask for help when I really need it or if it's not too hard in general when doing tasks I try not to ask things that would burden people for a long period of time or get them to worry about me.\n\nI just feel bad when people start to overly think about me a mix of not wanting attention and using up too much of their time.
5	How did you find your first and/or current significant other?	I've never actually officially gotten in actual relationship before.\n\nIn elementary school, I was kinda sorta with someone (my guess she was ESXP). We were really good friends from like 3rd-7th grade and we kissed once (in 7th grade) but I was so awkward and insecure and immature and questioned if she liked me or not (my guess is she probably did). There was this awkward moment that had us not talking for a while.\n\nFrom up until I finished college, there have a been a few people I liked but was too insecure to try anything (one thing I did was confess to someone in high school but got rejected. Thankfully we stayed friends and that didn't get awkward).\n\nI'm now a 25 year old Male (turning 26 next year). Recently my social life is mostly going to local anime/cosplay gatherings and conventions (which are really fun). I've met some really cool people but haven't had any relationship progress (not sure if I'm trying too hard to find someone in this social group? I feel like it's my best bet since I'm a pretty big anime/video game nerd).\n\nI guess my problem now is just needing to actually socializing more, being less shy/more confident and just find someone I can be comfortable with and feel like it could be a good long term relationship (that's my ideal).\n\nBut enough of about me, I'm curious how fellow ISFJs have gotten with their significant other(s). This post could probably just be asked on some relationship/confidence sub or whatever but I feel like I'd be able to relate to stories/advice that fellow ISFJs would give lol.
3	First two from online gaming/forums (both lived far away, as the downside).\n\nCurrent one: Went out (a rare occasion) to play a D&D type board game with some acquaintances. While there we were drinking, and a few people walk in through the doorway. This guy says "hey! He plays league and so does gretay, you should play together!" and I thought he was super hawt so I wrote down my summoner name on a taco bell receipt and gave it to him. And then later that week he had added me on league and we joked and flirted a lot and then started hanging out in person etc etc. I think the key for me is to have some sort of online connection with a person because I feel much more comfortable online than in person (at first at least, now I'm comfortable irl with him lol). \n\nIt takes going out of your comfort zone to meet people. I learned that someone wasn't just going to walk up to me and say I was awesome and we should be friends/a couple. So I started to be more open about asking people to do things, and going out even though it can be stresaful/scary... You'll meet someone eventually!
2	My first SO was straight out of high school so I don't feel like that should count. We were together for 7.5 years, which took me all the way past college and then some. Getting into the dating scene when you're 23 is really weird and challenging. I had no idea of what to do. \n\nI knew the clubs were definitely not my thing and going out to socialize in large unfamiliar groups sounded daunting. So I opted for the interwebs. I was here on reddit and then OKCupid. Went on a lot of dates - some good, some bad. But I eventually found my my SO on Okc. \n\nHe told me that when he was dating he would always follow through with a date no matter how he felt about the other person to practice feeling comfortable conversing with strangers. Might be helpful for you too. \n\nEdit 1: OKC was a nice place to look since you can see what people's interests are and also gauge their personalities somewhat. At least that's how I felt. 
2	Most of the people I've dated have just been people I met when I happened to be in the same place they were (class, youth groups, etc). I almost always waited for them to approach me first, or for some hint to be dropped as I was too insecure to try anything on my own. There were a few times I went out of my comfort zone when I was younger, and it made me feel incredibly uncomfortable.\n\nMy current SO I met while going out for coffee with a friend. He was a friend of my friend, and they met up at the coffee shop. I complimented him, and he reciprocated. From there I tried to judge whether or not he was into me, and spent a bit of time on the phone and talking online before getting brave enough to mention the idea of dating.\n\nOne thing I found that helps with confidence is making online friends. Try to be the person you want to be online (not to a ridiculous point, but more confident and relaxed) and some of it will carry over to regular life. Also, I find that face to face interaction is the hardest, so maybe start building relationships through texting or phone calls.
1	I was in an abusive relationship and met my current boyfriend after talking to him about it for awhile until I realized how awful it was to be dating that piece of shit.  I really got to know him and we ended up together and have been for 4 years now (19F).  He ended up teaching me how to play video games because my ex told me that it would fuck up my life to play video games.  I've made so many friends through the gaming community and gaming has really strengthened our relationship.
11	Anyone else worry about people beliving you?	I constantly stress over whether someone believes me or not.\nFor instance: I have had to cancel my music lessons 2x back to back..due to sickness (my son) and my husband having a Drs appt. I am worried they might think i am irresponsible and just blowing them off. My hubby has been having pains in his body for over a week now and he was referred to a specialist ( after going to  3 Dr appts last week). I COULD have scheduled it for a later date...although the next one they had was next week. I could not wait that long. Hes been in pain daily and this is an area that needs taking care of. Also the office is an hr away. \nSo anyway I feel guilty of having to cancel my lessons again. And I worry what kind of person they think I am ..
4	I'm definitely preoccupied with being seen as genuine. Sometimes it feels like I'm lying, even when I know I'm not! I've been in your position before, feeling like I need to justify something so silly as cancelling two lessons in a row. It's like, "no really! My husband is sick and I can prove it!". \n\nOff the top of my head, I blame that on our [Extraverted Feeling](http://www.cognitiveprocesses.com/Cognitive-Functions/Extraverted-Feeling.cfm) function. 
3	I'm sure that if you explain the situation to them then they would be more than understanding. If you are overly concerned you can just tell them that you may not be able to attend all of your lessons for x amount of time due to having to care for your husband. I'm positive that they don't think you're awful or a flake, you're not the first to do something like this and you are not the last. 
3	Yes. I hate if someone doesn't believe me. I also hate if I accidentally lie to someone -- aka "all I ate today was a pb sandwich! (5mins later) Oh I lied, I also ate a banana earlier also!" \n\nIf someone doesn't believe me I get hugely frustrated, like if I say something and they're all "surrrrreeeee...." I get upset and am all "I'm not lying!" \n\nIn addition to your concern about what your music teacher will think... I get very stressed out having to change/cancel things because I feel as if I've wasted their time, as if I seem flakey, etc etc. But sometimes you've just gotta do it and you can just be extra nice next time you see them! I think our types are very sensitive to how we think others perceive us, so... yeah. 
2	You guys all nailed it right on the head!
1	I've sent my banjo teacher screenshots of internet errors (we do lessons over skype) just in case he thinks I'm just blowing him off. I also avoid calling in to work for the same reason.
4	ESTP dating an ISFJ: Please help!	I am a 23yo guy ESTP dating a 21yo ISFJ and I need some advice in regards to trying to get my girlfriend to try new things. For example: I exercise and play a lot of sports. I've tried for months to get her to exercise with me and so far no luck. She is fairly athletic and in great shape so I'm not sure what the hang-up is, and when I ask her she doesn't have an answer. Suggestions? 
5	For me it's an issue of nervousness, of feeling scared of walking into a new gym. Maybe show her information on the gym, or specifically say what equipment it has and be like "you can just go when I go and we can leave whenever you decide--there's an elliptical you could try and a variety of weights to do some arm stuff also!"\n\nHonestly I've been slacking on the gym also, does she have time for the gym? Is she already super busy? 
3	When you exercise do you go to the gym or do you do your own thing?\n\nAnd what does she do to get in shape? Perhaps she's more comfortable with the routine she has now?
3	When I make decisions about something, I rely heavily on past precedent, and at age 21 I didn't have a lot of past experience to go on. So you could try telling her about some of the sports and workout activities you do so that it's not such unfamiliar territory. Then you could tell her that you'd really enjoy doing one of those sports/activities with her, but she can pick which one and if she doesn't like a particular one, she doesn't have to do it again.\n\nAnd don't forget that while some or even many "no"s may be because it's unfamiliar, others may be because she really doesn't like some element of the activity in question (for example, I don't like competitive things.) So you could say that you want to try some new things together because you like variety, but as with the exercise example, give her a say in which things (for example, you could give her a bunch of suggestions of things you'd like to do and let her pick one) and give her time to find out some information about the new activities in advance.
3	Thanks a bunch, guys, this is really helpful!\nShe is interning this summer, but only three days per week, so time isn't the issue. \nWhen I go to the gym I usually follow a pre-made plan. She is a gymnast, so she mostly does cardio or some type of tumbling. I can't actually go to the gym she uses because I'm not a gymnast, otherwise I would just go with her. \nDo you guy think asking her to assist me in the gym would be a good idea? I was thinking about asking her if she could just come to spot me; she wouldn't even have to do the exercises. She is pre-physical therapy, so she would be able to critique my form. Good idea, or insulting?
2	Ask her to try it at least once and if she doesn't like it, she won't have to do it again. "Don't knock it till you try it!"\n\nWhat is her workout routine and can you join her? Take turns picking activities to do together... like she picks zumba and next you pick basketball.
10	Overthinking situations	Does anyone else always find your brain/emotions negatively overthinking how you would feel in a given situation (ex. Potential new job, new place to live, etc)?  Seems like I always have a tough time just letting go and embrace change or the unknown.  I just get really bad anxiety and pass on things because of this.  Not sure if this is a ISFJ trait or not.
2	Yes. All the time. You just have to go out there and do it. In fact, I'm sitting here right now on Reddit instead of potentially following up on jobs. I should really get on that.
2	Absolutely. I think of everything possible and it causes a lot of anxiety. Honestly, sometimes I need someone to ground and remind me that it will be okay and that I don't have to assume the worst case scenario. It's still something I'm learning how to handle. Change is scary and so is the unknown but I know that I have myself and that I've been through worse things in my life. I feel confident that I can handle whatever life throws at me. 
1	I have this problem too. I still struggle with this and sometimes I would think that maybe I have to struggle with this forever and it's just something that I have to get used to. It sucks but I hope that's not the case at all.\n\nAnyway, something that helps lighten up the feeling of anxiety for me is when I think that my problems and worries are petty compared to someone else's like a starving family in Africa for example. They don't have time to think of the same worries i'm having because they have more important problems to worry about. For some reason, this helps lighten my anxiety over things that haven't happened yet.
6	Post the book you're reading, along with its bookmark.	
2	Currently reading Before I Go To Sleep and the bookmark is a ticket to Jurrasic World :P
2	Reading Carrie, the bookmark is a very tiny receipt ha.
2	Reading "Heartfelt Discipline" and the bookmark is a Starbucks bookmark.
6	INTJ here - help with my ISFJ, please!	I'm an INTJ (25m), currently courting an ISFJ (26f). To date, our relationship has been picture perfect in every way - but it seems we've hit a bit of a slowdown lately. So I've come to you all seeking a little insight...\n\nAs ISFJ's, do any of you have fears that cause you to pull back early on in a relationship? As in, fears of getting too close, being hurt, etc. Any suggestions on how to handle an ISFJ that has gone in to their shell a bit? 
6	I am also an ISFJ and my husband is an INTJ. I have always had a tough time opening up to people, and it definitely hinders my husband and my communication. He is very concise when he speaks about things in our relationship, and I have to take time to think out my response. Especially if I think it's negative. Us INFJS are people pleasers and it's hard to be negative and possibly lose face in front of a person who we care about. \n\nMy husband is out right not but I'll have him give his flip side when he gets home.\n\n\nEdit: try and let her talk. She probably needs to mull her words over, so get her in a comfortable space, dim the lighting a bit and see if she'll open up. She's gonna need to feel safe and accepted.
3	We are very private people and take a while to open up to others. \n\nI am in a 1.5 year relationship with an INTJ male. I will caution you that one of the toughest aspects of our relationship is communication. It takes a lot of clarification and double-checking to be sure we are on the right page. \n\nAlso, in the beginning I kept many of my thoughts and feelings hidden. My boyfriend was very blunt and not great with tact, and I had to spell things out to him if I wanted them done. It has gotten much better now, as I've learned to express how I feel/think (altho it can take me a few mins to work up the courage, he has learned to be patient) and I just say something if I want it done instead of being upset if he doesn't read my mind.\n\nYoure both older than us (we are 22) so you might not experience these issues if you have both had past serious relationships. \n\nIf you have any specific questions, feel free to ask! I can also ask my boyfriend to write a comment if you'd like his perspective. \n\nI think this relationship is truly complementary and has really made us better people in terms of allowing us to understand vastly different points of views/perspectives (not in terms of religions/politics/whatev but just in the way that we think and understand the world). \n\nPersonalityforum also has some good posts on this relationship. We are enigmas, so expect there to be confusion. But once you get past the hardest times, it's so fulfilling.
2	Any ISFJs interested in an Enneagram+MBTI interplay subreddit?	Our team has been looking for people that are interested in MBTI/Socionics or Enneagram to be new members of our sub. Most personality subreddits focus on stereotypes, and general "fun" conversation that isn't necessarily producing value. Our subreddit has been created by a team of 6 users extremely versed in MBTI, Socinoics, and Enneagram. We plan to have a highly organized subreddit that combines ideas of Enneagram and Socionics (both are to be discussed). There aren't many communities where the interplay of Enneagram and Jungian ideas are discussed - and we wish to change that.\n\nWe are going to include weekly typing threads, that require video submissions answering a questionairre, and we have many experienced typers on the team. We hope to have a community that fosters noobies as well as those more experienced. The typical subreddits /r/mbti and other mbti subreddits focus on stereotypes, and many people are incorrectly typed, we hope to change that. \n\nOur subreddit is private as of now, but we are beginning to add people as the final design, as well as wiki work is finishing up. Let me know if you are interested. We have a severe lack of representation with ISFJs and ESFJs (which is usual for the internet) and it is important for us to have not only diversity between peoples expertise in the subject (we want interested newbies as much as we want experts) but also general diversity in types.
1	Could you give me an idea of what the content and discussions on the sub would look like? 
1	Ohhh I would love to be a part of that!! Hope I am not too late..\n\nI have no idea why but ever since I heard about MBTI/socionics/enneagram I have had an interest. And I know I am an ISFJ from the many times I have taken the MBTI test lol. Also I have been wanting to join a community of people that I can freely talk about this with, the internet seems to be the only safe place, as nobody in real life is ever interested in these theories.
1	I'm an INTP, but I'd love to join. 
5	Anybody have strong ISFJ and INFJ qualities?	I recently found out that I'm an ISFJ about a week ago.\n\nMy friend was really curious to see how I'd turn out and if she'd be correct.\nShe wasn't disappointed XD \n\nHowever, when my results were finished, I received a 1% of sensing over intuition, but to my preference, I don't feel as if I only use one of these things the majority of the time.\n\nAnybody else have a similar result?
2	[deleted]
1	I have strong qualities from both for sure.  I always say my secondary type is INFJ.
3	Can you sometimes, without meaning to, accidentally belittle or subconsciously brush off other people's acheivements because you're really uncomforitable bragging about yourself or accepting praise in general?	Cause that's how you come across.
5	Maybe... But I don't think about it enough to think about it like that. I'll compliment somebody genuinely on their achievements if it's something they are proud of. If somebody is complaining, however, I have a hard time being genuine with my sympathies. Usually I feel like people are complaining about something they have the power to change so I don't understand why they complain instead of fixing their problem. 
4	Not generally. If someone did something well I normally do tell them great job etc etc. If I see them bragging about their own accomplishments I'm more likely to downplay what they did, tho. So I don't mind heaping on the praises to other people as long as they aren't being dramatic and begging for praise/attention. 
1	Constantly and with (unintentional) enthusiasm.\n\nIf ever praised for anything even if I'm not consciously like "oh god no, don't even" I will speak negatively regarding the trait they're praising.\n\n"Wow that drawing is so beautiful, you should have an etsy shop".\n\nmy response: oh gosh, that seems like a lot of effort, and I doubt anyone would even shop there. It's quite an intimidating process.\n\nwhat my response should have been: Oh! Thank you so much! I'm always so worried some some going to think I'm egotistical :s
1	could I get a book suggestion from an ISFJ please?	Hello me and my ISFJ friend have to drive 3 hours every friday from New York to Massachussetts.  We are listening to books on tape but he seems to have different interests then me an (INFP)  I was wondering if you ISFJ's had any favorite books that we could try.  \n\nThanks! 
3	Their Finest Hour by Winston Churchill. I read it in his voice and can't stop giggling! Granted, I'm a history buff and am kinda weird...\n
2	I don't know to what extent ISFJs enjoy works written by their own; but as an INTP, I profoundly enjoyed the [Vorkosigan Saga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorkosigan_Saga); and I do know of one ISFJ for whom it is her favorite series.\n\nDon't be fooled by the sci-fi setting; these are books about *people*.
1	Spiritual fiction: Siddhartha\n\nPsychology: The Highly Sensitive Person\n\nSci Fi: Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Ender's Game\n\nThose are a few of my favorites 
1	We had a thread of book suggestions not too long ago that you could [check out here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/38hnv2/isfj_favorite_book_list_please_comment_add_yours/)
1	I really enjoyed Dragonflight by Anne McCaffrey. I've reread it multiple times and there is a whole series of books.
11	Favorite 'distractions'?	Hi guys! I spend a lot of my time online, chillin, relaxing, the whole deal. Over time I've collected a couple websites and activites for mindless distractions. They help me to unwind, in a relaxing way. They're usually something I can do in the background while hanging out with friends. These types of distractions give me a calming/mind numbing sense of peace, if that makes sense. So, here is my little collection:  \nhttp://29a.ch/sandbox/2011/neonflames/#  \nhttp://weavesilk.com/  \nhttp://thisissand.com/  \nhttp://www.apl.tv/cute.htm  \nhttp://www.wolframalpha.com/  \nhttp://www.putyouinabettermood.com/  \nhttp://thoughtcatalog.com/  \nhttp://pyx-1.pretendyoure.xyz/zy/  \nhttp://www.stumbleupon.com/home  \n  \nSeveral of these are offered in the App store for apple and android devices. As you can tell, I like to read a lot, and so anything that catches my eye, will be read. So isfj, what are your secret websites or favorite distractions? \n
10	www.reddit.com
4	I don't know about the rest of you isfjs, but I sometimes have trouble letting myself relax due to guilt that I should be doing something productive.  I've found a good compromise with [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/).  This site alone won't make me fluent in a foreign language, but it's a fun way to learn the basics or brush up on a forgotten language while sitting on the couch.
2	Anime, video games, visual novels, reddit, online browsing, facebook, etc\n\nThese are my go tos for fun/relaxation
6	Dog people or cat people?	Which do you prefer? Or if neither, which other pets make good ISFJ companions?
3	It depends really. I prefer pets that are mostly independant but will show affection when prompted. My cat Walter is a great pet :) He does his own thing and when I want to cuddle he is all for it.
3	I've been a cat person my whole life mostly because of bad run-ins with dogs, but now I'm reeeally wanting a really big brute dog for some reason. They're just so big and cuddly and wanna be friends with everyone. Still love my cat though.. So no preference, both :)
2	I love both dearly. I have a cat, which was a recent and impulsive decision. Never thought I'd actually get one but I am VERY glad I did. She's super sweet and loves cuddling with me. The other pets I have owned are sugar gliders, own two currently and they're absolutely perfect for me. They sleep all day so when they're bonded to you they can just have them sleep in your shirt, pocket or a bonding pouch around your neck. It's just really relaxing to have them with me. Plus, play time is lots of fun.
2	Owls.... Definitely owls...
1	Am cat person, but also like dawg.\n\nBut for real. I like dogs, I just personally can't own one. They're high maintenance, and I'm more into pets who can do their own thing while I feed and clean their boxes. My cat is super chill, so I'm good with him.\n\nDogs you hafta take on walks and make sure they get the right exercise. I like dogs when they belong to other people and are trained properly! Pitbulls are adorable.
1	I'm clearly a cat person. I really like dogs, but if I had to choose, I would go for a cat!
1	I'm a dog person, as I've always grown up with a dog in my house. But I do like most pets and cats are okay, I just don't know how to pick them up or treat them. 
1	I'm just an animal person in general.\n\nI currently own a dog but don't own a cat (that's changing in August, though!) I love dogs and cats in different ways. For me it's more about my connection with an animal. I just "click" with certain animals. I feel a deep connection with my dog, and had one with my previous cat before she passed away.
1	I am more of a cat person. I like dogs but there are alot about dogs I don't like. And I am also afraid of dogs. If I go over to someone's house and they have a dog, I ask "what kind, How Big" and just stay in the car...LOL Somtimes i ask if they can put it up and i hide behind my husband..haha
4	What music do you all listen to?	Inspired by the thread asking if you listen to music that fits your mood, I thought, what music do you guys even listen to? To get the ball rolling, I'll go first:\n\nI listen to a lot of EDM, specifically the Future Bass category. It is fairly hard to describe, but if you join us over at [/r/futurebass](http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebass/) you would get a better sense of the kind of music that I listen to. Currently, I'm listening to one of the [sets they posted.](https://soundcloud.com/caleb-reher/sets/big-future)\n\nI also like alternative music, like [Neutral Milk Hotel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7BqHYM-VJA)\n\n/ramble\n\nSo what music do you all like?
9	I tend to like instrumental music more often than vocal music.\n\nClassical music, video game music, anime/movie/TV BGM, techno, etc. are very appealing.\n\nVideo game Music is my usual preference. 
5	[Here's my Last FM](http://last.fm/user/hreyfa)\n\nOnly proper way I can really share my taste.
5	Pop punk,  punk,  metal,  Hard Rock,  alt rock,  pop,  k-pop,  r&b.  My favorite type of metal is power metal.  
4	A year ago: beautiful instrumental, trailer music (Two Steps From Hell, Immediate)\n\nNow: Heavy metal, screamo, rock
3	Like superange128, I go for instrumental. But I'm into a lot to be honest. My music taste is picky, and often when I find a song I like, I try to find others EXACCTTLLLYYY like it. Video game music, movie soundtracks and relaxing music.\nMy boyfriend describes my taste as meditative. Or like intuitive to how I feel. Reflects my mood.
2	I listen to a wide variety of stuff ranging from 80s trad goth to pop punk to hip hop. My SO is always saying I listen to too many kinds of music :/ idk, I'm just not picky with music :)
2	I listen to wide variety of music, but I tend to gravitate towards music with nice guitar work, being a guitarist myself.
2	Honestly I listen to a bit of everything, I don't like to get bored and I need lots of music to suit my mood and it's also nice to relate to it as well. Can't say a certain genre takes the lead but I'll give a variety of examples. 80's, punk, folk punk, metal, old school hip hop, some classic blues (patsy cline, anne murray), alternative, gothic, industrial, techno, etc. So many sub-genres too. As some others have said, I'm really not too picky and will give most music a chance.
2	Hip-hop, r&b, edm, and dream pop
2	Just about everything. FromEDM to classical to country to jazz
2	I tend to focus on certain songs I hear that I really enjoy, rather than a certain type, if that makes sense.\n\nSome of my favorites, listed with the song that made me love them.\n\n* Genesis by Grimes\n* Wild World by Cat Stevens\n* Special Place by Infected Mushroom\n* The Girl and the Robot by Royksopp\n* Violet by Hole\n* Heart Cooks Brain (and many others) by Modest Mouse [I almost never listen to them now, but a few years ago they were *all* I listened to almost... I was depressed back then I think, wish I would have gone to a therapist.]\n* Sensual Seduction by Snoop\n* Empty by the Cranberries\n* I'm God by Clam Casino\n* I Will Buy You A New Life by Everclear\n* Jumper by Third Eye Blind\n* Fashion! by Lady Gaga [basically her whole Artpop album, but I've never listened to her other albums]\n* Got You (Where I Want You) by The Flys\n* Get Low by Dillon Francis/DJ Snake [one of the first trap songs I heard, and what got me really into it. I've also started raving haha.]\n\nI'm sure there are some I'm forgetting, but these are a lot already haha.
2	Ever heard of E.S. Posthumus?
7	ISFJ's: Did you struggle finding a job.	Currently, I will be a college senior. I have moved from major to major. I feel like I don't know what I am passionate about or what my talents are. A major in undergrad I've learned is meaningless and only is successful if you make the most of it. Only yourself and more schooling can change that for a career. Anyway. I am struggling to figure out what career path or school trajectory to follow. Thoughts. I've taken many personality tests and they all say spot on I am an isfj! 
3	I was/kinda am in the same boat as you. Started as an English major, didn't take really any English classes the first year. Then switched to environmental studies as I happened to take an intro class in that and liked it. Then switched to environmental science at my INTJ mom's request/demand. And now I've graduated and am looking for jobs in the environmental science/education field. \n\nHonestly I still don't feel incredibly passionate about what I do, but I do enjoy my job to some extent. I always figured I'd be better at some random office job--low key, low stress, no decision-making... \n\nStill not completely sure where I'll end up. Good luck finding something, what is your current major? 
1	You might look into any resources your college provides as far as career exploration options. Mine offers a combo MBTI and Strong interest inventory test that helped inspire me to try to figure out what I want to do. I'm also going to be a college senior this year but it is yet to be seen if I know what I'm doing or not haha.
1	Hi iphoneanonymous,\n\nI'm an ISFJ employment counsellor who works in a liberal arts institution.  Basically, I help my students market themselves to prospective employers to get the jobs that they want!\n\nYou've obviously taken a few personality tests (otherwise, how would you know you are an ISFJ?) but have you checked out your institution's career services centre?  I would echo DolphinShades' suggestion.  \n\nHopefully, your institution can give you some one-on-one guidance in how to start. There's no quick answers to this: it's a process of self-exploration and trying things out.  Usually, career centres have assessments that do take into consideration your skills, your interests and your values to see where those intersect.  That information, combined with labour market information (knowing which jobs are in demand or are in over-supply)  would be a starting point to start looking up specific jobs that might interest you.  Then you could start researching further into those fields (meeting people who do those jobs for a living, etc).\n\nI'm also hearing that you're concerned about your skills.  I can assure you that you DO have skills.  I see liberal arts student after student in my office, and they all think that they no skills to offer an employer.  Each one walks away from our meeting with several skills that they can express on a resume.  As a starting point, I would suggest using this checklist http://www.southwestern.edu/live/files/118 to start thinking about the skills that you have to offer.  I always use this checklist as a launching-off point to talk about student skills before we begin work on resumes.\n\nThe thing with Liberal Arts degrees is that it's sold as a package.  No employer really cares what you've majored in (with a few notable exceptions, including Journalism).  They care more about the skills that you learned and the experiences that you've had.

8	Do you believe in soulmates?	I'm curious to know if I'm the minority here, because I don't. I believe love is a choice and there is a threshold that certain people will meet to "qualify" as someone you can spend your life with. I ask because my boyfriend (INFP) does believe in soulmates, but he also doesn't believe I am that person. This hurts a lot considering my own views on the matter. It feels like he has chosen not to love me...I'm sorry to burden you guys with this. I just need to get it out...I'd really like to know your views on this, if you don't mind :)
5	I don't believe in soulmates, no.\nIn my opinion, love is a choice.\nThat shallow, fleeting feeling of butterflies and fireworks in a relationship doesn't last.\nThat's not love, that's infatuation.\n\nLove, to me, is choosing to stick by somebody through the thick and thin. To love them regardless of their flaws or drawbacks.\nObviously the initial attraction and chemistry has to be there to begin with.\nBut once the honeymoon period fades, it's an active choice to love and stay faithful to a person, which for me, honestly isn't challenging at all.\n\nToo many people are expecting to have the fireworks last forever, and as soon as it starts to fade, they think they've fallen out of love.\nIt's a pretty naïve view on relationships, and a lot of them end unnecessarily because of it.
4	Yes, I do.  I married my soulmate and it was the most amazing thing ever.  He passed away after only 21 days of marriage.  I remarried after 4 years, but it is not the same.  I will miss him forever.
3	I don't believe in it either, I personally think that believing that there's just one person in the whole world who'd be perfect for you is ridiculous. It sucks that your boyfriend thinks you're not "the one", I'm sorry, I hope he changes his mind.
1	Yes, or rather I believe that there is someone in your life who you will meet who is the most compatible with you.\n\nI may already have met her - it didn't work out. Everything since has felt like settling.
1	I believe in soul mates, but I don't think they are what most people believe them to be.\n\nA soul mate (in my opinion) is someone who flows well, seeming perfectly, through mind and body.\n\nThat person you meet and instantly feel the chemistry between the two of you.\n\nThis indicates that I believe one person can have more than one soul mates in the world.\n\nLove is something that is up to you.. You can choose to love anything and anyone you want, as long as it's in the moral parameters you choose to withhold.\n\nI choose to look at love the way it's described in 2 Corinthians.\n\nLove is patient, love is kind, it does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.  It is not rude, it is not self seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.\n\nThe verses go on.\n\nNow, the honeymoon faze is a real thing XD\n\nChemical reactions can faze out... But it's up to the both partners to keep it going.\nIf you are a soul mate, that shouldn't be an issue..  But if you're in a relationship with someone who emotionally isn't fit with you, that'll be a problem.\n\nGet what I'm sayin?\n\n
4	Any tips to help with talking to a defensive ISFJ?	My mother is an ISFJ. She grew up in an abusive home, and at 62, still hasn't recovered from it. She still keeps in touch with her parents, bottling it up and acting like nothing happened. She has a temper and is prone to angry outbursts. I know she means well, and just has a lot of emotional baggage without any idea of what to do with it. I think she honestly doesn't understand that even though she didn't physically abuse my brothers and I, she passed on the psychological abuse. She also abuses my disabled father, even physically.\nI can't just pretend it never happened. I have tried to talk to her about it before, but she gets very defensive. Do you have any tips on how to talk to her without making her feel attacked?
1	Personally, when I get defensive, it's easy for me to start building a mental wall, one brick at a time.. Especially if it's for a good reason.. But unfortunately, I'm not always justified.\n\nI think the best approach you could use is easing into the topic that's most troublesome.. \n\nMyself, I find it easier to confront people by laying all my cards down on the table.. Never take an aggressive approach.  Have a silver tongue and be gentle with words.\nBe comforting but be direct.\n\nIf things start to head south, that's probably because she didn't pick up your frequency and refuses to meet in the middle.\n\nJudging by the situation, that would be pretty difficult to do.\n\nGood luck to you.  
5	What are your hobbies?	I'm curious to know what all of you guys do for fun, and/or if we have any similarities in what we enjoy doing. 😊\n\nPersonally, I feel like my hobbies are kind of lame, but I do enjoy them.\nI'm really really into photography (though I'm not exactly talented at it), I love reading, and I love watching movies.\nI also occasionally have random bouts of creativity where I'll pick up something random, like knitting or crafting. \n\nWhat about you guys?
5	Sailing, tennis, and hiking
5	Horseback riding, reading, martial arts, hiking, traveling, doing anything outdoors really! 
3	been dancing since I was 7, I'm also a swimmer and an amateur guitar player!
3	Reading, cooking and baking, fine dining, and I can talk to my wife for hours on end (when we actually get to spend time together). The last one is not exactly a hobby, but it does give me a lot of joy and satisfaction.
2	Everything relating guitars.\nWoodworking, wikipedia haha, and technology stuff.
2	Woodworking, auto repair, boxing, lacrosse, backpacking and general fitness.
7	ENFP roommate	So I've recently moved in with my INTJ boyfriend and his ENFP friend. Things are going well mostly, but I have found myself growing irritated with ENFP rm. He often talks big and exaggerates (imo) and also puts on facades and says stuff to seem cool (as far as I can gather -- he admitted he adopted his "swagger" just to seem more impressive to a certain group of ppl, stuff like that). I have known him for a while, and hung out quite a few times before moving in together... He is a good guy, no doubt about that, but I can't help but be annoyed sometimes (of course I don't show it). \n\nAny advice on how to stop being frustrated? My boyfriend says he is able to just zone out a bit and ignore the big talk etc, just let it flow by, but I am having more trouble dealing with his attention-getting antics. Am I perceiving it wrong? Maybe if I heard an ENFP perspective I'd get a different glimpse into why he acts the way he does? \n\nLike I said he's a great guy and has always been there for my boyfriend which I appreciate a lot. So no major problems, just this minor issue on my part. 
1	You should repost to /r/ENFP :)
0	He can be a good guy and be full of himself. The "swagger" might have worked a few times, so he keeps it since he doesn't know how else to get people's attention. As the sensor counter part, I know what it's like to want to be an attention whore, but a lot of people can't find the natural balance. It's really obvious and annoying because it's either understated or over the top. Just don't feed him and his crap. Try to keep the attention off him if you can. It's harder to be annoying when you're not the center of attention.
4	Isfj is WAY too attracted to me	So, I myself, am an INTP woman. And a couple months ago, I met this isfj dude. After we became friends he asked me out on a date, and I said sure why not. I didn't find a romantic spark of any kind but apparently he found several. Now, I have openly expressed my disinterest but he just keeps on trying, and I really don't get why. Its not like we have deep conversations, and literally everything I say upsets him. So, my question is what can i do to end his little infatuation with me, preferably with little hard feelings because we work together?
11	Honestly, this is a difficult situation.\nI myself have been completely infatuated with an INTP for years, and I just can't seem to get over him.\nHowever, he did have feelings for me as well for a long time, so that situation is a little different.\n\nThe problem with being an ISFJ is that once we fall for a person, it's very very hard to get rid of those feelings.\nIt obviously becomes a problem if the feelings aren't reciprocated, as in your case.\n\nHave you been direct and just told him you don't feel that way about him and it's never going to work? Because I think that's a pretty good first step.\nIf you're just sort of brushing him off and dodging the issue, he's never going to know how you really feel, and he'll have no reason to stop pursuing you.\n\nYes, it would be a hurtful thing to hear, but sometimes that's necessary for a person to move on.\nIf you've done that and it hasn't worked, you should try to minimize the contact you have with him, if not cutting it off completely, though that may be difficult if you have to work with him.\n\nAny rational, sane person isn't going to continue pursuing a person when they've been very blunt about the fact that they don't feel the same way.\n\nI would also suggest sitting him down for a talk, and just gently telling him he's making you uncomfortable, and you'd be very grateful if he could keep his behavior professional around you.\n\nAs an ISFJ, nothing would horrify me more than somebody telling me that I'm being unprofessional and socially inappropriate like that.\n\nI sincerely wish you luck. In future, I would recommend not getting involved with people you have to work with, due to the fact that it makes it impossible to just cut ties with them, though I'm sure you've learned that after this incident.
2	This isn't even a personality thing. Regardless of what MBTI type he is, he should be enough of a gentleman to understand that you're not interested, you still work together, and it shouldn't impact your professional relationship.\n\nI asked a girl out at work. When she rejected me, I just smiled and told her that we were cool, and we still are; regardless of how attractive I find her, I treat her just like every other employee, and I don't give her a thought when I walk out at the end of the day. \n\nIf the guy in question can't do that, tell him to leave you alone or you'll talk to HR/management.\n\n**TLDR: Being an idiot is not exclusive to ISFJs.**
1	Shift his attention off to another woman. He'll be over you in a jiffy!
1	I am an NT but would not tell the HR unless he forcibly makes a physical approach to kissing, for example. Even if emotionless, abrasive and thick-skinned NTs would get really embarrassed by getting called up by the HR regarding a dating problem. It is too harsh from my perspective. 
1	the people clamoring HR i think is horseshit.  the dude likes you and has feelings for you.  tell him you're not interested but that you appreciate the compliments.   if he continues making you uncomfortable.  tell him you want him to stop and don't want to go to HR but he's going to force you too if he doesn't stop.  
12	How to approach an ISFJ with romantic intent?	INTJ here. I have an interest in an ISFJ who works in my office - how do I best approach this individual?\n\nSome context: we are acquaintances/have spent time together in a group setting. I'd like to start by establishing a friendship, but have little patience for social games or feeling out his interest in me. I am your typically socially dense INTJ and have extreme difficulty interpreting body language and social cues. We are friendly when surrounded by mutual friends, but our one-on-one interactions seem painfully awkward sometimes. My first inclination is to be honest in expressing my interest, but not sure how well my bluntness would be received. \n\nTl;dr How do I ask one of you out without scaring you awayyyyyy\n\nAlso relevant would be any experiences you ISFJs may have with dating an INTJ. 
12	ISFJ here.\nHonestly, I appreciate it when people are straightforward and blunt about their intentions, because it takes away the frustration of over-analyzing everything and second guessing myself.\n\nHowever, I would caution you to not come on too strong, too soon. \nWe're very very private people, and we open up to people slowly, on our own time. If people are too forceful or nosy about getting to know me, it makes me  uncomfortable.\n\nStart by just asking him out for something casual, like maybe going for coffee or something, and see what happens.\nKeep the conversation fairly casual for a little while, and don't ask too many really personal questions, if you can help it.\n\nIt also helps if you know some things about him already, or if you could try to notice some little details.\nFor example, do you know what any of his hobbies are, or what kinds of food he likes?\nI always feel super flattered when people notice little things like that about me. So for example, if you know he's really into hiking, maybe ask him if he wants to go hiking with you sometime?\n\nMost important advice I can give you is just try to be gentle/kind, especially in the beginning. Nothing scares me away faster than meeting somebody and having them challenge all of my opinions or try to debate me as soon as they start getting to know me.\n\nI love thinkers, but sometimes they intimidate me.\n\nI sincerely wish you luck! :)
2	I'm an ISFJ and my mother is an INTJ, like you. We can interact really well most of the time. But I am always in a supportive role, like subordinate. It works partly because she's my mother. She's older, wiser, and generally guiding me in life. But that could be tricky with a romantic relationship. \nI agree with what the others said. Be so careful that it's not too much too fast. I can clam up for months if people are too forward. Be clear, but not demanding. And be gentle. Pay attention to details about him. Even keep a little log if you have to. Remembering details would make me light up. 
2	ISFJ girl with INTJ guy here. We've been together about 1.5 years. \n\nFirst, be honest but not mean. My boyfriend has had to develop some tact when talking to each other, and I have had to work on discussing my feelings openly and honestly. We still struggle to communicate at times--it's honestly like we are on different wavelengths because I will say one thing, he'll interpret it a different way then I meant, we'll continue the conversation, then weeks later realize that we both thought the other meant something completely different. It's so weird, I can't remember experiencing this type of miscommunication in any other relationship. But luckily we've gotten better about clarifying things and the mistakes are usually really random and unimportant.\n\nIt does take time for me to open up to others. I took a *long* time to become open around my boyfriend and I was always confused about where we stood in our relationship as we never really said "we are boyfriend/girlfriend" until months after we started hanging out (aka: having sex).\n\nHonestly at this point I feel as though he is the perfect type for me. We enjoy just hanging out together and redditing/video games so each have our own space but we are with each other. We also go out and hike a lot, and sometimes will just have a few people over to drink and play some just dance. He helps me do things I find difficult, and I help him empathize with others. We just truly care about each other a lot, and even if we break up I cannot see it ever being less than amicable as we just... are never mean to each other when we do disagree or are frustrated with each other.\n\nIt takes time and can be a bit of a struggle in the beginning (me not opening up soon enough and him being kind of oblivious and this is his first relationship), but we have managed to make it work so far and it has been a very good relationship.\n\nThis comment is kind of rambly but if you have a specific question, feel free to ask
5	Does your occupation/avocation fit with your ISFJ personality?	I was reading an older thread in this sub in which the OP spoke about pursuing medicine as a career only to realize it wasn't a good fit for his personality. Is anyone else in a similar predicament? I've recently been pushed into a supervisory position, and I'm hating every minute of it. I've always been happiest being second-in-command, smoothing ruffled feathers, making sure all the background crap gets done, trying to make my superior and the rest of my crew as happy and stress-free as possible. Now I have to try to be a disciplinarian (I've already had to fire 2 employees). I'm failing to delegate tasks because I always tried to do the scut-work myself, and I continue to do so even though I'm letting other aspects of the job slip. I'm trying not to let anyone down because, well, ISFJ. This unwanted promotion is ostensibly meant to be a sign of faith in my abilities, but now I do more work that I dislike for the same pay, so I'm just feeling punished.\n\nHowever, since my "promotion", I've found that I'm cooking and baking a lot more to relieve my stress. Following an orderly recipe, preparing my mise en place, and (hopefully) delighting friends and family with the results is bringing me the gratification I no longer get from my occupation.\n\nSo, fellow ISFJ's, are there others like me trying to compensate for an unfulfilling job with soul-satisfying hobbies? Or have you got the world on a string, working your ideal job and pursuing your favorite outside interests?
7	I work a corporate retail which I absolutely hate. More often than not I feel like my hard work is unappreciated which makes me feel awful. I always want to feel like I am an asset or at least bring some kind of value to my workplace but unfortunately in corporate retail you're only a number.  Quitting would be the obvious solution but for some reason I feel obligated to stay (why must we be so damn loyal). I'm going back to school to hopefully fulfill my dream of becoming a veterinary assistant. 
6	I'm a nurse, so yes it fits me. I didn't learn about personality types till a few months ago, it just kind of worked out. :)
3	In my first half of high school I was set on becoming an accountant, and I was pretty good at it.  But that changed when I took a digital electronics class and discovered my passion for computer programming.  I've been a software developer for the past 15 years.  I'm not too sure if this profession is common among ISFJ's but I love the creative and the problems solving aspects behind it.  The people I work with are like my family and the software I develop is used in both the health care and education fields.
4	I graduated college with a business degree because, well, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I still think I would really like to work for a non-profit someday in some capacity, but I'm not sure exactly what capacity...\n\nCurrently, I'm in a bit of a unique position. I'm a "Management Trainee" within my company, which is quite large(40,000 associates world wide), and I "rotate" positions. I've held two so far, and I'm going to be starting a 3rd soon:\n\n1. My first "rotation" was in sales. Saying I hated it would be an understatement. I worked the job 7 months, and learned that sales is forever going to be at the very bottom of my employment preferences. I hate feeling like I am a nuisance to people, and that is exactly what I felt like everyday working in sales.\n\n2. My second position, and the one I am currently working in, is administrative in nature. Typical office work, with some client facing responsibilities. I've worked in this position for about 6 months, and I like it MUCH better than sales. I have responsiblities in this position which other people don't know how to fulfill, so I really feel like I am an asset and people need me. It is nice for everyone to feel needed, but I think as an ISFJ it is particularly important.\n\n3. The third position, which I am going to be working in soon, will be as an IT project manager. Although I haven't actually starting working as one, the research I've done on the field makes it sound appealing. It is structurred, and requires strong organizational skills, which I believe I (as well as most ISFJs) have. Not only do I have strong organizational skills, but I really enjoy organizing and creating order. I'm hoping this will be something which works for me as an ISFJ, but I won't know until I try it!\n\n\nFinally, as far as hobbies go. I really don't have any "soul-satisfying" hobbies, sadly. I've never really come across any that appeal to me in that sense. I like gaming, and watching movies/tv shows, but these are more to pass to the time, as opposed to something which really feels satisfying and meaningful. I'm big into fitness, which is more of a lifestyle than a hobby to me, and while it has without a doubt improved my life, it just isn't that "soul-satisfying" thing. I really spend most of my time working, rather than pursuing hobbies. I think I do this because I feel like my work gives me purpose, and is something people appreciate. I have a feeling this may hurt me in the long run, and it already has socially, but I just can't find a hobby which really fulfills me quite as much as working does. Only time will tell, and I'm fortunate to be young with lots of time left! Sorry for the novel...
3	I'm sure there's something else that would be a better fit, but I'm working in retail which is the only kind of job I've had. I work in a pretty niche shop now and its so much better than being a cashier drone or a coffee drone, haha. I'd say I enjoy it.
2	[deleted]
2	I get really bothered when people assume that everybody wants to do, or will be good at, supervisory jobs. Being a supervisor is a set of tasks all of its own, and just because someone likes or is good at their previous position doesn't mean the same will be true of management. I had a manager at McDonalds who tried to talk me into being a manager. She made no secret of the fact that she was pleased with my work and it was clear that she wanted to acknowledge my progress and see me grow even more, but she didn't understand that the reasons why I liked and was good at my existing position (head hostess for the kids' parties) would not have translated to management at all. (I share your love of being a 2IC, though!) Thankfully she at least accepted "no" graciously - the fact that you got forced into it really pisses me off. \n\nAs for my current job, translation, it fits my personality in many ways. I was first drawn to it because a professor said that being introverted would be an asset instead of something I would constantly need to suppress. Then when I tried it, I discovered that it really spoke to my dominant Si in terms of how important details are, and my J in terms of the organisation involved. I also notice that I do particularly well with humanities-related texts, which has to do with my Fe maybe?\n\nBefore that, I definitely compensated with hobbies. I did fan translations while I was still studying to be a translator, and I used to bring my translations to my day job and work on them during my lunch break, then go home and type them up. Even though I couldn't translate nearly as easily as I can now, it was still relaxing to take some alone time and do something that fit with who I am. \n\nI really hope you can find a better job soon. 
11	ISFJs and INFPs	are any of you in relationships/were in relationships with INFPs? from what i've seen online, ISFJs tend to be some of the rarer people who seem to really like INFPs (not all of you obviously, but enough that it's piqued my interest). and just today i've heard of two happy INFP-ISFJ relationships!\n\ni'm also just generally interested in how MBTI relates to compatibility, so feel free to share any interactions you've had with this type :)\n\nif you know you and/or your partner's enneagram, please share that as well
5	My best friend is an INFP.\nWe definitely have a really strong connection, somehow.\nI don't know if we would be compatible romantically, but we definitely get along really well as friends.\nHe's very sensitive, and he's always extremely supportive and kind whenever I'm going through anything. 
3	[deleted]
3	I'm an INfP 9w1 that had an ISFJ girlfriend for a little more than a year. You should note that I've fairly balanced F-T functions (53-47%), ergo the small F. I don't know how that affects me.\n\nShe's really cute and caring.\nUnfortunately it wasn't really a good match as our love languages differed to much. Gifts and actions don't matter to me, as an INfP I just crave a deep mental connection that I couldn't get with her. She actually said that it was evil of me to not want gifts because she likes to give gifts. Probably a descendant of Santa Claus.\n\nTo illustrate the difference: She's a loyal dog. I'm more of an individualistic cat. \nWhich matches what I read another place by a fellow INFP: too superficial, caring, materialistic, clingy and leave no space.\n\nIn general I don't think it's a good match, your best qualities aren't appreciated by (most?) INFPs :-/
2	My boyfriend is an INFP. My ex before him was an INFP as well, the one prior was an ENFP. I find myself being friends with a lot of INFP people these days but dating them also tends to be a trend. \nAnyways, I definitely found myself drawn to him when I first met him. Kind of difficult to get to know, natural INFP thing. But once I started to get to know him more as a person as well as a lover I felt really at home almost. We connect on many, many levels but I find that we have the same thought a lot. We'll be sitting and he'll suggest we do something I was just thinking of. We're drawn to the same things, we'll point something out that the other was already looking at and etc. \nI feel like I expect him to know my feelings and know that I really like him and when I don't do or say things to make it clear he feels neglected. I also have a hard time putting my feelings and thoughts into words for him so he's often left out in the cold about what's on my mind.\nINFP's are just really amazing.. I feel a connection with them naturally and always enjoy my time with them.
2	Another INFP E9 happily married to an ISFJ! We get along rather peacefully. He is sensitive to my feelings and is a loving man. I don't know his Enneagram officially (because he isn't a fan of personality tests), but he's probably a 469 tritype. \nOur main disagreements are Fi/Fe misunderstandings, and my preference for new when he prefers the tried and true. Also, if I get in a Te mood, it can be quite harsh.
1	I'm not sure about INFP but I recently connected with someone who is an INFJ.. And the communication is practically flawless.\nTo be honest, I've not felt a connection with anybody else.\n\nIs there really much of a difference between the two?
18	What do all you ISFJs look like?	I know we're all a bunch of private, modest, shy people who would rather put the focus on somebody else.\nBut let's face it.\n\nWe all probably put in a fair bit of effort on our appearances, so why not take a moment to showcase that?\n\nI'm also curious to see what we all have in common when it comes to appearances.\n\nYou guys go first.\nI'll share when all the focus is off of me. 😄
19	Well, since everybody is leaving me hanging, I'll bite the bullet and go first.\nI have a perpetual baby-face and look much younger than I am.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/VS5vk\n\nThere, that's me.\nNow somebody else jump in here and share before I feel awkward.

2	http://imgur.com/RjQEkLD\n\nI'll still hide! :p
-5	Don't really want to upload a picture, but think of a hot, athletic built emo guy 😏
6	What gets under your skin? And how do you keep yourself from not going crazy?	
10	Noises. So many. Eating, tapping, chewing, clicking, anything repetitive, any mushy/wet noises especially mouth noises. Breathing. Sniffling. \n\nEarplugs or earbuds w/ music playing or just loud music. White noise, like a fan, if I can. Or I leave the situation/area. \n\nIt's way worse when I'm irritable or socially exhausted. I try to prevent those as best as I can, like recognizing my need to rest or be alone. 
7	Lies, big or small. Manipulative behavior. Complaining. Narcissism. Loud, obnoxious behavior.
6	Manipulative people get to me, or hinting at things instead of asking straight up come to mind first. I really can't stand when people complain about things, like a back problem that they refuse to get checked out. "My back hurts so much today" "You should get it looked at then" "Yeeeeah, I dunno.. It just really hurts" It gets old for me and I don't want to hear it. 
4	Messiness. Clutter drives me insane. I'm in college and my busy schedule causes my room to get really messy during the week...Fridays are really relaxing for me because I am able to tidy up. Obviously, I lead an exciting life. /s\n\nTardiness. People who don't demonstrate respect for others. Excessive loudness. Too much physical contact from people who aren't close to me. The classic #humblebrag or just narcissism in general. People who don't keep to their word or who lack loyalty.
2	I can't stand when people act a different way around certain people.\nI dont like whining...nasty attitudes and people who don't show appreciation. \n\nI don't like loud sudden noises...like someone coming home and tossing their keys on the table....it makes me feel mad for some reason.\n\nAnd I can't stand for someone to treat me different when certain people are around. 
4	What are your biggest flaws?	
9	Moving on from bad relationships
9	My laziness, lack of determination to see something through combined with the low standards I set for myself ensure I'll never be good at anything.\n\nMy selfishness and constant desire to be alone killed off whatever social life I had and ensure I'll die alone, with no people at my funeral.
8	I'm really bad at not voicing my opinion, and being extremely shy in social situations where I don't know anyone. Also poor confidence
4	If I don't know how to respond to a difficult situation I just shut off because I'd do whatever I can to avoid conflict.
3	Sometimes I get into a slump and fall off schedule and don't stick to my plans. \nI get offended and angry easy. I take things personal a lot.\nI have a bitter attitude instead  of dealing with emotions well.
3	Low self confidence. I don't handle criticism well. I have a tendency to shut people out emotionally and put up a front for how I would like to be seen rather than how I am. I also have a tendency to hold people to absurdly high standards and then get upset when they fall short. I guess most of the flaws I see in myself are manifestations of perfectionism.
3	Not being able to make decisions on the spot when someone else is around. Especially when that person happens to be my crush.
1	I've made avoiding confrontation or any kind of drama a science. I shut down in conflict and can't process quickly. Also, I would say that I am probably a bit too trusting at times.
5	What does an immature ISFJ look like? And how can they improve?	
1	Not having any control over their emotions. Learning to control their emotions and use their feelings to their advantage instead (e.g. empathizing, avoiding depression or anxiety, focusing on a task and not letting stress overwhelm).
4	I knew one ISFJ who was always very competitive and tried to make me feel jealous of her a lot. My question is, do you tend to compete with people or is that just the way people perceive you? I think I've gotten the wrong impression and I'd like to know, in your words, what you're all about.	
6	I can relate to the reasoning behind this, based on events from my childhood. Maybe lots of isfj people take on the role of "sidekicks" in early friendships. I feel like this makes us feel the need to rise above per se in the future. Being a sidekick is not fun, you're always being one upped and talked over. Kids are mean. Logically speaking, one would reverse the roles in order to avoid that. Maybe I'm just talking from a too personal perspective but maybe other ISFJs can relate to this too.  \nBut aside from that I can't really think of any ISFJ that is anywhere similar to this person. I try to be kind to anyone I know, being any other way makes me feel like I'm being a poo head. 
3	an ISFJ girl i knew in HS was SUPER competitive with other (attractive) women. she always thought that other women were jealous of her and whatnot
2	In some instances I try to come on top but I don't actively compete in everything, and I *definitely* don't try to make others feel envious towards me. I much more prefer to all work together to a goal or win. Honestly I think the vast majority of ISFJ's you will meet will not be very competitive. She may have had low self esteem or grew up in a very competitive household. One's upbringing has a huge impact on how they perceive the world, sometimes even more so than your innate functions.
2	I am competitive. But for me it seems to be more of an internal thing, like I'm competing with others but I don't want them to know it. Whenever I get the feeling that I'm making someone feel bad, I end up feeling really guilty about it. The best example of this is something like grades or a job. I want to be competitive with others if I feel like I'm not measuring up, but not in such a way that they feel belittled. I don't know if I am making any sense with this.
9	ISFJ Favorite Book List! (please comment & add yours!!)	(self-explanatory - top-level comment with your favorite book(s) esp if you think other ISFJs would enjoy!  happy reading everyone :D)
5	Braindump time!\n\n* **The Little Prince** by Antoine Saint-Exupery\n\n* **God-Shaped Hole** by Tiffanie DeBartolo\n\n* **Winnie the Pooh** by A A Milne\n\n* **The Tao of Pooh** (& **The Te of Piglet**) by Benjamin Hoff\n\n* **The Giving Tree** by Shel Silverstein\n\n* **The Outsiders** by S E Hinton\n\n* **Speak** by Laurie Halse Anderson\n\n* **Burned** by Ellen Hopkins\n\n* **The Grapes of Wrath** by John Steinbeck\n\n* **Death of a Salesman** by Arthur Miller (this is technically a play, but whatever...)
2	**Hitchhiker's** **Guide** **to** **the** **Galaxy** (Douglas Adams) - I actually like this book a lot. It's very tangential and erratic, but that is what adds to the character to the book. It was a very enjoyable (and fast - I finished in a day) read, and I highly recommend it.\n\n**A** **song** **of** **Ice** **and** **Fire** (George R. R. Martin) - I know. BUT it is a hugely engrossing read, some of the best story lines I have ever seen. The plots are so twisty and turny you never know what happens next, I loved it. I could never go back to YA fiction after finishing the five books. \n\n**The** **Roar** (Emma Clayton) - Speaking of YA fiction, this book was surprisingly good. It takes place in the future where humanity lives in the northern third of the world. Very big themes about class conflict and exploitation of mutation. I immensely enjoyed this novel.\n\n**Congo** (Michael Crichton) - A journey deep into the heart of Africa that only gets more and more interesting. I love Michael Crichton, and have read a large number of his books. The writing is fantastic.\n\n**Next** (Michael Crichton) - Another book that I recommend by MC, this one follows a several people who are tied together by their relation to a man with a special immune system (I may be wrong but I haven't read it in a while). Very big discussion on genetics and the increasing focus businesses are giving them. Great novel.\n\n**Endar's** **Game** (Orson Scott Card) - The book follows a boy called Endar (:P) as he slowly rises to the top of a space cadet school while facing serveral issues along the way. Very interesting.\n\nAnd last but not least...\n\n**SAT** **Prep** **Guide** **2015** (Kaplan) - Oh. My. God. Cannot recommend this book enough. With such helpful advice like feeding your ego until you get the answer (Literally it says if you ever get stuck or nervous, just remember how well you prepared using the Kaplan^^TM SAT Premier Review), how can I ever give this epic novel anything but a shining A++? I couldn't put the book down. Seriously guys, check it out.
3	The Book Thief by Markus Zusak. His writing is so vivid.
2	My favorite book which I frequently recommend to people is Cloud Atlas. It encapsulates so much about humanity in a rich tapestry of environments, narratives, and prose styles. And although it has some low points, it makes you realize that they are beautiful in their own way, and necessary for the book to convey its ultimately uplifting message. 
2	Five People You Meet In Heaven and Intensity :3
2	Favorites and recent reads so I share a variety:\n\nCarrie and Pet Sematary - Stephen King.\nThe Trial - Franz Kafka.\nTropic of Cancer - Henry Miller.\nAlice in Wonderland and Through the looking Glass - Lewis Caroll.\nLolita - Vladimir Nabokov.\nAnything by V.C Andrews because I'm a suck for that sad drama and messed up family life thing.
1	One of my personal favorites is actually a book I had to read back in highschool called *The Good Earth.* It's a story that explores the lives and family dynamics of a Chinese working class family through two to three generations.
1	sense and sensibility- jane austen\nthe importance of being earnest- oscar wilde\ngreat expectations- charles dickens\n
1	**The Storyteller by Jodi Picoult**\n\nI know it's not everybody's type of book.\nBut I enjoy it tremendously.\nIt has a little bit of World War II stuff happening in there, which is a huge interest to me, but it also has enough of a story and character development to keep me interested.\n\nIt's realistic, well-researched and quite depressing, which appeals to my morbid side.\n\nThere's also a love story involved, which appeals to my sappy side that doesn't feel fulfilled unless there's a happy ending.
12	My Mom (ISFJ) is suicidal and she's looking to me for support. I don't know what to do.	I've been trying to provide support for her since her sister was murdered. My mother doesn't think that she has much going for her, because she is divorced, she doesn't have a job and her last abusive boyfriend just committed suicide. She can't catch a break and unfortunately I'm running out of positive things to say to her to motivate her.\n\nWhat would you want to hear? What can I say/do to help an ISFJ in need?
28	OP, your mother *needs* to see a therapist.  Unless you have some sort of graduate degree in psychology, you are not equipped to help someone who is suicidal.  You can be there for her, love her, try to get her up and out of the house, but she desperately needs professional help.\n\nI commend you for being your mother's support, but helping a suicidal person is a massive undertaking if you are not professionally trained to handle situations like these.
8	You can definitely provide support for her but I feel like she's been through a lot of traumatizing things that may be better discussed in therapy. Might be good to try and suggest therapy of some sort, just talking to a professional might help. It's hard to say what I wanted to hear when things were really bad for me, I didn't exactly want to hear that it was going to get better but I did want to know that I was loved and cared about. What does she enjoy doing? Find time to be with her and do something you both enjoy perhaps, just letting her know that she's not alone can be a real help.
1	ENTP here. We usually make decent therapists. Speaking of, your mom needs to see one stat. You may need to call a hospital and put her on a 72 hour suicide watch/psych hold. Her sister was murdered. That was an awful, horrific thing that happened to her and no one is trying to lessen the pain or diminish it or ask her to move on before she's ready, but if she does this, that murderer and that awful man who terrorized her for years? They'll win. Not having a man in her life doesn't make her life meaningless. She has children, she has a vast existence in front of her. She can do anything. I think you guys should pack up and move and restart somewhere else. Get away from the awful memories of that place, at least for a while. I'm not saying never come back, but maybe give yourselves a few years away from that place to heal. Taking yourself out of the equation through death doesn't stop the source of the pain, it just ensures that what caused it will take the one last thing it has to take from you: closure. Cutting it off doesn't improve upon your life. The only way to be at peace with yourself is to work through it. Her sister would want that. I know when I was going through a really awful time The Perks of Being A Wallflower helped me. Antidepressants helped my brother. We accept the love we think we deserve. Just try to remind her she deserves so much better and do what you can to help. “At times the world may seem an unfriendly and sinister place, but believe that there is much more good in it than bad. All you have to do is look hard enough. and what might seem to be a series of unfortunate events may in fact be the first steps of a journey.” -Lemony Snickett.

3	How easy is it for you to tell if someone has a Sensing or Intuition preference?	I am very interested in applying the myers-briggs in real life situations, which means I often have to "type" people. So I am interested in how easy it is for ISFJs in particular to tell the difference in other people they meet. 
3	To my understanding, each of the four traits is on a spectrum, so how easily I can tell their preference depends on how strongly they express it. :) Some people are easier to read than others. However, since ISFJs can be pretty observant and detail-oriented (I know I am), it is something I like to pay attention to.
1	INFP here -- I can usually tell if someone "lives in the present" or is more "forward-thinking". For INxx, we have our own "rich inner world" and tend to live in our own minds a lot; if someone else is an introvert (quiet, reserved; needs "recovery" time after a social interaction), and lacks this "rich inner world" (I have one, I can tell), then I can determine that they are Sensing.        \nFor Extroverts, look for if they are "living in the moment" or if they are constantly talking about thing that they want to do and stuff that hasn't happened yet. The ENxx people I know talk about things they want to do later, or things they could do. ESxx people, especially ESxP people, tend to "live in the moment" and have "a lot of energy" - depending on who you are, they are exciting or overwhelming.     \nI hope that helped!!   :)
1	I would recommend researching Cognitive Functions - It's a very accurate way of typing once you get the hang of it. Here's a quick summary of difference in functions to look for between S and N:\n\nSe: Lives in the moment; totally aware of their environment\n\nSi: Nostalgic; compares the present to the past; traditional\n\nNe: Can predict all possible outcomes of a situation; visionary\n\nNi: Knows things intuitively without evidence; has big ideas
6	Your thoughts on ENTPs	I am an ENTP who decided to check out your sub to see whether opposites really do attract. So far, I think the old adage stands up fairly well. But, it might just be me. So, how do you ISFJs feel about *your* duals?
3	I'm an ISFJ who has been with an ENTP for 16 years, married to him for a week shy of 13 years. I'd say I'm pretty fond of them. I find we work well together and compliment each other's strengths and weaknesses. 
2	I have an ENTP friend who I greatly admire. He is so charismatic and likable and wants to go into politics. It's funny how much he gets bored doing repetitive work. He does well in the spotlight. I'm fine being in the background for the most part!
1	I'm ISFJ and my boyfriend is ESTP (I know not quite the same). 16personalities.com actually tell us in both our personalities that someone like the other is a really good fit. And we ourselves think we are a terrific fit. \n\nTaking a look at ENTP profile, I can tell you that constantly playing the devil's advocate will really push away an ISFJ. We need to feel like we are being heard and would rather have a discussion with you based on your beliefs, not just what you can think of. However, if it's a true debate and you think your ISFJ is open to strengthening their view or considering another, then go for it. A couple more weaknesses of ENTP is being insensitive and intolerant, which will cause a lot of tension with an ISFJ. Empathy is a huge point for ISFJs and we tend to leave behind selfish people who can't see something from someone else's point of view. If you have a good control, or can work on, those aspects of your personality, you'll get much farther with an ISFJ. While they can try their best to be understanding of your argumentative nature, and you better believe they will listen and try to be empathetic, they will 100% ask the same of you. Don't ask them to have thick skin, but do try to be sensitive and remind them that you are trying. 
1	Best friend is an ENTP!  I greatly enjoy his sense of humor, and we have never once run out of things to talk about :)
1	I'm an ISFJ.\nMy older brother is an ENTP.\nHonestly, I really love him, and he makes me laugh like nobody else.\n\nHe brings me out of my shell, and he's very good at poking fun at me, and pointing out traits nobody notices that I'd prefer to keep hidden. He does it all in a humorous way, of course.\n\nHe also knows when to be more sensitive and compassionate, and I've never felt like he takes a joke too far.\n\n\nHowever, growing up, we clashed a lot, and our personalities were like oil and water. We get along better nowadays, but I still can't spend too much time in close proximity with him before we start to argue.\n\nThis is a sibling relationship though, so I would imagine it varies a lot in a romantic relationship. Personally, I don't think I could ever date one, just because of my experience growing up with him and seeing all the ways that we differ.\n\nI also find that they have such strong personalities, I feel a little bowled-over by them, and it can be exhausting trying to hold my ground all the time, because they do enjoy debate, and I'm not one to enjoy conflict very much.\nI do love me an INTP, though. 
6	ISFJ Snapchat?	I figured this could be a fun way just to see the world through an ISFJ's snapchats... or something like that, lol.\n\nI like to see snapchats, especially of just random things but I don't have many snapchat friends. Maybe this post can help facilitate some new bridges being made. I got this idea because I recently added a redditor so I could see her cute ferret snapchats!\n\nWe could each comment what we normally send on snapchat, and if others are interested in adding someone just send them a message. I don't feel comfortable straight-up posting my snapchat name on here, so asking for it via private message works better for me!\n\nIf you add me, you can expect snapchats related to: hiking, my stuffed seal pup Plumpkin, flowers, coffee cups, 420, funny magazine covers I see, California sunny days, League of Legends, my boyfriend's silly faces, Just Dance...\n\nIf you're interested, send me a message!\n\nLooking forward to the comments, I'm happy to expand my friends list :p
3	I have sugar gliders so if you like ferrets I think you'll like them heh. I'll send ya a message now, great idea!
2	For me you might see a picture or two of me doing random things around Western New York, some cat pictures, a hedgehog picture now and then (not mine) and concerts this summer. \n\n*edit: PM me if you want my snap!
2	I'm up for this!
1	Miss_Emma is mine! 
1	I never thought I'd actually use snapchat seriously, so when I got it I took this really embarrassing username... Add bieber_swaggins if you want to!
1	Mines Stratajim if anyone wants to add me although my name isn't Jim. I usually share snaps of road trips, outdoorsy stuff, humorous things I find around town, graffiti from around Austin, pictures of my adorable little cat, and a diy flame thrower has shown up more than once.
1	Oo interesting idea.  \nI mainly take pics of things around Reykjavík Iceland where i live and some cat pics :)  \nMy snap is doddip
1	I'd love to get in on this - have a few snapchat friends but none that share things often enough! And I bet we'd all be on the same page eh? Username is same as my reddit name, add me! I love random things and take a bunch of cool photos, so I'd reply ^_^
14	A quote that resonated with me...	"You try and act so tough, you think you’re so damn hopeless and godless and faithless, but you don’t fool me. People without hope aren’t tormented by the world the way you are. People without hope don’t give a shit. But I see it in you, in the way you look at things, even in the way you look at me sometimes, like I’m the coolest fucking guy in the universe, and I know it’s in there. Reverence. Belief. Something. You have a lot more faith than you own up to. You just don’t want to be let down."\n— Tiffanie DeBartolo, God-Shaped Hole.\n\nJust something I wanted to share with ya'll.
1	This is one of my favorite books of all time!!  (I don't actually have anything to add but I got excited when I saw this lol)
10	Any ISFJs with tempers?	Just wondering how does temper/rage fit into this type? I usually won't back down from an argument with someone close but with friends/acquaintances and strangers i will. At home I can get very frustrated and loose my temper easy. Most of the angry outbursts stem from feeling unloved..wanted..or appreciated.\n\nEdit: oh and I am very impatient
13	 I get frustrated very easily... But i can probably count the amount of times I've yelled at someone. That's not my style at all. \n\nI oftentimes get frustrated at whst others do (cheating of tests, being rude to service people) and I can rant for ages about it to my boyfriend... But I hardly go up to the actual people about it.\n\nOne time I saw someone being a dick to cashier and I went up to them, said "That is extremely rude" and walked away. \n\nWhen I was breaking up with my abusive ex, I am pretty sure I yelled at him. Or more just screamed out of emotional panic or something.\n\nWhen I found out my dad wrote an article talking shit about my mom and it was published in our local newspaper, I called him up and said "as soon as you can be as mature as me, your daughter, stay out of my life." haven't heard from him since (5 years ago). \n\nWhile I admit I get frustrated and angry easily, I often do not take it out on the object/person that caused the anger. But I will boil over about it later on my own or to others.\n\nI do not get angry from being ubloved/unwanted/unappreciated usually. I mostly get sad in those cases. Sometimes I do get angry at the world I guess, and will he all "I don't need anyone else anyways!" But that happens a lot less frequently now than it used to. \n\nAs for arguments, I normally do not feel angry during them. Honestly I try to avoid arguments. They make me frustrated at myself more than angry, because I'm not good with speaking and get emotional too easily so I'm less convincing. But I agree, with someone I know we'll I'm comfortable enough to keep talking. If I disagree with someone I don't know well, I might not say anything at all or just think in my head about how wrong they are (imo). 
4	I have anger management issues, enough said.
5	I can get angry on behalf of others but that's about it
5	I get stressed and angry very easily, but it's internalized. I rarely ever lash out at people.
2	The only time I was ever truly angry was when I was on birth control.. Never was I an angry or sharp person like that until I was taking it for a couple months. I full on yelled at my boyfriend at the time for laughing at me when I was trying to talk about something I felt to be really serious. I don't yell.. So I'm off birth control and am back to normal. I think this is a variance in ISFJ's because my ISFJ friend does exactly what's been described by gretay. If I'm angry about something it's because a person was awful to someone I love and I want to beat their face in a little but never would so i just imagine it in my head or think about what I'd say to tell them off.
2	I have always had anger problems starting from childhood. Prob due to being abandoned several times by my mother. And NOT trusting those close to me that they love me. If that makes sense.  
2	Yes I get angry very easily. Only once or twice have I had to restrain myself physically and for good reason, like someone already hitting me or something. I only let myself get visibly angry around people I am close to, which is bad. :/ I get carried away easily when I'm arguing with someone and most of the time we're arguing about something completely different than when we started. I bottle it up though, so when it comes out everything comes out. I'm working on it, clashing with anyone at all ruins my day and I feel guilty for days after. :/ 
2	I get a temper at times when i'm stressed, esp. if i'm working with others who aren't cooperating or helping out. 
2	Anger is the negative side of the Feeling. The positive side is kindness and compassion, but the negative is anger and cruelty. 
1	It really takes a lot before I become visibly angry. Unless someone is doing something exceptionally annoying or harming another person, I just can't get worked up over it.\n\nExcept once in a while, and this is the one that scares me, once in a while something that would otherwise not bother me triggers a cataclysmic release of blind rage. This only happens once every several years, like all the anger I should have been expressing in little bursts has been building and building, then gets released all at once. Though I'm not really sure if that is the case. I don't believe I hold on to anger like that. Maybe I'm wrong and it's some kind of subconscious thing.\n\nSo I guess I kind of have a temper. About once a decade. All at one time.
1	I don't/can't feel anger very easily. It just doesn't come to me. I'm much more prone to feel sad or disappointed. Anger just isn't a comfortable emotion for me, and I'm not even capable of really raising my voice and I don't recall ever having raised my voice. If others get angry, I almost always nope myself out of that situation. 
30	I deserve...	I deserve the same kindness I give to others. \n\nI deserve to forgive myself as easily as I forgive others. \n\nI should not judge myself harshly when I do not judge others at all. \n\nI deserve to worry less about the future and focus more on the present. \n\nI should give the same patience to myself as I give to others. \n\nI deserve to treat myself as well as I treat anyone else... \n\nI have had so much stress lately, and multiple people tell me that I am too hard on myself and I need to be as kind to myself as I am to others... Has anyone else had luck with this? I understand that the people who have told me (boyfriend, step-dad, mom) truly mean it, but I do not know how to. And I know how nice and kind I am to others (not to brag) but I have always been so cruel to myself... How do you go about appreciating your own worth and being kind to yourself? 
3	I understand what you are going through, and I think quite a few of us on here are the same way. At least I now I am. Now, I'm not going to say I am always kind to myself, I'm very critical of myself. Something I like to do when I get frustrated with myself is write in my journal, just take some time out of the day and write. Now, after I am done writing I will go back and read through everything I just wrote, usually I will realize that I am getting worked up over silly little things. What works for me might not work for you, and I still am very critical of myself but it does help :)
3	I think it's in our nature as ISFJs to have lofty goals for ourselves and feel disappointed and ashamed if we fall short.  One thing I've been practicing is allowing myself to treat slip-ups as learning experiences on the journey toward the ultimate goal rather than as failures.  When you widen the timeline for a goal, you give yourself more chances to succeed - and ultimately, to reevaluate what constitutes success.  I have a broader definition for the word than I used to.
16	Just found out im ISFJ	Recently this week (also found about this sub) i stumbled upon one of those test quiz sites to determine your personality and i just took it. Ive done it before but never believed these, bit like zodiac signs. \n\nBut this time i did some more research and looked into the ISFJ and it felt pretty strange and accurate. Its really weird to find out so much about myself at the age 29 (Male) when i really thought i knew myself. \n\nNow im reading through most of the posts and its really funny and fascinating to read about other ISFJs. As im reading im also understanding things a bit more. \n\nI dont really have something to tell or say here, but since there are so little posts around i thought id drop by and say hi. Please share about how you found out you are ISFJ and what did you learn after knowing you are ISFJ? \n\nPlus whats the deal with all the ENTP here? 
6	For the longest time I thought I was ISTJ but after retaking more tests recently as well as studying the Fi/Te and Ti/Fe I realized I do lean more towards ISFJ since many big decisions in my life were more people-oriented than task oriented. I did know I was definitely ISxJ though with how quiet/shy I am as well as tendency to undersell/not talk about my acheivements and such.\n\nAs for ENTP, well it's the complete opposite of ISFJ so it's interesting to see how interaction with someone of your exact opposite would be like.
3	I have taken several tests that all pointed to ISFJ. It is really not like the zodiac, when you think about it. If you have a good enough understanding of your own personality, you could theoretically figure out your own type without ever taking a quiz for it because it is all about where you fall on the spectrum of each of the four traits.\n\nI think one of the best things about learning my type was just realizing there are other people who process the world the same way that I do. There have been so many times on this subreddit where I read something and just went, yes! It isn't just me. Also, I've seen several sites describe the ISFJ as something along the lines of a people oriented introvert. I've always felt this weird internal conflict where I care deeply for people and am fairly good at social interaction, but am extremely hesitant to open up to them and build lasting relationships. So reading about the ISFJ type has shed a bit of light on that.
4	Who is/are your favorite fictional character(s)?	My #1 character is Akari Mizunashi from an anime Aria the Animation. She's a very idealistic and cheerful/friendly person. She always finds enjoyable/positive things about even the most mundane of events/things and is just a generally very open-minded and very positive person. I look up to her in these regards.\n\nAnother character I really like is Dwight Schrute from the Office. He's an overly by the books and serious business type of guy and a lot of the stuff he says is just hilarious.
3	I have many from different series!\n\n**1)** Vaas Montenegro from *Far Cry 3*.\n\n**2)** Booker DeWitt from *Bioshock Infinite*.\n\n**3)** Jim Halpert from *The Office*.\n\n**4)** Rick Sanchez from *Rick and Morty*.\n\n**5)** Dipper Pines from *Gravity Falls*.\n\n**6)** Garnet from *Steven Universe*.\n\n**7)** Nick/Ellis from *Left 4 Dead 2*.\n\n**8)** Trevor Philips from *Grand Theft Auto V*.\n\n**9)** Ayla from *Chrono Trigger*.\n\n**10)** Stitch from *Lilo & Stitch*.\n\nThere's no order. I like them all for different reasons. I also just wanted to do 10 characters. There are probably more.
2	I tend not to have favorite characters or any that stand out to me most of the time. Davos Seaworth from the Song of Ice and Fire books so far has been one of my favorite characters ever as I've always really strongly identified with him.
1	I have 2 personal favorites Brutus from Julius Caesar by William Shakespeare and Author Dent in Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.
1	In no particular order:\n\n(1) Selina Meyer from *Veep*\n\n(2) Lin and Suyin Bei Fong from *Legend of Korra*\n\n(3) Azula and Katara from *Avatar: The Last Airbender*\n\n(4) Dr. Sofia Lamb from *Bioshock 2*\n\n(5) Marshall from *United States of Tara*\n\n(6) Bellatrix Lestrange from the *Harry Potter* series\n\n(7) Lana Winters from *American Horror Story: Asylum*\n\n(8) Annie from *Community*\n\n(9) Shoshana from *Girls*
17	Dating an ISFJ	I was seeing an ISFJ for a while, I'm an INTP/ENTP (male), it's really right on the line. Anyways it ended, somewhat mutually. I'm now looking at the profile of the ISFJ and it's shockingly accurate and I've kind of realized I don't really know many ISFJ's so the mindset is pretty foreign.\n\nI met this girl at a college event, she's a senior at the school, I'm 24 and just moved to this city to work. Anyways, I was visiting some friends and got separated and ran into her and started talking to her. I was pretty drunk and honestly I wasn't looking for anything serious. We ended up talking until around 7 in the morning and saw each other around 10 times over the next 2 weeks. I found out she's a virgin and can count how many people she's made out with on fingers so for her to kiss a stranger the first night she met him was a pretty big deal. I don't know how universal this is.\n\nThe first two weeks were great and then everything kind of starts to fall apart. I want to know her opinions and thoughts and feelings regarding different things. I want to go explore outside and see what she's all about but it's a locked vault. I let her know I like her but I can't have the kind of relationship with someone where there isn't clear communication. I realize now after understanding the ISFJ a little more that it takes a while for ISFJ's to warm up, which is the complete opposite of me. After a frustrating experience of trying to get her to open up we both kind of decided the whole thing wasn't worth it and walked away.\n\nCan someone articulate maybe the ISFJ mentality in terms that I could understand? To me it just felt like a rejection for me to open up and be so forward to a placid response. Obviously it probably wasn't smart of me to pressure her into articulating or explaining what was going on beneath the surface but it's just such a foreign concept, I didn't know how to handle it. Anyone have experience with the ENTP/INTP and ISFJ relationship?
9	I can probably help with this, seeing as I have dated and ENTP before, which like you, did not turn out very well. The biggest issue would be opening up emotionally, you never want to pressure an ISFJ. It takes time for us to open up, we tend to be shy and cautious when it comes to dating and relationships. I mean it took me 2 weeks of very subtle hinting before I finally told my ex I liked her and asked her out! In my case she pressured me into opening up before I was ready, and that made me a little angry with her. Granted she pushed me outside of my comfort zone in many ways which led to more resentment to the point of not loving her anymore. If your ex is anything like me, she's probably not very good with words and doesn't like to be rushed, so she probably wasn't rejecting you it was just not knowing how to respond or deal with the situation. Dating an ISFJ is like trying to feed a squirrel, don't make any big sudden movements and make sure to be patient. Let us come to you when we feel safe and ready to share. If you want to know anything specific from my relationship feel free to ask! :)
6	I knew before opening this thread that you'd be an ENTP (or, are one some of the time, I guess). ENTPs seem to be fascinated with ISFJs and want to know all about us. They post a lot in this sub.\n\nAnyway, I'm an ISFJ and I'm married to an ENTP. Our relationship is pretty great, and part of why it's great is because my husband doesn't regard my emotional/sensitive side with pity, but wants to support me in any way he can. He loves acting as my protector and comforter, and I love receiving his care. For example, sometimes when I'm in public, something will happen that basically shuts me down. It could be that my credit card isn't working at a register and I have no other means of payment on me, something like that. I have difficulties dealing with unforeseen circumstances that mess up my day, and tend to freeze. My husband will effortlessly resolve the situation and forget it ever happened three minutes later. He has no problems helping me out when I need it.\n\nThis isn't to say that I'm incompetent and need his help in all things, but it's nice to have him there, filling in any inconsistencies I have (and I do the same for him). \n\nAs for the girl you dated, the fact that she's a virgin was probably a big factor as to why your relationship might not have worked out. It sounds like she hasn't had a lot of physical/sexual relationships so far, hell, maybe not even a lot of emotional ones, so it would take her longer to warm up to you entirely. I can't explain why, it just...is. That's how I was when I was younger. Of course, once you'd known her a bit longer, I can see her opening up a lot more, even volunteering information. I LOVE being asked questions by people I'm very close to, but I hate it when acquaintances or strangers do it. There's a big difference when it comes to comfort level.\n\nHope this helps with future ISFJs you come across. Just be patient, and for god's sake, don't regard us with pity! ouch, haha.
3	(ENTP) My mom is an ISFJ, and she won't tell me her thoughts/feelings. She thinks that I won't understand. I also think it makes her feel nervous/bad to talk about her personal thoughts/feelings for some reason. She's just a private person in that aspect. But she'll talk about stories from her past openly. She also claims that me not understanding her has to do with her being 40 years older than me, though. So this might be more of a mom/daughter issue than an ISFJ/ENTP issue. If I were you, as long as she reassured me she liked me and wanted to be with me, then I'd keep seeing her even if she's a private person. She won't be private forever.
1	ISFJ, my boyfriend of 3 years is an INTP. Promise you, it is possible! But the opening up thing is something that took us awhile and honestly is still an issue from time to time. I don't want to speak on behalf of every relationship because that is unrealistic, but I know the biggest thing for me was patience. When I'm closed off, sometimes his first thought is that I am not trusting him enough...if I really trusted him, I would have no problem telling him whats up. In reality, it could be any number of things. I probably don't want to burden him. Or maybe I'm just trying to figure out a way to express it that will make sense. Either way, I know that pressuring me or trying to speed up the process is kind of counterproductive. It puts extra stress on me and makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong. I recoil and then opening up takes even longer. I think the most important and helpful thing he does in that kind of situation is just say, “I'm ready to listen whenever you're ready to talk. No rush.“ That is comforting to me and makes it go a whole lot smoother. Like another poster said, normally after that I'm ready fairly quickly.\n\nLike I said, I'm definitely not trying to speak for everyone, but hopefully this gave you a little bit of insight. I'm waaaaaaay far on the introverted side of the scale, and we have certainly had those fights about why I'm so closed off. They're never productive. Patience really does go a long way with an ISFJ, but I think the rewards of it are pretty sweet. The more opportunities I'm given to open up to a person, the easier it becomes.
1	There's already really great advice here, but I'll weigh in. Currently dating an ENTP (and most past BFs have been ENTPs..I'm ridiculously attracted to them). I think the biggest thing is communication. I find that ENTPs have a hard time understanding that ISFJs have a totally different style of communication! For me, it takes awhile to truly warm up and I need a fair amount of alone time to reset. Sometimes ENTPs take that personally when there is no need to.
7	ENTP here	When you think of this personality type who and what do you think of? I am curious since we are opposites.
2	My two best friends are an ENTP and an INTP and we get along surprisingly well. Textbook descriptions of ENTPs and ISFJs make it sound like we would never, ever get along but we manage to balance each other out quite well. I've complained to my ENTP friend about how I feel too much and he joked that ENTPs don't feel anything so I guess that's the kind of perception I have of you guys. You guys seem to be very confident and have a carefree attitude that I'm kind of jealous of!
1	My bro friend is an ETNP, and we get along super well
8	Give me a source or something that without a shadow of a doubt distinguishes me as an INFJ or an ISFJ	
4	[deleted]
2	I've never been in doubt about being an S so I can't personally vouch for any article, but [this page](http://infjblog.com/2014/11/01/type-analysis-infj-or-isfj/) describes it based on the function stacks of ISFJs and INFJs.
1	There is a video link in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/2ze1se/isfj_or_infj/) which was apparently very help for the OP.\n\nGood luck!
1	IMO, ISFJs want to help people just as much an INFJs, however feel that the best way to do this is by doing things for them. \n\nFor example, my ISFJ friend loves being matchmaker. For a friend who was depressed about being single, he said "The only way I can help is by taking him out to meet girls". In the same situation, I feel that the INFJ would think they can help the most by instead sitting down and counselling this friend, working at changing his state of mind.\n\nThe ISFJ is more hands on, giving real world practical help, and INFJ are more prone to giving lots of sage advice/wisdom, and boost the persons spirits. It's all in the way Si/Ni  interacts differently with Fe.
13	Revealing your true self	How do you reveal your true self to others? How do you get past the need to keep to yourself, scared of what others might think?\n\nHow do you learn to burden others with your problems? Even more than that, how do you accept that others might not think of it as a burden?\n\nHow do you decide if you can relate to someone? Why do I decide almost everyone I meet is incapable of being my friend? I am so quick to judge that someone is not "my type" and I can't "reveal" myself to them...\n\nWhy can't I find a friendship like I read about in books and saw in movies? Why can't I instantly connect with another person and form a life-long bond... I know these just don't really happen irl but I am so longing for it...\n\nI try. I *do try* because I spent two years doing it the hard way and waiting for people to come to me before I started going to them. But even then, they just don't see in me what I wish they did. They don't see what is underneath my layers. They don't return the conversation. They don't ask about me after I ask about them. The conversation dies. I'm back where I started.\n\nI guess it's too late for me to make friends in college. I only have a month left. But where did I go wrong, and what can I do in the future?\n\nI have learned that *I* have to be the one who starts things... but how do I find the right people, and how do I receive reciprocation?\n\nI see everyone on campus walking with their friends, but I walk everywhere alone. I drive my classmates to field-trips and they sit in the back of my car and chat but won't keep a conversation going if I ask about their plans for the weekend. I see the sorority girls posting their group pictures on facebook and I am jealous I do not have friends to hang out with and take pictures together to post.\n\nI am sure I will find a friend some time. But in the mean time, I'm so lonesome.
10	Here's my take on all this. \nThere's yourself that everyone around you sees, the public figure. Then there's the you that close people know, friends, family, lovers, your intimate side. Lastly there's your side the is only known to you, it's hidden in your mind. Revealing your true self to someone is all up to you, what is your true self? Is it a story you never told anyone? Is it finally expressing a feeling deep inside. It's just hard for me to answer to specifically when I feel like this is a person to person thing. \n\nBurdening others.. I kept everything in for years and didn't get help, it landed me with self-harm habits and I nearly committed suicide. I needed a push to get help for myself. My boyfriend at the time came with me to therapy and told my therapist how unwell I was. He asked me for permission to do this, saying yes was something I didn't even care about anymore at that point. I was done. Open up, if you can do it, if you're lucky a close friend might sense something in you being bottled up.\n\nMaking friends is hard and really hard sometimes. I've come across a lot of people that ended up being awful to me. But I'm forever optimistic and will continue to try my best with socializing heh. Be open to every person you meet, just try your best to look at them and drink in all their details to figure out what they're really like. Instant connections are fantasized more so. You don't always immediately click with people. Chat with them for a bit, ask if they like something you like. Could be a movie, video game, music, whatever suits you. Try to find some common ground so you can stay interested and comfortable as well hopefully ha.\n\nGoing to people can get tiring eventually, and waiting never works for me. You have to watch for and hold onto people that want to put in the same amount of effort as you do. It's hard to find but there's a chance. \n\nListen, if you're really lonely I'll chat with you anytime. I relate a lot to you with seeing people together happy and doing things. The pictures on facebook got to me heh. As petty as it makes me feel I just want that because it feels good to show off the people I love. Sorry if this is scrambled I kind of puke ideas out when I'm interested.
3	Someone answer her!\n\nI have the same questions..
3	I feel the same way. My husband and children and I moved across the country last year and I have yet to make a friend I can feel comfortable talking to. 
0	i feel the same way as you do. its very hard for me to show people who i really am. I display a very different personality on the outside, because of this i can actually be quite chatty and social and funny. still  i feel I really want people to see whats on the inside, but at the same time i do not want to share. i have had made 1 really good friend in university. an ISTJ. he was my roommate and took me a year before i considered him as friend. +\n\n\nthere is a community of ISFJs on the personality cafe forum. just google Personality cafe. its really great to see all the stories people share and the struggles they face. 
9	Which other personality types do you tend to be the most drawn/attracted to?	Is there a specific MBTI type you find yourself mainly attracted to?\nAnd on that note, which ones do you get along with the best?
6	Not a specific one but I love extroverts. It works well with me because I'm not very talkative and extroverts fill the talking void and get me to come out of my shell.
6	I tend to get interested mostly to INFP and ENFP women, but since the INFP are usually too shy to make first moves and the ENFP seem to prefer mostly other E*** relationships over I***, it's not so good.\n\nEdit: I've just found out [this type compatibility chart](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/c5/95/d7/c595d7e69ab2afa27ffb0a6f66ac125e.jpg). No wonder why I'm still loveless. lol
5	I've made a post on this before heh. Anywho, I've always been drawn to INFP's in specific, dating one now. My ex was an ENFP. As for getting along with it's usually the INFP's or other ISFJ's, of which I've only met one other one. I can get along with anyone but it's easier with other introverts naturally.
4	[deleted]
4	[deleted]
2	SO is an ISTP!  Apparently I draw in INTJs quite frequently, but I have no idea why.
4	I seem to always either be drawn to INTJs are have them drawn to me (honestly not sure which way... Maybe a bit of both). \n\nThat being said, I only really have a few friends and most of them are online friends. There is one girl I've known on school just from all out classed together and we are starting to talk more (partners for two different projects) and I told her about mbti and she said she'd take the test... But i honestly could not guess what type she is - - definitely not intj or isfj so that only leaves uhh 14 other options lol. 
19	Do you guys have a tendency to get way more involved in a relationship than the person you're with?	Maybe this is just a problem I'm having, but I feel like I get way more invested in a relationship than my partner is.\nI kind of go overboard, and I know it's not healthy, but I don't know how to stop myself.\n\nI sort of make my life revolve around them a little too much.\nThey enjoy the attention, but it becomes a huge problem if they don't feel the same way about me, or if they end things, because it feels like there's such a huge hole in my life when they're gone.\n\n\nI do have hobbies and other things I enjoy in my life, but I really struggle to not let a relationship take over my life.\n\n\nI end up thinking about them very frequently throughout the day, I put in a lot of effort to look nice for them and give them love, support and affection and gifts, and I start planning my future around them.\n\n\nThe big problem is that I tend to be drawn to types like INTPs.\nAnd while they're wonderful people, they function very differently, so they never seem to have the same enthusiasm or commitment when it comes to the relationship, and it seems like I'm the one who hurts the worst when it ends.\n\nDoes anybody else struggle with this? What do relationships typically end up like for you guys?
7	While this might not be a popular opinion around here, I just want to share my perspective. I'm an INTJ subbed to you guys because I want to understand my ISFJ SO better, but I just asked her about this topic and we are on the same page. I'm just as enthusiastic about her as she is about me, we focus on each other more than on anything else. I don't really find meaning in supporting others witt the exception of a special someone, so I channel all my attention to her and she is not scared away by this like my previous love interests, on the contrary she really enjoys it.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is, and I'm by no means speaking on behalf of the entire NT population, I know there are a lot of loners, but there are people out there who will find your attitude the most attractive thing there is, so just keep an eye out.
7	Honestly, it is always the reverse for me. The men I have dated have always been more into the relationship than I have. I have always been the one who ended it. I know it is common for ISFJs to put their partners on a pedestal. I think the best thing you can do is take time for yourself to do things that interest you so you can spend time outside of the relationship bubble you have created. \n\nAt the same time, the commitment and love that ISFJs often shower there partners with is also very respectable, there just needs to be a balance. \n\n
4	This was how my first relationship was... A codependent mess on my part. It was very unhealthy for me. Where my life literally revolved around them (not accepting invites to go out with friends so I could stay home to talk to him, ignoring my mom bc she didn't accept him, picking a school close to him, giving him my money to gamble with,...) I was basically his robot that did whatever he asked and couldn't ever tell him no. \n\nIn my current relationship, I have worked very hard to not be codependent yet still be very devoted to my boyfriend. I think my first relationship has made it difficult to ever reach that same level again. Which is fine by me. 
4	I don't really have much to add you've summed up my experiences pretty well. Hobbies and friends are what I usually try to turn too but like you said relationships do tend to take over a bit as well. My personal thoughts on the matter are that my natural tendencies to want to support and help others all get focused onto one person. I can't speak for you but for myself I would find it almost unreasonable for someone else to meet me at that same level of involvement that I can get to. Trying to redistribute that level of involvement to not solely focus on your partner but to involve yourself with others is the best thing I've found to help. 
3	I am the same way for the most part. I tend to take things probably a little to far for my own good, especially with relationships. Like with my friends I'll bend over backwards to make them feel better when they're down to the point of smothering. It's even worse with relationships though, I'll drop everything I'm doing to make sure they get what the want and are comfortable. Of the women I have dated, all three ended up taking advantage of this or got abusive, but that's a story for another time haha. It's not easy to change, but I have taken time off from dating to work this smothering problem. Like DolphinShades has said, focusing on others and not just your partner is really helpful. I know you'll figure out what works for you, and remember to not be afraid of asking for help when you need it :)
2	Every tiem ;-; 
2	It depends and can go both ways for me. I have been in relationships in which I barely felt interested, and vice versa. Most of my relationships end up being very long term. 
7	How did I end up here?	How is it that as a result of being easygoing and attempting to succeed at LIFE (not just a job, but at life) and giving it my all, I have still ended up feeling like I haven't gotten anywhere? I am not trying to whine, I am just trying to understand and see if any other ISFJ's feel the same way. I struggle to keep up at work and don't feel I have connected well with anyone there. My ENTJ husband and I have struggled, but worked at it, and have been together for 10 years. My daughter is more like him and they demand a lot of attention as well and so I struggle with work/life balance all the time. I love them and want to give them everything I can, but feel so often like I fail in that and in work because I can't give everyone my all. It is not until recently, that I finally feel like I am being given "me" time by my family and that he is finally recognizing that need. At this point, though, I am exhausted and depressed. My husband and daughter are constantly going, going, going...I love being active, but I need down time, too. I try to have time for friends, but I have never really had any close relationships since high school. I live in a small town, as well, and it is even stranger being in a small town and feeling the way I do. I can't go to the grocery store without seeing people I know, and that used to be how I would unwind - grocery shopping in the middle of the night where I know no one and it is empty. 
3	Just wanted to say, I know the feeling you describe of wanting to just go walk somewhere and not have to see anyone you "know" and fake it.\n\nNew relationships are hard to forge, but take comfort in the ones that you do have. It sounds like your husband finally understands some of you needs and is trying to give you your space. Perhaps pick up a hobby that brings you outdoors, like gardening on a weekend morning where you can be at peace and out of the house.\n\nI hope everything works out for the best, wish I had some good advice...
9	Where's Everybody?	Hey everybody, I just discovered Reddit the other day and just found you guys! I was just curious why there seems to be so few of us ISFJ's on here and over on the MBTI sub. I was also wondering if anyone else doesn't really like the MBTI sub, they seem to be a little hostile to us ISFJ's and I can't seem to figure out why. \nThat's all! I love the sub so far you guys and gals seem like a great little community! :D 
4	[deleted]
3	I feel like we're pretty quiet here mostly, it surprises me going and looking at another area, ENFP for example and seeing how active it is heh. I do also notice that other types either post here to compliment us or ask for advice about us. I like that though, I feel like we can give some good advice to other personality types with ISFJ's in their life. I like this place, there's just not always a lot going on. I check in pretty often though, makes my day better.
2	I'm a quiet type, must explain the no-posting thing also hehe.
3	I'm fine with the MBTI subreddit. I enjoy the various posts on there. I haven't noticed any hostility towards ISFJs (haven't really seen any other ISFJ commentary other than myself tho, so...) honestly the subreddit that bothers me is /r/sensors because it's full of trolls who are trying to incite fights and always have a bunch of "_______ are the most stupid type!" posts... (I'm already upset just thinking about how much I dislike it ><') \n\nI think that ISFJs seem the least represented because, well, you said it yourself. You only found reddit yesterday. I usually don't participate in these kind of forums, but rather \njust observe and see what other people say. Or maybe many ISFJs don't delve into mbti theory? 
1	Welcome! I am not currently subscribed to the MBTI subreddit but am pretty interested in typing. Feel free to make any posts you feel interested in asking! This too is one of my favorite subs. 
6	Stomach pain	Have you ever experienced some chronic pain to your stomach? It's not food related. I'm talking about some pain/huge discomfort that I feel when I'm upset, overthinking, worried ,anxious. It happens that, because of my sensibility, I suffer at a physical level. I was wondering if any other isfj has ever experienced that. I think that it may be part of our personality but this pain really bothers me. Thank you\n\n\nEdit: thank you guys. It helps to know that I'm not the only one. At times I wish I wasn't that sensitive, but I'm sure I'll improve over time. There are also some positive aspects of my sensibility! 
3	I'm going through this right now. I've got a big project at work that I haven't made much progress on, and some of my coworkers are really getting on my nerves, which is upsetting my stomach and making me even less productive.\n\nI'm not sure if I want to talk to them about it or just try to avoid them, but I'm also trying to improve my diet and get more sleep, so I'll see if that helps.
3	I used to get sharp pain in my stomach from anxiety pretty often when I wasn't coping very well. I think it's best to try and find other things to distract you when you worry and start thinking too much.
3	ISFJ ex experienced the same.  She also struggled mightily with anxiety.  
2	I get [abdominal migraines](http://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/abdominal-migraines-children-adults) whenever I get way too worried or stressed out. Each time, it lasts about 24 hours with chronic pain and vomiting, and I end up in hospital with only a bit of Gaviscon + numbing stuff. \n\nThese have improved after I started seeing a psychotherapist and taking lorazepam, however. 
2	Yes. Sometimes if I'm really stressed I can't stand up because the pain is unbearable. Im a huge worryer and bottle it up, very bad combo :(
2	Only really bad twice, but yes.  The first time it was so excruciating that I had to go to emergency, and the second time I had constant low-level pain and I lost all interest in food for a couple of months thanks to overwhelming stress.  It's gotten better since then (the second time was last summer) but I still have days where my stomach is noticeably upset for no reason other than stress.
2	Not quite the same, but I have a lot of shoulder/back pain which I think is partially from poor posture but also from tensing up due to stress.
14	Do you fellow isfj's enjoy philosophy?	I wouldn't say that I would take it up as a career, but I just really enjoy thinking about the questions that the topic asks. 
8	I do, to an extent. I'm by no means well versed in the teachings of many philosophies, but I have dabbled in certain ones here and there. In my experience, the point where philosophy becomes so abstract that it has little practical value to me, and my daily life, is where I begin to lose interest. Metaphysical questions like, "what is life?" or "what is time?", are not questions I enjoy pondering. Why? Because thinking about these questions, or reading about others thoughts/answers to these questions, has little impact what goes on in my life tomorrow, next week, or next year.\n\nWhen I read philosophy, I want to learn something practical and applicable to my life and things I do. For instance, I have enjoyed reading about the philosophy of stoicism. The idea that I can control my thoughts and reactions to emotions, and other "exterior" influences, appeals to me. It appeals to me because it is something I can use on a daily basis, something which has the potential to help me achieve happiness or calm as soon as I apply it. A philosophy with this type of applicability is what I enjoy, and seek out.\n\nTL;DR: Yes, but it has to be applicable to my daily life.
3	I can't speak for others but I've enjoyed the couple philosophy classes I've taken quite a lot. I've also found myself listening to philosophy podcasts on occasion in my free time. The Partially Examined Life is a great, fun podcast if anyone is interested. Shoutout to /r/philosophy too, they're pretty small and although I don't comment at all it's fun to read. \nEDIT: okay, i checked out /r/philosophy's size, they're huge. my bad. but they feel small, which is nice.
2	I love philosophy, no matter how abstract. It satisfies the introverted part of me.
2	ISFJ ex studied philosophy hahah.  Just to give you another data point!  
8	ISFJs who play multiplayer video games, what class do you guys take?	I imagine there will be a lot of healers here. But tanks would make sense too as it is a "protector" role!\n\nI always choose healer, but then I'm usually too shy to talk to anyone until the mid levels when healers actually become useful (I end up soloing a lot on these multiplayer games... -_-)
8	TF2 medic here. Thousands of hours of dedication to healing those in the frontline. I always enjoyed the paired dynamic and teamwork of an attack class and the supporting medic. All makes so much sense!
4	When I used to play gratuitous amounts of League of Legends I mained support. I almost always played support in ranked, and I really enjoyed it. Plus, it was nice because I didn't have to get into verbal brawls with other players in lobby who wanted a position. No one wanted to playssupport, and I was happy to pick up the slack.
7	Oh boy,\n\nGuild Wars 2: Engineer - I really liked the fact that you could use a gun in a fantasy game. That was a big reason. Also they looked pretty swaggy.\n\nLOTRO: Hunter - I liked that I could stealth and get hits without taking damage for a little bit while they ran towards me. \n\nPlanetside 2: Light Assault - I might be cheating here, but for a while I was heavy assault, but I grew to re-love light assault again. I liked the fact that I could hop around the battlefield and drop c4 on tanks without them noticing.\n\nJust barely played Dota 2, but I enjoyed the ranged assault roles i.e. sharpshooter and gyro copter.\n\nI find myself drawn to ranged roles more than full on support. I always felt support roles were very hard as they require specific button mashing in order to activate spells instead of regular button mashing, which I happen to specialize in. Even so, I dislike being in the center of action as it is often too chaotic to do anything of value, plus all the spells are directed there anyways so I would die in an instant. I prefer to sit a bit away, taking my potshots where I can...\n\nTL;DR - prefer to snipe rather than heal, healing feels too complicated for me\n\n/lecture
5	Archers, stealthy classes, I've also been tank a few times and healer MANY times, whatever fits my mood.
5	I prefer either cleric type or tank type. I just feel that I'm really bad at the damage-dealers and would rather just heal/protect my own team.\n\nFor MMORPGs I was usually the cleric, and now in League of Legends I main support with Nami/Taric mostly. I love ARAMs much more than normals though, because with normals I always feel super bad if I'm not doing well.
4	As a general rule of thumb I like taking the hardest class in order to test myself or the underdog/underused class, for instance, in Destiny I use the hand cannon over any other gun (not a class, I know). In TF2 I pick the sniper 9 times outta 10 and in payday 2 I picked the technician skill tree cause I thought no one in my friends group would pick it (and I assumed correct).
4	Always the tank. Aggro enemies away from friends, and keep the crowd on me
4	I'm always either a sniper/archer class or a melee class in an otherwise gun-based game. I'm quite fond of the berserker class in Killing Floor, for example.
3	For Borderlands 2 I was Zero haha
3	Borderlands 2: Zero TF2: Medic, engineer or Pyro. WoW: I love druids.. I can't tank very well and I'm awful at healing sadly. Too much pressure. Diablo: My favorite is witch doctor now.\nI end up playing a lot of games solo too honestly. It's easier for me and i don't have to worry about disappointing someone.\nEdit: I also prefer archer classes, aside from Borderlands. I like to keep my distance and deal out damage.
3	Borderlands: Mordecai\nBorderlands: Zero\n\nI think I have a typical class lol
3	[deleted]
3	Depends on the game. I see myself as a support tank most of the time. I play bards often. But my favorite times are when i find a build that involves buffing and debuffing at the same time, or life vamp builds. Even in Magic I play lifelink like its my job. Usually blue/black. I'm the guy who holds people while my team punches. I love tank Vlad in League.
3	I usually play mage types...I like classes that can do a lot solo. I played shaman or hunter in WoW, red mage in FFXI, and arcanist (because I get pets to help me) or thaumaturge in FFXIV. 
2	Paladins, or whatever the resident holy warrior class is. I pretty much  always try for a tank-healer hybrid. Failing that, healers or general support. I played support almost exclusively during my Dota 2 days, and I frigging *loved* KotL. 
2	I end up playing tons of dps, but only cause I'm worried I'd fuck up as medic and wipe everyone out.
2	I usually play a healer.  If not, I play a support role. \n\nWoW- mage, hunter, mistweaver monk.\n\nDOTA 2- Dazzle, Enchantress, Natures Prophet \n\nDiablo- Demon Hunter, monk\n
2	I always choose the medic option, I view it as an vital part of the preservation of the teams dynamic.\n\nFor medieval games more often than not I'd go for the archer class.
2	I mostly play roles nobody wants. In WoW i play tanks and healers, in LoL i play jungle and support or whatever is needed. It doesnt matter what i play tbh. I fill what is needed for the team. 
2	medic
2	always some sort of support/healer. All I ever do is provide for the team, no matter what role.\nThat or a tank who just goes in and initiates and takes the blows for the team.
7	What's your sense of humor like?	I have a pretty dry humor and love to make puns when I can. My dad jokingly calls me Jimmy Kimmel because of my sense of humor. What makes you guys laugh?
20	very dry and sarcastic. \n\nSometimes people don't see the sarcasm that i'm finding hilarious in my head and things get awkward. 
13	Very much dad jokes. I can laugh at just about anything though and prefer to let other people bring humor to the conversation.
10	I have a rather sarcastic and dirty/inappropriate type of humor.\n\nI'm not so good with puns though. 
4	[deleted]
3	I'm always the one that's dying of laughter at the jokes that nobody else thinks are funny.
5	Usually dry, sometimes sarcastic is how I convey humor but a lot of stuff I hear or watch isn't funny because it's so predictable to me or it comes to me before or as the joke is being delivered. Something has to be silly to get me to laugh.
3	Witty and sarcastic, it seems to be the consensus around here
2	My sense of humor is so twisted that it's actually sprained.
1	Things don't make me laugh often but when they do, it's all out, sides hurt, can't feel my face. Case in point? This made me laugh for a good 5 minutes. http://weknowmemes.com/2012/01/who-put-a-dick-in-this-box/
1	I have little patience with overused or obvious jokes (the typical observational type humor that has to do with gender, race, or air travel experiences, etc.), which is why I find so many stand-up comedians tiresome. On the other hand, I think potty humor is hilarious, so go figure.
8	How to explain self-love to a male ISFJ?	I have a friend who's a male ISFJ. He is the classic ISFJ with a servant's heart, always doing things for other people--which, unfortunately, veers off into insecure territory. He becomes insecure and wonders what worth he has outside of what he can do for others. I need to help him understand what it means to have self-love and how vital it is to help him live a happier, healthier life. Any thoughts? \n\n
7	[deleted]
3	Yea..I'd love to know too..as a male ISFJ. 
10	What type is your SO?	So just like the title, what's your SO's type?\n\nWhat is the biggest weakness and biggest strength?\n\nI am dating an INTJ and our biggest weakness seems to be miscommunication (not understanding each other immediately but having to describe things multiple times before the other understands) while our biggest benefit seems to come from us being "enigmas" to each other and thus being able to give each other a totally different perspective on different issues + just generally teach each other different ways of seeing the same issue. I am always amazed by how much my boyfriend will delve into a problem/question he is interested in whereas I just would've left it to be and not have ever looked into it.\n\nI will ask him in a bit for his input on what he thinks is our biggest strength/weakness. \n\n---\nBoyfriend response:\n\n> Our biggest strength is that since we have opposite cognitive functions, we receive and interpret information completely differently.  When(/if) we get into a discussion, I can always count on her position to be wildly different from my own.  \n> \n> I can easily see how this might become a problem in a relationship--one person (presumably the INTJ) dismissing the other's opinions.  However, I respect her and therefore her opinions.  And so at least for me, a lot of the times her viewpoints add a human element to the conversation (e.g. poachers are people too).\n> \n> Our biggest weakness to me is how much responsibility we put on ourselves for the other's well-being.  It can stress me out knowing that she's unhappy (especially from something I've done), and I believe she would say the same for me.  I know we both hold back saying what we think sometimes because it might hurt the other's feelings.  I try not to hold it in, and I try to make her feel comfortable and confident enough to not hold it in either.  It takes some time, but it honestly is a relief when she confides in me.
4	INTJ also.
3	A bit late to the game but here goes:  \nI'm an ISFJ and SO is a INFP  \nBeen together for over a year and have lived together almost as long.  \nIn my eyes we go together very well, we are the same level of lazy and talk things out calmly even if we don't agree with each other. We also share some of the same hobbies and don't mind going along with the hobbies that we don't share.  \n-- Funny thing just happened: I just asked my SO this question and his first answer was lazy :D  \nWe do the best we can to show our feelings for one another and we both accept that what I see as affection may not represent affection for him and vice-versa so we try to adapt.  \nAt this moment I don't see much weakness in our relationship but I do imagine that if we aren't careful we could concentrate too much on what the other wants and kind put our own needs aside.
2	My husband is an ENTJ, life is interesting to say the least. We just celebrated 9 years, so we have made it work, but it is not easy. We are both motivated people, just in different ways. We do balance each other. \n
2	My boyfriend is also an INTJ! Is this common, or are we just seeing a bias in the people that are choosing to respond?
2	Hubby is an INTJ as well. Miscommunication is definitely our biggest problem. Just today, I made a comment that I thought hurt his feelings. I dwelt on it all day, asking multiple times if he was ok, and apologizing again. He said he was fine, which as an INTJ, meant that he _was_ fine.\n\nBiggest strength? We have opposing viewpoints on just about everything,  so hopefully our kids will turn out well rounded individuals! 
2	My boyfriend's the ISFJ. I'm an EN/SFP :) \n\nStrength-wise, it's probably that I'm good at coaxing him out of his shell in a gentle, non-aggressive way. I bring him out without being pushy. Also, as one of the more introverted types of extroverts, I appreciate his need for alone time. We balance each other well!\n\nNegatives? Sometimes I need too much attention. :p Also, I love to socialize, which is sometimes too much for him. Also also, I don't always openly express my feelings, so it can be hard to tell if I'm genuinely happy.
1	My SO is an ENTP... we are complete opposites :') we make a great team though, our friends are always telling us we're the best couple around. We do misunderstand each other sometimes and when we get into arguments they seem to last forever. But we always reach a compromise eventually ;) 
1	I'm an INTJ just passing through trying to learn about my ISFJ girlfriend. I don't think we have any substantial issues - especially not around communication. We’re very honest with eachother.\n\nMy biggest “problem” with her is that she’s very wishy washy about her future. She works in a cupcake spot making just above minimum wage, where I’m an upper-income earner and have long plans into the future. I’m trying to convince her to find better work that offers a career, but she’s having a hard time envisioning a career or field she wants to pursue. Her degree is in psychology, she’s a hobby artist, and she just otherwise prefers to spend social time with her friends and family. She has no particular interest in owning a business or anything income-wise really. She applied recently to be a side-walk ambassador, which is another low income job with no future. It’s sort of frustrating, but I’m also being patient – I think she’ll figure it out, she’s just taking time to do so. \n\nIt also helps that she’s not into contemporary affairs, politics or philosophy at all, where I’m steeped into those topics. She told me recently that she was worried that she’s not enough of an intellectual for me, but I really enjoy not having to defend my well-researched ideas. There’s nothing more annoying than dating someone who is both stubborn and ignorant – she’s open minded and carefree – that’s why I like her. \n
1	Well looks like I'm a good bit later, but I suppose I'll respond anyway. I'm actually an INTP dating one of you guys. It's been going great though I'm not sure how to put it into terms of positives and negatives. We've never argued about anything. We legitimately agree on any important issue so it's not really a problem. The VERY few disagreements we have had are on subjects that don't matter at all or are just a matter of opinion and so I just don't argue. Figure doesn't matter to me so may as well do things her way and make her happy :) anyway, all I can say is it's definitely the best and most serious relationship I've been in.
1	My to be husband is an ENTJ. Or types are "novelties" to each other. We are both very happy in our relationship and hope to have many happy years together. \n\nOur biggest strength is being able to adjust for each other's types. For example him being extroverted he loves to be around people a lot more then I do being an ISFJ. So I can adjust to going out more often for him and he in return lets me have a quite evening at home with just him and me. Our biggest weakness is miscommunication with me sometimes thinking what he says has a second meaning, but of course for an ENTJ when they say something that is really what they mean. 
11	Wanting love and unable to find it	Hi!\n\nI was wondering if anyone had any experiences to share with love.  Specifically, what do you do when you feel unloved/lonely, yet you feel like you need someone?  I know the answer is to not look for love and just let it happen naturally.  It's something that can't be forced.  That doesn't stop me from craving intimacy and sometimes feeling worthless/overly lonely.  I want to cuddle up with someone and to feel valued, special, and cute.  I want to get to know someone fully and spend time with them.  \n\nBasically what I'm asking is, does anyone ever get super lonely and self-critical, and how do you cope?
8	I feel this way sometimes. I usually try to take my mind off of it by doing something mindless and entertaining, like watching TV. Then I go to sleep, and I feel better the next day.\n\nI still don't have the intimacy I need, but it doesn't bother me as long as I can forget about it. Sometimes I even feel perfectly content being alone.
6	I went through a stage of this during college freshman and sophomore year. No friends irl, no one to physically touch -- I would get excited when I allowed myself to get a mani/pedi because for a brief moment I would be having human contact. It gets bad when you start to realize "when was the last time another person touched me in some way?"\n\nI tried to allevaite some of the loneliness by talking to my online friends. Whenever I play games, I do it as a social activity 90% of the time (I do play a few single-player games, but largely I play games I can play with people). I just reach out to random people I have played with, and because there are so many eventually you make a few connections. I was lucky to meet a few good friends this way, well enough that they would tell me they love me. This helped me get through a lot, because although I was alone in my own home, I knew that out there there were people that loved and cared about me.\n\nA lot of the time I coped by having... well, melt-downs basically. Hours of crying, hating that no one was with me, hating that I could not be held and knew no one well enough to ask for a hug... And then at the end of these episodes I would try to convince myself I was better this way, that I wasn't meant to have friends, that I just needed to get used to it. I'd try to put on a brave front whenever I went out in public and saw people walking in groups when all I've ever done is walk from class to class by myself.\n\nMY boyfriend and I like to say it was a miracle we met at all because we are both pretty much homebodies. But we met at a small party where I was playing a game like dungeons and dragons when he walked into the room for a drink and someone said "oh hey, you both play league of legends and y'all should play together" so I handed him my game name... We started talking online, and I was much more comfortable with me "online persona" so we got to talking a lot...\n\nWhen I met my boyfriend, I was not expecting it. I was in a stage of having a lot of online friends but none irl. It took me by surprise. I also dreamed of the instant friendship/romance I read about in books and had high expectations and this was much different. Relationships take work, you can get them to the point of "knowing someone fully" but it isn't like making instant grits which is what I always hoped for.\n\nI do still get super lonely, and I am *always* self-critical. I am not sure what can help with that. While I have my boyfriend, I still only really have online friends and no friends I can ask for a hug (although my boyfriend is always there for me). But if you are lonely, I would say reach out to people. It is easier for me to do online-- I just strike up a conversation with someone on my friends list on LoL (and I add random people after games, because even though most don't -- some do accept) and just say something random to start a conversation. It's not a deep, meaningful thing always but the more you talk to someone and get to know them the more conversations you can have with real content...\n\nAs for the self-critical... I am 22 years old and still depress myself. If you find a way to become less critical and more *just happy* with yourself PLEASE tell me. I wish I could treat myself as nicely as I treat others but I just hate myself most of the time.\n\nBut I hope if anything, that you can feel a bit better. I know how truly sad feeling super lonely is, as if no one out there even knows of your existence -- but I do and I hope you feel better. If you ever want to message me, feel free. Here is a quotation which I have always liked and I think relates a bit...\n\n"It would be easy to say that I feel invisible. Instead, I feel painfully visible, and entirely ignored." - David Levithan
1	Generally, usually, most-of-the-time people cope with this by increasing the amount of self-love they give themselves. And generally, usually, most-of-the-time people who love and respect themselves are capable of giving the warmest and most sincere love to others. I'm not sure what kinds of activities you could do for yourself that would help you feel worthy and not lonely. One of my friends got into yoga and meditation and it's worked fantastically for her. She's still single, but she's so much happier. Not only that, but she's gotten out of her habit of falling for virtually every guy who shows interest in her. 
12	Looking for a post from earlier today, OP PM me?	Looking for a post from earlier today about an ISFJ married to an INTJ suffering from depression, asking for advice.  Looks like it was deleted, but I would like to pass on some advice that I've gained married to my INTJ SO.  OP, I can post it here or you can PM me if you would like.
20	[ENTJ] What makes you all so irresistible?	I kind of have my own idea, so that question may as well be rhetorical - but would love some additions. \n\nI think that what strikes me the most, is that you all seem to have all of the bases covered to my opinion. You all seem to be emotionally as well as intellectually ready, people who have tolerance, lovingness and industriousness to fall back on if the outside world does not yield any results. People who have a fairly decent ability in letting their hair down. You seem to not be bossed about by timidity or unwarranted ego, but strike a faultless balance of looking like people who are on standby to be of assistance.\n\nAnd it's why you'll be hard pressed to find anybody with a bad word against you :)\n\n 
25	I don't know about my comrades, but for me, my tolerance and love for others comes at least partly from a lifetime of struggling to tolerate and love myself.  I know how much it hurts to not be comfortable with yourself and wouldn't wish that on anyone else, so I shower others with unconditional approval.
9	I so wish I could hear someone say this in person. I always get anxious if i'm pleasing everyone that I get to interact with. Haha.
3	That's a real compliment haha. I have an unconditional love for everyone in my life. Especially lovers and friends. I dunno. I just want to do my best and be happy with my life and friends. I have such a big heart. They forgive my stubborn and sometimes moody nature. I can have days where I feel like I need to be alone and am not being allowed that time. That's when I get a little short with some people because I really care about my well-being. But, if someone is in trouble I can toss that aside and help out however heh.
1	[deleted]
1	This is so true. There's only about 3 people in this world I've ever been really truly attracted to, and 2 of 3 were ENTJs. They're so self-assured, adventurous, and they just don't give a shit about anyone else's opinion. They're just about everything that I admire in a person (even if they're impulsive and impractical sometimes).
7	ISFJ or INFJ?	For a long time I tested INFJ, and it resonated with me. More recently I've repeatedly tested ISFJ, and it seems like maybe my personality has evolved. I've tried reading the differences and I'm getting lost in the details (is this my INFJ talking?), I truly feel it goes either way and it depends on the situation. \n\nHow do I best figure out which I am? Are there key questions I can ask myself to determine my N/S type? I have a leadership training activity this week and it's going to focus on MBTI personality types. Any help is appreciated!
6	[deleted]
6	I'm not sure, but I think I've become enamoured by the anxious lifestyle.	Since I've started living on my own and working under the fairly serious pressures of college and what ever else it is I do, I think I've come to appreciate relief more so than pleasure for their own sakes. For the record, I've not just had a big exam or anything. I just see it this way; there's, for me, comparatively more pleasure in relief than there is relief in pleasure. I live such a busy and demanding lifestyle that I can never escape the pressure I put on myself. I see seeking out pleasure for its own sake just adds to the pressure since the time I have to relieve myself of that pressure is being wasted without result. That simply doesn't bother me though. In fact, I love this lifestyle. I'm always productive, a little on edge, and everyone around me constantly compliments my accomplishments, which is pretty awesome as an isfj. I feel like I'm living a worthwhile existence even though what I'm doing isn't super important yet, but that doesn't mean it doesn't suck. \n\nAfter doing informed reading and watching plenty of good resources, I've come to the conclusion that taking that much pleasure from relief is a sign of anxiety. Although, I would also like to point out that I do not suffer from anxiety, rather I simply crave such a lifestyle. Whenever I am not aware of that ominous pressure, be it just homework or getting somewhere on time, I feel stagnant. I love the concept of relaxing. I think I believe that I would love to just relish in the sweet completion of my efforts, but I bet the settling of my mind and life would leave me bored. I desire challenge. \n\nI guess I'm also a little curious if I'm alone in this or if it's part of my personality and something for us to commiserate in. I believe that you have to give a little to get a little and giving a little stress and time for a life I can look back on proudly seems pretty worth it. 
12	Do you struggle with small talk and how do you handle it?	I internalize most of my thoughts and find small talk/conversations about nothing to be incredibly tiring. I often don't even have words to say or contribute. If I'm not going to say something important, I'm just not going to say anything. \nIf the conversation topic is something I'm passionate about or extremely knowledgeable about, or the person I'm talking to is, I can talk for hours. I love love love those conversations. The problem is the opportunity for them is rare.. So if I'm with a group of people talking about nothing in particular I typically won't have anything to contribute. This can make me feel awkward/ seen as the boring one of the group. It maybe makes them feel awkward too.\n\nDoes anyone else deal with this? Is something I should even work towards changing?
3	I still feel a bit tense during small talk, but it's mostly pretty easy by now. Generally, I only make small talk for a little bit -- if the conversation doesn't naturally go somewhere more interesting, I'm content to let it die off. \n\nI'm sure you can find tons of advice on making small talk on the Internet and on subs like /r/socialskills, like "Be interested in other people and ask them questions about stuff they bring up", so I won't give you general advice on that; besides, I'm hardly a master conversationalist. \n\nReally, you can try to make an effort making small talk -- and I think you should at least sometimes, small talk is an important step to real, in-depth discussion. But if you don't feel like talking, it shouldn't be too rude to participate only when you're addressed. Like /u/robotrick said, there's a certain value to remaining silent. It's what I personally do when I don't really want to participate. Of course, you shouldn't do that all the time. If a conversation doesn't seem to hold anything for you, it's fine to sit it out, but personally I usually like to say one or two little things, maybe ask some small questions, to show that I'm paying attention for most conversations. \n\n
1	I'm in a profession where I have to do meet-and-greets with the public every now and then, and I've found myself reading off of a list of questions in my mind to keep a conversation going. Once it's done, I can say goodbye and move on, or hopefully they will have already started talking to me about something else.
1	I don't typically enjoy small talk for what it is, but I find awkward silences to be even more uncomfortable. Like other posters have mentioned, an effort needs to be made - and the best part about small talk is, you don't really have to pressure yourself to keep the conversation going beyond what you're comfortable with.
1	This was one of the biggest struggles I've had in life. I feel like I've gotten better but sometimes I get insecure about small talk but as someone else said, I dislike awkward silence even more since I'm afraid of just being boring to the other person.
1	Yes. Me too! Especially with people I don't know really well. It makes me feel bad that I don't know what to say....
5	What are you up to today?	Just a general "what's up?"\n\nThis morning I woke up and cuddled with my boyfriend, vaped, played a few games of League of Legends... Now I'm about to start cleaning the bedroom and then studying for my exam on Monday. I'll probably end the night by by watching some Let's Plays of Rimworld or Prison Architect on Youtube.
2	Man, today has been a busy day!\n\nWoke up early this morning, anxious to try out my brand new coffee grinder. I was not disappointed. Then I had to run into the office for a meeting(on a Saturday, ugh. But they served free breakfast, so that kind of made up for it). Stopped by my parent's place and visited with them for a bit. I also got to see my beloved little dog. After that, I hit up the gym and burned off some of those kolache calories from earlier this morning. Now here I am typing this. I'm getting ready to start doing my laundry. Whilst the laundery is laundering, I'm going to boot up Attilla: Total War and pillage some pathetic barbarian tribes just to the south of me. Finally, I plan on ending my night by indulging in some alcoholic beverages while playing League of Legends with some of my buds.\n\nAll in all, I think it will be a good day.
1	Slept in late which is one of my favorite things about the weekends. Cleaned the apartment while watching some that 70s show and getting high. Now I'm sitting in the shop about to finally get started on my next tattoo and I'm super excited about our
1	Day off. Have sat in bed all day watching Netflix. Am probably going out with a friend later to eat dinner. 
1	I picked up some overtime hours this morning before my regular shift, then grabbed a couple groceries on the way home.  Now I'm browsing reddit and trying to convince myself I'm not hungry, as it's day 2 of my diet.
11	ISFJs Needed for Survey on Sleep Patterns and Personality	Hello Everyone! I am undertaking a project to investigate the relationship between people's personalities and their sleep patterns. This survey will be posted in all MBTI related forums- if you could take it, I would greatly appreciate your time. It is pretty brief, and at the end there is the option to see the descriptive results (percentages of each response to see how you stack up to your fellow redditors). Once I have a sufficient number of participants, I will analyze the data to find correlations between different traits, and then post any interesting findings from the data. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lW19vAWhfaGu_MBDWkZl2KrJkTTGj3nXSvZJOTvEJhg/viewform If this goes well, this could be the first installation in an interesting social science series! Thanks!\n
3	I would strongly suggest rearranging the Big Five survey fields into the order the results are presented on the test site - EACNO - to prevent participants copying over the numbers to the wrong boxes.
3	Also try /r/samplesize
1	Completed! Good luck
12	ENFP (M) dating ISFJ (F)	Hey!\n\nI'm an ENFP who's been madly deeply in love with an ISFJ for the last 3 years, and I just came to thank you all very very much for your kind, loving, nuturing ways.\n\nThere's been our differences:\n\n- I'm super duper spontaneous!\n- She's very very passive in her ways, as where I'm a little more bold.\n- Communication. There's the clear difference in NFP & SFJ\n\nThere's more, though for the key differences we make up in communication; Talk about everything, work through it all, and help eachother where we need help, enable where we can, and let eachother breathe when we need it.\n\nI never thought to settle down and stay as long as I have, but now I wouldn't think twice about changing it :)\n\nMuch love everyone; Just wanted to share!
4	[deleted]
3	Hi there, I'm so happy for you c:\nMy ex was an ENFP and me and ISFJ. We definitely clashed a lot but he got me a little out of my comfort zone sometimes, which was good. I think it's a careful balance you have to form. Him and I should've been better with communication and letting the other breathe when needed. I'm so happy it's working well for you though c: Take care! 
1	Helping An ENTP with his ISFJ mom	Hey there ISFJers.  \nI have come here for some insight.  \nI'll keep this short.  \n My mom and I often miss each other view points and this can result in arguments. Can you guys give me some tips in dealing with ISFJ to avoid arguments. How can I see the world as on ISFJ would.  \nHope this isn't too broad of a question. 
7	We don't do arguments.
2	What are the sorts of things that you guys are arguing about?
10	what are the top five adjectives you'd use to describe yourself?	
11	Loyal, reserved, genuine, pessimistic, and naive.\n\nI'm an Isfj male for the record.
7	Moral, responsible, funny, sensitive, homebody.\n\nI'm an ISFJ male as well! Good question! Have you taken the Strengths Finder test? I didn't want to use all five of them but my second top strength was "responsible."
3	Maternal, timid, understanding, emotional, and stubborn.\nISFJ Female. I agreed with the majority of the others her but I tried to use ones that hadn't been used.
3	Not an ISFJ, I'm an ENFP, but my boyfriend is an ISFJ and I think I can guess how he would describe himself pretty well: He'd probably say reserved, awkward, polite, responsible, and observant.\n\nAnd as for how I would describe him: Genuine, loyal, witty, supportive, and perceptive. Also, calming. That's six but oh well. He's the most calming person ever. Not calm himself, but calming for others.

10	What do ISFJs need/want in a relationship? Also, ISFJ-INFJ dating compatibility?	I'm an INFJ and I recently started seeing an ISFJ. I like him, but I want to know more about ISFJs.\n\n1. Is it normal for y'all to need some warming up time? I saw someone say ISFJs have "layers." What composes each layer from outermost to innermost? What's going on in your heads?\n\n2. Are ISFJs more carefree or intense?\n\n3. What does an ISFJ need/desire in a relationship? It seems to me that the guy I'm seeing may be into words of affirmation/validation because he gives them pretty often.\n\n4. What kind of qualities do ISFJs like in a partner? What qualities turn an ISFJ off?\n\n5. Any ISFJ have experience dating an INFJ? If it worked well, what aspects of the two personality types complimented each other? What made the relationship great? If it didn't work out, what seemed to be the issue? What could help these two connect?\n
15	I cannot answer for INFJ-ISFJ but I'll tell you my experience... Also I am a bit tipsy and rambly.\n\n1) Yes, I need time to warm up to a person. My inner layer is all my insecurities and inner thoughts and things that I think that make me feel like I'm crazy. It's very tough for me to open up, because that would mean revealing how I honestly feel and I have been told in the past I need to just get over things and my emotions are stupid and wrong. I also do not have many friends and it is very hard to meet people I think I would like--I desire like some sort of instant friendship where we bond immediately and know each other's thoughts... but that doesn't exist, and it's so hard to open up to someone so I'm not sure how to get to that stage. It probably took me a year to feel truly comfortable around my boyfriend -- enough to tell him how crazy I thought I was, or to tell him "look, I know it's stupid to feel this way but I was upset about blah blah blah and I can't help it." My outer layer is just that -- kind of a fake mask I put on around people I don't know well and I pretend everything is fine with me.\n\n2) I think I can be carefree -- it's taken a while but at this point sometimes I just walk around campus and give zero fucks and I consider that to be carefree. Trying not to think about what people may think of me. Idk if this is an ISFJ trait, but I often will be thinking in my head and wondering if I am really at the center of something like the Truman Show... like when I walk out of the classroom class stops and everyone starts talking about me. I know it's crazy but... I don't know how to explain why I feel that way sometimes (even while knowing it's not true).\n\n3) I think I need to feel appreciated. Appreciated for doing the minor things. Like I clean the kitchen because my boyfriend didn't feel well, but then want him to tell me I did a good job or something. It's also strange because as much as I want to feel appreciated, I *hate* getting compliments -- I think it stems from a "Well I should do it, so why am I getting complimented for something I should do anyways?" Like I want recognition but I also get embarrassed by it... I would tell my mom not to compliment me while I was growing up because I felt I didn't deserve it for just doing my obligation.\n\n4) I like security. I like feeling like I will not scare away my partner no matter how crazy my emotions may get. I know they're crazy, I need someone to tell me I am not weird and that my feelings are valid. I guess validation is another thing I want, and to feel treated as well as I treat my partner. What turns me off are cheating (on tests or on partners) and materialism.\n\n5) I have dated an INTJ. INFJ (Ni Fe Ti Se) versus INTJ (Ni Te Fi Se) so you both lead with the Ni. Communication has been tough. We miscommunicate often without meaning to. I've commented a lot about it before, so you could probably get a glimpse by looking at my prior comments.
11	I can only speak from experience, being an isfj. \n\nI generally want to feel useful to my SO, her happiness is my happiness. Acknowledgment of what I do for her tends to be a plus. I'm not carefree, but I don't hold strong opinions either, in an effort to remain in a position to support her.\n\nI'm not a fan of confrontation and over-competitiveness. I'm fairly sensitive and I try to keep our prides and egos intact. \n\nI like a partner who is laid-back and open with their feelings. I'm at my best when I feel trusted. I usually have very few words but every now and then I let the floodgates loose when I feel safe to share. So, I appreciate a non-judgmental person, who can contribute positive feedback. 
4	I am female ISFJ with a male INFJ in a relationship for 6 months only. But i will give my 2 cents contribution because I have read a lot of comments saying that INSJ and ISFJ are not compatible. And for me, he is the only people who correspond to me so I want to believe all this theory have limits.\n\n1. We were friends initially which might help to answer to your first question. It really helps to talk to someone to open the first layers. When I realised he could really appreciate me for what i am and understand me it helped to open myself. ISFJ are very secretive people i would say, because we are sensitive so it is a shield and also because we are introverted so it takes time for us to built relation. (the first comment is totaly correct as well).\nBeing in a relationship wont open the same layer as easily than being friend because you can share more openly with a friends.\n\n\nBy talking, we start to appreciate each other. \nAs a ISFJ i am a very good listener, I even built relationship by conversation and common interests. So this is a very important aspect of the relationship moreover at the beginning. It can even happen that you never talk to an other Introverted because I/I do not start conversation easily and the first time you will talk to the person, you will discover how close you both are.\n- As he is INFJ, my listening gave him appreciation and support which was really important for him. As it was important to him and INFJ are very dedicated to others and selfless, he gave me back the same listening hear and dedication that makes me comfortable.\n- His appreciation, which is the most important for INFJ (INFJ put others people first and feeling that what they do for others is appreciated is the best reward for them), our relationship took a step further.\n\n- If you feel you cannot go to the second layer, my advise would be to open up yourself first, which i believe for knowing a INFJ is not something easy and you need trust to do so. You can start with basic conversation about life - any type of sharing will help. Do remember ISFJ are very good listening and emphatic people caring for people close to them.\n- For each layer i would say, we are scared of being criticize/rejected for our idea (the most deeper ideas we have) which seem to be different from other people, as we are sensitive we do not appreciate criticize and we take it very personally reason why we do not want to open or it is very difficult to do so. Moreover, sometimes talking to intuitive type do not give the appreciation or support we need while sharing feelings.\n\n2. Not sure i understand but we are very caring about people and serious about relationship. We only see relationship as long term commitment. \nMost of the time, we hide this part because we do not like to expose our feelings and we are seen are insensitive, cold, distant, rude people even so it is the opposite. \n\n3. Personally my relation with a INFJ is really good because we share very similar values, we are both altruist, very caring about each other feeling, dedicated to others, we have strong sense of ethics (which i appreciated in myself as well as in others people), sharing same values (commitment, upright, genuine)\n\nIt is important for me to find someone who can appreciate myself for who i am and share the  same value (moral, ethical and universal values). I would sy i just love him because he has all the values i appreciate in someone and he is really really good. It is say the INFJ are soul of the world and it only represents 1% of the population.\n\nISFJ share feelings very often and needs to feel secure in a relationship. They need to feel that they are "Still" after few months, few years appreciated; which for my boyfriend is really annoying. For him, he said it once and it wont change.\n\nI read something about ISFJ which give you a very accurate explanation "They need to be needed" ISFJ do everything to suit their partner, we are selfless because that the way we fulfill ourself : by serving others. If others do not appreciate what we do for them, we feel useless and we lost motivation and can become depressed. We cannot fulfill ourself without others thats why we are very good in social work because it gives us a meaning.\n\n4. Values (moral, ethics..) being faithful, trust, all this is included. IFSJ as well as INFJ are very upright and have high sense of loyalty.\nWhat we really hate is immoral people (it wont be your case), lying and laziness, anything related to sins.\n\n5. What complemented each other. Almost nothing cause the only different is between S and N which apparently is not good in a relation because one focus on past and present (S) and the other one on futur and potential outputs (N). \n\nWhat is GOOD in the relationship is that we are similar:\n- it is easier to appreciate someone who has the qualities you really admire\n- it is also rewarding and re-insuring to feel that in the other side, the person recognize your qualities that most of people wont recognise\n- it give a lot of spiritual connection\n- with time you will realize and probably your boyfriend will realize that there is nobody that you can trust and rely on as an ISFJ INFJ.\n\nthe issue is\n1-  when it come to the difference. When there is a problem to solve (pragmatical, financial, anything to plan) you will have two differents points of view. and you might feel like you cannot communicate with each other.\n\n2 - When you will have conflict, it will be worsen by your similarity. with conflict ISFJ (due to feeling - become overwhelmed and can become aggressive while they are waiting for validation of their feelings). While waiting for this validation during a conflict, instead of giving it, INFJ shut down (ignore until the storm is over) which worsen the conflict in the ISFJ point of view.\n\nISFJ become more aggressive and INFJ get lost because they have done their best to stop the conflict by ignore it and it become worst. Thats a very difficult situation to resolve. You need to understand what the other is expecting from you during a conflict (BEFORE a conflict happened) and to do it instead of having your normal reaction. It will come with time.\n\nAm saying, the conflict is worsen by your similarity cause during a conflict there is things you cannot give and you are waiting for the other to give to you (for example for ISFJ it will be reinsurrance). It wont come easily cause we are both IFJ.\n\n3- To help to connect, ideas you shares in terms of relationship, INFJ are very idealistic which is very reassuring for ISFJ. ISFJ need to be reassured and the comfort of the idealist and caring of the INFJ is good for us.\nConnect with all the ideas, values you share. For me, i believe values are very important. The values of an individual make the person good thats how i appreciate him. 
3	My observation with ISFJs.  They are so kind hearted, that they often attract their opposite. - the Takers. -the selfish people.   Yet, they want to see the best in people but it often overlooks their true colors.  Be willing to question your feelings when/if you see  red flags. And don't beat yourself over it for being honest with yourself.   Plus having a quality friend to bounce ideas off doesn't hurt. 
2	I haven't dated an INFJ, but my best friend of 10 years and current roommate (more than 3 years) is one. We get along well because we both have a great deal of compassion. Neither is quick to blame or get angry. \nReally, the only problems are \n\nshe's so idealistic that I can't believe her sometimes. For example, she works in healthcare and she seriously thinks she can help every single patient change. Some days it's inspiring and some days it makes me sad for her. \n\nI instill order to our home by cleaning and organizing. That one of my strongest ISFJ traits, put chaos into order, but she's messy. She just remembers where she dropped something. I "clean" it into what I think is the objectively correct spot, hiding it from her. So I think I should be getting thanked when really I'm frustrating her. \n\nI think that being late is a common trait for INFJ, that hurts my feelings. Like I'm hardly being squeezed in. I want to be a priority sometimes. \n\nBut, we are both introverted, duh I guess, and can just shut our door and not hurt the other one's feelings. That's very important to me. \nShe's been willing to wait for the layers to peel off. It literally has taken years. It is scary to feel the vulnerability of good friendship. She could reject me as weak because of my sensitivity. All in all, I have found the two personalities very compatible. \n\nAnd yes, we absolutely need some warming up time. I, personally, would be put into a nervous frenzy of cleaning and stressing if someone tried to move a romantic relationship quickly. I desire someone who will be encouraging of social outings and adventures. And who will say nice things super frequently, even though I will probably not take the compliments gracefully. \n
11	Misplaced Anger/Sadness	So what makes you angry? I find that really minor things can make me incredibly angry... or maybe frustrated is a better word.\n\nHere's a short list:\n\n* kids getting their parents to buy them expensive cars\n\n* people getting upset at me while I'm driving\n\n* people being unable to see from another point of view\n\nSome examples... I go to a private school and walking near the parking lot is like walking by a showcase of Mercedes, Audis, Lexuses, porsches, Chargers... So many fucking expensive cars and it bothers me so much that kids are getting their parents to buy them these ridiculous cars while they're still in college and don't even have their own jobs yet. My family is well-off and my mom bought me a car when I was 16 (which I know even that is a luxury) and I begged her to get me a cheap, worn-down car because I didn't want to seem like a brat when I drove around. I felt so bad when I drove her Mercedes, like people were judging me and thinking it was mine.\n\nFor people getting upset at me when I drive... I was at a stoplight under construction and waiting for the worker to give me a signal, and I was looking at the wrong person... A few seconds later a lady yells at me "What, are you gonna go or what?!" (because she had been giving me the signal and I hadn't seen). I just felt so bad and was like "I didn't know it was my turn!" but why couldn't she have said it more nicely? Like "hey, your turn now!" instead of angrily yelling it at me. I literally almost cried. And then today, I was driving through a parking lot and pedestrians were walking and so I stopped but one of them had held up her hand in a halt signal... and so I kinda raised my hands to say "I was stopped for you" and then her and her friend start making fun of me and raising their hands and waving them around and laughing and I got so sad. I was just trying to be like "hey, I had stopped for you".\n\nAnd then the third point is self-explanatory... I posted a while back about a comment thread that made me so sad--it was comments under an article about poachers being killed and everyone was like "Good, they deserve to die!" or "On safaris, they should hunt poachers instead of animals!"... Like oh my fucking god, these poachers are PEOPLE too, you can't define them from ONE thing they did. I don't agree with poaching, but I also don't agree with DEHUMANIZING people.\n\nEven typing this gets me riled up... I know that these are just silly reasons to get upset about stuff and I take things too personally... Does anyone else relate to these experiences?\n\nedit: Also what about just emotional investment into "unworthy" things like things that don't really deserve emotional investment... Like getting sad/crying because of a lonely old person you saw earlier in the day or something.
7	I can completely relate. I've always described myself as being sensitive/overemotional because I feel really overwhelmed by things that are trivial to someone else. I cry in any argument with someone, I cry if someone notices I'm upset or unhappy, I get blood boilingly angry at people being rude, disrespectful, or inconsiderate.  \nI don't consider it misplaced however, I guess just a more... intense emotional and personal response. If I could have it another way, I gladly would. It's hard to be so involuntarily invested emotionally in things that shouldn't be taken personally.  \nGeneral things off the top of my head that make me really irritated/frustrated:    \n- People unwilling to own up to their actions, words, and mistakes   \n- People who don't put themselves in the other person's shoes in an argument/situation (similar to your POV point)    \n- People not considering others feelings or willing to apologize for hurting someone regardless of their stance on the situation   \n- People who don't behave respectfully (oh my godddddddddddd)   \n   \nI definitely relate in your reactions to irrational strangers being rude or not reacting politely. From strangers mocking people to saying things rudely, it's all just so unnecessary, harsh, and infuriating. It can really wreck a memory or a day. Why not just be nice and accepting (to those who do no harm)?!    
2	I can really relate to your driving stories. I get especially irritated when you are on an interstate and see that 2 lanes will become 1 and the good majority of cars will begin to merge but then about 10% of cars will just keep going, trying to merge in at the last second. It feels so unfair to me. 
1	Did you get jokes like 'If a quiz is a quizzical, what's a test?' without saying it out loud?	Just doing a survey across mbti subs.\n\n[relevant image](http://i.imgur.com/bRrnp9l.jpg)
7	Yes. I don't think I heard this before, but I knew where the joke was going once I read 'quizzical'...\n\nbut as I think of other similar jokes, I would have to say...\nI need to heard out loud/see it written out.
1	Yeah. I read a lot so I'm used to this stuff I suppose.
9	I'm an INTJ dating an ISFJ, any tips?	I'm the INTJ (23 Year old male) she is the ISFJ (20 Year old female). She's very mature and self aware for a 20 year old (and I'd like to think I am too) so there are never any major blowouts, just small miscommunications, but eventually the cycle can get tiresome, we've actually been pretty good after some good talks, but just want to keep our A game up, haha.\n\nI guess an example of recurring themes: she sometimes sulks for a few hours here and there when I don't pick up on cues or when she assumes I'm distant (but I'm just trying to be productive). I find it troubling when she assumes the worst in my attentions and goes off on a tangent to sulk. She wants consistency and be affirmed that she is appreciated, and I'm very poor at this.\n\nI can't always spot these "cues" to pick up on, when I try to be extremely aware of the present it can be exhausting. \n\nAny tips? \n\nEDIT: Format
6	You will find that our types are "enigmas" to each other; INTJ has cognitive functions Ni Te Fi Se while ISFJs are Si Fe Ti Ne. This means we pretty much are on completely different wavelengths.\n\nI love talking about this pairing because my boyfriend is an INTJ and I'm an ISFJ and are both 22 (you can look though my past comments to see other threads about this same topic). Like you said, we have had "small miscommunications" and large ones too -- it's extremely frustrating because often we will *think* we understood each other, only to realize days later that we both meant something else completely. An example: I mentioned a backpack I had that I was surprised he didn't like, he said he did like it, and I was like "weird, I thought you said you hadn't but okay" -- days later it comes up again and it turns out we were both talking about different backpacks without realizing it. We just *think* in such different ways, it's weird.\n\nI have had to get comfortable enough with my boyfriend to tell him when I am upset. In the past, I did just hold it in and not want to mention it and he was totally oblivious it seemed. At this point in our relationship (a little over a year together) he can tell when something is wrong and I know not to hide it -- I tell him "I feel stupid about how I feel and it's embarrassing that I'm upset over this because it's not a rational upset... but if you give me a few minutes to work up the courage to say it then I will. You just have to wait ten minutes for me to muster the courage" and then I will tell him what is bothering me.\n\nISFJs (at least me) take a long time to warm up to someone--sure we try to be outwardly nice to everyone but I have many layers and I take a long time to peel them back because I am very self-conscious and just do not completely open up easily. I am not sure how long you and your girlfriend have been dating, but maybe she is still scared of being completely open about her feelings (she might think that her feelings are wrong or stupid? My previous two relationships both taught me that I was stupid for feeling the way I did and my current boyfriend has had to tell me over and over that it is *okay* to feel upset or angry about things).\n\nIf you have any other questions I'd be happy to answer because I really love talking about this, lol.\n\nedit: If you search in the INTJ subreddit for ISFJ/INTJ topics you will find more posts like yours, asking for help about how to make it work... a lot of the times INTJ commentators are very dismissive of this pairing because they think ISFJs are overemotional crybabies or something, so that always makes me sad to read haha. But they still provide the insights that you are searching for.\n\nedit2: [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/2u6la2/intj_and_isfj_experiences/co5wfhp)'s another of my comments from a while ago:
-2	>She's very mature and self aware for a 20 year old\n\nHaha !  Oh this is so rich.  Can I have her number after you guys break up ?  (2 months)
13	Found a newish ISFJ description	http://www.celebritytypes.com/blog/2014/12/pierce-presents-isfj/\n\nI really enjoyed his writing on [functional axes](http://www.celebritytypes.com/blog/2014/12/determining-function-axes-part-2/) too. In fact I really enjoy reading up more on MBTI things. So my first question is what got you into MBTI? And do you really like to learn more about it? I always read up on my type and my boyfriend's but I don't try to learn too much specifically about other types.\n\nHowever I've always been into things like matching my horoscope to a friend's and matching MBTI's and seeing what it says about our relationship-- is this something anyone else does?\n\n
1	I found out about MBTI in college and my closest friends and I all did quizzes to determine our types (I was INFP at the time, this was about 6-7 years ago). I had always been intrigued by horoscopes and the apparent truths to many of the characteristics of certain zodiac signs and got to the point where I could guess at someone's sign after knowing them for a short time. My interest in MBTI has lingered but kind of took second place since then. While interesting, it's harder to 'study' than the zodiac because you need to have an extensive understanding of both sides of each trait (I vs E, S vs N, etc.) to be able to figure someone out, whereas horoscopes only require you to know someone's birthday. \n\nI do have a friend who has read extensively about MBTI and she correctly identified me as ISFJ before I even retested myself. I don't know if I'll ever get to her level of dedication, but it's nice to know it's possible. :)
1	I heard about it online. Personality quizzes are always a fun time so I took one and got INTJ. I only somewhat fit the description so I tried a different test and got INFJ. Still only half-fit. Tried a third quiz and got ISFJ. The description was scarily accurate. I guess the accurateness was what really got me in. Normally I frown upon things like horoscopes (I'm supposedly an Aries but I am the exact opposite of an Aries so hearing about horoscopes in general annoys me because of how obviously fake it is) But this seemed so... true. And I was learning things about myself that I had never realized. So I see it as a sort of tool for learning about yourself and how you fit in with the world. I find myself mentally typing friends and family and find those to be pretty damn accurate as well!\n\nBasically, I guess what got me into it was that I was seeing actual truth behind it. That, and I like trying to understand other people and how everyone thinks differently. I typically only learn about the types of close friends and family. I like reading about how we all fit in together, and how their brains work. (Which I also see truth behind.) Personality in general just interests me.
1	Hubby is an isfj. Totally a loyal protector, quiet and wise in his own way. Why he wanted the flakey, flighty me is anyone's guess.
8	Dog breeds for ISFJ	Does anyone know if there are any suggestions of dog breeds/temperaments that mesh particularly well with ISFJ? \nObviously it will vary some from one person to another, but generally speaking. Thanks!
5	This is kinda interesting. I never thought about dog breeds meshing with certain types. For me I am in love with dachshunds. I'm partial to the long dogs for some reason. I also like jack russels because they are just fun-loving. Not really into the big dogs.
2	I'm no dog expert but from what I've heard, all dogs take on the personality of their owners
2	I'm not really sure about this. I had a yorkshire terrier but we never clicked. Big dogs are my thing personally. Great Pyrenees are my favorite though. All depends on what you're looking for. I only had that breed because we had animals for them to look after. Big friendly dogs make me happy heh.
2	I have a black Labrador, her name is Onyx and she is incredible, but she is getting on in years had her for about seven years now. We clicked right away, and she's a rescued pet in quite the literal sense as she was being neglected and abused by her previous owners. To this day I still can't pet her without her wincing a bit, but I see no harm in admitting that she was stolen from vile individuals that surely would have let her die in their backyard. Two weeks later and she was obeying even advanced commands that take way more time and dedication than the average canine. \n\nThe only bad habit she has is getting into food when she is not supposed to. I strongly suggest a dog in the labrador family as they are not temperamental on a whim and they are great cuddle dogs faithful and friendly even when others are not.   
6	Advice please?	So I've been sorta seeing this guy for a few weeks but I'm pretty sure we're not like... "dating" (it's so hard to gauge these things for me!) but we've both been invited to mutual friend's party in a few days. I don't want to be out of line by kissing him when I see him or something... What's the protocol on that type of thing? I'm very sure I'm over thinking this but it's seriously stressing me out. \n\nEdit: I was worrying for nothing. Snuggles and kisses all around! :)
2	a) you can kiss him and see what happens (maybe do it at the end of the night?)\n\nb) you can wait until he makes a move\n\nc) talk to him ("so are we official?")
1	wait till he kisses you.  you can hug him. and touch him.  like hold his hand and stuff.
0	off my chest. INTJ	She is an ISFJ and she has some medical issues and is a little pale.  Despite that she is breathtakingly beautiful and her voice, when she says my name it cuts through all my thoughts.  It stops my brain.  She hates me.\n\nI am 40 years old and single and never married.  Yes a 40 year old man who is single and never married is a miserable failure in life.  Yes there is so much wrong with me.  Yes most people hate me.  Everything you would expect of a fat miserable man at 40 with no reason to live.  I am everything everyone makes fun of and hates.  The guy who can't get "laid".  The guy who read comic books.  All that stuff.  Anything bad about a man you can possibly imagine that is me.  This isn't why she hates me though.  We have been kinda friends for like 2 years.  I tease her all the time, because I dont want her and people at work to think I am interested in her.  I am sure I took it too far.  Despite all that she talks to me still.\n\nAnd she sends me an email now and again.  And thinks of me when she sees something on TV and tells me about it, that I might like it etc.  And sometimes she even talks to me in person.  And she is so beautiful it is hard to look at her in the eye.  And she always looks at me in the eye, staring, wide.  Sometimes I look strait into hers.  I have no idea what she is thinking.  I dont really know what I am thinking when I do this but I feel connected.\n\nI think we may be friends now her and I.  I make allusions of how horrible my life is.  I think she gets that I am depressed and have lost the will to live.  I have no idea what she knows or not I try to keep the conversation light.  We only ever went out once after work for a drink.  I just want to hold her once before I die.  I want a lot more than that but, I am 40 and she is 26 and my body doesnt even work anyway.  Fuck you all.  Fuck you and your judgements.  Why does she talk to me, just being nice I guess.  I hope I die soon.  Maybe an asteroid.
12	What's anybody supposed to do with this information? I feel like I just read a long anti-joke.
9	I am not sure what you want with your post. Are you trying to figure out her reasons for talking to you? I feel as though many of us can see when someone is in "need" and want to alleviate that for them -- we are definitely carers/nurturers.\n\nShe is pretty young for you. She probably wants to be friendly but I would not look too far into it. My boyfriend and I are INTJ/ISFJ and I am surprised you say you sense a connection with her... we often are thinking extremely differently from each other (Our functions are all inverse... ISFJ = Si Fe Ti Ne and INTJ = Ni Te Fi Se).\n\nHonestly, you sound like you could benefit from therapy. I definitely have episodes of extreme doubt in myself and everything around me and I know I need it. I am sure you are more accomplished than you believe. But do not go after this girl expecting her to make all your troubles go away. We often take on more than we can handle and don't know when to leave a bad situation/how to say no.
4	This is such a thoroughly non-INTJ post... \n\nNot saying you're mistyped or anything. Maybe you're just really unhealthy, stressed, or for some other reason stuck in shadow functions. \n\nI hope you can find goals again. \n\nI hope your feels heal.
2	Another INTJ here. What have you been doing to try and solve your problems, OP?
2	She just seems like a very caring, genuine person.  Obviously you two won't end up together, but if nothing else, she should have at least restored a little hope in you that caring, genuine people still exist.  I'm talking about people who look beyond the exterior to see if there's anything of value inside.  By the way, after reading several of your posts I think you do have value and you need to stop making excuses(fat, unhealthy, old) for being miserable.  Excuses are immature.  
1	I hope you find happiness some how, some way. (Hugs)
