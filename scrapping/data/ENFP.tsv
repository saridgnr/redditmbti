21	Unofficial (for now) Official ENFP Discord Server	https://discord.gg/HytWPA9\n\n~~I've went ahead and messaged the mods about officially having a server being made for the subreddit but I've also already gone and set up a server that can be used as a general starting point. There's a few basic roles, bots and channels and it's 100% a work in progress and it isn't in any way official (yet). If the mods want to take over I'll gladly hand over control but for now this is the server we have.~~\n\nIgnore that, we're official!
1	It's official!
1	It's fun!
1	Is there a good activity?\n\nI want to improve my english (I'm brazilian), so I think I could get a little help from fellows ENFPs\n\n:D
1	If you're on the fence about joining, come on in! We're pretty welcoming.\n\nAlso we like other types as long as they like us. :D
189	Lonely ENFP guys on the Subway be like..	
21	Relatable. I sometimes remember that girl I saw in a subway in Rome 5 years ago. Damn I'm strange... 
16	I feel attacked 
14	It burns because it's true.
9	Omg
10	This is me when I've been behind a car on the highway for 2 hours and they get off at an exit before mine
7	Oh man, sometimes I miss a girl I met online and chatted for a few minutes only.\n\nA lonely ENFP = a depressed ENFP. :(
6	c'est moi
6	Too true. 
4	oh god too real
3	Are you all serious, really? Just talk to her! No matter the image you pass to the other passengers, it's your life!
3	Oof. Felt this one. 
2	Damn you idealistic fantasizing!!
2	Picturing Michael Scott staring through the blinds... 
2	Me: A ‚Äúlonely‚Äù ENFP, pfft please!\n\nInside on the verge of tears:\n(PLEase!...WHy)
2	Ugh, too true.
2	This is why I'm doing my best to develop my S and T. One day I'll be able to be ESTP in the streets and ENFP in the sheets.
2	Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
1	I'm hurt.
1	hahahahaha i love this sub :)
-6	Too flat a butt. I wouldn't imagine much.
59	Me: why wont anyone take me seriously? Also Me: *takes life advice from a show with a pink cat as a celebrity agent*	
18	LOL - dw I always take life lessons from Animes\n\nI think ENFP can see the beauty and truth everywhere. Most people think it needs to come from a "reputable" source.
16	Princess Carolyn has great advice! "You gotta get your shit together! You're a star!"
9	Ok but that show has really good life advice? Don't belittle yourself.
7	Um.....bojack is superior to any tv show existing don‚Äôt feel bad 
5	Bojack?
2	Terry crews! He is cool.\n\nAs an ENFP i have to say I am being serious before doing something.
2	Hey, you‚Äôve got to take the lessons in life no matter what they‚Äôre packaged in! I often go back and get moral lessons i‚Äôd forgotten from Disney movies üëçüèª \n\nAnd you know.. for the nostalgia üòã
19	Be a winner. (Albeit a distracted one)	
2	Fuck me this is my life.\n\nIt's SO EASY to help others.\n\nCan I not have my personal goals, self fulfillment AND helping others?  FOCUS.
1	honestly this is how the world should be today 
3	I can't get over a girl I hardly got to know and I need help	As I understand it, feeling over attachment to someone who you hardly know is a common trait among ENFP people. So I was wondering if any of you have had the same problem and if so, how did you get over her/him? \n\nQuick back story: We met at an party a month ago, we chatted and it felt like we really got along well. After about an week of texting she choose a different guy over me. Sense then my life has been a living hell :( can't stop thinking about her, need help 
3	This more about you not being able to get the girl than anything.\n\nYou haven't accepted your fantasy is not real.  Look fantasies are great, powerful and an ENFP can build amazing things from them.\n\nIf you're not taking actions to make your fantasy a reality then WTF are you doing?  Take actions or let it go.
24	Are you guys ever about to put on a song/movie, and you're like "Nope. I'm not strong enough for those emotions right now."	For me it's "The Little Prince." I love that movie so much, but it also takes so many emotions out of me. If I'm already tired/exhausted, there's some emotions that I'm just not as capable of feeling. It takes energy haha
6	YESYESYESYESYES. Songs. And I recently kinda forced myself to face certain emotions with a song! Terrible, but the aftermath? Totally worth it. 
3	When I feel that way what takes over is the thought "There's probably something better I can do with my time."\n\nAnd if I'm smart I do the better thing.
3	Haha there maybe like 4 songs reminding me a close and fucking nice period of my life I just can't listen without be nostalgic as hell, so I'm never listening theme 
4	I love dying out of raw feels, Interstellar for me
2	That film tho........\n\nFor me its most films that aren‚Äôt comedy, whenever i am in a group situation i am not 600% comfortable with. Aint nobody going to see me ugly cry. 
2	OMG THIS HAPPENED TO ME 2 HOURS AGO. I randomly thought of a song I used to love but that gave me feels, played it, and stopped it after 10 seconds. Too heavy. "Pictures of You" by The Last Goodnight
2	I'm AAAAAALWAAAYYS like that! the reason why my entire life isn't watching movies is that I know I get too attached and carried away by them
1	Sort of, I like to put a show/ song on that compliments my mood 
1	ALL. THE. TIME.
1	Literally did this last week. One of the first times I felt like I could actually ask that we not watch something because I knew I'd have a hard time fitting in that much compassion when I already felt like shit. Ended up renting A Star is Born because everyone was going on about it...should've read the synopsis first.
3	THOUGHT YOU GUYS MIGHT BE EXCITED AS I AM...NINTENDOGS FOR THE SWITCH IS COMING!!!11!!111!1!11	
5	About to meet an INFJ guy	I have a coffee date in 2 minutes with an infj, any tips hehehe\n\nWish me luck hehe
3	Don't talk over him, give the man some time to breathe and talk too. Listen to what they have to say. Don't boast too much about yourself and be careful with the limits. If you notice certain topics make them hesitant, don't keep asking about it no matter how curious you are. Show them your kind and nice side, pay attention to little details he says and bring it back up later in the convo to show you've been paying attention, etc... And don't fake too many smiles, only laugh when you mean it. INFJ's see right through a fa√ßade or fake actions.
2	INFJs are into helping others. If you can show that you're that social activist kind of girl they'd be really interested in you. 
3	I think I might be ENTP...?	I always seriously identified with you guys...I'm spontaneous...have 20 tabs open at the same time usually, fall for people in the course of 5 minutes...cry at movies...cry in general...all that jazz...I love helping people...I love memes and stuff like that...\n\nBut my friend told me she thinks I'm more of an ENTP because of my quick wit, my love to just sort of be dominant and my love of arguing...and my ability to manipulate people if I want to.\n\nI've always been good at manipulating people...which is a bad thing. I wouldn't say I'm a sociopath because I definitely have morals and I don't do immoral things just for the sake of personal gain or being immoral, but that doesn't stop the fact that I can manipulate people if I want to.\n\nThe other thing is that I love arguing. I can argue about literally anything simply for the purpose of arguing...I will also plow through peoples arguments with no regards to feelings if their argument has nothing to back it up. I will call out someone using appeals to emotions or basing arguments simply on emotion by presenting facts, even if it offends them and makes them hate me...I only feel bad after but during the time, I get so heated that I just don't give a flying fuck.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also think the world is doomed and there's no hope for my kids or anyone else simply because humanity is headed down the drain and soon we'll live in an orwellian state. I'm also conservative which I heard isn't common for NFs...\n\nI'm also UBER competitive about almost everything.\n\nI don't know which I am...
2	You could be an ENTP enneagram 2.\n\nWhich sounds like a cool combo to me.
2	This is making me doubt myself too. I always typed as an ENFP (except once as INFP when I was pretty down) but the things you describe sound just like me. I love arguing, but not in the mean way or not even to be right. I just like debating things, seeing different sides of stuff, people talking passionately about how they see the world. It really activates me and brings me to life.  I've also been told a lotttt that I'm pretty dominant in general, even during internship where I was told to "know my place" I'd still bring up new ideas and fresh thoughts into the workplace, to dismay of some colleagues. I'm also a master manipulator IF I want to, which is almost never the case. I used to manipulate a lot for personal gain, especially as a teen. I knew what people wanted to hear but I'd twist just a little here and there, tell the whole truth but just present it slightly differently etc.. So if people would go asking others about things I told them, they'd get a near identical story so they wouldn't question the small details. I was pretty "evil" back then and dark, consumed by emotions and pretty selfish. I grew out of it thankfully. Now I still use those but on a very small scale, like during job interviews or internships, I'm horribly good at lying too. I know exactly what people want to hear and I can talk passionately about things I literally give 0 fucks about. I never do it with friends and family though. I just couldn't do that to people I love. And if I do manipulate, it has no negative consequences for anyone. It's just to make me look better so I'd have a better chance at getting a job or passing an internship. I'm also extremely competitive when it comes to something I want to win, like seriously get out of my way or you'll get hurt and I will be a very sore loser.
1	Read these and see if they apply more.\n\nhttps://www.sociotype.com/socionics/types/IEE-ENFp/  This is Socionics description that corresponds  to MBTI's ENFP\n\nhttp://www.sociotype.com/socionics/types/ILE-ENTp/ This is Socionics description that corresponds to MBTI's ENTP\n\n* Note Socioics Introvert Types are different than MBTI Introvert types, due to the "naming scheme" a person strong in Ni and Te such as myself would be called INTp / ILI in Socionics and INTJ in MBTI.  This is because both are based off Jung and both are 16 type theories but they never synchorized their grammar when they were developed independently.  (Socionics is Russian MBTI developed in the 1980s to today, MBTI is American 16 type theory developed in the 1950s to today but it didn't really become anything close to it is now till the 1960s with other people like Harold Grant and so on.)\n\n-----\n\nI bring this up for to tell an ENFP and ENTP apart you need to figure out which of these are more applicable.\n\nENFP has 4D Fe and it is unvalued for 3D Fi is priortized.  ENFPs love Fe but Fi is a more stable outlet of energy^(longterm) so it is prioritized.\n\n* ENTPs conversly have 2D Fe but it is valued over Fi which is only 1D.  Fi is still important to an ENTP but it is learned through experience, while ENFPs like to play with their Fi in order to balance their priorties and figure out what to focus on.  Fi is a game not for a sake of being a game, but Fi is still a game for figuring out the game to an ENFP is like having a compass that was spinning wildly and beating that game's level will suddenly make the Compass point in the right direction.  (Yes this is a Pirates of the Carribean metaphor, even though Jack Sparrow is an ENTP and he needs an external magic totem to access his Fi, but with ENFPs that compass is built inside them as a super-power.  Instead they need an external map, an external Ti map to help them figure out how to use their compass.)\n\n---\n\n^(Skips writting more trying to be brief, but feel free to ask me questions for I have more to say but I am not sure if its useful, but if you give me questions aka context I can tell you useful things.)
1	30 Pounds	It‚Äôs March.  Soon enough it‚Äôll be summer, and I will be at the beach with my friends.  And for another year, just like every single summer of my life, I will be too embarrassed of my weight and my scars to take off my shirt and swim.  \n\nI used to dream of being a lifeguard.  I would watch them save someone and wish it could be me.  I wished I was strong enough, thin enough, to run down the sand into the water and help someone.  I don‚Äôt dream of that anymore.  \n\nI was a swimmer as a kid.  My dad taught me to swim as soon as I started walking.  By age 8 I was in the ‚Äúguppy‚Äù swim team at the local club.  At age 10 I won first place in the butterfly stroke.\n\nBy age 12 I was beyond ‚Äúhusky‚Äù and my weight started getting negative attention.  I was humiliated every day, and I would go home and bury myself in PlayStation and snacks.  At age 16 I was 245lbs and wore pants and long sleeves all year to hide myself.  That was the first time I ever looked in a mirror and said out loud to my reflection ‚Äúyou‚Äôre fucking disgusting.  I HATE you‚Äù\n\nI started doing drugs heavily.  I got into the crowd quickly and by age 17 I was selling LSD, pot, oxy and Xanax.  I had an unlimited supply of prescription amphetamines.  I was so high all the time on a mixture of drugs that I only ate once every other day.  I was playing music at the time, and between not eating and sleeping and rocking as hard as possible every night I got thin.  I went all the way down to 185.\n\nAt age 19 I was still up to my bullshit.  I loved how I looked in clothing, but my body was covered in deep scars and loose skin.  Again, disgusted with myself, I spent another summer watching everyone else have fun.  \n\nThe band broke up and the drug train stopped.  I was 23.  By my 25th birthday I was 330lbs.  I couldn‚Äôt even make it up a flight of stairs without a break.\n\nI joined a gym for the first time in my life.  At the gym I met someone with an adderall script, and immediately bought him out.  I joined a powerlifting club, and stopped eating.  At the end of that year I had reached 205 and actually had some definition!  My abdomen, however, had been more scars now.  This devastated me.  I couldn‚Äôt get any pills at this time so I upgraded to Meth.  In no time I was addicted.  I was snorting meth 2 or 3 times a day just to get through work.  My productivity was off the chain and I won awards at work for my accomplishments.  Those awards should have gone to my meth dealer.  I reduced my weight, again, over the next two years.  I got to my lowest, 180lbs.  I had more muscle so my skin no longer hung off me like a weird coat, I just had the scars.  I didn‚Äôt even really mind them now.  I went to the beach, took off my shirt and swam in the ocean.  It was so liberating.  I was so happy.\n\nI realized that my drug problem was out of hand.  I quit meth and any other drug, just smoked some herb and drank beer on the weekends.  Without the meth I was RAVENOUS all the time.  I couldn‚Äôt eat enough!  I was so damn hungry.  \n\nSkip to my 30th birthday.  I was in decent shape, blood pressure was good, my gym performance was awesome and consistent.  But my weight was still at 210lbs and I wasn‚Äôt happy with my jiggly love handles.\n\nI attempted suicide.  I failed and my wife saved me.  I spent a year just existing.  No gym, no food control, I barely even showered.  I got on some decent meds and felt a little better and got back to the gym.   I was 230lbs.  \n\nSince then I‚Äôve tried HARD to control my diet and get my workouts in.  I failed, a lot.  I now weigh 234lbs and I hate myself more than ever before.\n\nI guess I wanted to get it off my chest.\n\nThanks for reading.  
1	think about what a setup this is for the most inspiring story anybody ever heard.   i have a story too.  most people do.  you are not alone.  and you can turn your life around.  especially if you are an ENFP. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
359	Probably not exclusive to ENFPs, but I felt this alot, and I feel you guys will too haha	
38	This reminds me of the first time I went to an onsen (japanese bath). Our boss was always generous and wanted us to experience japanese culture during our stay so he thought it would be nice to treat us to one. We felt like it was rude to decline the offer so we just went.\n\nI was nervous but not as nervous as my friend. We both had anxiety but she was way more wound up than I was. More socially awkward etc. We were the only foreigners in the womens bath. Naturally, we received a couple of stares. But aside from that they were cool. I just said fuck it and stripped while chatting my friend up, not mentioning our nakedness, to ease her anxiety. She did the same shortly afterward.\n\nI have to say it was the one of the most liberating things i have done. And i'm glad i was able to make her experience it, too. (Common baths are not a thing where we come from)
22	Damn that really hits. Also when it comes to talking to strangers when I'm with friends VS when I'm alone ahah
20	My friends ate mostly introverted. So around them I'm considered the designated extrovert and I'm unstoppable
8	Ahhh yes, I am familiar with the mom friend loophole. 
7	I would never call myself motherly. I‚Äôm more the ‚Äúcool aunt‚Äù type. But heck yeah this is me in mom mode. Had a friend fall and get hurt in a haunted house once and instantly put all my fear aside to calmly ask the next monster where the emergency exit was.\n\nMonster: arggggggggh!\n\nMe: yeah hi! I just have a question! My friend fell and hurt her ankle and we‚Äôd like to get her our ASAP. Which way do we go?\n\nMonster: uhh... you can go to the right out that door\n\nMe: great thanks!
7	I never related to something more. I think it‚Äôs kinda because I play the role that needs to be played. Like if I realize that I have the most dominant personality in a group then I feel obligated to be the leader. \n\nI can‚Äôt do shit for myself but if I feel like I‚Äôm the most capable or confident in that moment then my confidence is amplified.\n\nFor example I usually take the back seat in social interactions with my finesse god friends but when I‚Äôm with my more awkward friends I behave in the exact same way as the friends that I normally take the back seat too. 
3	Yep unstoppable if we‚Äôre looking out for someone else. 
2	Yes why is this üòÇüòÇ
2	My bro has really bad social anxiety and I'm not great either but it led to me being the one to make all his purchases for his right up until I moved away for college.... and then his girlfriend had to step in. He's not as bad now though but my mom friend instincts probably prevented him from learning it wasn't so bad much earlier üò¨
2	YES IT IS SO WEIRD. The moment I need to do it for someone else, I have the full confidence and assertiveness to do it. Why is this?\n\nThis also happens when I need to do an emergency thing for someone, like a speech last minute because someone can‚Äôt do it, I just feel great about it.\n\nIt‚Äôs so wild how people oriented I am.
1	Omgoodness all of this.. 
1	I can relate to all of this soo much 
1	My two best friends are INTPs and one of them is really really shy and whenever we‚Äôre at a bar and she wants another drink I am ON IT. 
1	So accurate
1	That‚Äôs because it has less to do with anxiety and more to do with how much you value yourself and view your own worth as opposed to how you view it for others. Yes... even for ketchup.
1	I'm INFP and the same! Like Courage the Cowardly Dog haha 
1	\nOmg why is this so true.
1	First time a post on this sub just hits me so hard. I actually never noticed I do this until now and damn, that's so true. 
1	Also reminds me of my friend who called me to ask for a favor to kill a roach in her room (which is what I'm super terrified of). 
1	Yes, I'm normally so afraid of bugs, anything creepy crawly, but when there is someone who is more scared than me, you bet I will deal with the bug with my bare hands. It's quite the adrenaline rush. Protector mode on. 
41	Triggereddd	
7	Today I just bought two books about this. One was about how to be more charismatic and one on how to make people feel happy and comfortable around you.
7	why would you attack me like this in my own home?
2	Relatable. I've got a giant box of self improvement and business books lol. 
2	What‚Äôs with the random good boii? üòÑ
1	How do you know it.
1	Ahh so that's an ENFP thing hahaha
10	ADHD does not = ENFP	There was a post a few days ago about ADHD = ENFP. I don't think so. I think many people with ADHD read the Ne description and the ENFP description and think they are ENFP. And some people with ENFP think they have ADHD when it is just Ne. There are certainly ENFP's with ADHD, but that applies to every type too.\n\nMaybe it's because I'm a mature ENFP (32) and have developed my Fi and Te a lot and Si. But I don't identify with the lack of attention span. I have great attention span and I use it to gather up all the new information I can take in constantly. I will give up on projects often but after working on them for quite a while. And I come back to them. I am not loud and hyper either. Maybe when I was a little kid but not since then.
4	Yeah, basically ADHD = not able to focus / ENXP = not wanting/preferring to focus\n\nDifference is whether you have the choice or not. People dont get this, lol.
3	I agree, I've never had a problem with focusing. Yes, we are easily distracted when something more interesting comes along, but it's not an ADHD thing.
2	I am both, and I agree that they are absolutely different things. But yes, ADHD may lead people to skew towards Ne-leading types that might not actually be the basis of their personality - and I do believe there's an overrepresentation of ENFP/ENTP ADHD folks that may be due to this mistyping.
1	Just pointing out though that the childhood ADHD and adult ADHD are not expressed the same way. ‚ÄúLoud and hyper‚Äù are more associated with childhood ADHD. \nBut I mean I agree with you that not every ENFP has ADHD.
1	I probably am both, but is is really hard to discern between the two. Sometimes I am scared I dont have adhd and that I am just an enfp.\n\nI got officially diagnosed with adhd, but the people who diagnosed me did not know about cognitive functions. What if they misidentified my symptoms? \n\nThis frustrates me quite often, the uncertainty.
1	As a person who is both, the crossover is impeccable. Of course I am alot different when medicated and am not sure if I even qualify as an ENFP well on medication.
1	Thank you for saying this. \n\nThinly made associations between MBTI and mental illnesses are the types of posts that make me want to rip my hair out.\n\nI used to be an admin on a forum a number of years ago that had a mental illness section and let me tell you, asking a bunch of strangers on the internet if you have a mental illness is the worst thing you could possibly do. Think you have a mental illness? Go see a psychiatrist who can properly assess what‚Äôs going on. Casually trying to label yourself (or a group of people for that matter) with mental illness just because certain traits that are present seem similar is as bad as going on WebMD, looking up symptoms and thinking you have some rare disease or disorder.
3	Tattoos	How do you guys feel about them?
2	I got 14 of them, most are kinda big, legs are almost full. I want to be covered eventually except for my hands, neck, boobs and private parts.
1	I‚Äôm blasted up 
1	They hurt but I just can't help myself
1	I think they're pretty cool. I like asking people about their tattoos, but I don't have any myself. No plans to get any either, though that could change in the future.
1	41yo, made my first tatoo 2 months ago: pirate smile on the right middle finger.\nAlways fascinated by tatoos, but my focus on having open options has stopped me doing so.\nNow I‚Äôm planning to make other 2: on the neck (a letter) and on a leg (dancing Tony Manero üï∫)
6	Russian Doll on Netflix	Has anyone else seen this series yet?\n\nIt is how I view life. Every connection has a universe of implications associated with it. Everyone means something. No one is of no consequence.\n\nI resonated deeply with both the male and female main characters. There was messaging both about how we deal with our upbringing as children as well as how that translates to adulthood.\n\nA lot of feels right now. Honestly I just really enjoyed it and would love to know how fellow ENFPs feel about it. 
2	I have similar views as you stated, loved the show!
1	Sounds interesting. This goes right onto my list.

2	How to deal with fellow best ENFP friend who think's you're literally stupid?	Alright, so I'm a 24yo ENFP woman and one of my best friends is a guy who I'll name Greg, aged 21. We've been close friends, although long distance, for 3 years. I visited him about 3 times in the past 6 months for a total of nearly 2 months so I saw him a lot. I had a lof of fun with him and his friends every time.\n\nWhenever I'd get back home, we'd argue about silly things though. This basically means whenever I had a view on something or an opinion and he didn't agree, he'd call me stupid and say I got a 2IQ intelligence etc... I got used to his rants because it became so frequent and stopped taking it personal. However, after our last argument he blocked me on all social media. We're still friends, but the messages are blocked. It's the first time this ever happened so I was taken aback. I asked a mutual best friend who lives in his city to let him know that I miss him. Apparently he doesn't care and said he's done with my attitude.\n\nMy mutual friend, Sarah, said there are many things about me that bother him apparently. The way she put it, is that he said that he has no problems being friends with a good person (which he thinks I am) but he just can't stand stupid people. He called me dumb etc before a lot but it became so frequent, that I thought it was just a joke or something. Apparently he was serious about it, dead serious. She assured me she doesn't think I'm stupid. In fact he's the first person I've known who has ever thought that I'm actually stupid. His mom, friends, all of my own friends I've had, my teachers,... always said they thought I was pretty smart. I also have 2 bachelor degrees and studied 6 years for those. Always been a good student, often in the top 3 of my class. So he's literally the only one who thinks I'm stupid.\n\nHe often called me stupid during arguments where our views didn't match. He always thinks he's right. Most of his friends aren't the type to argue, but I'm pretty headstrong too. So if I have an opinion, I will express it. But I never say "you're wrong", I say I respect his opinion and then share what I think. I never say I am right because I think everyone has the right to have their own opinion. But he just thinks my opinions are too stupid to understand.\n\nNow I'm at a loss here. Sarah also said she thinks it's his problem, not mine and that he's the only one who seems to see me that way because she certainly doesn't. If he'd ever talk to me again (which I'm not even sure about if he will at this point) I kinda decided to mellow it down with him, talk about less serious stuff, and if we do talk about serious stuff, I'll kinda go along with his opinion to avoid fights. I know this is not the typical ENFP way but he means more to me than arguing about certain topics that have nothing to do with ourselves or our lives directly. What do you guys make of all of this? He also has a flair for the dramatic. I used to be almost exactly like him around his age, quite explosive and forced my opinion on others so I can somewhat relate. But he's also dealing with a lot of stress and depression so this can have an impact too.\n\nEdit: Don't advise me to ditch him. He is a good person overal, this is the only issue. I have acted exactly like he has in the past too so I can somewhat relate.
2	Just FYI, most ENFP's aren't like that. Your friend just has an ego problem.
1	He's so annoying.. sorry you had to deal with a brat.
1	My instinct would be to drop a person like that. Doesn't matter what he's going through, he doesn't respect you enough to listen. Let his other friends take care of him and move on. You can't help everyone mate. 
1	Around what age did you yourself notice that you developed extraverted thinking (Te)?	How did you know? 
4	When I finally stopped wondering whether 5 and 9 were sad or happy numbers and decided that I don't want to fail calculus. 
1	Pretty late, only since this year I think so I would have been 24,5 years old. I did possess some of the qualities already, but being more open minded, use more logic and seeing things from different points (and accept them) developed in the last few months.
1	I was ... 12 I think? well... no, maybe earlier. The thing is, I started telling stories I made up on the spot for my friends to go to bed more easily when I was 9ish. That laid the foundation for me :/
1	When I realized I needed better friends... \n\nFor me, that was 18. But I've felt that surge of extroversion at several points in my life, usually when I needed new people. \n\n18: college\n\n23: moved to a new city\n\n32: needed to get out of a bad relationship
2	Out of 16 types, 8 are light and 8 are dark. ENFPs are one of the 8 light types:	
6	I get used to seeing unscientific self-congratulatory posts here, but this one is in a league on its own. Am I the only one who feels it‚Äôs almost hurtful to denounce half of the types as dark/amoral?
12	Hopeless infatuations with people who dont like you back	I guess I need help. I am hopelessly infatuated with someone who is clearly not interested or unavailable or both. Point is my feelings arent being reciprocated. And here I am day dreaming about this person, And beating myself up for doing that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am in a lot of pain. It hurts. I wanna destroy my feelings with fire. I have tried so hard to be over him but its not working. He's a classmate for a class that I really need to take so I can't avoid him. We are friends so we sit together so if I started avoiding him completely in a class this small everyone would notice. I am just in a lot of pain and I am suffering.  \n\n\nThis is a cry for help. Someone please advice me on how I can move on from this. 
5	It's a problem us INFJs face on the regular as well. If I ever figure out how to move on, I'll let you know. All I can offer is my solidarity.
2	Hm, I think it could help to realise more strongly that it's an infatuation. I don't know what your definition of it is, but it's borderline to obsession. It's less related to genuine feelings, and more to a compulsive desire to want them or to be with them. I used to have this too but I grew out of it I guess. Even when I have very strong feelings, I can somewhat control them by being realistic and confronting myself with the truth. With some people it's harder than others, but eventually you will get over them and you have to keep that in mind. This feeling won't last forever.\n\nBut if you haven't confessed yet, it can't hurt to do so. Even if he rejects you and you see him every day, you will have your answer and stop torturing yourself. I think it's the "not knowing" that eats you up the most. Just get it out of the way so you can finally move on.

1	You may just have to wait for him... \n\nI know we crave instant-passionate-extreme-blazing-fire-that-nearly-kills-us-love-stories, but he may be slowly crawling towards the idea of you. In the meantime, be a great friend :) \n\n&#x200B;
1	Why does it matter if you avoid him and other people notice? This is about your needs, who cares what people think?
1	How long has it been since you‚Äôve realized your feelings weren‚Äôt reciprocated? Just curious. \n\nIf he 100% clearly stated in some way that he doesn‚Äôt feel the same, take a moment to step back and look at things objectively. \n\nKnow that moving on will take time but you‚Äôll get there. Try not to fantasize about him suddenly reciprocating your feelings.\nRemember you deserve someone who will love and appreciate you as much as you do, to them. \n\nTry to remember the bright side...maybe this didn‚Äôt work out bc the world has someone else waiting for you to join their journey in life in the future! \n\nSure it hurts now...but ask yourself...will this REALLY matter in a couple years? Will you still be that hurt? \n\nIn the meantime, hang out with some different friends in your spare time...meet new people, find an interest/hobby that makes you happy, and soon enough you won‚Äôt even be pining/suffering anymore. \n\nIt‚Äôs okay to be sad, just don‚Äôt be hard on yourself. \nI‚Äôm assuming you know a lot of great people in general but might not want to date them...this is a good way to remember that sometimes rejections aren‚Äôt really about US. You are still a great person, but maybe not the best match for him...this doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre not amazing!! \n\nBest of luck...you‚Äôll get there...it‚Äôs just a matter of time and riding it out.  :)
1	Keep going for him until he breaks down from your sheer force of persistence OR you understand the pain you feel is all your responsibility then you get the freedom to get any guy you want.\n\nHarsh but true.
0	I can so relate to this, jesus... last 5 months... pain and bitter disappointment... neither I don't know what to do in this situation...\n\nWe just have to live it through and hope for the best I guess

2	ENFPs and communicating/texting/planning	Hi ENFPs! I‚Äôm an INFP (F, 21) seeing an ENFP (M, 21) and I have a question. \n\nThings are going well between us. We met only 3 weeks ago, but we are moving pretty fast, and have been very open and emotionally honest with each other from the beginning. When we‚Äôre together, it‚Äôs always great, whether we‚Äôre having deep conversations or just watching TV. However, he sucks at texting and planning. He sometimes will send me a text checking in, and then not answer for hours or even until the next day. Somtimes he will ask me to hang out, and then be constantly delaying until we finally get together a couple hours later. He has told me that he‚Äôs better at expressing himself in person than over text. He‚Äôs very busy with work and socializing, so I know that he‚Äôs always distracted. He has also told me that he overcommits himself to activities and people. At the beginning, I was very anxious that he wasn‚Äôt interested, and that‚Äôs why he was bad at keeping in touch with me and keeping up with plans. But as the relationship progresses, he makes it clear that he‚Äôs very interested while we‚Äôre together. But still, when apart, he‚Äôs very distant. We still talk every day, so maybe I‚Äôm overreacting, but I want to understand why he goes MIA for hours at a time.  \n\nCan any ENFPs give insight? Do you think he‚Äôs honestly just busy and doesn‚Äôt care to text when he has things going on? Or should I be worried that he doesn‚Äôt think enough about me to care to answer a text? 
2	I've noticed when things are going 'well' and 'better than expected' sometimes I have taken those people and things for granted.\n\nExample, I'll text someone - have an amazing interaction, feel great about our relationship - then forget to text back until an hour later.  I think it's actually a sign for me that relationship is going well, because I used to get caught up in the moment to moment stuff or what's not going well and focused my energies on that.\n\nBasically, I wouldn't worry about it, but feel free to bring it up with him and be like hey text me back already doofus!  It's not so significant.
1	This is me in a nutshell, when me and my SO of 4 years started dating she said she had the same thoughts, meanwhile I was madly in love with this girl but just sucked at texting and organising plans! \n\nI would say don‚Äôt worry ! He‚Äôs probably keen :)
1	"always distracted" is the thing to remember here. Please don't take it personally. If he's making time for you, even if he's late, he's very interested. 
2	Motivational Monday!	\nToday is a new day! A fresh week! An opportunity start something new and get back into life. \n\nWhat inspires you, /r/ENFP?\n\nPost stories, quotes, and images that give you life. Need a little rally? Don't be shy posting your goals; let /r/ENFP give you a pep talk!\n
8	do ENFP's ask others to make decisions for them?	I know a few ENFP's in real life and I am an ENFP and many of them ask others to make decisions for them. I think we are particularly bad at making decisions and usually we hide it in a "What do you think I should do?" type of question (I do this!!!) but we are really saying "tell me what to do because I don't know what I want" and I think we are actually cheating ourselves of what we really want and then end up feeling trapped later because we never asked ourselves what we want (I do this.) maybe this is just my own experience, but I have a friend who I am sure is an ENFP who was asking me and my other friend what he should do (it was a really important decision) and we were like "ummmm up to you?" and he was saying he was like 40/60 with the decision and I was like "me with every decision" and he laughed, and I was just thinking about this. okay sorry, rant over. thoughts? do you relate?
3	Yes all the time - especially when ordering at a restaurant lol
2	Never had this problem, might ask advice from friends to make sure I see things from different points of view but in the end I have no hard time making any kind of decisions myself.
2	I ask others if im particularly torn on a question, though in order to make sure im not forgeting anything or to see if someone is thinking about it in a new way. Oftentimes others have valuable insights, so i end up feeling more confident in my decision if i agree with them. 
2	I am having issues with an ESFP friend that is doing this exact thing- he's stalling in making a big life decision, and basically forcing the hands of everyone around him to tell him their opinion. Its a really dangerous way to live, I tried to nicely ask if that what he thought he was doing, he proceded to say "oh yes that would be a problem wouldn't it! haha but I am making decisions for myself now, friend B helped me to see that this is the right choice" and I don't know how to tell him that that was what I was talking about. I would hate to see him unhappy with decisions down the line other people made for him :(\n\nComing back to MBTI, I think it may be an ExFP issue, but an ENFP is probably more likely to see the problem since they focus on the future more (stereotyping I know sorry guys). My ESFP friend burys his head and refuses to really talk or think about the future long term, so he's not really able to see the issue like we are, and therefore might struggle to address it.
2	Yes hahahaha 
1	Never had this problem, might ask advice from friends to make sure I see things from different points of view but in the end I have no hard time making any kind of decisions myself.
1	Are you sure they are enfp ? My esfp friend always does that, I might ask opinions for the unimportant stuff like shoe colour but for the important decisions I usually retreat into my shell and won't give any hint or output in the process to others until I come out decided or decide not to decide at all.
1	This is totally me, although I never listen to anyone but myself in the end. I personally have been struggling with gut vs mind decisions in a big transition I am going through. I watched a great personalityhacker enfp video on You Tube. Talked about ‚Äúauthenticity‚Äù as the passenger in 4-person car analogy and we need to listen to that introverted intuition (our core values/‚Äúgut‚Äù) to make a decision where we don‚Äôt feel like we‚Äôre missing something or something is not right. I like to gather evidence/data/other perspectives and then trust my gut (easier said than done though). It does suck to be so slow and sucky (me at least!) at decisions
1	oh yeah I‚Äôm indecisive af on so many levels so yes I do this A LOT haha...sometimes even their decisions help me realize what I want, and maybe that‚Äôs another reason I ask...cuz if I‚Äôm actually not feeling their decision then I‚Äôll know!
1	Oofe, I... I can't tell. Could you pick and then see if we can make it work?
4	Don't know if included or excluded from intj's plans	Hi, I really really feel lonely and sad without a certain INTJ in my life. He was my boss for one and a half years, in research, and a project we developed together wasn't financed. He said he wanted me to stay in his team, but couldn't really give me a perspective. Well, he strangely insisted he wanted me in his team even THOUGH I couldn't see a perspective. Now. I got myself a new job, I work for a research consultancy, and we e-mail almost every fucking day, so I can't really get him out of my head. He's starting as a professor at another university, and he wrote to me that I should think of him every time I pass this particular town where the university is located on my commute to work. For example.\n\nWe've had lots of incidents that made me think he had a crush on me, but, you know, this face, you don't know unless you ask. Didn't want to ask, because - why - we are both married with kids, and I really enjoyed working with him but that's it, you know, no need to go further. But I realized I needed someone like him. He was like this piece of puzzle. I had a great feel out of working with him, because he pushed me to my limits and beyond, but never harsh, always in a relaxed way. And he appreciated working with me, it's so funny, the work certificate he wrote reads like a description of an ENFP by an INTJ, and it's great and all, but he really saw me as a complement, I think. \n\nSo why did I leave? I left because he didn't communicate with me. He contradicted himself, all this complimenting for my work but no perspectives, I thought I went mad. So, I took action, and also consulted him about it. He said: you know that you will do B or C class research there, right? I said: gee, I have no alternative! He said: so, do it. When I left, he started to e-mail me. Do you miss us? Think of me, xyz. Then I heard he had this new position as a professor. \n\nMeanwhile, my new job is good. Demanding, traveling, representing the company abroad, writing recommendations to high-level politicians, all this is somehow great, i actually made a big leap from my old to my new job, but I miss him. I miss him morning, evening, night. I understand what he meant by B and C research, and I know I could do much better with him, concerning quality, of course. At the same time, I took on all this responsibility at my new job. My new boss is great, and he invests in me, creates a trustful relationship and all. I really expected my old boss to offer me a job at the new university, because he gave me all those secretive hints. But he hasn't become more concrete than that until now. And I'm really not sure if I should ask. You know, this face. I have actually made the experience that whenever I became needy, he became cruel. He wasn't a good manager in this regard. My new manager is great at handling my emotions. Which is a relief. \n\nMy old boss asked at my new company to develop a project together, so he somehow is my client for now. This feels great, but we have limited contact, and it's not the same. He also offered me to do a PhD with him, in my spare time, but I don't think this is realistic.\n\nI feel lost. I don't know what to do, if I should ask him whether he wanted to offer me a job or not. I don't know if I should accept it, if yes. But I also suspect him to already having adapted plans (in which I seem to have been involved without ever talking to me about it, so possibly already excluded again). It will definetely hurt me if this is the case. Which probably is. Still - I never had a say in this! \n
1	I don't know but he's giving way too many mixed signals.
8	ENFP and ageing..	I‚Äôm a 26 year old female\nENFP who has seen her personality change drastically over the past few years.  Some of this is definitely due to depression I‚Äôve had over the past years but I feel as if I‚Äôve lost who I was and am wondering if this has happened to other ENFPs - have you felt as you‚Äôve gotten older, the starry eyed way you used to see the world just started to turn grey and colourless?  Did you overcome this? \nAs early as two years ago I used to be the life of the party, constantly surrounded by friends, never felt lonely (even though I‚Äôve always been mostly single - moreso by choice), and had a thousand hobbies and passions and things I was curious about. The world seemed to have endless possibilities and I was also incredibly\nIntrospective, creating Art and feeling as if that inspiration to create good art would never run dry.\n\nNow, I struggle to find inspiration, feel lonely and often feel awkward / annoying in social situations. I used to be able to make friends with literally anyone and now I really struggle with social interactions (especially parties and group hangouts)
6	It sounds like you began to reduce what you were willing to accept from others. This's a good thing.\nI mean sure you made lots of friends everywhere, but were they all healthy for you? And true friends?\nOr did they disappear eventually and not show as much attachment or care as you had with them?\n\nAs for your artistic creative side, what's wrong with you not doing it anymore?\nIt doesn't make you any less of a person that you've stopped.\n\nStop beating yourself up for being more selective with whom you name your friends and have dropped your other pursuits.\n\nListen to what you're silently telling yourself.\nYoure silently telling yourself to slow down and give yourself a different kind of love.\nYoure learning to appreciate silence for longer periods. I hear you that learning to be okay with longer silent periods is a big daunting one for us.\nBut seriously, try to enjoy your own new company. Learning this aspect of your new self will do wonders for your inner contentment and happiness.\n\nRecently I left my job, I was having my third breakdown from depression.\nMy life had become a shell and all I did was work and go way nuts on the weekend with a night out drinking. More drinking than actual truly wonderful friendship moments.\nI barely talked to my family at all and I had no self-respect.\nSince I've left that job I've learnt to appreciate more time to myself and I've begun studying so that I can finally be proud of something in my life and have a new career that I'll actually enjoy.\nSince then I've begun meditation and learning to speak to myself more kindly.\nMy best friends whom I made through not wanting certain behaviours off others and only accepting truly loyal and nice people as my friends I've found a second family.\n\nBelieve in yourself. Even if it seems like you've lost yourself.\nYou've simply stumbled upon your new journey. It's called who am I now?\nNow go explore and only do things that you enjoy, only accept the most wholesome company and remind yourself that it's okay to not be perfect, no one is, you're amazing just the way you. :-D\n\nI'm enfp btw
3	27 year old ENFP here - I have felt the exact same thing. I used to have so many friends/was so excited about life and now I just feel lonely and bored all the time. Not sure how to get back to who I was a few years ago
1	I can identify, around that same age everything was improving until I was crushed by some personal trauma.\n\nI was actually in a disentigrative backslide for 10 years, emotionally.\n\nI suggest finding a community somewhere and get involved.  What made a difference for me was doing the Landmark Forum and getting involved with the community there.  What gave me even bigger gains was joining a separate coaching community called Life on Fire, they have an event called Abundance which is amazing.\n\nThere's Tony Robbins, all kinds of other communities that can superfuel an ENFP.  I suggest you go find one!!  According to the personality research we thrive in these environments where we can help people deal with their hopes, dreams and traumas.
1	I think it's the depression. Once you're able to manage it, you will blossom again. I went through a terrible patch around your age. Years later, with treatment, I've become more clearly myself. I have so much inspiration that I can't keep up with myself. Take care and be gentle! 
1	I think for big-hearted ENFPs, it seems to be important to keep a space open for you to forge ahead without placing other people's suggestion as "more valid" simply because *they* can't do what you do. For me, I can live anywhere and make it work because I hold a deep respect for meagerness as aligning with my core values. Whenever I run into people at higher tiers, they always ALWAYS say that the lack of focus is the main issue in my work...until I drop something they couldn't imagine bringing together because I found the connections. Of course, I didn't 'find' connections so much as they jumped out at me...because my energy and passion comes out of that connectivity and novely. The only reason I could make something good was **because** I went so far.\n\n\n--This is the big issue!--\n\n\nPeople in power are usually there because their own contained sense of self allowed them to forge ahead by making everyone around them look worse by comparison. That would destroy me so much...but then, every once and a while, I catch a glimpse of someone with a strong, giving, *vorcious* Ne in a position of power ... and everyone sees them as rockstars. That's when it hit me that I might be hanging out with a bunch of solitary trees when I'm a slime mold, and they are annoyed that my work is everywhere. It was only when I started creeping up their work without being self destructive that I started feeling that warm excitement for the first time in....half a decade really.\nIf that isn't clear enough, here is a direct answer: If you're in an environment that you can't make your collage of identity in peace, change the workshop. If you can't, leave. I know you can make it work, but you have nothing to prove to anyone. At the end of the battle, you will have spent yourself in a place where nobody was willing to partake.

4	Hello, me
-2	Seriously, what's the point of this post? To feel "relatable"? 
261	Me out of practice in having intellectual conversations with INTJs and the like...	
13	Change the subject material and suddenly the shoe is on the other foot with the INTJ =P\n\nWe INTJs excel at theory but we suck at expressing theory to the outside world, so we keep the theory private and hidden.  It becomes our secret weapon that we are good at and we do not share instead we hoard.\n\nThis same secret weapon we hoard, the ENFPs long for some of the time, and other times they do not care what so ever for it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut there is a symmetry to this for we INTJs crave your extroverted friendliness and how you can put anyone else at ease if you choose to do so.  We INTJs are indifferent to this skill some of the time, while other times it is the thing we crave most in the world and wished we have this talent.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo there is simultaneously this great strength and great weakness we INTJs and ENFPs felt when we interact with each other, depending on the subject matter.  Thus we ENFPs and INTJs pivot and choose a subject matter where we both are kind of mixed-kind-of-strengths where we are semi strong and semi weak in the subject matter and thus we are equals but also we are learning so much when we converse about it.  Instead of picking A or B we pick C for in C we can feel both confident but also continuing growing.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRejoice in the contradictions, rejoice, Yorokobe Shounen (Rejoice Youth) for if there can be no winning, there also can be no losing, and if there is no winning or losing, ***there is only FUN!*** \*\n\n^(* or some other feeling that is mixed, besides fun you can choose despair, frustration, melancholy, and a whole other listed of mixed kind of feelings.  Which feeling you choose is up to you, and thus you should rejoice in this contradiction. üòà)\n\nhttps://xkcd.com/167/\n\nFurther emphasizing my point.

2	oh my word, this is so accurate that it's not even funny XD so I'm not the only ENFP that has a hard time communicating what I'm thinking XD

11	Checks their feelings and values before taking action.
5	One who asks why not in order to understand for the sake of understanding-in-itself, but instead one who asks why to find the ideal combinations, one who asks why in order to better act and do.\n\n(and they never stop...)
5	I wouldn't. A typical ENFP isn't typical.
2	Heavy breathing?
1	Well, if you read the posts and comments on this sub, you‚Äôll get an idea :-)
13	Another shut down	Man, I was hanging out with my best friend (INTJ) of a few years and she said "Oh yea that, I listen, you just talk SOO MUCHH" and it broke my heart.\n\nI've been fairly cautious with her because this tends to happen to every relationship where I get carried away. Growing up my mom constantly told me to calm down and talk less because I was annoying everyone else with my overactive brain. \n\nSo now, I keep it at 50% with everyone until I feel like they want/like more. With this friend, I really thought I had the pacing down, and she aways seems so invested in our conversations, so when she said it, my insides slammed the breaks iland it brought me right back to timeout in the 2nd grade for being too much.\n\nI just needed a vent. Thanks y'all
3	I get this a lot too, but it shouldn't get you down. Literally EVERYONE has an "annoying trait". And in this case it doesn't even seem like she really minds, but just had a hard time to keep up with everything you were saying because it's so much. Especially as an ENFP we gotta dose the things things we share, it's hard but it's reality. Most people just can't keep up. I never realised this about ENFP's until I got one as a best friend. Once he talkes about something he's passionate about, he just won't shut up, goes on for an hour or so and I just lose my focus and concentration. I love him and think he's great and I don't mind him talking so much, but I'm not gonna pretend I listen to every single word he says because I simply can't. I also get carried away sometimes and I really have to scream to my brains to shut the fuck up because I'm spamming too much to people and I should calm the fuck down, lmao. It's hard sometimes especially with people you really like and have a good connection with. But just keep in mind they don't see you any less of a fun person because of that. It's part of you and she accepts it, but she also lets you know if it gets too much. Appreciate her honesty and move on, try to pace it more and you'll be fine eventually so no worries!
2	I had this problem until my early 20s (I‚Äôm now in the 40s), then my gf made me notice that. It hurts to hear that the first time.\nWith some reasoning and enough time, I learned two lessons:\n\n- Be concise, even cynical. Being short and clear helps communicate quickly without resulting boring. On the other hand, you need to be careful of the words you choose, because you might look as smart as asshole, depending on words, listeners and context ;-) People might also ask you to articulate your concepts, that means they‚Äôre really interested in what you‚Äôre saying and you can continue to talk without looking an attention seeker or a boring person.\n- Recognize when someone is not interested in what you‚Äôre saying and stop when you notice it. Not everyone is there to listen only at you, or at the particular topic you‚Äôre talking about.\n\nI think it‚Äôs some kind of respect for others. If you‚Äôll change your behavior, soon or later you‚Äôll notice that people will want to listen at you more than they would as of today.
1	That honestly sounds like something i might say (half) sarcastically, as a joke.  Though i can see how it could come off as insensitive.\n\nI think she was just trying to tease you a bit; she never said she minded it :P\n\nOf course i dont know the context of the conversation before that but yeah.
2	Need help with an INFJ	So I just met this guy who's an INFJ. We talked about a couple of things. It was fun because we shared our viewpoints. But then he's suddenly like, "I don't think you'd like me if we become close friends. I mean, were totally different". But on the other hand, he does want to be friends with me. And he's too shy and talks a lot less. I mean, I really wish we could talk more. Could you provide me with any tips? \n\nThankyou!!
2	i‚Äôd ask him what he means by that.
2	Just talk more with him. If he doesn‚Äôt blow you off then he likes it. I love my ENFP but she def does most of the talking :) - pretty normal. If I don‚Äôt like someone there is no freaking way I am spending time with them FWIW.  Plus we are usually pretty open - just ask questions if you can read him and he will prob just tell you.

3	I too have attention deaf faucets can‚Äôt hear but they can spurt water like crazy, these bad bois can fit so much water and deafness into them. Water we going to do about these prices? They‚Äôre sinking all over the place! Run on over to Deaf Faucets Place today and get your Deaf Faucet on the house! For extra we‚Äôll even put it in the house!
225	The best feeling in the world (Oof)	
9	Maybe i have crippling sociopathy but I dont really care *that* much that someones proud of me. 
10	Or when your crush confides in you that they've never felt as connected to anyone as they do with you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's the tip top.

4	I Love it <3
4	Yeah I did..? How are those two related anyway.
11	Sorry, disagree lol sex is way better
2	I had three of my favorite people do that to me yesterday and oooffff
2	I think it‚Äôs great when people are proud of others. When some one is proud of you, your the reason for them being happy at that moment and that‚Äôs cool.
1	Oh god that is the good shit
1	no one is proud of me :(
9	Why do you guys ‚Äòpush and pull‚Äô when you like someone?	This is something I‚Äôve always asked myself. It hurt in the beginning a lot, but now I‚Äôm just confused; confused if I should even continue trying to pursue relationships with people who decide to walk in and out of my life whenever they wish. It hurts. I‚Äôve got my own trust issues already and it makes me feel like my genuine emotions are being played with whenever I invest in relationships like this.
4	I do that too, but think it has more to do with attachment styles than mbti. To me personally it's often my own insecurities that cause this. I'll be really into someone, shower them with texts and compliments and actions that show I think about them and care. But then even the smallest thing my crush would do that I'd interpret negatively, can throw me off, make me doubt myself, scare me, feeling not good enough for them, etc... Unless I get actual verbal confirmation from them that they are into me and want to be with me, that's when I stop doing the pull and push-crap. I need a lot of reassurance in that area. But once they confirm what they feel for me, I become the most loveable and caring person ever towards you, lmao.\n\nEdit: I'm often pretty comfortable with flirting and this comes easy to me, but once I actually develop real feelings, shit gets scary. I think it's because in that case, there's so much more at stake and so much more to lose. I think I'm very picky who I open myself up to and who I invest emotions in. I pull away too when I think they might not be as invested in me as I am in them, kinda to protect my emotions and myself I guess from disappointment.
5	The best way to get out of confusion mode is to get into action mode.\n\nKeep doing things that light you up, spark joy in you, challenge you.  Hone your ability to be so on top of your shit you don't even have to worry about who likes you and who doesn't.  You just go with the flow.  And flow with the people who want to build alongside you.
3	All types are strong at some forms of synchiroization and weak at other forms of synchiroization.  All humans are good at some things and poor at others.\n\n\n---\n\nI am not sure how much of what your are describing is ENFP in general and how much is the other person is an ENFP but there are other things that influence behavior besides MBTI.  For example life experiences, attachment theory (lots of trust issues are tied to attachment theory), how best you synchiroize for example your 5 preferences with the 5 love languages, so on and so on.\n\nI need more info to be of practical help, but it is also okay for you to not provide more info for I sense you need to feel understood right now.  Someone understanding you and not trying to help you with a solution is its own form of need.  It is okay just to be needed and to understand, to be taken in entirely and to be held entirely.
1	we struggle to live in the middle.. only when you recognize it and work REALLY diligently and patiently to understand and acknowledge why we\ndo that can we grow in that area.   i‚Äôm am ENFP CPA so i am sort of forced to live in a role that is fundamentally ‚Äúin the middle‚Äù and routine for the majority of it. I‚Äôve found some ways of coping and try to apply to other areas of my\nlife but it‚Äôs still a struggle at 35. 
1	Adventure Time Sunday!	\n/r/ENFP! What shenanigans have you been up to this week? Any new adventures planned for the next?\n\nLet's here some stories!
1	**---------Absolute silence-----------**
28	Feeling individualistic to the point where you feel no sense of belonging to any real label, group, circle, identity. Just a dynamic energy moving through time.	Idk if this works in my favor or against it. I feel detached and that can surface in feelings of alienation but also a real sense of freedom and autonomy. Sometimes i look in the mirror or think about my name and they mean very little to nothing to me. Thoughts?
10	Trust me I totally understand your dynamic but there‚Äôs people there for you, they‚Äôre just a little harder to find than most.\n\nIt just makes the connection when you do meet those real friends a whole lot more meaningful and deep.\n\nBut honestly the individualism is a blessing to me atleast, i just feel like a truly unique person and people tend to acknowledge it, which to me is very important as most people tend to conform to a social norm when it‚Äôs a lot more sincere and fulfilling to be yourself, especially when you‚Äôre unique\n\nWe love you.
2	I feel it. Even with my girlfriend I feel detached and not quite there. Like I‚Äôm not really living the live I‚Äôm living. I feel like I‚Äôm just going with the flow. \n\nBut then, sometimes, when I sing with choir, or I‚Äôm with my girlfriend in a low stakes environment (like a library, studying with her), everything feels real. I live for the real moments in my life. When I‚Äôm no longer a passerby, and I actually sit down and live life
2	I went through a phase like that pretty hard at 23. I think it came from just being able to relate to everyone's perspective but also a rejection of getting attached to anything due to not wanting to be vulnerable
1	Not matter what you think about yourself, you fit in exactly how you should. Even if it is by not fitting in. \n\n\nEverything is as it needs to be, in the most literal sense. 
5	Why do people important to me keep walking out of my life? I feel so alone.	One day, we're fine and dandy...the next, they stop responding and never read anything I send them, so I just give up after a few days...I'm not super toxic...at least I don't think I am and I send genuine love and care there way, yet people drop me. I miss them. 
8	We do get lonely. Try to have faith that you'll find a crew that loves and respects you. Some things to consider!   \n\n* We share our big abstract ideas and wild fantasies ‚Äì if someone is sad/unhealthy, it's hard to see the world this way with us. \n* We hop from idea to idea ‚Äì if someone met us during one "phase" but we've moved on, they may not like or understand our new direction/goals\n* Publicly, we avoid negative speech and pad criticism within constructive advice ‚Äì¬†we're not hospitable to ranting that isn't solution focused \n* Similarly, our optimism can be seen as demanding ‚Äì someone who has less faith in the unknown can be turned off\n* We care deeply and create a safe space for people to vent ‚Äì we encourage people to share deep, sometimes dark thoughts. Upon realizing how much of their private life they've revealed, some people retreat and wish they had been less forthcoming \n\n&#x200B;
5	8 billion people on the planet, find the people who actually want you, not the people who pretend to!
2	I feel you. Maybe you're coming off as clingy and annoying even though to you, you're just being you. Try getting distracted by improving yourself and your life. Eventually people will come to you and you wont have to do anything at all but choose who you want to be around. 
2	> Similarly, our optimism can be seen as demanding ‚Äì someone who has less faith in the unknown can be turned off\n\nThis is an interesting point. I need to think about it. Thank you.
2	Don't miss people, Love them. Btw. I know my first comment is a Lil aggressive but it comes from love okay. Love your mind,,,,( not your self ) that crap is a scam on wordplay. Love YOUR mind, body and soul. Your self is the reflection from others. You hear ... "Love others as yourself " or biblical... " Love thy neigbor " ya love others FIRST.  That puts you last so remember that they always save the best for last LOLL. Go with me on this....
1	Are your friends from your outside life or online.....because sis.... Every.single.human.being. I have met from online are bat shid crazy and those friendships end toxic and have made me waste a good 2-3 years of my life. Pure flucking nonsense. If they are natural friends from a healthy environment then it is internally from your end and discretion or judgment on a conscious level....BUT if these friends have genuinely left you hanging as you said it seems to me it is some doings on their end....give it a couple of weeks or a month....if they don't respond or reach out...leave them in zone WHO IS THIS AGAIN?(acquaintance zone that ho3 )
10	I dunno if this is an ENFP thing but...	I hate feeling pressured to fall asleep. I know, intellectually, I‚Äôm down to 4hrs but because I feel like I HAVE to sleep, it makes it way harder to make myself... I wish sleep were optional sometimes cause I‚Äôm probably gonna hate myself tomorrow üò¨ goodnight, maybe.
6	I distract myself by either making up stories or by remembering dreams. That usually helps me forget about the pressure on me to get enough sleep. 
3	If only sleep could be an option. There are too many subjects to study and so little time: quark science, religion and sexuality, specialty cat breeding, my next hiking backpacking excursion. And then there are the projects I SHOULD be doing üòÖüò≠
2	I haaate sleeping. It feels like giving up. I should be sleeping now.
2	ISTJs partners...	Hi there. \n\nENFP newly going out with a (suspected) ISTJ. We are both late 30s for context. \n\nOn the one hand, it's great - he is balanced, practical, kind and sensible in ways I find really attractive. It's not a whirlwind romance, but it is a slow burning, enjoyable, mutually satisfying relationship, which I don't want to end. \n\nMostly. There is one significant issue, which is his introversion is quite extreme, and because he is depressive too, he often cancels on me at the last minute or makes plans and does not keep them, in order to have time by himself. This leaves me feeling like he is not interested, and also as though he is wasting my time. It makes it difficult for me to plan my spare time, which I don't have much of. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI try to give him a lot of space, but it is difficult, he goes much more slowly then I do.  When we are together, it feels like he really does like me, but this other aspect is starting to get me down and wonder about things. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't really have a question, other than, anyone else have similar experiences to this!
3	What questions do you have?  I can explain what is happening but it would be long for our inferior function is full of contradictions, and it is easier instead of explaining the theory to answer questions that you may have.  Questions allow me to be more brief and emphasize the parts you have problems with integrating with your relationship.\n\n=)
2	My dad is an ENFP and my mom is an ISTJ. Long term it just didn't work out. My mom was fine in the relationship (mostly), but my dad needed more connection and attention at the end of the day. My mom wanted WAY more alone time than my dad could handle. They got divorced when I was in my 20s and are really better without each other. \n\nObviously this is one scenario, and two completely different people than you, but it's always made me as an ENFP hesitant to date an ISFJ - I just need someone who can occasionally talk to me about feelings or deeper things. My husband in an INTP, and while he doesn't want to particularly talk about his feelings, he's totally fine talking about them abstractly and hypothetically, haha. So, I can at least talk about my stuff and we have deep interesting conversations. \n\nFor me, dating an introvert isn't a problem, but I need to feel a deeper connection when we are together to feel loved and understood. So "S" guys I've dated were always more problematic whether they were an introvert or extrovert. 
2	I think this match only works under really specific conditions: the ENFP has a demanding/full life and gets the majority (90%) of their emotional fulfillment outside of the relationship. The ISTJ is then a stable/steadfast companion. \n\nNo matter what, the one tip I have...  take the initiative to check in with their feelings, in a non-threatening way. "Hey, can I ask how you feel about xyz?" "What are your thoughts on abc" You won't really re-condition them to be more forthcoming. But, this does prevent conflict and confusion later on. Because they are definitely keeping unhappy thoughts to themselves. \n\nI recently ended a relationship with an ISTJ in his late 30s. I loved him. In attempting to make it work, I thought of every scenario before landing on the one above.
1	I'm an ENFP in my 30s as well, although my boyfriend of 4 years is an INTP, so he needs way more alone time than I do. It can be hard at first. I think the problem might be more due to depression than personality type. Unfortunately, you can't cure his depression...have you talked to him about the canceling plans problem?
1	Hi my dad is also an istj and last year he had some major downs. What I can tell you is:\n\n\- Give him some time\n\n\- Give him Te (steps) advice (but not fluffed with Ne ideas, only when joking) when he is down. Use your idea head to offer easy practical solutions.\n\n\- My dad likes sports. He was hyped to go to the gym together every monday and wednesday. Create a weekly routine he likes.\n\n\- They don't talk about their feelings. \n\n\- Make them smile with sensory stuff (I saw 2 sheeps this afternoon when I was driving. One was black, the second one was grey.) My mom is mostly talking about extroverted sensory, he likes it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe progress is slow, but if you really love him, things will get better and work out.
1	Ennegram types for fellow ENFP	I just recently got into ennegram and I got type 2 with 8 and 3 being a tie for second. For Instinct I got social. \n\nWhat have my fellow ENFP gotten so I can use my extrovertive intuition to find some patterns üòÅ
2	ENFP Enneagram 9v8 2v3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a film maker/artist with an entrepreneurial lifestyle, I can be obsessed with love, peace and harmony, I can also be obsessed with quality results
2	7 or 2. twice i was a 7 with the second highest being a 2. and once i tied. not sure yet which one i am :(
2	7w6, mistyped as 5w4 for the longest time
2	I'm a 2w1. Apparently 7 and 2 are the more common types for ENFP, according to a lot of informal surveys and whatnot.
13	Unable to take compliments	I cannot for the life of me take compliments for some reason. I do art and people telling me how cool it is or how much they like it it just doesn‚Äôt make me feel any satisfaction unless it‚Äôs like one of those unique compliments that occasionally come around. When my gf talks about how much she likes me I definitely take the compliment but sometimes it‚Äôs hard to grasp that someone feels that way or something, I think this is just self-doubt or something. Definitely not an insecure person either, I have a lot of confidence so I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm feeling this way. Maybe it‚Äôs just me being a perfectionist all the time?
8	It's a defense mechanism to keep you from being too intimate from people.  When this happens I suggest you open up about it.  "Man, I hear your words but I can't fully feel what you feel."\n\nIf they pull you closer maybe you can get to the bottom of it.
4	omg i'm the same way and its really annoying because i don't want to come off as rude for not accepting the compliment but i don't agree with it either so i get awkward about it. I totally get the "its hard to grasp someone actually feels that way" cuz i'm a pretty affectionate person but if somebody is as affectionate as i am with me or gives a lot compliments, i feel so weird and i don't know why 
1	I retrained myself to say thanks and smile. Took YEARS to deprogram myself (because really people (and especially women) are taught not to really accept a compliment, but instead that they should humble themselves). Once I got used to it though, now I don't even think twice about it - I also give compliments very freely.
1	ENFP Interviewing ENTP Male Mike Silberstein Ne Fe PC/B(S) FF	
375	Any other ENFPs relate to this?	
38	Why do both ENFPS and INFPS share the same memes? Are we two sides of a coin, and actually every ENFP is an INFP as well? Im confused
13	Totally! üòÇ Either ADHD or slightly isolated, nothing in between

4	Me to a T... Definitely a accurate description. I have never done elicited drugs. So I get from close friends comments that they would love to see what antics I would do, what I would be like high ü§îüòÖüòúü§ô‚úåÔ∏è\nNow on the Budda side, that's accurate as well. I work in a hospital so I either work with some depts all the time and other depts very little. The depts I see only on occasion know me but think I never talk. Someone just last week said to me, "I've known you for 6 years and this is the first I've heard you talk about anything personal. I thought you were a snob." ü§™üò∞
4	We are the most introverted of the extroverts. Or vice versa.
3	Truth.\n\nI also sing made up random nonsensical songs and my wife always follows it up with,\n\n"Mhm...". She doesn't even look up at me when she does it.
3	Yaaaaas!
3	Definitely. I was a theatre kid in high school, and chatted my head off in most of my honors classes or theatre classes. In my regular classes, that were full off bad kids or kids I had nothing in common with, I was silent. I knew all the popular kid drama but had never spoken a word to them. Of course they also never spoke a word to me, but I sat near them and they loved to brag and tell stories to each other, lol. 
3	Why are you guys always spying on me and making tweets about me.
2	I would say ENFPs are actually introverted extroverts rather than extroverted introverts (and yes I think there‚Äôs a difference)
4	(INFP) I've said it before and I'll say it again. I'm pretty sure you all are just INFPs who need less alone time. 
3	HEy eVErYboDy i'M An ONFP
1	Me to a T.
1	Yehp that‚Äôs me alright
1	So basically an introvert.
1	Me
1	It is usually when the other person stops replying and I'm thinking, "just shut up now". \n\nI once had a person refer to me negatively as an irritating stream of consciousness. They didn't think I could hear them. Stuff like that leaves a mark and makes a big difference.
1	me omfg
3	Best ENFP movies?	Which really should be movies with the best beginning 20 minutes since that‚Äôs probably all we had the patience to watch.. but still say it was SUCH a good movie!
3	For me Little Women is my favorite ENFP movie - I just relate to Jo March so hard, particularly that scene where she is talking (I think) to her mom about how she just can't be content because she just needs to go do things. 
2	For attention span purposes... the movie ‚ÄúUP!‚Äù The opening montage is absolutely beautiful. But, be prepared to cry. üòä 
1	Basketball Diaries
1	Bridesmaids and Easy A.Relatable characters,you'll love them 
1	Hey :D\nI guess something mind challenging like Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind or Memento (they have a similar screenplay writing style!).\nAnd maybe Carnage, for the awesome social interactions.\n\nLet me know!
1	Sweet November\n\nYou think Keanu is the ENFP, and then you realize it‚Äôs Charlize :) 
4	What are some ways you've improved yourself?(RANT)What are some resources you've used to educate yourself on becoming a great (ENFP)?	I'm sick of the 'oh totally me I'm so relatable' posts. We get it, you're here cause you're the same or you know someone who is the same. But AS AN ENFP GOSH DARNIT, I can make all of those things relatable too, and I know how much we like validation (*shakes wooden spoon*). \n\nBUT, there has to be more to this. I think there's positivity to be gained here. I think there are ways of improving the downsides to your personality type. It will be maintenance just like your job is maintenance for you to eat and sleep comfortably. You're maintaining your life. So maintain your brains too damnit. \n\nWhat are some ways in which you've improved yourself? What have you learned lately that you'd like to share about? What are struggles for you (general, not specific), that you see recurring in your life but are not working on improving? \n\nAnswer any questions you like. I believe that one of my biggest flaws is making decisions. I can't see any reason why you ENFP's would be different. What about anxiety? Is that relatable? The thing is, we can be ENFPs but we don't have to restrict ourselves to a negative trait associated with 4 letters. There are books on what I'm ranting about aren't there? \n\nLet's strive as a community to improve our lives the best we can, and to share what we've learned in a little more of a selfless way. Talk about your observations, and use your "stories" as good proof of what your topic is. But try not to make your post just to be 'relatable', more so implicating observations of growth potential, or something else. You can share your 'negative' stories with a brief comment on how you've learned from the experience you felt negative emotions towards.\n\nLet's do this guys!
3	Well first of all, I think it's bullshit honestly how anxiety, depression, adhd,... Keeps getting posted as "is there a correlation between this and being ENFP?". There is 0 evidence suggesting that and not a single type has any kind of description that links mental health issues so I think if you got them, it's purely personal and totally unrelated to mbti. Depression and anxiety and such aren't part of a personality, they're a mental illness so yeah.\n\nAnyways, some things I worked on:\n\n- Jealousy/posessiveness over loved ones: This used to be very strong when I was a teenager, I didn't really like many people but the precious few I did care about, were MINE. I hated if they got new friends, I hated feeling second place, I wanted to be a priority. It was just my ego acting up or whatever else it was. Took me years to overcome this, took me a lot of insightful conversations with my best friends to be fully aware of this so I could finally change. They assured me that I stay important to them no matter what and it just took time to actually believe this so now I don't feel bothered by my friends having other friends (or a life in general, lol) besides me. I encourage them even because I see how it makes them happier.\n- Dramaqueen: I used to start shit on purpose, especially online since that's easier and doesn't affect your real life. I was pretty horrible. I only went after "bad people", but still the things I said and did were very cruel. It gave me a feeling of superiority. At the time I was very depressed and felt like I had 0 control over my life, so I think that "helped" me to get some power and control again. But as I started to feel better about myself, the need for this just disappeared. I realised how I hurt people and lowered myself to their level and that I was no better than them. I wasn't "serving" justice, I was a plain bitch. \n- Settling for less: I was desperate for attention, love, touching,... This resulted in me being a hoe at first, sleeping around, fwb, one night stands, etc... Then I was done with that because it felt wrong and I started dating around, which wasn't much better. I settled for any guy, shitty relationships, drama, unhappiness,... My last ex was emotionally abusive and that's when it hit me that I was fucking myself over by being with random guys I barely knew. They treated me great for the first month or two but people can't hide their true selves too long. So now after fucking/dating around for years, I finally put a stop to that. Been single for a year and haven't slept with people much. I did with one friend but thought there was something more and again with another friend but that was purely fwb and that ended after 2 weeks and after that we decided to never do it again because it was just "ugh", idk. I also told him I wanted something real, I was done with meaningless sex and he understood that. I've been single for a year and haven't slept with anyone in about 7 months. Was a very hard change at first, but now I'm happy and don't crave sexual or emotional intimacy anymore. I will take my time with the next guy to find out if I'd really wanna be with him and also withold sex for a while until I'm certain he likes me for who I am.\n- Becoming a better friend: As mentioned before, I could be jealous and such. But also in general, I don't think I was a great friend. I'd easily get upset over things, blame things on them, test them in some ways, ... I just woke up one day thinking that I had to change that after all the great things my friends have done for me. It took a lot of conscious actions and talking though, it wasn't easy. I would try to not reply on certain things right away that made me emotional, but instead take some time to think about it and let it sink in. This way my responses were less emotional and overwhelming and more focused and collected. I also paid a lot of attention to what I do, and if I did upset a friend, I'd try my best to reconcile with them as peaceful as possible. Basically toning down my emotions, not allow them to control me every time something upsets me but learn to see things the way they really are and not in the exaggerated way my brain tries to show me. It's all relative.\n- Decision making: I don't really make clear decisions if it's not needed. I just see how life goes, and when I reach a certain point I know I'll take the decision that feels right in that moment. I rarely plan ahead a lot, I do dream and such but it's never fixed. It can always change due to circumstances or just how I feel, so I never worry about it.\n\nSome things I don't think I'll be able to change is that every now and then, I will have an emotional meltdown. This usually happens when a lot of drama goes on in my life (or of loved ones) and I just can't take it anymore because it's too much. I'm also a Cancer, no idea if you guys believe in that but the Cancer description fits me perfectly. It's also the most emotional Zodiac so add that to being ENFP and you get me, haha. I'll always be an intense feeler and sometimes it will control me, but I'm okay with that. I'm usually able to not let it get too far, I try to not take it out on anyone and instead isolate myself for a while until I feel better again.
1	>I believe that one of my biggest flaws is making decisions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've found the best way to deal with this is to just \*make a decision\* then stick to it.  The bigger and the more 'in alignment' your decision links to your values and true goals the stronger.  It sounds simple and it is.  The trick is continuing to develop this as a practice so you keep playing so full out, nobody and no circumstance can stop you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe more you go after what you really want - the more you discover it's all attainable and in fact that's how you get over the hump of indecision, by being energized and going for it!
4	Are there mbti relationship chat groups i could join?	I'm an enfp female with a crush on an intj male. \nAs much as I think turning to the internet wouldn't be as good as just finding out from that intj crush himself, my purpose in this isn't to just get advice from people but also because I want to learn and hear about other people's experiences with their crushes, whether currently and in the past. \n\nThe enfp/intj pairing is really commonplace but is there any chatroom I can join for that? 
2	Click on r/ENFP and you can find a link to be invited to Discord in one of the posts. It's an app. It's really cool and you can talk about musics, venting and so much more :) 
1	I wouldn't mind this sort of discord except a part where we can also meet people... :D
14	Anyone else have the feeling that no one truly understands them?	Hello fellow ENFP‚Äôs! I‚Äôm new here and this is my first post! Let me start by saying I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôve found this subreddit. I get a great laugh and read relatable posts every single day.\n\nAnyways, back to the point... I feel like no one really understands me as a person, not even my close friends, parents, siblings, anyone. I feel like there‚Äôs a depth to myself that hasn‚Äôt been discovered my anyone else mainly because of my external ENFP (silly) attitude. I feel like people just see me at the surface level and they kind of blow me off because of it. Lately though, I‚Äôve been sharing my thoughts on certain topics I am really educated in/passionate about and have noticed people start to listen so that‚Äôs encouraging. I just wanted to know if any of you felt the same way.\n\nCheers!
5	Ah yes I relate\n\nMany people think that I don't have problems just bc I almost never show any sign of negative emotions\n\nAnd they think that I share everything about my life but really the most I would share would be about what I ate for lunch, about the bird I saw today or about anything around me really; I never actually share about anything important to me and people assume that I just don't have important matters which gets really frustration sometimes \n\nAnd of course when people say 'you won't understand, you're too happy for your own good'\n\n*Sighs*
5	Yeah I think it's a common thing to feel like you are not heard or known.\n\nIt's healthy to push the boundaries, likewise the better listener you become the better other people will come to know you.\n\nNever be afraid to express yourself and see what you might discover.
2	YES YES YES! I am ENFP and people do not understand that I can be actually "into" some things? People do not understand why I feel the way I feel. I mean, even explaining to them is exhausting (and a little embarrassing to me personally). Moreover, people just take me for someone who is always wrong and immature and NEVER try and listen and understand me! I totally get you! I thought, I was the only one. 
2	Yeah this is my pretty uninformed opinion but I feel like your whole personality type can just be like a defensive "front" for deep pain in its extremes. Maybe it's too scary to be quiet, still, and serious because you would confront whatever reality you want to avoid about your life. That can make you feel lonely. \n\nAlthough you're really fun to party with ;D
1	The thing is it's not only others who can't understand me, sometimes I also can't understand myself. I'm grey in the world of black and white. 
1	I felt that really heavily about this time last year because i never chose to share my mental health issues with the people i loved so i made a massive effort to be more vulnerable to them and several dark spirals later i still feel like they don‚Äôt know me! but instead now it‚Äôs because i‚Äôm scared that all they see me for is this big emotional baby
37	Why are we so extreme?	Does anyone feel like they are super extreme all the time? You‚Äôre either super outgoing, or super shy. You either love something, or you hate it! You are either having the best day ever, or the worst day ever. You are either high or low. There is no in between. Why is it like that? Why are we like that? It makes me feel super over dramatic, and I feel like it makes people look at us like we are children. Why are we so extreme? \n\n\nThese are the thought that keep me up at night.
21	We feel everything extremely deeply b/c we are extremely empathetic. Everything is personal to us, lol. We love hard, we defend hard, we play hard, we work hard, but we also procrastinate hard, lounge hard, deny hard etc. 
10	Had this more as a teen and in my early 20's. Now I mellowed down, I do get highs and lows now and then but generally I'm just a cheerful, calm person. I used to be called hyper and stuff, but not anymore. People still perceive me as a fun and charismatic person but without the extreme hyper stuff, haha. I like it more this way, it's so tiring to have extreme intense emotions. 
6	BC the middle seems boring. There's no story if you're "fine"
3	I'm like this too, as an INFJ. In terms of mood (either high or low), in terms of motivation (either fully there or not there at all), in terms of appearance (feel like I'm either really ugly or really pretty), in terms of confidence (either there or not there at all), in terms of work (I either write a good essay or not write one at all)...anddd loads of other things, but point is, it's always really high or really low. \n\nI know people might disagree with what I'm about to say, but...I think this is the right way to live. Being in between high and low is boring. The essence of life is feeling. We should appreciate being able to feel life so deeply, in everything that we do. 
3	Hahahahah my ENTJ bf told me that ‚ÄúI never have middle ground‚Äù lmao
2	I think we're just playful by nature, and so can INFJ's that's why we get along.\n\nSometimes I'm in "Dad" mode and sometimes I'm in "kid mode"
69	Do you guys ever have those moments where your introvertedness and extrovertedness are having an internal battle?	Like when one part of you wants to go out with friends but the other just wants stay at home and work on my hobbies or something
17	Yup definitely. I want to go out with friends and have fun but also just wanna stay home and study/ draw
4	If you're in one of these moments, do not complicate the situation with alcohol...
3	Yup. Sometimes I'm peopled out and can't do anyone new.
2	Me: thinking of cool addition to converstation\nAlso me to myself: do i really care?
1	All the time
1	ALL DAY
1	ALL THE DAMN TIME
1	I had this 10 minutes ago and I know I will have this like in 10 minutes again 
1	YES! I thought I was weird! \n\nUsually comes down to if I'm invited out I'll go, otherwise I'll stay home and do music or video games online. 
1	I, too am human
1	Definitely. Happens in pretty much every conversation 
1	Are u me? This is mr literally all the time. 
1	When I am out with my friends, I want to go home. When I cancel plans and stay home, I regret it. 
1	This generally happens for me when I've spent a lot of time out with friends lately but not a lot of time doing "me time". I'm invited out *almost* every day, and its hard to turn down. Then I look and see that I have plans each day for the next week and that tonight might be my only time for some alone time for a while. I face this problem today actually, lol. 
0	This has to be the most asked question here
2	ENFP Career	Hello, fellow ENFP here! I'm in high school and having a huge struggle to find what I want to do for the rest of my life. I know ENFP's always have struggles with a career because they want to do anything, but I think I want to become an orthodontist. I feel like I could be a volunteer firefighter on the side and I could teach dentistry because I know how fulfilling those two are for ENFP's. Unlike other ENFP's, though, I'm a math and chemistry person and I've always been urged in a career where I can take advantage of my abilities. Any thoughts from ENFP's?\n
1	Medical field! Religion based career. Entrepreneur just be a mature ENFP with developed organizational skills or find a INTJ for a partner to keep you motivated.
1	I'm in HS too! I struggled for a year or so because I couldn't decide between going into a medical field (pediatrics because I love working with kids), or choosing something more creative, like an artist of some sort. I've decided to become a wildlife veterinarian! I'd be able to work with kids and animals, and always be surrounded by nature. I've been good at science my whole life, and this is the way to take advantage of it!\n\nI think that you shouldn't stress over this too much. Just think about things you love, and figure out a way you can do that in a career. I think you'd be a great orthodontist! And I definitely think that you can do firefighting on the side - my old Earth Science teacher from middle school was a volunteer, and he said he loved doing 2 jobs like that. 
1	I am a teacher. I would personally suggest you to be a counsellor or something that is creative and actively helps mankind? I might be wrong but I think ENFPs are just this way? IDK. This would be my suggestion based on personal experience.   \n\n\n  \nP.s. ORTHODONTIST! FIREFIGHTER!!! AWESOME! THIS IS SUPER AWESOME! :D
1	I suggest going for your biggest dream.\n\nNever sell yourself short.\n\nGo big.  You're an ENFP.  You can do it!
4	ENFP - - > ADHD?	It appears to me there are quite a few correlations between ENFPs and ADHD; bored easily, scattered, quite restless at times. Not to get personal, but is anyone who is an ENFP also have ADHD? 
5	Me and my other ENFP friend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nADHD can obviously be any type (I know one ISTJ ADHD autistic woman), but I think that ENFP is this kind of type that just, uh, matches ADHD? Or perhaps "enhance already existing traits" is a better description?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have Ne, so basically many abstract ideas at once, it goes "perfectly" with this sort of constant thought train of ADHD ppl. Inferior Si, therefore weak focus on material world, your own health (so many forgotten meals...), unreliable memory etc.\n\nFi-Te are fun combo. Basically hyperinterest-hyperfocus combo. When ADHD person finds this one passion, or finds someone important to them, then it's possible for them to go and finally focus on doing something and get that sweet sweet dopamine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is not a type that is destined for any neurotype. It technically matches certain description, but never think ENFP = ADHD.  ENFP ppl may have tendencies similar to ADHD ppl, but neurotypical ENFP still differs from ADHD ENFP in terms of severity of certain behaviors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor example, HEALTHY neurotypical ENFP doesn't have executive dysfunction, therefore it may be easier for them to fight with their lack of focus or organization.
3	Yes, I am ADHD, and test as ENFP.  \n\nI'm super-curious about how my MBTI test would come out, if the ADHD factors were controlled for.  I feel like I identify as ENFP _because_ I have ADHD-PI.\n\nMy ADHD symptoms include:\n\n* restlessness/impatience/boredom/attention seeking, \n\n* trouble finishing projects, \n\n* scattered thinking, messy, disorganised, frequently running late, and trouble planning ahead,\n\n* forgetful, \n\n* impulsive decisions, trouble managing finances, blurting out inappropriate things, \n\n* emotional lability,  \n\n* clumsiness, trouble concentrating, easily distracted.\n\nThere ain't a lot of research yet (sigh).  And of course, not all ADHD people are ENFP.  If the respondents to [this thread](https://healthunlocked.com/adult-adhd/posts/137748487/adhd-and-myers-briggs) are typical, it seems that most  ADHD people would be xNFP/xNTP with a few  xNFJs.\n
2	I thought I had ADHD in my 20s so I tried an Adderall for the first (and last) time. When the effects started, I was at the gym & suddenly felt like Daredevil (minus the blindness). I swear I could hear individual conversations & was in some weird tunnel. It felt like it also muted some of my other senses & thoughts.\nWe probably shouldn't fight our true selves. 
1	I am 
1	Any type can be ADHD.\n\nFurthermore ADHD is not just an attention problem with more than 2/3rds of ADHD people, having self regulation / executive function problems for EF brain networks have many purposes one of the big purposes is the self regulation of attention like where the eyes go, inhibition, activation, motivation, modulating attention / effort / motivation and set shifting all of theses, yadda, yadda yadda more technical terms.  Well what I am saying here there are many types of ADHD and ADHD without EF problems looks different than ADHD with EF / Self Regulation problems.\n\nBut yeah some ADHD people are also ENFPs.\n
1	Yes!!!!! I have ADHD and I have never found anything more fitting than discovering the ENFP personality type. I feel like I belong finally 
4	For any of the Drag Race fans, does anyone think ______ is an ENFP? (Spoilers)	Soju!!\nI was getting heavy ENFP vibes from her with her silliness in her lip sync and positivity after getting the boot. And the way she completely overshared to the judges about the cyst on her taint popping, but also in such an endearing and iconic way. Idk maybe I'm crazy and just think she's cute and admire her.
1	I could definitely see that!\n\nI wish we were able to see more of her ;_____;\n\nShe was in my top 2 along with Yvie Oddly. The quirky queens are always my favorites\n\n(And, god, the cyst lmao)
1	ENFP Interviewing INTJ Male Jin Shergill BP/S(C) MM	
3	Being talked over	Hey so I‚Äôm a strong ENFP. I feel like I‚Äôm pretty outgoing, friendly and social in general but I feel like in big groups I don‚Äôt know super well I either keep pretty quiet or get talked over a lot. Like this past week I just started an internship out of state and didn‚Äôt know anyone. I met all the other interns one on one and talk to any of them when we‚Äôre in small groups but whenever we all get together I feel like I don‚Äôt really talk much, get more reserved and get talked over a lot. Anyone else have similar experiences?
2	I know what you're talking about - speaking and listening in groups is a skill to be developed just like any other skill.\n\nI know it must feel strange if you consider your self great in 1 on 1's but have trouble with groups.\n\nI suspect it has something to do with wanting to look good to EVERYONE and you can't trust yourself to look good if you're visible in a group, so we try to quiet ourselves down or sabotage our listening by overthinking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou just gotta do it.  Give yourself permission to be powerful.  To be heard.  The people speaking over you do it - why can't you?  Speak in groups as a practice.  Reveal yourself in groups as a practice.  Get that people may judge you - that's fine - they're judging you whether you speak or not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had a friend once tell me I was the "outsider" and the "quiet one" and I thought to myself "I'm quiet because you talk over everyone all the god damn time!"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly you can take Toastmasters or plan parties, events etc..  Do things or leadership curriculums that put you in a leadership position where you have to work with teams or lead teams.  It is a skill you can develop.
1	I find it helpful to remember that female input tends to be interrupted/ignored/dismissed in mixed-sex work meetings ([https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42253091](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42253091).   \n\nIt's helpful, because I understand that it's nothing personal, and it's not any reflection on me or my ideas.  It's just unconscious biases at play.  \n\nI take responsibility for putting extra effort in to make sure I am heard sufficiently - by saying things like ""ummm, yeah, if I could just finish what I was saying there, ....", "I'm not quite sure I explained myself well there, can I try again?" \n\nI have tried being bolshy and pushy, but have found that just gets people offside, so now I try an approach that seems to be asking permission.  I always get permission, and people are more focussed.  yay.
1	I can totally empathise.... 
1	Unbelievable. I am frequently frustrated by being talked over and I am a good public speaker, not shy, not overly quiet, I articulate and organize my speech well. I‚Äôm frequently complimented on the way I explain describe things.. BUT PEOPLE SOMEHOW ALWAYS SPEAK OVER ME!! In an important meeting amongst colleagues once I legit slammed my hand on the table and yelled at one woman to please let me finish a sentence! It wasn‚Äôt even a man doing it 
1	ENFP dating another ENFP that seems to have lost interest. How to fix this?	While traveling through Scotland I met an amazing ENFP Scottish guy. We hit it off immediately. By the end of our first date he invited me to the Canary Islands with him and his friends. Being an ENFP myself, I said yes. We had a blast together and we agreed to see each other a month later. When we met up he seemed distant and just not into our relationship anymore. We went to dinner with some of my friends and they said he obviously really liked me but something was very different. When I asked him he said it was the fact I was going back to the US. I plan to be back in Europe in a month so not sure what‚Äôs changed. I‚Äôve been guilty of meeting someone and being obsessed for a month or two then losing interest. I suspect that‚Äôs what has happened. It‚Äôs just this is the first time I‚Äôve had the tables turned on me. Thing is, I still really like him. How do I turn this back around and get his interest again? 
2	Have you had seriously talks about what you're both looking for?  Fun and adventure?  A lifelong partner?
3	Are we know-it-alls or simply passionate?	So whenever something is being discussed that actually interests me, I get carried away. I'll strongly voice my opinion and say what I think about other opinions. I stay respectful though, I'm not completely gonna bash on it, curse, talk shit,... I just say what I think because I have basically no filter in such matters.\n\nOften people, both strangers and friends, tell me I just "want to be right", that I "know best" and that I'm a know-it-all basically or try to be. This bothered me for a long time. Every time this happens I literally tell them that I don't think my opinion is the ONLY opinion that matters and I certainly don't think I'm right. Often, in debates or discussions there is no right or wrong to begin with, just people's opinions so I don't get why I can't just say what I think without being perceived as trying to be right since I don't believe in that to begin with it. Nobody is right, we all just have our own thoughts and views on things. Often I'll get criticised about it, that I should back down and keep my mouth shut or just stop talking. That really hurts.\n\nBut it got me thinking why I am like that and a few days ago, I read in some ENFP comments on some other post something about ENFP's being very passionate and that passion being mistaken for being a know-it-all. And suddenly everything made sense to me. Passion is exactly what I'd use to describe the feeling I have when I discuss things. I often thought I had no passion because like most ENFP's apparently, I can't stick to 1 hobby or interest or even major. I thought I lacked passion overall. But when it was put like that, I realised I do have passion. It's just not focused on a few things like it does with most people and isn't as strictly defined the way it is. I just have passion when it comes to thinking about how the world works, how people think, finding out why other people think the way they do,... That has always fascinated me. Maybe I'm just rambling on, but can anyone relate?
3	Yeah, when I discuss "things" i'm using my Ne. If something pops into my brain and it makes sense I'll state it and kindof wait for feedback to see if other people think its true or not. However, I'll say it with enough confidence that people think that I'm espousing my beliefs or things I think are truths. Its just not, I'm just talking here and having fun. \n\nBut plenty of other types don't share unless they are confident that they're not wrong. I'm not concerned with being wrong. Im good at pointing out ways others might be wrong, and it might come across as I'm trying to make some overarching point with my criticism... but I'm not lol. \n\nI like your ideas of what you're passionate about. I find that I'm passionate about whatever I'm doing at any given moment, but sometimes with more intensity than others. I throw myself 100% into whatever it is, and it might be something completely different the next week. I think other people live more "in time" than we do, they feel the need to be consistent day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month, year-to-year. To them living is establishing who you are and doing it indefinitely. For us living is experiencing a whole lot of life, and that is going to mean constantly learning and changing. We use those experiences to shape our understanding of how the world really is. 
1	I relate, and I understand why this occurs, for most of your post is about the Te function in an ENFP and having Te in the Tertiary slot means you ***FEEL*** your Te differently than an ExTJ who has Te in the leading spot, or an IxTJ in the Auxiliary slot, or an IxFP who has Te in the Inferior slot, and so on.\n\nHaving Te in the tetriary slot changes your relationship of Te in so many ways.  Socionics goes alot into this and I am not going to explain all the systematic insights of knowing where your 8 functions are in the 8 slots, but here are a couple in order to be brief.\n\n* You feel confident with Te, even though you are not as strong at Te compared to Ne and Fi.  Yet at the same time with an ENFP you are confident with your Te internally.  Yet how other people see your your Te, they see it as bold and intense, when seen by others.\n\n* Your Te is stubborn and uncompromising once you have understand a solution to a problem, sure you will hear people out and will always continue to learn, but you do not forget the things you already know and understand and they are imprinted onto you.\n\n* Te in the 3rd slot has a drive to "know things" and to put this knowledge "into action."  It is different than Te in the 1st slot^(ExTJs) which thinks more globally with their Te how can this knowledge be transformative towards society as a universal thing, society needs more hammers for hammers allow society to change in these ways. Or Te in the 2nd slot^(IxTJs) which have Te that is more contextually with the situation sometimes you use your Te as a hammer but sometimes you need a different Te for a scalpel should apply.  Having Te in the 3rd slot allows you to use your knowledge in a very conservative and prudent way, but when the situation seems familiar there is a rise to action and you feel confident for you have that magic knowledge, that magic hammer already in your hand and you want to use it.  It is like having a hammer in one of your hands and no one seems to realize this hammer may be useful to solve the problem at hand so you use your other hand to eagerly raise your hand to get attention so you can point to the hammer and say we should use this.\n\n* Simultaneously having Te in the 3rd slot means your knowledge is situational and thus if it does not apply you are more meek and listening, taking in information, absorbing, imagining the dozens of solutions that may apply with the knowledge you have in your mind.  When you do not have the right tools you do not use Te and shift to Ne.  You are problem solving till you have the right solution, but when you have the right solution you want to be bold and activate towards solving the problem.\n\nThat is enough for now for I am trying to be more brief in my posts.  \^_\^  I answered the main things but yeah I can understand =)
1	We can make assumptions as if they are 'known' or 'true' for everyone, probably because we're often speaking from our values.\n\nI find it more fair to speak in a way that people know I'm speaking from MY POINT OF VIEW and not hard set reality.  "For me, I could never do that because I don't think it's right."  "I can see why that might not be for you.  But I totally love it."\n\nIt gives people the freedom to interact with me and we can work from our different points of view.
1	I think I am more passionate than a know-it-all. It‚Äôs the passion that fires me up to learn more about a topic/place/person... how much I retain is a different subject altogether though. üòä
3	How do you keep your hyperness / loudness under control?	I‚Äôm fine in one on one settings usually, but I think when I‚Äôm in a group of people in a public setting I get way too excited and freak out?? 
4	You have to be extremely conscious of yourself. When someone talks, focus on what they are saying and listen without interrupting. I also ask many questions to people, also the quiet people so everyone gets a chance to be heard. You gotta realise it's not all about what you have to say, but to try and distribute the attention evenly. 
1	I don't.\nAnd I don't care.
15	Is it an ENFP thing to get bored of people and things easily?	I recently discovered I‚Äôm an ENFP and I need to know more about whether this particular thing I‚Äôm struggling with is a trait. I get bored and frustrated really easily. One moment I‚Äôll say I have a crush then the next day I flip and say ‚ÄúNot feeling it.‚Äù I sometimes don‚Äôt know what I feel any given day or how I‚Äôm gonna wake up. Will I be consistent in my emotions? It‚Äôs annoying to me and the people around me. Help, anybody?
6	I'm not exactly sure if it's an enfp trait but yea I'm an enfp too and I feel you \n\nOne moment in extremely excited about something and after a while I go ,'nah it's boring I'll drop it' and it really is a cause of frustration for me too bc I end up never getting anything done
3	I think it might be a ENFP trait. Personally, I tend to become very intense when it comes to any kind of relationship. I will focus very hard on a person, trying to learn about them as much as possible and seeing if they can bring me any thing (knowldege I mean). In general, relationships are about exchanges. Since we are constantly evolving, we need to be kept stimulated or we will get bored. \n\nMaybe it's ADHD... 
2	This is totally an ENFP thing. Have you read the Heidi Priebe book? You need to! It was very eye opening and validating!
1	Both, imo. 
1	Holy cow. Yes yes yes. I will be so enthusiastic and invested until suddenly..  I‚Äôm not.
9	To fellow ENFPs: Do people tell you that you are too positive?	ENFP female here, sometimes people tell me that I'm too optimistic, too positive and I never seem to have a single problem in my life. \n\nOf course, like any other human being, I do have my own problems and worries. However, I dont really like to show that in worrying about anything; I don't want to worry my friends and I feel like it's something I can deal with in my own. \n\nI've always had an incredibly optimistic mindset; there's nothing I've ever thought of as only bad, there's always a brighter side to every worst case scenario to me.\n\nIs this something an ENFP does? Even with ENFP aside, does anyone do this too?
8	It's called having the decency to not dump our negativity onto others.  It can eat us up inside if we don't have an outlet, but a healthy minded ENFP sees the bleakness in situations but strives to rise above to take a more positive path.
7	Ppl: " Life isn't rainbows and skittles you know."\nMe: thanks ? *followed by internal screaming*
3	As an ENFP, I think any good or bad experience is still an experience that I will cherish for the rest of my days because I will have learn something from it, even if it is painful. Perhaps that explains ENFPs' optimistic mindset. 
1	Always
1	Yeah, I think its common because overall we enjoy life and living and its pretty hard to put us into situations that are really too much for us to cope with. \n\nHowever, we do need to acknowledge our shit too. So just make sure that you do have people that are willing to listen and be supportive on the days where problems flare up. I didn't open up to a lot of people in my life and I hid my problems from them (and myself), ended poorly. \n\nSometimes all you need is someone to listen to you. 
1	People have defensive mechanisms to deal with reality (or their perception of it), like being realistic or negative - they are just natural strategies we have for dealing with situations.\n\nI can't speak for all ENFP's but I'm naturally optimistic at almost all times and nothing can bring me down.\n\nIf I'm letting someone's negative energy rub off on me I remind myself that's THEM, I aknowledge their point of view and do and say what serves me best, optimistic, realistic, or whatever.
1	I relate to this so much. People think you‚Äôre irrational or blind or unrealistic. When actually, you see the big picture just as much as they do but have consciously decided to take a positive approach to the situation. \n\nFurther to that, I also resonate with the idea that we don‚Äôt just walk around dumping negativity on people and walk around complaining. I don‚Äôt see why we should do that when there‚Äôs so much to be happy about, and so much to look forward to in our rich lives. The interesting thing is that we can be going through the worst experiences and still have this happy outer layer. \n\nSo I think there needs to be a balance for us where our default optimistic state doesn‚Äôt prevent us from expressing some of the struggles that we go through in a healthy way with trusted people. 
1	Yes. Always. Optimistic, nice, positive
99	We are comfortable and people feel great around us quickly, don't forget that!	Today I went to a recuting/career matching agency and the first thing my agent told me, within seconds of talking for the first time was that I had a great smile and that she was feeling a little nervous when she first saw me,  but from the first word I spoke with such a genuine smile she felt super comfortable, and it made my day, cause I wasn't even trying! üòÑ I was a little nervous too, but apperantly I unconsciously was just giving this good friendly vibe!\n\nWe had a great honest conversation, and it was great to listen her give me compliments you wouldn't usually hear, like how it seemed I was a very happy joyful person, that it seemed I could get friends easily and how she was surprised I didn't have a girlfriend yet. \n\nIt really helped me feel more confident about myself, knowing that I can create this great atmosphere makes me feel less shy about just going up and talking to anyone, cause sometimes I really want to, but don't want to bother the other person or come off as weird or awkward, but because of how we are that ain't happening, we have the amazing power to make people's lives happier so we shouldnt put breaks on ourselves! üòÑ\nMuch love
20	Very much true, great reminder! We shouldn't forget about our strengths, and being sociable and likeable is still a huge advantage :) 
20	Yea it is strane how quickly people trust me. I have had people tell\nme their life stories to such painful detail that even they themselves were surprised having done that, 4 hours after we met...
19	Sometimes this sub is really negative, only complaining about the bad stuff about ENFPs. But I love being an ENFP because we CARE about people. Yes, this does have its downsides, but I think it is the reason for our existence - to care about one another. 
3	I'm the kind of ENFP who becomes someone else (shy and easily intimidated) when I'm around new people, but still trying to say something funny and entertaining. I don't really become the real ENFP who is enthusiastic and talkative when I'm on interview. Especially around my superior at the early stage. \n\nBut yeah, when I'm around people who I already know they would vibe well with me, I would talk so easily with them and my friend usually asks me if the other person and me have been friends for so long when we've only met a few times. 
9	Share your ENFP INTJ lovestory?	So, I am in love with this INTJ guy and I feel for him like I never felt before. I am so sure that if we end up together,we will be good. I always had my doubts before this. Anyway, I am a typical ENFP, if there is such a thing, and he is a typical INTJ. We love each other. Tell me your ENFP INTJ love story and who took the first step and when?  Are you each other's Happily Ever After? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
3	I‚Äôm an ENFP, he‚Äôs an INTJ. We met 4 years ago when we worked at the same local hardware store. We worked pretty close together and I quickly grew fond of him. After a few months, I asked if he‚Äôd like to hang out over the holidays. Our first date was at a Five Guys the day after Christmas. Our second date was actually at his place for New Years Eve. We watched Blazing Saddles and hugged at midnight. I made the first move with the kiss as well - a couple weeks after NYE. I started seeing him every day after school, then staying the night occasionally... then one day, I was just there! He‚Äôs just like his favorite candy (M&M‚Äôs): hard outer coating, but with some warming up, you get to the chocolatey soft center. I guess I‚Äôm also like my favorite candy too (Reese‚Äôs): sweet outside, dense and nutty on the inside haha! I‚Äôm a bit of a wild child, very artsy and constantly breaking out in song or cracking a joke. He‚Äôs a very polite, reserved but warm, caring person who builds computers for fun and learns everything he can about technology and video games. These past four years have flown by! We‚Äôve been through a lot together and I couldn‚Äôt imagine going through life with anyone else. We‚Äôre best friends üíï
2	ENFP male here in a gay relationship with a INTJ. We met on a forum about 11 years back, I found my INTJ when he expressed in a thread his passion of an obscure video game which I was very fond of too. I made the first move by replying to that thread, then we started PMing each other, and that's how it came to be. Though, we did remain only close friends for a long time. I wanted more than that though, and I expressed it many times, but, he wanted to make sure I was being honest and trustworthy enough for a relationship. Then two years ago, we finally decided it was time to take that romantic leap. We're long distance, I live on the East Coast, and he lives on the West Coast. We finally saw each other for the first time irl last year. It was the most romantic week of my entire life. Seemed everything about him attracted me. From his stern look, his introverted and intellectual charm, the proper way he dressed like a gentleman, those tender moments where I could tell how much passion he had in his heart for me, all the fancy places we went on dates too, he was wonderful and I love him more than anything else in this whole universe. He is everything to me and helped me accept that I was gay when I was struggling with it for so long and even pulled me out of my most depressive state when I was at the lowest I've been in my life up to this point. I love him so much and I hope one day I can call him my husband.
1	Does ENTJ count? Hehe üòÖ
1	I'm the ENFP (female) and he's the INTJ.\n\nWe met the day I moved into the dorm where he lived. There was a big party going on that first evening, lots of loud and drunk people running around like crazy. I fit right in.\nThen, behind all that party-chaos, I spotted him. He was sitting in an arm-chair ignoring everybody around him. His nose in a book and a pibe resting in his hand. He looked like a guy from the 1920's who had accidentally stumbled right into the wrong century.\nI knew immediately that he was the one for me. And after some hard persuasion from my side, he reluctantly agreed to go out with me.\n\nHe was always extremely cautious, almost nervous, starting anything with me, and so I was the one initiating pretty much everything. At times I think he's been downright scared by how open I've always been with my emotions (though he would probably deny it if you asked him).\n\nIt's been seven years now, and we're still going strong. He's the dark to my light, the rationality to my insanity. I love him dearly, and if there really is such a thing as soul-mates, I'm sure he is mine. \n\nWe've had our fair shares of crash and falls along the way, but 10/10 would do it all over again.
1	INTJ married to an ENFP for 23 years together for 27. \n\nShe is a light in the darkness. Creative, adventurous, full of life, loves learning, loves culture, loves God, loves life, loves me. We were both crazy and immature kids when we met and we are completely different people now, but somehow still perfectly-perfect for each other. Together we have created a family, sold all our earthly possessions (twice), lived on three continents, run multiple businesses, renovated multiple homes, survived cancer, gone bankrupt, started over and thrived - cried, rejoiced, despaired of life, and everything in between. \n\n**It certainly has not been boring.** \n\nI would not trade her for anything in this entire world. I owe her my very life, because she is the essence of it. She says I'm the smartest person she has ever known, but I have learned SO many things from her - and when I look into her eyes, it makes me want to be alive.\n\n&#x200B;
1	im an ENFP married to an INTJ for 11 years.  no big whoop lol.  its not always easy but i dont think i would want to be with an ENFP like me.  one of us is enough.
1	Intp and enfp	Do you think an intp/enfp relationship can work long term? 
5	Mbti doesn't matter. 
2	Every type combination in relationships can work. The qeustion is rather how well it does work and if you are going to be satisfied with it. The MBTI vommunity can only give you estimated statistics there but in the end who have to decide for yourself who you think has the potential to keep you happy for a long time. It's a thing of a lot of introspection and your ability to know the other persons mind and potential or even your intuition and introverted feeling for that matter.
1	Yes.
1	Yes
5	Does anyone else take a bit to warm up to people?	I'm not sure if this is just a me thing, but I find that when I first meet people (especially in group settings, which I tend to feel really uncomfortable in), I'm usually pretty reserved for a bit until I can kind of observe the other person/people and get a better feel for what they're like. I know for sure I'm an ENFP, but I'm not at all the bubbly, rAnDoM, outgoing stereotype (at least not until I get to know someone pretty well or I'm drunk af). I'm very candid with my feelings even with new people, but don't tend to like talking about myself - I usually prefer to ask good questions and prompt others into talking about themselves instead. I'm also not a very cuddly person with anyone aside from my SO or maybe one really close friend. \n\nAnyone else here like that? Are these things I should try to overcome?\n\nSide note - what Enneagram does this sound like? EDIT - After taking multiple tests, it appears that I'm an 8w7 so - which I know is an unlikely combo, but the description fits me to a t. People always think I'm angry when I'm not, hahaa
4	Yeah. Definitely. I work in kitchens, and play a lot of live music, so trying to read people and the situation is a constant thing in my life. Really though, I think it's a good thing. Don't speak unless you have something to contribute, ya feel?
2	Hello! I'm an enfp female and I'm the same!! \nI take a really long time to warm up to people; while I'm still getting used to a person I tend to seem reserved and calm and all but once I become close with someone I'm the most outgoing, loud and random person ever. Many people think that I would love hugs and all but I'm actually really uncomfortable with hugs; the only one I might want a hug from is my current crush but that'll still be pretty awkward ahah
1	Yeah, it takes hanging out a few times in a group setting for me to feel comfortable really engaging with someone new. Sometimes the other person thinks I hate them or have something against them because they feel like I'm ignoring them, when in reality I just don't know how to engage with them yet and I don't like initiating uncomfortable experiences for myself. \n\nIts not a bad thing as long as its not impacting your life in a negative way, and it doesn't seem like it is. 
1	I can identify the more I've grown as an ENFP Enneagram 9v8 2v3\n\nIf you're a 4 you're probably seeing the authentic side of people often, so I can see why you'd be selective with your interactions.  The more authentic I've become the more selective I am.  Because I see more often who people really are.\n\nAnd a lot of people just aren't in alignment with the same values and goals I have.\n\n&#x200B;
80	How to slow down and not go too fast romantically/emotionally/sexually with a potential partner?	I've been single for nearly a year now. It's the longest I've been single in the past 3 years which is when I really started dating in general. Had my first bf when I was 18, didn't date after that for a while until I turned 21. I'm 24 now btw.\n\nAnyways, I decided not to date this long on purpose. After I ended my last relationship because he was emotionally abusive, I just got hit with some facts. Looking back on basically most of my relationships/flings, I realised I latch on someone EXTREMELY fast. I wasn't aware of that until that last break-up. I have a high sex drive so first thing I always did was get them in bed, me being the one taking clear initiative every time. I'm talking about first/second date sex. It's not even because I was horny per se, but because I felt a great connection with them and quickly assumed we will be great together. But now looking back, I think sex early on isn't good in any kind of relationship. I barely knew the guys, only talked to them for a few days/weeks.\n\nOnce I established a good sexual connection, my emotions would take over. I imagined this lovey-dovey romantic relationship that we will have but as reality has it, this is almost never the case. I've been in fake relationships in which either me or him (or both of us) didn't have genuine feelings for the other and just used each other for company/fun/battle loneliness.\n\nIt was hard to stay single at first and not flirt around or install dating apps like Tinder etc. It's become easier to deal with now. I don't feel that rush to be with someone anymore, I like who I am right now and I'm not actively "chasing" guys anymore. Like people say, I believe it will happen if it happens. But I'm afraid that if I do happen to meet someone I really like, I'll do this stupid shit all over again. I am adamant on not sleeping with anyone right away anymore though, that's something I can control. It's more the emotional aspect I'm worried about. I'll make myself believe in a make-belief romantic fairy tale again. I've also noticed lately that I've become way more picky in the guys I like. I find something about guys to dismiss them on purpose, I don't know why I do that. I don't really give guys a chance, but maybe it's just that my bullshit-radar has improved and I recognise it faster when a guy has certain intentions which I'm often right about in the end.\nDo you guys ever experienced this and if so, any tips on how to keep yourself emotionally reserved? It might as well not happen to me anymore since I feel like I changed, but just in case!
26	Probably the thing that helps me the most is having a circle of really strong friendships, and making sure they are booked into my schedule regularly - and I don't change that when I fall in love or start dating someone. For example, if I have a lunch date every week with a friend, I don't just stop doing that because I'm dating someone and want to spend every spare minute with them. Same if I call a friend twice a week. I keep it up as much as I can, or re-negotiate to call them once a week if I'm really pushed for time. I don't just go MIA and forget about my friends, like so many people seem to do. \n\nYou can also reduce the number of dates, for example go on a date with them once or twice a week initially, instead of just instantly seeing them on a daily basis. It's hard to keep a sense of perspective when you're suddenly talking to someone constantly, and it doesn't give you time to reflect and evaluate their behaviour and character. Having sex a bit later is also a wise idea, especially if having sex makes you feel very attached and intensifies the romantic feelings. \n\nTry to meet as many of your emotional needs with friends as well, for example I find platonic cuddling with friends or group cuddle parties really helps alleviate touch hunger - I think a lot of people jump into relationships just because they are so lonely and touch starved. Meditation, mindfulness and journalling can also really help with emotional regulation skills. I practice EFT tapping as well, and find it very useful. \n\nYou might also want to read about attachment theory, as it sounds like you might have an anxious attachment style. "Attached" by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller is a great book to check out.
17	Don't know how to help but I just wanna say I feeeeel you, I'm exactly the same it's scary. I also seem to be attracted to confident, sadistic and potentially emotionally abusive guys. I tried so hard to change but nice guys don't excite me. I lose my interest too easily when things are stable and consistent. 
8	STRONG FEELINGS FOR A PERSON ARE NOT ALWAYS ROMANTIC IN NATURE\n\nTook me a long time to realize this. I would jump in assuming so and realize afterwards that it's because they were shiny and new. Messy. 
3	Wow! I'm am an INFJ (Male) and going through the same situation üòÇ I'm 24 and on purpose l decided to be single and it's almost been a year from having any flings and talking to someone Serious over 2 years (Wow üòÇ time ‚è≥ flies ‚úàÔ∏è) . I've noticed just like you that l would move fast and in the end the relationship would crash sadly. After being single for the the longest since l was either in a relationship or talking to someone, I've noticed that people who l would be physically attracted too, I wasn't attracted to their personality. I've started to set boundaries on what l want in a relationship and what l don't want. If someone displays anything that l know long term I would not be Happy about l would save both our time and not pursue that Relationship. You're on the right path right now :) you know what you want and don't want based on your radar haha. You are growing and focusing on yourself as you should be and when you least expect it he will come in your life with a genuine Intention of growing a healthy connection with you for the long term üòÅ\n\nSomething l personally do l make a list on what l want in a Woman and follow that... Also what l want, l must mirror that too üëçüèæ\n\nFor example I personally don't want my Future Wife to watch Porn.. and since l must mirror that too I have to stop watching it üòÅ
3	I was in the same boat. Was in a relationship throughout college, lasted 6 years, didn't end so well.\nI found someone after, got attached way to quick just to get hurt again.\nFor some reason, now 26, I realize that I do want to settle down and such, and I am getting picky with traits I want to see some girls have. I went on a few dates last couple weeks, and me focusing on these traits, actually made me less sexually attractive to them. At first I wanted to get with any girl and see how it work out, but I think after realizing that I could get hurt again, and it might be a waste of my time when I could be with someone else that is worth it, made me tame.\nThink as you get older, you realize your worth and when you see others getting married and such around your age, you want the same too kind of.\nI hope this help. Hard to describe typing lol
3	Marry one of these people, that'll learn you real quick. \n\nKidding (somewhat) aside, you seem well along in the process. The bullshit radar is something you develop with experience. The other key, that you are working on I see, is that you need to be ok with being alone. 
3	LOL-are you me?! I could‚Äôve written this myself. I took some time off dating...eventually.  After coming out of an emotionally abusive relationship, I was in a bad place and slept around quite a bit. I was raised in a strict Christian and NOT sex positive environment, so add the shame of all that in there plus the desire to take short cuts in relationships in order to avoid loneliness. I found I would use sex as a shortcut to feel close to someone. Taking your time to get to know someone and trust them first is super important. I only took a 6 month break from dating, so kudos to you! I did learn what qualities to look for in a long term partner and am now happily married and very NOT lonely. Best of luck, and good job getting to this point! \n\n\nAlso, side note...therapy may be helpful! I learned I had many abandonment issues and was most attracted to the bull shitters because of this. 
3	I have no clue. I ended up getting married.
2	Yea I was a serial monogamist for many years, kept dating and never had a break until I met someone who I really had a great connection. After we couldnt get together I was single and celibate by choice.
1	I found a way around it all . I've invented myself an imaginary dashhund .  he cheers me up and I don't have to bother spending money in don't have on vets etc. \nConsequently I don't ever get laid its great
1	I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n- [/r/u_comagrey15] [How to slow down and not go too fast romantically\/emotionally\/sexually with a potential partner?](https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ComaGrey15/comments/avsz8j/how_to_slow_down_and_not_go_too_fast/)\n\n&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
1	If you had a magic wand, and could make your next relationship turn out exactly how you wanted it, what would your relationship look like after 3 months?
1	I'm the same way, lol. Not sure what the answer is. I've been with my current boyfriend for about a month now and we already said "I love you" to each other and talk about our future together traveling, having a family, etc. I know it's really soon but honestly, he's one of the best people I've ever met, and I feel like I'm at an age now where I don't really feel like playing around and hooking up anymore anyway (I was single for all of 2018 and it honestly got really boring after a while). As far as I'm concerned, he's The One. I feel like I can say this with confidence now that I've experienced many shitty relationships with other men and know what to look out for. Sure, no one is perfect, including my partner, but our strengths and weaknesses sort of dovetail and balance each other out, which is nice. We support each other.\n\nI don't have many friends either, but I have one or two I try to see semi-regularly (I just moved to Vietnam at the beginning of February, so I don't know many people yet) and I also try to go to events and activities that I want to even without my SO, which is something I never did in my past toxic relationships (I used to be THAT girl who would drag her boyfriend to everything). We also do things together and with groups of friends and strangers (potential friends!!).\n\nI'm really trying to maintain my independence this time, because it's bad for my mental health, my partner's mental health, and the health of the relationship if we spend all our time together. I love him and myself too much to become codependent this time. I also feel like I've mellowed out a lot now that I'm a bit older (24), and I no longer have the obsessive need to be around my boyfriend 24/7 either - I actually prize my independence and enjoy having new things to talk about/tell him about when we do see each other. \n\nIt's still difficult for me to leave him in the mornings, of course, but the separation also makes it sooo much sweeter when he walks in through the door after work.
1	I was the same with the whole falling in "like" and into bed too soon. But now I'm with the best boyfriend and we're almost at a year... I purposefully stopped myself from staying over at his place the first date even though he said I could stay because it was late. Even first kiss was held off until the second date. It wasn't easy because I actually was incredibly attracted to him but I'd been burned too many times before. I think you should just trust yourself to slow things down. You know what the problem is and you want to make the change. It might not feel as "in the moment" to be in your head calculating how fast is too fast when you're with a guy you really like, but looking back I promise you'll be glad you did. It gave me time to get to know my bf as a person and not as an object of sexual desire. Another thing... It's not often said if at all, but just as guys should treat girls with respect, girls should treats guys with respect in turn. Think of it as respecting the guy you like by taking the time to get to know him. I think that by offering this respect to a guy, he will respond in turn by respecting you, which is the basis for a healthy relationship.\n\nAlso as a rule of thumb, next time you want to move your sexual relationship forward with a guy, try telling yourself to wait instead and take that step forward the next time. That way you have time to think about whether you want to take that step or not and consider if this is really someone you want to be with.\n\nI hope this made sense, sorry it was so long! Good luck with finding the guy for you.
2	ENFP + INFP Relationships	
0	Im recently dating an INFJ and you can clearly see who's the ENFP here üòÇ	https://imgur.com/a/v59dD8d
8	What language ?
2	Translation:\n\n-When anorexics say they starve themselves, they do it because they feel in control I can super relate\n\n-I see. So you're parents are really controlling?\n\n-yup\n\n-and they gave me very strict curfew too\n\n-Im also threatened as well\n\nBasically we we're chatting about my eating disorder and he seems to really understand me. Sorry for not posting the translation~
2	I do not understand the language, but the grey has to be the IN_J for that "I see" is indication of an Ni / Se user and not an Ne / Si user.  I see word choice reveals penetrating insight and it is the language type that Beta quadras use ( the 4 types that are xNFJs and xSTPs) and Gamma quadras use (the 4 types that are xNTJs and xSFPs) use.  While the Delta quadras (xNFPs and xSTJs) and Alpha quadras (xNTPs and xSFJs) use very different language.\n\nThis is because 2 of these 4 quadras use Ni for internalized perception, while the other 2 quadras use Si for internalized perception and Ne for externalized perception.  "I see" **without** *actually seeing*, without actual sensory / lived experiences is easy for 8 of the 16 types, while the other 8 of the 16 types will use "I see" to express actual lived memories or the current present, not the memories of another.\n\n---\n\nOMG I am so weird^(for what I just wrote will be so cryptic to so many people), but we _N_Js are so weird üòÇ.
1	Religion without Religion	Hi ENFJs-\n\nDo Yall ever find religion to be so tiring. . . Like the second you see the word *religion* you instantly feel drained (even if you follow one) the world needs more love and then less needs.....\n
2	Why are you addressing ENFJ's in an ENFP thread, lmao. 
2	I think the variety of negative things done in the name of religion are what make the idea of it so draining. That said, I think human nature is what creates flaws in religion, not the other way around. 
10	What personal project(s) are you currently working on?	I've been working on some personal creative projects a lot the last few months and have noticed a lot of my friends are totally killing it with their own stuff recently too! We hype each other up about our progress, and it's been very motivating and inspirational so I want to see what y'all have been up to! Be it working out, painting, writing, volunteering, whatever, I wanna hear about it and how it's been going for you :) \n\nThe last few weeks I have been working on being more productive and focused by setting aside time to put out new designs and sketches and build my digital/online portfolio with my art! I've done a great job staying on track so far by letting myself relax on my mellow days and work on my inspired ones. Basically just feeling out my own mental state and using my upswing times to really get some progress going. \n\nAn INFP friend of mine has started a personal blog reviewing Boba Tea places around our city and is doing so great!\n\nAn ENFP friend of mine has been working on ideas for a comic series and has recently started dabbling in some photography to go along with his poetry. I think it's awesome and he's got a great eye for it!\n\nAnother ENFP friend of mine has started a small business selling upcycled/home made jewelry and unique clothing pieces, shes totally killing it and has made a lot of progress. \n\nWhat have you been inspired by lately? Do you have any current projects or ones you want to start? How is it all going? :) 
5	I've been working on my book I'm writing, practicing drawing more, close to debuting as a wrestler and shooting more in pool tournaments. There's still so much to improve upon both mentally and physically. Lately, I've gotten more compliments for the shape I'm in having lifted and worked out consistently for over a year now. It's mostly dudes saying it but it still shows how much progress I've made. I really enjoy movies and storytelling and want to use wrestling as a way to express characters and ideas I've had for awhile that I think would really be relateable, tragic, humorous and cathartic. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not even close to piquing just yet, haha. 
1	I've been trying my hand at writing more. I have a novel and a stage play in the works. That said, I'm quite a novice, so it's more just for practice/fun.
1	I love how many ENFPs I see on here are dabbling (or more) in writing! \nI, too, have been focusing primarily on editing the draft I finished some months ago atm. Been running into some trouble though, as I'm far from satisfied - but I've been able to stick with this project for far longer than I thought I would, so I'm kinda proud about myself! \n\nBtw, would love to hear what other ENFP-writers are working on. My own wip is an adventure story with a taste of western. 
10	My mom, 2 of my 3 sisters, my girlfriend, one of my best friends and I are all ENFPs, is this common? Are your close ones the same personality type as you?	They all did the Myers-Briggs test some time ago and we were shocked when all of us were the same personality type, except my youngest sister which is an INFP (still pretty close to us), do you share the same personality type as people that are close to you too? I thought it was very interesting.
5	Most of my friends are intuitive types, and I generally find that I get along best with XNXP, however I can talk to whoever! \n\nMy mom is an ENTP, my dad is an ESTJ, and my brother is an INFJ. Best friends are an ENFP & INFP. \n
3	A lot of my friends turn out to be ENFJ. My closest friends are ENFP and INFJ. I love them both, but the ENFP friend triggers me more than anyone ever has in my life, lmao. He's a dramaqueen and extremely emotional, even more so than me while I'm a girl. Hard to deal with, but we usually talk it out and we do have a lot of fun together. The INFJ friend is a lot more chill, I feel no pressure and such around him and I can say whatever I want most of the time without worrying about saying something wrong. With the ENFJ friends, they're often the friends I am not super close with, but still care about a lot. Idk what it is about them but with them I have the most misunderstandings, passive-aggressive arguments, etc... I think communication with them is off somehow on both ends.
2	Nope!! Everyone around me is a different type. I wish I had some other ENFPs in my life though :) boyfriend is an INTP, best friend is an ENTJ, no idea what my family is. 
1	My (sort of) SO, two of my best friends, and a number of my very good friends are all ENFP. My father is an INFP and I have a notion my kid sister is also an ENFP. 
1	My mom is ENFP like me, but I think she's a bit unhealtier than me for certain things, but a lot more creative for sure.
1	My sis is an ENFP and my mom is an entp
1	So I sense you had a "satisfactory" relationship with your family members (Mom, 2 of your 3 sisters) for you to feel comfortable with the type in your Girlfriend and one of your best friend.\n\nSo what type are you?
1	Most of my friends are INTP. Don't really know why lol. They also identify as slytherin.
1	NFs tend to find each other. :) 
1	My sister and father are ENFP. My girlfriend and roommate are INFP.  Best friend is ISTJ. Brother is INTJ. Mother is ISFJ. \n\nI used to also be surrounded by ENFPs. We tended to be drawn to each other and the energy. Weirdly despite being an ENFP I‚Äôve grown a distaste for them after some bad experiences (dating wise) so I don‚Äôt as much anymore. I do love the type tho. Much more likely to see me with a bunch of INFX. 
5	I hate myself	I'm having trouble accepting myself . I'm really harsh to myself and don't give myself the compliments I deserve. No one bothers to show affection anyway . I feel embarrassed after talking to someone  because  I can't  talk thoroughly and form words smoothly . My Mom and even my SO told me that I should talk clearly . But I'm having trouble changing my baby voice . \n\nI'm 17yo girl , as an ENFP  I'm completely emotionally drained  and don't know how to pull myself up and work on myself . I sometimes want to burn myself  alive . \n
3	Maybe you just need to slow your speech down and take time to pronounce the words clearly. Some of us ENFPs often blurt out everything too quickly in the excitement of a good story (I do this!). These days, I try to choose my words more carefully before I start, so I don't ramble on and lose people's interest.\n\nPlease don't hate yourself. Many of us remember being 17 and thinking we were awkward, weird and unlovable, but it was never true. Focus on the things that you like about yourself and the things you are grateful for. Remember the kind things people say about you. Give your Mum a big hug and ask her to tell you the things she loves about you.\n\nThe good news is, generally, the older you get, the more you like and accept yourself.\n\nTake care :)\n\n

3	Darling, first I hope you don't mind being called darling... \n\n> I feel embarrassed after talking to someone because I can't talk thoroughly and form words smoothly . \n\nI completely understand since I've been struggling as well to speak. Even though I absolutely LOVE chatting with people, I hate speaking in general because my oral skills do not fit my mind's eloquence. From times to times, I even practise what I am about to say, and it still does not come out as I have hoped. Perhaps I should go see a specialist... To sum it up, you are not alone in being embarrassed by the way you talk. You can always take diction classes, and why not theater! \n\nRemember there are so many other forms to communicate. No one expects you to host a TED Talk. \n\nAs for the baby voice, here's my prescription: watch movies, TV shows, and try to imitate the comedians' voices that you find pretty. \n\nRegarding your self-esteem, please read as much as you can. You will connect with characters because they are part of who you are. In other words, look up to your heroes since YOU both have similar traits. Find a passion in which you can delve. It will give you a ego boost for sure.\n\nTrust your experiences. Trust yourself because you know what is best for you hopefully. \n\nAcknowledge your achievements, and don't mind go fishing for compliments around your loved ones.\n\nI hope it will help!
2	This happens to me so much. The way that I work on it is to make myself slow down when I‚Äôm talking and make my sentences a little longer so that my thoughts come out smoother. Kind of like what I did with that sentence. I also do practice what I‚Äôm going to say but that‚Äôs usually when I have to give a tour at work. You will get it! It‚Äôs great that you are acknowledging you need help. That‚Äôs wonderful. Before you know it, you will find what works for you and share it with others as well! Xoxo
1	You need to think of yourself like another person. Would you treat someone else this way? Would you insult someone else this way? Would you be such a bully to them?
3	career advice please!	hey fellow enfp‚Äôs, help a gal out here, please? :‚Äô) so i just got my A level results back and they‚Äôre pretty decent, i think i could have a shot at getting into pretty much any course. but now the problem is, i have no idea what i want! everything is so appealing and i can honestly see myself doing both STEM & arts with the exception of mathematics & engineering. i also have a bit of a competitive streak in me so i‚Äôm likely to like anything i‚Äôm good at, and once i start something i usually will force myself to work my way to the top so rigour isn‚Äôt a concern for me. should i go for lucrative/profitable courses like medicine or should i major in something like english literature which i will enjoy so much (more maybe), but isn‚Äôt viewed as favourably upon in my community (bc of the starving artist stereotype)? \n\ntldr; passion or stability?\n\nplus you know, us enfps can be rather whimsical. i‚Äôve changed my ‚Äúdesired major‚Äù like 20 times already. LOL. 
5	I can't advise you on what you should go for, but I went with art & music as a teen and ended up a publishing data analyst.\n\nIf you love literature you could always use those skills in the publishing industry. It's relatively easy to get a job as an editorial assistant after Uni and you can work your way up there and have a good career.\n\nDo what you love, but have a career plan so you can still bring in the money :)
1	It's more about job selection than career exactly, but it's good to think about what you will be doing day to day and whether that works with your strengths. Detail oriented work kills me but I love interacting with people, so I consider that when I look at jobs or new opportunities.
1	Do what makes you happy and versatile. As an ENFP you will have several career changes so really don't sweat it. Employers are fast becoming more interested in job performance than job title so do what you love and you will excel.
112	Sometimes I unintentionally zone out during conversations & it‚Äôs really starting to upset my boyfriend :(	I just feel so bad about it! I swear I don‚Äôt even mean to. I know it‚Äôs happened before when we‚Äôre kind of lounging around the house and he starts a conversation with me. We‚Äôre usually on devices of some sort when this happens, so I do hear what he‚Äôs saying at first, but then I get preoccupied and distracted... and suddenly I hear him say ‚Äúwere you even listening to me?‚Äù I don‚Äôt even realize I‚Äôve stopped listening and started tuning him out. \n\nLast night, we went out to eat at a restaurant. I had had a pretty crazy day and I was super hungry, so I was really looking forward to eating. Towards the end of our meal, he said he wanted to tell me something. So he started talking about his brother, showed me a picture on his phone, and continued talking. I was listening and even asked him to show me the picture on his phone, but about 30 seconds in, I unintentionally retreated into my mind and started thinking about how uncomfortable I felt cause I ate too much, etc etc. I guess my eyes must have glazed over because all of the sudden I hear ‚Äúseriously, are you even listening?‚Äù And I totally forgot about the current moment I was in. So I tried repeating back what he was telling me, but I didn‚Äôt catch the end of what he was saying, so my attempt was embarrassing because I definitely zoned out and didn‚Äôt know what he said to me... So, he understandably got extremely mad and said he was getting tired of repeating himself and me not listening.\n\nAnd I just feel so bad because I don‚Äôt even realize when I start to zone out!! And if I ask him to repeat, he gets really upset because it‚Äôs basically me admitting I was not listening. \n\nDoes this ever happen to any of y‚Äôall? Any suggestions on what to do or say when this happens??
37	This happens to me sooo much! It's so annoying when it happens and I have to ask someone to repeat what they said ALL THE TIME! Don't know how to deal with it myself but wanted to let you know you're not alone
28	This is tough. But I think you may have to take a look at your own behavior and decide if you‚Äôre really trying to listen. If you‚Äôre really zoning out that often it might be something you can fix. Looking away from an devices and actually making eye contact with the person while they‚Äôre talking might help. 
20	This is an ADHD thing. xNFPs have high correlation to ADHD
12	I've spent a lot of time developing my communication (speaking and listening) this last year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've found the biggest thing is to BE in communication when this happens.  Sometimes it means I lean in closer, or I say "Sorry, I want to make sure I get what you're saying.  Can you repeat that last part?"\n\nWe ENFP's can be such GREAT listeners that other people might take for granted we automatically listen that way all the time.\n\nThe important thing is being in communication that what they're saying is important, and doing what you can to remain present, even if you think it might make you look bad to be open about it.
10	This sounds a bit like ADHD, but it just might be the Ne, idk. I have ADHD and I have this problem all the time, sometimes trying to focus on a specific part of the persons face, or a background object, can help keep you in the present and hopefully mind from wondering. 
4	It used to be like that, but I realized that it was rude and I trained myself to focus. It takes practice, but the fact that you feel terrible about it will help motivate you to improve. It will also help to let your BF know that you're aware of it and want to be a better partner.
4	Dang, a lot of ENFPs have this issue. My husband is an ESFJ and he complains that I tune him out often. It doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm a therapist and I listen ALL day. But yes, when my hubby talks to me, he uses Si details and I kinda skim and listen for the big picture ideas and mentally go ‚Äúyadda yadda details...basically you‚Äôre saying your employees are frustrating!‚Äù Sometimes I do a total zone out, and it‚Äôs usually with my phone in my hands or if I‚Äôm reading or listening to music. We have made a point to not be on our phones when we are spending time together. I also have been practicing mindfulness through yoga, which is when you pay attention to what you‚Äôre thinking about, while you are thinking it. Yoga also has you focus on your body and feelings in addition to thoughts, and when you feel your mind start to wander, you GENTLY bring it back to the present. It is a good skill for ENFPs to practice since we are not very present and not very in tune with Si (body) or Fi (feelings) sometimes. I‚Äôve been going to yoga nearly every day this month, and I have noticed that I have more mental clarity in addition to physical strength, flexibility and greater range of motion. Also to practice commitment and dedication to something such as yoga is good for ENFPs too. Hope this helps! 
4	I have this problem too. The way I combat it is I pick out important sentences in the conversation and then repeat them in my head. I repeat in my head about one in every three sentences. Not only does it help me listen but it helps me process what the person is saying. This trick was honestly a game changer for my listening comprehension skills.
2	One of my friends called me out on it (ENTP). I told him it's something I'm working on and I'm really sorry and that I hope it didnt make him feel as though what he was saying isnt important. I told him I value what he has to say and asked if he would tell me again. He said that was really mature of me, thanked me, and then retold his story. \n\nI think because our brains are constantly introvertedly thinking we do have the tendency to tune out and get deep in thought. We have to work extra hard to be present, that means limit your distractions and put a heavy value on what people tell you. As excited as you might be to direct the conversation to what you're excited about, you have to let others dictate the pace of conversation sometimes. 
2	So I do this all the time when my Si kicks in.  Something they say reminded me of a thing which reminded me of a thing and now I'm full blown in the middle of a memory I'm happily remembering or a future conversation I need to have.  \n\n\nIf he understands mbti at all maybe bring up it's your stress function and you don't have many xp points in it yet, but you're working on trying to catch it faster. \n\nEdit after reading other comments:. One of my close friends is estp, and I do this with him alot.  Part of it also is the excessive details they use.  I've usually gotten the point of what he says and moved on.  Maybe in some cases mentioning that you want a tl;Dr when youreower on attention resources might help.   My friend and I both have ADHD so it's easy for us to be like whoops, I zoned, or at least translate that to: "I wanna hear what you have to say" instead of "I gave up and want to move on"
1	What type is your boyfriend?
1	I've always done that since I was young. I can look someone straight in the eyes and not hear a word they said just cause I'm listening to my own thoughts. I've been doing better but I still zone out sometimes ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. It is what it is I guess. I really enjoy being in my own head a lot and I think it's just who I am
1	All the time. I zone out too much. Well  you just have to commit yourself to focusing on what he's saying. Its not that hard if youre actually interested. Trying putting yourself aside and using it as an opportunity to learn more about him. The more interested you are in what you can gain from the convo. .. i e understanding more about them or helping them with something the more you'll be inclined to pay attention. \n\n\nTbh i zone out at least 45% of the time cause im just not interested üòÖüòÖüòÖ. 
1	Get out of ya head! My brother used to get really bugged when he could tell I wasn't really there and I was just giving basic responses. If you focus and really listen instead of just waiting to reply, conversations will be a lot more entertaining.
1	aaah, sensing type relationships.
1	Here‚Äôs my (pretty strong) opinion on the case:\nA lot of ENFPs come across as fake or insincere at times because they in situations like this think lying about what just happened is somehow gonna make the other person feel better. While they actually see through your insincerity and doubt if you‚Äôre even interested.\n\nJust say excactly what happened, ‚ÄúI had a long day and now I ate too much at once, forgive me I totally zoned out. You lost me at ‚Äú...‚Äù, what did you say happened?‚Äù\n\nEven if you get a negative response the conflict will be easier to solve as you don‚Äôt have to defend your lies.\n\nGood luck üòä
1	I have this issue, too. I really appreciated someone‚Äôs previous comment about being sure that you are engaging in the conversation. After many years together, I find myself repeating what he‚Äôs saying automatically. Sometimes when I hear the words come out of my mouth, I realize that it‚Äôs the first time they have sunken in. It probably makes me seem a little zombie-like, but I have found that it helps to snap me back into the conversation. \n\nWhen my husband is talking, often times I know I need to turn off my phone or tv or whatever other distraction there may be because my focus will shift to that. Even when there are no other distractions I can end up in my head, particularly after a busy day when I know I need to zone out to recover properly. \n\nI have a 25 minutes commute home from work, and I have found that this alone time works great with my routine to ensure I can give him my full attention when I‚Äôm home. ENFPs need to recharge from heavy social interactions, so I would suggest working in some alone time into your routine. Could be a walk, a shower, a workout routine, you name it. Something that doesn‚Äôt scream ‚ÄòI need to get away from you‚Äô but that you can feel obligated to direct your attention to.\n\nI still get frustrated because he talks at length about his hobbies that I don‚Äôt really have an interest in. I engage because I love him. Long ago, I stopped reciprocating those types of conversations with him. As an ENFP, if I can sense that someone isn‚Äôt engaged or interested, I don‚Äôt get any satisfaction from the conversation. He is an INTJ.
1	Yes I do this all the time. I explain it to my girlfriend that I am a lot like JD from scrubs. My minds inner voice/vision can be so potent that I draws me in unintentionally and often it happens with terrible timing.
1	Everyone make mistakes. You‚Äôll probably have plenty of zone-outs in the future you can honestly apologize for üòÇ\n\nHonestly apology is almost too strong of a word, if you are forgiving with his weaknesses and you have an otherwise healthy relationship, he will learn to accept that this happens regularly and it will just feel like an explanation. üòä
1	Hello! I'm an INTJ and so is my fella. When my bf starts to zone out while I'm talking, I just figure he's got some overwhelming thought-process afoot, so I let myself kind of trail off. I might ask him what he's thinking about.\n\nHe'll probably tell me, because it's not like he was trying to diss me, he'll just have some really overwhelming inner monologue about something or other. I'll be happy to hear what's going on with him, and get to know him a little better in the process.\n\nWe were talking about that dinner of yours, and he let me know I do the same thing, just kind of randomly go somewhere inside my mind, and he never takes it personally. We both agree that when you are intimate with someone, part of that is that their mind is going to drift. No one is going to be 100% concentrated 24/7. I think it's natural. \n\nI wonder what personality-types don't accept/tolerate this? It's hard for me to imagine. 
1	It happens to me when the conversation is boring. 
1	It just sounds like you‚Äôre a daydreamer, so I‚Äôm similar in that sense. Keep refocusing yourself on the moment- maybe try keeping a rubber band on your wrist and snapping it softly everytime you zone out. 
1	I literally zone out during conversations because I am trying not to and end up thinking about all the reasons and ways I zone out all the time. 
1	Mindfullness meditation would prob be helpful. It made my life very dofferent, although i‚Äôve never had this particular focus/listening problem
1	Know when you are distracted - which is not just by a phone, it includes stress and hunger. Then don't have important conversations during that time. \n\nMy intj partner can't talk while driving ...no matter how short or light of a topic, so we just avoid it and listen to music. It's jitbhiw I operate, but compromise and adaptations make relationships better
1	Hi there humblespark!\nI'm an ENFP and this might not be just an ENFP thing with respect to the human brain, but definitely would be more common amongst us ENFPs (happens with me too).\n\nA healthy mindset (hold on, I'm NOT saying you're depressed) along with a healthy body is necessary for me avoid situations like these. And here 'healthy mindset' just means that I'm really into EVERYTHING (focus nine thou) that I'm doing throughout the day (even if it's pooping). And what that means is, that I'm not stressing out about anything else while doing that particular task.\nSo for example, (sorry to gross you out people, but this serves as a good example) when I'm in a 'healthy mindset', while pooping, I really don't think about things that I need to get done (why should I think about the things that I have to get done cause I'm gonna be thinking about that thing anyway when it is the time to do it - say studying).\n\n Think about it, why does your mind wander off during conversations with anyone?\nI can see 2 reasons \nA- you don't really want to talk about the thing that that person is talking about.\nB- you're subconsciously stressed about other things that you did previously during the day or need to do afterwards, causing your mind to get sucked into a kind of a vortex.\n\nNow since this has been happening with you when you're with your boyfriend, I have a feeling that it's case B. \n\nAnd a 'healthy body' is just a healthy body, you've got to start taking out time for your fitness, etc..\n\nYou've gotta stop stressing out there, humblespark. Whatever it may be. Feel free to message me.
1	Is it possible that you're tired and not getting enough sleep? Just wondering because I find it MUCH harder to concentrate if I'm tired, hungry, or stressed. Maybe you also need to explain to him that you can't easily focus when you're on a device, so if you want to fully concentrate, you both have to put down your phones etc. If this happens even when you're not tired/sleep deprived and don't have many distractions, I would look into adult ADHD. \n\nSometimes there are deeper reasons why people do this, and it can involve things like having an avoidant attachment style and fear of intimacy. When you don't listen well, it breaks the emotional attunement in a relationship, which reduces the intensity of the closeness and intimacy. People can subconsciously sabotage their relationships by doing this without realising what's behind it. \n\nOr sometimes the reason is less deep and more straightforward, and you simply find the person boring. There are some people I just find too boring to listen to for long periods of time, and I know they are not a good match for me as a close friend or romantic partner. 
1	Hi, my gf is an enfp. I am an infp. She does this when we are out at dinner and is easily distracted by the surroundings. I used to get very upset about it and confront her about it. She tries very hard to not zone out or be distracted and I recognize it. Not right away but little by little. She still does but after a few discussions I found getting upset is not productive for both of us. If she does this, I move on and either return to the discussion or move onto another one. It's not the end of the world for me because we still have the conversation. What I'm trying to say is that getting upset is natural but not moving on from it or not acknowledging that it is something you have little control over is unhealthy. Find a solution for both of you. Not just him.
1	I feel that a lot too. I mean often it happens that my boyfriend says something and i need time to process it because i want to understand its interconnections or remember similar topics and need to sort them regarding the topic he talks about and meanwhile he goes on about  what he wants to tell me. And this is the point i lose track of the conversation.  Glad that my bf is also N so he understands it, but it bothers me too. I want to improve on that one  so my bf doesnt feel ignored, because i really dont want to make him feel like that.
1	Do you notice yourself ‚Äúzoning out‚Äù on occasions other than these few isolated incidents with your SO? Have you looked up anything on dissociation? May or may not be helpful...
1	Well, first off, lots of people zone out like that. Getting angry at all is a very immature and wrong way of approaching it in his end. I'm saying that as someone who was on his end and on your end too. It's a little, very little, embarrassing to not fully listen, but that's something you can work on and he should know it's not personal. Other than that, like I said, this isn't even an ENFP thing, everyone does this and it doesn't make you wrong. If you explain to him that it happens sometimes and you're sorry, then he should change his reaction. If it's that big of a deal to him he needs to work on himself because you're not the problem in this situation, his lack of emotional maturity is the problem. As a fellow ENFP, don't let people walk on you just because they can't handle their emotions. Their emotions: their problem.
0	Im writing this in the parking gatage and waiting for my car to warm up. So bear with me.\n\nEver since I started my job completely isolated from everyone, rarely communicating to anyone... and the times i do, its through phone and email.\n\nMy boss is a piece of garbage who can't hold a conversation beyond biggoted bullshit, ive no coworkers and nobody to go home to during the weekdays.\n\nI only see my girlfriend on the weekends and the times I do, I can't for the life of me, pay attention to ANYTHING she says. I'm stuck in my head all the time. It's bad... really bad.\n\nSame goes for friends and family. I'm just in my own world and can't get out.....\n\nNever used to be THIS BAD
0	Well no shit. You‚Äôre on your phone instead of paying attention to him. You think you have two brains or something? Give him your undivided attention. 
59	When we need our space but we still want people to know we love them.	
15	This is the reason why it took me so long to believe I was an extrovert..
6	It's really hard going from the life of the party, to a human/blanket burrito for months on end. \n\nWhen you need to recharge, don't push like I did, go and rest. It'll come to bite you in the tushy if you don't. I know first hand.
2	Hahaha, spot on.
3	It is what it is?	Hello \n\nEvery ENFP that I know hates the phrase ‚Äúit is what it is‚Äù. Is that true for you and why is that? I use the phrase often, but more when I have to reluctantly accept something. 
2	I like that phrase and use it a lot. Mainly to stop myself from overthinking things. 
2	I too used to hate that phrase. But now it has helped me to not go insane with all the "what ifs." It grounds me and reminds me that this is reality and that saves me from a lot of mental and emotional exhaustion. 
1	Depends on how you use it. In shitty situations that are out of my control, I often have an "it is what it is" mindset. Meaning that me being angry or sad won't change the situation and I will just have to accept the fact that it happened/ is happening. (Delayed flight, its raining outside, etc.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut it shouldn't be used in situations where you can alter the outcome or when you made a mistake and try to brush it off as it is what it is. For example: getting cold food in a restaurant and still eating it, or when someone took advantage of you etc
1	I used to hate it but I got tired of trying to fix things. Now I like the phrase. Fuck em
1	I use it a lot because sometimes "it is what it is". Its an acceptance of the reality of a situation, rather than projecting Ne possibilities or expectations onto it. Its not my duty to resolve every problem, to fix everything broken, to clean every mess, to heal every person. Sometimes things just are, oftentimes things just are. 
1	Not at all I use it quite often when the situation is no longer in our control.
11	ENFPs, How Do You Make Difficult Decisions?	I've got a tough decision to make, curious how others arrive at their decisions! 
20	I ask myself which decision best fits my long term values.  
17	 I just avoid them until the pressure of not making the decision becomes too intense. And then I usually panic and choose the wrong thing lol. 
16	Ideally react at speed on pure instinct, using only the force and intuition. Those are my best purchases, location moves, and relationship kick offs.\n\nIf I have to think, it takes a LOT of thinking, research and procrastination, overdue deadlines, and eventually panic. But I try to remember my first gut instinct because it's usually right.\n\nIf you want to know your heart, flip a coin. If you're disappointed, there's your answer
7	Think about what you'll regret most.  Having done a thing.  Or having not done a thing.  Act appropriately.
6	I hate making long-term decisions, even when it's for mundane things... In fact, I once spent four hours trying to make up my mind about a coat. I had bought one, then I decided to return it to take the other, and vice versa for about two times.\n\nWhen I make difficult decisions, I feel like I am closing a dark-red door, when I could have chosen the glittery-pink one, or even the yellow one with a sunflower on it. Often you cannot possibly go back to have another shot.\n\nIn my humble opinion, sometimes, you should go with the bold option, cry about all the lost possibilities, then enjoy your choice. Before hand, you can always ask people whom you trust for advice, but your final decision has to come from your heart.
5	i reach out to my immediate circle of friends and family (3 siblings, husband, 3-4 of my closest friends, occasionally my parents).\n\nthen i make a spreadsheet with my options and list the pros and cons for each.\n\nthen i do yoga and meditate, get some good sleep and let all the information really sink into my body and brain.  from there, i use intuition to determine where my gut is leading me.  but it's important for me (personally) to get the data first and add that into the mix.  when i was younger i often worked JUST from intuition and i'd often find later that i missed out on some important factors due to lack of data.  so now i get data but still heavily factor in my intuition.
3	By understanding we have high agreeableness and lower conscientiousness personality traits. As a person we need to be mindful of the things we are weak in to become a more well rounded human. Knowing who you are is knowing who you are not and so learning to be more confrontational in nature and perhaps more dominant helps in making decisions you are confident in. Life is hard and there are dragons to slay so head up shoulders back because your decisions matter.
3	If the choice isn't obvious when you think about it, then go with your gut. \n\nIt doesn't *really* matter what you choose. You choose something, then you go down a path, and on that path there will be more choices, and so on and so forth. This present you exists at this time and you can only make decisions based on the information you have available to you. Future you might have more wisdom on the situation, but they can't help you and they wouldn't know what the long term outcomes of the other path would be. \n\nMake a decision and roll with it. Don't think about what could have been, because the grass is always going to be greener. The reality of a situation is always going to be more disappointing than what one is capable of imagining. You will regret either decision if you choose one but try to live in the other by thinking about it all the time. \n\nA couple years ago I had to make my first decision on a car. I got a lease, I was torn between a car that is a bit nicer and more consistent but also more expensive, or a car that was fine, suited my needs but didn't have everything I wanted, and was cheaper. I knew that I would be happy with either car, because its just a car. I knew that I would regret the extra $100 or whatever per month if I go with the expensive one, but I would regret missing out on features that make life easier with the cheaper one. \n\nI went with the expensive one. I rarely think about that extra $100 I could have per month, I often think about how nice it is to have the features I want and that it looks nicer. \n\nHope it helps\n\nEdit: I'm not saying to go with the more expensive option in the situation I was in. If I had chosen the cheaper car I'd be focusing on what I'm doing with the extra $100 rather than on the features I'm missing. 
2	think about what feels right to me, try to cut out beliefs/voices of others, ask myself what im really seeking to get out of a decision and what I really WANT to seek to get, and ask myself which option would lead to the least regret (last one is proven to lead to better decisions actually)
1	I use my past experiences to aide me in making the best decision for myself. I let myself face failure and accept full responsibility of my mistake if the decision is incorrect, and continually learn from the experiences, both good and bad. I also dissociate my intense feelings in the decision making process as much as I can because my emotions can distort and shroud my logic. And most importantly, I make the decision that would be the most fair for everyone, including myself.
3	NEED HELP WITH INTJ MALE	Need help dear ENFPs  and INTJs!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI love a guy (INTJ) I met 3 months back. He loves me dearly too. You wouldn't believe how much he does for me just to make me happy and comfortable! He is also protective of me. And I feel grateful for it. I see a future with him and this is coming from a person who dates a lot but never gets stuck on one person. I can nurse a broken heart to health pretty quickly and well. However, this one person is my anchor. I want to just make it all happy and rosy for him. I want to keep telling him how much I love him.  Although it is him taking care of me and I feel bad about it because I don't want him to worry and exhaust himself.  But, he doesn't feel that way perhaps? I proposed. He rejected my proposal. He told me he has feelings for me and that I am his best friend. He says,he is not ready to get into a relationship. He is also in a not-so-happy place in life right now.. He also says that I give him permanent happiness. He says, he'll never let me go out of his life! THAT IS HUGE!  But, I do not just want to be chirpy to him. I love him and  I want to see him succeed. I want to motivate him. I believe in him so much! I mean, it's not me. It's impossible for him to not be successful!   \n\n\nSorry, I got a little carried away there. However, I wonder if he considers me as a love interest? I mean, we do kiss and make love and all that. We are different people but we are so similar in our beliefs. I used to feel like I am weird for thinking the way I do. But there are so many beliefs that are just similar! We have so much fun together. He takes his me-time as well. Is it because I am not pretty and hot? Is that why he takes no interest in me? Because I do not want to change myself. I love myself as I am. But, at the same time, I wonder if this INTJ guy ( age below 25) will ever take any interest in me? Let me know if you had similar experiences and how these worked out? I am ready to wait for him but I don't want to go through the same, old "waiting for a ship at the airport" again. It hurts a lot and it TAKES a lot of time to come out of. But I adore him so I don't want to give up on him either or distance myself ( which I will do to emotionally protect myself for a while? ) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPLEASE HELP ME WITH WHAT HE SEES ME AS AND WHAT HE WANTS OF ME ASAP! 
1	So many things you told about him dear, He **absolutely** loves you.\n\nThe problem is this - \n\n> He is also in a not-so-happy place in life right now..  \n\nThis seems to stop him , once he conquers it , everything will be even more good. Help him in solving it \[know that , Your just being there for him might be more than enough source of strength for him\] ...take that extra mile\n\nAt the same time i will advise you to also grow & prosper in your endeavours , add to it the fitness part too \[in mind  body\] \[& the self improvement stuffs\]\n\nWrite out all your worries/insecurities on a piece of paper & try to solve them one by one , one at a time .\n\nIdk if i chalked it up all or am missing something but hope this helps ya!
1	Auch. That sucks getting rejected like that. I'm sorry, sweetheart D:\n\nOne thing I've found being in a relationship with an INTJ is that... INTJ need a LOT of time to process things. Especially emotions.\n\nThis can be frustrating at times. The reason why INTJ is feeling off or acting strange, can be SO clear, and still INTJ takes forever to figure it out himself. \n\nPushing the solution on INTJ has never really worked (at least not for me), so, I think my best advice to you, would be to brace yourself with patience. You can try to solve everything and force him to talk it through with you, but he won't listen fully until he is ready to do so. \n\nSo, just wait for him. When he's ready, he'll come to you. And if he doesn't, well, that's his loss.
15	Emotional promiscuity?	Once again, I have had a few dates with someone who has fallen hard for me and is pretty heartbroken that I'm not interested in dating further. I need to stop hurting people this way. I like being open-hearted, but I'm thinking that maybe I should be more guarded in dating. I open up a little; then others open up to me; then they think that the connection is more meaningful to me than it is. Or-- it IS meaningful to me, but I also have equally meaningful connections with strangers on the bus.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow can I be myself when I'm dating and yet not feel like I'm being... emotionally promiscuous? I just googled that phrase and found a lot of uber-Christian conservative stuff about relationships outside of marriage. Not relevant to me. But I do become emotionally intimate, quickly, with most people I talk to in the world. \n\nHow can I be myself and not give people the wrong impression in a way that is hurtful?\n\nHelp?
5	I feel like I struggle with this as well, and then get overwhelmed! 
4	All I can say is that its not us that's the problem. It's everyone else!
4	I was at a hollywood producer's book launch a few months ago, she had some amazing friends helping her with the event.  A few times I thought I might want to ask a few of them out - I was feeling pretty magnetic and attractive - but in the end I knew I wasn't actually romantically interested in any of them in the long run.  So why waste my time and theirs?\n\nI'd rather spend my romantic and dating energy pursuing someone I think I might really want to build a life with.
2	Have been there so many times, I've also heard once from a super angry ESTJ who I was meeting regularly just in a circle of friends and then he asked me out and I rejected, he was cursing me and saying that I was flirting with him from the very first time we met and I was indeed the one who was interested in him!! After those experiences I try to keep my guard hard until I decide to fall for the person myself but this is also not a very good solution as I gave false signals even to ppl whom I was interested in. 
2	I‚Äôve struggled with this a lot. Now that I am dating again I‚Äôm back in the same boat as you. I find it helpful to change the topic a lot and try to be as reserved as possible when listening and engaging. Not boring but just more drawn in (if that‚Äôs capable) and less animated. That way when they tell me exactly what I don‚Äôt want to hear (being a breath of fresh air, being so easy to talk to, that they CANT BELIEVE IM SINGLE!‚Äîlove that one, or that they‚Äôve gone ahead and planned more dates for the future) I can rest easy knowing they led themselves on. No guilt that way because I know I wasn‚Äôt even giving them my full self! 
2	Same. But I try to be clear from the start. I tell them I‚Äôm not sure how far I want to take this, or that I am dating multiple people at the moment. 
3	its worse when youre an enfp and a aquarius.....youre either drowning them or fleeing the crime scene. i feel like im emotionally water boarding them and leaving them stockholm'd.  \n\ni made a connection with a dell support technician and i think he thinks im calling him back to continue troubleshooting, and talk about our lives and similar circumstances. truth is, i never want to call that place again. oy vey!
112	Is it an ENFP problem or is it just me?	Does any ENFP also share this problem of : Having many, way too many thoughts on any given topics, that your brain generates really fast. However when you are asked to write them down, it becomes difficult, as it is hard to deliver your thoughts in a more organized manner, and sometimes the layout of the written ones seems very messy and lack of logic. 
27	Oh also another tip would be to talk to yourself on camera. Just talk about random shit and see how you deliver it. Try to improve on how you talk and explain. \n\nI found myself talking better after sending video messages back and forward to people.
12	This is from your Ne, ENTPS have this problem too. 
7	Yeah, I'm better at texting because I can think about what I say and build a decent sentence in my head. But in person you generally don't have time for that in a conversation so I blurt out my thoughts. People can't always follow that way. 
4	Yes.
3	This describes exactly me, 
3	"Instead of thinking, you just say and do things" sounds too attractive! And wish you the best too !
3	I could write a fantastic series of young adult novels if not for this issue. 
3	happens to me too! (INFP) I end up making hella infographics with arrows always zooming across the page
3	I‚Äôm ENFP and ADHD. I am like this and I always blamed ADHD ü§î there are other things that are supposedly caused by my ADHD that I‚Äôve seen a lot of ENFPs say they struggle with. Time management, organization, inability to focus, procrastination, etc. Maybe.... ADHD is really just Ne üò¶
2	Doesn‚Äôt everyone...?
2	Yes definitely. I described it to my INFJ friend as an uncontrollable factory line at some constant pace (my ability to communicate ideas) continually generating parts (ideas) at a faster rate. This causes a ton of clutters and jams at the end of the line (my delivery), making my ideas sound messy, unorganized, and sometimes incomplete.\n\nThanks to my ENTJ best friend and pure math studies in university, I am starting to become better at organizing those ideas. However I could always use improvement in it haha.
2	I FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY 
2	Just in response of someone who asked Doesn‚Äôt everyone do this???\n[ENFP and INFJ similarities and differences in this. The flip but with the same intentions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/avbzr5/comment/ehephx5) 
2	You'll get the hang of it. Try, instead of trying to order them out, to let the stream of consciousness flow out of you for awhile until your energy gets a little used up. Later, start organizing the thoughts into groups that are related, putting any kind of ancillary thoughts out or rewording them. Then you can order them in importance and further expound on the subjects. This is the most effective way I've found to explore a subject for a paper. I used to do a first draft=final draft mentality thing and be ok with Bs and Cs but that little bit of extra effort really upped my writing game. The key is to separate the analysis from the narrative until they become more coherent. Believe me, smart people know what bs sounds like so only assert what you know as fact. Keep opinions close because opinions change as you age.
2	Story of my life üòÇ Could also be that I‚Äôm an ENFP in combination with having ADHD üòµ
2	Yes, it's exactly like this for me. If you want this to stop and you have a bit of cash, I recommend CBD oil. I personally smoke weed but CBD works for the thoughts. You dose based on how much you need to fix the problem. I'd say 30-50mg is good.\n\nA good sites for CBD is Lazarus Naturals, there stuff is priced better. The only downside is it can make some people sleepy.\n\nWeed helps too although you can get hooked and it could ruin your life cause you become so lazy.\n
1	This is me but I always thought it was just my being bipolar. So that's fun.
1	I think we all have our own ways to get the thoughts out. I can‚Äôt communicate too well verbally bc my mind moves too fast when I talk. I‚Äôm saying things out loud at the pace of rabbit but my mind is moving like a Ford Mustang. I do my best communication through writing and drawing I‚Äôm much more present for that. 
1	ENXP here. I definitely have a problem and for some reason, I can feel a physical burnout? I was reading through the comments and for sure, I agree that it‚Äôs an Ne problem.\n\nMost recently though, as I‚Äôm falling asleep, I‚Äôll start getting into a rapid fire streamlined thought journey about everything and nothing. Thoughts will keep shooting up sporadically until I get the conscious thought of ‚ÄúHave I fallen asleep yet?‚Äù The thoughts don‚Äôt even make sense or they‚Äôre genius! It‚Äôs just thinking through it.\n\nI find it interesting because when I was more ENFP, super confident to expressively say anything with confidence and eloquence. However, nowadays (more so as ENTP), it is a bit harder to express clearly.
1	My teacher once asked us to make a mindmap of our dreams and mine was so complicated and all over the place and she commented negatively about it lol
1	Also try Toastmasters they really help you learn how to organize your thoughts into amazing speeches without  losing that ENFP spice
1	I face this problem too. This thread is amazingly beneficial
1	Yes, but that‚Äôs because I have ADD, I do not think it has anything to do with being ENFP.
1	I honestly do this so much, and it drives me insane. I have days where my thoughts on something go a mile a minute, but trying to pluck one out and coherently write it is like trying to grab sand with a sifter or soup with a fork. My favorite thing for that so far has been voice message or freewriting and just leaving my typos in. Then, once the idea feeding frenzy is finished, I can pick stuff out and clarify it. 
1	Yes. I can generate an opinion on basically anything in 10 seconds. I have a hard time with writing because i can see the whole picture in my mind but don‚Äôt always have the words to describe it. I‚Äôve found the best way to do it is just start and then go back and make sure it actually makes sense
5	An ENFP who's very lost	I‚Äôm just gonna word vomit everything I‚Äôm thinking right now, even though it might come out as total crap - but please, I need someone else‚Äôs thoughts on this.\n\nLet me just also add that this is my first post on reddit - I used to be a lurker but this was so huge to me I couldn‚Äôt ignore it and decided to make an account and post.\n\nI used to be an ENFP. I was riding high on it, energetic, and making friends left and right. I valued who everyone was, and I loved getting to know people and discovering who they were. I embodied the ‚Äúcampaigner‚Äù spirit. I would come to this subreddit and laugh and relate to everything that was being shared.\n\n(I find that I‚Äôm very bad at putting my thoughts and feelings into words, and they come out all wrong. I should probably fix that.)\n\nHowever, for the past year or so, I‚Äôve made some major lifestyle changes. First, I lost 40 pounds, and put on some muscle. I also controlled my eating habits, and developed discipline that I never knew I could have. I also switched up my style - rather than wearing the typical sweatpants and baggy hoodie I‚Äôve started wearing sweaters and khakis, bomber jackets and joggers.\n\nWith all these changes though, I‚Äôve felt like who I am as a person has changed. I‚Äôve lost all of my sensitivity and with it, a lot of my intuition with people. Today I decided to retake the MBTI test because I‚Äôve felt like a different person for a while now. I was somewhat surprised but largely disappointed to find out that I‚Äôm now an ENTP. After reading the description, I hated what it was saying (no offense to all the ENTPs out there). I came back here for the first time in a while actually, and discovered I really couldn‚Äôt relate or feel what was happening.\n\nI don‚Äôt like being an ENTP. It used to be that being an ENFP defined me, and I‚Äôm jealous of what I‚Äôve lost.\n\nI guess the reason why I‚Äôm writing this is because I just want someone to talk to about it. Anyone who‚Äôs been through similar things, or has any comments at all, I‚Äôd love to hear them. I just don‚Äôt feel like the same person I‚Äôve been for a large part of my life.\n\n(also, I feel like what I wrote is absolute garbage but I kinda just want to get it out there. I‚Äôm probably gonna come look at this in the morning and hate myself but oh well. It‚Äôs important to me that I put this out there.)\n\nTL;DR - I used to be an ENFP and with some lifestyle changes, I‚Äôve somehow become ENTP and don‚Äôt like it.
5	You're still an ENFP. You aren't going to change because you developed discipline, its just growth. You just probably no longer identify with ENFPs who were at that stage of development you were in. Don't worry about the tests. \n\nYour post could have been written by me. I've lost a lot of weight over the last year, gotten a lot stronger and healthier, developed discipline in my diet and my entire lifestyle, have dived deeper into hobbies or passions, and have overhauled my style given the need to get new clothes. It was the first time i've ever really chosen how I present myself. I'm still an ENFP though, though I wasn't really in to MBTI at this point a year ago. I got into it and it took a while to really settle on ENFP because so many of the aspects weren't resonating with me as I was growing. Then I realized that I was actually growing, that the decisions I was making day-to-day were improving me as a person and not just shedding weight or looking cleaner. I connected the dots in my life and started looking at what triggers growth or change in the ENFP, what does a healthy or unhealthy ENFP look like, when do people develop x functions, etc. \n\nI found that a lot of those things resonated with me. In a life where most things come easily, discipline and determination don't. Because we didn't need them to get to where we needed (yet). While other types needed structure and focus to achieve moderate success in school or work or in hobbies, ENFPs and other Ne types could float on by being naturally above average (which is often good enough for a time). Obviously there are reasons why ENFPs might struggle in these areas related to personal issues, but overall Ne is going to carry us over the bumps that others hit. We run into problems when the barrier to success is discipline. 
2	I have this exact problem! Like brain vomits, ideas seem smooth and perfect in my head however when I try to put them down or verbally share them with others, they just become very messy and lack of logic. Check out my post, I raised questions regardging this issue too!0
1	I suggest this retyping is actually suggesting growth.  ENTP's can be great at success and effectiveness.  Maybe you're not losing anything but adding new things.\n\nMaybe you experience being less sensitive because you're becoming more goal-oriented.  A lot of ENFP's would see that as progress - care less about your feelings and develop more results in life.\n\nI had a friend today who had a friend's car stolen in front of her house, she was going on and on about how she was avoiding the call to him finally I said "You don't strike me as the kind of person afraid to talk to someone." She rolled her eyes for a second but that cut right to the heart of the matter because she's a really strong person who started to rightfully freak out.  The comment got her back on track, as insensitive as it was, she finally started to talk about HAVING the call rather than avoiding it.\n\nI think a strong ENFP can produce results without having to worry about if they're being sensitive or not.
1	It seems we struggle with the opposite issue. I am always typed as an ENTP and I love everything about it. However as I get older anxiety and, well,  the world  plagues me I behave ENFP. I care way too much about the people around me and wish I didn‚Äôt. I so wish I could rewind time and be the person I used to be. \n\nI can‚Äôt exactly come up with a solution for you, but I thought it might help to hear someone else is having a mind fuck.
1	You... don't change your type. When you're teenager your type and where it's going is basically sealed.\n\nYou either never were enfp in first place or... this description kind of sounds like Ne-Te loop or Si grip.\n\nENFPs are mostly about novelty and moral convictions (Ne, Fi)\nIf enfp is in bad point in life, in stress it may start to focus on lower, less intuitive to them, therefore less pleasant, functions.\nSudden organization? Sudden meticolous care of body? It really sounds as if sth caused you to use Te Si instead. (The functions usef primary by ISTJ and ESTJ people)\n\nSuddenly losing intuitiveness in people is definitely not ENTP thing. They have tertiary Fe function that allows them to try and understand people. Caring about your own body is also not ENTP thing.\n\nWhen I hit my low point in life I focused on trying to be very body oriented, very organized and pseudo successful person, and since it wasnt natural for me, it caused me to abandon other parts of me. I didn't want to use my Ne, because it means changes and running away from routine caused me panic attacks, didn't want to use my Fi, me being in anyway emotional or careful about my own needs would be counterproductive. Man, that was painful.\n\nTests are not sth that shows you for 100% who you are. When I hit low point in life, I also tend to score random stuff like ISFJ. \n\nThere's a reason why all the diagnostic tests, f.e. depression, adhd, tell you to not treat your potential high score as proof you have adhd - it can be sth else that has simmiliar symptoms.\n
1	 I am scoring ENTP or INTP myself.  If I go with the cognitive functions, it makes sense why i have an overlap. My day to day is all about Ti and Fe, which help define those 2 types, and i have to park my Fi or I use it with a fine touch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy i still consider myself an ENFP is really a myers brigg technicality based on the cognitive functions . Counter-intuitively, what we extravert as a mature enfp is intuition and external consistency, while a mature entp would extravert intuition and harmony. So the mature enfp would look more of architecture/designer type, while the entp would align with a campaigning/social type role.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese go against the general descriptions of these types as most descriptions are assuming that the reader is mainly mature in the main cognitive functions and have no competency in their tertiary and inferior function.\n\n&#x200B;
1	Never hold onto an ideal of something as your identity because those things are shallow at best and can be taken away. You have taken more responsibility for yourself in life and that is a good thing. Just focus on directing your being towards the greatest possible good that you can. Only your experience and your wisdom should show out who you really are the test just shows us how certain personality traits might be stronger then others but it is not who you are.
1	Okay, a couple thoughts.\n\nI don't think people just change types. I'm pretty sure you are what you are. What it sounds like happened is that you kicked into your third function, Te. This may be why you feel like more of a thinker now. ENFP's sometimes do this when we're avoiding connecting with our second function, Fi, because we don't want to slow down and focus on an introverted function as our natural direction is extroversion, so we use Te to make decisions instead of Fi. And actually, a lot of the changes you've made sound very "Te," that is, you're taking control of your external world, not that you're thinking about how things work more (Ti) which you would do as an ENTP. \n\nI have had the thought that I am an ENTP too, and I don't relate to everything on this subreddit, most of the posts are about relationship stuff and some memes and inspiration, but I honestly find the ENTP subreddit much more interesting personally. I don't think that if you like to think about how things work or if you care about your appearance that you are not an ENFP. \n\nI also think it says a lot that you are upset about being an ENTP. Not that MBTI is completely defined by choice or something, but I think the fact that you relate to and enjoy being an ENFP so much is pretty good evidence that you're an ENFP. Also, I think that sometimes people buy into the cliches of Myers briggs (including this subreddit, don't @ me) and just because you are an ENFP who has your shit together doesn't mean you're not an ENFP. \n\nI also think that Fi is actually a lot more calculating than people think it is, as many of the Fi doms that I know are people I originally thought were Ti users. Fi is very much about personal values and what is important to you, and this is not necessarily always warm and fuzzy and certainly not always scatterbrained. I think usually ENFPs that are all over the place haven't developed their Fi enough, and in fact in general I believe people who are unbalanced haven't developed their second function enough, because developing the second function gives you a more even balance between introvert and extrovert, as its important to connect with both yourself and reality, and a more even balance between judging and perceiving, as it is important to both make good decisions and yet be open to information.\n\n Lastly, many Myers briggs tests are somewhat skewed and rely on cliches and hints that you are a certain type. I've heard the only reliable way to type is to actually understand the cognitive functions and know what you are using, so are you coupling Fi or Ti with your Ne? Again, Fi can come off very calculating, it is just dependent on what you believe is right instead of what you believe is most logical. You can also google "ENTP vs ENFP" as that usually has some interesting and useful information.\n\nIf you do want to work on developing Fi, here are some resources:\n\n* [http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ENFP\_per.html](http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ENFP_per.html)\n* check out the personality hacker podcast, the episode where they talk about developing feeling as a copilot\n\nif you search around a bit, both of these resources have versions for ENTP's, so maybe you can just see which one you relate to more? also, the podcast is done by an ENTP and an ENFP (the guy's the ENFP, the woman's the ENTP) so maybe you can see which one you relate to more!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
5	Enfps: masters of the humble brag?	I honestly can't think of another type that so artfully is able to interject their accomplishments and status while somehow appearing humble. Thoughts?\n
11	I think it‚Äôs because we‚Äôre desperate to make everyone comfortable in our presence. So we reveal our accomplishments gently. We may introduce them nonchalantly or within a self deprecating comment. \n\nMeanwhile, in our own minds, we‚Äôre probably beaming with pride cause focus and follow through ain‚Äôt easy! 
1	What makes you say that?
1	I'm particularly great at this in any workplace situation. 
1	I agree. I realized early on that its important to mention one's accomplishments and I also *like* to talk about how I'm unique and interesting. BUT I despise when types do this in order to show superiority or to have others be in awe of them, and I don't want to do that. So any time I mention my accomplishments I also mention someone else's, or how others helped, or how I'm still not to where I want to be, or sometimes a flaw I am still working on. I want others to feel empowered that accomplishments aren't something that only superior people are capable of, and I hang out with some folks who unfortunately focus too much on their failures or areas where they haven't achieved success. I need to make it clear that I'm not perfect, but I also don't live in my mistakes. 
1	Hahaha, im not sure if its an enfp thing but im guilty üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
19	I'm easily put off by people who use self deprecation in order to be funny	First, let me say that I think humor is a good thing. Being able to laugh off tough situations can be healthy. Life can be rough and everyone has their own battles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut sometimes I just feel annoyed when people share memes that reflect negativity about their life. I understand that it helps to feel less alone by relating to other's struggles. Maybe I take things to heart too often as an ENFP, maybe I am too empathetic/sensitive, maybe I just let things get to me - I don't know. But I just feel that if people were a little more friendly and forgiving of themselves, we all wouldn't be so stressed out and anxious/depressed because things aren't perfect all the time.
7	I understand that it's a slippery slope. I do it on occassion but find myself rolling my eyes when I see memes on the internet about anxiety and depression. Too many people equate their whole selves to it, like they ARE anxiety and depression, PERIOD. The end. I think that's so detrimental to actually being able to grow in life. It's like a flower that slices itself at the stem. It genuinely frustrates me. In that case I think self depracatory humour can just be enabling.
6	I would rather have ppl joking about themselves rather than ppl joking about the others.
3	Lately i‚Äôve tried saying ‚Äúhey don‚Äôt talk about my friend that way‚Äù when someone puts themself down. Idk if people even realize how much it happens. I feel like the more secure in myself i am the more the people around me reflect that
2	Share with them what you said there at the end.
1	I am confident this is a Fi / Fe thing where a person with strong Fi and strong Fe (so the xxFx) feel this often.\n\nBut I am also confident this is strongest in the people with Strong Ne and weak Se (so the _N_Ps.)  Having Strong Ne and weak Se means you see all the different ways you could have expressed the thought easily, so why would you chose a combination you see as painful, this confuses you.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI totally heart you for having these sentiments and I get why this frustrates you.  I love self-deprecating humor in *some contexts* and hate it / loathe it in *other contexts.*\n\nI like being able to make fun of yourself in a gentle / loving / understanding way.  Recognizing your flaws, recongizing you have your own internal contradictions, and you are gentle with yourself.  Furthermore I love and adore gentle / loving / understanding teasing where you can gently rib love ones, friends, partners, family (but not strangers, not people you cooperate with in work, not people with a power imbalance with the relationship.)\n\nYet change the context of everything and the same behaviors in different contexts I see as one of the ultimate forms of cruelty.  Self-Depreciating humor can be a form of Mockery where you degenerate yourself, furthermore the same tools can be used to knife and shiv someone in the most cruel but elegant way possible.  Except to me this is not elegant this is instead **profane** and a form of **desecration.**\n\nBut hey this is my valued but inferior Se speaking.  I recognize context matter but I suck so much at context, yet I appreciate it so much when it is done right.
1	I feel you. I have this one friend who uses self deprecating jokes a lot, especially when somebody else has succeeded in doing something, and she‚Äôll just compare herself as a sack of potatoes or trash in comparison to them. But she always laughs after she says it, so I‚Äôm just like hmm...It makes me think perhaps she‚Äôs not confident enough, even though I think the world of her. 
1	I have many friends who do that as well. Sometimes, I find it funny, but most of the time I can sense that they truly feel like shit, and then I just want to help them feel better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy main advice for them is: **fake it 'till you make it**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you do have low self-esteem, it will be best for you to use over-powering, narcissist humour. By running the same gag, you will surely start to believe some yourself. 
1	Yes I think sometimes people are trying to make light of their insecurities or anxieties but that‚Äôs not always a good thing. It‚Äôs a fine line between knowing our flaws but also expressing our strengths and projecting ourselves in a strong positive manner that can be an encouragement to others.
1	I am curious what you think of this youtube video.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtj7LDYaufM\n\nThe subject of self deprivation comes up as topic 6 on this video essay (all the topics are connected though) and thus about 20:30.\n\nSidenote she mentions a famous ENFP comedian which you can love or hate (I have mixed feelings of him personally) George Carlin right before topic 6. (About 90 seconds before.)
40	Looks like something we'd do	
1	I don‚Äôt know why, but yes.
6	I feel crazy about this but yet totally fine	I'd say that I'm a very tolerant and patient person and I can take a lot of crap in my face without a flinch. But because of that people don't know that I remember quite a lot of things. And when they cross the line, I put them on "my list". And the list contains all those people who have crossed me so I can have my "revenge" when the time comes.\n\nI feel really insane about it, but I feel it like it's a part of me. Dafuq
4	I had this very strongly until a few years ago. Especially online I'd do this since I was pretty shy IRL at the time. I'm often perceived as forgetful, but when someone really crosses a line, I observe them for a while. I retained every little detail about them and thought of ways to use it against them. Most of the time it was pretty successful. It made me feel good about myself for a little while, but in the end I didn't really gain anything from it. I stopped that since it's pretty toxic behavior and you can really hurt people. If people cross a line of yours, repaying the exact same kind of thing (or even worse) makes you just as bad as them. Instead, you should be dismissive of such people. You won't hurt them directly and every single person hates being ignored, especially someone who thinks they can push your buttons. \n\nJust smile and wave boys, smile and wave.
3	Don't bother with your list and your revenge plans friend, the only thing you are achieving with this is wasting time on people who've hurt you. Fuck those people, just beacuse they're assholes doesn't mean you should be one.
3	Revenge won't make those people sorry for anything they did to you, just ignore them.
2	Dude that sounds so cringy. Your "list"? That does not sound like something someone can be serious about, it sound very childish. When someone crosses a line you cut them out of your life, that is an adult thing to do. The world is full of assholes and you need to learn how to deal with them. You getting your revenge on them won't make them feel sorry for their actions, they will just try to hurt you more. Speaking from experience, revenge is never worth it, just move on and forget about those who have hurt you, be better than them.
1	I actually sorta did this. And judging from my situation, you need to work on your insecurity and inferiority complex. üí©\n\nToday I just exclude certain people from my life to avoid getting bitter from being around them.
1	That doesn't sound like a healthy practice.
1	I think it‚Äôs fine to have boundaries, aka if someone hurts you then donmt be their friend. But i have never even attempted revenge. I don‚Äôt have time. Once you‚Äôre out of my life it‚Äôs all the way. I just act like those people don‚Äôt exist
3	I (ENFP), like my friend (INTJ)	At work there is this girl (INTJ) that I grew to like so much. She is beyond smart, she is funny and she is weird just like me. We hang out a lot outside of work. We both like the same things, we like chess, Skyrim, Archer, rock music and spicy food. When I am with her I feel like a thousand bucks, she brings so much joy to my life but as always there is a problem. The problem is that she doesn't feel the same way about me. When I asked her out she told me that she doesn't think that would be a good idea, she said that she has her own problems to deal with and that she would probably just end up hurting me. We still hang out and it's great but everytime I go home I feel broken. I'm not here looking for advice on how to get her, she said no and I resoect that, I'm here just to vent or something...I don't know, maybe some advice on how to deal with heartbreak could be useful. Has anyone here gone through something similair.
3	If you stick around and linger for her you're gonna see her with other guys and its gonna be a lot worse. 
4	I wouldn't take what she says as too significant.  She just shared some of her fears.  Aknowledge her fears, respect them and keep enjoying each other's company.\n\nMy advice is don't add too much significance to people's fears, they come and go.  Stick to what's important to you and keep pursuing her if that's what's really in your heart.\n\nIf you can be the kind of man she can't hurt - that's probably going to be ideal.  There is such a way to develop yourself that your expectations can't hurt you, by being open and honest.
2	Intj female here with an ENFP best friend (who i also happen to be romantically attracted to but that's another story). What she said doesn't sound like an outright "no" to me, just a "not right now". We intjs are pretty direct and say what we mean. It sounds like she's working through some personal issues or focusing on herself right now and that she would say "not right now" to anyone, not just you specifically.\n\n\nThe fact that she hangs out with you regularly shows me she at the very least values your friendship, which to from an intj is like being one of the select few chosen for the Fellowship. We don't have very many TRUE friends and the ones we do have we display a staggering amount of loyalty and devotion to.\n\n\nIt's possible when you asked her out that she hadn't even entertained the thought of a romantic relationship (we are incredibly oblivious to flirting) and said what she said in an effort to buy her some time to think about it without hurting you as best she could. It's possible she is still considering it and thinking about it. And it may take quite a while.\n\n\nKeep being your amazing ENFP self and amazing friend to her and cherish the moments you have together. If she doesn't want you to be a part of her life you would definitely know about it. And i dare say she would be sad to see you withdraw from her. \n\n\nIf you start to sense that maybe her life circumstances may have changed in a way that might make it more likely for you two to be romantically involved, feel free to bring it up again (carefully). Just be straightforward and calm and let her know that you really value her friendship and that you are happy to give her as much time as she needs. If she gives you a more firm dismissal at that point then I would take that as a firm no and not revisit the topic again. But hopefully you can still remain friends.
1	There is no advice anyone can give you on how to deal with a broken heart my friend, because the only thing that can help heal it is time.
1	INTJ (F) here.\n\nYou could stick around for a bit, if what she told you sounds like she‚Äôs unsure at the moment. \nI feel like to a certain extend, us INTJs like to see how far can someone hold out with us. The fact that she‚Äôs still hanging with you should mean something too...\nBut that said, if she was really clear in her stand, then not asking her the same question any further would be a wiser thing to do.
1	Why do I lose everyone?	Alright so I‚Äôve actually never been typed as an ENFP but I believe this may be my type as I‚Äôm rather emotional (but I hate that). I always am typed as ENTP.\n\nAnyways I recently saw a post on the ENTP sub about ENFPs and their flaws. Frankly I related a lot which is what convinced me to come over here. \n\nThis post is for people who maybe struggle with the same issues because we‚Äôre the same type, and if they have any advice.\n\nAs someone who is struggling pretty harshly I have turned to the oh so wise reddit. \n\nRecently I had a nightmare, I‚Äôve been having them for a while. I‚Äôm just the exact kind of person I hate in it, or I‚Äôm acting like myself. \n\nI woke up and realized I can‚Äôt seem to keep friends. Anyone who I see outside of school or work ends up disliking me or becoming apathetic towards me, and only hanging out in groups where I‚Äôm more of a human joke. I‚Äôm never anyone‚Äôs first choice. I‚Äôve never had a best friend and now I think I know why.\n\nI have a lot going on in my head and communicating genuinely is really difficult. I feel like I plan every expression and action to have an intended impact and it isn‚Äôt working. It‚Äôs more my nature to masquerade as different personalilities or attitudes for short interactions. \n\nI don‚Äôt have any respect among close friends, they all kind of see me as a sham who tries too hard and really just invite me because they like my twin. I‚Äôm beginning to despise myself so much I have nightmares. I want to rid myself of an attention seeking nature or whatever this is. \n\nIf anyone has tips for being less... well any of these. If they struggle with the same things.\n\nI want to be a person of substance, confidence. I shoot to be the kind of person who doesn‚Äôt care, but I don‚Äôt know how. I‚Äôm starting to think maybe meds are the answer? Something to just kind of lightly sedate me constantly. 
4	When you find your passion, you will find your tribe. When ENFPs find obsessions (activities that others call hobbies hah), we dig deep into the community. We want to do our best and be in the midst of the best. Likewise, people are attracted to our passion, effort and potential. \n\nSo please keep exploring. The ones you‚Äôve lost along the way won‚Äôt matter as much when you finally connect with your people. 
3	You really have to accept yourself.  And forgive yourself for all these feelings and make wrongs.\n\nYou're 10x harder on yourself than anyone will ever be on you.  And no one is thinking about you even 1% of what you think, they're too busy worrying about themselves.\n\nThe more you focus on pleasing the people who judge you the more you play into their game.\n\nBe yourself.  Do your own thing. Gravitate towards the people who appreciate you.
2	If you find you are at a loss as to how you are to conduct yourself through life and relate to other people, you may have already touched upon it. The most important thing to have a life that is one of substance and that is trying to attain the greatest possible good is that you have to learn what it really means to be a fundamentally honest person who tells the truth. For example trying to show a facade of yourself to others is not an honest way of presenting yourself to others and as you have discovered is quite shallow. Think very carefully about how you conduct yourself. Do you say things merely as a way to pursuade people to your own side? You need to be able to trust your faculties and if you are not telling the truth enough your mind will doubt your own ability to navigate yourself. So build a foundation of honesty within yourself that is a good place to start. It‚Äôs a hard thing to hear but a good thing when things aren‚Äôt going well and it just might be our own fault but that‚Äôs ok because then that also means it‚Äôs within our ability to fix it. So look to yourself first and foremost and begin fixing what needs fixing. 
2	Your dreams are an abstract construct of whatever you fear in your life the monster so to speak can sometimes be your own self, your failures your weaknesses but your capacity to overcome that is far greater. Stop facing life with your head down and look at life like it is a dragon to slay and your the knight to do it. Stand up and get your shoulders back, embody those traits that you admire in a hero it‚Äôs so important that you change your mindset.
2	The people who dont stick around are ones that probably don't really compliment you, and if they were to stick around they may even end up being toxic to you. Trust me when you find those friends who you really connect with, they'll stick around. They're just hard to find when you dont like yourself.\n\nIn high school I definitely felt like a black sheep who was just this spazzy weirdo who couldn't make friends. This honestly made me pretty petty and bitter towards people and honestly I think I was so deep in my negative mindstate I was pushing people away before they had a chance to leave me first. \n\nAs I grew older and focused on the things that made me happy, I just naturally attracted people who also enjoyed that thing that made me happy, and before you know it you're doing happy things together. You really do attract what you are.
2	Hey man, good to see you've got some insight in the situation. Maybe you're having a rough day and it's not really that bad, but these feelings are an indicator that you should do some changes anyway.\n\nI'm tired and have had a joint. But I think people usually give too vague answers, let me give some concrete advice and see if it resonates with you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConfidence: You need some sense of achievement, and you need to disattach from relying on other peoples validation. If you're constantly seeking validation you will not get it. But the reason you stop relying on other peoples validation is because you truly dont need their validation. YOUR brain is one of natures finest machines and you can trust your own conscience to lead you to know right and wrong.\n\nYou don't know everything, and will of course listen to others, critically weigh what they're saying and their credibility while remaining respectful, but through bettering yourself you will learn to trust and love yourself.\n\nHow?\n\nThere are sort of two parts here. We are all unique unicorns and all that glittery shit, we have different needs. But we're all flesh and blood, and we need good nutrition, tasty food, clean air, physical activity, social interaction, to LEARN something (, arguably also we should run longer distances, walk barefeet, participate in playing music, and express ourselves through art or other creative intances. But just look past the paranthesis if that doesn't resonate with you.)  \nAnd to feel good in body in mind, you have to meet some of these. You have to build a lifestyle that stimulates these areas.\n\nAnd also you are a beautiful unicorn with a nuance of color no one else has. What are your personal passions? Computer programming, speed walking, training dogs, writing music, learning a new language or three? Whatever it is, you should take your passions and every need i listed in the last paragraph and figure out how you can integrate this in your life in a way that is pleasurable to your needs and personality, but still takes you out of your comfort zone and ensures your growth.\n\nRemember not to do everything on one day, almost all great things are results of small choices every day. So you just have to get a little better every day. Start with a plan for what you want to do, what you need to do short term and long term to get there, and incorporate more and more every week/month. Start doing one or two things the first week. Maybe you make a couple extra homemade meals and take three hours to learn guitar. Then you do the same next week and also take a run tuesday and thursday morning. This is just an example, do something that takes you closer to a goal that makes you smile and feel warm when you really think about it.And when you're feeling shitty cause all of these new things remind you what kind of person you are not, remember that the change has just started. The seed has just been sown. You are a little sprout, and a sprout is just as it should be. It's being a sprout, doing excactly what it's supposed to do, and it's perfect. As long you keep growing, you are perfect now matter how small you are.\n\nHere you follow your intuiton. I feel I need to listen to weird foreign music and do freestyle sessions every morning to improve my rapping skills, so I incorporate that into my schedule. You know what you need to do.\n\nIf you're struggling with the motivation, PM me and I'll help you. :-)\n\nOn friends: Keep your appointments, make regular contact with the people you want to keep contact with, make sure you're a friend worth having - do stuff for your friends, make small sacrifices when needed, be there for them when they're downAnd maybe especially for ENFPs:Don't interrupt people (more than they interrupt you), try and balance your energy levels, understand that people are not always on your level, people can think life is chill when you think it is absolutely horrible and people don't have to cheer up when you are extatic, don't always relate to everything everyone tells you all the time. It's a great way to connect to people, but not ALL THE TIME. And don't take over the entire group. I used to sorta take over at times when I was in groups and wasn't invited again until I learned that being "humble" was a thing.And speaking of humble, don't speak yourself down to be funny unless people actually laugh at these jokes. And don't whine to people, choose a few people who are there for you who you can vent to. Cause people will just associate you with negativity.\n\nAnd make sure you guard your friends needs! And dont be needy.\n\nAight I hope you got something out of this, I just lost track of thought so I guess that's it ;-)\n\nGood luck man/girl\n\nEdit: This comment needed some urgent care to make sense. Will probably come back when rested. 
3	What makes you certain you're an ENFP, and not any other personality types?	
4	Because I cringe from most of the posts on this page like they‚Äôre different horrible alternative versions of myself, almost like that Scrooge Christmas Ghost film.\n\nThat was maybe a bit harsh. But Jesus, I thought there‚Äôd be discussion on objective versus subjective thinking, the influence and function of art in human evolution, and sharing of ideas and dreams and what not.\n\nI like this post though üòú
4	No other type description feels right. Occasionally I considered ENTP/INFP but I'm too considerate for ENTP and too extraverted for INFP.
3	Doubting my own personality type
2	I discovered MBTI at 41 by accident, never heard about it before, I already knew most of myself. When I took the test I realized that it was me at 99% (let‚Äôs keep open option). I‚Äôve read the posts here, the survival guide, articles etc... almost everything I read about ENFP happened in my life more than once, same feelings, thoughts and doubts.\n\nSo I‚Äôm very confident about being ENFP.
2	Because i've gone through thinking I was several different ones, and each time after a couple weeks I'd realize something that was seemingly vital to the experience of those types was missing in me. Then I dove deeper and would discover a new one that resonated more strongly. I got better at understanding who I am and not just who I thought I was or who I was pretending to be.\n\nAnd when confronted with the most recent "huh, maybe I'm not ENFP, maybe I'm x type" I dove into it and was like "nope, that's further from the truth". \n\nAlso understanding the cognitive functions and not just reading type descriptions. I knew this much to be true, I'm not strong in either Si or Se. So it cut out all the SJs and SPs pretty much, even though i've realized how being in an Si grip can imitate being one of those types (i forget which one for me). \n\nThen I realized I had strong Ne, like very strong Ne. So it boiled down to one of the 4 NP types. I realized I definitely don't lead with Fi and that my Fi was likely under-developed due to my upbringing (if I even have Fi in the top 2), so i ruled out INFP. Accepting that I lead with Ne ruled out INTP. So its really down to ENFP or ENTP, which is a common issue for both types. \n\nSo its either Fi and Te or Ti and Fe. I also knew that I was inclined to think of myself as an NT and needed to not project that idea of myself anymore. I didn't get anywhere thinking about Fi/Fe because i'm so fucked in that way, but Ti/Te difference was more clear. Ti wants to understand, Te wants to apply. Obviously one needs to understand things to apply Te, and obviously someone with Ti will apply their understanding, but whats the focus? I find that I lose interest in gathering knowledge when I reach that point where I can apply that knowledge in my life. theres always more to learn about any given topic, it just doesn't interest me if I don't see how its applicable. \n\nSo, I'm an ENFP. One with a stronger Te than Fi but whose been able to tap into that Fi the more i've been on this journey. 
1	Doubting my personality type and appearing to be on drugs when completely sober. \n\nAlso I'm told that I'm a more stoic Andy Dwyer. Hell yeah, bitch. 
1	I'm not sure lol
3	Not as good as a speaker?	I think I either stay quiet or I talk a lot depending on whether I want to or not\n\nAnd then when it comes to talking in general...\n\nMy sentences don't feel as 'fluid'. Like it feels like my mind is going faster than my actual speech, and it's like I'm talking in a wiggly shape. But people seem to think I'm fun and random, so it works, I suppose\n\nMy thoughts are far more eloquent than my writings or my speech. Can anyone relate?
1	I get it! I often have to practice certain phrases so they seem natural once I actually speak them. We‚Äôre big picture thinkers, it comes naturally. Breaking the big idea down for ‚Äúnormal‚Äù speech is something we have to work at. 
1	If it's something you want to develop I suggest taking self expression classes, Toastmasters, Landmark education, etc.. etc..\n\nPlenty of places out there to develop speaking and self-expression, which is vital for an ENFP's growth imo.
5	My ex of 4 years tried to tell me he feels sorry for me because I live with such hate and anger....	And I‚Äôm like BITCH?? Clearly you never, ever knew me‚Äîyou wolf in sheep‚Äôs clothing!!! Sometimes I fart rainbows and sunshine. I‚Äôm always giggling at something silly. I‚Äôll do just about anything to make people giggle as well. My friends always tell me how I lift them up and make them happy when they‚Äôre down. I am always silly and random and bouncing on a little cloud of happiness and giggles.... but you know what? I guess I must have lost some of that while dating his soul sucking ass. It‚Äôs crazy to think someone lives so entitled that they can give 20% while the other (me) gave 80% AND COMPLAIN. Oh hell naw. New relationship is on the horizon and BABY this bubbly bouncy scatterbrain can not wait for the new adventures.\n\nBACK ON DA HAPPY TRAIN PEEPz. Boing boing boing boooinnnggggg. 
3	Our ENFP "hate" is an extension of our strong and direct passions. We get especially worked up when someone attacks other people--we defend others before we defend ourselves. Sometimes this passionate defense will get misinterpreted as hate for the attacker, because we're pretty in your face about how we feel. It's PASSION not ANGER that's being observed...

1	when a bear drinks beer it becomes unbeerable.	You‚Äôre just too distant for my arms. Maybe you‚Äôre too far for my hugs. Could my imagination be as long to reach you somewhere and taste you? I don‚Äôt know what I really feel. I wonder what you think about me, if you're cold enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wake up at night and cry fucked up. I'm still afraid of the dark. Gosh i‚Äôd do anything to have some flan now. but I'm very scared that something grabs me from under the bed if I put one foot on the floor. why you far flan?
1	What is your opinion on INTJs and ENTPs?	I don't know why but it always seems like us ENFPs are falling for INTJs and it always seems like we can't get along with ENTPs. Maybe this is just my expirience but I would love to hear what you guys think about this.
2	I don't have an ENTP who's close to me but there's an INTJ (male) whom I absolutely adore. He's hardworking and capable and all and yet also so quirky and awkward that he's just absolutely adorable. I'm not sure but I think INTJs need to take their time getting used to people and once they do, they're just soo loveable. 
1	My longest relationship was with a slightly older female ENTP. We were best friends and lovers for a decade. Not sure if I've met an INTJ but online they seem a little uninspired but have refreshing wit. 
1	I actually love ENTPs so much !!! They‚Äôre one of my favourite types to be friends with (I‚Äôd never be in a relationship with one). They really get me and are so much fun to argue with!! Soooo much fun to argue with- and I usually hate arguing, but they have so much energy and make it so interesting!! And they‚Äôre so talkative and knowledgeable about their subject areas... I mean... they‚Äôre just great, intellectual people. I always love meeting ENTPs !! Genuinely \n\nINTJs üòÇüòÇ they‚Äôre such sweeties when they open their heart to you. And they‚Äôd do anything for the people they care about and they genuinely work so hard at their passions. They are hidden gems, as you wouldn‚Äôt know what treasure lies beneath that hard exterior!! They‚Äôre adorable! My boyfriend is an INTJ!! 
1	I need some advice	I don't know a lot about mbti, I'm new to all this. Me and my friends took the test about a month ago and found that the types we got described us well. I am ENFP, my friends got ISTP, ENTJ, ESFJ and ENTP. I need some advice on how to deal with my ENTP friend. He is...well he's an asshole. He is one of the smartest peoole I've ever met, he loves to debate and god he's good at it. The only thing he is better at is being an asshole. He insults me every chance he gets, he has no respect for my privacy, my property or me as a person. One time he took my phone without my knowledge and took screenshots of messages between me and my girlfriend at the time with whom I've been arguing, he send those screenshots to himself and then he send them from his phone to pretty much everyone of our friends. There is also the time when I told him about this girl that I liked and he procceeded to ask here out, and she said yes and for those 3 weeks they were together he kept describing the sex to me and all the things they did to each other. Know he somehow found my post on reddit from my old account from 2 years ago where I admited to having depression and of course he send it to pretty much everyone. I just don't know how to deal with him anymore. My ENTJ and ESFJ friends like this guy more than they like me, and every time I tried to tell them that I don't want to hang out with him anymore they sided with him saying " oh, that's just what he's like". My ISTP friend told me that ENTP friend hates me because he thinks that I am stupid. Like what the fuck are you five fucking years old. My friends like him so much beacuse he is a fun person to be around, there is always something interesting going on, he is always the life of the party, the last man standing, the cool guy who is good at everything. I just don't know how to cut him out of my life without losing my other friends, I know I said that two of them always side with him but even so they tell him when he is being an asshole to me, they try to help me but they won't leave him because he is never a jerk to them. What should I do?
2	Honestly, I've dealt with a similar situation. My friends also seemed to like another guy more, and I felt under-appreciated. From what you're saying, I believe you should reconsider finding new friends. People who love and support you would not tolerate a person being so immature, and straight out mean, EVEN when they are not the object of mockery.\n\nI don't get why they cannot hang out with you without him though.\n\nPerhaps it is best for you to find new friends. Maybe consider distance yourself from them and see if it changes anything.
1	You might consider not hanging out with them when your ENTP friend is with them. You could also invite them out when you know the ENTP dude can't go or just simply don't invite him. Also block your ENTP friend on all social media.
1	Sorry to say this, but if your friends are siding with that bully, they are not really your friends. I've met a lot of ENTPs and they always seem to be assholes but your friend is on whole other level of assholnes.
1	Im guessing that the entp friend is the leader of the pack. This reminds me of many of my past experiences. In those cases there was a common theme that i found. From what you described i think he is afraid of you. Specifically i think he feels challenged by you for the leadership role of the friend group. I could be wrong but let me know if you want more detail.
1	I think you need less drama in your life.\n\nI have an friend who just called me expressing similar issues with a business partner, this friend of mine has taken a LOT of personal development classes.  He told me how he just dealt with the business partner head on with his tantrums, expressed it wasn't working for him and made some requests or their partnership would be over.\n\nThe dude got it, started showing him some respect, then asked my friend to promote to a higher position.\n\nThe way you're dealing with the situation doesn't sound like it's working.  To come at it from a direction that will have it work - be authentic with the intention of restoring power to your friendships.
1	It‚Äôs up to you what to do but this person does not act like your friend. You seem to respect them but they have utterly no respect for you & they seem to be going out of their way to hurt you. If it were me anyone of those things he has done would make me cut him out of my life, i‚Äôm surprised you‚Äôve given him so many chances. If your friends don‚Äôt see how disrespectful he is to you then they are enabling him & this pattern will continue
1	Dump him, he is a trash.
1	To beat a monster you have to become a monster yourself. I think enfp is super high in the personality trait agreeableness and unfortunately it makes less compassionate types easily roll right over you. You have to work at the things that are weak at which in this case is the ability to be confrontational. You simply need to learn that it‚Äôs ok to fight back and stand up for yourself. A bunny rabbit isn‚Äôt virtuous, a bunny gets eaten. A virtuous person is someone who has a sword and knows how to use it but with wisdom knows when to draw it. Life will be a lot easier if you can learn to be disagreeable to some extent it will not jeopardize your personality I assure you.
252	My ENTJ husband... And me	
18	Hahaha. I actually have 2 ENTJ friends. One is deeply spiritual, he's cool. He has no idea to handle emotions though, but I can laugh at it. \n\nWe were calling once and I was sad because of a break up and he's like...\n\n"I think she still loves you and misses you too."\n\nMe: no she doesn't, she says she doesn't want me anymore. It's over. \n\n"No no, she was caring last time I spoke with her."\n\nMe: that was a month ago though. She's moved on since. \n\n"Well it has been 4 months since you broke up, maybe you should move on too?"\n\nMe: but it hurts I'm sad I miss her we broke up because of life craziness it wasn't our fault it created a horrible chain of events \n\n"You should come hangout with the French girls you introduced me too."\n\nMe: I'm so sad. \n\n"I think you should go play your game." \n\nMe: what game?\n\n"The game you were first playing when you broke up."\n\nMe: Fortnite?\n\n"Yes I think it will help. Go play some fortnite."\n\nWhen me and my ex first broke up I told him I was coping by playing lots of fortnite while crying hahaha. \n\nAs emotionless as he can be it's all good.\n
9	The 'no fun' is real with some xNTJs.  I swear though, getting one to crack and accidentally smile when I'm being stupid goofy is prized more than the cheap belly laughs I get from people like me lol. Most xNTJs won't usually laugh with me unless we're watching really witty or dark stand up/sketch comedy.
15	Ugh, I want to marry an ENTJ, they are so amazing
5	Bahahahahahahhaha this is my brother and sister! Nailed it.
2	Haha you're right
2	What's it like to be married to one?
2	My girlfriend is ENTJ. I don't know how you married one. This annoyance at my personality is draining.

65	How to grow as an ENFP	
11	This is great. Thank you. (;\n\nWe need more posts like this!
4	I don't understand #4 smelling a flower or reviewing my morning routine to give me comfort?
3	I love this! So useful! :D
2	Lol someone asked how to improve the 4 ENFP functions and I said basically most pf these things.
1	Teaching	I've been training to teach in secondary schools since September, I have a mountain to climb before I get to the standard I want myself to be in my new profession. Recently though the work load is taking over my life, and I've become more irritable with friends and family. It's taking its toll on my personal relationships and the relationship I have with myself... I feel like I need to either push through and ignore the difficulties or quit and mend the damage it's causing outside of schoool.\n\nAre there any ENFPs out there who can give me some advice?
1	Make lots of time for yourself. You may have to cut something out of your lofe to carve in more alone time. And then use it to get shit down/veg out/ or take long showers (something makes you feel good)
10	ENFP and struggling with an identity crisis	I feel like I'm just a blank piece of paper with no traits that are.... uniquely me.\n\nMore often than not, I feel like I'm just a shapeless playdoh - I can fit into most social circles, I can be engaging and have a fun conversation, but something's missing. Each time I walk away from a social gathering I just feel so much more lonely because I can't seem to create a genuine connection or relationship with someone. Maybe it's because to build a relationship, it takes much more than just a good conversation... But I can't seem to bring myself to put in the effort; not that I don't want to, but rather I don't think I have much to offer. What if this person realizes that I'm just that shallow, repetitive person? oh gosh this post is so negative \n\nbut yeah if you guys have any tips, do share!
8	You are trying to make every conversation pleasant but that is not how to really be deep and genuine. Sometimes you have to say things that others might not all agree with, or some might not approve of. Be yourself. Stand up for your beliefs. If you feel you have no beliefs you need to work on building your Fi, getting connected to you.\n\nTo build Fi: be more decisive to get in touch with what you really want and who you are. Don't ever say "Whatever" or "I don't care" or "You decide" when presented with something. Make choices. Even if one choice is only a millimeter more in your mind pick it. This will help you at making all decisions and knowing your values deeper and better. And don't let anyone treat you like a doormat. Be confident in yourself and your opinions.\n\nYou don't make friends by pleasing everyone. Because if you try to please everyone you end up pleasing no one.
3	Every time when you are in one of these smaller groups, you will find yourself a color. The more groups you are in, the more colors you'll have. It's up to you to take those colors and paint something out of it.\n\nI've seen artists take their children's sloppy artwork and turn that into something beautiful. You are basically going to have to do something similar here. Start off by throwing slabs of paint onto your canvas, then readjust to create a masterpiece.\n\nPoint is, being in many groups gives you freedom to explore who you are. It opens you to opportunities to experiment whether you like this or not. Each time you face an experience, it will shape you, regardless if it was good or not. It's up to you to learn from it and grow. It's up to you to make your masterpiece :)
2	I've been here before. You're definitely not alone. There's some great advice here in regards to standing up/building your beliefs, and you should definitely do that, but I have something else to add to this thought.\n\nFeeling like a person without a "group", "tribe", or "identity" can in a sense become an identity in and of itself. I used to desperately search for where I belonged. I latched on to aspects of my friends' personalities or cultures and tried to feel as though I was a part of them, but it always felt empty. It took me stepping back, realizing I didn't fit into any of these subsets, and ***being okay*** with that in order to really be myself.\n\nNow? I love that I'm a bit of a chameleon. Being able to walk into any given circle and get along with most people is something to be proud of. You're a floater, and that's okay. Unlike some people, your connections with others aren't going to come from your identity, but rather from you being a good, kind, and loving person to those you care about. \n\nI have an almost overwhelming amount of casual "friends", and I definitely understand what you mean about feeling empty after walking away from those social gatherings. To counteract that, I started spending more time with a small-close-knit circle, usually in a setting where we can just sit and talk with each other. You have to find the right people for this, and it's not going to be instant. Bonds are formed over a long period of time for most people. It'll happen though, as long as you're directing your attention and consideration towards people who appreciate it.\n\nThe best advice I can give you right now is to be deliberate with your friendships. If you meet someone that really stands out, talk to them outside of gatherings or parties, **actively listen** to the things they share with you about their lives, and bring those things up again next time you see them. Show you care about the people they are, and if they're the right ones they'll return that. \n\nThere's more to you than you're letting on, even if you can't see it right now, and they'll probably notice it before you do.
1	Almost this same topic was shared a few days ago, here's the discussion!:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/at7wqi/do\_you\_ever\_feel\_so\_undefined\_that\_youre\_almost/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/at7wqi/do_you_ever_feel_so_undefined_that_youre_almost/)\n\nMy tip would be practice standing up for what you really want.  Stop tolerating things in your life you don't really want.  You know what they are because they are not aligned with your values and you constantly make them and yourself wrong for being in those situations.\n\nExample, I used to work in low quality TV movies.  I put my foot down and am discovering being a quality salesperson, which has nothing to do with movies.  It was a slow painful transition but damn was it worth it to stand up for what I really care about.
2	Interpersonal ENFP advice for work, and your experiences, do people make you feel like a misunderstood black sheep?	Looking for some constructive advice on how i can stop the paranoia and negative self talk. This is mainly about my job.\n\nLittle about my role, i work in projects in telco. Been at this current company for 2 years now as a contractor. I work for a international company and there are probably about 60 people on my floor roughly.\n\nI sit in an open office environment and two people who in particular don't like me, moved me from my team and sat me next to upper management (we work in a hot desk situation). Which made me feel like a child. \nI sit here every day, with my headphones in, it makes people more comfortable around me I've noticed. Most days I'm not even listening to anything.\n\nI constantly feel ostracised as i only have 3 or 4 people i consider my friends here (not on the same floor).  I love people and getting along with everyone, but its defintiely not reciprocated. \n\nIts so disheartening to try for this long and still be treated this way. I know my faults believe me, i sit there and try to justify how they must feel when i try to talk with them. I never get invited to group drinks, functions, lunch etc. When i have in the past it gives me so much anxiety because i feel like I'm not meant to be there (work drinks), i end up getting way to drunk (then bailing) just so i can handle being there, which normally doesn't really end well either (last time i woke up with several indoor plants and soil in my backpack).\n\nLook i know I'm a bit fucked, i got issues, but I'm aware of it and try consciously to not let this effect people around me or in my life. And yes I'm seeing a psychologist.\n\nEvery damn day i find a struggle, i feel broken coming home from a job that makes me feel invisible, worthless, and with a bad reputation i dont know how to shake. I cant even defend myself because i will just come across as extra. \n\ni numb myself with weed when i get home so i can give my head a break from the relentless negative thoughts and feedback i give myself via inner monologue each day. \n\nI found out last week that along with 4 others I've been fired. But i was lucky, there were two people who noticed how i was never given a chance on the team and got me placed elsewhere in the company.  It was a blessing in disguise. But so grateful. I feel like everyone around me thinks that I don't deserve the opportunity. They made a point of keeping Another coordinator who has no experience, and its his first job out of uni, who by the way, i still consistently fix his work.  \n\nI feel like I've been going crazy the last few months.. i knew they were going to get rid of me but kept it from me. I have consistently asked for feedback, more work, and performance reviews. None of which i have ever recieved in the time i have been here. Oh right sorry, no i did get feedback -  when they ended my contract.\n\nRight now i have to sit in this purgatory with all these people who don't want anything to do with me. I can't speak, because I've had feedback that people think I'm weird and that i say strange things. I feel like a sitting duck waiting for the people who wanted me gone to catch on i still have a job and try to ruin it for me.. every morning I walk in waiting to be called in to be told they've changed their minds. \n\nI know, you're thinking, NEW JOB\nI agree, and I'm trying, really. But i can't afford to not be employed and i can't just quit without having a plan B. \n\nThis is going to sound crazy, but do you ever feel like you can feel other peoples emotions towards you, but sometimes it gets confused as your own? Some of the horrible things i think about myself just don't even seem like my thoughts. I think this is why i get so overwhelmed, externally nothing is happening but internally I'm being thrown to the wolves. \n\nI'm really hoping this entire event was a catalyst to bring something beautiful into my life, a new opportunity, bosses who care, where i am respected and people can see my value. But most importantly having some friends that enjoy my strange personality not condemn it.\n\nThanks for reading, and I'm sorry probably should have put a warning on it \n\nHas anyone else had negative experiences at work due to their personality? Please tell me your stories 
1	Nah you're feeling this way because deep down you know you're unstoppable and it kills you to pretend being anything but.\n\nEmbraced your full unstoppableness and people will resonate with you like nobody's business.  Try it on.
8	My coworker made a meme out of my boomerang. Spot on üòÅ	
34	Why are my relationships/friendships so shaky?	I don't understand why it keeps happening over and over again.I meet someone great and then I end up getting taken for granted or feel disrespected and then I get hurt over something.Before I know it, it's over.I get attached fast and then I keep thinking about it till time and work takes my mind off it.I just want a normal and functioning friendship/relationship other than my parents.
16	You said it yourself.  You get attached too fast.  
16	You should focus on understanding why this happens before you get into another relationship. 
6	I have the same issues. I have to consciously tone it down for most of my relationships to work. We are naturally clingy and it pushes people away 
7	> I get attached fast\n\nThis is probably part of it. Most people you date aren't going to be the ones you end up with, so knowing that and treating dating as a trial rather than assuming each person could be the one might help reframe it. It also might help prevent you putting so much energy into that person right away and being disappointed when they don't do the same (which is not necessarily them taking you for granted but rather seeing you as a new person they're still getting to know and aren't super attached to yet).\n\nI understand because it's a habit of mine too and has left me feeling super down in the past. I am a nurturer/helper by nature and tend to give a lot in my friendships/relationships right off the bat, so tempering my expectations has helped me stop being so hurt when other people don't approach relationships quite the same way.
5	Is a relationship really over, or you believe it's over?\n\nSometimes, we ENFPs just overthink every little thing and feel abandoned. Try to look at people with one eye open.
9	Probably because you don‚Äôt use the space bar in between sentences. 
5	Look up anxious-preoccupied attachment style. Actually, watch this video on it:\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=f6iTlX2IR6U\n\nCause tbh I‚Äôve been there üòÇüòÇ I‚Äôm slowly healing \n
3	I was just wondering this. I rub people the wrong way if I‚Äôm myself .I‚Äôm not very shy and super opinionated. Im not very agreeable and i will counter someone‚Äôs opinions if that have a better argument. I suck at formulating arguments on the spot but i can know I‚Äôm right. This gives off the vibe that i just talk but don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm saying. I bet a lot of feelers can relate to this. When you aren‚Äôt as quick with logic, people will lose patience and if you‚Äôre too quick people will lose patience ugh. Peopling is hard and if you want to fit in you have to hide parts of yourself or just expect less 
2	Meet someone ‚Äúgreat‚Äù who takes you for granted or makes you FEEL disrespected..?\n\nYou sound like a pessimistic person, and a victim. I am married to an ENFP (f), and I work with her on this constantly. One of the biggest humps to get over is learning how to self reflect, and take responsibility for YOUR flaws. Also, did they make you FEEL disrespected while ‚Äúcriticizing‚Äù you on something? Because as many enfp are self aware that they get all fired up and defensive when they‚Äôre being criticized. One cannot grow in a relationship without listening to the others ‚Äúcriticisms‚Äù constructively, and trying to find middle ground. \n\nBest of luck! I‚Äôm sure you are an amazing person, do not give up hope.. you‚Äôll find someone, sometimes you personally are just not ready yet. 
1	You need to find some mature INTJs \~ \~ \~
2	Weekly Support Thread	\n/r/ENFP has always been and will always be a place that lends an ear. Large or small, get it all off your chest. In this corner of the internet, you will be heard. We are here to support one another. We are all we have.\n\nThis doesn't replace the individual posts; it's just another avenue to start talking, MBTI related or not. Sometimes you need to check in more than once before you feel restored. That's what we're here for.\n
5	How do you improve each of your cognitive functions & become your best self? (Ne, Fi, Te, Si)	1. How do you improve Ne?\n\n2. How do you improve Fi?\n\n3. How do you improve Te?\n\n4. How do you improve Si?
7	Just my thoughts.\n\nNe: do creativity exercises,  stretch your imagination. One fun one is imagine a spoon and try to think of as many other ways you can use it besides for eating. do this with many things, what ways can they be different? Think of the future and try to imagine different ways the world will go.\n\nFi: be more decisive to get in touch with what you really want and who you are. Don't ever say "Whatever" or "I don't care" or "You decide" when presented with something. Make choices. Even if one choice is only a millimeter more in your mind pick it. This will help you at making all decisions and knowing your values deeper and better.\n\nTe: do organization puzzles and work on efficiency. Try to get things to fit in a place a certain way. Organize your closet, your room, your apartment/house. Also try to be more assertive. Don't let others use you as a floor-mat, be more vocal about things. Be more confident in yourself and your decisions. Set little goals and achieve them. Reward yourself when you get something done. Then do bigger goals. But still little ones too. Little goals make up big ones.\n\nSi: try to set routines, like Te this will also help get stuff done. For example if you want to write set a routine that every day you'll write for an hour and not let anything distract you. Put a timer. Also learn the value of simple every day routines, like washing dishes. These things allow you to relax and think on things calmly.
1	Confidence	Hi friends! \n\nHow many of you ENFPs are confident - dating, work, life direction, etc.?\n\nDo you think other people perceive you as confident? Do other mbti personality types perceive us as confident?\n\nI feel like when we are talking about our passions we can be extremely confident and that is what gives us charisma. What do you think?
7	Extremely outwardly confident in all areas but internally pretty fragile. 
2	I think we are more confident than we realize, and a lot of that confidence is just a willingness to assert ourselves and talk. Some other types are really shy about talking *at all*. We are shy about talking about our depths though, but are masters at turning it around and asking questions of others. \n\nI can't say I'm confident in general. I have a massive case of imposter syndrome at work. I don't know "who I am". I am doing the online dating thing. So I can say, I'm not a confident person. \n\nBut I do believe in myself, whatever that may be. I do believe I'm capable of anything I put my mind and heart into, and have the proof. So whatever confidence I lack in the more micro aspects of my life, I make up for in a macro-level confidence. If that makes sense at all.  
2	I believe that I am generally confident in all aspects of my life. The area that could use the most work in terms of confidence is my dating life.\n\nI think confidence is MBTI independent and more personally dependent. Confidence is gained through the experiences we face, and the amount of audacity we put into learning from them, both good and bad. \n\nMany people see me as confident because I rely on my past experiences to back up what I know to be right for everyone and for myself. This doesn't mean that I'm always right, because I didn't experience everything that life can offer me. This is why I look at other people's experiences, and see how they are able to utilize that to make decisions for everyone.\n\nMy confidence outshines when I target my passions in life. This is because I am willing to sacrifice all the time in the world to pursue that passion based on love. The more time spent, the more experiences gained, and the more confident you become. It's all about developing great experiences  and learning from them.
19	I feel like lots of ENFPs blame their ENFP attributes for their incapability and irresponsibility	Being an ENFP can be a positive/ creative thing. You have lots of ideas than other people, you tend to be more charming. If you are incapable and irresponsible that has to do with yourself not your ENFP-ness. 
8	I agree more or less. People take the downsides of the personality as an excuse not to work on them, when actually they should take MBTI, just as anything else that gives you insight into your mind, like shining a flashlight onto your negative sides and improve your weaknesses. \n\nLike... Not good at following through? Yeah, that's an tendency in ENFP. Now get to work improving that Te, you can find guides on the internet that will help you do that. If you decide to just stay where you are and go "teehee, i'm an ENFP, that's part of my charm", that's on you.
4	ENFP-ness (heh)
3	Guinea pigs rape each other.\n\nOh I thought we were saying true statements that people don‚Äôt really want to hear.
2	I agree 
4	Uh, ok. Did you come here just  to get that off your chest?   \n\nI hope you feel better now and that you get over whatever it is that hurt you. 
1	It can, but everyone has their achillies 
1	I mean, I think its both. Like, ENFP's have similar strengths and similar weaknesses. So like your specific brand of incompetence is based on your ENFP-ness. So but then work on being more competent.
1	One of the things ENFP's are known for is making excuses and lieing to themselves, so yeah.. sounds pretty ENFP to me.
11	So ENTPs hate us haha	
20	Lol I don't really care. You're always going to find people who don't like you. In the past something like this would have been annoying and hurtful to me because I hate feeling misunderstood or dismissed, but the reality is that you're never going to be percieved perfectly by everyone. Best thing to do is take it as a grain of salt and be the best version of yourself that you can for YOU. I know not everyone likes me, but do I like me?? HELL YEAH I do!! 
13	I guess we'll have to agree with them, because we don't have our own opinions. 
18	Some things are pretty accurate, though they are just listing stereotypes. To say an ENFP is not a deep thinker shows they don't know us at all.
9	To be totally fair, if you read any of their other stuff, they just kind of hate everything and everyone.
7	¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
9	Yeah, I also think they're dealing with stereotypes or mistyped people. ENFPs I've met aren't overly emotional by any extent (just big weirdos) and the ENTPs aren't huge assholes (usually quite thoughtful). I do think ENFPs have problems with sticking to what's fun while avoiding pain and responsibility. 
7	Ugh. I am wary of the ENTP Reddit page. I was told that, as an INFJ, ENTPs were the best romantic match for us, followed by ENFPs. Well, I adore ENFPs to death, so I was curious about what ENTPs thought about us. So I went and searched, and while some posts talk positive, the rest . . . well, let's just say I've never felt more despised. Apparently we're narcissistic maniacs who think we're smart but only say dumb things everyone else already knows. And relationships are definitely not worth getting into. (To paraphrase one example - Question: "Why do I have so many problems with the INFJ I'm dating?" Answer: "You do know that Adolf Hitler was an INFJ, right?")\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike I said, they're not all like that, but the positives are few and far between.
4	Hahaha that first one hurt 2 sentences in, I couldn‚Äôt finish reading
5	Rly glad to hear dat, we won bois
3	They're just bitter and burned. Feeding into ridiculous stereotypes just because they had a couple of bad experiences and I question their contribution to those experiences.\nSaying that we don't have our own opinions (when we are a very opinionated type) and that we are void besides trying to mirror others is ridiculous. \n
4	Read all of them. I take generalized criticism with a grain of salt because realistically, their judgements are based on a small subset of ENFPs that they have met.
3	Lmao k then
3	For those who know games, we call this "Class envy."
3	Woop!	
2	Do ENFP's really need vodka to not be shy? People already think I'm drunk sometimes when I'm completely sober. üòÇ
1	Male INTP Getting mixed signals from female ENFP, thoughts?	Hey guys, I'm a male INTP (25) who is very confused about a female ENFP (21) that I recently met.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout a month ago I met this ENFP girl at a local college bar and we hit it off really well. We had similar interests. I found her very intelligent and the conversation was like lightning, something I am not used to AT ALL, as I am generally the one who has to carry the conversation. After what feels like an hour of chatting/flirting, she ends up asking me for my snapchat, and immediately initiates me after I leave the bar, heavy flirtation and conversation ensuing for quite a while before I go to bed. \n\nThe next day rolls around. She initiates me again on snapchat, but after a short time the conversation feels a bit one sided. I start getting one word responses and a general disinterest, so I try to take the hint and let the conversation cool off. I'm usually pretty self conscious about coming on too strong, so I decide that if she's interested she'll pick the conversation up on her own terms. \n\nA week goes by and by this point I've chalked it up to her not being interested, and figure that's the end of that. Friday night comes along and suddenly I'm bombarded with messages telling me that she's at the bar, asking where I'm at etc. I was surprised by this, and excited to see she was still interested but I genuinely couldn't be at the bar that evening, so I told her I wasn't going. The next night I made time to be there, and sent her a similar message asking if she would be there, but told me that she wasn't going out that night. Meh, bad timing.\n\nI was a bit disappointed at how things had gone that weekend, and being an INTP who hates not knowing where things stand, I directly asked her if she was interested, and willing to meet up during the week. I got wishy washy responses, which to me screamed "NOT INTERESTED". The conversation quickly died out, and later that day in frustration I decided to cut my losses and remove her from snapchat. Maybe a bit of a rash thing to do, but that kind of uncertainty scares the shit out of me!\n\nOnly minutes after deleting her I get a message asking why I deleted her from snapchat, to which I directly responded that I figured she wasn't interested. She floods me with messages telling me that she is interested but isn't sure if she is ready to meet up. I start to regret being hasty, chalking it up to overthinking. I tell her I understand, and that the ball is in her court if she wants to hang out. \n\nThree weeks go by without any conversation, and by now I have all but written her off as a potential romantic interest. Then saturday late night rolls in and I start getting the same messages as before, asking me where I'm at, that I should come to the bar and she wants to see me etc. I felt myself being sucked back in against my will, curiosity getting the better of me. Only this time I can tell she is completely hammered. She starts indulging to me her insecurities, worries etc. over text. I'm skeptical at this point that she is just extremely drunk and messaging me for attention, so I tell her we can talk later and end the conversation. \n\nThe next morning she messages me, and I playfully tease her about her messages the night before. Based on her demeanor, I think maybe she was embarrassed about her texts the night before. However, now she is engaging me in heavy conversation, and eventually asking me questions like "Hey have you ever been to place X by Y street? It has an awesome view at night. I haven't been there in quite a while". I take the bait and ask her if she wants to go together, to which she replies "Possssibly. Yeah." \n\nThe conversation continues a while longer and eventually she enthusiastically decides that we are going to meet up at place X. I respond with "Great, what days are you free this week?" She reads the message and never replies! That was two days ago. \n\nI want to be angry about this. I feel like in any other case it would be unforgivable, but instead I'm finding it almost endearing. Am I naive to think that there is no malice or manipulation in her actions? From what I have read, ENFPs are notorious for this kind of behaviour. But I genuinely can't tell if she is a) playing games, b) not interested, or c) extremely indecisive. I think a part of me is really attracted to her on/off behavior, but it also drives me insane! I'm an INTP! Not knowing where people stand makes my toddler developed feefees go crazy. \n\nSO my ENFP friends, can you shed some light as to what might be going on in the mind of this girl? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n&#x200B;
3	Given you just met this girl, how do you know she's an ENFP?\n\nI'm an ENFP and this is something I wouldn't do, I never try and play with a man's emotions, it just feels too cruel for me. \n\nIf I'm interested in a guy, I'll try to steer the conversation to connect with the person deeply  and would never blow them off.\n\nLooks like she might be an ENFP, but she also sounds Incredibly insecure and immature. Where as I've always been in long term relationships. 
2	I used to be like this in my early 20s. I had rather big self-esteem issues and really wanted to find someone but at the same time was scared shitless every time anyone showed serious interest. So I had this push/pull behavior and rejected the guys if they wanted to meet me then immediately regretted it and tried to reconnect... She may have similar problems. \n\nThe kind of advice I would give you is to just ask her to be her friend (if you're also ok with a friendship...). What she needs is someone who is genuinely interested in her personality, in her life and problems without the potential of getting into her pants. This is the part that made me wary the most I guess, knowing the guy wanted to date me even though he didn't even know the first thing about me. And simply telling a potential partner every thing about myself would have felt awkward and biased, I was rather looking for something without obligations and without the pressure of having to decide - so most of my encounters ended after the first or second date - sometimes by ghosting, sometimes full-blown outbursts. \n\nOf course this doesn't mean she necessarily has to deal with this stuff as well or react the same way,... I am pretty clearly an ENFP though (enneagram 4w3) and sometimes the similarities are astonishingly appropriate :)\n\n&#x200B;
1	She's 21...  You better know what YOU want because I doubt she knows at this age and being from (I'm assuming USA?) this country.\n\nLook if a young woman of any type is giving you the run around is it really worth your energy to worry about it?
1	Though you asked for ENFP advice here is my 2 cents if it helps ya, Dont waste your precious time & energy on such wishy-washy people . You will regret it later hanging on to it...What she is doing seems like playing games & its downright disrespectful. Cut her out of your life, there are plenty of fishes in the sea \~
1	She sounds young and distractible. It sounds like she‚Äôs not interested enough in you to be thinking about you when other things/people come up in her life. 
2	Depression! Just feeling weird about life...	Hello!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just need to share some thoughts to kind of process them and see if anyone else has ever felt this way...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been contemplating life & death, existence, meaning, divinity, etc. (as all ENFPs do, I'm sure). I used to believe in God, and I still believe there is something more than our physical reality, but knowing the reality of so many human experiences sometimes make me feel guilty when I try to live my own, if that makes sense...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can get so upset about things i can't control, but I know are true... like how many people suffer from severe mental illness and trauma (where is divinity and God's plan in this??)... I work at a social work job right now with adults with developmental disabilities and I love them all so much... I just sometimes get this dread, like how can there be so much pain? And it gets me stuck in a horrible pattern...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know there is also so much beauty and joy!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I also just feel so out of place in this world and especially western society. I have never valued material wealth, belongings, and as I get older, I don't think about my own appearance as having any significance... in fact, I kind of forget I exist and I am just lost in abstract thought! I have studied EXTENSIVELY hinduism, buddhism, Taoism, etc... but I don't know, I just don't know how people compartmentalize others' experiences...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am always thinking about the vast world/human and animal experiences and it hard to filter out the fact that so many suffer, and then also simultaneously recognize that I am alive and deserve to life my own life... if that makes sense...?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess I just default to overwhelming compassion at all times... and I don't see a world where that is the majority of others' experiences (or many at all)... musicians like Regina Spektor help me a lot. I guess I just feel out of place and guilty for things I shouldn't... does anyone have any advice?
12	Today is an amazing day	I've started to live knowing I am an ENFP. Even though I still do think I an one of a kind, I know there are ones similar to me. I am embracing our highs and the lows and to be honest, I'm currently very happy. I cannot remember the last time being this happy. I've been meditating for 7 days straight now. The weather is AMAZING, and life is good. I am very happy and I just wanted to share my happiness with you guys. You are amazing, and if you're in that ENFP low we all know so well, remember that it's only a small grain of sand of the great days we have. \nP.S I wanted to share my song of the day as well. It's called fishbowl by Tiny Moving Parts. \nP.P.S I love you all, I wish I could share my amazing positivity with each and every one of you beautiful creatures! Stay amazing!!!!!!
128	I can't get rid of this feeling within me that I need to do better, be better, act better, say more, do more, be more.	I can put words on a page, but I still feel alone. I don't know who else I can say this to that will relate.. I feel like I have no one I can speak to who will 1) care or 2) be able to help me. I haven't stayed in one place long enough to create a solid support network, I have friends I keep alienating and emotionally withdrawing from. I have parents who are both 6+ hours away from me. I have cousins who I rarely see. My siblings are all separated from me and are living with other people so don't need me. I'm the oldest so no one gets me, and I can't be everything to everyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just want a hug, I want love, I want something different to what I have now. Because right now, it feels like I have nothing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEveryone expects the world from me, but I don't know if I can give them anything close to what they expect. I want to step up to the plate, but I don't know if I can keep going like this. I don't know if I can keep losing friends and disappointing my parents, I don't know if I can keep not doing good enough or not being good enough for what I'm capable of.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes I wish I was average, because at least I could aim for what I want without disappointing people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't want to be the biggest or smartest or richest or most famous person in the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just want to be me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's so much for me to see in this world, and it feels like I'm selling myself out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to be free\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't want to be ordinary\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't want to be alone\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't want to spend my time staring at a phone\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want more than I have\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want my friends to like me for me, not because I help them get drugs\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't want to be a drug dealer\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't want to be a burden on the people around me\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't want to keep up a fantasy \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to live\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to grow\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to be better\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just don't want to disappoint the world while doing it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow can I hope to measure up when I can't even make the people around me happy?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow can I hope to measure up to expectations when I can't even make myself happy?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow am I meant to be satisfied with my lot in life?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I focus on myself, I'm a narcissist; if I focus on other people, I'm neglecting myself\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow can I win?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've given all I have to give, and I have nothing left.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like a shell of my former self.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy former self felt like a shell. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes I question if I'm anything more than a shell, or if I've ever been more than that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes I wonder if it would be better to run away from the world and go into the mountains alone - at least then I won't keep wasting my parent's money, time, thoughts and energy on me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wonder if my life would be any better in the real world, not this fake one we've made to keep ourselves going as a society.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSociety is a fraud.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr maybe it's just me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe I'm fake and the jig is up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe I'm not fake enough for this world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe I should stop hiding my emotions from the world, or maybe I should stop hiding period.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEverything I do is to not disappoint other people\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause without other people, would there be me?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow can I make a difference to someone else's life when I don't feel like I can do anything to help myself?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow can I see myself as useful when nothing seems to change after my intervention?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe world is doomed, or at least it seems that way to me\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm losing interest in everything, because everything is stupid and pointless\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm starting a new job soon, but can't escape the feeling that that's bad\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTrading my time on this earth for cash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTrading the only thing I will truly own in all senses, in exchange for an idea. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA shared delusion that makes the world run.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy time on this earth, in exchange for a never-ending stint on the hedonic treadmill\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy dad went through more than I did\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy mom went through more than I did\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEveryone else went through more, so don't expect sympathy for the journey that's ultimately yours\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI spent my whole life staring at screens, but so did everyone else\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like my life sucks, but so does everyone else\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like I'm not good enough, but so does everyone else\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to listen to my emotions, but so does everyone else\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy path to happiness is blocked by pain\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like a leech\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like no one really wants me around\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's easy to make people love you when you give them attention and make them feel important\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut sometimes it feels like that's all they'll ever love\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey'll never see the person behind that\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf he even exists\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe I'm just a lazy, unmotivated narcissist whose self-image is dependent on being seen as the most intelligent because that was the only way of getting his parent's approval as a child. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe I'm just a spoiled kid who felt abandoned but was really just ungrateful for his international school education.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe I've been exposed to too much of the world already - or maybe I haven't seen enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm tired of drugs, I'm tired of pointless entertainment. I'm tired of being the boring one. I'm tired of living off other people. I'm tired of not fitting in. I'm tired of not being able to find my place anywhere. I'm tired of being the odd one out. I'm tired of trying to fake my way to happiness. I'm tired of being told I'm wrong for not wanting to endure this suffering for the rest of my life. They ask me for experience that I don't have. I'm trying to get it but they won't let me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe worst thing?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I started telling this to people, I would be the problem. Maybe for a few days, a week or two at best, people would be sympathetic. But it wouldn't change anything. Pity means nothing when it's not truly needed or desired by either party. They would feel more of an obligation to pity me than to actually help. And once that obligation runs out, they'd stop pitying, and slowly start resenting. I'd be the one "bringing everyone's energy down", I'd be the one "ruining the vibe", I'd be the burden upon the rest of the world that no one really wants to deal with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut by not saying anything to anyone, I'm slowly killing myself from the inside.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can feel it every day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSoon there'll be nothing left..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't want to end up being that guy who hates himself and the situation he's in so much that he becomes resentful of the entire world and drags anyone else who's happy with him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's so much more to life than this. There must be. Otherwise what's the point?
20	In regards to the ending of your comment:\n\n *There's so much more to life than this. There must be. Otherwise what's the point?*\n\nI have some good news and bad news for you.  The bad news is, there isn't more to life.  This is it.\n\nThe good news is, that knowledge sets you free.  THIS IS IT.  THIS MOMENT NOW.\n\nUse it.
8	Please do me a favor and read "Henderson the Rain King," by Saul Bellow. Really rich trust fund kid, now in late middle age, has this gnawing voice inside, "I want, I want" that he has no idea how to quell. Has no material needs, and it all bores him. His life takes a turn when he goes on Safari with his buddy (technically he crashes his buddy's honeymoon) and inadvertently becomes a god to a bush tribe in the Savannah. Has an epiphany. He's an ENFP if ever there was one, and Bellow captures this unanswered "I want/I'm a worthless fraud" dichotomy succinctly and with beautiful prose. I knew you should read it just by the title of your post. Please PM me when you do, I'd love an excuse to re-read it along with someone and discuss. \n\nEdit: yes, this is the book that begat the Counting Crows song "Henderson the Rain King."
7	Wow, I relate to this a lot, maybe not directly but I relate to your constant feeling in me that I need to do better and be a better person. That in itself is a huge thing you need to hold on to. I used to deal coke through college, and use of course. It started with me just using it but then I would help my friends get it and it was a natural progression of thinking why not sell it.  I constantly felt guilty encouraging someone's nasty habit. I felt guilty that I was squandering opportunities afforded to me. And of course there are the mental and physical impacts of doing any kind of drugs. I was depressed, paranoid, guilty, angry...but all through it I knew it was something I had to stop. Both of us are able to acknowledge that something isn't for us. Thats a huge step. Thats admitting you have a problem in the first place. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI stopped selling and then stopped using almost a year ago today. I knew I had to stop and I felt so good once I did, life returned. Maybe I Digressed and got away from the point, but first, you must stop selling drugs and using any, even weed. That is the root of a lot of your problem. Life WILL return. Of course when you're a drug dealer, your relationships are going to be shallow! And knowing your personality you are quite extraverted and require a lot of genuine conversation. Being stuck in an identity that is based in deceit, illegality, criminality, is eroding you and robbing you of finding meaning. I would start there. Once you do that, then work on something else, chip away at things and don't overwhelm yourself and perfecting everything at once. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope this helps, feel free to message me. I'm sorry you feel overwhelmed and alone. It's horrible. I've been there and I thought I wouldn't make it out. I did to a certain extent, but it is a huge process to improve yourself from a low point. Its gradual and you must be patient. Don't forget to be thankful of what you do have. Think on your strengths and lift yourself up.
5	You asked a lot of questions here. I think you should take yourself somewhere peaceful, bring a meal and answer them the best you can. Its hard to be honest with yourself like that. No one needs to know but you though. \nYou sound like you're at a crossroad. Continue on the path you know or take a chance, struggle, and find something new. Who knows if it will be better but it probably won't be worse. \nThere is more to life but that means something different to all of us. We all have to figure out what that is on our own. 
3	You're not alone, man I feel like these could my words.
4	The fact that I didn‚Äôt have to read this because just by the title I knew what this is about. Is enough proof that I am an ENFP just like you. And also what scares me the most is the fact that this are not the priorities nor the questions everyone should be asking themselves. 
11	".... There's so much more to life than this. There must be. ..."\n\nI think most ENFPs feel like this...\n\nI've always been lost... and...\n\nI always asked myself that question too.... What's the point of all of this? \n\nFor me, that question was answered when \n\n I came to Christ... and my life is made new.... new passion, new people, new kind of love... A new way to live.
3	Man, I think this me all my life too 
2	Everyone deserves compassion. And you have my compassion. Y'all have my compassion. I know that the world is cruel and unfair, I know that the people often disappoint. And that sometimes we are the people who disappoint us. And I know that changing it feels impossible. And how hard it is to be there for a suffering person. And I know how disappointing and even infuriating those who are there for us when we're down, how it feels like they're not REALLY for us. I've experienced both sides of that coin. And that kinda helps to get the other side's perspective. \n\nAnd yeah, we can't change the entire world just like that. Sure. We can't entirely change ourselves as well. We are and will be imperfect. We will always struggle and suffer and make bad choices and doubt and, and, and. And that's okay. That's what makes us human. We are easily driven to evil, but doesn't it make good more beautiful and valuable? Don't we need the darkness to appreciate the light? Even in the darkness I seek the sparks of light. Maybe it's a mother hugging her little girl. Maybe it's a cute dog. Maybe it's a guy giving flowers to his girlfriend. Maybe it's the store clerk smiling to me. Maybe it's a charity worker doing his best to help someone. Maybe it's a bunch of kids, fooling around and having a good time together. All those give me that weird feeling that there's still good and kindness in this world and it moves me to tears. \n\nAnd work? I see it less as the treadmill, more as actual service. As helping people. Even a few people. And that what's the most important for me. The knowledge I've helped somebody, I've made somebody smile. \n\nI know it was super chaotic, naive and idealistic and stuff. I just woke up, I'm crying, I'm sorry
2	I closed up emotionally pretty much as soon as I read your first question because I knew the rest were going to hurt me. I feel... Pretty much all of this apart from the dealing drugs.\n\nEspecially the worry that I am only defined by other people and have nothing at all of myself.  And that it's easy to make people love you by making them feel adored but feeling like they don't care about you only how you make them feel.\n\nI don't really know the answer to these. I think I'm gonna use your questions for myself and see what I can answer because I've never written out how I feel the way you do.
2	Slow down, take a deep breath, and take everything one step at a time. \n\nYes, there is more to life. Become an entrepreneur and get paid for adding value into the world, instead of trading your time for money. You are already a drug dealer so you've experimented with entrepreneurship, albeit in an illegal way. Channel that entrepreneurial spirit into doing something positive for the world, instead of negative. \n\nGet around other entrepreneurs. Read books and learn the skillset. The journey will be long and hard, but at least you'll be doing it for you and no one else.\n\nAs for the money your parents are "wasting" on you, you need to reframe it as an INVESTMENT. You are on a journey. They gave birth to you and now are investing in you (whether they understand this or not.) There's no need to feel guilty about it because this is part of YOUR story and your journey. \n\nIf you feel like you're being a leech, then go get a job to fund your dreams, and then follow a path of freedom (entrepreneurship). You are feeling like this because you have no aim and no goal. Once you sit down and recognize what's out there, you will identify something that gives you a passion and a drive. Or, at the very least, makes you curious enough to keep moving forward in that direction. (i.e. a sense of purpose.)\n\nDrugs also mess with your brain chemistry and you need to quit those ASAP. Otherwise, no amount of logic or reason is going to help you. Find help if you cant do it on your own. Stop hanging out with other druggies. \n\nGood luck!

-4	So long and whiny. Up and set a goal to achieve and work at doing it. You may have less time to worry about all this shit. 
6	Am I at Fault	So I used to have a handful of friends I could y‚Äôall to a vent too and I would always help them out with whatever they were going through first. But eventually all of them left me, found new friends in uni or significant others. I just hate this feeling that I pushed them away with my problems. Most recently, I‚Äôve been talking to this girl online for about 9 months, she opened up to me about a lot of heavy stuff and I tried my best to be there for her in every way possible. Not going to lie I do have a bit of an attachment problem and I am a bit needy which was why I believe ruined my past friendships/relationships. Anyways, I only expressed needy-ness to her in the very beginning after she told me she loved me. This person lived on the other side of the country but after 9 months of talking she took a vacation around where I live (the place I live is very touristy) the first time we hung out was very easy, convo flowing like water no hiccups. She did show me a great deal of affection (holding my hand, running fingers through my hair) that I wasn‚Äôt expecting. The second time we met. Same thing holding hands, her showing a lot of affection. we saw a movie then I forgot where I parked so had a mini panic attack because she needed to get the airport soon. We said a rushed goodbye as I dropped her off to the airport. Texted her ‚ÄúI love you, text me when you land‚Äù she didn‚Äôt reply. Btw I regret not telling her I loved her in person but whatever. Again my anxiety kicked in, called her 3 times, texted her quite a lot, afraid something happened in the Uber. She texted me once letting me know she was on her connecting flight. That was the last I heard from her, she blocked me on FB and deleted her IG, doesn‚Äôt respond to text or calls and I was worried for a bit that she did something to herself but I saw from my friends FB that she posted on there recently. I just hope she‚Äôs ok, and if she never wants to talk to me. So be it, I‚Äôm still here for her and support her. Anyways, I keep getting the feeling that I talk more about my own problems than listen even though everyone of my friends say they feel comfortable sharing anything with me and they don‚Äôt hold back. But this series of lost contacts has me questioning my kindness and selflessness. Now I‚Äôm trying to focus more on how the other person is feeling and how I can help them, whether it be emotionally or physically. Well, just thought I‚Äôd share, hopefully some of y‚Äôall can relate. Hope you guys are having a beautiful day/night ‚ù§Ô∏è
3	Hey, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs your fault, you did your best helping them when you were there. Sometimes we ENFPs wondering what we did wrong, when actually people who were close to us they found better priorities and it hurts sometimes. I try not to think about it, because I don‚Äôt want to be negative about it. \n\nAbout the girl you met online, it sucks to hear that. But knowing that and you still want to be there for her, I think you‚Äôre doing the right thing. It‚Äôs nature to questioning our selfishness sometimes, because we care, right?  It‚Äôs a great thing to help the others feelings, and don‚Äôt forget to do self-care. Take care there!
1	Maybe you have helped them and they no longer need you. Or once they share something personal with you, you become ‚Äúthe person who knows‚Äù and that makes them uncomfortable. Being too clingy can also be a problem. Just remember to take hints where someone‚Äôs boundaries are and if you‚Äôre uncertain about that just ask them. Aside from that the situation you described sounds just like a shitty person. 
1	Yes it might be, unfortunately.  Calling her 3 times and texting her a lot scared her.  Don‚Äôt do that with your next. 
1	Hey! As a fellow ENFP I‚Äôm totally familiar with how you feel. It is in our nature to care. I think that is our forte compared to other personality types. I‚Äôm just gonna go against the flow here and say that there‚Äôs nothing wrong with what you did in this scenario. I had a similar experience with an INFP and I ended up ruminating on what went wrong and kept thinking that it is my fault. In hindsight tho, I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs over because the last thing I want to do is to care about a person who doesn‚Äôt even sure whether they want me or not. Like you, I ended up focusing my energy to people that I care about and would never ever second guess me. Much love, you got this üíñ

2	Don't wanna be a buzzkill but all these self-promoting videos irk me. 
17	Typical of Me	Just ENFP things: getting a call in the middle of the night and waking up to it (because of course my phone is on just for this very reason) so that you can give your friend an multi-hour therapy session for the craziness that is happening in her life and a little bit resenting her for it, but mostly just kind of loving that she thought of you to seek help from and that you get to help her. 
3	I'm familiar with this.\n\nThere's a saying what you tolerate in life persists.\n\nSecretly you like her pain.  When you stop tolerating other people's vicious cycles whole new things open up.\n\nOne of my friends who I have this cycle with I called today with the intention to stop tolerating her madness, we really broke new ground and got connected to what an over-achiever she is!
2	My brain somehow will snooze these calls.  Whoops.  Your friends will understand, I promise. 
1	That sounds awful 
3	Before-sleep fantasies?	Which are yours? \n\nFor me recently it has been about myself telling others how I landed the perfect job since I'm in job hunting season. \n\nSometimes it's me getting interviewed for being a  very successful podcaster/game maker/musician or book writer depends on what i have been working on that day.\n\nBut I would be lying if I denied the most frequent ones are about me being with the girl/s Im crushing on, it's always been like that. How we are having a cute talk remembering how it all has been going amazing or how there is drama and we solve it because we are just that good together. Sometimes even how I found someone that is just way better for me and how I break things up without hurting her, or she finds a way to make me fall in love with her. Actually usually the girl I'm crushing on just gives a face to this ideal girl, cause  I just don't really know her well yet, so I just take the pieces I do know and like about her and add them to the other traits I have found I love from past experiences.\nFantasizing and imagining this joyful scenarios kinda just gives me peace and helps me happily drift off to sleep. \n\nDo you guys do something similar?
2	Either about an imaginary story about a crush or I make up an epic adventure. Writing a storyline, picture actors I like in those roles and make scenes like a movie. Often related to LOTR, Harry Potter, Vikings,... With imaginary creatures.

15	I have a hard time being assertive and telling people what to do, out of fear that they will dislike me.	I‚Äôm a natural born leader who‚Äôs concerned with coming off as a dictator (even though I don‚Äôt act like one)
12	You're only a dictator if you make a request and think someone is obligated to do it.\n\nWhat you're describing is cowardice and the fear of not having control.\n\nThe true quality of a leader is their ability to empower others.\n\nLuckily it's something we can all develop and practice.\n\n.
1	There is a difference between demanding and asking. It will also help to explain why you want them to do something.
1	Really? I tend to piss people off for fun
1	I don't know your context so take this with a grain of salt but...\n\nI follow this designer from Facebook called [Julie Zhuo](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/average-manager-vs-great-manager-cf8a2e30907d) who made a really good point that I mostly agree with:\n\n* An average manager might assign tasks like: can you do X, Y and Z by the end of the week?\n* A great manager might assign tasks by saying: here's the situation. X, Y and Z are problems. What do you think we should work on?\n\nOf course those are just caricatures but you see the point. If you're not a hardass there's literally no need to be one!\n\nIf you're curious, there's actually quite a few types of leadership but one that's been popular with many companies nowadays is [servant leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership). It's the idea that leaders support their team more than tell them what to do, because their team might genuinely know more than they do.\n\nInstead of telling your team what to do, you support their growth. You mentor them. You help them become better people.\n\nAnd if you're worried about being assertive, consider this. There will be times you'll need to put your foot down, sure. But you'll know when. If someone's being aggressive and harming others emotionally or physically, if you're anything like me you'll empathise so greatly with the person being harmed that you can't help but put your foot down and try to stop these things from happening.\n\nHopefully that was useful.
1	I dont have that issue. If people dont like me I could care less!

1	We ENFP's can be way too hard on ourselves.\n\nAllow yourself some grace to know how awesome you are.  Most people know already.  Why obsess over your faults when there are so many people out who love your way of being?
1	Yup yup yup yup yup yup
1	Ah atla,  but seriously, relateable as hell
12	Treat yoself	All us ENFP's outta start treating ourselves like the Kings and Queens we are.\n\nWhen people show up we can think we gotta show up on their level.  If they're being negative or being 'average' like I know we tolerate and we just want shit to be awesome.\n\nStart raising the bar, we don't need anyone to bring us down.  Raise all these fools up.\n\nKnow what I'm saying?\n\nYou see someone raising that bar high?  I say RAISE IT HIGHER!

2	I can‚Äôt talk to girls at all... help	I have an extremely strong bond with my close friends and I feel like I can instantly relate to anyone when talking to them. Sometimes I can‚Äôt start conversations because I overthink but when I do start I feel like others can‚Äôt continue a conversation as I would like it to go so it just ends. My main problem is I don‚Äôt know how to talk to girls at all, being on Reddit instead of actually trying to talk to them might not be a good way of fixing this. I feel like they will think I‚Äôm hitting on them even though all I want is a good deep conversation and another person I can call a friend. 
5	Sounds like you have the point of view girls are different from boys.\n\nWhat may help is realizing they are people, just like boys are.  There's no reason to feel intimidated.\n\nIn fact in general people can feel intimidated approaching people they don't know.  So learn how to break the ice and do them a favor!\n\nYou sound young.  Don't worry you got this.
2	Learn to talk to everyone. Honestly old people young people, men, women. People you find attractive and people you don‚Äôt. Build the social skills and suddenly everyone will think you are flirting with them.\n\nIn high school I had no social skills at all but now when I try to tell people that I‚Äôm awkward they barely believe me. 
1	Girls really seem to like it if you treat them as what they are- a person just like you who happened to end up in a different body. Too many people treat them like some kind of mystical being too different from themselves to talk to normally. Attractive girls can be intimidating, but just remember that they want a comfortable, normal conversation just as much as you do. 
3	UNI COURSES FOR ENFP	ENFP here looking for a suitable course for uni but at lost on what to focus on\n\nDEGREES not in any particular order\n1. Media and comms\n2. Physiotherapy/ occupational therapy etc\n3. Psychology\n4. Art business management\n5.  Architecture \n6. History \n7. Statistics \n\n\nOne of the more prominent courses that catch my eye would be the Architecture course, but i am wondering as a true ENFP, would i able to handle the technical aspects of the degree etc? \nPlease help a fellow ENFP out :)
3	You're actually going to be surprised. Being an ENFP won't slow you down at all with learning technical subjects. Like seriously. You'll think--oh god Architecture is the hardest thing in the world. But if you're reading about architecture in your spare time and learning the concepts and trying to build CAD and wood models and immerse yourself into that world, you're going to get it.\n\nI personally learnt basic computer science as my first technical subject, and had to learn some neuroscience during uni and god it was hard. But if you learn one subject, then the second, third and fourth courses are so much easier. The learning curve is steep then flattens.\n\nI think too, if you're really curious about all those subjects, one option you have is to actually try them all. Sit in all of those classes and just learn for the sake of learning. To be honest, the thing I remember from those subjects isn't the material, but the lecturers. Great lecturers make or break the course. Listen to other people's reviews of courses especially from people older than you.\n\nLast thing is again, don't worry about making a big misstep. I guess I'm lucky in Australia bc uni fees are really low but I've had lots of friends switch degrees two or three years in. You're going to grow. You're going to have different interests. You'll want a different degree two years from now more than likely. So don't stress about making the perfect decision now.\n\nOtherwise I don't have anything specific to say about each subject. Good luck!
2	I'm a philosophy, politics and economics major and love it. Studying the 3 fields makes the world make more sense and allows me to spend all day making connections between things. I was an engineering major for a bit, and the biggest issue was not technical learning but the challenge of working with all introverts and technically minded people. I found I need interesting discussion and people I can connect with in order to succeed. Most people in science or engineering fields tend to be extremely difficult to be around for long periods of time just due to the fact that they almost never talk, and when they do its brief and seems like an attempt to end the conversation.  But then again, maybe they just didn't like me much.\n
1	I studied drama.  (theater)
1	I do polymer chemistry, so really just pick something you like.
1	Film and Media Studies Major here‚Äî definitely recommend production or screenwriting kinds of courses if your university offers them even at an introductory level. Television studies is also a really fun field within media studies.
1	Hello! I am an ENFP who finished a degree in speech therapy. Although I deal with a different domain of human functioning, there are overlaps with the case load and general therapeutic skills required from physiotherapists (PT) and occupational therapists (OT).\n\nThings that I like in relation to being ENFP:\n1. Being part of a support system and an advocate for better quality of life in persons with disabilities or medical conditions. This is aligned with my personal advocacies which is a strong motivating factor. It is also reinforcing that I work for meaningful change in people's lives and patients express gratitude (but not always and I need to manage my frustrations with slow progress and unproductive therapy sessions).\n2. Creativity is required in coming up with activities for different ages and backgrounds. Always a challenge to make therapy fun and effective for both you and client. For speech therapy, it is not just sitting their and talking but designing something fun and meaningful to talk about. My OT and PT friends also agree with this.\n3. Therapy is not a recipe-book approach. Constant analysis and intake of data to spot patterns in the client's behavior is needed for effective assessment and therapy planning. It always feels like I am solving a new puzzle and is quite exciting when connections click.\n\nSome tasks I have issues with due to being an ENFP:\n1. Working full time in a clinic can land you as much as 30 to 40 patients a week (in my experience) each with different personalities and needs. It is physically and emotionally draining. You need time alone after. Also I get very easily affected by my client's emotions which sometimes includes frustration over their lack of progress.\n2. It can feel somewhat routinary because turnover of clients is not that fast. Depends on the diagnosis and age group too. I've seen people work years with the same person on the same goals. It can feel predictable or make you say "ugh this again" if you don't actively work on assessing each new behavior objectively.\n3. Documentation. You're going to need tons of follow up and attention to detail on how you objectively track progress at different intervals of time. It also varies from different practice settings and countries.\n\nThat's as far as I can comment on my knowledge as a speech therapist. I can ask my OT and PT friends if you need more discipline-specific information. (Sorry for formatting; on mobile) Good luck! :)
18	Something I Wrote When I Was 17‚Äìnothing special, but have a feeling you guys might relate	‚ÄúWild and free and different. Traveling the world. Happy  adventure. Creative and new and beautiful. Making art, playing music, writing. Being soft. \n\nNo structured job or routine or supervisor. Living and working on my own. Freelance fun and love. \n\nYellow and pink and green and sky blue. Bright and happy. Trees and flowers and sunsets and freedom. \n\nLaughing and smiling and loving and living. \n\nHoping and happy, feeling every moment. Travel and art and music and me. \n\nA little house with a big yard and dogs and cats and more. A little garden and big windows. Soaking up the sun. \n\nDriving everywhere, going no where. Plane ride to another world, but always coming back home. \n\nFree and happy. \n\nVision.‚Äù\n\n\n\n
2	This was a beautiful read, really. I was vividly imagining everything as my eyes went over each line. 
1	ENFP Male Interviewing ISFP Male Julien McLaren Fi-Ni SC/B(P)	
1	Found a totally ENFP notepad by accident: Ride a cock horse to Banhwry Grose to see a fine lady upon a white horse, rings on her fingers and bells on her toes.	
3	How to set goals as an ENFP who dislikes goals?	Hey guys! I am an ENTJ manager (borderline with ENTP) and longtime ENFP fan (two good friends are ENFPs). I‚Äôm writing on behalf of one of my ENFP employees, who recently experienced a death in the family of someone very important to him. He continues to express that he wants to set new goals for himself coming out of this jolting experience, and to better carry on the legacy of the deceased. \n\nI‚Äôve tried goal-setting exercises and he feels they are ‚Äòcorny‚Äô ‚Äî I‚Äôm guessing this is my J being a little bit too J for him! I bought him a journal because he says he likes to write his thoughts out to better understand  what‚Äôs important to him right now. \n\nWas the journal a good idea? What other things can I try to help him figure out what‚Äôs worth it to him to be striving for? He has so much energy and passion and I‚Äôm dedicated to helping him channel it in the ways that will mean the most to him. 
5	Your ENFP friend is saying it's corny because he doesn't believe writing down his goals makes them come true.\n\nThis is common among ENFP's who haven't yet discovered their access to power is discovery and exploration.\n\nI would get him connected to what's really important to him, what he really wants in life (a wife?  kids?  lots of money) - and most importantly remind him when setting goals he has the freedom to always change his mind.\n\nDon't let him settle for anything less than his biggest dreams.  That is guaranteed to resonate with him.
12	Never ending cycle of being extrovert and introvert	So this happens to me in waves, like I would personally say that I have a lot of friends. And I would always reach out to them first because I want to show them how much I love them an how important they are to me. But soon I would discover that not all of them want me or I'm not that interesting and I would exhaust myself by trying to reach out or to talk to them.\n\nI would fall into a micro-depression and stop caring for anyone. Why would I, if they don't care for me. Of course some will reach out for me, but I would feel very abandoned. I would become an introvert trying not to reach out for anyone. But for me, not talking or hanging out with no one is really torturing me. So I decide to reach out for friends, and the cycle repeats itself.
3	I used to feel like that often as well. I talked about it with some of my closest friends and they told me they still care just as much about me, but people just have LIVES and aren't solely occupied by you. It made me realise I'd often be self-centered and think I'm "important" in a way because I express so much love for others so I expected them to show the same thing towards me. But people are different, people show they care in many different ways, big or small. Even if friends make new friends, it doesn't mean you mean any less to them. Something that helped me personally is being more aware of when I purposely don't talk to certain friends, not reply to them or not always express how much I care about them. I have such moments too because I'm either busy with life, focused on something, working on my self, if I need alone time, etc... I saw myself as "the perfect friend" and felt almost offended if my friends didn't show it just the way I did. Especially towards my introverted friends I'd often lash out because they don't express it the way I wanted them too. It's plain selfish and dumb though. I have about 3 friends of who I am certain they care about me and love me and that thought is enough for me. I respect them and pay more attention to the smaller things they do to show they care about me. It's something that's just in your head basically. You gotta change your mindset.
3	Sounds like the ENFP cycle of people pleasing.\n\nThe cycle works as long as you are growing.  If you are not feeling like you are growing I would look at who you are interacting with.\n\nMy purest growth as an ENFP has come by servicing others who come to me.  Now, I've had growth by chasing others too, that was painful and I'm learning how to make it also postively nurturing.\n\nYet really I think when we don't take people for granted and continue exploring deep relationships we're in a healthy cycle.
1	What's the best resource to find out more painfully accurate facts about us ENFPs?	What's the best Test to take, where is the best place to look for the definitive 'ENFPs 101' facts? If you know what I mean.
5	Don't take tests, they are unreliable.

10	Not anymore.  I used to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen I realized that was just the fear talking.
7	Absolutely! This is me.
7	DaveSuperPowers talks about this a lot. We‚Äôre considered ‚Äúdouble deciders‚Äù because we have Fi and Te (the decision makers) in the middle and our observers in the front and back (Ne/Si) We gather allllll the info w the Ne, then have a tough time making decisions because of FOMO mostly. ‚ÄúWhat if I buy the gray Prius and tomorrow a white  Civic pops up on the lot?‚Äù I lean on my Te a lot more than I do my Fi, so while I do get stuck on big decisions, my Te really helps me narrow down my options, and usually chooses what works best rather than just what‚Äôs prettiest or what color I like best. When I still can‚Äôt decide on something, I do a few things... do some research and make some ‚Äúpros and cons‚Äù notes. I find myself learning more from bouncing ideas off other people so I‚Äôll ask advice from 1-3 trusted friends or fam. Lastly, I‚Äôll just crawl under the blanket and refuse to accept responsibility for my adult choices. 
6	At times it feels as though I "fell into" my career as an IT professional, but I made it my own and have done reasonably well in it.\n\nI feel that while I might not have made the original decision to become a tech pro, but I found those parts of it I liked, and made it my own. So, in that way my choice wasn't the one about how to earn my living, but it was how to find my niche in the way I learn my living. 
4	Wow I've never related to anything more. There are periods of time where I use my magic 8 ball to make all of my decisions. \nI'm working hard to lose the weight to join the military because itll change everything for the better. 
5	Develop your T. In the beginnig you will have to force yourself to do it and that's the worst Part of it. But when you have collected some experience with it, you will actually start getting Things done plus not caring as much what other people might think. Rock it :)\n\nIf I could do it, every ENFP can. üòÇüòâ\n\nEdit: and what I mean by that is: sit your ass down once a day write the stuff down that you want to achieve, write down the steps you have to do to get there and be very firm with yourself. Structure your Life and your goals!
4	You need to develop your Fi and Te to know what you want and be assertive and decisive. Never say "whatever" or "I don't know" or "you decide" or "I don't care" when presented with something. Even if one choice is only a millimeter more than the other in your mind choose it. This will help you get more in touch with what you want and make decisions. Doing this a lot will help you see what you want in other aspects of life too.
3	Yesss. I'm 41, and I started a job as a researcher at a renowned consultancy company 3 months ago. Coming from a research job where my manager was an INTJ, I had to take a firm decision and get away from him because he was so secretive about my future in his team, all the while complimenting me for my work A LOT and saying he wanted me in his team, basically confusing me. Well my contract ended, I signed the new one, and he said this was no real research, I would do second class work there, and he hopes we would continue to work again together one day. He started emailing me asking if I missed the team and that I should think of him and so on, now I know he's starting as a professor at another university. \n\nHe's dominating my brain even though I haven't seen him for three months. I made a decision and now I feel sick and sad and I just want him out of my life but miss him as my boss because he was just the best - on a content and work related basis. He didn't take responsibility for the emotional well being of his employees, though, and I remember I once gave him a bitch-slap for this because it really pissed me off. He didn't take care of me, either. He didn't care to sit down and talk to me, even though I tried to do that. \n\nI find it hard to stick to my decision. My new company counts on me, I receive validation, but I see what my old manager meant when he said "second class" . However, I didn't receive any offer from him, only somehow emotionally fuelled strange hints. Feels creepy and I don't know what to think of this.\n\nSo. I took a decision. I left (as he put it: to me, my contract ended). I should move on. I struggle so much. \n\n
2	Whole life 
2	Like someone else said. I feel like I just fall into things. Good things and bad things. Have learnt to make decisions more actively with my Te and talk myself out of avoiding consequences/failure as I got older. 
1	What sort of questions and choices are you having trouble making? What is it about those choices that you find daunting? 
1	yes, yes 
1	Apparently we're all having this issue. Yay us!
1	Yes.
1	It's ruining me 
1	My intj partner calls me the Question Machine :(
1	I'm okay with independence because I have to be, but decision making is one of the hardest things for me. Add in cripplingly low confidence and fear if making the wrong choice and you have a recipe for disaster. I'm always worrying about a choice I need to make, or regretting a choice I have made in an infinite cycle.
1	Story of my life! 
1	I‚Äôm not really one to talk, since I am a history major with no concrete plans for the future and a lot of panic - but one thing that helps me out immensely with figuring out life stuff and gaining motivation is to make bullet point lists!\n\nFor example - by age 23, I want to be either in a good grad school or have a full time job, I want to be able to run 10k, I want to know how to skateboard, I want to have completed my reading list of actual intelligent literature, and I want to feel that my writing is in a better place. Hopefully I‚Äôll actually have a decent boyfriend. \n\nWhile that‚Äôs great for short term goals, going far into the future helps a LOT too with filling in the gaps and having a bit more direction! Even if they‚Äôre just guide lines, and you never know what might happen, it‚Äôs still useful to have something to aim for.\n\nFor example: \nBy the time I‚Äôm 35, I want to: Be married with 2 children, own a house, have enough earnings to live comfortably (aka not too much stress), write and speak sophisticatedly, have stayed slim and fit, etc...\n\nAnyway yeah, I struggle with life decisions myself, and I know it can be hard to sit down and spend a while listing everything out, but it really has helped me quite a lot! In the year since I‚Äôve started, my life has changed quite a lot for the better - it‚Äôs like writing this stuff kinda wills it into the universe to happen, haha üòÇ \n\nAnyway idk if anyone read all this but good luck!
1	Yep. I studied computer science and currently work as a developer and am going insane. I \*think\* I want to be a teacher? Not sure. Big decision to make - 2 more years of school is required...
1	I'm kind of all over the place right now 
1	oh boy, lemme tell you the story of my life. (jk)\n\nbut yeah. its hard, I love when shit happens that makes decisions for me. I'm good at making the most out of a bad situation, hell that might be one of my strengths. I'm terrible at deciding when I'm handed a situation and told to just pick one. Job? Car? Apartment? doesn't matter. Choosing one is hard. \n\nDirection in life, even worse. How do people even understand their calling? I've worked on trying to hone this ability, i've gotten closer. And then to actually make the decision to pursue something that I have no idea is actually going to be as fulfilling as I hope it is? Even harder. \n\nIts a challenge. but this is what i've got so far. Its better to dictate the terms of your own existence than to be dictated to. Accept the responsibility that comes with life. When you make a decision, do everything you can to focus on the reality of the decision and not the possibilities of the paths not taken. There will be time for reflection to help you make better decisions in the future, but that reflection isn't a series of "if.... then..." statements about what could have been. \n\nThe ultimate success of decisions is in the implementation of them, all the smaller decisions that people make every day (sometimes without knowing it), the big decisions in life just set you on different paths. We get hung up on those big decisions, and getting so hung up on those that we forget about everything in between is the real danger. Its hard, but make a decision and move forward. \n\nHow to move forward? With confidence, another thing that is really hard to come by on accident. Confidence comes, to me, from experience. I'm confident in myself if I've done something before and have a good idea that its the right course of action. I can't have confidence if I'm so absorbed in all the ways my decision is right and wrong, and all the ways things could be better if I had chosen differently. But confidence is still important, so where does that come from? Well, I know myself. I know that I don't make decisions without thinking things through. I also know that even if things aren't perfect, I'm still going to make the most of it. So where is the anxiety coming from? From the new and unknown, an unknown that is unavoidable and is a constant between all decisions. Once I realized this, its made making and living with decisions (without regret) a lot easier. Then over time that confidence will build that is more of a confidence that I've seen situations like this before and know what to do. \n\nEssentially, bet on yourself and you'll make it out on the other side. the more you do it, the easier it is but you still have to do it without knowing whether its the right decision. 
1	I'm making another comment on this.\n\nYou feel this way because you think you don't deserve what you want RIGHT NOW.\n\nYou absolutely do deserve and and can have those things.  You just need to move towards them and if you fail, move towards them again and never stop.
1	We are amazing when it comes to confidence. One.of the traits we have is to become like someone. We should just fake confidence till we make it. Also being vulnerable sometimes doesn't make you a weak person. Confidence has to like a jacket "wear it whenever we need". Pretend even if you dint have it. After a month or two you would feel you are not just confident but overconfident and proud.\n\nVulnerability grows you. But too much inferiority will reduce your testosterone (if you are a guy).\n\nDont be too nice to people or express your vulnerabilities/feelings/emotions.\n\nThis is a fucking bad world. The rest of the other personality types will kill us for being nice to them. Fuck**n bastards. Be careful with S T J types. Adapt their traits if needed. Lets fuck the world.
3	The Puer/puella syndrome and ENFP	Hi fellow inspirers!  Through my interest in MBTI I have dug in deeper into the Jungian source and am in the process of learning about archetypes. I've recently come across one called the Puer, or "eternal boy" (with the feminine counterpart Puella, or "eternal girl") that I believe holds a lot of resonance for our type. As so often in Jungian thought, the attraction of this archetype (captivating charm, freedom from responsibility, sense of being special) is also part of its downfall (lack of identity, inability to commit, lack of concrete role). This passage especially struck me:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Puers and puellas live a provisional life. There is always the fear of being caught in a situation from which it might not be possible to escape. Their lot is seldom what they really want; they are always ‚Äòabout to‚Äô do something, to make a change; one day they will do what is necessary‚Äîbut not just yet. They are awash in a world of ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù: ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôll do this ‚Ä¶ maybe I‚Äôll do that ‚Ä¶‚Äù Plans for the future come to nothing; life slips away in fantasies of what will be, what could be, while no decisive action is taken to change the here and now.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally in Jungian thought, the key to personal growth is integrating the opposite rather than pushing it into shadow. In this case, the opposite of the Puer is the Senex, or old man. Of course, since the article is written by a Jungian analyst her suggested pathway to integrating the Senex is...Jungian analysis (something I'm thinking about but have not yet taken the plunge.) She also suggests that a psychological crisis could precipitate the integration of the Senex also. I'm curious to hear whether other ENFPs find the archetype of the Puer/Puella resonant and whether you've managed to integrate the Senex into your psychology, whether mindfully or through trauma/circumstances.\n\n&#x200B;
4	I suppose my 'Senex' is motherhood. Becoming a parent anchors you and brings responsibilty. I have my rebellious moments, but providing my children with routine and stabilty is important to me now.
2	You gave us the low down on Puer/puella, but you didn't describe how to integrate the Old Man :D\n\nNow I have to google it!!!
2	What is your opinion on Socionics?  They would call the Puer / Puella (Beebe's term) as the Mobilizing / Activating Function and this function also has a Hidden Agenda.\n\nBut the Hidden Agenda is different depending which of the 8 Information Elements (what Jung calls the 8 Cognitive Functions) in the HA slot.\n\nI have more thoughts but I rather ask questions and then do follow up on those questions =)
2	What is the most effective way to overcome this state? I'm stricken by how much this resonates with me.
2	Have any of you switched careers to teaching?	ENFP going through massive career struggle right now. I studied computer science (and I like it) but full time development work feels like it's killing who I am. It's brought on really bad anxiety. I'm trying to think of other paths I can take and teaching is one of them. I could teach computer science but I'm concerned about the work culture and the repetition (endless marking...).\n\nHave any of you switched careers to teaching? Do you feel like it was the right choice? What made you switch?
1	Started as sysadmin/developer, switched to teaching, switched back to software development.\nTeaching is great, but I had to give up because of a very low pay that didn‚Äôt let me to pay the bills.
2	Working out/ Healthy lifestyle	I struggle with working out / eating healthy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think having someone to hole me accountable would help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know this isn't a fitness sub, that's the point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have any real life pointers to help me get back to a healthy lifestyle??
2	I'm not going into the details of health, but try to stay on the topic of motivation. So let me start by saying that I always find it difficult to motivate myself to work out and eating healthy is harder than it looks. That's why I usually spend 3-4 months a year living healthy untill I fall back into my old habits. My bodyfat % has gone from 25 to 15 to 18 to 12 to 9 to 15 to 12 to 16 to 10 and now I'm around 14 and descending.  \n\nFirst things first: you cant outrun your diet. I use MyFitnessPal to track calories. This helps you to guide your diet.   \n\nI try to minimize my environmental footprint. Not eating palm oil and chocolate produced by slaves helps me to reduce my snacking.  \n\nDentist told me that you can have a max of 6-7 eat moments per day or your teeth will decay faster. So that's an extra motivator to eat less times and stop drinking soda.  \n\nIt's hard to get Into a gym rhythm. What helps for me is to go at least 3 times in one weak. Once I've done that, I'm more inclined to get into a rhythm and start feeling bad if I don't go.  \n\nGet a gym buddy if that helps!  \n\nSet clear goals for yourself, long term and short! For instance: I want to be around 8% bodyfat by April the 29th So I have set a goal to be around 11% on March the 15th.  \n\nCommunicate: tell everyone you're going to eat healthy and work out, so they can motivate and correct you if you're slacking.  \n\nGet some good pumping music. \n\nAnd; to go a bit off topic. Check what you eat in terms of sugar, fat and calories. Many brands advertise as "healthy" while their muesli is filled with sugar. Also: it takes me about a few days to a week to get used to food I don't like. 
2	I work out at a gym with my brother. We started 2 years ago and won a strength challenge 2 months after starting, beating 16 teams. It was based on strength increase.\n\nI don't like going to the gym alone. It is harder to get motivated and is boring. So if you can find someone to workout with that will help.
49	How do you remain in control of your emotions in romantic relationships?	This seems to be something that a lot of ENFPs struggle with... we have a tendency to smother the person with love and affection. When a fight ensues, we tend to need immediate answers when other personality types need more time to think things through. We can easily turn into stage 5 clingers when we like a person. I don't know how it is for you guys, but that's how it is for me anyways. I'm making it my goal to remain more in control of my emotions though, and to do all of these things a bit less. \n\nHow do you remain in control of your emotions within a romantic relationship?
23	a mindfulness practice and a partner with healthy boundaries and the ability to be firm (but not an asshole) helped me immensely. i struggled with being clingy and insecure into my early 30s, when i met my husband. he was very adamant about having his alone time, even in the early stages of our relationship when i wanted to be all up on his nuts 24/7.  most partners i‚Äôve had were happy to accept my influence and dive into la la land with me at the beginning of the relationship, which typically ended up being detrimental when we both found we needed more space. while i initially bristled against my husband‚Äôs independence, i eventually found that it was way healthier for both of us, and set a good foundation for the relationship. \n\ni‚Äôve also been doing yoga for about 15 years now and the practice of observing my reactions and learning to pause when i start to freak out has been completely life changing. i‚Äôve learned that while i can‚Äôt always change my immediate, gut feeling about something, i can change how i react to it. \n\nnone of this is to say that i‚Äôm perfect (and neither is my husband) but we‚Äôve managed 6 years with only a few big fights - 3 of those with a baby in tow!
12	I suggest not feeling you have to control anything, just be authentic.  The fallacy of this line of thinking for ENFP's is thinking you 'have to be a certain way.'\n\nHowever you're constantly weighing your actions with values, that's your virtue, use it.\n\nI think an ENFP who is in doubt and opens up authentically is moving in the right direction, here's a great video about our thought proccess/wiring:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSpToRo7Frc&t=142s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSpToRo7Frc&t=142s)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe more we explore our authenticity in relationships, work, etc, the more we get what we really want and the more unstoppable we become.  You don't have to make yourself smaller to be happy.
9	I had an issue with this. But I learnt that its more rewarding when you receive attention, love and affection purely because the person wants to, not because you forced it out of them.\n\nIt may start out as less often, but once the person trusts you, you will recieve it regularly.\n\nI gave myself rules as well. Because I have no discipline with my emotions.\nThings like, "if you just hung out, wait a day before speaking to them".\nOr if you initiated the last date, wait for them to intiate the next one.\n\nMind you... All these things are just when the relationship is starting out. Once you're together and in love, I don't generally hold back.\n\nI just act my natural loving self who has a lot of love to give and if the person can't handle that they're not the one for me.\n\nI don't mind holding back when getting to know someone, but I can't hold back indefinitely.\n\nGotta meet someone in your level. I wouldn't reccommend anyone of the STJ types for an ENFP. \nI recommend dating an INFP.
5	My husband‚Äôs an ENFP. While I have teased him for being ‚Äúclingy‚Äù in the past, I actually really admire/envy his capacity for emotional expression and closeness. I‚Äôm an INFJ and I tend to need space when I‚Äôm going through stuff. My ENFP is always understanding of this need for space (although sometimes I need to remind him a couple times).\n\nI think the most important thing is that you continue to be yourself and love the way you feel inclined to, while also respecting your partner‚Äôs need for space. I think if you over think your emotions, you will drive yourself to an unnecessary state of insecurity. My husband never apologizes for his desire to smother me with love and affection, and that makes it all the more attractive. The consistency of a partner who always has love to give is AWESOME. Just tune into your partner‚Äôs boundaries and try to remain aware of your own needs as they change over time.
6	also, when I feel secure in myself and my relationship, I'm less likely to be extreme with my emotions. It's when I'm feeling insecure that I go a little crazy. So I try to focus on improving the security aspect. 
3	You don't. It always controls me. But I can kinda moderate it and stay down to earth, realistic. I don't indulge in them. I just always stay very honest and tell them exactly what I think and let them decide what to do with it. I'd never force my emotions or feelings on someone and back off if needed.
2	I find it helpful to find other outlets for my emotions - exercise, friends, writing, etc. 
1	Ok, I agree some level of filter sometimes must be applied but I don't like it. It ends with someone getting hurt at some point. 
1	One thing I do that seems to help is:\n\nIf something bothers me or makes me upset I try to process it over the next couple days. \n\nIf I‚Äôm still upset than it‚Äôs probably something that needs to be discussed and is easier to talk about because I‚Äôm in a more rational place of understanding myself and not just emotionally reacting. \n\nIf I‚Äôm not upset still than it‚Äôs probably nothing. \n\nI, to the best of my ability, try not to engage unhealthy emotional responses in the moment and let those snowball into irrational negative interactions with my partner. \n\nFor me it‚Äôs about respect for myself and being emotionally responsible with my partner and also respecting them so much that I don‚Äôt put them in the position to handle such irresponsibility from me. \n\nHope this helps. 
1	Well, ENFPs need to control themselves, it IS as simple as that. Yes it hurts a lot when our partner is unable to answer directly but that is who He / she is. And If you have to force him ask yourself If you really love him / her Like He is or If you want him / her to be different.\n\nBecause for him or her it might be painful to come Up with an answer right then and there. Ofc it really also depends on the way they ask for time. An SO who says: I See your pain but I need some time to give you a good answer does hurt a lot less than someone who simply gives you the silent treatment.\n\nAnd yes that means you have to learn to endure pain, but that is something that is healthy for ENFPs to learn anyway.\n\nOn the other hand, If He or she constantly gives you the silent treatment without acknowledging how Bad it must feel for you then I would seriously consider that the relationship is going nowhere and you might want to end it.\n\nSorry for being so blunt.
1	I use a bunch of tools regularly to help me regulate my emotions include meditation (I find body awareness meditation very useful), EFT tapping, and journalling (written and audio). If you have any attachment trauma, consider seeing a therapist who is knowledgeable in the area to help you work through it, as that can make it much more difficult.\n\nI find it also helps a lot to stay in touch with friends and and not just vanishing into a romantic relationship. For example, let's say you have a lunch date with a friend scheduled on a weekly basis - keep that going and don't just stop that because you fell in love. If you normally call your bestie twice a week, keep those calls going, or just reduce them to once a week. \n\nSO many people just stop doing all those things when they find a new partner, and it's super unhealthy for you and for your friends, who will probably feel neglected. It's problematic for you to isolate yourself in a new relationship, as you're likely to ignore red flags and lose perspective. Keep up your usual hobbies and activities too, rather than just spending every spare moment with a new partner. 
1	So I used to jump headfirst into relationships, thinking, "screw boundaries and societal rules for relationships! I know what's best for me! I don't need rules or boundaries!"....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever it always lead me to being burned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've learned that not all boundaries are bad. If I impose boundaries on myself and slow down in the beginning of a relationship, things work out better.
1	A lot of friends with whom I can share my feelings and who support and entertain me and a lot of detachment + poker face ;) faint the indifference, it works !
1	Calling All ENFPs! How do you like your job?	Hello fellow ENFPs!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wanted to make a post because I'm honestly curious if ENFPs like their jobs. I currently have a job that crushes my soul, and I wanted to see if I'm a rare case or if this is more common among ENFPs. I've heard of ENFPs who love their jobs, but I don't hear much about the ones that don't. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease tell me whether or not you like your job! I would also like to hear what your job is, if you don't mind sharing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFYI, I work in IT. My official title is "IT Support Technician." I troubleshoot issues with customers via email and phone. It's boring and never ends.
6	After some time starting new jobs, quitting old ones, and repeating over and over, I realised that it's not the job that is the problem. I am the problem.\n\nSure, there are certain jobs I am not meant for, but as long as I have contact with humans in my work and there is some time to be goofy, I can make it work. However, it takes a bit of patience and mindfulness to realise that everything I want is already in my possession. If my home town seems dull and boring, it's because I am not looking closely enough into new avenues for fun. If my friends seem repetetive and mind-dulling, it's because I'm not truly listening. Some things are immediately fun, and you don't need to look for it at all. But the really beautiful things in life require a sturdy shovel. Start digging, there's a lot to be found there.
4	Hated my office job, left a year ago and set up my own business walking dogs, now I love my job! 
2	Currently 10 months in to my first post uni full time job (software developer). Really not a fan. Like you, it never ends. Solve a massive problem? Cool here's another one. It's head down, code, basically all day. Frantically searching for a way out but have no idea what to do. It's brought on some pretty extreme anxiety. Seeing a therapist, have a meeting with career counselor tomorrow night, but not sure any of it will help.\n\nI've been thinking a lot about teaching but I don't even know if I'd enjoy that. Plus, it's another 2 years of school. How would I pay for rent and tuition on top of doing schoolwork?
2	I currently enjoy my office job because of the people I work with. They have a good sense of humour and we have some interesting chats. It's a new job for me, so still a novelty. Once that wears off I will start getting bored and looking for something else.\n\n\nI was in my previous office job for 13 years and hated it by the end. I provided well for my family during those years, so i'm proud of myself for staying. Next job will be something fulfilling though :)\n
2	I never had a job that lasted more than 18 months in the last 15 years. Sometimes I even restarted my career path from scratch and got back to the top.\nDon‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a problem, I just follow my feelings, I don‚Äôt want to waste my time on something I hate.
1	Bureaucrat, been here for over a year and a half. If I had to give my job a rating, its a 7/10. If I didn't have a good manager that I vibe with then it would be closer to a 4. \n\nThe benefits to my job are the union protections and benefits associated with my work. I work no more than 40 hours per week and never take my work home with me, stress or materials. I have guaranteed pay increases and decent vacation/time off. My hours are flexible but subject to manager approval and leave requests are rarely not permitted. The job I do isn't hard but sometimes I do have to do some creative thinking, just not as much as I'd like. \n\nThe things I don't like are the monotony and repetitive nature of the job. Also that I'm incentivized to stay in my position rather than move up in the organization, or else forgo several of those benefits without much in the way of additional pay. \n\nIf I were to leave my job and stay in the same sector it would be for a few jobs, I have those in mind and look for updates on those positions occasionally. If I were to leave my line of work all together it'd be for something that I could dedicate my life to, that whole "get paid for playing" thing where I love what I do. But it would take some time to develop that skill in my free time to confidently change my life direction. 
1	In a professional trainer and it‚Äôs perfect! Train new people every month and see them randomly throughout work. In front of people a lot and constantly making my trainings better. Plus the network I have is full of people like me. Awesome gig 
8	Does anyone else relate to this?	I just found this article: [http://www.hsperson.com/pages/1May06.htm](http://www.hsperson.com/pages/1May06.htm)\n\nand it hit home. It is about being a Highly Sensitive Person and also a High Sensation Seeker. People can be either, both, or none. If you want to take the quizzes, here they are: [HSP quiz](https://hsperson.com/test/highly-sensitive-test/), [HSS quiz](https://hsperson.com/test/high-sensation-seeking-test/)\n\nBasically, a highly sensitive person is very careful, gets overwhelmed easily, and needs to recharge frequently. A high sensation seeker readily seeks out novelty, wants to explore, and can get restless or bored easily. I've just taken the tests and found I am both, and the article I linked talks about what it's like to be both -- these two parts of you are constantly at odds, and make your life and knowing what you want kinda challenging. But they also end up working together to make you a more well rounded person. And this sounds almost exactly like what being an ENFP is like. Being a HSS sounds a whole lot like Ne. And being an HSP sounds a lot like Fi. Not that they're exactly the same, but it seems like this would be the type of thing that a lot of ENFP's could relate to. Do you?
3	Yes, I totally relate.  I've had these two sides at war for a long time.\n\nI started life very ambitious driven, but I didn't like how obnoxious I could be.  In my twenties I had some family trauma and started hiding myself.\n\nI've been on the upswing, redeveloping myself, and I've found these two halves result in me "looking good" so that people actually admire who I am as a person, the way I am around them and how I listen.  I think it has to do with how comfortable I am in any situation and with unstoppable optimism.\n\nI've found I can actually use this to have great success in any area of life I choose.  Now I can just pick a direction and excel.
191	Does anyone else get short term depression after coming home from a friends' gathering?	Like you've spent the day with your friends at the zoo, amusement park or wherever... and then once you come home, you sort of go into a mild depressive state, feeling really alone, wishing that you were still with your friends
39	I get this so bad when friends/family stay over and then leave. Once they leave I get so so sad. It‚Äôs better when my roommates are there, but still sucks! 
22	Not for me. I come home and enjoy quality alone time. Making tea, listening to music, cleaning, get stoned, playing games, etc.
11	It's just called missing people. Not everything is depressive or feelings of depression. I think that's something a lot of us ENFPs do, which is read way too into our emotions and feel a need to label them, with a touch of exaggeration. We can just miss the people and miss the activity but still know it will happen again and in the mean time  we can still enjoy other things. 
11	is "quality time" your love language?\n\nif yes, this is not so strange a reaction as you may think.
8	Yes all the time. Last summer I went on a trip with friends for a week and had an awesome time. When I got home I was depressed for like a good full week! Sometimes I'll have a really great day out and about with some friends and I'll get depressed that evening when I get home... Glad I'm not alone! haha
5	Mate, I get that whenever I come home from going out for a walk! haha.  I think it's just, like, a kind of come-down?
9	Actually, I‚Äôm the opposite. I sometimes tend to talk so much and spend so much time with family, friends and people that I go to my introvert state for a while, and just want to read, watch series or play DotA by myself.
4	I get this sometimes in the early evening or afternoon when I know my "outside the house/social/productive" part of the day is over, and all I have coming up is routine and bed time lol.\n\nIt's mostly a weeknight thing. On the weekends I know I can go out and make plans for that night or something, at the very least stay up late and do something super productive. But on weekdays I know that's usually a bad idea, or that others won't be up for anything---and I'll just feel really boxed in/stifled by having to do something tomorrow, and what that means about what I can do right now.\n\nI *know* that having a routine is good for me in a lot of ways, but some afternoons just staring down the barrel of it- it just looks like a distinct lack of possibilities, and I get depressed, and itchy to do literally anything else. This is when most of my impulsive bad decisions are made lol.
3	Yeah! I can‚Äôt stand being alone and actually get really terrified when people just leave me hanging.
3	Absolutely. Even if I wanted to be alone in the first place.\n\nMy wife is my best friend. We do everything together. If I go to work, I am fine. But if my wife goes to work and I am by myself at home, I will feel unmotivated and lonely until she gets home.\n\nI feel like we are basically just golden retrievers in people form.
3	Sometimes. I get it worse when I come back from vacations or go to concerts. It's not ever about missing people, though.\n\nI get so excited to go on vacation/to the concert, and I think of all the possibilities I could have or people I could meet in my new location. I get this overwhelming feeling that "something great is going to happen! üòÑ"  I always have a good time but those expectations usually aren't ever fulfilled so I feel sad when coming home. Knowing I'm going back to "normal" life doesn't help. 
3	YES
3	someone said ittttt yes
3	YES ITS THE WORST
2	Yeah. I'm finally getting over a two week spell of depression caused by exactly that. 
2	yeaaa :)
2	Hell yes!!!!! Man this for my whole life. 
2	I think I get those feelings because I‚Äôve just gotten so much energy from being with my friends that when I get home I have nothing to put it towards. It‚Äôs like coming down from a high but you don‚Äôt want to experience the come down. The problem is that I never know what to do with myself. And if I just mosey around I definitely start feeling depressed and lonely. But if I force myself to DO something, just one thing, I can typically keep myself engaged with that one thing or find other things to do until that energy high wears off. 
2	Yes. I get this a lot when leaving family after a visit. I take myself off to bed early cause I know it will be gone by the next day.
2	Yes. I get sad because its over :( trying to learn to see the good bits of the moments helps üòäüíõ
2	You gotta learn to enjoy your own company, friend. I enjoy dancing by myself, cooking, watching my shows, playing video games, being on Reddit even. 
1	I used to. Now I cherish being alone.
1	I'm familiar with this, I suggest continue developing being "with yourself" by challenging how you interact with your friends, be more self revealing.\n\nThe more I've self-revealed, been authentic and opened myself to rejection the more I've found I'm actually perfectly happy being alone.  I think it's because of a variety of reasons, the more I open up the more I realize people actually like the real me, which gives confidence for me to be alone.
1	That's exactly how I feel as well. Whoever have figured out how to deal with this, please share your experience. As someone who sadly spend most of my time by myself at home, this affects me almost every day and it sucks!
4	Do you guys leave gatherings that went well and wonder if they all think you‚Äôre nuts or awful?	
6	Only all the fucking time, especially meeting new people. I have to ask my friends who were with me, was I awkward? Was I weird? They almost always say no. I wish I didn't care what people thought so much.
3	Brah I leave work everyday and I know everyone thinks I'm nuts haha 
2	I used to. It is a self esteem thing coupled with social anxiety. But think about this, after that gathering were you thinking about others there and thinking they were nuts or awful? Probably not. You're just thinking about yourself and how you came across. And guess what? So is everyone. Everyone only focuses on themselves just like you do so no one is thinking bad about you like that. (unless you hurt someone)
2	It happened to me a lot when I was a teen or early 20s, not anymore though, it was also happening that I was literally running  after leaving the party.  Now usually avoid the ones that I might feel I might leave. 
2	I used to be worried that people who met me may have thought I was strange.  These days I remove all doubt. 
6	I despise Dating apps	I have to much optimism and get ghosted for being a good person. Why.......
7	Wdym by good person? 
7	Yep. I just deleted most of my dating apps Ive tried cause I cant deal with this shit anymore. I just cant disconnct myself from the individual to not take it personally when I get ghosted. I feel like Id have more success in real life. Which sucks cause I was on those apps in the first place cause I dont have time to find new people to meet
4	Being ghosted isn't just in dating apps, it happens in real life a lot as well. Doesn't matter if you're a good or bad person, if someone doesn't feel a connection with you, it doesn't matter how "good" you are. Also, from my experience on dating apps and having had relationships come forth from that, I can say that people who are on such apps in the first place or often either thirsty or lonely. They just want a partner they connect with. I've never had genuine or authentic relationships. Wasted my fucking time. Just live your life, don't "look" for love, it will happen if it happens. 
3	Use relationship sites like OKCupid, not apps. People actually looking to date someone seriously.
1	Anybody else in love with parks and recreation?! üòÑ	I just decided to started watching a couple of weeks ago and I'm about to finish it and I have loved every single second of it hands down the best characters in this world I love Leslie so much,  how do you type them tho? \n\nI think Leslie must be ENFJ, and I identify with both Chris and Andy I think they both are very two different types of ENFP 
2	hahahaha my best friend is an Enfp and i'm an Enfj parks and recs is hilarious I def agree with the correlation
1	I haven't seen Parks and Rec yet, but I am in love with another show by the same creator ( Greg Daniels and Michael Schur are the creators of P&C), *this other Michael Schur show is know as* ***The Good Place.***\n\nI am just sharing The Good News, that is all üòÑ
1	ENFP GUYS.	What are some signs you like someone? \n\nINTJ (F) here.
6	I will joke around a lot. Flirt. Be a bit risque sometimes. A lot of emojis and emoticons. Winky faces. Smiley faces. I will also ask lots of questions because I want to learn everything about her, and to tell her everything about me.\n\nBut that is online. In person I usually am socially anxious.
3	I'll ask them on a date.\n\nIf you have an ENFP you suspect likes you, I think we're easily coaxed out about our true feelings if you're bold enough to pursue us.  There are plenty of women I'm attracted to right now but I'm not dating because I don't feel stable financially, I've decided not to pursue anyone until I get that settled.\n\nWhich obviously has nothing to do with them and everything to do with me.
2	Jokes! Questions, can't stop smiling like an idiot, being extra excited around you, trying to make you feel safe and confortable, physical contact of any kind I usually play with the hair of the girl I like or her jewerly
2	ENFP male here,\n\nI've read the other comments and that while the push and pull (once we acknowledge the fact that we actually 'like like' you).... usually happens in the beginning... (it will subside later). \n\nWe are naturally curious about people in general so we do ask questions. If we like you in that way, we would observe you distantly and increase our questions. We will know you more than others (and yes **all** your little quirks and tendencies... )\n\nWhen I like you at first, I would tone myself down and be a bit shy)... but eventually become my enfp self again. \n\nYeah I could do text...but more often than not find it difficult to sustain text conversations. However...if we talk in real life... i can't shut up lol. I could talk for hours. So if you call an ENFP .... then ... lol. You know. \n\nAnyway, in my current situation, this all happened to this ISTJ girl that I liked (and still like... and taking it real slow). \n\nFeel free to ask any other questions. \n\n&#x200B;
2	If I'm asked by someone I like, I tell them I like them. Or maybe I beat them to the punch and tell them I like them. And I guess sometimes I just don't say anything because I'm afraid of rejection.
2	More jokes. Likes to spend a lot of time around/with you. More talking than normal - like texting, calling, etc. 
2	I'm an ENFP girl but one of my best friends is en ENFP guy. I've seen him flirt with girls. If he's not that into them, it's pretty basic flirting like everyone else does. But when he falls for a girl, he's a ball of cringe. He'll turn into a needy puppy, do anything for them without questioning their motives, be excessive in general, etc... But yeah, mainly cringey lovely dovey. Wants to be around them 24/7, will ditch all of his plans to be with her, kinda gets lost in fantasies and dreams.
1	just wondering how ENFPs would respond to this	[u/throwaway3n1p](https://www.reddit.com/u/throwaway3n1p) and I are currently working on gathering answers for how thought processes work in different MBTI types. This is just out of curiosity, not an attempt to stalk you according to how you think of grave crimes. All replies are appreciated!\n\nIf we count judgments of *moral obligation* out of the equation, \n\nQuestion 1: How is murder logically fine?\n\nQuestion 2: How is murder logically wrong?\n\nNOTE: Feel free to write down whatever thought you have, whether it is emotional or just plain retarded.
3	I‚Äôm an infp and your ass knows what I‚Äôm fin say ‚Äúit is wrong it ‚Äòfeels‚Äô wrong‚Äù and I stand by that
3	1: It depends on context. If they were going to kill me I might kill them first instead. Though not necessarily if I can avoid it. Survival. Defense. If someone hurt or killed someone I know I might want to kill them and maybe go through with it. This is based on feeling and also on preventing them from hurting/killing others in future.\n\n2: Again depends on context. But for me I make decisions based on the golden and silver rules. I treat people how I would want to be treated and don't treat people how I would not want to be treated. So murder is bad to me because I would not want to be murdered so I can logically assume others don't as well if they have similar views/conditions as me, in this case that they are also alive like me.
3	1. Murder is only logically fine to me if it were in self defence, or a situation like euthanasia where someone has asked or pleaded for it, terminally ill or similar, knowing their life would be an intense burden to themselves and others if they went on. It's hard for me to call euthanasia 'murder' but it is the act of taking a life of another, albeit with permission.\n2. Murder is logically wrong because it takes a human's life against their will.
3	Define murder.  The way phrased the question is not consistent.\n\nI think what you're asking is when is murder justified and not justified.\n\nAnd the answer is clear:  Whenever someone says so.  And when someone says it isn't.\n\nThe universe doesn't label murder as wrong, justified or anything.  It just is.  People add meaning to the action.\n\nI also can't speak for every ENFP as we are wired based on our values.  On this particular subject my value is to be fair.  Thus it depends on the agreement from person to person.
2	Of course, I could come up with scenarios where murder would logically defensible, but I'd argue against them all because there's likely a way to avoid murder in most cases. And, I would avoid it at nearly any cost to myself.  \n\nThat said, if someone I loved had already murdered someone and came to me for help, I'd figure out why helping to get rid of the body and hide evidence is logically defensible. At least I think I would, it's never happened. 
2	1.when protecting someone specially a loved one, when protecting yo self\n2.any other case is wrong
2	1. Logically right in case of self defense, and you don't have enough time to reason to decide.\n2. Logically wrong because even if you gather many reason for the the murder of that person from your own perspective, you perspective can change, the variables can change and in one minute after a murder a new factor could be added to the problem which invalidates the original reasoning and also there are so many domino effects and consequences that you cannot predict. 
2	It's all about what of whose point of views and in what scenarios, there is no definite right or wrong\n\nIf stepping into psychopaths' shoes it may seem even merciless killings are logically ok, because base on their logic, they r just doing what they desire n bring them thrill, which make them happu\n\nHowever if according to average people's moral, then ofc hell no and can't be able to comprehend such actions\n\nAnd if a brutal murderer killed someone innocent, the victim's loved ones then decided to have their own "execution". You can say no one has the right to end another person's life, but in fact this sounds very justifiable to me
2	Murder is never okay in my book, even if it's about murderers or pedophiles or the worst kind of people. I just don't think it's up to us to decide over ending a human being. Also, I think murdering someone for that reason would be too easy for that person. They just die, didn't pay for what they did. I think locking them up in solitude until they die (naturally) is a better punishment. The only exception I can think of, is if it's in self-defense, or maybe even to save the life of someone dear to you.
2	1) Auto defense is a good example. Say you are being followed by a serial killer who is extremely dangerous and you have a gun in your hand. You're not just gonna stand there and get killed so you shoot them. Also death penalty for extremely dangerous people, those who are in no way gonna stop killing, is ok too.\n\n2) Taking people's lives, especially innocent people (however even the biggest assholes don't deserve death), is wrong. You are taking someone's life, stopping them from ever enjoying good moments around their family, friends or even acquaintances. You are putting a lot of sadness, funeral taxes and a void in the hearts of who knew that person. 
2	I have an eye for an eye mentality. If you kill someone I'm not going to judge the family member or friend that comes after you. Sure it's not great but I understand it. 
1	What is logic anyway? Whose is it to decide? Is logic what most people FEEL has the most sense? Is it more logical to defend yourself or humanity as a whole? Who is it more logical to?\n\nSo I guess for humanity it would be best to kill people who endanger our survival and progress in any way. That would for example mean killing the weak as dealing with them takes away time and they can mess something up very easily. And going with this reasoning it would be wrong to kill a person who brings value to the tribe. But then again what is valuable? That's the F stuff.\n\nFor a single person it would again be about survival, but of that particular individual. For them they are most valuable so it's "logical" to kill anyone who could hurt them and wrong to kill someone who can help them.\n\nBut there is no objective logic so we can't accurately tell. Fine and wrong are values anyway.
1	Motivational Monday!	\nToday is a new day! A fresh week! An opportunity start something new and get back into life. \n\nWhat inspires you, /r/ENFP?\n\nPost stories, quotes, and images that give you life. Need a little rally? Don't be shy posting your goals; let /r/ENFP give you a pep talk!\n
2	Stay Vibrant! Stay High ! 
4	How do I take advantage of gaps in my schedule?	Posted this yesterday on r/ADHD but no one commented so I thought you guys might have a similar issue.\n  \nHI all!\n  \nSo I'm a college student with a pretty busy schedule, and I often times find myself with gaps in my schedule where I have an hour or more until the next thing that I have to do, and I have no idea how to make myself be productive during that time.\n  \nFor example, today is Saturday and I went to this public conference thing at 9 and I stayed until 11. Then at 1 pm I was supposed to get a ride from a friend to go volunteering. I could not get myself to do anything during that time and I ended up on Reddit or whatever. Couldn't even get myself to answer emails. 1 rolls around and I volunteered until 4 pm.\n  \nThen I got myself to the library and had everything I needed in front of me to start studying for my midterm on Monday. Instead, I go to get food. Check email. Check if any new grades are posted. Mostly stayed on Reddit.\n\nAt around 6:30, I finally got myself to study a little bit by reading the first chapter. Barely got through it and finished around 7pm. And now I don't feel like starting another chapter because I have to be somewhere from 8 to 10pm. After that, I have to be somewhere from 12am to 2am and I'm sure I'll just end up on reddit from 10-12.\n  \nThis is pretty much everyday. I love being involved and doing things and being around people, but that doesn't leave me big chunks of time where I can just study. And when I do have a few free hours, I can't get myself to study because I know that I'll have to stop because I have to be somewhere soon.\n  \nSigh, any other students feeling the same?\n  \nEdit: Englishness
2	You‚Äôre simply procrastinating :-)\n\nYou have several hours gaps, 2 hours each! How about challenging yourself to achieve some small task in that time? Eg: get books and shit in 5 mins, then: read 10 pages in 30 mins, or something like that.\n\nSet a clear goal and a time constraint, then do it.
1	This is something I‚Äôve had to mess with as well, also being hella busy in college with very strangely-timed voids in the schedule.\n\nAnd honestly at some point, the ENFP tendency is to desperately want to fill that void with production and progress, but I‚Äôve found that it‚Äôs actually quite a bit healthier, at least for my overall mood, just to take those break times when I can, and to focus on resetting mentally and easing off the gas a little bit. \n\nI find that after mindlessly scrolling through Reddit/Twitter/etc for an hour, I‚Äôm refreshed and in a better mood instead of pushing myself to do something I‚Äôm simply not motivated for or interested in doing. It just makes whatever comes out of that worse, so I‚Äôm just better off saving it for when I‚Äôm actually passionate about said project.\n\nTL;DR, take advantage of the gaps to rest and reset, instead of always trying to do more.
1	I say dont fill all the gaps! Obviously keep studing and doing the work but dont feel like every second of your day needs to be "productive." I didn't really figure this out until my senior year but when I gave myself permission to enjoy myself and not stress about grades and activities constantly I ended up having way better grades than before. I would also recommend going to free tutors and study groups. Knowing office hours are scheduled for a set time helped me be more productive and focus. Plus you can ask questions and get some human contact in. \n\nDo you have any hobbies? I used to carry knitting with me so I could do something in my down time. I even ended up selling some because enough people took notice and wanted something. I'm also big on reading/listening to books. I love sitting in busy places with a book. \n\n(Added study bonus; doing a repetitive task that doesnt involve much thought, like walking, helps you retain information. That's originally why I started bringing knitting around, so I could knit and listen to recorded classes.) \n
103	It be like that.	
3	Awww üòç
3	I like my optimism.. I‚Äôm not a fan of bad moods, at all - I feel off lol
1	Today's
1	Super wholesome and sweet.
1	Soooooo sweet !! It's heart breaking !! \n\nIndefectible faith yay
12	TIL that ENFPs are Sith	
4	ENFP Grey Jedi here, hi
3	Sith code is way cooler.
3	This is funny...  but I think we "use the sith code" so we can get access to living in the "jedi code"
1	"You underestimate my power...!"
1	I am not touching the issue of what type Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader is.
1	Yeah, definitely Sith. Except through Passion I gain Knowledge. But Knowledge is power, so same thing. ;)
83	What‚Äôs a really ‚ÄúENFP‚Äù thing you did this week?	I just spent an hour on my sunny patio, playing ukulele songs about my ex-lover to a bunch of pretty songbirds.
92	I gave compliments to people who might not have deserved them, but surely needed them.
75	Got massively depressed over a cancelled plan and obsessed if I'm losing that person as a friend. 
60	I tried not to smother someone I deeply care about, by writing long long messages, confessing and complaining and reasoning and sending to myself. 
38	I had my performance review at work and my manager said "I really don't think you even know how to be mean to someone." Shes right.
23	I think I spilled all the details of my life to a girl on the first date :/
24	I also played the ukulele, for like 5 hours yesterday instead of doing homework :)
23	I became the DM for a D&D game, on a whim.
21	I chose a new roommate totally on vibe. She felt like another ENFP too. 
16	I talked down a friend who was freaking out after relapsing into some self-harm behaviors. I gave him practical advice for the immediate situation, and then had a whole discussion about bigger picture, abstract things to make him feel better about himself and get his mind off of the present moment.
13	I was doing homework at one of our university cafes and a woman had a seizure right next to me. The whole time it was happening, I held her hand, made eye contact, and reminded her that she was going to be okay. After it was all over, I gave her a hug. I‚Äôve thought about it every single day since. 
15	Good timing! I bought spur-of-the-moment tickets for Cursed Child in New York for this summer and now I'm planning a trip around that purchase. Thank you for asking. 
12	Also played the ukelele! Singing silly songs like The show - Lenka, with my cat enjoying the music by my side. Thinking about my friends and family and how much I love them
12	I sang a bunch of songs to my coworkers in an Arnold Schwarzenegger voice earlier this week (Bohemian Rhapsody, My Heart Will Go On, some Savage Garden...), then today with other coworkers I made "posh farm animal" noises (like saying "BAWK bawk" as if I'm a rich lady clutching her pearls).
11	I sang and danced along to Disney music to amuse  my daughter and my mom‚Äôs puppies. They all watched like I was crazy but my daughter insisted I continue, that they loved it. You had to be there. Writing it out, I‚Äôm over thinking it and not sure if I should hit send. Or why I‚Äôm even writing so much. But yea. Sorry!
11	I listened to EDM music on Friday morning at 8:30 am and sent my friends a Snapchat asking how they were starting their Friday morning commute. I was jammin out!! Lol
10	Try to make sure everyone had a good time at this goddamn party.
9	Invited my friend over after he got some bad news until 2 am when I normally go to bed at 10 and then couldn‚Äôt sleep after because we had such a good conversation and he felt better at the end and I was amped up with positive vibes.
9	Was overly nice to someone who had zero energy and negative vibes. Also was offended that a coworker did not give me any positive energy or even a smile 
9	I practiced conducting for 5 hours last night.. I don't know a thing about music.
7	I start a new job with an old teacher as my boss on Monday  - there was a failed/never went through romantical situation last semester and I haven‚Äôt seen him since.  I‚Äôve spent the whole week trying to figure out our future relationship dynamic (without having actually started there yet) - maybe we can be friends, maybe I will be uber professional to the point of being cold, maybe by the end of the year I will like him again, maybe he can go back to acting like a teacher, etc.... It‚Äôs exhausting.
8	Went to a wedding. Met an acquaintance's wife for the first time. She didn't know many people, so I spent an hour chatting to her to make her feel welcome and found out loads of cool things out about her. And I got a recommendation for a great book in the process.\n\nAt the wedding I also met another woman, found out she's learning French, discussed learning languages as an adult, found out she goes to a club to play board games in French, got her number, will go play board games in French with her and the club at some point in the future.
13	Used the Socratic method at work to share new intuitions without appearing too uppity.
6	This morning I was on my back porch and my cat was meowing at me through the window screen. That usually means he wants me to bring him grass but he continued to meow after I provided him with some. So I put an old pink collar on him and made a leash out of some lanyards and brought him outside with me üòÇ I think that might be an enfp thingü§î 
7	Got asked out by someone i maaaayyybe liked but wasn‚Äôt sure, said i wasn‚Äôt in emotional shape to be dating right now after previous damaging relationship, then got asked out by another person i was almost positive i liked, said yes, and am now freaking out doubting any and all truth in my feelings. oh, yeah, and writing songs about it all through this whole process. 
7	I got flown out to another state for an annual event for one of my clients. \n\nDuring some of the talks people gave I tried my best to stay focused and not get bored. I do confess that when no one was looking/caring I derped on the internet, researching things. When I'm not moving, I'm easily bored. \n\nWhen it was my turn to talk on things I got filled with energy, spoke with a lot of power, and commanded attention. It felt amazing. I've been a bit stressed recently which is why I struggled also with focusing on others & connecting with others when I wasn't in the stage. \n\nI also got all kinds of random ideas for the client while talking to other people in the company. I currently have 3 pages worth of ideas and misc. to-do's. \n\nI'm fairly certain I met another ENFP, or someone with Ne leading because they gave me some great ideas on how I could make more money with the client. I also wrote those down, and am excited to implement them. \n\nWe had a party after, I danced like crazy. Everyone later told me I'm the "life of the party" and made it awesome. I didn't even realize how much people were liking my party vibes because I also had to hide in the bathroom and cry over some things I got sad about during the party. \n\nAfter the party I discovered some things from my ex-girlfriend in my backpack that were in a hidden compartment. I cried about the happiest times of my life (not just because of her, but because of the country I was living in, other friends, money, etc.) and threw them off the balcony. \n\nI prayed to God or the Universe or whatever that I would find my direction and place again. When I was living in my ex's country things were amazing. Now I'm a bit lost, and that's scary. I've been spending a lot of time in a dominant-tertiary loop, so it felt great to just cry and Fi on the hotel balcony while symbolically releasing the things my ex gave to me. \n\nOh but I also put on the things my ex had gave me before throwing it out, and waited for like 20 minutes to remove them in case some sign came that I should keep them. No sign came. I released it. It was sad, but now I feel more relieved and relaxed. It's time to move on, not just from her, but from the happiest time in my life. I've felt a lot of purposeless and confusion recently but it's time to start moving forward rather than getting stuck in a loop of the past. \n\nI then felt great and went back down to the lobby to go to the after party, but then decided I'd rather spend time alone and regenerate my Fi. Then I had the idea to play a video game, so I played CS:GO. We won the first game, which was awesome. The second game we didn't win. \n\nI also remembered yesterday when I played there were some very mean players and it hurt, which is logically silly because it's a game but I still didn't like it and it makes no sense to be mean to others! Whenever I get matched with a positive team we always win. \n\nAlso someone at the banquet was really nervous so I cheered him up. He was really nervous to publicly speak which shocked me because he seemed so confident one on one. He finally gave his speech, but during the speech I was hiding in the bathroom crying. I still gave compliments. \n\nI also made sure to give everyone compliments on their dance moves, and they genuinely were good! It was fun. A lot of people were nervous but they were all loosened up by the end. \n\nI really connected a lot more with my feeling & authentic core self today, and it was great. I'm going to meditate and connect deeper, then sleep. I'm going to sleep in, and, being an ENFP, have no plans at all for tomorrow but several ideas for what to do. \n\n\n\n
6	I got entranced by two golden colored dogs dancing around in the first sunlight we‚Äôd seen in days. 
6	I just got back from a date with an adorable bearded tattooed INFP hipster where we talked about life, the universe and everything, sang while I was waiting for the train at the station to keep myself warm, then got home and watered my plants from the bottom up in a glass baking dish with rose quartz placed around them so they could feel extra good vibes.
5	Dancing to good music 50% of the time in a day; use photo editing apps to make a funny picture regarding a "scenery " that just hit my mind; decided to grab a coffee even when i was probably going to be late, then there were many ppl at the coffee shop so I ended up really late, then i failed to get a cab since it was raining and the traffic was very bad,  at the end I did not make it to the meeting
5	I impulse bought myself some children‚Äôs sandals and packed an entire suitcase for a trip I don‚Äôt leave for until March 16th üòÇ 
4	I love it when I play harmonica and birds come sing with me.
5	Hmmm... an ENFP thing I would have done would be to forgive that toxic friend of mine for the hundredth time, dedicate and give my all despite it not being appreciated and reciprocated, and then being susceptible to being manipulated and taken advantaged by her again. (because I'm idealistic like that)\n\nInstead, I did the opposite, and I decided to distance myself away from her, without lashing out and pouring my negative emotions onto her.\n\nAnd it's still an ENFP thing, constantly reflecting  and realising my areas of improvement. 
4	I love reading your texts! I can relate to everythiiiing
4	Just finished my part time job for the last time, I can't thank enough to people who have worked with me. I keep telling them how thankful I am. It makes me sad how they said they will miss me and keep supporting me. I just never good at parting :( 
4	I talked incessantly about something I'm struggling right now with every single person I spent more than 5 minutes with, over-analysing and over-sharing. And then, as a consequence, worried about whether my over-talking of it has been annoying and worrying about that as well as the original problem.
3	Went to a marriage retreat as a single male just for the free drinks and conversations this weekend. 
7	Got an exam on Monday, stayed up all night picking random locks on campus.
3	I feel that \n
3	I got pretty sad and into a pretty bad mood as I was in a new environment and didn‚Äòt find any friends yet. It was pretty boring as things didn‚Äòt happen (fellow ENFPs probably know what I‚Äòm talking about). Started to search for the reason in my apparently weird behavior and appearance. 
3	I went and played volleyball with a bunch of strangers.  We had way too many subs so I helped come up with a king of the court kind of thing and helped get everyone on board.  I was super encouraging, every time we‚Äôd mess up I‚Äôd say ‚Äújust shake it off‚Äù or ‚Äúnext time, we freaking got this.‚Äù  And afterwards I left with a girls number.  
3	I'm a dentist and when I came back from work today I decided it'd be fun to do voice acting as a side hobby and spent several hours sending out audition clips to different jobs looking for people... 
3	I'm an assistant language teacher in Japan. I can barely communicate with my students, but I still love them a lot! Last Friday, a bunch of the parents came to observe class. I made a goal to meet as many parents as possible!! I met about 15 out of 50 before they all left. Rip. I'm just hella grateful to have google translate's voice input!
3	Took at least 17 breaks while working on a report I'm supposed to finish for my university. Needless to say I got nothing done.
3	Planned a lot of things.\n\nDid nothing.
2	Sleep, about 4 times, good 40 hours down the draina
2	I hosted a surprise birthday party for my best friend who‚Äôs also an ENFP with my other ENFP best friend! I‚Äôve never seen somebody so happy before!!! 
2	I‚Äôm just really excited üòÇ 
2	I cleaned and organized my house, got into the flow, started on some repurposing and DIYs projects and completely ignoring my actual work which the deadline is tomorrow. And I‚Äôm here on reddit instead of doing it.
1	Listen to loud, inspirational music while drinking coffee and letting my imagination run wild with fantastic possibilities for the future. \n\nAlso, ripped into my INTJ friend for acting like a condescending dick on a topic about which he knows nothing, but happens to be my profession. Thought about feeling bad; decided not to give a fuck because I need to speak up for myself more. 
1	I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs my enfp or my chaotic goodness but\n\nI developed a cavity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd my dentist is my mom ‚ù§Ô∏è whoops
1	I told everyone on my social media that I loved them all and appreciated their being around and supporting me and being there for me coupled with a cute meme (I have severe depression).
1	I laughed at a joke that I remembered while walking home for 10 minutes straight.And then I smiled at a stranger who was staring at me with disbelief.I don't remember why I did that *facepalms*
1	Bought a set of bloomer panties/bra so I could feel like a princess every day :) even if they are a little impractical!
3	Favorite ENFP-friendly Fiction and Movies?	Reading an amazing book right now that is giving me all the ENFPfeels and I wanted to seek out recommendations for books, especially fiction, and movies that you all enjoy particularly because you‚Äôre an ENFP. \n\nI‚Äôm reading J.P. Monninger‚Äôs The Map That Leads to You. It‚Äôs a love story I suppose but it‚Äôs also about traveling in Europe, exploring, self-discovery, and making deep connections. Reminds me of the movie Elizabethtown, which is my all-time favorite movie. I want to make a soundtrack to a road trip like Claire did!\n\nAnyways-all suggestions welcome!
3	Idk if this has anything to do with being ENFP, but my current favorite movie is Fantastic Mr. Fox ü¶ä 
2	Are you male or female?\n\nFor males I'd suggest tightly plotted, big interconnected stories.\n\nHarry Potter, Mistborn series, The Expanse.\n\nFor a female I might suggest The Uglies series by James Patterson which has a great female protagonist who evolves brilliantly.\n\nFor movies anything by Christopher Nolan and Alex Garland (these may be more for males)\n\nFrom my experience ENFP tastes can range depending on your personality and gender.
1	What are your eating/exercise habits like?	Curious if there are any similar trends/patterns :)\n\nI will provide my own when I'm not in the middle of eating lol
3	I eat with impulse. Meaning that I don‚Äôt always make the healthiest decisions. I usually have to have a goal in mind to exercise. I don‚Äôt usually exercise for the sake of it, unless it aligns to some kind of future vision I have. 
1	I try to pick the most nutritious option when I go out, I do count calories and go to the gym 6 days a week.\nOne day I was like damn I fat, and in the back of my head I always liked to picture myself in the body of a superhero, so I just said fuck it ill do some jumping Jack's, it felt so fucking good to move after a while I did the next day too, and then the next and so on until I felt in love with watching my strength and muscles grow, it's been 2 years now and I finally feel like a superhero and don't want to stop! üòÑ\n\nBut I also allow my self a cheat meal a week.  Usually a very big and super delicious one. 
1	I try to incorporate whole grains and lots of veggies into my meals. I found that since going vegetarian and trying to be more vegan, my health has skyrocketed because I‚Äôm eating a lot more filling and healthy substitutes. I eat three meals a day, only because I‚Äôm at college and need to go to the dining hall. I don‚Äôt let myself buy snacks often because I have a tendency to eat everything that is available to me.\n\nAnd this isn‚Äôt an eating habit but I consume lots and lots of coffee because I love feeling energized.\n\nI also force myself to run by signing up for 10Ks that I know I‚Äôll have to train for. Lol it‚Äôs a love-hate relationship.
1	How do you guys let go/move on from a relationship?	It might be an ENFP thing to hold onto past relationships for too long (at least I do it lol). How do you learn to let go? Any advice is greatly appreciated. My boyfriend broke up with me 6 months ago and I still find myself not over it - we only dated 4 months. AGH. 
3	Easier to say than doing it but here‚Äôs my advice: rationalize the situation. Analyze your feelings, where you‚Äôre now and the fact that is game over. It will hurt, but it‚Äôs a sort of necessary pain. What doesn‚Äôt kill you, will make you stronger.\nWhen you‚Äôll be ready (soon is better than later), open to the infinite opportunities out there.
2	Find a new hobby, something interesting, getting myself busy with something new usually helps alot for not contacting the other person that you have analyzed that it is not rational to be with. And time solves things. For me it takes usually 5-6 months and then I would be super done! Also try not to contact your boyfriend not until you got over it.
2	It took me over 2 years to get over my ex, in some ways I'll always love her. But you have to be honest with yourself. Don't look back with rosy glasses. There was good but there was also bad. And I'm sure you know that if you think back on it honestly.
2	If someone decided to cut off a relationship, then he no longer worths your love n attention. I know this is easier said than done but as the same time its so true. He just doesnt care abt u
2	not just an enfp thing, but i think we tend to be nostalgic. my therapist helped me see the positive in my relationships instead of dwelling on the negatives (which is tempting, because it kind of makes it hurt less in short term). it's ok if it takes you longer to get over. there's no shame in it at all. 
2	Time I guess. Got out of a 6 year relationship a little over a year ago and only now am I getting better (maybe finding out I'm an ENFP has helped too). Finding ways to outlet creativity definitely helps the healing process.
1	Yes, but it's a hard one. You need to meet more new people and love yourself first.
8	I love him and I‚Äôm all-in	BUT I just KNOW it‚Äôs probably going to take while for him to feel that same level of passion/commitment/whatever back! (INTJs‚Äîyou know how they are)\n\nMy question for you guys is...how do you simmer down and keep from ‚Äúsmothering‚Äù your significant others with all the love you want to share??? \n\nAny advice in general for how to slow down and experience this relationship in its current state while also being respectful of unspoken boundaries?\n
6	Just do what you were just saying is right! Don‚Äôt jump down his throat and don‚Äôt let your own excitement control you. \n\nIf you have to know something, maybe it‚Äôs got to be subtle. Could be subtle and blatant: ‚ÄúI like you‚Äù \n\nMake yourself plain if you have to. If you don‚Äôt hear anything for a few days, stay chill. It‚Äôs that that you have to be cooler than
3	I always try to get all of the need to smother out when I‚Äôm with friends or family. I spend a LOT of time with friends and family, and it really helps. Of course you do just want to squeeze your INTJ at the end of the day, and definitely do that sometimes, but it definitely helps dampen the need to shower them with love. \n\nI‚Äôm in year 2 of an ENFP-INTJ relationship and we have found a good balance I think. I do still worry about suffocating him, especially because we live together, but he always seems happy with my clear effort to give him what he needs (aka space and alone time).
3	If it really is love, you don't need to rush. It's a good thing to remember when you get impulses. I try to remember that, as I've had to be very patient to get to the point where it was mutually expressed. \n\nAlso, if you want to explode with words, write it out to yourself (what you want to say) then wait 24 hours and see if you still REALLY need to say it. \n\nJust be aware of your intentions. Like is it something you really want to do/say or need to say. It can be hard to distinguish so giving yourself time and space is necessary. 
3	Remember to keep being you.\n\nAnd also be of service to his needs for no reason than to get what it is he really wants.  A healthy relationship is a partnership.
2	put urself in their shoes....... Look up the analysis and info abt intjs online then, try to understand how they work, then realize maybe some of our passionate love may become "smothering" to them. INTJs r rather detached n calm ppl, developing emtions too fast too intense with them may make u appear annoying, becoz it is just not how they function....... Us ENFPs r known for our flexibility right üòõ so just suit urself into their views of romantic relationships
1	Yea, that makes sense! Thanks for reminding me !
6	How do you thrive being single??	Soooooo, just got out of a four year relationship less than six months ago, and finding it incredibly hard being single since I‚Äôm so full of love and just want to share it with someone (even though I want to stay focused on myself and grow independently!) \n\nI‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs an enfp thing, or just me, but how do you guys find yourself balanced and happy being single? 
8	Focus your love on you! You sound like you are already doing that but it's true. Love yourself and focus on all other aspects of your life and grow. If you have friends and family you can show them love too. And if that's not enough there are many places to volunteer helping homeless people or animals.
4	>I'm so full of love and just want to share it with someone\n\nThis. I feel it. It's a struggle. Love yourself, and love your friends. Hang in there. Life has so many opportunities to share love. ‚ù§Ô∏è
3	I always HAD to be in a relationship for the same reason. I'm just so full of love and wanted to receive love so badly. But after my last relationship was kinda emotionally abusive, I realized I just settled for less to avoid loneliness. I've been single for almost a year now and I'm pretty happy. Like other comments said, I focused my love on myself. I spoiled myself, travelled to a country several times where my best friends are,... You have to learn to love yourself and find yourself. The next person I'd date, I want it to be the last person I'll ever date. So even if I'd meet someone, I want to take my time and really know them before I jump in another relationship because I know I deserve someone good. 
2	Ooo I definitely feel you on this! It is really really hard. I‚Äôve been focusing on self-development and achieving goals. And spending time with friends and family. I‚Äôve noticed that I have to be very careful about spending too much time alone because that‚Äôs when I feel weak and tempted to go and FIND SOMEONE üò¨ I‚Äôm kind of on the fence between going on 68 first dates just for the experience, and just saying fuckitall and go on road trips with my friends and listen to Lizzo and take hip hop cabaret dance classes. 
2	I found being of service to people has really helped, doing favors, expecting nothing back.\n\nI started personal coaching and breakthrough/transformational events which has made a HUGE impact for me as an ENFP.  I used to hang out with a bunch of gamers/film makers and my growth was extremely limited, I found putting myself into situations where I can listen to people's problems and help them has allowed me to develop self love\n\nAnd made me more stable when approaching any kind of relationship.\n\nMy suggestion is find a community where you can flourish and will learn not only self love, but how to be an amazing romantic partner.
2	I love being single! It's such an amazing time to do whatever the fuck you want whenever you want. Be selfish and do only the things that make you truly happy. :)
29	Survey on flirting	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
26	what are we supposed to be, love gods?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nps: I love you, good luck

5	dude holy shit that's a LOT of questions for like the *opportunity* of winning a giftcard.\n\nfilled it anyway. cheers.
5	Love your job. Jealous
4	Would you be able to update us with the results/findings later? I'm so curious
3	How long do you think it will take approximately? Don‚Äôt want to start it right now if I don‚Äôt have time to do it all in one sitting. Thank you!
3	Wow, I hate myself.  I filled out everything just to put the wrong username. There goes my 1% chance to win lol
3	This survey is not designed for people outside the US. 
2	Holy, so many questions. Also, LOL at this question. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/YmxUOKR.jpg
1	ayeeeee LA tech! filled it out, mcneese poke here! (yeeyee)
1	Loved it! A good run down memory lane of what it‚Äôs like to flirt with someone I‚Äôm into! 
5	What are you all like when you‚Äôre sick/ under the weather?	
4	I get pretty dramatic and feel like I‚Äôm going to die, or tough through it 
3	my partner says i‚Äôm the whiniest when i‚Äôm sick. not my fault i feel like death itself when i get a cold.
3	Anxiety ridden hypochondriac, walking anger or staying-in bed-forever-looking-like-a-sad-puppy.
2	i give myself plenty of rest
2	usually feel held back and kinda trapped. I hate feeling trapped. sometimes though, if I've been going too hard, I kind of like the excuse to do nothing.
2	I get the urge to want to do things I would usually put off, want to just lay and sleep, bounce from mood to mood, insist on staying awake, watch the same thing over and over.\n\nI'm a stressed out hypersensitive mess who fights needing to rest pretty much.
1	sad and watch a lot of twilight lol 
1	I ignore it and try to go about my day. If I‚Äôm really sick I‚Äôll stay in bed until the meds kick in and then go about my day and ignore it. Probably not the best thing to do, but I get incredible cabin fever when I‚Äôm sick.
2	Adventure Time Sunday!	\n/r/ENFP! What shenanigans have you been up to this week? Any new adventures planned for the next?\n\nLet's here some stories!
1	I have been shopping for my redditgifts giftee! I may or may not have spent $15 on stickers...
5	I'm feeling quite alone, anxious, and down in the dumps. What's something about being an ENFP that can make me more confident?	
6	Some things that make me feel more confident are wearing the clothes that make me feel like myself, express my personality on the things I do and make. I also try to be with my loved ones and spend time with the people I know won‚Äôt judge me.\nUse your extroverted part to connect with your mutuals, share your feelings and experiences. Sometimes we feel alone because we think no one will listen, but it is a really nice surprise when you tell your feelings to a friend and they show their affection and try to be more present in your life. If you count on your closest ones, they will try their best to be there for you.\nAlso use your optimist part to see the best on every situation and prevent the negativity from coming to you.\nFeeling like you are in a hole can be pretty addictive, so try not to fall to that kind of thoughts, it‚Äôs tricky and hard to get out of that point.\n\nGood luck, honey! I wish you the best <3
3	Be authentic with your friends.  Reveal things you haven't revealed before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis can also help you develop resistance to "rejection" and get you more in touch with yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also suggest programs like the Landmark Forum for ENFPs.  They are an education curriculum around developing effectiveness and self expression which ENFP's can struggle with, people also show up there with a host of personal problems we ENFP's love to fix.
4	OMG I came here to make a very similar post. Whatever you do, please don't isolate yourself!! Reach out! Get out of the house! :) 
3	This too shall pass. I go through phases such as that, the more downward spiral of my moods, but then you‚Äôve gotta have hope that you‚Äôll feel back in top of it later on. Try to not seclude yourself, do little things you normally enjoy, go outside, know that the world appreciates your energy and can‚Äôt wait to have you back :)
4	hurt and confused	I‚Äôve been friends with an ENFP (m) for over a year now. I‚Äôm an INFJ (f), however, throughout the course of our entire friendship, it‚Äôs just been a huge rollercoaster. I mean, he‚Äôs an interesting person and all but to his day I‚Äôm still unaware of what to feel towards him.\n\nInitially, when we first started talking, it escalated pretty fast. I was aware that he kind of had a crush on me, considering that his friends would tease him sometimes when I was around, and how he‚Äôd express more care for me compared to everyone else, paying attention to details, smiling when he‚Äôd see me. That was during the first 3-4 months. After that, it just kind of went downhill. He started to ignore me completely, as if he were playing push & pull. It was confusing, so I decided to close myself off until one day he told me that he regretted the way he treated me after seeing the consequences of it..i was confused because i was only protecting myself from getting hurt, i didnt mean to hurt him in the process.\n\nSo we proceeded for the next months to go on with our own lives and drift apart while also aware of each others‚Äô presence. It hurt in the beginning, a lot. More than i had thought. Maybe it was because we‚Äôd spend the majority of our time speaking to each other for 3 months straight. For the past few months, however, i started focusing on myself more. He was barely ever around. I had more time on my hands to spend with people i had formed new connections with.\n\nAnd now, we reconnected because he started coming back, putting in more effort than before to talk again. I‚Äôm just confused and hurt at the moment. Confused, because i‚Äôm not sure how he feels towards me. He still tries to get physically close, pokes fun at me, smiles when i laugh or approaches me and makes sure if im okay, or at least tries to be aware of how im doing by watching me from a distance. I did feel like he got jealous whenever i got close to other guys. It made me feel like he wanted to start over after he told me that during the months we drifted apart, he was going through a really bad phase with an unhealthy mindset, as was i. I‚Äôm just hurt now because all the things i wished i could do with him, he does with someone else, after he didnt make an effort to show up during the times we arranged to hang out with groups of friends. It makes me feel like what we had wasnt something special to him. Its like he has a double standard where he‚Äôs protective of me over other guys but is okay with hanging out with other girls til midnight. It hurts. It hurts to know that he‚Äôd willingly go out of his way to spend time with these people whereas the only time he‚Äôs made an effort to see me would be in projects. And then he‚Äôd focus on my reaction whenever another girl shows up.\n\nI‚Äôm tired of playing this game. I‚Äôm hurting and i dont know what to do. I didnt know i actually had feelings til i felt a bit of jealousy, although im sure he doesnt have feelings for her.\n\nI want him to have his own group of friends and give him his freedom but i guess i just feel this way because i feel betrayed. Why does he treat me so differently than all the other girls he interacts with..i dont really get it. And then when i drift away he comes to make sure i stay longer. That shit hurts.
5	Have you actually talked about being more than friends? \n\nI am nowhere close to an expert, but if I impose my limited experience onto the situation it goes something like this:\n\nI know there are people that I have had feelings for, that instead of just asking them out, I've tried to connect in the ways you describe your friend doing to sort of test the waters and see if there would be reciprocated feelings. \n\nThe thing about that though is I always felt like there was mixed signals, so if I were him, (instead of talking to you like a mature person), I could see myself withdrawing to see if you would do the reaching out but when you closed yourself off, he realized that your friendship wasn't worth risking continuing the withdrawal and apologized and (Apparently mistakenly) that you didn't feel anything besides friendship for him... \n\nThen you drifted for a while but I bet he still had feelings and just assumed you didn't feel the same for him, so my bet is that he tried to move on with other people (and maybe even avoided you because he feels like he can't get over his feelings for you but wants to give you space because he doesn't want to smother/impose himself on you).\n\n That said, if he's not going to say anything to you, he needs to just get over it and let go... but he's not good at that. As an ENFP, I don't show vulnerability well... and I rarely show it first. If you have feelings for him and want something more, I'd be open with him. \n\nIf you just want him in your life consistently as a friend, tell him that... but know that ENFPs are ridiculously optimistic and don't give up on the idea of good things, so if he has feelings for you, maintaining a friendship will require him to set boundaries for himself so he doesn't go over-the-top hoping to be more than friends... which might include occasional withdrawal. 
3	I went through something similar with a male infj friend of mine and me being the enfp. I also pulled him closer and then pushed him away, doing dumb things. At the time, I just wasn't sure if he was as invested in me as I was in him. I was also going through difficult times and wasn't sure if what I felt was even real. Also, the fact he didn't literally say what he thought of me made me doubt myself a lot. Looking back it was clear he was being genuine, I still don't know why I did all of that to him and I regretted it a lot afterwards. We're friends now and I still feel like I don't deserve his friendship because of how I confused, and probably hurt him. Have you made your intentions or feelings clear to him? I rarely really like someone but when I do, it scares me a lot and I can do things that seem to make no sense. I think it had to do with a lot of insecurities on my part. With guys I'm not that invested in, I flirt a lot more obvious and start dating them. I've dated some guys and if we broke up, I got over them within a week or so. But he's the only one with who the feelings lingered for a few years. \n\nWhen something feels real, it's very exciting but also frightening. I did basically the same things your enfp did. I just don't know what to think or do and just being irrational overall. I was pretty immature back then and now I wouldn't do such things anymore, but yeah. I think you should have a serious conversation about both your feelings and both your intentions so you can actually get somewhere and have some clarity.

2	Why is this ENFP totally me? (except the part where he had feelings for you, my experience was purely friendship). I did the same thing to my friend, except the reason why I closed myself off and pulled away was because I realised she was gossiping about me and I felt extremely betrayed. I wasn't only closed off to her, but to the rest of the world too. I needed that time to introspect and reflect on myself. We used to be best friends but we became quite hostile and awkward due to the animosity on my part. This year, I decided to forgive her when I realised she didn't intend to gossip about me, and started making amends by becoming the welcoming and enthusiastic friend I once was. Except I still haven't told her the reason why I was indifferent towards her during that period of time, because I don't like being vulnerable.\n\nWhat I would want this friend to do, is to take the initiative and to ask me why I was that way. I reckon that male ENFP of yours had a reason why he pushed you away, and a reason why he decided to keep you close again. We ENFPs don't like feeling like we're a burden to someone or feel like our feelings aren't reciprocated. Instead of voicing our feelings, we tend to shut ourselves and distance ourselves as a defense mechanism. And yet as sensitive as we are, we forgive the easiest. The best thing to do is to ask him, in a non-confrontational manner, and affirm him that you treasure him a lot too. 
2	ENFP Male Interviewing ENFP Male Jonathan Nott - NE-FI CS/P(B) MF	
2	Interesting I've only watched part of the video but he's an interesting ENFP, like an ENFP enneagram 6v5 or 5v6 or 5v4 which seems like an uncommon combo.  Thanks for sharing!
1	The future of humanity. Are we really heading for extinction?	Recently I was talking with some ENFPs friends and they all looked at me strangely when I said (in summary) that I believe in a better future, where we all come together and start worrying about the things that really matter instead of trying to kill each other for illogical reasons... What it striked me the most was that all of them were against my point of views because they were positive we're heading for extinction and that extincion is the better outcome, wich I find is a pessimistic way of thinking. So, I was curious about your opinions? what do you think is the future of humanity?\n\nBtw, I wasn't saying things randomly or ruled by positive feelings even when I have them. I was trying to brainstorm realistic and logical solutions to humanity and the world biggest problems (the most unattached of feelings, unattached of religion, unattached of everything and the most logical way of thinking possible), but I couldn't do it because they all attacked me saying it's impossible and barely let me expressed myself, which I found odd considering they're all ENFPs...\n\nA better future is really not possible? Are we heading for extinction? I know the sun eventually is going to die, global warming, wars, etc. But we really won't find solutions to this, or our efforts won't be enough? And if this is the way we're thinking now and extincion is the future we forsee, what is the meaning of our lives then? These questions are eating me alive lol, HELP!!
4	A better future is possible, but damn its unlikely. Theres so many threats to our future, some our own doing but many outside of our control. Hell, the vast majority of species to ever exist are long gone, it would be foolish to expect us to evade that fate forever.\n\nMy two cents, live life like the world is going to end but do it because you love existence. Live it in the moment. Live as an example of how you wish the future to be, others will follow. You cant force a change like that in others, you just show them the way
2	Yeah we're fucked. \n\nNo ones gonna unite when its the end. They'll fight over the last water source instead of share it and develop a new way together to get clean water. Especially with everyone getting dumber and dumber every day. 
2	Society will end, but humanity will live on in some shape or other.
2	I think millions if not billions will die. The future looks bleak. I think we will surmount it, but things will never be the same. But I do think we will persevere, create technologies to rise above our circumstances, learn to live within our means, etc, but no one's going to hand it to us. We're going to have to fight for it. And the truth is, some people will want to do the work, and some people would rather just die. Be positive. Not many people in the world are anymore and those are the types of people who will build our future, not the naysayers. They'd rather just give up. It's the easy way out, but it's not the only way out. 
2	Rather than Extinction, think it is as individual death. There's alot we can do to mitigate it, avoid it and delay it, but eventually even it it takes a billion years, humans (as we know them) won't be around. \n\nI think a better future is possible, and I think we will achieve it before some "Day after tomorrow" apocalypse. But alot of people will not live to see it. Just like the world today, things are pretty awesome when you think about it, but it was a hell of a rough road getting here. \n\nIn short there will and won't be a better future. Some will see it, others will not. If you want to see it, keep informed, alert and stay ahead of the pack. The more things change, the more they stay the same. War never changes, other metaphors yadda yaddaa... 
1	"Ignorance is bliss"	Just wondering what y'all think of this statement üôÇ\n\nEDIT: just for context, I decided to put this statement out there after watching this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xIFsLo8mgw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xIFsLo8mgw) featuring an ENFP who expresses this belief (at 12:26)
2	bliss for you, can be destructive to others. id say thats my main take on that.
2	I can't watch the video but I love this phrase. Use it in a sarcastic way tho, like when people decide to ignore worldwide problems because otherwise they feel bad actually could do something about it. 
204	Guys this is SO important for us to realize. It‚Äôs not always within your control how people treat you.	
33	My best advice for figuring out whether it‚Äôs within your control is looking at how they treat others. If they‚Äôre generally shitty to others, especially those who aren‚Äôt ‚Äúcool,‚Äù then they‚Äôre just shitty. Not worth your time. If they‚Äôre nice to a lot of people but not you, maybe you‚Äôre doing something wrong. Or maybe they just don‚Äôt like you. That‚Äôs ok too. You‚Äôre also allowed to just not like people :) 
13	Been aware of this for awhile. I always treat other how they treat me. I start out nice and hope it comes back the same. If not that's my time to shine as the @$$hole the cosmos intended me to be!
4	As a teacher, this has been the hardest thing emotionally for me to learn.
3	Need this so much.
3	You can only control what's inside your own hula-hoop.
3	I began treating people the way they treat me and it‚Äôs been a glorious lesson lmao 
2	Truth ! But it Doesn‚Äôt stop me from being me lol meaning for me I‚Äôm a pleaser and over the years I‚Äôve got caught up in ‚Äú hey I do a lot for you ‚Äú and why doesn‚Äôt her reciprocal output come even close to mine ‚Äú but alas , you live and learn and I‚Äôm in a much more equal relationship now and I don‚Äôt expect to much in return , it‚Äôs amazing what kind words and true appreciation can do to the psyche . And I‚Äôm me , and it brings me joy so yeah there‚Äôs that . 
-3	But my ENFP ex is slutty and that's why we couldn't be. He keeps wondering why he doesn't have a stable relationship. Well, maybe that's why
7	Curious...	Hi all! So I took the MBPT on April of 17, scoring as an ENFP-T, which at the time I found eerily accurate. I took this test again about 5 minutes ago and it changed to INFP-T, which is making me quite confused. Is this something that normally happens, just changing root types? Could i have become too different of a person without realizing it? Or, could I have the potential to flip between the two personality types based on current/recent life experiences and settings? 
13	It sounds that you took 16personalities test.\n\nTheir understanding of extrovert-introvert is slightly different from using cognitive functions.\nThey see it as standard "energized by people/energized by being by themself".\n\nCognitive functions see extroversion as more "interacting with components of external world" and introversion as "basing things on internal (subjective) world". In my opinion cognitive functions are more detailed and don't lock you in some silly dichotomy. \n\nINFP and ENFP have same combination of functions, but in different order. And that makes difference. \n \nWe have INFP, that goes through world by analysis based on their internal moral/emotional system, dominant Fi. I like/I don't like, it's good it's not good. ENFP have Fi as second function and they tend to be more open for things. \n\nNe is first for them, so we can say that analyzing idea of something, without automatically judging it is more common. Ne second in INFP people is used as a tool for them to TRY and be more open. \n\nSi tertiary vs last. INFP with immature Si tend to go on rants how some things were better once and overall they tend to be pretty nostalgic. ENFP's Si is more like ticking bomb that gets unleashed when ENFP is stressed out. Sudden hypochondria, sudden stiffness in case of plans, walking anxiety etc. \n\nThis is where we end up on Te. Tertiary in ENFP and last in INFP. ENFP uses it quite ok? I mean it's annoying when the most unorganized person ever suddenly remembers that some things need to be done and tell the others what to do. Te in INFP is... a way for them to blow up if something goes very wrong. Suddenly they get despotic, overly push on doing things their way and well, pretty angry. \n\nBoth of those behaviours can be seen in both INFP and ENFP (ENFP being despotic and INFP anxiety ridden) but the difference is what behavior happens first, is more common and how do functions interact with each other.\n\nShort: \n\nINFP - care deeply about own likes, dislikes and morals, but tries to be more open, often dwells on the past to know when they can be open and when not, tend to be overly despotic if things don't go their way\n\nENFP - curious and open about world, but anchors themself to things important to them so they won't lost them in constant novelty seeking, they need to organize themself to make sure THEY won't get lost in life, tend to get very anxiety ridden and stiff if things don't go their way\n\n
2	Infps are usually tidier, less messy, the unhealthy ones are on the depressive side, lack of self confidence. enfp is more chaotic and messy the unhealthy one is a ball of anxiety, hypochondriac,... Both tend to overanalyze things alot though.  I also tend to find infps more stubborn though. 
1	Nah, you can only be one. You just need to research it more and you'll figure out which one describes you better. Also note that ENFPs are renown as introverted extroverts (or at least that's what I've heard), so it can be easy to get mixed up 
1	Yeah it happens a lot, you being exposed to more different people as you grow up would impact the way you think and see things. It's all a part of personal growth you should be proud :) 
1	The 16 personalities test is bad, very bad, if you see a MBTI with the letter T or A behind it, know they took the 16 personalities test.\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ds9gzR6WoAA9GQu.jpg:orig\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow I am riffing on 16 personalities test for it is the worse but understand all the tests are bad to some degree for you get something like this.\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dxx9nWRUcAE_cAL.jpg:orig\n\nWhere ask the same type of question but in a slightly different way, a different point of view and you get a different result for humans are more complicated than these simple questions and answer test can generate.\n\nPut another way a test is the starting point, and after you take a couple different tests only then do you learn about the 8 functions, and how humans use all 8 of them but we have preferences for 4 of them that we "value" and we have "free energy" with 2 of them (and the other 2 we still value but we are less good at them and it is not free energy), and one of those 8 functions is our "leading."\n\nSo take this test.\n\nhttp://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp ^(Note there are other good tests.  Take the other good tests.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd after taking the other tests, then learn about the 8 things.\n\nhttp://www.cognitiveprocesses.com/Cognitive-Functions/\n\nhttps://lindaberens.com/resources/methodology-articles/cognitive-dynamics/
1	Hi there, psychologist here.\n\nI think the problem you encountered is something all typologies have in common - they are mutually exclusive (you can, by definition, only be part of one category). But aspects of your personality are in fact more situated on a scale - in this example from extraversion to introversion - than they are either/or categories.\n\nIf we assume that people score on that scale in a more or less normally distributed way, the average person will score somewhere in the middle between extraversion/introversion. With a typology though, scoring in the middle means that you‚Äòre right on the edge between ‚ÄûE‚Äú and ‚ÄûI‚Äú (and can easily score either of them when repeating the test because the difference may just be one or two points) when in reality, you‚Äòre just equally both. \n\nIf you want to be part of a category, just go with the one that fits you better - otherwise, just go with the knowledge that you‚Äòre equally introverted/extraverted. :)\n\n*(Oh and just to add that: The scientific definition of extraversion/introversion is in fact whether you gain or lose energy from social settings. And since the 16personalities test is based in theory on the so called ‚ÄûBig5‚Äú personality test, one of the most empirically validated and scientifically sound personality tests there is, it is actually the much better choice than any other MBTI test, even though it still poses the above mentioned problem all typologies do. The so called ‚ÄûJungian functions‚Äú those other tests are based on have no solid empirical base whatsoever and are therefore as reliable in predicting your personality as your daily horoscope. At least, from a psychological and scientific background. Just to give you another opinion. But in the end, you can of course do whatever floats your boat.)*
1	ENFP is the most introverted among the extroverts, sometimes our moods are very turbulent n shifted n  just need some time alone, dont really wanna deal with people (become introverted), its probably becoz u did the 2 tests at different states of mind
1	Tests are unreliable as you can see. You should study the cognitive functions and find which you lead and 2nd with.\n\nhttps://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/if-youre-confused-about-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-read-this-an-intro-to-cognitive-functions/\n\nhttps://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/12/how-each-cognitive-function-manifests-based-on-its-position-in-your-stacking/\n\nENFP function description: https://www.typeinmind.com/nefi/\n\nINFP: https://www.typeinmind.com/fine/
4	It makes me sad to think that, as an ENFP male, my appropriate intj/infj partner is unlikely to happen.	Just thought I'd share this. Looks like I better start loving myself because there's nobody out there for me apparently.
14	(INFP)\n\nHere's the thing:\n\nYes, socionics can help you find people you might be more drawn to but its not the end-all, be-all. The majority of my best friends are ISTPs. In theory, we should hate each other but they are the best people. I'm supposed to end up with an ENFJ, but my sister is an ENFJ and I can tell you right now its unlikely. She's a great person and we're very close, but I could never see myself in a romantic relationship with someone like her. We're just better as friends.\n\nI think the best way to make socionics work for you is by using it as a tool to help you understand yourself and other people better. You may find the INTJ/INFJ of your dreams some day, but you may also end up with an ESFJ or an ISFP and they could make you the happiest person in the world. Its all about personal growth through understanding better, not looking at the boxes and defining yourself either into or out of relationships.
12	Just because you are an ENFP does not mean the only partners that you can have a healthy relationship with are INTJs and INFJs. \n\nHonestly why limit yourself so much? Don't get together with someone based on a personality type. Get together with someone because you actually enjoy their company and you work well together. Types are not the end all be all. They may be types but no two people are the same. 
6	Dude, I'm ENFP married to an INTP, & funnily enough, my good friend (who is also my ex-fiancee) just learned about MBTI... & he's also INTP üòõ I guess I have a type lol, but it's not INTJ/INFJ üòõ & I didn't knowuch about this stuff when I met either of them. Just chill, meet some new people, & see who clicks. There's more to a person than just their type, after all! 
5	If you like someone or not, that makes them appropriate, not their type :p
3	Try being an INFP and having every asshat in the MBTI community telling you that you're never going to work with another ENFP, or even another NF, because apparently being profoundly similar and being able to intuitively engage each other on a deep psychological and emotional basis is a detriment now?\n\nI still spend time researching and exploring MBTI (maybe too much, lol) because I believe it serves as an effective shorthand for understanding people, but it isn't and it should never be the be all and end all. I used to go out of my way to make people I was interested in take the MBTI test, but I've stopped that now, because it's not a guarantor of anything.\n\ntl;dr MBTI is bullshit. There are far more important and tangible things to determine compatibility in a relationship.
3	If you use online dating apps, put "ENFP" in your profile. A lot of introvert types use these apps and maybe an INTJ or INFJ will spot it and instead of swiping "No" for whatever reason, they may be intrigued enough to swipe "Yes". Go from there. We can't always leave things to chance so try to improve your odds any way you can.
2	Start loving yourself because wtf not, right? It feels good, it can be super fucking hard, but it's probably THE most important, rewarding, powerful thing we can ever learn. Ever. \nAlso, while inj's are rare, it's definitely not impossible, and maybe not even all that difficult. \n I have drawn out fellow intuitives every where I roam. Parties, Facebook, school, work. You can literally go to a FB page, a Reddit group, and be like 'I live near X, and really want to meet one of you' and *probably* get a decent response. That's awesome! I mean, you wanna talk odds, think of people 200 years ago living on farms, in small towns...where it was like 'Sorry Milly, the pox got the rest of town, yur gonna have to bed your cuzin' Gilbert.' \nNah dude, these are the best times to live. Stay hopeful!
2	*winks*\n\nINTJs and INFJs are overrated, for example would an INTJ do this?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/EEBFnI0Mxrk?t=165
2	I would stop looking for those specific types and just look for another Intuitive type partner. A lot of ENFPs find that INTJs and/or INFJs are not an ideal match for them anyway. 
2	Trust me they‚Äôre not always the romanticized match you hear. I love my ENFJ partner.
1	INTJs and INFJ's are actually pretty different. I've seen them blow up as much as they work. They find us novelties at first but frankly I don't want to be a sideshow. And the idea of always having to pry any fun out seems exhausting and miserable. Don't base who you date on types.
1	I did not know this. Now I'm even more depressed. :(
1	I feel this so hard.
1	I've started to understand that when I say these things to myself, I can easily swing out of it and see the light.\n\nThe challenge is putting this way of thinking in the past tense.\n\nYou're an ENFP and we love exploring.  So explore the possibility.
5	My ENFP boyfriend is feeling depressed and I wanna know how to help:<	A brief profile of him is that he's normally very bubbly and cuddly. \nSo recently, he removed his profile picture on our messaging app and that's like...a sign. He removes it whenever he doesn't feel like ...anything. in his words, it's cause he wants to feel "zero".\n\nAnd then another instance, he removed his profile picture on Instagram. Which is on a more serious scale.\n\nI'm an ENTP. And if I told my other T friends, they'd seriously consider him being melodramatic. But I don't see it that way, I've known him for 3 years and I know why he does it, It really isn't a cry for attention. It's all just cause he feels uncomfortable with having a ''profile", idk if other ENFPs have felt this way.\n\nBut basically, when I asked him about it. He said that a lot of stuff has been happening (stuff from job commitments to family issues - this one's a biggie- ) and the thing is, he usually doesn't tell me much about the job stuff because he's always been just so tired from his job that when he talks to me, his brain is on 1% and I just try my best to just....cheer him up and entertain him. \n\nThen he asked if we can take a break. And I started BAWWWWWWLLING. But not infront of him, twas through the messaging app. But I asked why and that i don't think we need to because I wanna be there for him.\n\nHe explained that this whole stuff happening is something he needs to deal with alone. \nWhich I understand. So the terms of the break is that we just talk less. We are still tgt, I love him so so so much and he still loves me. He assured me it has nothing to do with the relationship. And it was just that there's so many bad things going on in his life at the moment.\n\nSo my question is. How do I help him feel better? It hurts to see him like this. I really want to make him happy. I just wanna know how I can help him through this difficult time, I really don't wanna he the one to weigh him down even more by being sad that he's upset. So i have been concealing it. 
8	If he‚Äôs asking for space, the best way to help is to give it to him.  I‚Äôm an ENFP and I had feeling smothered with concern and need time to sort stuff out alone.  When things are tough, I often withdraw. 
6	ENFP here. When things are tough, I also withdraw to try to sort things out: I usually withdraw from social media, barely respond to emails, texts or phone calls, socialize less... However, it's comforting to know that our love ones and close friends do notice these kinds of behaviours as odd and check on us. I would suggest letting him know that you're thinking of him and that you're available to talk/listen to him or just text if he needs it. A "thinking of you" or " I love you" or "I miss you" goes a long way. 
5	I think this is happening.\n\nhttp://weirdfella.tumblr.com/post/111830098579/in-the-grip-our-hidden-personality-by-naomi-l\n\nhttps://i.pinimg.com/originals/07/5d/e6/075de61a0ed00b13ddf0c60a9f5c2e12.png\n\nNote the 2nd link is for ENTP but it also applies to an ENFP.\n\nWhen an ENFP feels in the grip other stuff happen besides Ne and Si things.  They may reconsider their relationships they see as superficial (aka not you, but other relationships at work, false friends, etc.)  Things they feel like they are sucking their energy, where they are presenting a false face, a merry face, that does not feel real to them.  And they try to reattach to things that are real, and things that recharge them, but also things that help them actually achieve the goals they value and be more effective in the material world.\n\nNow lots of this is going to sound similar to an ENTP but it is slightly different for an ENFP uses their 2nd and 3rd function with Fi and Te instead of Ti and Fe and it is our 2nd and 3rd function where we interact with the world and we feel valued via the world.\n\nhttps://i.pinimg.com/736x/b9/1d/81/b91d81f3131820f9e471a7a3e59dc4d6.jpg\n\nIt is natural for an ENFP in this state to reconsider their relationships, and also to crave support of a person who does not try to solve their problems, or give them solutions, but instead just let them hear them out and they talk out nonsense but  talking out the nonsense is how an ENFP figures out solutions and ways to be effective, to be efficient, to achieve their goals with Tertiary Te.  It is also how they figure out which priorities matter most to them.  And they do this solitary or with people they can trust but will just be a sounding board and not try to steer them to one goal or another but instead just "talking."\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOf course all of what I said above may be wrong.  Or it may be right for other ENFPs but not your ENFP.  Furthermore I am not an ENFP so maybe my insights into them are not the best insights and you should consider the source and listen to the other people on this thread =)\n\nGood Luck \^_\^
3	When I'm retracting in my shell to sort things out I won't be like an infp, I appreciate that the people I care for, care for me, sending messages and etc, just won't expect much of communication but I will show them my gratitude for sure. I won't feel smothered at all. But it is individual specific. That is why now that I'm a bit older (32), I really appreciate my ENTP and also even ESFP friends. And I wish I was in a relationship with an ENTP :D because I find it the healthiest regarding communication. 
2	ENFP and agree with the withdrawal response. If I'm deep into self-analysis during this, I find it tough to talk about it until I've probed enough to figure out how to say what I'm feeling. Or where it comes from. Once I've discovered thate I'm driven to understand it more and I'll reach out or accept an invitation from a friend to share my thoughts. I most appreciate when people listen and try to understand while I do this because I can't muster the energy to assess possible solutions until I've thoroughly understood the problem. So listening is vital. I don't mind questions, because those help to further understand and it feels like working together on it. Once I've sufficiently examined the problem, I'm often VERY motivated to change what I can, but will also expect change to be immediate and can get burnt out on false hope and high expectations. As I've matured, I've recognized this tendency and rely on my more practical friends to help me troubleshoot these solutions. 
11	I‚Äôm feeling pretty hurt	I‚Äôm feeling pretty hurt.\n\nThis is probably going to be a really long post, but just felt the need to write something out. A venting of sorts to friendly strangers on the internet. So I mean if you have nothing better to do, be my guest lol\n\nI‚Äôm not sure if this detail helps anything but I‚Äôm an ENFP male and tonight before I was about to go to bed I found out that the INTJ girl I have so much love for, the girl that means so much to me, and essentially my favourite person is interested / in love with someone else, and it really hurts.\n\nIt‚Äôs my fault really - I guess I got a little too close.\n\nI should‚Äôve seen this coming, after all I‚Äôm just a housemate - and there‚Äôs nothing more to it. We only met and I guess we only really hung out because we lived together. If we didn‚Äôt, we probably wouldn‚Äôt be friends at all. I really hate to think of it like that but it‚Äôs true.\n\nThis is honestly one of those rare connections you cherish and feel the need to hold on really tight to. I‚Äôm so thankful that we did meet, and we did become close as we‚Äôve shared so many amazing experiences together and have many fond and hilarious memories. We just get along with each other so well, to the point where it feels effortless, As a very social person I usually feel exhausted after spending extended periods of time with anyone, but with her it‚Äôs different.\n\nIt just really hurts to think that none of that ever seemed to make much of an impact.\n\nI‚Äôm not saying that I‚Äôve just been head over heels for a girl who has given no signs of interest whatsoever - there have been periods where we have been really close, and it almost felt like something real? Something that could grow. Those moments die down and go cold whenever this guy comes back and decides to talk to her again. Makes me feel like a backup, temporary, disposable, and because I live with her I‚Äôm not exactly ‚Äògoing anywhere‚Äô. \n\nWow not an amazing feeling right? Haha yeah tell me more!\n\nI‚Äôve never heard her say a positive thing about this guy, it‚Äôs always been negative in some regard, I know they have a history ‚Äî this guy has declared his love for her on multiple occasions and she has always pushed back. She never mentions him around me, not even by name, she usually just references ‚Äòa friend of mine did this...‚Äô I have a friend who...‚Äô I don‚Äôt know why she feels the need to be so secretive and hide it from me, because I know who he is, I met him probably within the first month of me moving in. (This was well before when INTJ and I were close, and were just starting to get to know each other).\n\nI just don‚Äôt really get it hey - she‚Äôs so kind towards me, so loving, so thoughtful, kind, considerate, hilarious and knows me better than I know myself ‚Äî She goes out of her way to do favours for me to make my life easier and she speaks really highly of me and has said she really respects me to her friends (I only know this because a really good friend of hers told me) who does that? I‚Äôve only known her a little more than a year and she doesn‚Äôt do any of that for her ‚Äòbest friend‚Äô of over 10 years, (who also lives with us). Why the special treatment, over everyone else?\n\nI‚Äôve become so infatuated with this girl, and the it‚Äôs just the sheer amount of detail she‚Äôs gone in to get to know me, remembering every small, minor, like and dislike and stories I‚Äôve shared. I‚Äôve never really ever let anyone ‚Äòin‚Äô as I‚Äôve always been afraid of this very situation happening hahah damn it, look what happened.\n\nI‚Äôm always appearing as the happy-go-lucky, up beat, cheerful guy to basically everyone. She was able to see right through it pretty much within a few moments with her and saw the side of me no one sees. (How dramatic) I guess that‚Äôs what got me so interested and hooked in the first place. The feeling of being understood. She understands me, I understand her - there‚Äôs this silent energy / feeling ‚Äî It‚Äôs just through this really deep eye contact and we‚Äôre able to understand how one another is feeling, without any words being spoken - I‚Äôve never experienced that with anyone else before and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm feeling hurt, because it feels so real.\n\nI feel so trapped in this house. I feel like her ‚Äòbest friend‚Äô that we live with let‚Äôs call her INFJ really gets between everything and INTJ changes so much around her compared to when it‚Äôs just us, it always kind of saddens me. INFJ has always been incredibly envious / jealous / insecure about how well both INTJ and I get along. Both I and INTJ have to adapt to INFJ to keep them happy and feeling secure and in control.\n\nI can‚Äôt help but feel as though over time INFJ has said negative things about me, painting a poor opinion of me to INTJ. Kind of like ‚Äòhere‚Äôs my opinion of ENFP, and it should be yours too‚Äô. Although I‚Äôd like to think that INTJ isn‚Äôt that impressionable.\n\nWhat can I even do in this situation. I‚Äôm not in a position to distance myself or leave, I really wish I didn‚Äôt care as much as I do - it‚Äôs just so hard to ignore these feelings I have for her. I just feel so exhausted by all of this.\n\nMaybe it‚Äôs my fault, maybe I‚Äôve been playing it too cool and haven‚Äôt been proactive enough in showing my interest. Maybe I‚Äôve missed opportunities I never saw were there. I just didn‚Äôt want to overstep or make too big of a risk in case the feelings weren‚Äôt mutual and I‚Äôm afraid to ruin the house dynamic. But at the same time I don‚Äôt care if I do, because it feels real and worth chasing.\n\nANYWAY, just as well it‚Äôs my problem to sort out and not yours am I right? Because that could be stressful!\n\nIf you ended up reading all of this, I hope you enjoyed yourself haha - I really appreciate you and hope you‚Äôre having a great day!
3	How are you so sure she likes him? Did she say it outright? I‚Äôm asking this because when I‚Äôve been over-thinking I might think someone liked someone, when they didn‚Äôt. It does sound like she likes you.
2	Hugs, I feel you, you never expressed your interest for her no? Why wouldn't you do it directly? I understand in a flatshare it would become dramatic but how are you so sure that she likes the other guy?
2	Have you talked to the INFJ? There's a possibility that they are being passive aggressive for something that you don't know about.\n\nAs for the INTJ I'd be straight forward or drop hints. But I'm sure there's more going on so that may not be an option.
2	From what i understand about XNTJs is they focus on one thing at a time and are willing to exhaust all options to see something they care about to its end. Even though she appears to be fond of you and may even see you as a potential mate the fact is she still has unfinished business with a current romantic relationship. My advice is to respect this boundary between her and this other man and just continue being you. It is not true you havent made an impact in her life and its not false either, so save those assumption for when that information is confirmed. Otherwise its use is to only stir your feelings further. Use the accumulated energy from the feeling recieved to express yourself, it helps brings clarity and potentially bring into fruition a finished product/gesture that represents your feelings exactly. 
2	I know that connection you're talking about, and when you're in it, it feels like that's all that matters. From what it sounds like, you have been going back and forth in your head, overthinking and overanalyzing this (been there, 100%) but I've found that usually when I'm overthinking something, I'm trying to control a situation instead of confronting my feelings and doing what my gut says. It sounds like, from what you're saying here, that the more you think about it, the more positive you are of how much this girl means to you. At the end of the day, her friend INFJ, and the boy that's pursuing her that she's not that into, they are not relevant to your relationship with her. They have no say in it. I always find myself thinking&worrying about things that actually don't matter when I'm afraid to take action about something (not that this is necessarily your case!) At this point, maybe you just tell her how you feel, if that's what feels right.
1	It really sucks.. hope things will turn out good so you can soon be happy again! Keep your head up!
1	I'd agree it sounds like you're playing it cool.  Cut that out.  That's not you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're an ENFP.  If you really want something, nothing can stop you.  I'd look at what's in the way of you not having those conversations you're really dying to have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen have them.  And don't quit until you get what you want - or discover it's not what you really wanted anyways.  When you stop playing it cool and start being authentic, they'll reflect your boldness and things will clear up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPart of our dominant function is exploration, you'll have to explore it to get to the bottom of things.
172	This resonates with me for sure.	
27	lol this is the exact opposite of me.\n\n\-rarely go all in, unless its something that truly engages me.\n\n\-almost never keep my word, I am extremely unreliable. \n\n\-might go the extra mile for someone I care about, depends.\n\n\-I am pretty selfless tho.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts probably because of my ADHD. 
7	I want to find someone who is as passionate about me as I am for them...I sort of have, but they live all the way on the other side of the planet so...
6	I can relate, but the 'finding someone' part is where I lag behind. üòî
3	Find yourself an INTJ friend, allow them their space when they need it, relish in silence with them and you'll have a friend for life. ENFP-INTJ relationships are the bomb.
3	Why constrict our love in one direction ?
2	As an INTJ, that's what I love about ENFPs; the ones that give their all, their passion and their word. I place those people in my inner circle, and trust them to get the job done. A toast to the ones that *do*!
2	Thank you. I really needed to hear this. 
2	Got to say this one thing about not receiving it in return, \n\nI feel like it‚Äôs because we‚Äôre afraid of asking. YES some of us probably do things for others without them ever having to ask, because we sense what they need. But others might not sense these things. \n\nMy biggest breakthrough these past months has been to ask for help and people actually coming through! \n\n‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
4	This is exactly me and I love being like this ‚ù§Ô∏è\nI‚Äôm happy to have found someone who is also passionate about me luckily
2	r/humblebrag
1	This is me! I‚Äôm happy to have found my INFJ man :)
8	Does anyone else have a sore throat all the time from talking too much??	
1	So true!
1	Nah, if I talk too much my mouth gets dry
1	Or from laughing too much 
3	How ENFPs Can Access Hyper Focus	
5	It's concerning the way he talks about "getting the girl". Even if you're the best version of yourself, there are men and women who won't be attracted to you and that's okay. You don't just deserve the person you want because you like them. I don't get this mindset?
3	I think one of ENFP's strongest traits to develop is accepting rejection and letting go.  Sales really helped with that I'm sure?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm very familiar with procrastinating and 'creating a crisis' to get things done at the last moment.  There may be truth in creating a crisis earlier, I'd like to think we can do it without having to get emotional.  That's true discipline.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a writing project I'm currently procrastinating on now, it really doesn't work.  Thanks for this video it helps!!
2	What‚Äôs going on with this ENFP friend? Avoidance/bullying?	So my friend/colleague ENFP (he‚Äôs male, I‚Äôm female, both 26) and I texted everyday for the past 3 years.\n\nBut since past week this happened...\n\n- His texting frequency got much lower.\n- He doesn‚Äôt rant about work stuff anymore.\n- He makes comments towards me in group chats that I wouldn‚Äôt consider very nice.\n- He almost ignores me fully in person.\n- I wasn‚Äôt in the best place past week because of this and he never asked if I‚Äôm okay. \n- He posted numerous fun pictures with other colleagues at parties, that I skipped because all of the above, in group chat.\n- I asked him if I said or did something he would tell me and he said: stop it.\n- He does text me some pictures of cool stuff but that‚Äôs it.\n- No more memes, jokes, gossiping through text.\n- Other colleagues even notice the tension.\n\n\nWhat‚Äôs going on here??
3	If it was just ignoring I would have said that he has found sth interesting and is busy with that or is worried about sth that he needs to decide about. But with the mean comments, he might have become very hurt from sth you did, if that is the case he would speak up about it. Could I ask what is your type? Won't u misinterpret the comments? Also many things are really not mbti related. They are just personal traits, morals and ethics.
3	I had something similar go on with an ENFP after a big fight (so there was an obvious reason). But there was no reason for him to act like the asshole he was being at that time. He's also been a dick before when he was down or had a lot on his mind, being stressed. I'm ENFP myself so at some point I just got angry and so annoyed by it that I literally said something like "Okay dude, the fact you called me dumb and ignore all my texts is pretty damn hurtful. I don't know what's going on with you but that's no excuse to treat a friend you care about this way. Tell me what the hell is going on because I will not put up with your shit any longer if this keeps up. It makes me very upset and feel shitty about myself so just talk to me." I should add I've known him for 3 years and we always had this sarcastic/roasting kind of friendship so I'm used to talk shit to him (for jokes). You're in a different situation but often when an ENFP is acting annoying or ignoring you in some way, the best thing to do is be BRUTALLY honest. Show and put words to your frustrated and hurt feelings, tell him exactly what actions of him are hurting you and what impact it has on you. That friend of mine is a big alpha guy, but he has a heart of gold. So when he's being a total dick, I know something is wrong and he'll never talk about it but instead treat his friends not like he's supposed to because he's so focused on whatever is bothering him. This causes him to be less empathetic. You gotta shock him back into his empathetic mode by telling him how much he is hurting you. Don't be shy with your words. ENFP's value honesty, so even if he'd respond aggressive or defensive at first, he'll eventually realise what he's been doing to you and that you deserve an explanation. I've showed similar behavior too before and my closest friends eventually got sick of it and just straight up told me the shit I did that was causing trouble and hurt feelings. I didn't even realise I was being like that until they told me very brutally. Might help in your case too. Don't be afraid to mention that you felt shitty the past week and he didn't even notice or ask about it. Don't avoid hard topics, tell him exactly what hurt you in what way. But don't put it all on him, don't say he as a person hurts you because in the end you are friends and you care about him and he isn't all bad. Maybe even tell him what actions he did in the past you apreciated in him as a person, the good things, and that you miss that. Focus more on certain actions or words he used. This will probably avoid too much defensive actions from his side.
2	Have you tried being direct and honest.  \nIs there something wrong?  \nAre you mad at me?  \nAre you okay dude, you've been acting weird lately?
326	(xpost) tbf could also be butterfly bestie	
36	Literally me. Not even a joke
20	We ENFPs can't have enough friends
22	I really don't get this about ENFP's. I'm enfp myself but never, not once, have I ever wanted to be friends with random people I barely knew. It's not genuine and often people turn out to annoy me in some way. 
15	Anytime i am left at a mcdonalds by myself, I make a new friend, I didn‚Äôt even start the conversation. My friend has witnessed this multiple times in multiples cities, she cannot believe that random people come up to me and start a conversation. ENFP problems. Amirite?
6	LOL YES. I haven‚Äôt had a best friend (except for one long distance) for 7 years. I‚Äôm just now realizing that I‚Äôve got to stop wondering if everyone I meet will be my bff. 
7	i'm feeling very attacked by this relatable content
5	Me with my Uber drivers after a 10 minute chat lol\n\nMy driver today was like ‚ÄúWe are all energy. Remember that. When you go to sleep at night, really think about what you want and who you want to be, and you will attract it subconsciously.‚Äù
6	I chat with people but I don't consider them a close friend or wonder if they're my new best friend... How could they be, I hardly know them?\nNothing can compare to all the time spent together with long term friends.
4	I AM EXPOSED
7	And then you find out more about them...you idealize them...then you become disillusioned. Then you are like people are people and come to appreciate them where they are in life.
3	Is this why I‚Äôve been engaged 6 times? üòÇ
2	Why is this post so loud üòÇü§£
2	Me asf
2	damn this is spot on 
2	So I'm your new best friend? What do best friends do?
2	it hurts how much i relate
2	It's so true.  It's actually a problem for me, I pretty much befriend everyone in any store I go into.  Then it becomes awkward when you're in a bad mood or looking gross and you just want to run into your local grocery and grab some wine and chocolate and leave.  But you have to have conversations because you know everyone and they're all excited to see you 
2	This is exactly my life.  Stahp.
2	Bonus for pretty strangers
2	today i have arranged to go out with a friend i never meet like a week ago and i couldn't cancel cause i always cancel. been going out with random friends i never go out with for all summer. in my country, today was 40 degrees celsius (104 farenheit).\n\ni've been wondering why the hell do i have to have so many friends lol\n\n~~don't regret it tho~~
25	Found this meme on this sub. Sent to a group chat with me (ENFP), my girlfriend (ESFJ), and a good friend of mine (ENFP.) This is the conversation that followed.	
7	I made that meme. It makes me so happy to know you guys liked it! ü¶ã
2	A guy on Twitter follow each other because we struck up a friendship on a flight last year.  
71	The voice in my head when I get a crush on someone:	
1	Perfection 
1	Haha I've experienced this as an ENFP.\n\nI find the healthiest thing to do is let my whole love hang out.\n\nIf they reject me.  No problem.  They weren't for me/mentally healthy enough for me.\n\nIt was a painful road getting to that level of confidence.  But it was worth it.
2	A sense of wonder. Contemplation on Infinity, Eclecticism and Self-realization.	This is a short animation of a casual conversation between two friends where both get a moment of rapture. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4Dd55N\_mg0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4Dd55N_mg0)
2	What are your thoughts on ISTJs? Even though we have the same cognitive functions how are we so different?	Is any ENFP on here dating an ISTJ? I have always admired ISTJs and have been attracted to them. They‚Äôre really cool and have a level-headedness that I don‚Äôt most of the time. I love being an enfp but sometimes I wish I could channel their cool cucumber vibe and be more like them! :)
3	The shared middle functions of Te and Fi help our relationshps with them massively. The double edged sword is that they have Ne as their last function and we have Si as our last function. We are perciebing the same things, it is just that one does the job better than the other in certain situations, and that can potentially lead to conflict which isn't as likely with a type like an INTJ or INFJ for this kind of situation. \n\nWith that said, I think ISTJs and ENFPs often get along quite well.
2	Functions are the same, they are just in different order, so it's not this bad. It's easy to understand their point of view, since the same things may be important to you, just way less than to them.\n\nI'm in relationship with ISTJ and the stuff is so fun. If done well, they can help each other with lower functions. ENFP can learn to be more organized and self aware (in terms of body) and ISTJ can learn to be more relaxed and self aware (in emotional sense).\n
1	Married to one. It‚Äôs great except they aren‚Äôt really fun to let your mind run with. Very practical. One of the best things is I have great ideas but then don‚Äôt do them. They make your crazy ideas happen. \nAlso they organize your budget, calendar, life. 
4	Why ENFPs Will Kick INTJ and INFJs Asses In A 20-40 Year Time Span (Ne VS Ni)	
3	Yes, but make sure you stick to rotating within those four areas, otherwise (if you keep adding) you‚Äôll still wind up as a master of none.
4	Accomplished something today.. depressed instead of happy	 \n\nSo  today I accomplished something that's really important to me and that's  been a huge goal of mine for years. It's something that I'd constantly  question if it was possible for me to ever do. Well a few hours ago, I  was finally able to make my dream a reality. And instead of being happy,  I'm feeling super depressed. I'm not really sure why either. I guess I  keep thinking about all of the other goals that are still unaccomplished  and how my life is still far from where I want it to be.\n\n  \n\nI don't understand why I can't just be happy for my accomplishment, instead I'm on the verge of tears as I write this.
6	I think you should take this as a sign that\nA. You Expect WAY too much of yourself and B. You convince yourself that if you could just accomplish this one thing, no matter what it is, you would be happy. So inevitably you‚Äôll feel depressed because nothing you ever do will be good enough for you, as long as you continue to follow this toxic thought pattern. \n\nI say this as someone that struggles with the exact same thing. (It‚Äôs always easier to give advice than to apply it to yourself lol) All my love to you. You‚Äôll get through this. 
1	You probably feel you don't deserve it.\n\nYou do deserve it.  And you deserve that future you're building even if you're not there yet.\n\nHave gratitude for your accomplishments and acknowledge how awesome you are.\n\nGet a couple of your friends together and celebrate yourself!
12	Do you ever feel so undefined that you're almost not a real person?	I feel like even though the way I respond to people is usually predictable, the range of responses and reactions I have vary so much that I'm not a defined person.  It makes me question myself and my own validity a lot.  I dont know if this is more of a depersonalization issue or something that ENFPs go through a lot
7	I sorta resonate with this, I haven't thought about it much though. I strive for my interactions and experiences to be both authentic and unique. Canned answers don't jive with me. My response to something today may be different than my response next week, because I'm a person who is constantly changing, growing, and experimenting. Whatever my response is, its true to me at that time, and anyone's expectation of how I should act is their own problem. \n\nBut maybe I don't fully understand the issue, can you provide some examples?
2	I experience myself quite similarly, as very dynamic, multi-faceted, growing/changing, in constant flux, varying a great deal in response/reactions etc. even though, as you mention, there are certain things about me and my habits and way of living that are consistent... I guess I'd argue I'm consistently inconsistent, dammit! lol. There are patterns to observe, but it kind of requires stepping much farther out, but also recognizing them express in very different ways than they do with most people. Like,  emotional vibrations, thought-processes, contemplations, motivations, values, etc. Are you an enneagram 4 by chance? I am. And, 4's search for identity actually becomes one of the most defining factors *of* the identity. However, I haven't actually come to the 'not a real person' meaning, though, I can easily see how someone might. And I'm going to assume (apologize if I'm wrong) that you are not really comfortable with that, that you find such fluidity difficult (which it is) and perhaps even, shameful/embarrassing (it should not be). \n\nTo connect this back to mbti, ENFP's have inferior Si, which can easily disrupt ones identity-continuum, imo. First, the Ne user's attention is not directed towards the sensory data which provides a more concrete/grounded physical interpretation of reality and linear movement through time, but conceptual exploration of possibilities/what could be's in leaps and bounds. So Ne is turned away from 'what is' (unlike Se users) and 'what was' (Si users). Even when the Ne user does look back, they may find strings of Si data lacing together a diverse patchwork of conceptual fabrics, creating a quilt Fi just wants to wrap itself in, and the more traditional understanding of 'self' is likely greatly informed by Fi, for ENFP. Of course, Fi is also incredibly abstract, subjective, and impressionistic. Or atleast that's my shpin on it. \n\nIf you are worried you are alone, you are not. If you are worried it means something (waves fingers around wildly) very *terrible* about you, it does not. In fact, I've made the argument countless times, that having a more flexible, dynamic, fluctuating sense of self holds significant advantages in terms of liberation, receptiveness to change/growth, exploration, truly understanding and appreciating diversity both in ourselves and others. We didnt come up in this joint to sit here like a bump on a fucking log, confined to superficial categories and stagnating conditions. We came in to move and shake and expand. A fluid sense of self only becomes problematic if you make it so, if you attach harsh moral judgements to it which erode your self-love. Accept it, and without apology. It takes a 'real' person to challenge any costructs and identifications that confine them. \n\n\n\n\n
2	I absolutely relate. I struggled so hard in my 20‚Äôs with it. A big relationship suffered from it, cause I was a different person with my friends and with my SO of the time. \nEven with my friends, I didn‚Äôt know how to really adapt to them, I just filled the role they would let me have somehow, to the point of believing that I didn‚Äôt have any real personality, I was this caricature of a ‚Äúcute‚Äùand ‚Äúnice‚Äù guy. \nAnd then after years and years I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. It was so exhausting to conform that I had a breakdown and I ditched almost all of my friends, I just kept the ones I considered family, people who really know me. \nHad a new job, made new friends and now I can say I embrace how I‚Äôm changing depending on the person I‚Äôm taking to. Which is also different if I‚Äôm talking to 2, 3 and more person at the time. I just accepted that I was good at sensing people, and that they bring out different parts of me, and that my adaptation to them was just my way of connecting with them. As long as you stay sincere, the way you behave is just a tool. My job and activities are centered on connecting with people in a way or another and I can tell you I‚Äôm happy to be this adaptable. \n\nTl;dr : embrace it; have fun with it and eventually it‚Äôll help you define yourself better. 
2	I had this phase.  It was long and it was painful to be in.\n\nThe reason you don't feel real is because you don't think you can be accepted no matter what way you are.\n\nAnd you'll be present that you're only "this way and that way" during interactions in order to be accepted.  And you'll even doubt whether or not you're excepted even though you tried hard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBelieve it or not, this is the start of your access to your superpowers.  It means you are acutely aware of what people want.  Which is acceptance and understanding.  The more you continue developing that the more real and grounded you will become.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy suggestion is get with a community outside your normal communities, get involved, explore, take risks.  You're built for that kind of thing and most likely your current community doesn't know the real you - so you have to find places and people who will bring you out.  Your journey is just beginning.
3	What helps you figure out/hone in on your interests?	I seriously need help. I (26F) feel so lost most days. My mind is like an endless thought pattern of what I "should" be doing instead as far as career.\n\nA little backstory: In college I started to question what I was studying halfway through my major because I realized it was not as fast paced/hands-on as I wanted. Then I met my boyfriend and then sort of put all those thoughts on the backburner, and here I am 5 years later wondering what I am doing.\n\nI have a stable job that makes \*enough\* but with little room for growth. It can also be unfulfilling sometimes, especially when I spend like 80% of my time in deep thought about what I should or could be doing instead.\n\nI cannot, for the life of me, figure out what my true interests are. And this is when I realized I was an ENFP. Some days I am so sure I am a people-person, the next I wish I had a job where I just work with my hands all day and don't talk to anyone. Some days I am sure I care a lot about numbers and business, the next I want nothing to do with that and want to work directly with people/ideas.\n\nI have no idea what I am good at. I never really had a mentor in my field nor did I have many "career" people in my life to look up to when I was growing up. My parents just sort of pushed college on me as a first-generation American but never helped me develop my skills. Even now when I ask them out of desperation what I was good at as a kid, they say they can't remember or just that I used to talk a lot. They did say that what I do now is the last thing they would have ever expected of me.  \n\n\nHow have you been able to really solidify your interests or at least let go of the idea that you need to be doing everything?
3	you have to fully commit to all the different things you‚Äôre into and dedicate the time to reach expertise in each of them, at the expense of mindless socializing and people pleasing. Ne is about the long game. It takes more time to reap the benefits but you also get faster at learning new things. I have many hobbies and I am good at all of them, basically because I rotated through different interests consistently over the years and built skill in vastly different areas. It‚Äôs slow at first but having expert knowledge in multiple fields creates a snowball effect and you just end up knowing about a ton of things because you create a ton of connections any time you learn anything new.\n\nNe is beastly if you can hack your curiosity. It‚Äôs the renaissance man/woman function. You have to let yourself roam to develop interests. 
2	Maybe you're overthinking too much about what to do, rather than doing something in practice. Except your daily job, that works as daily routine and to some extent _distracts_ your mind.\n\nI was there, but then I learned to not take it as a concern, and started _doing_ things:\n\n* not happy with my job? -> find an alternative and do the switch -> I changed more than a dozen jobs/workplaces in the last 15 years\n* want to learn something? -> learn that thing -> maybe eventually get bored and look elsewhere -> I changed tens of hobbies for that reason\n\nLife is never a straight path, things change for better AND worse anyway continuously. You just need to go through these changes in a way or another. Sometimes it will hurt, other times you'll live your best moments in life.\n\nMaybe you can be good at everything, providing enough effort and passion. If there's something that makes you passionate today, then put effort on it and fix a goal to challenge yourself in achieving it. If you change your mind, again do the same thing.\n\ngood luck.
10	Not quite sure if this is an ENFP thing	Whenever I drink coffee and am in class I want to interact and be friends with all of my classmates. I become so extroverted after drinking coffee, it's ridiculous
5	Haha I also get high on coffee 
3	You're gonna love methamphetamines
2	when i have meetings in the morning, i drink extra coffee so i‚Äôll be more outgoing at meeting time. üò¨‚òïÔ∏è
238	Me	
22	My ENFP girlfriend is so much like this.
25	They even have the "no memes" rule!!! I ONLY WANT TO LOVE YOU GUYS OKAY??? LET ME LOVE YOU
10	I‚Äôm an ENFP male. My fianc√© is an INTJ. Can‚Äôt wait to see her reaction to this.
7	This is spot on. I'm always afraid of it making me look desperate, clingy and annoying though 
6	this, but with literally everyone ever
3	we like it \nbut it destroys our productivity 
3	I think this goes the other way round too.
9	Is being an ENFP the same thing has having autism? lol
1	This always confuses me...the only INTJ I know is overly clingy and constantly talks about emotions and people.on a base level he's more interested in concepts but he's super clingy towards me...idk if he just changes for me tho? The rest of the people I know are a bit more hard pressed to let me in, altho I never really had problems w anyone letting me in, even tho most people think I'm weird. This post confuses me ü•¥
1	Wait... my boyfriend is INTJ. 
1	Why do so many ENFP's like INTJs? :o
7	How to change being introverted around extroverts?	So i am really extroverted but once I am around "more" extroverted people i become the quiet one kind of, like the more introverted one. sometimes a bit shy (!!!) even. why is this and how could I KICK OUT OF MY BRAIN?
7	I mean when I see someone trying to be louder and more energetic than me I just let them go for it.... I notice all the weird shit people say and do when they are trying to be the center of attention.... And it kinda helps me not to make those same mistakes
6	What's wrong with that? We're the most introverted extraverts for a reason.
3	if you try and change to match the other extroverts, you're going to end up drained/burned out
1	Easy. Be extroverted around them
3	I got some awesome responses when I last posted a video... here is a funny thing I (INFP) made with my friend (ENFP), hope you like it! :)	
36	I wish I could tell everyone I love them so much and think they are gorgeous.	I still do anyway no matter how much they think i‚Äôm tryna hit on them. 
11	Instead, I try and send out the vibe to all humans that they are worthy of genuine interest and attention. Sometimes by having conversation when I can! 
6	I wouldn't go this far at all, but - I can relate to the principle. There are often times I'd like to be more verbally affirming, affectionate or encouraging but cant, because doing so would clearly sound like something other than it is. As much as I want people to feel encouraged and loved, I dont want them to feel awkward. 
2	(INFP) Awwwwwww
1	Even when I cry?
5	The Egg (a short story about the afterlife you might enjoy)	
2	Woooowwwww that's some of the best writing I've read
1	Excellent\n\n~*Edit*~ Have you ever read Cloud Atlas or The Incarnations?
1	Really beautiful. Thx
7	Shoutout to all you ENFPs with migraine	Does your friend circle know about it? How do you handle people in your "bad days"?
4	I usually need a silent hug and someone cleaning my super messy place, but I end up not telling anyone cause I don't want to sound to dramatic and needy. 
4	my closest circle knows. they know to check in on me without nagging me when i‚Äôm down for the count. \n\nusually i don‚Äôt let people at work know until they realize what a diligent worker i am and understand my value. once i do tell my bosses, they‚Äôre always super understanding about my need to work at home or take a day off. i‚Äôve been very lucky in that regard. \n\nthankfully i‚Äôve got a pretty good regimen of meds. amitriptyline is my daily preventative. if i feel one coming on, i‚Äôve got maxalt (rizatriptan), ketorolac (torodol) and fioricet. if it‚Äôs ‚Äúkill it with fire‚Äù level, i use benadryl and/or cyclobenzaprine to just knock myself out.  my pain level hasn‚Äôt been above a 6 since i started the amitriptyline, which i consider a win. \n\ni‚Äôve been dealing with them for 20 years now, so they‚Äôve definitely impacted the way i make my decisions and interact with people. 
2	Where do I find you ENFP's?	Obviously there is not a single answer, but in general. I am a 28 y/o INTJ male and just got out of a couple long term relationships that have eaten up my 20's. I would dieee to have an ENFP friend who would consider the things that I say. Just someone to converse with that is willing to at least consider different perspective on topics and ideas.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy issue is that I shed most of my friendships during my last relationship. I am now left pretty alone. My attempt at connecting with people via social media was not successful. I just dropped that entire idea all together. I really want to find someone that will at least attempt to understand me. Somebody that I could share knowledge with (knowledge is a passion :|). So where are you? Where do you like to go. How do I spot you? What would be an optimal introduction when I do. What does valuable one on one time look like to you?
4	>So where are you?\n\nI work and spend time with friends while pursuing my hobbies which range from DJing to darts to video games, and more. Anywhere where people indulge in hobbies you will find ENFPs, particularly people who are just starting out in whatever the hobby is. \n\n>Where do you like to go\n\nRaves, concerts, festivals, bars\n\n>How do I spot you? \n\nOur eyes will wander when in conversation. We let more outgoing types dominate conversations but will take a stronger role if we are surrounded by introverts. Idk how to really answer this one. \n\n>What would be an optimal introduction when I do\n\nA compliment is a great way to get an ENFP to notice you, or at least me. In conversations i am so focused on others rather than myself that it feels nice to be noticed for the choices I made in how I present myself. Whether thats hair or beard or clothes. Most of my choices aren't accidents, and if someone notices the subtle ways I express my individuality then it makes me interested in getting to know that person. However, it doesn't mean an immediate conversation will happen. Often I will be caught off guard if someone approaches me whom I don't know, so if the ENFP has social anxiety they will need some space to sortof open themselves up. They will talk to you though if they want to, you can't force it. \n\n>What does valuable one on one time look like to you?\n\nGetting high and watching stuff on tv/youtube with a close friend, and having deep conversations about what the concepts and ideas presented in the show, what they mean to us, what they mean to society, what they represent, etc.  Really just abstract discussion about anything. 
3	Well, I don‚Äôt know what part of the world you‚Äôre in. If you live in a city or not? \nI live in a city in Sweden, with close proximity to bars and things like that. Being very social (surprise lol) I enjoy going to bars, hanging out with my friends and things like that! :) \nIf I‚Äôm out having a cigarette (no hate, I know it‚Äôs a bad habit) I‚Äôll talk to pretty much anyone hehe. Not saying you should start, but it‚Äôs just an example of a situation where I‚Äôm open to chat with strangers. 
1	I'm not so sure. I think each ENFP is a bit different in some ways. I'm pretty reserved anymore, as I have lost a lot of friendships so I am hesitant to just "Go out." But hey, you found this subreddit. That's a start, isn't it? 
1	>I would dieee to have an ENFP friend who would consider the things that I say. \n\noh boy, it is so hard for intuitives, especially N-doms, to find people like us. I feel this so much :,( I found a friend last year that would talk with me about all that type of abstract stuff (pretty sure he was an N-dom) and I was insanely ecstatic. I have never experienced that type of connection before; being able to connect with someone based off of ideas and stuff that I literally think about all the type, its something different man. things got weird/distant with that guy though and now we don't talk anymore, which makes me so fucking sad I can't handle it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nanyways, apparently you can spot an Ne dom because we have "flitting eyes and erratic expressions." For me, I think I kind of bounce when I walk and will stop here and there to look at things I find interesting. As for where you can find us, I'd say anywhere from a hike in the mountains to a book club. Just follow your interests, especially if they are focused on some kind of exploration (physical or mental) and I'm sure you'll find a few of us! we love excitement and discovery! I find I'm usually very open to new people who want to talk to me, and I think in general if you approach an ENFP, they will want to talk to you. we love people. mention something we might find interesting, an idea or theory on something, or something cool you did, but nothing too heavy right away I'd say. Ask our opinion on something interesting, I would die if someone asked me what I thought of Elon Musk or religion. Valuable one on one time looks like interesting conversations about some new theory that you or I thought of. I believe listening is very important to ENFPs, if you take our ideas seriously and run with them, we will be addicted to you. humor us!!
1	Try personal coaching programs, self help, Tony Robbins events, etc..  People in need of break throughs are bees to honey for ENFP.
200	All the crossovers	
24	(INFP) I'm convinced you're all just INFPs without as much anxiety and self-censorship/loathing. 
4	Y'all know how it is, you have this annoying sensor going off whenever you do so much as breathe. WHY AM I LIKE THIS, a 378 part essay by me
3	Me
2	My feelings are so repressed when I'm social that I feel like an ENTP, but when I'm on my own its the only time I get to breathe
2	Mwuahahahaha ALL. THE. TIME. 
2	I dont think I'm annoying. 
2	Oh I relate to this.. and I wish I didn't. My INTJ says I'm more or less like a golden retriever, and I can't tell if that is good or bad at times.
1	Is this a crossover episode?!?!?!
10	I am realizing that communication is very important to me....	I am in a relationship with an ENTJ (m) who sometimes leaves me on read... I know he is an incredibly busy person but it makes me feel like garbage. :/ \n\nI feel needy and insecure. I let my guard down for him and now I feel extremely vulnerable. Never did this for anyone else. \n\nAnyways, I highly value words of affirmation and constant communication. I don't know how to state this without sounding naggy or needy. 
3	Are you familiar with attachment styles? You seem to be like me--with an anxious style, we are constantly looking for reassurance that we are cared for. That's... fine, but it does put a strain on our relationships. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn an ENTJ/ENFP relationship, you're going to be the one nurturing the relationship more, but that's also okay. I've got an ENTP that's not the greatest communicator most times, but if I just let him do his thing for a while, he'll usually surprise me with how much he missed me and had been thinking about me. That's ONLY possible if we give them that space. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo say you highly value constant communication sounds insincere. Like it's covering up what you really need--assurance that he cares about you and thinks about you. You'll get that assurance if you let go a bit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope I don't sound like I'm lecturing. I have the same insecurities and they come up more often than I'd like. I was probably drawn to my ENTP (for better or worse) because of that insecurity. 
3	I hear you! Being left on read is torture. My INTJ husband has somehow learned that a simple thumb up or emoji is all it takes to avoid miscommunications once he's read a message. But, he's not great at communicating in general; letting me know when he'll be late has been a struggle since the beginning (1991).  \n\nI'd say that if someone you're romantically involved with doesn't understand when you calmly explain that it's important for you that they acknowledge your messages once they're read, you should consider if they're worth the frustration. Yours may be, but refusing to make such a small concession for something that is so important is a sign that they'll be nonchalant about your feelings in other ways. At least that's, unfortunately, my experience.  
3	I have a side that begins to wonder if in fact this's something that needs to be worked with some of us ENFP's.\n\nLike if we were more busy we would barely notice that the ENTJ hasn't responded and I think there's another element of this world being too connected.\n\nGet away from the need to constantly interact with others.\nTrust me, it can be maddening if it goes on for too long, and I feel like the human race is becoming addicted to using such devices as it is, to the degree that it's influencing our perceptions.\n\nDid you ever think that maybe the ENTJ looked at your message in a moment whilst he/she was busy sending an email off and decided to look to see what your message was, see if it was about anything urgent and because it wasn't he had to leave it and focus on other things?\n\nDid you ever consider that you are connecting your moods and value to whether someone gets back to you quickly enough?\nAnd furthermore, maybe that he doesn't actually mean anything bad by it, so reading into it as much as you have is possibly a tad overzealous.\nFurthermore, to connect a relationships viability to such things that are so miniscule in the grand scheme of things and in the grander scheme of things are just plain small-fry in a possible life-long relationship must be tiring to be you and as a result him.\n\nBack off the need for message validation it doesn't serve you, and consider this final thing.\nWould you be so bothered about hearing off your ENTJ this much if there was no such thing as electric based technology.\nLike phones have brought about the concept that instead of just have a thought and it pops into our heads, we think about it and move on.\nNo, now we have a thought we think about it, then we Google it or text that person and then until we get an answer on either we get stuck on getting an answer and obviously people aren't as instant as Google.\nWe aren't robots, sooo we end up in a feeling of waiting for someone else attention instead of just getting on with our own stuff.\nWhich can lead to feelings of anxiety when we attach the wrong thing to another's actions when they don't respond right away.\n\nOhhhh one final thing. Did you ever realise how much power over you that you give someone else when you are so needy to get a response off of them in this repeated fashion?\n\nOooh last one... It starts to become quite unnappealing for others, especially if they're busy to have someone need a response off them so badly and if they don't respond even more tiring to know that not responding leads to being hinted at and complained to eventually.
3	I broke up with an ENTJ for this reason. I never felt fully understood and connected. I then met an INFJ soon after and we'll be getting married now. So yeah. MBTI shouldn't be a reason for you to not date someone, but how they make you feel: that should mean something. \n\nThat being said, don't just break up with him for something like this. Talk to him about your needs, and see if it's something you can live with. 
2	talk to him about it! for me, it helps to know what the person is thinking when they're leaving me on read. If I know that's just the type of person they are to everyone and/or they're busy etc. I don't care as much. I'll just redirect my energies elsewhere to someone who is more willing to reply to my stuff. And I strongly suggest you ask him because making up reasons "oh he's just busy" etc. is not satisfying because you don't know if it's really true or not. 
5	Do you have trouble remembering/learning things?	I‚Äôm curious if I‚Äôm the only one and also hoping for advice. To clarify, my husband (ISTJ) remembers everything. He‚Äôs got an internal compass and always knows where he is. He can tell you the season and episode number in which a show‚Äôs particular scene occurred. He remembers random laws, things people have said, and which exit to take for the cleanest restroom in a small town he‚Äôs driven through once. \n\nI feel like I‚Äôm constantly talking to people who remember and make connections to things. ‚ÄúYou know, this reminds me of something the great MLK Jr. said.‚Äù I remember these sorts of things eons later, if at all. \n\nIs there a way to strengthen these muscles, in a sense? I solve my everyday forgetfulness with planners and whatnot, but can I ever get to the point I actually remember the stuff I‚Äôm not downright passionate about? \n\nEdit: Phrasing 
7	I'm very forgetful in general and sometimes it's an issue. I had one ex who really hated it and got extremely annoyed by it, threathened several times to dump me if I kept forgetting stuff about him (dumped him, lol). That made me think though, I consider myself kinda smart in most ways, but I stay forgetful. I tried apps that are supposed to help train your memory but didn't change anything.\n\nI do remember certain details about people I love and care about. I think a lot of my "forgetfullness" has to do with me being a dreamer. Even during conversations with people, I'm often drifting off in my head because certain things people say makes me think about something and then I start fantasizing or just drift off waaaay off in my head. So I don't always pay 100% attention to what people are saying to me in the moment so I "forget" stuff they told me. I also filter out a lot of info. I find it useless to store every memory and every conversation I have with people, no matter who it's with. I just don't like having to keep in mind everything about people, I can't be that focused. \n\nOnly things I really remember are things that really matter to me or that for some reason stuck with me because I like the memory. Or if it's something very dramatic and important.
5	A few points to this. \nISTJs are Si doms. Storing information for future reference and bringing up the past is pretty much their thing. \n\nWe though are future oriented. \nAnd our learning process is different due to Ne. We can soak up a lot of information like a sponge but condense the most of it to the core points we see as important. And store the rest as abstract knowledge that might be used later. \n\nIf I listen or watch something I find interesting or has to do with my passions I will hear it once and never forget it. I might not be able to articulate all of that knowledge out loud (because it's stored abstractly ) but if I think about it it makes perfect sense in my  head and the connections and different applications work super fast. \n\nLastly we all can use all functions. We just use them a bit differently and it takes more effort. When I was in school and had to memorize boring facts I just read them a few times a day for a few days and I could bring them up in the test without problem. \nSome of those facts I can remember pretty well still. Most of it is "lost" (stored without good links in my subconscious) though. \n\nThere are brilliant memorization techniques that work for everyone because the mechanisms apply to all of us.  
2	Wow, I am so relating to this. I am great at paraphrasing ideas and thoughts, but I will never be able to recite something word for word.\n\nEven just today I left a silly voicemail to my dogs groomer that ended with me not remembering my own phone number for them to call me back and I literally said ‚Äú...wow, so sorry, I can‚Äôt remember my number right now, but I will call you back‚Äù\n\nI am very reliant on my planner and daily journal to remember important information about friends, family, etc. If I don‚Äôt write something down I will 100% forget it ever happened. Never a dull moment!\n\n
2	I suck at spacial orientation and remembering where i put my things (in other words real life things don't interest me enough to remember them all the time). However learning ideas, theories, and lessons for school isn't really a problem. I think it comes down to N vs S 
2	This. Not so much a problem with trivia (I can tell you all the details and plot of the cartoons I watched as a kid) but with theories and facts or god forbid /details I swear aren't important/ remembering them clearly is a challenge and I'm always worried I'm not remembering them as well as everyone else. 
2	Yaaaaas! I‚Äôm so forgetful but, once I put something to memory I never forget it! It helps when i‚Äôm passionate about whatever i‚Äôm learning. As long as I can perceive a benefit to myself or my life in the subject, it can become a passionate pursuit pretty quick. Just need to process how much it will benefit my life; like selling myself something üòé
2	I can relate! It‚Äôs because I have so many ideas and thoughts in my head that I can‚Äôt focus on one thing that‚Äôs in front of me. \n\nAs a law student, this has been very challenging and has held me back a few years. But I‚Äôve learned that the best way to study is by removing all distractions (phone, the internet, etc) and just consciously focusing head-on to studying. I use the app ‚ÄúFocus‚Äù too when studying. \n\nAs to remembering things I use acronyms and visualize what I need to remember as I am a visual learner. 
1	Thanks for giving me my first grin of the day! \n\nIt always feels like a problem, but when you put it like that, I see it‚Äôs a strength in itself. \n\nEdit: I‚Äôm Redditing too early in the day. This is a response to u/mirotake. 
1	That makes a lot of sense. I guess I need to start looking into memorization techniques, as well as keep reminding myself that ENFPs just learn differently from others. It can feel alienating. \n\nEdit: Early morning. This is a response to u/jo8edogawa. 
38	A familiar ache	I've exiled myself from romance, passion, and sexual nature in general following a gruesome surgery that left me with an ileostomy and waste bag. I can't see beyond it to accept affection at this time...\n\nBut I feel the aching in my arms for a passionate hug, I feel the need to trace fingers, and hold on to another's hand as tightly as I can. I miss the subtle comfort that I used to feel with someone's head resting on my chest. Most of all I miss the energy that flowed freely from me, that feeling of all that explosive passion flying out of every pore across my body. \n\nI guess I miss physical affection.
15	I lived in fear of a stoma and the bag that came with one, you shouldnt exile yourself from love and affection on that premise, i hope you are okay.  
8	(INFP) - I'm sorry you're going through such a tough time. For what its worth, I'd give you a hug and I hate hugs from most people!.
7	Physical touch is a human need. Don't starve yourself of it.\nNot saying that means dive into a romantic relationship, but you can tell your friends about this and ask if they can be generous with hugs!
3	I understand you. I'm an ENFP and I am going through the same pain. Hope for the best and know this phase will pass too. 
3	my heart hurts for you fellow campaigner. \n\nhugs to you. fill up that cup of yours and take the time you need to feel better. accept not a drop less of the affection and live you deserve when you are ready. \n\nfor now, find solace in sadness and experience that.  You will get through this and to a point where you can see yourself for more than these things that are plaguing your ability to see positive potential in the possibilities.\n\ni‚Äôm so sorry, i hope you feel better soon and i hope you get the best hug ever very soon. 
2	hey I don‚Äôt know if this will help but I watch this girl called Hannah Witton on YouTube and she had an ileostomy and has some videos about living with a stoma and feeling confident and sexy with it - hope it can help to make you feel as deserving of love and affection as you truly are <3
1	(INTP). Just toughen up, who's to say that we need affetion to be succesful. All you need is self-determina...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFuck, it isn't fair. Not everyone feels like you do, you know? Why should gifts like that be wasted... But one thing seems weird to me. You say you can't accept affection? So is it you that is rejecting others? Why? I know the question can seem kinda obvious, but I care to know your version of the story.
10	Extravert Depending on atmosphere	I feel like anytime in in a room of extraverts I automatically turn on this "introvert switch". Idk why but I kinda get super reserved around loud people. But when I'm in a room full of introverts I tend to be at the center of attention. Idk if this is just a me thing or just an enfp thing. Anyone else relate?
9	Sounds like me. In a loud place, even if it's all my friends and such, I tend to become more introvert. I still have a good time though but it takes too much energy to shout over everyone else. Or those awkward moments you try to say something but people talk over you and you quietly die out inside.\n\nWith introverts I tend to be the center of attention yeah, I guess I like their calm and sentient minds. I feel like I can be more myself around them. And I although I love my extravert friends, sometimes I gotta be in a quiet environment. All guys I dated were introverts too and I really liked it. Some of my closest ENFP friends are the ones I have the biggest fights with. Because we both voice our opinion too hard (and a lot of misunderstandings), we clash. But it's always resolved within a few hours or a day at the most. Although I'm always the one initiating to make up, my extravert friends tend to be headstrong and stubborn and will rarely apologise first. But once they see I feel bad about it or let them know they hurt me, they apologise immediately and try to work it out with me. Being direct is key!
4	I usually like to think that I‚Äôm _letting other extroverts to take the stage_ ;-) I never enjoyed to compete for the attention in the room, it takes energy and I‚Äôm not interested in it IF there‚Äôs already another person doing what I would do. With introverts is different, because they‚Äôre... introverts, In that case, I like to ‚Äúbalance‚Äù and fill the room taking energy from others attention and putting it back into the room. I suppose this is a win-win situation after all.
5	It is the ENFP thing.  All types can do this, but ENFPs are most likely to do this, for Ne is an extroverted function, and Fi is an introverted function, but simultaneously Ne is different than the 3 other extroverted functions and Fi is different than the 3 other introverted functions.\n\nSo yeah it is very much an ENFP thing.  Now me explaining how and why you guys are different, well I just can't in a simple way =P\n\nBut you will learn this truth by experience but also from a theory perspective it also makes sense, of what **Ne is** *vs Te vs Fe vs Se and so on.*

0	Jimmy Fallon is a dog in human form. He's always excited to see everyone, smiles regardless of what is said and just wants someone to play a game with him. **I think he's an ENFP**	
2	He has been one of my very favorite comedians since I was a girl! Even had a little crush heehee
2	I love his enthusiasm ‚ù§Ô∏è 
1	He's an annoying spastic imo\nhttps://youtu.be/8ibaqXleIGQ
1	I dislike him, and it‚Äôs hard for me to dislike people unless they‚Äôre evidentially immoral. I perceive him as inauthentic and sneaky in ways he draws attention to himself. Maybe just a TV persona thing coupled with insecurity.\n\nThen again, maybe he reflects some parts I don‚Äôt like in myself? I see a pattern of me disliking ENFP characters and personalities (but not real life people).
33	Do any other ENFPs have a special affinity for INFPs?	I've always been curious about this. I'm an ENFP and married an INFP. Almost my entire (close) friend circle is made of INFPs (or INFJs). Not that I discriminate against other types‚Äîit's a total coincidence. And I keep my friend circle wide because I like talking with lots of different kinds of people. \n\n\nBut I get so starry-eyed about my INFP friends & husband because I think they are precious souls & gifts to a world which does not deserve their empathy & talent. Is it just me? Do you guys feel more drawn to particular types?\n\nEdit: Hopefully this much is obvious, but any two people of any type can have a successful relationship with communication. I don't mean to belittle that. I just think the pattern of my lived experience is interesting, and I wonder if it's a larger pattern.
10	Happily married to an INFP for 18 years this April. Best decision of my life!  
10	I'm in a new relationship with an INFP man and it is simply the most intense, passionate, loving, intimate relationship I never would have even allowed myself to dream of. It is literally everything I have ever wanted. He is the most sincere, loving, honest, accepting, non-judgmental, thoughtful, considerate, talented, noble man I have ever met. He is a precious gem. A beacon of love in this world. He brings out the best of me and all others around him.\n\nHe is a textbook INFP, and if that's the case, then they are perfect human beings.
7	Insta-kindred spirits. It‚Äôs ‚ÄúI already know I like you!‚Äù within the first couple sentences or once I get a sense of their vibe. This doesn‚Äôt happen very often.
7	We have natural chemistry. I did not think I would like ENFPs until I met my best friend tho... but now I have seen the light. I love how goofy you guys are, it really balances out my sadness sometimes haha. 
6	I‚Äôm okay with them! I‚Äôm more attract to Thinkers . However, I have a very close infpfriend, she is basically my mental support sometimes, like I rely on her sooo much bcz she is full of empathy so talking o her about my emotions is easy and don‚Äôt need explanations. But sometimes I also feel she has to be a bit more socialized and handle more things altogether.
6	(INFP). Aww. That's sweet.\n\nI thought about my exes after doing MBTI. The majority of them were probably ENFPs, and I don't have any harsh feelings about any of those relationships ending. Two tested ENFPs after taking the test, the other I just have a suspicion. ENFPs have a way of being able to enter and leave my life with no hard feelings that no other type has.\n\nOf all the types I'm "compatible" with, I seem to run into them the most. Rather, they seem to seek me out the most. I'll just be sitting in the corner at a party and BAM, ENFP asking me questions about what I like about the music playing or something.\n\nAs a sidenote, they're one of the few (if not the only) "feeler" types I have an immediate sexual attraction too. I tend to be exclusively sexually attracted to thinkers.
3	Yes. 
3	Majority of my friends are INFPs and INFJs :)
3	Thinking introverts in general.
3	I think I do
3	We love y'all too. <3 - INFP
3	Some of the closest people in my life are INFPs! I also have a soft spot for INFJs.\n\nMy partner is an ENFJ. (:
3	Hell yeah.\n\nMy BF who's my best friend and 2nd bestfriend who's also my bro in law are both INFP's. \n\nThey're the closest people to me in the world. More than my own family. And I love them to death. \n\nThey are such beautiful sensitive souls. And I have a real soft spot for them. I feel like they bring out the best in me and I feel so incredibly authentic and genuine around them.\n\nKindred spirits for sure and I cannot imagine my life without them. \n\nWe have such a deep emotional connection. \n\nThey're home. \n\nWith my BF, I got the love bug for him hard and fast. It was instant. I couldn't get him out of my mind. He felt the same. We started dating like a week after we met, had our first kiss on our first date and slept together on our second date. \n\n¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø\n
2	My girlfriend is an INFJ. We‚Äôve already been on several road trips together. Just celebrated our one month on Monday! It‚Äôs been smooth
2	Dating an INFP right now... Sure I guess you could say that
2	I'm dating an INFP and I absolutely love her personality
2	Likewise for us INFP's.  I have one close friend and he is an ENFP.
2	My first heartbreak was with an INFP and I'm still attracted to INFP since then
2	My best friend is an INFP and she is literally the sweetest soul that ever existed. I met her through a crush I had who was also my friend who was an ENTP. We were sorta a trio. I couldn't tell if the two were interested in eachother or dating. We were at Sonics and they missed something on our orders so my crush went in to fix it. Leaving me and her in the car. I ended up asking her if they were dating. Apparently they have been dating for a while, they just didn't want to say anything or make a big deal cause they didn't want me to feel like the third wheel. Which warmed my heart and soul. I admit, what I did was a little bold and risky. I had no ill intent, but I did ended up confessing I had a crush on her boyfriend for a bit. She had showed nothing but pure love and understanding of my feelings, it honestly kinda threw me off guard. That was honestly the moment we have become best friends. It was a struggle but I did eventually got over the crush and became content with being friends, because I wanted nothing more but to respect them and their relationship. We have planned to get together this weekend. I have a lot of INFP friends, she is my INFP bestfriend and I adore her. 
2	Absolutely!! I always say INFPs are my favorite type (INFJ coming behind that). I‚Äôve been dating my INFP girlfriend for almost five years now. It gets better every day and we‚Äôve never even fought. My roommate is also an INFP. My life is super peaceful because of them. 
2	Oh hell yea, I like the silent, quiet, charming person they are and the way we just click and get along! :)
2	So far most of the friends I had turned out to be ENFP, ENFJ or INFJ.
2	Yes!!!!
1	I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n- [/r/infp] [Do any other ENFPs have a special affinity for INFPs?](https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/asn2f6/do_any_other_enfps_have_a_special_affinity_for/)\n\n&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
1	YES! I was talking to my INFP friend about this, and she was like "you're really a slut for INFP's" two of my good friends are INFP's and my sister whom I am very close with is an INFP. my theory is that they help us tap into our Fi, since it is their Dom function. (and we help them tap into Ne of course) every time I hang out with an INFP, I get a similar feeling; I feel stabilized in a strange way. I feel like their truthfulness and authenticity really helps me tap into my own; they make me less afraid to be myself and stand my ground. I also trust them so much because of this. LOVE infp's
1	TBH, my INFP ex treated me unkindly.
0	Rest of the types are trash, romantically. Except maybe enfj nurse
3	ENFP distancing and being somewhat mean after opening up?	So I have this ENFP friend who I have known for 6 years and we talk everyday since 3 years. We‚Äôre both 26 years old and we work in the same company.\nI have been wondering if he has a crush on me and I‚Äôm sorta crushing on him.\n\nSo I had this long talk with him over the phone last Friday where we opened up how we thought about relationships and on some point I even asked if he would date a colleague and he said no, never. So that‚Äôs clear... but okay it was a good talk, no weird stuff and uncomfortable moments.\n\nBut since then his texting activity towards me went down a lot (in contrast) and he rarely made initiative to start conversation. So I asked him if he was okay like 3 times during conversation and he ignored it. \nHis activity in group chats however has somehow grown and he even made some comments where I could interpret it as being mean to me. \nSo I asked him again personally; if I could just ask it one more time, is everything okay? He replied; what should not be okay? So I said no idea but if I did or said something would you tell me. He only said: stop it.  And that‚Äôs that.\n\nI‚Äôm kinda angry about it because I don‚Äôt feel like this is being nice to me...\n\nIs this the result of opening up? Or would he have the thought that I like him or something and wants to shut it down? I don‚Äôt know what to do.\n\nI want to bring it up again as a friend but scared that if I chase him away as a friend, I also loose a friendly colleague and therefore our whole group of colleagues with whom I hang out a lot....
2	Give him some time to process this thing. It's clear he's trying to avoid you for some time and he's looking for social interaction (maybe to _distract_ himself? maybe he's confused? whatever). Don't bomb him with questions, wait for a bit (a week, maybe more), then try to talk with him again. I admit, however, he's acting more like a teenager rather than a 25+ person.
2	Hmmm. Doesn‚Äôt sound like an ENFP. But, if he is, may be he‚Äôs just bothered too much about the question because it reminds him of a bad experience or a person? I suggest stop asking him the same thing, that personally stresses me out especially if I haven‚Äôt worked out the right words to say in particularly sensitive situations. 
2	When I sense someone crushing on me while I don‚Äôt find them attractive, I might end up distancing myself from them. Not saying that‚Äôs the confirmed case here, but I can see myself in that situation. I can foresee a scenario where you just confess that you have a crush on him straight up. That would force him to confront the situation, and even if he rejects you, that will clear the air. He might not deserve your effort with the way he‚Äôs been handling it, but you can think of it as doing it for your own sake.
6	How to win back an ENFP?	For months I was in a flirty chat with my ENFP crush. He would text me all the time, we bonded alot. Few weeks ago I got a bit upset by him not respecting my boundaries, I let him know that... aaand after that everything just stopped. Now Im trying to build the relationship back, he said he isnt mad at me and he still laughs at my jokes and all but it's just not the same & I dont know what to do. 
10	Uh, if he's not respecting boundaries and is anything besides apologetic when you mention how you feel about that, that's a red flag you should pay attention to if you want to be more than friends.\n\nIt really doesn't matter how serious of an offense it was. If you say "it matters to me that you haven't respected this thing that matters to me" and the response isn't "wow, I'm so sorry, thank you for telling me how to be a better friend," you need to be very careful with that person. If that's how they treat casual boundaries, are they going to treat more serious boundaries with equal flippancy?\n\nIf you're asking me, don't try to win back that ENFP. You can do better than that.\n\nBut at any rate, if you want to rebuild the relationship, it's just gonna take time. If he's truly over it, you'll get back to where you were.
2	Just tell him this. Tell him how you feel how you felt your boundaries weren't respected but you still want to continue talking and even move forward. Ask him what he wants and what he feels.
1	Depends on what happened between you two. 
1	If I'm honest, I've tried to date ENTJ's myself and found them to be rather unmoving when it came to anyone elses opinion but their own, making assumptions that ignored the feeling factor of a partner.\n\nLike I'm not saying that you specifically are like that, but it's something to consider because we're only hearing your side of the story, and most disagreements are 50/50 or close to 50/50.\n\nIf both parties wish to continue cohabitating both should at least work to discuss things towards the ends of coming to an agreement that benefits both sides and leaves both sides feeling heard.
2	What are some hobbies or interests you have narrowed in on/ committed to?	
6	I joined an improv troupe. I like the combo of performance  and teamwork. I have a very serious job, so I enjoy the chance to be silly. 
4	I love cooking! And unlike all the other hobbies I want to commit to but never do, it‚Äôs got the opportunity to be practical. 
2	Seeing live music, being in a band, going to art galleries, visiting exhibitions and festivals, going for walks in the park by myself, journalling, redditing, drawing, painting, writing poetry, writing songs, trying out a new bar each time I catchup with someone, clubbing/dancing, training my dogs, binge watching a show, doing a beauty pamper day for myself, and recently cooking.\n\nI'm very busy :D
2	Drawing and painting (I made it my career) and at home I love cooking to wind down and relax.\n\nBut since I want to do everything, I also sew, taught myself guitar and piano, I am constantly working on comics and writing stories, and I go swimming, hiking and running regularly. I‚Äôm a whirlwind of hobbies and interests. The most important hobby I have... napping.
1	Cycling.
1	Reading, learning to draw, enjoying music, learning new things.
7	Messing with my fashion?!	Hey there amigos,\n\n     I think we are all familiar with how us ENFP types (and others, I accept all :)) at times feel like we have multiple personalities and illustrate ourselves as basketcases. I‚Äôve noticed that this  ‚Äúidentity disconnect‚Äù as i‚Äôve dubbed it has extended outward to my wardrobe. Does anyone else feel this?\n\nIn HS, I was a weird mix of slightly goth/rocker style most of the time. And now as I approach 30, I am still drawn at times to that style. However, sometimes I prefer to just dress as an old man because it‚Äôs simple and comfortable. Why can‚Äôt I just keep a style!? It‚Äôs like my personality transitions dictate what I like to wear as well!!  Gah!!!!\n\nBe well, my dudes.
2	I think I have a strong grasp on my identity and so I find that I don't understand how people connect their identity to some sheets of fabric that are sewn together, doesn't make sense to me.
1	I agree. My friends said they hardly know what to buy me for my birthday because my style keeps on changing. 
1	I have a couple go-to styles. Usually I dress in a stylish, urban way with my personal twist to it, but I sometimes have my preppy golf-player and chav phases.
1	My outfits change based on the activity and my mood, but for some reason I will always have one unintentional statement piece in my outfit that people always comment on because it‚Äôs different, even when I to dress normally... I think I naturally can‚Äôt. Born to be fantastic, I guess.
1	When I was in HS, I wore jeans and t-shirts. Now that I'm approaching my late 30s, I wear jeans and t-shirts.
1	Same here. Mainly like rock/punk style but I don't fully fit in that picture. Some days I'll be wearing all black, showing off my tats and piercings. Other days I'll wear a red, flowery dress and open shoes. Other days I'll be wearing something basic and casual. And sometimes I walk around like a hobo (mainly at home). I feel great in every kind of style, it's just fun and feels right. Doesn't feel like fashion is "part of me" though, it's something fun to play with.
1	yeah I am the same, I have a few different styles and my style changes too. 
1	I wear many different styles depending on my mood. Why limit yourself?
3	I often read posts here about ENFP- INTJ relationships. Is the film 'Paterson' a good example of one?	I'm an ENFP (male) and I identified with her so much. I completely see myself in her treatment of Paterson.  Nurturing and encouraging, believing in him more than he did himself.\n\nI also see myself in her constant drive for adventure and new opportunities, as opposed to his silent reflection and comfort in routine.\n\nIt really touched me that they could be so different and work so well together. It's what I hope for in a relationship.
1	Intruder allert... infp here,	I resently found out about this mbti-jizz. Idk alot about it to be honest. I'm supposedly an infp. I refuse to label myself tho, so don't worry about that.\n\nCould you guys tell me the distinct difference between e/infp. Im asking this because I think it's lame to google it. \n\nThankss in advance. \n\nxoxo,\n-friendly neighbourhood infp\n\nI'm Dutch btw, so sorry for my English.
2	It really comes down to cognitive functions. I'll try to explain them a bit but you should look into it on your own if you are curious enough. \n\nINFPs and ENFPs have the same cognitive functions, its just INFPs lead with their introverted ones while ENFPs lead with the external ones. ENFPs are Ne (extroverted intuition) dominant and have Fi (introverted feeling) as their second. INFPs are Fi dominant and have Ne as their second. There is also Si (introverted sensing) and Te (extroverted thinking), similarly these are reversed in order for INFP and ENFP. \n\nWhat this means is that INFPs live in their Fi, its like the air around us. its always there and you don't notice it until it hits you in the face. An INFP is very aware of whether actions jive with their internal ethics based on how they feel. The "golden rule" is very Fi for example "Treat others as you would like to be treated". Someone Fi dominant is also going to express how things make them feel a lot, rather than expressing more generalized things or "factual" things. However this Fi is backed by that Ne which means the INFP is using their intuition to explore ideas and dive deeper into their values and understand them more. The Ne helps make connections and provide those "Eureka!" moments. Ne is pretty cool but also always strives for new information, its a curious thing. \n\nThe ENFP is very similar, just leads with Ne and is backed by the Fi. ENFPs are constantly using that intuition, gathering information and making connections. Imagine brainstorming all the damn time, we can't turn it off. Because of this the ENFP often seems distracted or disengaged from reality because their head is in the clouds. The second function is Fi, so it is something that ENFPs have easy access to but it takes a little bit of effort. However because we don't live in our Fi its easier to see when it pops up, and when it does we will use our Ne to explore that Fi to understand it. At times this means that an ENFP goes inward and seems really introverted, but will soon emerge with new insights and seeking validation for by asking lots of questions of others. \n\nTo speak more practically and feeding into stereotypes. INFPs are like  reclusive artists who have a lot of depth and creativity, who wear their emotions on their sleeve, who spend a lot of time in their head thinking about their depth as well as creating stories about what is happening in the world. An INFP is pretty comfortable spending a lot of alone time exploring their own depth. \n\nENFPs are easily distracted and very excitable, enthusiastic to a degree that makes some uncomfortable and can be seen as ditzy at times. ENFPs like to start things and pick up hobbies really easily, but rarely follow through or master things unless they dedicate themselves. \n\nI'm trying to exaggerate the differences. There are plenty of similarities in how these types really function in the world. ENFPs can appear to be INFPs when they dive into their own depths and meditate, while INFPs can appear to be ENFPs when they yell YOLO before skydiving. Both types share a strength of Ne and Fi that makes each type incredibly curious, expressive, and self reflective. The difference largely boils down to the difference between leading with Ne and leading with Fi. 
1	(INFP) Do you find that you feel more stressed out by being around people too long or not being around people long enough? ENFPs supposedly also have introverts moments where they like to be alone, but they'll start getting unnerved if they don't get social contact. I am the opposite. I get super de-centered if I am around people to long, and in order to get back into a feeling of balance I like to be alone.
1	ENFP is just an INFP with social skills.
1	INFP is not the introverted version of ENFP. We have our functions in a different order and think differently. ENFPs are Ne-Fi-te-Si, INFPs are Fi-Ne-Si-Te. You don't have to be extroverted to be ENFP. I have no friends and spend pretty much all my time at home for example. But I'm ENFP because I lead with Extroverted Intuition as my dominant function. The E and I in types just says whether your dominant function is extroverted or introverted. And to Jung that just meant it was either directed outward and wide (extroverted) or inward and deep (introverted). It doesn't really have anything to do with how you get your energy or if you prefer to be around people a lot or not.\n\nThe biggest difference we found when talking with an INFP about our differences was that INFP's need everything to relate to them or their values personally for them to be interested in it or find it important. Like everything. If something isn't related to them it is silly and not worth their time. And they judge everything. They judge first with Fi then expand a bit with Ne to see other possibilities within that framework. ENFP's use Extroverted Intuition freely, then filter through our values of Introverted Feeling to see if it aligns with what we believe. This allows us to see many more possibilities without limit, many of which an INFP would never think of because they are too abstract from themselves.\n\nI tried to play a creativity exercise with him where you imagine a spoon and think up others things you can use it for besides eating. I could go all day thinking new things but he couldn't really do it. So I framed it like he was on a deserted island and only had a spoon, what could he use it for to survive and he was able to think up things.\n\nENFP's also have Te as their 3rd function which allows them to be more efficient, organized and action driven when they develop it, as well as assertive. But INFP's have this as their inferior so aren't as good at any of that. But on the other hand they have Si 3rd while ENFP's have it inferior so they are better at routine and connecting this to memory and experience and nostalgia while ENFP's are bad at routine and rebel at feeling controlled.\n\nIf the function stuff is confusing check this: https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/if-youre-confused-about-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-read-this-an-intro-to-cognitive-functions/\n\nhttps://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/12/how-each-cognitive-function-manifests-based-on-its-position-in-your-stacking/\n\nENFP deep function description: https://www.typeinmind.com/nefi/\n\nINFP deep function description: https://www.typeinmind.com/fine/\n

10	(INFP) I love this! Great work! The color blending is so good. 
9	The blues and purples that you used in the clouds are really lovely!\n\nDoes this painting mean something in particular to you?
5	Oh my god, this is true to its core, I dont see graphic, I see conflict and purity. Kudos to you!
3	Beautiful! \nI wanted to start drawing myself... Is this an acrylic or oil paint? \nWhat do you prefer? How long are you already painting?
2	I love it‚ù§Ô∏è Well done.
2	That is so beautiful! You're talented :)
2	AMAZING!!!

2	I love it. I feel like it conveys comfort, that there‚Äôs someone out there for you.
2	awesome work!! i‚Äôd love to see that hung up on a wall

1	This is beautiful! Thank you for sharing. <3
1	Your clouds are friggin phenomenal. 
1	Not at all graphic! I love this. Really beautiful and well done 
1	I feel a delicate vulnerability in this one. Reminds me of a person being rebuilt. Really neat, thank you for sharing! 
1	I adore her! I love the abstract nature of the painting, your use of various hues to portray the sky. Her hair gives her an amazing uniqueness. Well done. I hope you found the inspiration and new form you were looking for.

3	ENFP speed-paint tutorial	I just found this ENFP fan art that I posted on Youtube last semester. I did the fan art in 1 hour. Hope you guys enjoy it! \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXGif1EzybM&t=3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXGif1EzybM&t=3s)
3	Feels like an ENFP-energised performance! :) :D	
9	Losing my relationship with my childhood friend	  So I‚Äôm an INFJ and my best friend growing up is an ENFP. We always enjoyed each other‚Äôs company and did practically everything together. Over the last year and a half though, our relationship started to suffer. He started to neglect me and leave me out of things. There were many times when I depended on him for something and he didn‚Äôt come through. There was a time when he drove me to social gathering, but made plans afterwards with other friends and left without me. I was able to find a ride home, but it really annoyed me. First he forgets that I‚Äôm depending on him to get home and then he makes plans other plans. To top it all off, he texts me hours later, after I‚Äôm already home and tells me where he went. He was apologetic about it and I forgave him, but I can‚Äôt say it doesn‚Äôt bother me anymore.\n  I felt like I wanted to confront him about it, but last year was our senior year in high school. Now I rarely see him anymore since he moved away to college and I stayed home for school.\n  Do any of you guys have problems doing the same thing he did, or something like that? I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs anything to do about it, since we never see each other. I don‚Äôt know. I felt like posting this since it‚Äôs been in my mind recently and r/infj doesn‚Äôt like ranty posts like this. Sorry for bothering you lol...
8	ENFP here. I‚Äôve (shamefully) been guilty of the same and it still eats at me. Tell your friend how you feel!
6	Well, I think it's best if you'd meet up with him face to face and directly ask him about it. ENFP's tend to be honest so straight up ask him. You deserve to know why, as some closure. I can't imagine ghosting one of my best friends. If I do cut people off who I knew for a long time, I tell them exactly why. 
3	ENFP here and I always appreciate very direct communication! I think sometimes we tend to get caught up in the excitement of the moment and the energy we get from other people and forget to 1) pay attention to how others are feeling, even if they're not saying it and 2) prioritize our relationships in a healthy way. I find myself throwing my time away on people who don't care about me too much just because they'll have a handful of deep conversations with me (or even one), which really feed me. But it's like junk food. Luckily, when I discuss conflicts with my introvert (especially NF) friends, they're very understanding and appreciate the honesty. There's obviously variety within ENFPs so maybe your friend is a bit different.\n\nI've done what your friend did before and often I have to bring it up with my introvert friends (and husband) before they tell me how I made them feel. They don't always want to discuss it, but I think ultimately we're both happy it was discussed so that I can modify my behavior and try to listen & prioritize better next time! You have to remember that ENFPs tend to be verbal processors, so any time you can discuss feelings and situations with your friend, your relationship will be stronger‚Äîassuming, of course, that's what you want. As an INFJ, you may want to evaluate how important this friendship is to you, because you only have so much time and energy for friends. If it's not feeding you anymore, this friendship may be worth letting go of. If you let it go, try to do it in a way where you can appreciate what you had with your friend, and what he was to you, and try not to hold any resentment. \n\nI hope that helps!
3	Ive never done the *exact* thing your friend did but yeah, its been a common issue in my life where one of my best friends growing up felt abandoned by me once I went to college. And it hurts me to say that I ended up unintentionally gaslighting him for bringing it up because I was too selfish to see the problem and had a lot of work to do on myself. I regret that. At the same time, its of course more complicated than can be explained in a reasonable reddit post. \n\nAs an ENFP its really easy to only think about stuff in your immediate world. Its easy to go weeks without talking to friends if you don't have a reason to talk, and that time between meaningful interaction weakens the bonds rapidly for the ENFP as they gather new friends and have new experiences with those friends. What makes it harder is that the ENFP isn't intentionally ignoring people, they're just distracted, but getting them 1 on 1 they are able to be that best friend again in those moments because we don't forget (Si). \n\nAt the same time there are two sides. Unless people have had discussions on the nature of their friendships, its pretty easy for there to be an imbalance of expectations. I don't doubt that the ENFP was your best friend growing up, but were you their best friend? This may not be so obvious to you. What you went through hurts, and you are justified in feeling that way. But if you really want to know whats up, you'll have to ask. I can say it took a few times of my friend trying to get me to talk for me to be truly honest because I don't like hurting others' feelings. Its easier if you are confident in what you are saying. Even if you feel the time to discuss it has passed, really there isn't going to be a good time to discuss things like this. Assuming you feel the need to communicate this to your friend. \n\nIf you don't want to, you should move on from the friendship. Its easy to get caught up in wondering why someone is doing what they are doing, and its usually not malicious but it still hurts. Leave the door open for the ENFP to eventually reconnect. But move on to other friends and adventures. 
2	It's sad I had friends that I've known since elementary and once I moved up to north Dakota for work a couple of years they basically quit calling and are short on the phone. Most died from the military or drugs or suicide, or cancer. I'm sitting at 2 total at the moment. 
1	Be straight up. You two have known each other for so long that it‚Äôs worth talking about. Even if the relationship isn‚Äôt salvageable in the same way, at least you‚Äôll get closure.\n\nThe reality can also be that you two are just on separate paths. There are a lot of factors that can play into this. Be firm with your ENFP. Tell him to be honest with you because you want to understand what happened.
5	Weekly Support Thread	\n/r/ENFP has always been and will always be a place that lends an ear. Large or small, get it all off your chest. In this corner of the internet, you will be heard. We are here to support one another. We are all we have.\n\nThis doesn't replace the individual posts; it's just another avenue to start talking, MBTI related or not. Sometimes you need to check in more than once before you feel restored. That's what we're here for.\n
1	Very light hearted for a change, but my new boyfriend and I are still getting used to sleeping in the same bed together. We always start off cuddling but eventually we have to be less locked together to get proper sleep. He falls asleep a lot more quickly than I do, and every time I try and pull away gently, he wakes up and gets all "are you okay?" :')\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast night he had me in a pretty tight hold and his hand was like, on my ear, and pulling my face in this type of shape: [https://memegenerator.net/img/images/300x300/16429913.jpg](https://memegenerator.net/img/images/300x300/16429913.jpg)   And he was so deeply asleep that I kept it up for about ten minutes until I couldn't handle the pulling anymore and dragged myself away. He snorted, shot up and asked the usual "did I hurt you, are you okay?" He's always so panicked and worried: I'm fine, really! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe'll figure this sleeping thing out eventually! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
23	The perfect job for ENFPs IMHO	I‚Äôve been a flight attendant for 2.5 years and I honestly think this is the perfect job for ENFPs. You don‚Äôt have a normal 9 to 5 job. The hours you work are extremely flexible. You will never get bored. You get to interact with humans all day. When you need to introvert, you get to stay in hotels by yourself and not interact with people at all if you don‚Äôt want to. But at the same time if you need to extrovert more, someone in your crew is almost always down to do something fun on a layover. You can get layovers where you have friends / family so you won‚Äôt ever feel that separation anxiety because you know you can see them again soon. You have free flight benefits (you fly standby) so you can go explore the world when you need an adventure. I‚Äôve felt ‚Äútrapped‚Äù my entire life - like I‚Äôm stuck in the same location or doing the same thing over and over again, but this job has changed all that. You are able to get a lot of time off, like work all your hours for the month within 2 weeks and then you can have the last half of the month to follow other creative interests. Our bubbly personality and adaptability is exactly what airlines are looking for! I could go on and on but I felt the need to share! Anyone else have a job they feel is perfect for our personality type? 
11	i work in IT project management and organizational change management and i love it. i very rarely get bored and interact with a lot of interesting people. \n\nedited to add: because i‚Äôm in IT and can speak technical but am also outgoing and bubbly, EVERYONE wants me on their projects, which is super fun and fulfilling!
8	I'm a senior in high school and I honestly have no idea what I'm going to college for. All through high school I've wanted to have a career in engineering or technology because I love math and science, but after discovering Myers Briggs and talking to a new friend I thought I'd enjoy counseling or social work more. The problem is that I want to make money but also enjoy what I do. Any suggestions? And a flight attendant does sound cool but I've been having really bad anxiety so I don't know if I could do that tbh
6	I do construction and honestly, the pay is good and it's varied enough to keep me going.
4	Awesome thread!! I love this, especially being an ENFP going into the workforce. Thank you!
3	Actually I want to be a flight attendant but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôd be able to since I‚Äôm 18 not only that but I don‚Äôt know if I have to go to school for it. Some people say you don‚Äôt have to but I‚Äôm not sure.
3	I am an INFP but I‚Äôm healthy and bubbly enough to be mistaken for an ENFP. I‚Äôve just applied to become a flight attendant for the exact same reasons! I need to explore the world to feed my creativity. I need days off to actually write the books. I also need to meet people and understand them.\n\nOne point you missed is that being a flight attendant requires you to take care of your health and be puntual and productive. Many ENFPs and INFPs fail to do these things on their own. So it‚Äôs a great training to address our weakness and become better people.
5	ENTP or ENFP	Hey guys! I am having a little 'existential crisis' these days and have no idea if I am an ENTP or ENFP. (I used to type as ENTP) Could you guys help me on this? Many thanks!
3	If you were with a group of good friends and everyone said they really wanted to go eat at this one place and were all jazzed about it but you really wanted to go to a different place would you say anything? Assume like 3-5 or more people.
2	\nI‚Äôm 19 and a female.\n\nI spent my entire life in China and then went to the US for college. My family is generally pretty lax. Due to the One Child Policy, I am the only child in the family. However, I visit my hometown every year and enjoyed spending time with my cousins. \n\nMy dream job is a multidisciplinary designer and a visual novel artist. I am interested in the STEAM (STEM+Arts) education movement. My ultimate goal is to use visual design to create new knowledge to inspire more people.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n‚Ä¢ If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI would feel refreshed at the beginning since I will have a lot of me-time to think, daydream, and practice drawing. However, too much alone time could make me feel bored. In this case, I try to take a small trip (like a walk) outside or chat with my friends via social media. \n\n‚Ä¢ What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nBoth outdoor and indoors. When I was young I enjoyed things like outdoor adventures with friends (where we played games like hide and seek) and storytelling (coming up with my own stories). I suck at sports lol. \n\n‚Ä¢ How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about?\n\nI am very curious; I always try to know about things that are interest and look at the different perspective about a certain issue. Now both STEM and arts interest me. (When I was in primary school I used to be very interested in creating games; when I was in junior high I used to discuss with one of my BFFs a lot of quantum physics and philosophy; I was very invested in chemistry communication in high school). \n\n‚Ä¢ Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nYes. I will ensure that my team is doing things effectively. At the meantime, I will also make sure that the well-being of my team members are good. I do not want to be a control-freak. \n\n‚Ä¢ Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity.\n\nI am not very coordinated lol. I do enjoy working with my hands through crafting. \n\n‚Ä¢ Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nYes. (I initiated a sci-art program with 5.2k followers, and I often get my illustration work featured on ‚ÄòArts and OCs‚Äô amino.) My graphic design works are like vector graphics and have a good-looking colour scheme. My illustration style is like a hybrid between Japanese manga and American comics. I enjoy hyper-realism art, surreal art, illustrations, classical oil paintings. \n\n‚Ä¢ What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI sometimes look back on past mistakes, but I don‚Äôt dwell on them because it is non-effective to do so. I tend to rationalize past mistakes and think about how I can improve. I think about the future a lot; I am generally optimistic about my future. \n\n‚Ä¢ How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nGenerally speaking I would love to help them, except if their request is out of my abilities or I am busy at the time being. If I decide to help them, I would be responsible in giving them the best help. \n\n‚Ä¢ Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nMost times yep. However, being spontaneous and following the heart sometimes can be fun.\n\n‚Ä¢ How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nTheoretically speaking I value efficiency and productivity, although I am very prone to procrastination and could be very unproductive lots of the times. \n\n‚Ä¢ Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI do not wish to be controlled or control others. But I sometimes do networking to promote my sci-art and illustration works via influential people (donno if that counts as controlling others)\n\n‚Ä¢ What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nReading books, watching documentaries and musicals, writing novel, doing some brain-teaser science questions on [www.brilliant.org](http://www.brilliant.org/). Stuff like that.\n\n‚Ä¢ What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI prefer classes involving creativity. I struggle with learning environments where quantified academics achievements (e.g. GPA) are considered the ultimate factor of a student‚Äôs excellence. I also dislike environments where teachers refuse to accept student‚Äôs point of view because the teacher is the ‚Äòauthority‚Äô. I like learning with fun games, brainstorming sessions, and projects. \n\n‚Ä¢ How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as I go. Damn. \n\n‚Ä¢ What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\n1. Being a top designer in the world and make a good contribution to arts and culture. 2) Trying different interesting things in life, taking on adventures, and engage with interesting people. \n\n‚Ä¢ What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nI fear being mediocre, failing, and losing my freedom to pursue my aspirations. \n\n‚Ä¢ What do the "highs" in your life look like?\n\nI am passionate about the things I care about. I am optimistic about my future and cheerful. I keep in touch with my friends often. I am emotionally balanced.\n\n‚Ä¢ What do the "lows" in your life look like?\n\nI am very stressed and tend to think about many negative outcomes despite that I know they are not logically true. \n\n‚Ä¢ How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI love daydreaming but I make an effort to become more aware of my surroundings. \n\n‚Ä¢ Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nI would like to get out lol.\n
2	it‚Äôs hard to type, as i‚Äôm unfamiliar with china culturally (i‚Äôm am asain american born and raised in LA) and your writing is pretty formal and pointed, not tangenty or explorative of ideas or conceptually colorful and playful as would be expected from a ne dom. it‚Äôs dry conceptually \n\nthe best i could say is not to limit yourself to just enfp / entp ; it‚Äôs possible that you could be \nisfp or enfp. entps don‚Äôt tend towards visual arts - fe is more auditory and te is more visual, so entp it‚Äôs less likely \n\ni suggest reading up on cognitive functions (for example you‚Äôll learn that creativity isn‚Äôt only for intuitives , its a function of ni / ne, which you could have developed well) \n\nafter learning and understanding the 8 functions you‚Äôll be in a better position to re-examine yourself 
1	‚Ä¢ How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nIt really depends on the decision itself. When it is a decision which relates to my strengths and weaknesses, I tend to make it really quickly (since I know about my strengths and weaknesses well). Most of the times I tend to procrastinate on important decisions since I want to explore more possibilities and see which one will work.\n\n‚Ä¢ How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nThis is actually a good question. Most of the times I am pretty emotionally balanced. I consider myself as a cool-headed, ambitious, alpha-female. I don‚Äôt get offended or angry often. I have never got mental problems before. However, I give my friends and my host mom a vibe that I am passionate, heartfelt, and people orientated. In high school, I was called by my homeroom teacher ‚Äònot like the other girls‚Äô ‚Äòrational and objective‚Äô. My high school BFF also used to think I am a typical thinker, but now she thinks I am more like an ENFP. I used to invest a lot of emotions and be very dedicated about the things that I love. Also, I am often moved by sad anime/movies and tend to write a lot about feelings, identity and ‚Äòwho am I‚Äô in my novels.\n\nI like telling my friends my appreciation to them because I really care about them and admire what they did. I am fine with crying in public and confessing my emotions, but I don‚Äôt want to be too emotionally wishy-washy because I don‚Äôt like people to regard me as weak.\n\n‚Ä¢ Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nSometimes yea, especially when with my BFFs. I do that because I don‚Äôt want my BFFs to get offended (I know many of them get offended more often than me).\n\n‚Ä¢ Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI am pretty authority-challenging. I used to break a lot of rules when I was in junior and senior high--I got into many troubles and almost got suspension for breaking rules. I disregard rules since I think they stifle my personality and creativity. To this day, I am still skeptical of the educational system, but I try to break less rules since I need to bend to some rules to lay a good path for applying to design grad school in the long term.
30	Met an ISTJ, as an ENFP I made advances towards this person with no shame, not expecting anything back. He surprised me with this moment, I was so inspired by the out of character act that this happened. Our first and last kiss. This spontaneous act on his part scared him. Do I feel too much?	
4	Awesome experience and awesome drawing!  Congrats!
3	This sub can be so wholesome, I love it. This comic is the cutest.\n\n~IxTP
6	Handwriting of an ENFP?	Is it my handwriting really that bad or it‚Äôs an ENFP thing that comes with it? My teachers parents always said to me that I have a bad handwriting, they said it looks like a doctor‚Äôs text on a prescriptionüòÇ what abt you guys, any thoughts?
10	The quality of my hand writing varies greatly. If I am clear in my head, I am clear in my writing. If not, it‚Äôs just scribble. 
3	Mines fairly bad. 
4	I'm  16 and my handwriting  is like an old experienced doctor . When i was little everyone used to say that my handwriting  looks like an older persons handwriting . I didn't  have that decent simple handwriting from my very early age.
3	I haven't seen anything consistent with my ENFP friends. I have excellent handwriting but some of my friends are like you. 
2	My teacher said I had a pretty great talent in calligraphy actually. 
2	My handwriting is terrible always! Except when it‚Äôs not and then I‚Äôm really proud.
1	How do you write so welllllüò´
1	Ahhh I see but sadly I‚Äôm the opposite of that :(
1	OMG IKR!!! Ppl keep telling that to my face, they even said I should be a doctor üòÇ

3	ENFP Anxiety	Is anxiety common with ENFPs? \n\nI first started experiencing anxiety last year (my junior year in high school) and I think it was triggered by all of the stress I had built up in my life. I had a controlling boyfriend at the time and we had been dating for almost two years. I think the constant need to please him and keep him from getting upset may have caused it but I really dont know. \n\nI was in Spanish 3 and I was just thinking (probably about stressful stuff) and all of a sudden my chest tightened up and it was hard to breathe. I was terrified and thought I might be having a heart attack. I went to the nurse and she took my blood pressure and said it was like 140/90. She made a pretty big deal about it and had my mom call my doctor. The doctor said to rush me to the ER so I for real thought I was dying. I couldn't sit still in the car and sitting in the waiting room was torture. They checked me out and said I was completely fine and that it was probably just anxiety. I had it for probably a month after that and it eventually went away. At the time I was going to church regularly and had a really good support system. Me and my boyfriend did eventually break up (I think he was an infj), and I also stopped going to that church to avoid awkwardness. I got with an ESTP shortly afterwards.\n\nLast April I joined the Army Reserves and went to basic training over the summer. My anxiety never got too bad there. Sometimes I was pretty anxious at night time but that's it. Then this last Christmas break it came back and hasn't left. I mainly get anxious about having anxiety and then I'm worried that something bad will happen if my blood pressure gets high or stays high. I'm currently on anxiety/depression medicine so it hasn't been too awful, but I'm just tired of feeling this way. I'm 18 years old and I'm sick and tired of being scared 24/7. I just bought my first car all by myself and I can't drive down a highway without freaking out. I honestly feel emotionally alone because anxiety is just irrational and everyone knows I'm okay and that it's just anxiety, but it's so much more than that. I sit in class and I'm scared. I drive and I'm scared. I try to sleep and I'm scared. Its mainly just the physical effects of anxiety that terrify me. Like blood pressure is the biggest one. I'm afraid it will get too high or I'll have it too often, but I'm told I'm healthy and that it shouldn't cause any problems because it's just anxiety causing it. \n\nI'm sorry for the rant. I just want answers and peace. I'm tired of wasting my life being scared of dying or bad things happening. I look at people and I'm like "how are they not freaking out?" "How do they have such peace?"\n\nDoes anyone have any advice, or can relate, or anything? I really would appreciate it. Please don't say anything that might scare me lol. I already know I'm healthy I just feel like I need assurance non-stop to stay sane. I just want to live the life ahead of me and be able to focus on school, work, my family, my relationship, figuring out my college/career plans, and going to AIT ((Advanced Individual Training) for the Army) this next summer (which I'm dreading). I just want to experience being happy again and not just temporary moments of happiness. \n\nI wanna thank everyone that takes the time to read this‚ô°
9	Anxiety is living in the future or the past, not in the present. Getting more in touch with your present surroundings will help. This is called mindfulness. Meditation is a good tool for this too.\n\nIf you feel intense anxiety  try the 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding technique.\n\n-Look around and notice 5 specific things around you. Really look at them. Notice colors, pasterns, etc.\n\n-Then notice 4 things you can feel, could be the chair your sitting on hard on your butt, your pants, your phone or mouse, heat in the air or cold, etc.\n\n-Notice 3 things you can hear, you may not think there are 3 but listen very carefully, even your own breathing.\n\n-Then 2 things you can smell.\n\n-Then 1 thing you can taste.\n\nAfter doing this you will find hopefully the anxiety has lessened. Also you'll be amazed at the stuff you never noticed before!\n\nIf you have a panic attack check this out: https://www.anxietycoach.com/overcoming-panic-attacks.html\n\nIt's been a life saver for me and my anxiety.\n\nit's ok to be afraid. Say that to yourself. Because it is.
2	Back in high school I was in a very similar place to you, ENFP dating a controlling INFJ, and honestly, not to project onto my ex, but so much of my expressed anxiety can be traced back to that time of my life. I‚Äôve struggled with having panic attacks daily for almost a year now, and I am pretty inclined to stay away from medication. In my experience, establishing a routine really helps me control my anxiety- nothing strict, but since you‚Äôre in the army reserves, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve felt the difference between living a more structured, controlled life and the opposite. Meditation, spending time barefoot outdoors, and thanking the Universe for every person, article of clothing, art, and food I have all help tremendously too! A wise old fella told me once that ‚Äúanxiety is your body squeezing out trauma, think of it like making orange juice,‚Äù not sure how much that will resonate with you, but it made me smile, so hopefully it‚Äôll do the same :-) \n\n& it is perfectly normal to be scared! I left an abusive relationship and for months would break down in a panic if anyone even touched me! Tell yourself that you‚Äôre safe and allowed to feel scared! Honor your body and mind, and the Universe tends to bring resolution that wayüíú

3	Identity Crisis in Regards to Creative Pursuits	Hello everyone,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope this is okay here. I don't know where else to go, and I think maybe another ENFP is just what I need to solve this issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't to make a long post so I'll try to be brief. My whole life I have felt like music is my calling. Music is everything to me, and being from a musical family with some music talent I thought that I would always be a musician. But as a adult I never play music. I always chalk this up to being lazy, but lately I'm starting to wonder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLately I've been starting to draw. I can't tell if it's because of the novelty of it but it's something I've been wanting to do. I never want to play music, though, and now that I want to draw instead it's thrown me into some bad thinking. "What about music?" I keep asking myself. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can't help but feel that I have made music so important to myself that I can't fathom life without thinking about me making music. I have seriously not put that much time into music. I've put more time into video games than music. I feel like maybe I'm holding myself hostage or something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHas anyone gone through this in some way? I just don't understand. I've always wanted to make music, or maybe I liked the idea, but aside from jamming my favorites on bass I never want to *create.* Only play when I feel like it. As for drawing, lately I've been wanting a creative outlet. I can *see* things in my mind, not hear them, but see them. I never feel creative in regards to sound, only images and atmospheres.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm really hoping someone here can help me, I don't know who else to ask. 
4	If you want my honest opinion, I think you are overthinking it. Don't worry I do the same thing. After all I went through an art style crisis. \n\nIt's ok to have more than one creative outlet. It's ok if you enjoy being a musician for the fun of it. It's ok if you don't write music but enjoy playing your favorite songs. You don't have to be the best musician in the world. \n\nIt's also ok to enjoy drawing as well at the same time. I think what's scaring you is that you are worried you are somehow betraying yourself. That is the thing about us, well at least for me is that we are constantly looking for our identity. You identified yourself with music so you are worried about betraying that. \n\nIn reality you don't have to chose one or the other. They bring you happiness in two different ways. There is nothing wrong with that. Just try to relax and enjoy them. That is the wonderful thing about hobbies, you are not obligated to just stick with one.
5	Okay, I can relate to this on soooo many levels. \nOne thing I‚Äôve come to understand about myself is that, I don‚Äôt have to choose, there are so many things I want to do and having to decide stresses me out, so much that I end up doing nothing at all. \nSo now I try to focus a few things at the time. I might do all of it, I might not do any of it. It‚Äôs all okay. I need to go with the flow and do what feels right in the moment. \n\nYou‚Äôre not forced to be ONE single thing, to have one single interest or be just the same, always! \n\nMany actors, artists, musicians, painters, designers and writers haven multiple creative outlets. There are many famous examples. They grow. They evolve. They experiment. \n\n
1	The great thing about being a creative is that you are not limited to your pursuits. I knew I wanted a creative career so I became a graphic designer, but more than that, I still paint, draw, illustrate, sew, play music, cook, read, get creative! It might be my waves of passion that make me a master of none, but there is nothing wrong with doing more than just one thing. I just do whatever I enjoy in that moment. I knew I was good at drawing, so I‚Äôve made it my career and to balance the work, I give myself other hobbies, like cooking, playing music or sewing clothes. \n\nBut remember this, you can do anything but you can‚Äôt do everything. Don‚Äôt put too much pressure on yourself to perform to someone‚Äôs (or your own) expectations and you‚Äôll find what you enjoy the most.
2	If you were to create a poem/stanza/ poetic sentence about where you are at in your life what would it be?	
4	Why am I like this, can anyone tell? Fitting in but not really, can't do either very well.\n\nA need to share but afraid to show. What truly is inside, the complete whole. \n\nThe contradiction is straining, but I figured it out. Will just be me, authentically, spreading good vibes around. 
3	Nobody cares about who you want to be.\nYou will die and nothing truly matters.\nBut that's what makes you free. 
230	Here's a thing I did	
15	Looks like a beautiful hurricane, it's gorgeous.
7	I like it, reminds me of an eyeball, with vibrant color. What was your inspiration/motivation behind it?
3	OP that really turned out.  Congrats.
3	AMAZING. I want to eat it with my eyes!
3	I like it. Reminds me of donut. No offense. I like donuts...
3	For some reason I feel really drawn to the iris of this hurricane of colors...very nice.
3	Is that from the Lorax? üòç
3	Is this on a Mirror, too? 
3	It‚Äôs absolutely amazing and I love it. I feel like Tom haverford when he is relating to the abstract piece because the color clustering here is just right on and I can‚Äôt explain it 
2	It's beautiful! 
2	Omg, it reminds me of feelings. So many of them all swirling together \n\nNice work!
2	And what's the meaning of it?
2	I really like this
2	Is that a mirror? Oh my God. It's sooooo beautiful. Like I can imagine looking into it and the bright and vivid turmoil of colours around me.
2	This is a very fabulous doughnut. I like it. 
2	that asshole is hypercolor
2	This makes me immediately want to scream with a very neutral emotion. I... I dont know why
2	I'd love to use this as the artwork for one of my songs
2	Pardon me, are you Kara Thrace? \^\_\^
2	Rainbow unicorn hurricane! Yay!
2	Circles, rings, vortexes, and rotational symmetry are all symbols of the ENF type. I always used them in my user icons, even before I knew I was ENF.\n\nAlso, a rotating body with an emptiness or void in the middle is a deep metaphor for the ENF personality or soul. (I can explain this in a less mystical-sounding way if someone interested replies to this comment.)
2	Thank you guys!!!\n\nAll of this support makes me feel awesome! It's rare that I'm happy enough with a painting to show it in public, but I figured I'd try it out with this community and I was Not disappointed. Love you all!!!!!!!\n\nüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòçüòçüòç
8	ENFP-A dating advice	Hello all! I recently have been dating an ENFP-A guy and have been enjoying our dates. He was kind to me and begged to take me on sweet dates. He planned our dates in advance and was very particular about where he was taking me to. An overall gentleman. He rushed to open my door and everything. After each date he would quickly plan the next date doing his best to keep me around and we enjoyed each other‚Äôs company. The only issue I had is he wasn‚Äôt flirty with me. He‚Äôd tell me how beautiful I am. Give me compliments but when I asked why he wasn‚Äôt flirtatious with me or silly/goofy and always serious, he blocked me on all social media and phone. May someone give me an idea please about what this means? Thank you. 
16	Holy shit mama drop that sucka and move on. Life‚Äôs too short.
9	Wtf? He blocked you cause you asked him why he wasn't flirty?? Oh wow.
6	If he wants to block you instead of talking like and adult, then you dodged a bullet
5	This doesn't sound like an ENFP issue. Idk why he blocked you, maybe you brought up something that made him feel insecure. 
6	hoooly crap, that's not enfp related. it's a person specific issue. 
3	Thank youü•∫üå∏ I told myself that and hearing that from you makes me feel/know betterü•∫üò¢üò¢ You and everyone who have responded are so amazing. I truly am grateful for your responseü•∫üíùüå∏ Thank you my dearüå∏üò¢
6	The End of The Fxxxking World	Hi guys. Ive just finished watching The End of The Fxxxing World. I think the girl Alyssa is an ENFP and the guy James is an INTJ. I feel like the series portrays the best ENFP and INTJ relationship. Have any of you watched the series?
2	Alyssa is ESFP to me. I can't decide if James is INTP or ISFP. 
2	I‚Äôm not so sure about James (although he‚Äôs certainly some sort of introverted type) but Alyssa struck me as an ESxP, leaning ESFP, because her decisions (often fast and impulsive) seemed based more so on her feelings than logic\n\n(Granted, I haven‚Äôt watched this in a bit)
2	It was quite boring imo but that's just me. I expected something "bigger" instead of angsty teens running off and going through random events. Nothing really made sense, didn't understand what the series is even really about. It was a bit too random.
1	I think she is too logic-driven to be a feeler (even the chemistry between those two is not about feelings). She seems like ENTP or even ESTP. ü§î
1	I think she is ESXP
1	I just came to say that I love that series. \*backs away slowly\*
1	Yea she is fucked up enfp,agree. And James is obviously intj
3	I made a song and a music video that some of you might relate to	
3	The Paper Kites: The Perfect ENFP Band	Discovered them a couple of months ago through Spotify, and went on one of their concerts in Vienna this month. The videos and music itself just describe the feeling of being an ENFP perfectly.\n\n[Revelator Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fi4T-yR8tM) (have just recently discovered a similar vinyl bar in my own city, love it!)\n\n[Electric Indigo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWF5_wdqQj0) ("I don't like people, but I do love dancing!" lol)\n\n[Give Me Your Fire, Give Me Your Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybparFEZf2I)\n\nAnd many more! Check them out, really. You won't regret it! :)
2	Yesssss they‚Äôre greattt. Got me through some tough times
20	Heres a picture i took yesterday. Nothing special. Just a car on a busy highway. What's your opinion on editing images?	
4	An edited image is just another way of perceiving reality. We each perceive reality differently one way or another, and editing allows us to see things that we would otherwise miss. I think it‚Äôs great.
3	Editing pictures, and photography by itself can be such crazy skills, and can make a photograph 10x better. Cool picture btw 
3	That's not a picture of a car. That's a picture of The Flash.
1	Ooooh, was it a long exposure? 
10	Hey ENFPs, I made my own EP from scratch over the course of a year and released it in November. Here's one of the tracks. I'm singing, playing guitar and keys, and I produced it via Ableton. If you like it, check out the rest of the songs! Much love	
1	This fucking kicks ass man! You‚Äôve got yourself a new fan 
78	Let's talk about this subreddit and ENFPs in a nutshell	Ok, so I lurk here more often than not, and I've made a couple of posts here, and while this place is lovely at times, other times it's absolutely predictable and disappointing. I never spoke out on my thoughts of this subreddit, and internet ENFPs as a whole, but I feel like the ENTP in this place more often than not. It's a constant stream of "DAE RELATE!?!" mixed in with the stupid manic pixie stereotype, it's as if this subreddit is actively trying to act to a stereotype defined by tests such as 16personalities. ENFPs have kind of gained the reputation of being "Happy Stupid Butterflies with ADHD", seriously? None of you have issues with this? It's nothing but a constant stream of repetitive memes and random emotions. I have no issues with the Therapy, in fact, good on some of you guys trying to help others, but the constant stream of screaming Fe gets tiring. Where's that juicy Ne goodness? Where's the creative masterminds? Where's any of *that?* Enough of the "DAE relate to post from 2010 about being sad butterfly????????". Another thing, as I already mentioned is that absolutely **stupid manic pixie stereotype**.    \nMBTI is prone to stereotypes, of course, I understand this, but that doesn't mean you act towards it? No, just because your ENFP doesn't mean all ENFPs are emotional, exictable, bubbly, or any of that. It's a correlation, not a causation, I have no issues with any of those terms of course, but people seem to be faking it most of the time. "i'm very bubly per son yesss :DDDDDDDDDDDDDD" or just \n"Oh my godddd I relate <3 <3 <3 I jus luuv INTJs!!!", is a satirical example but you get what I mean here. Feeler =/= Emotion, Feelers are more oriented towards people and values, not emotion. Perhaps this is just my raging cynic speaking, I tried my best not to offend anyone, but I just felt like something had to be said about this.
38	My Ne doesn‚Äôt like public speaking :P It likes actively adventuring out in the real world, making itself known in small groups or likes to hang out in my own head brainstorming and creating. \n\nI get what you‚Äôre saying though, the annoying stereotype feels strong here at times. ‚ÄúOh gee, another post about relationships or how we‚Äôre all golden retrievers and/or unicorns? For fucks sake, use the search bar before you post!‚Äô is how I feel some days. \n\nI think some of this is due to the sub seemingly skewing to teen and college aged people who are still figuring out themselves and the world around them. Not saying everyone in that age group is going to be the ditzy manic pixie stereotype, but that‚Äôs likely the tendency for ENFP in those age groups who are yearning to connect, learn and experience things.\n\nSo I just put my blinders on most of the time when browsing here and ignore the content that doesn‚Äôt pique my interest. 
11	I feel like most posts here are more of a dive into Fi. Ne activities are something I do naturally, almost effortlessly, and usually express this in the outside world. Ne is my stereotype, Fi is who I am, and what I desperately want to develop in my path towards Authenticity.\n\nI'm not trying to speak for other ENFPs, but just to explain what I enjoy about this subreddit. A nurturing safe space for introverted extroverts.
12	Very good post... it is exactly what I am thinking.\n\n>Where's that juicy Ne goodness?\n\nJuicy! While I completely enjoy the Fi circulating around here with the occasional vent post (and tbh this here is exactly what I mean with a vent post :D) where is always someone there who just gets you, I just think we are foremost not only feeler but **ethics and people oriented excitable intuitives**, which is not displayed that well. I wished more people had the courage to just post an original idea no matter how stupid, just to see something else or interesing that rises above the conventional dae and meme stuff. We're not completely devoid of it with the latest example is probly [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/arjl1h/tried_4acodmt_for_the_first_time_and_felt_super/) :)\n\nI still think, overall the sub is in a okay-ish situation right now. It could be much much worse.
8	And I tire of INTJ memes where we are super knowledgeable people who are insightful of the essence of the universe and the universe does not get my genius (aka House MD or Sherlock form the BBC.)\n\nOr the INTJ sterotype of us being moody bitter people who are tired of social bullshit.\n\nAnd a whole other host of things...\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou have to ask what this place is for?  1) Is it here to be a fun place that ENFPs will naturally enjoy like ENFP disneyland?  2) Or is a place where people vent and post the ephemeral things they are feeling in the moment?\n\nFor if its #1 you have to understand there is low incentive structures for an ENFP to dedicate a lot of time and energy here to make something, that another ENFP will enjoy.  There is no money, and there is no form of other good that is not capital / money but has some utility, there is nothing that is being produced and is utilized and reutilized and so on.\n\nThus it has to be #2) it is here to be low quality content that is produced empherally by the posters and not for the sake of the readers.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt has to be #2 and it can't be #1 unless things in this forum are meant to last, and they can't last due to the reddit algorithim.  \n\nFurthermore it can't be #1 unless you build "small blocks" that over time "assemble into larger blocks" and these larger blocks can be reconfigured to suit the needs of the moment.  But hey I am going to stop explaining this last algorithim for I do not want to get into the details of explaining objected oriented programming, or what makes a meme into a meme, for memes have to be copyable (where the copy does not destroy the original, the non destructibility of the original), they have to be editable (so the copy can change the original), they have to tap into some form of archetype even if its not a primal archetype they have to be recognizable, and they can be contextually reconfigured to the moment.  Yadda, Yadda, Yadda and this is how you create wikipedia.\n\nBut as you can see here with my example of wikipedia this beautiful crystal palace also has its own downsides for it is so hard for people to become editors and learn the arcane forms, and you lose a lot of the ephemeral sharing via having such a rigid formalistic perspective designed around reuse.  Reddit should be about play, and due to the rules of being text only and so on, ***you are only going to get a simple form of play.*** A more complicated form of play would be something like minecraft or some other thing where you can create, but what is created is pure empheral.  Yadda, yadda, yadda.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat I am saying here is life is full of many places, and each individual place can have its own purpose.  ENFP the reddit is not going to be the one stop costco that has everything that the ENFP needs in their life.  Here let's have a Ni heavy video to further elaborate the point I am making.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXTnl1FVFBw\n\nOh while the speaker in this youtube video is very much a Ni heavy person, the philospher he mentions at the end with the concept of hetertopia, well he is an ENTP *wink.*
7	Thank God someone said this. I am an ENFP but don't fit the manic pixie stereotype. I can be very friendly, outgoing, and in tune with emotions and feelings but I also use a lot of dark humor and am not exactly "bubbly". Makes me feel a bit left out sometimes but I know other people like me exist. 
7	As an ENFP I agree with this post. I think MBTI is interesting and such but certainly not the answer to everything. Whenever I see an ENFP post and see comments, I see that manic pixie type crap too and it honestly is so cringey and annoying. It seems so forced as if they want to prove to everyone what a hyper, little ball of randomness they are. There aren't many \*real\* comments, thoughts and posts. I wish to see more of that. The 'typical" ENFP authenticity seems to be hard to find..
5	Hey, I feel you\n\nMany of the type-related subs are ‚ÄúDAE‚Äù and stereotype-heavy. It seems like a lot of people discover MBTI through 16personalities\n\nIt‚Äôs interesting what you said about Fe. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if there were some mistyped ESFJs here because we share Ne and Si\n\nBut, anyway, I just pop on here every now and again to see if there‚Äôs an interesting discussion or to talk about the functions because there aren‚Äôt many choices, sub-wise
4	Agreed - this sub feels like it has a lot of ESFJ energy 
8	I understand what you mean haha. Though I have had quite some very interesting and thought through discussions on here, it just depends on the topic of the thread. I do agree with you that those stereotyping threads can be a bit tedious sometimes, and like you said, 16personalities like tests should be banned (hehe), they dont say shit. People literally type opposite so often, because they dont like themselves. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTrue typing comes through reading and reflecting on cognitive functions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
4	I am also tired of seeing the ENFP stereotype everywhere. It‚Äôs fun for a while, but we are so much more than that and we are all so different 
5	Every time i read manic pixie I cringe hard. I've been on here less because I don't want to be the one telling people that "this is a meme anybody from any type can relate to". I just think: well maybe people smile from this or the other post, might as well shut up. But at the same time those repetitive posts lead to me getting bored of this.
4	This shit hella true, feel like majority of this subreddit are vulnerable little crybabies. This shit makes me not wanna be associated with other ENFPs, thanks for speaking up about this
5	I've seen this argument in here before. I agree there often are the same posts in here over and over. But look at the posters. They are all by different people, not the same ones. Always new ENFP's coming in with the same problems others had before. So although you don't like it these are what many or most ENFPs are and what they go through. It is a commonality. A predictable pattern.\n\nBut I don't think it represents all ENFP's. I think most ENFP's are not on Reddit, they actually out doing stuff and having fun and using Ne. The ones who come here are lonely or heartbroken. They need help. Often they are not as mature yet, so are still experiencing the strong Fi and emotions of youth. Haven't developed Te or Si as much.
3	I generally agree with this post. Going to play slight devil's advocate to stir some conversation:\n\nBe mindful that this subreddit is targeting a small subset of people that have some case of the "stupid manic pixie" stereotype. Similar to other subreddits, not necessarily MBTI focused, it's natural for people to bond with others through some shared similarity, so for the case of r/ENFP, it should be no surprise to see these stereotypical ENFP posts here and there.\n\nYou're absolutely right that people should focus on tackling against the stereotypes, but only if they realize that they will be happier when they successfully do. There is no objective definition of "weakness" when it comes to personality, because everyone has their own interpretation of who they are, whether it would be someone like us with highly developed Te, or someone else who's generally more cheery and happy. There's no right or wrong answer when it comes to personality; only new perspectives and ways of viewing the world.\n\nMy suggestion would be to just let them experience life and let them live to their fullest potential. I used to be that "stupid manic pixie" until life kicked me in the ass. It was through my own personal hardships and accomplishments that had lead me to develop my Te. For an ENFP facing adulthood, let them face their hardships and develop their own Te at their own pace, because they will soon understand that life isn't always rainbows and butterflies.
2	Overall I love this subreddit and it does engage my Fi a bit. I was skeptical of your rant at first but thoroughly pleased with it. \n\nWe definitely shouldn't confirm to the crazy happy butterflies, but instead be "whole." That includes Ne, Te, and Si.\n\nAlso, there is our shadow self which is a whole story of its own too... Pretending to be playful 24/7 is but a facade. \n\nI guess this is probably true of every MBTI subreddit and I think maybe the reason people confirm to the stereotype is because it's a safe place to do so... Not everywhere can you be accepted for acting like a lovely rainbow hippie butterfly creature :D\n\n
6	Thanks for sharing... usually when I find a sub's content to be unbearable, I unsubscribe from it instead of continuing to be displeased by its posts. Or you could follow the advice of my favorite human, Gandhi, "be the change you wish to see in the world". You say you mostly lurk, so maybe contribute some of the creativity that you feel the sub is lacking.
4	such a stereotypical enfp response to being stereotyped.\n\njust sayin'  ;)\n\none of my best enfp-friends automatically doesn't like something prefaced by, "check this out you're going to love it!" he auto-reacts in the opposite direction to anything that projects a feeling that is not his own onto him.\n\nthis is no different. it's fine. just realize it's happening here.
2	Also...the snowflake complex a lot of y'all seem to have. There's so much stuff that gets posted that is just normal people stuff. Furthermore you aren't more intelligent or emotionally mature than the people around you simply because you got a cool combo of letters on 16p
2	I agree, but I think the manic pixie posts tend to be by a select number of excitable younger females. I can say that because I was probably like that 15 years ago! Haha\n\nLet 'em be :)
1	THANK YOU!
1	Agreed. I'm more interested in discussing how the mere subjective nature of morality is indicative of how it essentially means nothing and holds no real weight therefore nothing is good or evil they're all just the results of our need to break things down in a way that is conceivable to our limited understanding and intense self preservation. The notion that literally nothing can be factually stated to be evil is creepy as fuck. Let's talk about THAT and  how your psyche's react to the idea. What are people? What is even happening?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou feel what I'm saying? That's what I spend my days thinking about. Always doing shit in my enviornment and going on mental trips in reaction to the stimulus. I am constantly experimenting with ideas usually centered around human perception and acting this out. Playing with different versions of what I can be, or what other people can be. I go on here hoping we can unravel the spiderweb but it seems like it's such an internal thing for ENFP's. 
1	My main issues with this sub are 1. "Does anyone know why my relationship with a ENFP failed?" posts that proceed to have absolutely nothing to do with mbti. 2. "idk what my type is" 3. "idk what i wanna do when i grow up" posts. Do we have an FAQ that explains that enfps always question their type and they change their mind every 15 minutes about what they wanna do? \n\nI'm not very good at verbalizing my Ne. I feel like the things I find interesting are not things I would spend anytime posting about because I just want to read about them. If they come up in conversation I will explain all the things I know about them but otherwise just keep them to myself. 
1	I don't know if I have ever had an ENFP friend. \nI've had friends of other types and we would have wonderfully deep conversations and make big elaborate inside jokes. \nI spend most of my time alone though. I come up with ideas and run through things in my head but I don't have it in me to follow through and do something with them. UNLESS I have a good friend, like my INTP friend, who's good with that sort of thing, then we do it together. \n\nI'm not very active on this subreddit, I mostly just lurk. I am often surprised by how relatable a lot of the things posted here are but yeah a lot of it seems to be a caricature of ENFP. But I don't mind.\n\nI go to other MBTI subreddits too. \n\nBut really I don't see much that's very deep going on in Reddit. Sometimes the science subs I follow got some interesting conversations happening but most of the time they're just dead, feelsbadman\n\nI just reply when I have something to say. Maybe someday I'll make friends on here but mostly I am not gonna have anything brilliant to say unless I feel like I know the people I am talking to.
1	I am an infp. I do appreciate enfp relationships a lot. My enfp best friend is so caring and understanding. I have trouble keeping in touch with people I love but never with her.
1	mbti isn‚Äôt prone to stereotypes , humans are\n\nthe solution is education, done in a positive matter of fact way\n\n\n\n(not a emo-barf way)
0	Dang, now I feel bad for loving the stereotype. :(
-3	‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the juicy Ne?‚Äù Excuse you, my last post here was about projecting sentience onto a pineapple and caring for it as my own. 
-1	I mean, I get what you are saying, but I also don't know what the hell else you expected to find here.  
-4	poop in my mouth
384	Think this belongs here	
35	Why are we so full of paradoxes? :D
14	I don‚Äôt mind sharing my life story with a random stranger, but I‚Äôm not about to talk about my insecurities. So I feel like this is super accurate! Lol!
10	Ouch.
10	Haha , this is spot on . Example - wife and I were recently  out for a dinner date before having our 4th and last baby . Waitress comes over , small talk pleasantries exchange , I ask about something on the menu ... next thing I know I‚Äôm telling this young woman a funny story about our birthing plan ... I mention that our doc call my wife‚Äôs Vagina a Vag .... I think I mentioned something about smoking pot lol she literally said ‚Äú wow , thanks for sharing all that ‚Äú . fast forward a week or so  I‚Äôm at work I‚Äôm the boss and owner of a small BIz and I‚Äôm getting ready to take some time off , help out around the house etc . A co worker mentions she didn‚Äôt even know we were pregnant .... yeah well mind your own missy , I‚Äôm NOT trying put all my business in the streets , it‚Äôs none of ya‚Äôlls bussiness , it‚Äôs my personal life , geez . 
7	That hit too close to home
4	When you tell your girlfriend every detail about the shit you just took, but don‚Äôt tell her about your sister in laws baby shower that‚Äôs coming up... I don‚Äôt try to be super secretive. I just forget people can‚Äôt read minds? \n
10	Nope. Im not oversharing. Im not telling anyone anything if I dont trust them, so they are my close people. I talk too much about everything but not sharing THE things with just random people. I dont need to talk about problems/things to resolve it like in 99% cases
2	Painfully true üòÇ
2	Ugh, I am dealing with so many self problems related to communication issues. I wish i would be quiet! >:(
2	This is one of the things I hate about myself the most (how is that for an overshare?). I‚Äôve ruined a few relationships this way. \n\n\nI‚Äôve been working on creating appropriate boundaries for a couple years, but my ADHD doesn‚Äôt help. Some days are better than others :)
2	Okay first of all how dare you 
2	I feel like as I get older the more secretive I become lmao
2	Lmao yo i‚Äôm an enfp and i scrolled down and got mesmerized by the picture before even realizing what sub the post was from. 
2	Me: tells about all of her issues some dude she sees for like 3rd time in her life\n\nAlso me: swears not to tell anything about her issues her mom or her best friend\n
2	Wow. Is this really an ENFP thing? If it is, I‚Äôm even more impressed by Myers-Briggs. 
1	I can relate to this on a deep level and I‚Äôm an ESFP lmao.\n\nI‚Äôll be willing to tell my life story to some random cashier at the coffee shop but I can‚Äôt let anybody know about my obsession with typology reeeeeEeEeEe
1	Lmao, as an INFP I've experienced this with my ENxP over sharing supervisor who was attracted to me, only just as I was ready to connect and share with him, he shut me down. /life\n\nMBTI does explain so much sometimes, haha.\n\nI'm trying to move on, but sadly I tend to attract mostly straight up introverts with a lot of hangups, who can be too 'in their head' for me.\n\n&#x200B;
1	wow personally attacked
1	OMG so painfully true!!!! I usually overshare about my life even about everything in my -e.g kinky fetishes - with total first time met strangers that I find comfortable talking with. But I barely share my true emotions or in-process decisions.  
12	When you are conversing with 4+	The urge to grasp attention. The WANT to be recognized or acknowledged. Those things are better left for groups of 3 or less. Our tendencies leave most people with a bad taste about us. 1.) insecure 2.) attention seeker 3.) know it all 4.) annoying. \n\nWait for more than a second of silence to chime in unless you‚Äôre prompted by someone to respond. Practicing listening skills is VITAL. We overlook it by interjecting and trying to give advice because we are so passionate about helping, that we fail to realize that our behaviors can put an immediate halt on future information they wanted to share. Don‚Äôt distract. \n\nObserve. It‚Äôs worth it
2	A probable ENFP here...Confused about career choices	I'm 19 and I study Biotechnology in college. I don't think I fit in this place.For some reason,I don't feel inclined towards this field and can't engage myself naturally into it.I really appreciate the hidden beauty in the way biology works and how scientists use it to create better things but I don't see myself doing that.I'm planning to pursue an MBA after college as I want to start a little something of my own.However I don't know what do I want to do it for : A biology related product or something else which is more creative.And I don't even know if I have it in me to go that way and if I really really want to do this.That said,I know there are a few things that I naturally do and know I like :\n\n\n\n\n- I find metaphors and symbolic references in random places or objects \n\n\n- I love making up music videos for songs in my head and then imagine acting in them\n\n\n- Watching a lot of movies and analysing the stories,looking out for subtle meanings and the actors expressions.\n\n\n- Theatre.Since I was a kid,I always wanted to be in the school play(that never happened.I was never in any play)\n\n\n- I love fiction and beautifully complex characters...Any books with interesting storylines and that are realistic at the same time.I wish to write a novel someday\n\n\n- Observing people's nature and immediately understanding them..\n\n\n- Giving advice (not that I'm great with following it)\n- Coming up with interesting yet really big and unrealistic ideas (that I want to bring to life)\n\n\n- Encouraging people and supporting them to be the best version of themselves \n\n\n- Understanding people's skills (I am really great with this one..Somehow I just know what a person would be great at doing)\n\n\n\nDoes this all amount upto something resourceful?\nIs there anything I can do to apply myself?
2	I'm still confused on career choices. There are so many to go into. I usually change every 1-3 years depending on how much I enjoy it. But I usually quit because I'm not getting paid enough or new management or no promotions.
2	I think many ENFPs are confused about career choice. This is a VERY common post here and maybe it would be helpful for you to look through the search function to read about everyone else's struggle. I would suggest you don't pursue an MBA unless you really want to. You don't need an MBA to start a business. \n\nHere are some things I'm imagining when I read through your bullets: stage director, stage tech/manager, performer, therapist, life coach, social worker, educator, speech pathologist, reading interventionist, librarian, community organizer, manager, sociologist, psychologist, researcher, nurse, doctor, medical technician, etc
1	I‚Äôm a fellow enfp, I‚Äôve been working as a graphic designer for many years now and i find it very rewarding, I loved studying with like minded creatives, and would willingly stay overnight at school, I never studied well in high school because i wasnt interested in what I was learning. I‚Äôm well into my career now and the things I get to do keep me on my toes. I‚Äôm creating visual solutions for people daily, stretching my creativity and it‚Äôs really worthwhile. Apart from my day job as a designer, I do illustration on side, I‚Äôm always creating something and telling visual stories from what I see in the world. Don‚Äôt be scared to pursue creativity, your sensitivity to the people around you can be really effective in a workforce. When you study and do what you love, everything will fall into place, there will be little room for doubt when you find what you love.

1	Yeah. I'm pretty sure my dog can smell anxiety. 
1	Which one, the human or the dog?
1	I am that dog. 
20	I always hated long weekends and holidays but I discovered solitude has its benefits	I am in my early 20s and I live alone. My relationship with my family is broken. I have a lot of negative feelings of abandonment and grief within me. Too avoid those feelings I became addicted to many things. None of them worked.\n\nAnd I realized *I have to sit with the loneliness.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have to really feel whatever negative feeling is bothering me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI cant keep using substances, food and other people to help me cope with my loneliness and sadness anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's gonna be days where it feels like every one I know is busy and I have no one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have to be my own best friend those days. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe loneliness passes eventually. It is transmuted into other feelings if you are fully present to it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLearn to feel your feelings fully instead of avoiding them. And I have to remember that I am loved. Even if it feels as if I am utterly alone. I am loved and I matter.
10	I felt an overwhelming desire to offer you advice, till I realised you weren't asking for help or opinions. (Annoying ENFP instincts!)\n\nYou are indeed loved and matter and I'm glad you've found peace with yourself.\n\nThanks for sharing, this will help others :)
3	OP are you able to reconnect with your family?  I have found being around caring and supportive people very important.  Do you go to church?  That is a great way to connect with people.  You've gotta find a way to get yourself \*out there\*.  Put on your shoes and go for a walk.  You're at an age where you will probably meet a boyfriend/girlfriend.  Try not to get discouraged.  Things will turn around for you.  What you are dealing with is temporary.  You have a lot of life left in you.  Try to enjoy the simple things.  The best things in life are free.
3	I am on the same page as you, literally have no one in my new location but myself. I focus on school and my job, plus loving myself. You are not alone in being alone. 
3	I have been working lately on this idea of not fearing any emotion, even loneliness or sadness, but opening myself fully to feel and then as the quote says below =  "I will permit it to pass over me and through me."\n\n&#x200B;\n\n ‚ÄúI must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.‚Äù   \n‚Äï **Frank Herbert,** [**Dune**](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/3634639) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI peeked at your post history.  I'm happy you are doing better.

2	*Smiles*\n\nHow are you? üòÅ
1	yes. I have a depression journal and it helps.
2	Requesting your options	Quick questions:\nWhat kind of things make you guys feel accepted and loved?\nWhat's the thing that makes a place really comfortable to be in?
2	Someone not trying to control me. Letting me be me.
2	when my friends acknowledge i exist, and reassure me (sincerely) that my outgoing personality isn't bothersome. it's something i'm constantly freaking out about but they love me for being *slightly* obnoxious and that makes me feel comfortable and loved. 
1	Letting me be wacky, weird, and a little platonic touching.
1	How do you handle communication with the opposite sex when in a relationship?	Hi there,\n\nINFJ F, 35 here. Met an ENFP man, 35,  on a night out three weeks ago and had a lovely long chat. He then proceeded to find me on Facebook and message me (he did not know my surname and we have no mutual friends, so I don't know how he managed that!), and since then we have seen each other two more times in group settings (but arranged for us to meet, not by chance), and we have been messaging almost every day, sometimes until the wee morning hours... the flirting is very subtle, and mostly we just discuss life and music/films.\n\nI thought this was something beyond the ENFP just being "friendly" - and then I found out that he has a long-term, live-in girlfriend. He hasn't mentioned her to me yet, in all of our conversations, but I know through his friends.\n\nI struggle what to make of this - is this really an ENFP just looking for friendship, or should I start distancing myself?\n\nAny advice would be much appreciated!
6	ENFP here. Idk about anyone else, but everyone I talk to for over a few days will have heard about my boyfriend. 
6	If he has not mentioned her with that much communication he is keeping her secret I think. He likes you, wants to cheat, etc.
3	Red flag! This is shady behavior from any type. ENFPs in particular tend to be more direct, verbal processors and more open about who we are/our lives, in general, than other types. SO it's especially a red flag from an ENFP.\n\nThe subtle flirting seems normal to me. Friendliness being misunderstood as flirting is so common that it's become an ENFP trope.\n\nWhether he's not flirting and you're misunderstanding, or he is flirting and being dishonest, I'd back away! But you could have a direct conversation with him first, if you like, to be sure. It may clarify some things just to bring up his girlfriend to him directly.
3	This does not sound like ENFP friendliness. This guy sounds like a creep. He probably is unhappy in his relationship or whatever and is doing all this behind her back. It is not normal to text people in the middle of the night when you are committed to someone else. I can't even fathom meeting someone and not telling them I'm in a relationship - that's a really important person in my life and I love to talk about them! 
1	Still figuring that out bud. I'm naturally shy when it comes to people I'm interested in. But I chat with anyone if I have no interest. It's weird being an enfp
4	Any MBTI dating apps for iphone?	Just saw a post on here that someone made an Android dating app for MBTI and I want in! Sadly, I'm an iphone user. \n  \nWanna find me an intj üò¢
353	Who remembers these memes from the r/mbti sub?	
27	Mood.
23	People keep saying that ENFPS are a mix of both worlds, as in, they can be open and reserved, and many other things like that. Im an ENFP and I know it is like that,but why? Why are we like that?
14	LOLL i feel attacked
8	Oh lawd. I never knew this was standard. One person told me I was an extroverted introvert once. Then a totally different person told me I was an introverted extrovert. I love meeting people, I love parties, I can chat the hind leg off a donkey. But I also crave being alone sometimes. I went on a hiking trip alone once for five days and camped and carried all my stuff. Loads of people thought that was weird, but it was just something I wanted to do. 
6	Let's give these people stupid ideas, shall we?
3	INFJs get this too. Maybe not as often, but that depends on the person. I mean, I love people . . . in doses haha. It's the Fe.
3	Oh, yas. 
3	Hahahaha
2	My life
1	Why is she acting like this?	Ok all I'm an INTJ and I work with and ENFP and we've always gotten along, we've known each other for about 7 years. We got the feels for each other and I jumped into it a little over a year ago. A month into it she was doing something at work I had to call her out on. She got mad at me and didn't talk to me for a week. I was away for business for that week and when I got back she didn't want to see me and so it went down hill from there. She told me feelings were all one sided from me and that she just went along with it to see where it would go. So I was angry and hurt of course and tried to move on and forget it. She continued to text and snapchat me and even said she couldn't stand that I was mad at her and she couldn't live with herself if I ghosted her. So I told her I wasn't mad but that I was hurt by her being disingenuous. So she would text me every few days and check in and on a few occasions proposition me (we have never been physical) with one time telling me she just couldn't stop thinking about fu\*\*ing me. I just responded that I couldn't which later she made me pay for. So fast forward a year later with flare ups of the relationship between us through that time and we almost hooked up a few times, she backed out once and I backed out the others. She told a mutual friend she had to cut me out of her life because I wouldn't give her what she wanted (I don't know what that means?). So she unfriended me on all social media. This was after she sent me a meme that said, "Trust the overthinker who tells you they love you for they have assuredly thought of every reason not to". I confront her on this because I hadn't told her I loved her in over a year and she said, I just thought that you would like it, it's something you would say. Then she said, that I wanted a future with her and that was something I couldn't have. I never told her I wanted a future with her, I was never able to trust her again. She has been treating me like shit lately, calling me crazy and that I'm not as smart as I think I am. What I do at work is a failure and that other coworkers are talking about me. She did try to apologize but I was so on guard with her I didn't trust it. She is using that glorious Ne / Te on me in an evil way. Normally I'd confront her and discuss it but it always comes back to be treated poorly. Tell me what all of your Ne / Fi tells you about this situation. I have my theories but all my strategies seem to fail. Also I can't ignore her since I work with her. I do care for her I just can't be in a romantic relationship with her also we're not young people, she is in her mid 30's and I'm in my 40's.
2	Just a guess - but one from an intj in my 40s married to an ENFP for 20+ years, so there's that....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe wants you but doesn't "get" you and thinks you're emotionally unavailable, yet is confused and tormented by your complete openness about feelings and life in general.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust clearly and repeatedly tell her that last sentence "I do care for her I just can't be in a romantic relationship with her." and that you just want to be friends but if that is too difficult for her you understand. I think some of that other crap she is pulling is a smoke screen, trying to turn what she feels she is getting from you back toward you. My ENFP is always trying to get me to "feel" whatever she thinks I should be feeling - always convinced I am not feeling enough. She will beat on you just to make you "feel", so be aware of that. Try to communicate about your feelings very very clearly. Act in a completely consistent manner with what you say. She will get the message eventually.
2	ENFP girl here, to me she likes you but struggles with herself and overanalyzes the possible ways to be in a romantic relationship with you, and probably she got deeply hurt several times in the course of your contact for many reasons mainly because she felt you don't share the same feelings for her or didn't try as much as her.  
2	Alright I think I need an outside opinion from people more experienced than I am.	Alright so incoming wall of text, TL;DR at the bottom\n\nSo I don‚Äôt really know where else to go with a post like this so I thought ‚Äúeh- I‚Äôll put it here‚Äù. Anyways on with the story.\n\nThis my friends, is a story about me, a girl, my best friend, and his boyfriend. I‚Äôm a guy who is currently a Junior in High School, the girl is my first love and my first girlfriend, my best friend is well, my best friend, who is also gay. His boyfriend is an INTJ that has very... sociopathic tendencies and has told me that he has been diagnosed with depression, which I do believe. \n\nIn my freshman year, I met my best friend, a sophomore at the time, who also introduced me to the girl. God when I first looked at her I was in love at first sight. But months later I find out that that girl was in love with my best friend, who had been friends with her since the sixth grade. Some of you may know where this is going.\n\nWe‚Äôll call the girl Ashley and my best friend Dave for sakes of privacy.\n\nAshley told Dave her feelings, and, like the person he is, even though he is gay(he was openly gay with his friends and even Ashley), he decided to tell her about my feelings for her as well. We were and still are great friends by the way. Nevertheless, Ashley decided to get us all into a phone call and talk this over. She came to the decision that whoever asked her first would go out with her(Dave acted like he reciprocated her feelings to make her feel better, she had, or at least claimed to have mental issues). \n\nI like the idiot I am, didn‚Äôt say anything.\n\nThe two were in a relationship for a year and a half before I met Dave‚Äôs now boyfriend, Jake. Jake is very openly suicidal and disregards most everything and everyone that tries to help him. A lot of this was caused by his verbally abusive family and home life. \n\nI‚Äôm a stubborn bastard who can‚Äôt help but try and help people, no matter how it ends up, so eventually I broke down his barrier enough that he admitted his feelings for Dave to me and revealed to me that not only was his only reason for living Dave, but that Dave never loved Ashley in the first place.\n\nHe said not to say anything to him but I couldn‚Äôt just stand there and watch both Jake and Dave suffer. I asked Dave if what Jake said about his non existent feelings for Ashley were true.\n\nThey were both pissed but somehow I managed to reason it out and resolved to help Dave overcome his fear of ending the relationship. A few weeks later he did. \n\nTurns out Dave also shared feelings for Jake and I helped them get together in a relationship. Honestly not sure if that was the best idea now but who knows? \n\nThey wanted to help me find love too and I told them about how my feelings for Ashley never faded. The break up ended on good terms between the two and we all collectively agreed- what the hell could go wrong? As you may have guessed...\n\nIt went wrong.\n\nTurns out that not only did Dave not romantically love her because he was gay but also because she was a pathological liar. I didn‚Äôt find this out until a month after I asked her out and she said yes. \n\nThat month was one of the best I‚Äôve ever had. Until one day she sat me down at school and broke up with me. For reasons that weren‚Äôt even true. This was literally a few days after she came to my house for the first time. \n\nSo turns out the girl I loved more than anything didn‚Äôt love me at all. But that‚Äôs not the reason I‚Äôm making this post.\n\nThis post is about Jake. Jake, even after getting the love of his life, still doesn‚Äôt listen to anyone or anything. He still is suicidal, or at least believes he will commit suicide one day, and that Dave doesn‚Äôt really love him. Dave does love him, very much. But sadly the stress of both life, the thought of his future, moving on to college after senior year, and having a depressed, suicidal boyfriend who over analyzes everything is physically hurting him. He gets chest pains. \n\nNot only this, Jake hates me and everything I stand for. So I can‚Äôt even begin to help him. Every time he lets me he seems to take a step forward- but then he takes ten steps back. \n\ntl;dr: my best friend‚Äôs boyfriend is a sucidal, depressed, possible sociopath(still not sure there), who refuses to listen to anyone and everyone and antagonizes everything, is on a spiral downwards something he can‚Äôt crawl back from, and I don‚Äôt know how to help him.\n\nI‚Äôm only 17 and I mostly talk to the guy online, I don‚Äôt know how to help him. If anyone has somewhere I can crosspost this, maybe some advice, anything, please help me. 
3	You could advise Jake to see someone like the school counselor. Sometimes talking to someone who has more life experiences can be really helpful. \n\nAs much as you want to help your best friend it isn't up to you to fix his problems. The decisions he makes are his choice and as much as you would like to make them for him you can't. What you can do though is be there for him through thick and thin. Be the kind of person he can trust when things do get hard. \n\nBut remember, they are his decisions, he has to make them.\n
3	It is is not your job to help him. Or your responsibility. Some people don't want help. Don't let his toxic personality drag you down.\n\nIf you think he is legitimately going to try suicide call the cops.
3	Talk to an adult, one you trust or at least the _one you trust a bit more than others_. You're 17, there are things that (luckily) you haven't lived/seen yet. Even the problem you/he see as the biggest one, can be solved in some way.
2	No one wants to hear whats wrong so, although it cant be fixed, give him a taco.

8	Experiencing depression every time I lack a sense of purpose	Hello all,\n\nThe past year has been really difficult for me in terms of my mental health. Especially since graduating from college, and getting a full time job. I was so excited about my job at first but then I realized it wasn‚Äôt what I was expected and my freedom was severely restricted. Because of that, and because of the fact I stayed in the same city as my undergrad, I felt trapped, leading me to an intense episode of depression.\n\nThe beginning of this year 2019 I finally saw my way out my intense depression, and my anxiety lightened up as well. I think it was because I found this fellowship that I wanted to apply to, and I hyper focused on it and it made me feel I had a sense of purpose I wasn‚Äôt finding in my job. And recently, I had to study for the GRE, and though it was immensely stressful, once again I felt I had immense purpose so I was quite content. I took the test on Saturday, and it was a great relief to be over.\n\nBut this morning, I had this overwhelming sinking feeling in my chest, and I dragged myself out of bed despite my deep sadness. I tried to work through it but I had to take the day off. Does anyone else have issues with needing to be doing something meaningful and their emotional health?\n\nNotes: \n-My job has a contract, I have to finish it to earn my education award, and I have about four more months. \n-I go to therapy and take medication.
5	Yep. 100%. I ended up creating a side hustle in addition to my job until I was able to quit and take it full time. I love the freedom that I have now and the creativity it allows me!
2	Yes, for sure. And many have the same issue. Some will just express it differently.\n\n&#x200B;
1	Drop everything and become a hobo! That's what I did. Crazy Lester only got my beans twice this week!
1	 I find a change of pace to be a good way out of the depression feeling, I know its hard, but you‚Äôre just at the beginning of your career, probably in an adjustments phase. Finding something outside of work to give you a sense of purpose is a great place to start. I personally got into running and gave myself small achievable goals that would set my mind straight with determination. I‚Äôm a very lazy person so training my discipline skills helped a lot, focusing my mind helped a lot. Especially for enfp types that have a forever running creative brain running a mile a minute. All the best to you, op.

21	Does anyone else fall into a shame spiral at the smallest of things?	I think since I find socialising and chatting to new people so easy 99% of the time, when it goes wrong/is awkward it takes me literal DAYS to get over it. \n\nI just had an awkward interaction with my boss (in French, called her ‚Äòtu‚Äô instead of ‚Äòvous‚Äô - it is relatively impolite but not the hugest of deals) and I literally muttered ‚Äòi want to die and jump into a vat of acid‚Äô to myself directly afterwards. I predict it will take two or three days for me to not dread running into her. \n\nHow do i stop spinning out about tiny, irrelevant things?
5	You ask why it really matters, ask if it's ever happened that every other human has goofed up, then ask if the person you goofed up in front of has likely ever goofed up too and will understand and also likely isn't event that bothered by since she/he is aware that you're foreign to his/her language, then say fuck it and then move on with your life at peace with yourself.
7	I had a habit of this. Then I would apologise too much, which becomes annoying to the other person, and I was putting the onus on them to make me feel better, which was not their job when I was the one who made the mistake. So now I make a firm point of apologising once, sincerely, but without excuse, then keeping my over active brain to myself. Something like, "I'm sorry, I really put my foot in my mouth there. That was thoughtless of me." I don't expect a reply from them. Then talk about something else. 
3	Yes. One thing I learned was to count to 10 in my head and then just forget about it, because I was probably putting way more thought into it than the other person was.\n\nMistakes happen :)
2	I do that too. It helps me to think about the fact that other ppl don't think about me as much as i think they do!
2	Not an ENFP, but with me some things do not bother me, and some things the littlest things can start a shame spiral.   Turns out it is a common co-existing condition with ADHD.   Blah, blah, blah brain stuff where one doctor names it Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria, though it is really something to do with a brain region called the anterior cingulate cortex and how well this ACC region is talking to other brain areas and when it talks to other brain areas.  (I bring up the ACC for it is not unique to ADHD for a couple other disorders have problems with this not just ADHD.)
2	If I was ever told off at school, I would sit and sulk about it for the rest of the day even if it was a tiny thing lol
2	Is it because you think they are judging you? Or because you are judging yourself. Either way you are human. Perfection is impossible and boring. Be yourself. And here is a good lesson to learn. You mostly think about yourself right? How you come off? What you're saying and doing, thinking and feeling? So is everyone else. No one is paying much attention to anyone else and certainly not remembering things like that long or caring.
2	i'm not going to lie but there are things i've done from a year ago that i still just spiral about for days  \na fun coping mechanism (which i never really seem to be able to use effectively, but it is good): knowing that the person you talked to probably won't remember what happened, and that they don't think less of you for having slip of the tongue (or anything along those lines)\*\n\n^(\*this seems to be re-occuring advice oops)
1	I used to.\n\nImagine the story as if you very best friend was telling it to you. If your friend was like "OMG i totally embarrassed myself I used 'tu' instead of 'vous' with my boss!!!" you'd probably say it's ok, it was just a little mistake and you still love them. Then apply that love and understanding to yourself.  \n\nNext, "what's worst case scenario?" where I imagine what is literally the worst worst worst thing that could happen. Your boss fires you, all your friends turn on you, and you lose your home etc. Normally the worst case for me always ends with me having to move in with my mom. I assume my mom is going to continue to love me & I could rebuild my life. After my dad died I did live with my mom for a month and basically restarted my life it was actually great. Obviously you should make this personal for you. One time I imagined I would run into my ex at a coffee shop and physically attacked him and tore his guts out and smashed his bass on a car. Here I felt like I was anxious and actually I was violently angry. Another version of this is "what if i lost control right now" i use it on occasions like when I'm in line at the supermarket and imagine running out of the store or punching everyone in the face.  I find a lot of comfort in imagining these ridiculous scenarios though, because I get to carry out and acknowledge all the feelings I'm having in a safe way. \n\nThen, "best case scenario" which is when you make up a story about what could go right. Maybe using the informal term makes your boss see you differently and she decided she likes you so much that you get promoted and you become in expert in your field etc.  I have a post it I keep on my fridge that says "What if it all works out?" Whenever I'm stressed and see it it helps me remember that mistakes are just a bump in the road not a life altering problem. \n\nThe tool I use for my big anxieties is "the time machine." I imagine if I had a time machine that could only take 3 trips is this problem big enough that I would use it to go back to fix it? Calling your boss the casual term vs formal is not a life altering moment. I would assume you would not use your limited time travels to fix that.\n
2	Differences between ENFP/J?	When I first took the 16personalities test, I came out as ENFJ, but when I took it a few years later I came out as ENFP. Both times were very borderline and I‚Äôm just not sure which I should go with. Any tips for differentiating between the two? Have any of you dealt with this?
3	ENFJs lead with Fe-Ni, while ENFPs lead with Ne-Fi.\n\nIt means ENFJs think about people and then wonder how it affects them in the long run.\n\nWhile ENFPs think about how stuff change, and then wonder how they feel about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr in other words:\n\nENFJs -> think about people in the present -> then think about the self and them in the future.\n\nENFPs -> think about stuff in the future -> then think about the self in the present.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe types are pretty different.
3	They have completely different functions as has  been said. ENFP is Ne-Fi-te-Si, ENFJ is Fe-Ni-Se-Ti.\n\nCheck this out: https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/if-youre-confused-about-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-read-this-an-intro-to-cognitive-functions/\n\nThen this: https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/12/how-each-cognitive-function-manifests-based-on-its-position-in-your-stacking/\n\nThen this: https://www.typeinmind.com/nefi/ and this https://www.typeinmind.com/feni/\n
2	Huge differences! Don't be fooled by the fact that they are only one letter off -- these two have all different cognitive functions, so don't try to just pinpoint the stereotypical difference between "P" and "J". No one is "in between" two different types. Especially not two types with all different functions!\n\nENFP's and ENFJ's share some characteristics. They are both spontaneous, enthusiastic, kind and flexible, they have lots of friends, energy, but they share no cognitive functions, so it's literally not possible to be both.\n\nENFJ's, are; they go along with what others want because they want to please others. ENFP's, on the other hand, go along to keep the peace, but under the surface they resent it.\n\nWhich do you understand better: your own feelings or the feelings of others?  ENFJ's have big feelings, but they are often at a loss to understand them because they are so focused on the feelings of others. Because of this they are social chameleons and do not like to move outside of social norms. ENFP's, on the other hand, understand their own feelings well. ENFP's can appear egocentric: they tend to judge everything based on their own values. Even as a very empathetic ENFP I understand my own feelings without thought, but need to stretch myself to feel what others are feeling. \n\nI've had close relationships with two ENFJs my perception is they are always worried about making everyone happy and can lose themselves in this task. They can put their own values aside to make other people comfortable. Which is something that is very hard for an ENFP to do, even when we are being nice we still feel the need to state our disagreement. My ex was an ENFJ and his malleable personality was very frustrating to me. Basically an ENFJ is a yes man and a party planner all rolled into one. An ENFP is more likely to do things their own way even though they wanna be friends with everyone while they do it. 
2	I think ENFJ's appear more stable than ENFP's. although they are very similar, ENFJ's are more organized and decided, whereas ENFP's are all over the place. ENFJ's tend not to be too shy about their feelings, whereas ENFP's keep their true feelings close. ENFJ's are the more extroverted of the two types, whereas ENFP's really desire time alone to reconnect with Fi. ENFJ's also tend to be more natural leaders, although ENFP's definitely have a capacity for leadership as well. ENFJ's are usually a bit more conforming as well, whereas ENFP's want to be different and original.\n\nI once read a post about how these two types experience love as well:\n\nfor an ENFJ, because of Fe, emotional connection, understanding of needs, feeling safe, and acceptance of imperfections is important\n\nfor an ENFP, because of Fi, we ask if they think we're being real with them, know that they trust our motives, want support no matter what, want them to have our back, and want them to give us space to be ourselves.\n\nMy moms an ENFJ, and we have definitely had our fair share of misunderstandings, most of them around the Fe/Fi difference. In general I'd say ENFP's are usually more independent and spontaneous and despise being micromanaged or controlled in any way, whereas ENFJ's are usually able to look to a person's intentions (although ENFP's are very good at doing this too, as are all NF's. It's just that we are typically a bit more annoyed with well meaning but slightly controlling advice or suggestions, although I think many will try to listen, especially because we like to try to stay open minded)
2	Does your employer utilize MBTI?	Everyone I work with is required to take an MBTI assessment. We have workshops twice a year to discuss things like working style, communication and conflict. I'd never heard of an employer requiring staff to take MBTI assessment before I worked here. I'm curious... is this a common thing in the workplace? If so, how else is it used in a professional setting?
1	What companies are these? Sounds like they have some what of a revolutionary idea. Know your skills and talents in your employees and utilize it
1	Jet's MBTI - Cast Podcast	Hey Reddit, my name is jetplane48 (ESTP 7w8 sx/sp) and I am starting up a podcast in relation to MBTI. Fundamentally, the goal of the podcast is to educate the viewers of several Typology systems through a series of one-on-one's with others who are interested in the same topics. I have been conducting interviews for many years (MBTI related) and this is just an extension of that, however, I want to discuss topics that the audience wants me to cover. Naturally, I'll come up with my own material but I would love to explore topics that others have in mind. I am busy with school for the next few months but when I finish, the goal is to eventually be more consistent with these podcast uploads if this turns out to be popular enough. I'm very excited to get this started, and let's see some questions!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg)\n\n&#x200B;
2	My Shaman the ENFP	(I'm writing this because I want to share and celebrate what a truly developed example of our type is like. The world as it is -- capitalistic, competition-driven and patriarchal -- is hard on our type. What does it look like for ENFPs to achieve success,  gain leadership and still be ourselves? I would love it if others shared examples of other ENFPs they look up to.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe studied engineering, but became a musician. He came to America from his native Argentina but fell in love with the Russian language and people. He was cherished and loved by his friends and people came to him instinctively for advice, but he did not find his calling until he found Ayahuasca and became a shaman. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll the dots became connected. He conducted ayahuasca ceremonies in the US, Argentina and Russia (in Russian), building up a fanatical following. People came to him as seekers looking for truth, or sufferers looking to be healed. I have seen it again and again, how he always find exactly the right words to say to people, even when they are in the thick of it, freaking out, or holding in the pain so tightly there does not seem to be an opening to let any love in. He can take care of a group of 25-35 people and make each one feel loved and understood. Always spontaneous, and yet always appropriate. His ceremonies change lives and people come back again and again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was watching him lead a dynamic meditation this weekend. To the music he lead the people to fling their arms rhythmically towards the center of the room while saying "Zwoosh". In the beginning the women were more into it and it was like a dance of temple goddesses. Then the men became more into it ("WOOSH") and as they became less timid the goddesses fell out and gave them the floor. Throughout it all, the shaman held his movement constant...as graceful as the women, as strong as the men. Indeed men and women alike feel equally, completely able to open up to him. From the Texan bro whose body and spirits have been broken by competitive sports to the woman racked by shame and sexual trauma. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is no trace of authoritarianism about him at all, but he has attracted a team to follow him who all instinctively just want to support his work. He leads by cultivating their growth and encouraging them to use their own superpowers. Sometimes, things are not always the most organized in the details. But the important things always go right. When I leave the weekend, I feel like my soul has just left the laundry. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs an ENFP whose path to success and stability have been to aggressively cultivate my inferior functions so I can lead a life of routine and rigor, it's really beautiful to see another who have actualized themselves and is serving others by being themselves so completely. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	Nice story, I have two doubts:\n\n- how are you sure he‚Äôs ENFP rather than another type (asking out of curiosity, I don‚Äôt have the necessary skills to say anything about it)\n- as an ENFP, I find difficult to embrace cults, gurus or even political parties. This doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt have strong political views, just that I don‚Äôt fit into too much like-minded groups, my individuality suffers too much.
104	Ever feel bad when you see people straight up ignoring a person flyering that you go a little out of your way to take a flyer?	LOL I run into this all the time...I just feel bad people know they‚Äôre there but just ignore them
22	No. It's a waste of paper. I'm always polite and say "no thanks!" when approached though. 
21	Yes, I have that kind of feeling when I see something unjust.\nI think my peak was when I saved a dog from a group of other dogs that were attacking him. I stopped my car and I tried to _explain_ to the dogs that they were cowards. I think I risked a lot (and it was kinda stupid in several ways), but that was my feeling in that moment.
3	Kinda ish
3	No I never take them :o If they approach or I accidentally make eye contact I smile and say no thank you, but if I can feasibly pretend I didn't hear them I do.
3	One time someone came to my door trying to get people to sign up for one of those recipe ingredient delivery set ups..\n\nI had the day off and wasn‚Äôt in any hurry, so I let him give me the spiel and was really friendly to him for a solid while. \n\nI didn‚Äôt sign up, but he didn‚Äôt mind- I like to think I recharged his batteries for more cold knocking!
2	I always do this I'm an idiot
1	I've done that work so I know what it feels like. I seldom buy something from someone, but I just like talking to them :)
1	I almost always do! Because I know some of these people can‚Äôt go home until they hand out everything (flyer, newspaper, etc). Lots of companies also give out things like gift cards so free $. Also, I can always recycle the paper. 
1	Yes and with food samples
1	I don't go out of my way for them. But if I'm passing them, then I'll take it. I've been on the other end and appreciated people who weren't overly rude about it.
1	Nope. Not me. Sorry they have a bummer of a job, but I dont like any sort of pressure sales crap. 
6	I don't get along well with other Enfp's.	It's not like that I don't like them or that they don't like me but it's rather that anything that comes out of there mouth registers to me as either as annoying/hippie/or there is so much commonality that there's essentially nothing new to learn. I especially don't communicate well with the loud and overwhelming ones since I'm loud and overwhelming too so it's an energetic imbalance. I somehow have no problems with infp's though. How do you, my fellow enfp's fare with other Enfp's? 
6	Sounds like a classic bit of self hatred. You see people similar to you and you dislike them for reasons you dislike yourself. 
2	I do great with other ENFP's but often clash a lot with them too. But we're so open about it that it's easily resolved. One of my best friends is ENFP. 
2	My best friend is an ENFP and we go full retard together on the daily 
1	My girlfriend is an ENFP and we both get along great despite being both ENFPs. However, when I make friends with other ENFPs, I do notice that our friendship is either short term or I plain just don't see them often at all. It's kind of weird, I do like other ENFPs, especially when they're a different Enneagram type as me. 
1	ENFP navigating ISTP Ex	So I‚Äôm in the middle of a divorce with ISTP. Share a kiddo so unfortunately will need to stay connected for a while. He wants divorce and is moving in with another woman (that he hooked up with after divorce talk supposedly). Trying to figure out how to protect myself emotionally. He still is doing things for me (so he cares) and wants to keep what he calls a ‚Äúconnection‚Äù (that involves sex, of course). I did some pretty crappy things during marriage and him too. Living under same roof and so hard to have boundaries. Help?! Advice?
2	[deleted]
1	There were reasons for yours break-up (list them in writing, look at them!) so if you are on a divorce stage, well, nothing probably will change: it is beyong fixing. Probably, you tried. It is ok to fail. It is not the end of the world. Let it go: no sex, no emotional involment, no regrets. It is in the past. And you are up for a new adventure.  Even though there were good times, they are better to remain OLD times. New ones are coming! And waiting!\n\nIt will be fine with time (duh!), just let it heal. Better distance (at least emotionally) for a while, avoid each other as much as possible before the move out. Try different schedules, spend alone time out in movies, cafe, get busy with classes (learn new language), work late, be busy, and do not get involved in long personal talks. It is not the time. It is too early and too painful. Maybe later. It is easier to get over the person if you first take them  out from your everyday routine, and afterwards out of mind.\n\nAnd do not blame yourself about crappy things. It is ok to do mistakes. Even bad ones. We all do.
6	How ENFPs Can Practice Using Introverted Sensing (Cringe Worthy Painful Methods)	
19	Do you have "placeholder" people?	I noticed this tendency in me of having a person that fullfills an emotional role in my life. It doesn¬¥t matter who this person is, they¬¥re just filling up a role. In my case, as I¬¥m single and bored, I use guys to be the "boyfriend placeholders". I know for sure they don¬¥t care about me, and, as I said, I can¬¥t care about them because why risk it? They will leave anytime. I¬¥ll just go out and find another person to be the placeholder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess I want to be read as edgy but this is plain sad lol\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, does this happen to any of you?
10	I do this too.\n\nI know I'm too broken to have an actual relationship with but men are nevertheless attracted to me because I'm young and hot.\n\nI know they'll fuck off eventually when they get a taste of what they're really in for or get their nut, so I just juggle 2-4 guys at a time for conversation and attention. When one fucks off I cycle in a new one.
5	This reminds me of a guy I worked with who seems pretty ENXP. He had a very busy job but no time for socialising, and kind of over shared with his colleagues instead...I reached out  since he was venting a lot and seemed in a bad place but he rejected my offer, possibly cos he had grown too attached and wanted to avoid being needy. Now he wants no contact? It's frustrating but I'm learning to be less in my head and let it go. I'm INFP. 
4	Guys tend to be attracted to me even though I don't flirt, probably cos I listen to problems and talk about my own pretty freely with friends I feel comfortable with. (INFP) 
3	I used to. It's definitely a way to protect yourself but also a pathway to feeling isolated. I decided it was just better to be real and sometimes get hurt. Atleast then I was true to myself. 
2	Motivational Monday!	\nToday is a new day! A fresh week! An opportunity start something new and get back into life. \n\nWhat inspires you, /r/ENFP?\n\nPost stories, quotes, and images that give you life. Need a little rally? Don't be shy posting your goals; let /r/ENFP give you a pep talk!\n
3	‚ÄúI don‚Äôt totally know where I‚Äôm going, but that‚Äôs never stopped me before.‚Äù - A. J. Kurtz \n\nHope you all have a productive and awesome week! üíì
5	ENFP Sent me this. Draw and it'll tell you what you really want!	
4	Well...its not, not wrong? Lmfao this is great sent link to everyone I like. Doubt they'll open it because they are always nervous when I send stuff
2	Lol
2	Whatever I draw, it becomes a penis. Maybe that's the reason the site is called **peni**int\n\n(btw, I istintively drawn a penis anyway at first glance, it just became a little better after auto-morphing)
55	Tried 4AcoDMT for the first time and felt super inspired to paint.	
13	My friend and I were looking through old photographs I had and I found one of driftwood that had recently washed up on a beach in CA. I thought about how it grew into a tree fitting in with the forest and eventually a human or a storm or something cut it down and somehow it ended up in the ocean. It floated around for God knows how long until it washed up on shore one day and finally somebody noticed it.\n\nI showed my friend and he studied it for a while then he said "it's strange how so many thoughts never become words." It's so simple and painfully obvious and I felt like painting exactly that. 
3	omg this is amazing!!
3	Super creative//very beautiful! 
2	this is what my brain feels like when I'm trying to sleep
2	Ah good ole 4acodmt... the only time I took it was back when I was 17, me and my gf had the best sex of our lives !!!
1	Fight Club reference ?? I dig!
1	Defiantly something there.
1	never get tired of looking :D
6	ENFPs in Science	Hey guys - was wondering if any of you have careers in the science field and how you like it.  I'm currently studying chemistry and love working in labs.  It's my absolute love. and passion.  However, I'm a little concerned about being left in a lab by myself for hours at a time as far as a job.  (Not in the sense that I'd be afraid of blowing myself up, but just tend to get lonely without other people to talk to.)  Obviously in classes there are tons of other students around and it's very energizing to me, but I imagine it's a little different in the professional world.  I wish I could be able to be alone for longer periods of time, but I find myself getting a little depressed honestly when left alone for hours in silence, especially if it's day after day.  I've come to accept that that's just how I am and I can't make myself be different.  I think I would love it if I could do something in this field where I got to work with a close team.  A couple people have suggested I be a chemical engineer instead of a research scientist.  Thoughts from any of you who work in the hard sciences?  
2	I'm a clinical laboratory scientist and I really enjoy it. Also an ENFP. Depending on the shift, you'd always be working with at least one to three people in the same department, so it's not too lonely. 
1	Learning it on you own is super hard, let me tell you this coming from the physics department :) Have enough people around you and you'll be fine and can do anything. I went into Engineering and it is actually super rewarding.
1	I am in the same boat as you, I'm in physics and environmental sciences... I don't like bench work much but in every lab I've worked in, there's usually been people around. In one lab my boss told my friends not to talk to me so I'd focus on the chemistry and in that case I listened to podcasts and audiobooks which was better than the silence. \n\n&#x200B;
1	I recently finished a master's in soil ecology, so research biology-esq, and found it to be really isolating. You do get to work with a team and obviously there can be more collaboration depending on what department and lab you're in but in my opinion the core of research is a very individual experience. There are bringing pieces together and inspiring talks throughout the process but ultimately it's up to one person to do the bulk of the work and I found that to not be ideal. I realized I would rather work in communicating research. 
4	Curiousity	I don't know why I felt like sharing this but here goes:\n\nI've been going for a walk on Sunday afternoons because I get a bit bummed out around then. I usually just walk for abour an hour, listening to music with my phone's data off so no one bothers me.\n\nAnyway, there's this person walking along way ahead of me, and they have such an energetic walking style that it catches my attention. They're so far away though that I can't even make out any other details, so I have no idea if they were male or female, old or young, whatever. \n\nThen suddenly, like a switch in my brain, I'm overcome with this feeling of YOU HAVE TO MEET THIS PERSON. It was like it was the most important thing in the world, just out of nowhere! Just because of the way they were walking.\n\nI'm no stalker, and even if I caught up with them, it wasn't the right situation to really start a conversation with them anyway, so I just carried along behind them, the way I was going in the first place. They were ahead of me for two more streets before we went separate ways, never to see them again, but my head was buzzing with theories of meeting this person all afternoon.\n\nI'm not really sure what I'm looking for, I've always been curious about people and I know it's an ENFP trait. I know it was a weird thing to happen but I was wondering if anyone could relate?\n\n(Probably didn't help that for the entire walk I was daydreaming about my neighbour who I'm crushing on after a single conversation)
4	You should approach that person just in case it turns out to be me ;)
2	Interesting, yeah that‚Äôs a tricky situation to approach someone. Especially if it‚Äôs a girl, they may feel threatened with someone walking behind them (as I would). I feel that way too sometimes, if someone seems so interesting or alluring 
15	Anyone else messy organized and not so much into fashion trends?	Like my planner looks messy but I know where to find everything and it works for me so I get things done. Like I‚Äôm all about efficiency and less about making things look pretty. Like I try to clean up after myself and put things in the right place.. but I care less about decorating as I have other more important priorities. Same with fashion, I like simple and beautiful and like to do the same thing (skin routine, makeup routine, clothes, etc.) that works. I‚Äôm not always going to be looking for other routines (like buying different makeup foundations) if the one I‚Äôm using already works great. anyone else messy organized and not so into fashion trends?
6	‚ÄúLike my planner...‚Äù - you lost me right there, friend :). But to answer your question, I like fashion - but am also perfectly comfortable plowing around in public wearing whatever Ive worn to bed for the past two nights. It just depends. On nothing in particular.\n\nEdit: and for decoration, no. I dont like to do seasonal/holiday decorations. It seems contrived and fake to me. Ymmv. \n\nDouble bonus edit! And yeah, Im messy. 
3	I'm messy,  I have a bullet journal covered in doodles to trick me into using it, I love to follow fashion but never go shopping for myself, and I don't mind decor but can't be bothered to overhaul things to look like pinterest.
2	Probably my number one catch phrase is "Good Enough" and that's my philosophy with pretty much everything. \n\nAlthough, I do get bursts of inspiration and clean/organize like everything. Then get bored, disinterested, and lazy and leave a mess until I get that burst of annoyance energy.. The "ok I can't live like this anymore" feeling haha.\n\nFashionwise, I am so chill I'd say my style is comfort.. leggings, long shirts, tank tops, shorts anything comfortable. I have never been into trends and honestly this 90s insurgency bothers me a ton for some reason haha. \n\nFor beauty, the only thing I care about is skin care; cleansers, scrubs, moisturisers. I think i just really love soft things and it bothers me if im not soft. The only time I wear make up is for special occasions, and when I do it's typically only eyeliner and mascara.\n\nI do love to organize though.. I think that's the function over beauty haha. \n\nAs for decorating, I do love to be creative and making a space pretty and effective but all my things are pretty basic and I don't have the time, money, and effort to make it better so, ha, it's good enough.\n\nI do LOVE sims though I pretty much live my ideal life on there and then ignore real life haha.
2	I am very stylish. I know what looks good and what colors look good together, etc. I make my own trends.
1	I‚Äôm sort of similar, I do enjoy an aesthetic to things though, a little glamor. I definitely fit the messy organized type, I love efficiency but sometimes (often times) things stack up.
1	I'd bet 50% of people here agreeing are actually mistyped ESFPs but eh, how should I know...
1	My organizational skills are... lacking to say the least. It‚Äôs something I have to work one considering the field I plan on going into (high school band director, probably in Texas which makes it a whole other beast). \n\nFashion is weird for me. In the winter, I wear almost exclusively a flannel, t-shirt, and jeans with tennis shoes and maybe a jacket or hoody if it‚Äôs extra cold. It‚Äôs purely a comfort and convenience move (too warm inside? Take off my flannel and have it fit handily into my backpack). In the warmer seasons, I definitely have more of a fashion sense, I have a handful of short sleeve almost Hawaiian button-ups with different designs. Along with that, I usually will wear khaki shorts of different colors with sparry‚Äôs or some other nicer shoe brand. Why I vary in the different seasons, I don‚Äôt know. 
96	Not necessarily an ENFP thing, but thought ya‚Äôll would be entertained	I bought a pineapple from the grocery store today, and when I took it out of the grocery bag, it pricked my hand. Then I imagined how hard life would be for a pineapple if it was alive because it would prick someone every time it tried to hug them. And then I felt so bad I started hugging it and was holding it like a baby like, it‚Äôs ok little one, I still love you. I started thinking of it as a sentient being, but then realized tomorrow I was going to have to cut it open; and the thought of doing that to my living pineapple baby made my stomach churn. And that‚Äôs how I ended up on my kitchen floor cradling a pineapple in tears. 
25	That‚Äôs hilarious üòÇ. Hope you feel better now.  
19	Pineapple guts on my pizza with some ham is delicious.
18	Random fact: pineapple juice contains an enzyme that dissolves human flesh, which is why it starts to hurt your mouth after you eat a lot of it in a short period of time
13	Lol this is this best thing I have read all day!!!
10	Don‚Äôt watch Sausage Party! 
7	And that's how the pineapples rights movement started...
7	....Are you okay?
6	This is so funny OMG hahahah. I remember when I was young, whenever my classmates hit the desk with their hand heavily, I cried a little inside, since I thought the desk would hurt so much but they couldn‚Äôt do anything haha
5	Hahaha this story isnt very strange or out of the world.
5	So did you still cut it open? I like to think that foods want to be eaten cause otherwise they would be thrown away without doing anything useful with their life
3	I think this is goes along with that\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Icx7hBWeULM
3	... yep and here you can see the typical ENFP overthinking 
3	Technically, it‚Äôs not ‚Äúliving‚Äù anymore, since it‚Äôs been cut off its roots. I guess you can have comfort in that, so go ahead and eat it?\n\nBut it is a hilarious post. üòÇ
6	Have you considered that the pineapple might be prickly because it doesn't *want* to be hugged?\n\nMaybe it just wants to be left alone...
2	LmaoüòÇüòÇüòÇ made my day üòÇ‚ù§
2	that is literally the cutest story about overcoming hedgehog dilemma I ever read <3
2	I once cried during homework over leakage current because the electrons get separated from the ion stream and I thought they must be soooooo lonely....you get me.
2	Okay so think about it like this: it's that pineapple's DESTINY to be eaten! The plant it came from made it special just to be consumed so that it's seeds could be spread. Don't let its life go to waste by not eating it! And don't feel guilty! If it could say one sentence to you, it would probably say: "please eat me sweet enfp"
2	Continuing in fruit stories: I had like 30 minutes hard laugh on Friday because I found straight banana, like it didnt have the curve lol. It was sooo hilarious my colleagues at work thought Im on something.
5	Anyone else get anxiety while eating in front of people?	It‚Äôs so weird and this only happens when I‚Äôm either the only one eating or when it‚Äôs just be one-on-one with someone else. (Unless it‚Äôs with a close friend, then I‚Äôm fine). Like, one time I had lunch with a speaker at summer camp to ask him some questions and literally took two bites from my meal. I got anxious thinking about somehow messing up eating a burger and then I got anxious because he could see I wasn‚Äôt eating.\n\nAnd on my first date (with someone I was pretty comfortable around already but still) I went into overdrive omg. I was literally overthinking how often I was sipping my water in between taking bites of my sandwich.\n\nIdk, is this just an ENFP thing or is this just me?
3	On the contrary, I feel nervous at times but more relaxed while eating. I guess I relax when I'm doing something. Also I feel like a boss when I'm eating an apple confidently in front of a group of intimidating strangers...\n\nI guess we're both weird in our own way :-))
3	Overthinking is definitely ENFPish like Hahah!! I love you.\n\nYes, this can happen. Why? well let's see, you're the only one who is eating, and maybe to you eating is something you like to do and look at, so you assume everyone is like that. so if you're the only one who is eating, then you will assume there is more attention being paid to you. And from here and out, if you do anything that you define is "weird" or unique to you, then you will feel like people are paying even more and more attention to you, judging you. But the only judge here, is you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust be aware of it, and if you find a judgemental thought, just play with it. You can exaggerate your behavior to see if you will get a reaction from anybody, to confirm if your self-judgement has any basis. But remember, whether people are judging you in their heads, or not. It doesn't matter. Let them judge you, who cares? Your happiness is not depended on that, neither is your mood. Unless you let it. And if so? If you do let this get to you, well, you can ask yourself, what are you trying to learn? Remember you will learn whatever it is you are trying to learn, if you remain light about it, nothing is worth stressing about, the things that are worth stressing about, you will never see coming. So. The moment you catch yourself becoming uptight, having a contraction inside of you. Notice it, and be in it, and let yourself expand. 
2	Yeah, especially if it's something sloppy like spaghetti. But then I'm like ah fuck it they're not paying attention to what I'm doing. 
1	I cover my mouth when I eat.
20	I asked this enfp girl out on a date? Any advice so I don't mess this up? Because I really like her.	So me (m|intj|19) have this huuuuge crush on this enfp girl, I asked her out, and I'm really nervous, because I want it to go well. I really care about her. She's enfp by the way. Any advice on how to not fuck this up???
33	Be interesting and awkward and have some weird shit in mind to talk about. Play hard-to-get a little. Don‚Äôt be a puppy dog. Be decisive but not aggressive. Be confident and funny. Have fun! 
14	INTJs are wonderful listeners and can ask the most thought provoking questions, use that to your advantage. \n\nBe open to not having things go as planned but enjoy the adventure, because being and ENFP is a grand adventure. \n\nMost of all, be honest and be yourself!!!
12	Just be yourself. We‚Äôre good at seeing through bullshit. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask really weird questions we usually love talking about ourselves and love wacky ideas 
9	A pretty sure but also a bit manipulative (?) Way to get an enfp interested is to show them you like them with hints but then act like a normal friend again. Best with  kinda surprising hints which catches the enfp offguard. I think intjs are pretty good with that? My current boyfriend  is one too and he kinda often did that to me before we got together. (Example: we were talking on a party about what he finds most fascinating @ looks about people he likes. And he told me its the eyes and then i started joking and he went with it and started making  fun of me wearing glasses and i was like: hey!! I have nice eyes ok! And he just smiled and said: " yeah they really are beautiful". I was totally in that playful joking mode and ready for playful insults but this caught me pretty much offguard and i didnt know what to answer. )\nGoal of it is to get the enfp thinking  of the meaning of your behavior, which  also makes her think about relationship scenarios with  you. Also be confident about  your feelings!! Dont be afraid to show them.\n\n The thing to know about enfps (or maybe iam just  speaking for myself here üòÖ) is that they are hard to get into a relationship because we constantly think of scenarios and have trouble deciding and keep doubting. But once we are in we really are with all heart.\n\nI hope  it all goes well for the two of you! Intj-enfp relationships are really rewarding! üòä‚ù§
6	Don‚Äôt be scared to be sarcastic or have sass, we love that ;) 
4	Ask her questions. Be curious. Like actually curious. Find out who she is, what she believes in, what she has been through, and where she is from, etc. Don't do little small talk, do big talk. Don't be afraid to broach bigger subjects, we love that and hate small talk. Ask her what her dreams are.
5	Don‚Äôt be fake. We can totally see through that and hate the inauthenticity. I remember my first date with an INTJ and he was doing chivalrous stuff (like, holding doors open for me, paying for stuff, telling me I looked nice) but it wasn‚Äôt genuine and that was really off-putting for me. Like, I was literally wearing the same outfit I wore almost every day! (Jeans and a aeropostal t-shirt lmao). While I do appreciate the whole chivalry thing, the person has to be doing it because they WANT to, not because they feel like they HAVE to. Otherwise the it‚Äôll feel too fake.\n\nI say just be yourself! INTJs are a great match for ENFPs. Don‚Äôt try to do anything you wouldn‚Äôt normally do or things you don‚Äôt actually want to do. Just be genuine and show her that you like her by doing/saying things you GENUINELY want to do/say. Good luck!
3	I would say, make an effort to ask questions and practice reflective listening skills (you can Google it for tips). If she confides a problem or struggle in her life, try to show support by saying "That sounds hard" or something similar - instead of giving advice or problem solving. The main thing is to make an effort to keep the conversation going, as I've gone out with some INTJs where trying to make conversation is like trying to get water out of a rock. Silences are fine once I know someone really well and feel very comfortable with them, but lots of silences are awkward with someone I'm not very familiar with. 
3	Have more fun than she does so she wants to stick around (Edit: Make her want to tap into your positivity). If you are going to a club or a pub, don't stay glued to her, let her talk to other people and do so yourself. Be smart and witty. Don't catch feelings yet. Kissing on the first date is meh since a lot of women's advice books tell women not to let men do that, so go for it on the second one unless you are sure it'll work out. Stay playful.
2	Hang out to the place that you already know or familiar with, but you won‚Äôt run into the people you know.  So you can be more comfortable and don‚Äôt need to worried about how to go there and what to do etc. and ....ahhh try to get yourself off before you go out with her, really, you will be a least a bit calmer 
2	Be honest with her and be yourself because she will see right through any BS.
2	Think of her as the little friend that you want to gently tease now and then, it will make you both feel at ease, and she would unconsciously feel like being looked after :P.\n\nNotice things she says, especially personal things. If she jokes about it, it's probably something burdening her but she doesn't want to overshare or come off as overly emotional, so she makes fun of it. Try to ask further questions instead of backing off because you are afraid of awkwardness (we won't think it's awkward! We thrive on being vulnerable lol it's our weakness). If you can catch her off guard, it's awesome. ;)\n\nAnyway, be as genuine as possible. She probably doesn't want to be impressed by some superficial things, so don't try. She will want to be heard and recognized for who she is, and will want to get to know who you actually are as well. Let her know about you.\n\nHave fun also!
2	Date update??? How did it go?? 
3	Do I (ISTP) still have a chance with my ex (ENFP)?	Long story short, I made a terrible mistake. I lived with her for 3 years while she waited for me to get better, taking care of me and being there for me for the most parts. In that 3 years we‚Äôve had a couple of tug of wars where both of us would do something wrong to the other. Eventually I told her we‚Äôre done, but she wanted to be with me until she can make me better and hoped that I would finally love her again.\n\nFast forward to late last year, I met a girl. Things between my ENFP and I have been pretty stable. We loved each others company and always had been excited to come home to each other. Until I met this girl (ENFJ). She knew about this girl eventually and we‚Äôve had a ton of fights like we haven‚Äôt before. I thought she was my escape and I realised that I can love again. But then I realised I still fucking love my ENFP. Little did I know, was that it was only borrowed love.\n\nAt this point, I‚Äôm all alone yet again. Fell down a deeper rut than when I met my ENFP. She found a rebound (ESFP) but she really likes the guy even though she‚Äôs told me there‚Äôs a lot of things she don‚Äôt like about him. I kept fucking it up and pushing her away unintentionally to the point she legit lost feelings for me overnight. Shes out partying and drinking almost every night with her new friends.\n\nWe are still in talking terms right now but I felt like I cannot ghost her for the fear that she will forget me and wont reconnect. Of course I‚Äôm not exactly in her priority contact list anymore. I want to do what she did for me even though it hurts so bad. She was my best friend and roommate for 2 years while we weren‚Äôt technically a couple. And I want to do the same but just not living with her is all. Because I moved out.\n\nWhats the right thing to do?
11	Probably to move on.
7	Definitely sounds like you need to figure out how to be the person you want to be, outside of romantic connection. Work on that and leave romance alone right now. 
3	Move on man, focus on your goals!
2	Learn to be a better person and make them a favor by moving out of their lives 
1	It sounds like you need to move on and allow yourself to find your own peace by yourself and give her the space to find hers. If you keep trying to force this, you‚Äôll only drive the wedge between you even deeper. Respect her space and her choice to move forward and learn how to do the same for yourself.
1	Not with this username, buddy! 
2	Sleep problems UGHH	Does this always happens to me? Having problems to sleep at night and then waking up late in the morning just to be yelled at. Bcus I really do have a hard time waking up in the morning I don‚Äôt know why. Also are you bed tidy? Bcus I know for a fact mine is not. It would take all of me to get me make my bed 
3	Nobody should be yelling at you. If someone has a problem with your behavior they should sit down with you and have an honest discussion about it. Lack of control of one's temper to the point of yelling is an ugly trait that can cause serious damage in relationships.
2	Routines are important for good sleeping patterns. Try sleeping on the same time each evening and be persistent, keep trying for several weeks. Don't beat yourself up if it fails in the beginning. 
3	Podcast de Historias en Jap√≥n!	Hola a todos! con mi amigo estamos haciendo un Podcast de la vida en Jap√≥n, esc√∫chenlo, diganme que les parece y compartanselo a todos los que cozcan en el mundo!!!! üòÑ\nhttps://casadebar.podbean.com\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/show/25nJAFOU7bpnj6a0MLZzyu?si=r52ZxgAUTeOZ-TnvOaVA1Qhttps://open.spotify.com/show/25nJAFOU7bpnj6a0MLZzyu?si=r52ZxgAUTeOZ-TnvOaVA1Q
13	All the non-ENFP people on this sub should come here and flirt with us because why not? ENFPs need flirting too!	Not gonna lie, I just want to flirt with people lol. Don't judge!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a guy...yes, guys can be sluts. Women make me slutty. I am a slut inside. I will embrace the sluttiness.
11	Me too; a bisexual slut
8	I love me a good flirt
3	So what animal do you want as a pet?  Part of me wants a clouded leopard.
3	This is too funny. üòÇ
2	I'm down that sounds like a great idea and who knows someone may hook up and this idea was the reason they met and married and are happy!
2	I‚Äôm too shy to flirt
3	>Don't judge!\n\n>I'm a guy...yes, guys can be sluts. Women make me slutty. I am a slut inside. I will embrace the sluttiness.\n\n>ENFPs need flirting too!\n\nHow do you get bi?
1	I like the games. I literally just realized that I‚Äôm not too fond of having sex with people I‚Äôm not particularly interested in though.. like I want people to want to fuck me but I don‚Äôt want to fuck anyone I‚Äôm not infatuated with (which isn‚Äôt that hard to find people I fall in love everyone 5 minutes)
1	You don‚Äôt have to be considered a slut; I don‚Äôt like that word. You can just be open and quite motivated for flirting and sex, totally human. Have a lovely day ;)
1	Please teach me how, I‚Äôm a disaster
34	No idea what to do with my career can y'all help? What do you do? Are there any jobs you enjoy that also make decent money and aren't all consuming? Not talking rich just.. a bit away for retirement, enough to live on with me and my dog.	Seriously no clue what the hell I'm doing and it's driving me crazy.  I'm also currently depressed so it's hard for me to get any ideas of what I want to do that seems at all appealing \n\nI've done campaigns before but they're all consuming and shit pay 
11	I‚Äôm right there with you, friend\n\nDepressed, in my twenties, and want to survive, make art and live with a dog or two\n\nAntidepressants and therapy can help but you also have to take the initiative to move forward, which is often the hard part
11	Consider moving abroad for a while. Somewhere off the beaten path like Phnom Penh, Cambodia . Teach for scratch, teach seriously as a career or eek out a living making art and playing music somewhere like Kampot or Kep. It could at least offer some perspective if nothing else. 
6	Massage therapy can be incredibly rewarding! It's not huge money, but decent if you get in to the right place and like I said- you feel good about the work you're doing. 
4	What do you do now? Someone you can use your experience to leverage yourself into a semi-related career much easier than trying to crack into a new one altogether.\n\nI am a social media manager and I really do love it. I work at an agency that has an amazing culture and allows employees to work remote and have flex time whenever they need it. But my background is in communications, and I imagine working for a creative agency would be harder if your degree is in math. I really enjoy the creative aspects of my job though 
4	I'm a nanny, make a very decent living, work in a large beautiful home with a pool, and greatly enjoy my days. I gain a lot of joy from helping others, especially when it comes to managing schedules, organizing for someone else, and thinking on the fly. My days can be hectic but they are always fun and full of laughter. 
3	I'm getting my masters in socialwork
2	Something in medicine or healthcare my dude! \n\nI‚Äôm working towards being a Physical Therapist right now and it‚Äôs a fantastic job for ENFPs. \n\nConstant interaction with new people, helping people is so rewarding, there‚Äôs always positions available, you can literally go ANYWHERE in the world and be a PT, you learn about the human body too. \n\nIdk man. You gotta find something you love, if you love your work, you don‚Äôt work a day in your life. 
2	I work in the solar industry creating materials and managing inbound communications. It‚Äôs a ton of hours but I get to be creative, the people are good, and the pay is good.
2	I always struggled with what to do. I knew what my passions were: Animals and art. So I do a lot of art in my free time and sell that occasionally and started getting animal jobs- pet store, doggy day are ext. \n\nI never went to college though so I felt very limited in what I could do. I have so much faith in other people, but little in myself. So I just tried going out on a limb a little more. Applying to jobs that were related, but that I was under qualified for. They saw my desire and drive through my willingness to face rejection on multiple occasions and now I have a paid internship at a zoo! Every day is new and exciting and I‚Äôve never been more fulfilled! \n\nSo find the things that make you happy and search around for related jobs. If there is a job you want but you know you can‚Äôt have yet, apply to the same business for something you are qualified for- even if that‚Äôs something like a janitor. Then, make friends with the people who are doing what you want to do and learn from them. I started my job in the photo department and I‚Äôm working my way up! \n\nJust never give up! 
1	I‚Äôm doing Marketing atm and part of the job is to campaign. I enjoy it very much! Pay is decent and enough to cover retirement in the future. I guess I got lucky. Which part of campaigning do you hate? \n\nAlthough to be honest if I had the chance I would study psychology and aim to be a psychologist. Or Neuroscience. Human brains intrigued me the most.
1	What was your interest as a kid? Hobby? What did you find yourself doing for hours? \nLook up Ikigai.
1	I'd start with getting an education and quit campaigns. "Change" is exactly what that'll pay. \n\nGet a solid degree, because gender studies wo t cut it unless you dream of being a starbucks barista or a sandwich artist.  IT, Business, Engineering, the hard sciences. \n\nOr just become a stripper or an uber driver or something. 
12	The Importance Of Building Micro momentum For ENFPs (Business and Fitness Examples)	
21	Why does everyone want INTJ's?	I don't get the obsession so many ENFP's have with INTJ's. They are so different and seem so grumbly and serious and judgy. Not fun or a play partner like I am looking for an would assume other ENFP's would want. Is it because you guys think you can bring them out of their shell and make them fun? A challenge? Or you want someone serious to balance you out? I don't get it.\n\nHow INTJ interactions seem to me:\nme: "What if toilets are an alien species that survives on poop and have integrated into our society. Symbiosis."\n\nINTJ: "Um." or "You're stupid right?" or "You need some help."\n\nWhat I want: "Ooh I'm gonna go feed my toilet pet! Quick go eat bran muffins and drink coffee, we have a mouth to feed."\n\nI want someone who is funny and silly like me who makes me want to be sillier. Someone I can do bits with, and wordplay, puns, accents, impressions, improv.\n\nSo every day is an amazing game of love and hilarity.\n\nI want someone who can keep up with my creativity and even be better than me.\n\nSomeone I can break out into song with and dance.\n\nBasically I want someone like me, another ENFP.\n\nMaybe because I am in my shell and want someone to break out of the most introverted extrovert mold with.
17	I think you would like an INFP because I swear I have had those conversations with my ENFP friend lol. 
12	I would be tickled by that question and try to think of how to add to your theory.\n\nPlease don't put us all in that negative bucket. Some of us enjoy being silly too.
11	The attraction for INTJs is exaggerated. A lot of ENFPs here seem to like the reserved introverted types because they like the challenge of getting them to open up, but a lot of ENFPs mistakenly assume INTJs are the only introverts like that. They like the idea of someone mysterious and introverted because it's the opposite of their social butterfly nature, but those traits aren't exclusive to INTJs. That's why you see a lot of ENFPs friends/dating INFPs and INFJs.\n\nThe attraction is primarily to INxx types, most ENFPs here seem to not be attracted as much to Sensor types because they don't seem to just instinctively "get you" like other Intuitives do.
15	I am an INTJ(F) and would laugh so hard at that theory take a very analytical yet humorous approach as a response. I am quite free form and am constantly looking to laugh and be funny. We‚Äôre not all dry robots. I‚Äôm actually goofing off as much as possible outside the necessary I‚Äôm at work type of environments 
6	Honestly...\n\nit's just because you haven't got them out of their shell. \n\nAn INTJ can totally dance with you if you guys are on that intimate level. \n\nIf you don't want to invest...then I guess you can easily dance with another enfp/infp... lol... but most likely not sustainable  (while not impossible...just not deep enough in the long run...)
6	I think I like my INTJ because he's smart, grounded, and has good ideas. I think he's kinda boring sometimes, but I've lived life without him for a time and I've made some (typically) shotgun mistakes that he probably would have thought harder about and solved and saved me time. So he's useful to have around and he makes me laugh.\n\nWe just had this conversation on the couch. He's just lying there staring at the ceiling while I'm surfing my phone. I'm like, what are you doing? He says he's thinking. I'm like, what are you thinking about? A lot of things, work, problems. I tell him truthfully I don't think I've ever laid down and just... thought about stuff. I either know it or I don't but thinking isn't going to solve anything. To me, looking up how to solve the problem or forums would work better. But he just is the way he is. He boggles my mind but the relationship just works really well so that's why I like him. And he happens to be an INTJ. Ymmv.
6	Seems you are frustrated by the ignoring / observing Ne style that INTJs have.  We too have Ne but it is in shadow / subdued and it takes the right type qof coaxing to engage the playfulness Ne in the INTJ.\n\nThe secret to getting the playfulness Ne of an INTJ to come out is related to Se followed by Fi.\n\nSe ==> Fi ==> playful Ne.\n\nNote when an INTJ already likes you in and values the relationship / you are in their mental circle you can start just with Fi.\n\nI am sorry if this is cryptic, but what I am saying is synchorize with the INTJ sensory wise in the same moment.  Then share a same value and then pivot to the pattern recognition silliness.
8	Sounds like you should date an ENTP. Me and many other ENFPs have found great success with that match. \n\nI don't get the INTJ obsession either. If I were to guess, it's probably the aloofness of INTJs. But they are (usually) SO intense. I compare a couple friends I have--one is ENTP and the other is INTJ. The INTJ likes me a lot and will give me a lot of the things he thinks I want because he's "chosen" me. He's constantly trying to make me grow and improve. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I like that, but it's exhausting after a while. I couldn't be in a relationship with someone like that. The ENTP is weirdly non-confrontational and forces me to use my Te which is exciting to me. I dunno... I also like how he just randomly observes me then hits me with such a simple prescription when we get into an argument. Most recent insight: "you're acting out of insecurity." Which was just enough information for me to learn from that mistake. He's also really silly. And really easy to make happy.  People think ENFPs are childlike, but ENTPs have us beat by a mile. IDK, just my thoughts. Two ENFPs could work too. 
3	I agree, and I haven't had any really positive experiences with INTJs either as friend or romantic partners. I find that they are similar to INFPs in a way, because they are inwardly super sensitive (Fi) but outwardly very harsh (Te) which can be hurtful and frustrating. A high percentage of them seem quite melancholic in nature, too. I've had much better and more stable long-term friendships and romantic connections with INTPs and INFJs. In general I prefer to date other NFs, though. 
3	I have an INTJ guy who‚Äôd play along and respond with some hilarious quip to your wacky theories. He‚Äôs just a very funny guy in general. \n\nBut I know several more INTJs who wouldn‚Äôt play along and just either laugh, ignore, or dissect it somehow. Shared intuition usually means they‚Äôll appreciate the weirdness rather than outright dismiss it as an SJ might.\n\nAn INFJ male I know would also play along and he‚Äôs pretty funny as well. In short, I think it depends on the individual, not type. An uncontroversial conclusion but ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
3	I was married to an INTJ for almost 10 years. We ended up splitting up this last April; we were too incompatible. He found another INTJ and they compliment each other so well. I recently started dating another ENFP and that‚Äôs exactly what our relationship is like. We goof off, dance while we‚Äôre waiting in line and make the same jokes and think the same things. I‚Äôve experienced partners with both personality types and they both have their pros and cons. \n\nWhen I was with the INTJ, I was a lot more responsible and serious.  I often felt suffocated by the weight of the responsibilities I had just to keep up with the INTJ and avoid resentment for not being an adult enough for them. They always felt like I was avoiding responsibilities when it was really that I hate being told what to do and I hated always feeling like I was the pee-on and they were the one who called the shots. With the ENFP, we can both be irresponsible or forgetful with the same things and it‚Äôs been a learning curve trying to figure out solutions. But, it‚Äôs been pretty fun along the way. It‚Äôs also really weird getting annoyed and angry at someone for doing the same things that I do and being on the other end of some of my quirks; I actually have empathy for a lot of the annoying things I did to the INTJ because the ENFP has done them to me.  The relationship with the ENFP is still rather new, so I can‚Äôt tell you which one I truly get along with yet; the INTJ knows me inside and out and predicts my behavior almost to a T, but the ENFP GETS me and understands why I do things just because it‚Äôs also what they do. Ya know?
3	I am an ENFP and INTJs are my favourite people! My INTJ keeps me grounded and we just balance each other out perfectly. Tbh I would hang out with an INTJ over another ENFP any day (sorry friends lol). I also find my INTJ and I complement each other so well because we appreciate our differences so much (were extremely different). I love that my INTJ is so emotionally closed off and private to most of the world but not to me :)
2	comparably, get to INTP/ENTP subreddit . There is some rudeness to that type, due to lack of Fi, which would make me want to kill 'em long term. On the other hand, ENTJ and INTJ do have both Te and Fi so their way of making decisions and their morality is much more compatible with ours. \n\nTalking in Te ways, especially combined with Ne will make us give examples, metaphors and get straight to the point - Ti is otherwise. If you ever had this super condensed math book that is impossible to read unless you already know the stuff, it was written by someone with Ti. Ti is annoyed by our way of talking, and we are annoyed by all their shenanigans. When I'm researching a way to improve my life, like health, I will research psychology, psychiatry, healthy foods, exercise and take the creme out of all the knowledge while Ti is still struck perfecting one of them. \n\nI admire Ti and wish I had more of it, but I just can't stand their way of talking/reasoning. 
2	Yeahhhh intjs can be like that when you arent close to them lol. As soon as they open up more they will start to talk about random and stupid/funny stuff all the time. (Noticed this a lot with an uni intj friend who acted like he didnt care about our friendgroup at all and was annoyed of our joking. But lately he got more open and went along more with the fun)\nIt might take some time but dont be discouraged if they dont go with your jokes right away, just keep pushing till they feel safe enough to go along with your  crazy theories lol\n\nThey can be really cute to watch opening up more and more. I think thats one of many sides  enfps enjoy about intjs. (But yes i remember being frustrated with some of them too. Really depends a lot on the person  i guess)\n\nAlso maybe some of your intj encounters were in fact istjs? They can appear pretty similar and are confused with eachother sometimes. Afaik istjs can be silly and fun too but they are rather scared away or judgy regarding too crazy theories and ideas lol
2	I saw a post somewhere in our r/intj sub that some INTJs online are mistyped and are actually ISTJs. Some are also just depressed or have some behavioral problems so they are mistyped as INTJ. \n\nDon‚Äôt worry, some INTJs are still creative and fun out there. I would personally laugh if you said that to me too. :)
2	I used to date an INTJ and he was funny and goofy just the way you described; we just had to get close first before he opened up like that. We used to literally joke about our teachers being aliens and make up whole worlds and have conversations exclusively in emojis. I will admit, part of me did like the challenge of getting someone to open up‚Äîeach time he did felt like a little victory‚Äîbut I also just loved his humor. He could be totally serious and engage in a deep conversation about theology or he could be completely ridiculous. I liked how he had both those qualities.
2	> INTJ: "Um." or "You're stupid right?" or "You need some help."\n\nNo person, regardless of type, who cares about you would say that to your face.
3	One of my best friends is INTJ. He doesn‚Äôt always understand me, but he‚Äôs very fascinated and inspired by my presence. On the other hand, I admire the way he practically completes the problems I only solve in terms of ideas.\nI really don‚Äôt know if I could fall in love if he was a woman.
2	Yeah, but wouldnt that someone get boring after awhile when they think, act, and do the same things? \n\nIts like asking the question: would you want the whole world to be like you or everyone be different? 
1	Um, I don't know if I'm an INTJ, but I don't know how to answer stupid questions. Like, I know you're joking, but yeah I just don't know what to say to that. I guess the more logical or grounded types would prefer an INTJ. And it's possible ENFPs want INFJs, not INTJs, and they're mixing them up, or they're ENTPs, not ENFPs. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1	I have to agree. I give everyone the benefit of the doubt to start out with; with INTJ's, sooner or later the stubborness, self righteousness and judginess comes out. I can get along with them well enough and they are a tremendous asset to a team, but I prefer to keep them at arm's length and not really associate with them closely. \n\nI've associated with one recently whose curiosity I've piqued and now feel like a science experiment, with them picking/prodding at me to figure out how I tick. 
1	Date people you like and quit worrying so much about type. You may find you gravitate towards one type or another then great. I find I like INXX.
1	My SO is an INFP and we get along just fine.  We do have super small bumps from time to time but ultimately, I just love seeing her laugh when I'm being the goof ball that I am.  Just last night before going to bed we spent an hour or so just laughing at how I was making pig squealing sounds and matching it with some movie we were watching.   She actually peed her self a little :) 
1	I'm honestly not sure, but I always feel a deep connection with an intj before either of us has said a word.
2	Why am I like this?!	Usually I‚Äôm very good at expressing how I feel with just about anyone. But when it comes to my boyfriend it‚Äôs so hard for me to express or say how I feel. Like for example, it‚Äôs so hard for me to muster out how much he means to me and that I love him. Why is this? Also I can‚Äôt just say these things like ‚ÄúI really care about you‚Äù and ‚Äúeverything you do means a lot to me‚Äù without crying in front of him. Like I have to build up the courage to say it. :(( 
5	It's because you're being very vulnerable which is scary. But it is ok to be vulnerable and ok to cry.
2	I get the feelings its because it holds so much more weight for you with him.\nAnd more so you're used to having to hold back so much because maybe you've invested yourself fully before and been very hurt because of it.\nYou more resilient than you believe you can do this I promise! I believe in you! Make it your mission to say it as SOON as you feel it! X
78	Immature VS mature ENFP's: what are the behaviors?	So I used to be a pretty toxic and shitty person, even to my friends. I'd get overly possessive, jealous, etc... But I feel like I worked very hard on myself the past few years, and looking back I can't believe how I used to be. I was wondering if there other ENFP's here who've gone through a similar development and what your toxic behaviors were VS your behavior now. Often when I see posts of other types talking shit about ENFP's, the behaviors they describe sound like the old me so it could help them differentiate between the different kinds of ENFP's instead of just generalizing. 
83	It seems to me that immature ENFPs tend to lack follow through, and aren't very committed to friends, to romantic partners, or to new projects they have started. Immature ENFPs also often neglect their physical health and lack embodied physical awareness, and lack the ability to be in the present moment. A lot of immature ENFPs are Enneagram Type Sevens who focus on having fun, experiencing novelty and being positive, but lack the ability to really face their shadow and embrace the more challenging emotions like sadness, grief and anger.\n\nMature ENFPs tend to be more committed and have a higher degree of follow-through in all areas of life. They generally prioritise taking care of their health and listen to their body's needs. They have a more grounded, embodied presence, and are more centred. Mature ENFPs have usually spent time getting in touch with their Fi and have a well-developed value system. They also tend to be more willing to face difficult emotions head-on and face their shadow, rather than denying it or avoiding it by focusing on having fun. \n\nHaving said that, the path of maturity and growth depends a lot on various factors like Enneagram type, attachment style, and so on. An ENFP Enneagram 2 might have quite a different growth journey in some ways.
23	Immature/unhealthy me: talking over people, waiting to talk instead of listening, relating every single topic back to myself and my experiences, moving easily between friend groups without checking to make sure my Introvert friends weren't feeling abandoned, believing every single thing my emotions ever said to me and reacting accordingly, writing angsty emo poetry lol, lashing out at people for trying to cheer me up when I felt miserable \n\nMature/somewhat healthier me still struggles but has addressed the above issues like this: \n\n**listen to listen, stay quiet until someone is obviously done expressing a thought and then repeat it back to make sure I've understood their perspective\n\n**Ask questions more often than declaring my opinion\n\n**consider whether someone is asking for advice or just sharing, and ask permission to advise before relating the topic to myself (or just keep it to myself)\n\n**check in on friends regularly (and casually, no melodrama) and make a point of telling them exactly what I appreciate about them as a person when possible without expecting them to do the same for me\n\n**observe the feelings, hear them out, but determine actions based on truth and reality rather than giving feelings too much authority (very hard, took so much work) \n\n**still make occasional angsty emo poetry but recognize it's just the expression of a fleeting moment and not the scope of my existence\n\n**allow myself to vent but only when I'm willing to let it go after and listen to someone's kindness when I'm done. If I know I'm not ready to be cheered up, I journal instead. If someone tries to help, I spend my emotional energy appreciating the effort and separate the bad advice or ill-timed cheer from that person. Keep the friend, Chuck the advice. 
11	Oh wow. I've had an eerily similar experience this past year and a half.\nI used to be a very toxic person. The same jealousy and possessiveness and extreme mood swings. I cringe everytime I remember my vvvv shitty behavior.\nBut my change/growth was actually triggered when I was diagnosed with ADHD. It was a huge turning point in my life and I decided to take a step back and put everything under a microscope. Basically, in a way you could say I was trying to purge my personality, figuring out what needs to go and what should stay.\nI mean it started with me trying to figure out what was my ADHD and what was me. But in hindsight, it was a lot of self-exploration that helped me grow. I'm a little clearer now on what's my ADHD brain and what's not... But yeah. It was a very fun journey.
10	Yea. I was super scared of commitment, ditsy, flaky, over-sharing, expecting people to protect me & take care of me emotionally. Like a toddler. Then I went through some shit and now i'm actually able to step back and choose the option/behavior that's better for the greater good versus just myself. I'm still excessively emotional, and working on that
6	Going from superficial empathy to legitimate empathy. \nWhen you learn how your behavior affects others and actively adjust your behavior in response. 
5	I was very similar to you, OP. When I was a teenager, I was very aggressive, jealous, and even mean to my friends. My best friend takes all of those aspects and puts them on extreme mode. He is the type of guy that when he takes a girl on date, he expects her to sleep with him because he spent time and money on her. That should give you a gauge of his personality.\n\nI am 29 year years old (30 on March 5th) and I have let go of so many of those Negative emotions and behaviors. I try to stay positive and help others uplift themselves as well. I am a few years away from becoming a college professor, just so that I can help others better themselves as well! I am also happily married and have a 5 year daughter with my wife. =)\n\nMy best friend still lives the same way as he did when I was a teenager. He has been single for almost a decade now (I WONDER WHYYYY? Lol). Our friendship has drifted apart. He gives my positive personality as "holier than thou" when it is just me trying to be nice and helpful. But I still talk to him because I want to help bring light into his life.\n\nIn short:\n\nENFPs are a extraverted cognitive type of thinker. We base our thoughts and feelings off of what others say, or do, and what our surroundings are like. If you listen to sad music, have mean friends/family/people around you, then you will be more Negative/sad/angry.\n\nIf you keep positive people/influences/surroundings around you, then you will be the bright, cheerful beam of love, laughter and inspiration that you were always meant to be!
7	Horrible ego centrism. 
3	I find that as I get older and gain more perspective, I mature.  I'm not so quick to make snap judgements and give into my impulses.  And my anxiety, which was through the roof when I was in my 20s and 30s is much, much better.
2	I used to be SO desperate for validation. I want EVRRYONE to like me. I valued people for being ‚Äúspecial‚Äù instead of for being a good person. Instead of changing myself when I was making myself miserable, I would seek attention. It was like a hit of a drug.\n\nEventually this resulted in me dating an abusive misogynist. I literally gave up everything to be with him and it didn‚Äôt work. It forced and motivated me to change the things that were really wrong with me. My life is much better now. I‚Äôm much happier and I found the love of my life. 
2	Currently going through the process. It‚Äôs crazy how something‚Äôs look different when you‚Äôre given more insight. 
1	other types talk shit about us?
1	I used to have a friend that was deep into conspiracy theories, chem-trails, Alex Jones, and ect. He would talk endlessly about them and often kill the mood or scare off the girls my other friends and I would be spending time with together. When I moved away he got worse and spread onto social media. Looking back I feel bad for all the cyber bullying and gaslighting I did to him during that time. I have definitely grown in the last 8 years since, but he's still lamenting about the illuminati and whatever comes down the flat earth turnpike. I guess my trolling didn't have much of a long term impact, but I would never act like that now.  
1	I was a religious bigot. I was jealous, insecure, and I have so much need for external validation.\n\nI started really questioning my beliefs and values and I started to change. I am much more at peace with myself now and I have a lot less intense uncontrollable emotions.
2	ISTJ here, how can I communicate better with my ENFP partner?	Hi, everyone. I‚Äôm looking for ways to communicate to my ENFP partner that I understand and see them. I think they need more words of affirmation to make them feel loved. I do love them deeply but as an ISTJ, I don‚Äôt always know how to express that in a productive way that registers with my partner. \n\nI would appreciate any examples you could share to guide me. \n\n
9	Remind them how great they are and give specific reasons as to why they‚Äôre great. Pay attention to them and watch what they do. Appreciate them for doing things, little things like taking out the trash (hey, thanks for taking out the trash that really helps!). Really listen to what they‚Äôre saying and bring it up again in future conversations, example, if they say they‚Äôre interested in visiting some place in the future, bring it up later and ask them about it. Plan things for them (were always the ones stuck planning everything, which is okay, but sometimes we like when other people take over and do something for us). Remember things they like and present them randomly (a warm towel after a shower, an iced coffee before work, their favorite snack). Commend them when they do something big or small (an A on a test, a promotion at work, surviving a long week, handling a tough situation with grace). Remind them that you‚Äôre there for them and always will be (sometimes we feel alone and need to be reminded we‚Äôre not). Show patience with them when they‚Äôre scatterbrained or stressed out or jumping from one place to the next. Always practice empathetic listening. Most importantly, always ask how we are doing (authentically!). Are you okay? Do you need help with this? How does this situation make you feel? Tell me what‚Äôs bothering you? We‚Äôre always so focused on how other people are doing and helping other people with their problems that we often feel forgotten. We‚Äôre too stubborn sometimes to ask for help or admit that we‚Äôre struggling because we need to give off the illusion we have it all together even when we do not. Also we hate feeling like we‚Äôre burdening someone. So if you really want to help you really need to be patient and reassure that they‚Äôre not a burden and that you‚Äôre more than willing to help them with whatever the situation is. SOMETIMES If we ask for help then it must mean we really need it and sometimes at that point it is because we are falling apart at the seams so extra attention to the situation is important at that point. Never criticize them for opening up about something personal because it means they lowered their guard, they really trusted you to tell you that bit of information. criticism will only hurt their self esteem and put their guard back up. 
5	Ask them directly they will tell you.\nThose kind of discussion should be a regular in a healthy relationship.
10	Why are ENFPs called "campaigners"	Tbh that sounds a lot more like ENFJs to me, but idk *shoulder shrug*
14	I‚Äôm not sure but I‚Äôve also seen ‚Äúthe inspirer,‚Äù ‚Äúthe champion‚Äù and ‚Äúthe advocate,‚Äù depending on the website\n\nI just take those names with a grain of salt. I think I‚Äôm more of a dreamer and adventurer :>
10	Because with our Fi we usually have strong principles we believe in and will fight for. With our Te (if we develop it more) we can champion these causes. With our Ne we can think of new ways to campaign for these causes and use our Te to know the best way to say it so everyone can understand.
5	Because I always try and convince my friends that we should build tiny houses on wheels together, start a band, or that giants ACTUALLY have existed once.
2	Its just a nick name. Dont think much into that part, if anything, check out the cogonitive functions. I got some pretty good insight studying those.
2	What are your ideas and dreams? üòä Big and small 
1	Am i the only ENFP thats somehow Ni?	I always get enfp on mbti tests and even when i looked deep into other types i confirmed that i relate completey to enfp right. But when i started looking into functions i realized my dominant function is Ni. Im like 90% intuitive in that way. I'm  still extraverted but the only thing is i express my iNtuition in an introverted way being happy just thinking to myself. But Ni isnt one of the ENFP functions. Sooo am i misunderstanding functions, or actually an introvert or do i necessarily have to be like Fe or the other enfp functions? Idk
8	Ne can be happy just thinking to itself and mostly does. The extroverted part of Ne just means it's directed outward and wide, while introverted functions are directed inward and deep. But both Ne and Ni are perceiving functions and you can be a quiet perceiver, observing people from a corner as I often did at parties.\n\nWe are called the most introverted extroverts and need a lot of alone time, I would say more than we need people time. we use it to decompress and process everything we experienced out there, see how we value it, if we can out it into action and catalog it for future connections.\n\nNe doesn't mean you talk it out with people. You can if you are brainstorming together I guess. But intuition is a mind kind of function, often just thinking and perceiving and thinking more on that. The real difference in Ni vs Ne is that Ni is taking in lots of possibilities and information and diving the one good choice and then diving deep on that one choice seeing where it could potentially go. From what I hear it is mostly passive, it just happens. The "Aha!" or "Eureka!" moments. Ne is looking at one thing and expanding outward to all the possibilities of it and all futures. It is ideas bouncing off ideas and making other connections producing new ideas in an idea cloud.\n\nThe best way I've found to describe it is this: Ni is finding a needle in a haystack, Ne is finding a haystack in a needle.\n\nNi types seem to me to be pretty single-minded sometimes. Have a harder time multi-tasking. Like if you're talking about something they want to just focus on that one thing. They might not appreciate the interjection of a funny meme you just saw as it is a distraction.\n\nAnother thing about Ne is because we can see all possibilities coupled with Fi we can naturally walk in anyone's shoes. We can see things from every perspective. We imagine how we would feel in that situation and going through what that person did and we understand them. We might vehemently disagree but we get how they might get to that way of thinking. And we see all sides so can play devil's advocate.
1	Adventure Time Sunday!	\n/r/ENFP! What shenanigans have you been up to this week? Any new adventures planned for the next?\n\nLet's here some stories!
3	I told my parents about my new boyfriend, and while at the time I felt it all went well, I'm having second thoughts about the situation now. Not that the relationship is flawed: I still love being with him! I mean that at the time I thought my parents took it relatively well, now I'm not too sure anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend is about ten years my senior and of Turkish descent. He came to my country to work as a research assistant at the university, and he's been nothing but kind and loving so far. We're both lindy hop dancers and that's how we met. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy dad barely said a word, except for suggesting that my boyfriend is """some kind of Erdogan supporter""". He's not, and I mentioned that pretty upfront, thanks for clearly not listening. My sister and mother started joking about tajines: joking that that's all he eats, joking that he should own one if he doesn't already, joking that he should make them tajine sometime... Etc. "Haha perhaps he only ever drinks tea and nothing else!" "Haha we'll put out a prayer mat for him and sound the call-to-prayer at 6AM!" "Ohh we're only joking, don't be so sensitive about it!"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould I really be able to take all these jokes here? I'm worried sick about the day they actually meet him in person, and that they'll be inconsiderate and make these same kind of dumb jokes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think his heritage and culture is incredibly interesting and I doubt I'll ever grow tired of learning more about it, and hearing him talk about how he grew up. He's without a doubt the kindest man I've ever been with and I haven't felt unsafe or insecure around him once. It hurts that I have to feel so concerned, just because he's not Belgian. If we're happy together, it shouldn't matter one bit.
3	ENFP 4w5 impossible?	I'm absolutely sure that I'm an ENFP and have now consistently also tested as enneagram 4w5. I've read multiple 4 type explanations and it does resonate with me. However, I hear that ENFP and 4w5 is an impossible combo.\n\nAnyone else here gotten the same typing? Is this really impossible? 
2	I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs impossible but the tests are also unreliable, IMO\n\nLook into your [fears and motivations](https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2018/10/04/heres-what-you-fear-based-on-your-enneagram-type/)\nto determine your type rather than traits. How you deal with pain, as well\n\nAlso, peek around r/enneagram\n\nI think 4w5s are typically Fi-doms (IxFPs) and INFJs (although some people say that these are mistyped Fi-doms) but I wouldn‚Äôt rule out other types\n\nI‚Äôm a 7w6, myself :)
2	ENFP 4w5 here. Both definitive, in my opinion. 
2	Do you find your percentage in Meyers Briggs sort of 60/40 in any section? For me, I sort of just make it over the line into extroversion. 
2	why would that be impossible when an overwhelming part of ENFPs are usually 4s or 7s?
1	Hey, I tested as an ENFP 4w5 and I find it pretty accurate in my case. I have read about it and found an ENFP 4w5 describing his experiencs on youtube too. (Some people thought he could be an INTJ, which makes sense! I got influenced by my INTJ childhood friend and vice versa) \n\nThough this weird mix could just mean that the effect of eg introversion are not as strong as it would be for an INFP or INFJ. We extrovert more and this of course would have an effect on our behavior compared to an 4w5 in introverted types. That's at least how I understood it, but I am not an expert on this at all. \n\nI think what is more important though is how to become a healthy 4 (if you aren't already :P) than an unhealthy one!  That's really helpful to know how your ideal self could look like and vice versa. And that applies to every 4!\n\nHope that helps! :)
2	What do you dislike about ENTPs?	
9	Inhonesty and Playing around with emotions
6	For the ones I have met, (I am not sure if this is all), it is their addiction to debate, conflicts, and arguing. Many of the ones I met have also been pretty judgemental, but would never admit that to themselves. 
5	I love ENTPs. Most of you guys are really cool and funny and interesting. \n\nSome things about ENTPs I don't like as much is according to own experiences:\n\nThey don't know on their own when they went too far with whatever they did or said - especially when feelings got hurt. Then there are some of them who hide their weaknesses behind a queue of excuses instead of just accepting it and work on them. Also it is sometimes way too difficult to get ENTPs to sit and listen for a few minutes but who am I kidding :D
2	I dont dislike entps. There are several that are close to me. But I can tire of their desire to ‚Äúlogic‚Äù everything. Sometimes Im just being goofy and they (with good intentions) try to engage... but with buzzkill form. Its also important to say they don‚Äôt *always* do that, but it happens regularly. 
1	They are an intelligent, fun, hardly ever boring type but a lot of them have problems with empathy.
1	I love ENTPs but yes like u/surfingonthetawaves has said, they can play around with people's emotions. I think most of the time they don't realize how they themselves actually feel.
13	Do other ENFP's get easily hurt by the words of other? What do you do?	
9	Depends who it's coming from. From strangers? I couldn't care less.\n\nFrom loved ones? I overthink it and feel bad about it for a little while. But I'd always try to talk it out with them and that usually fixes it. Shows me their point of view and gives clearance on the situation.
6	I try to ignore . But get hurt anyways . 
3	Depends... \n\nsome people are more direct... and that's just part of their cognitive function... if you can understand that then... they mean well. \n\nThen there's the other side when people are just outright rude and arrogant ... \n\n&#x200B;\n\nmight take some time to discern the differences.... comes with maturity
3	Some people will say needlessly spiteful things to you over the course of your life. Just remember that something damaged them so much that they need to make themselves feel better by trying making you feel bad. Then respond with empathy for friends, and pity for others.
2	No. Either  it's a lie, in which case who cares? I know who I am. Or it's true, in which case I take it in and learn from it. I welcome criticism because it helps me know what to improve so I can grow.
2	I find that with the correct amount of empathy and commission, nothing can truly hurt you.\n\nEdit: it's important to identify if there is real criticism in there, though, and to make improvements in yourself as you are able.
2	Yes I can get hurt by the words of someone else. I noticed that it is because I let myself get hurt. I can not care entirely about it at all. But then life would be meaningless. So I chose to let myself feel that emotion, so that I can better understand myself and them.
52	Plz say I‚Äôm not the only one who does this shit!	I am ENFP and I am extraverted but annoyingly it‚Äôs only around certain people and in certain environments. If I‚Äôm in a environment I am not feeling at ease in I will actually do anything I can do to get out of it and stay unseen. \nI just left dinner at my boyfriends house went out the back door climbed over the fence and walked all the way around to his room in the garage so they wouldn‚Äôt see me threw the huge windows in the front. It‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt until I sat down inside his room that I stoped and thought ‚Äúyou actual freak. You just climbed a stinking fence instead of just sitting and mingling‚Äù \nPlz don‚Äôt say I‚Äôm alone in this :(
26	I ran two miles to use the bathroom cuz I didn't want to shit in my friends parents cabin bathroom....\n\n\nTurns out that bathroom was locked and I had to run back and shit in my friends parents cabin  bathroom...  
13	I feel that so much. Even if I‚Äôm hella tight with a group, and something starts to happen I‚Äôm not cool with, my ass is GONE.
11	I left a dance cause I didn‚Äôt want to be there. You aren‚Äôt alone!!
8	that is so me!! i think it's because of my social anxiety. when i'm comfortable, i could be the loudest and the one with the most idgaf attitude. but when i feel unsafe, or with people i don't like/am not comfortable with, or when i'm in huge crowds, i get super anxious and want to get out ASAP and would do the weirdest things just not to be noticed. 
8	Yes, I‚Äôm exactly the same way!! When I was in middle school I was so uncomfortable because I just didn‚Äôt vibe with the other kids. I was known as the quiet girl who‚Äôd just sit and read her book in a corner. Now fast forward to my senior year of high school, where I do get along with (most lol) of the kids in my class/school, and I‚Äôm known as the crazy energetic person who‚Äôs very extroverted. So yeah, environment plays a huge factor
5	The Irish goodbye has played an important role in my life.
4	I'm the same way!!\nComfortable environment I'm confident and spunky, getting to know everyone with great caring convo. \n\nGet me in an unfamiliar/unsafe environment and all my brain processes are redirected into anlysis, observation, damage control, I seem a lot more shy.\n\nI think it's natural for ENFP. We need time to process the environment in order to blend into it well. If we can't blend into it, it's like social poison and we want to leave.
5	I'm in my 30s so I don't actually run away, lol, but I did use the "my parents said no" card a LOT growing up, had my dad pick me up multiple times from parties in midden school and high school... Even now, I may not leave physically, but I do start to fade away in conversation til I'm literally outside the circle, against a wall, looking out a window and lost in my own mind. I get bored or overwhelmed, I sometimes feel small and stupid when the topic isn't something I understand or if I joke around but it doesn't land. I over think a lot and assume my friends have suddenly all remembered I'm a total weirdo, haha. 
3	Ohh gosh me too. Too nice to just tell someone that you're gonna peace out and scared they will misunderstand, so you ditch to get out of the uncomfortable situation and then sit in your car and take a deep breath and wonder "wtf did I just do?" Not sure if it's anxiety or our personality but yes I've done this a number of times. 
3	You're not alone. I leave home to pick up my kids from school at the very last minute so I don't have to  stand around and talk to the other Mums. I can't stand the small talk and feel like they're judging me (when they probably aren't).
3	You are not alone! I would have house parties, and once 10 pm hits, I announce that I am tired and that I‚Äôm going to sleep. Everyone else is free to stay and mingle but I am definitely going to bed.\n\nOther times I stay and mingle, it depends on how I am feeling at the time. I have no shame in acting as I please if it doesn‚Äôt ruin someone else‚Äôs life.
3	I have a bad habit of over thinking and doing really awkward shit because I panicked and couldn‚Äôt think of the normal thing to do. \n\nJust have to remind yourself to slow the fuck down and ask what a person smarter than you would do. 
1	My best friend is enfp, and I'm infp. We were planning on going to a free rock concert at a pub for over a month. I know the area better than her because I grew up here. I told her this particular bar is sometimes packed or sometimes dead.\nWe get there, and I see a giant crowd outside the bar. Well, when she sees the crowd she let's out a shocked, "holy shit!!" Starts laughing and grabs my arm.\nI lead her to a spot with a bench past the bar where you can hear the music really loud but no one can see you, maybe we can adjust slowly. I would sit there through the years when I was too broke to go to the bar, but wanted to listen to music without seeming like a creepy chick. I am pretty creepy, even to most of the rocker crowd. We smoke for ten minutes and opt to get Steak and Shake. \nGet to the door and she freezes, "can we go through the drive thru?" I said of course. Needless to say, we got very dressed up for a rock concert, and ended up eating Steak n Shake in the car, listening to Tool,  smoking weed, and talking about our recent transcendental experiences. She was so apologetic about it too, but we both felt off about that concert so why be sorry?
120	A great people person........50% of the time.	Anyone else feel that they are great people people and can almost blend in with any crowd? I feel that way, the issue being, I only feel that way half the time.  I have days where I want to be secluded and isolate myself and I‚Äôm not really sure why. I‚Äôm currently trying to decide where to take my education and I keep reminding myself that I am great with people, but then again, half the time I‚Äôm not. What gives, amigos?
55	I think that‚Äôs not too uncommon for ENxPs\n\nIf I don‚Äôt feel stimulated or curious about my environment/people/ideas, I can retreat into my head. It‚Äôs like my social battery needs something ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù to spark it
19	Ooh I feel this. What's worse is when my introversion hits during work. I have to work with (literally) everyone in my building including guests, phone calls, and emails. During those days (which have been getting even more frequent) I'm in no mood to socialize or see anyone. I try to stay friendly but I can tell people act more put-off when I'm like this and they'll make backhanded comments like "I hope your day goes better!" Like I'm happy in those moments--I just don't want anyone around me or talking to me. It's frustrating. 
13	Yes, like sometimes I‚Äôm a smooth life of the party,  other times I literally forget how to have regular conversations with people and am super quiet. I haven‚Äôt found any patterns in how each occurs, either; and it‚Äôs pretty annoying. 
10	I'm exactly the same. One of my friends who is pretty well versed on personality types and introverts calls me an "introverted" extrovert, lol. \n\nI love being out with people and doing shit. I will talk to/at anyone showing even the slightest signs of wanting to listen to me. I love public speaking and being in front of an audience. \n\nBut I equally love sitting at home and doing nothing except drawing and hanging out with my dog and talking to no one. \n\nBoth are so appealing to me that it can freeze me up in indecision when trying to get a basic plan for the week laid out. \n\n
6	**EXACTLY.ME.**
6	I have found a small pattern for me. Usually week starts with my moody self that wants peace and quiet. When Wednesday kicks in I am almost myself until at the end of work day friday I am my bubbly self at its peak. Weekends are usually with family sometimes very active sometimes just chilling. But weekends reset me completely.\n\nAlso the weather is a major factor. If its low pressure outside I feel very moody and not very chatty. On sunny days I explode with energy. 
4	We are great people people. People persons? The other half of the time you're referring to is when we are  trying to regain all we have given/been drained of.... 
4	You guys normally are great with people and dont cut yourself short by thinking you just "blend in".. Maybe it's because yall spend so much time exploring different & new ventures externally.\n\nThen you may come to a sudden realization that you havent put as close to as much energy internally? The time you need to be alone is probably just you  reflecting introspectively so that you'll better understand yourself. \n\nI dont know. I think I stick out like a sore thumb around people or at social events but people tell me that's not it at all and that I actually can seem like the most comfortable person there..\n
5	I usually turn introvert under stress or when I‚Äôm tired. Nobody wants to be with people 100% of the time, I think jobs that involve being with people are really good for ENFPs so give it a try
4	I am the same, \nI'm either a hot mess at a party having great time everyone or I'm the grinch and I just dont wanna be there (which normally results in me chucking my phone off the harbour bridge or stealing upmarket pub plants from bathrooms)\nI know I got issues, I'm seeing a therapist lol.\n\nI've thought about this before, and I came to the conclusion it's about energies in the environment.\nJust like a bad smell can make someone want to leave a room, it's the same when you are sensitive to everyone's energy around you.\n\nNext time you are out, experiment with it. Ask yourself how you feel before meeting up, during, and after. Was it a positive or negative experience? Sometimes you dont even know why you feel awful, as no one in particular said anything but it's funny how truth reveals itself! 
5	Yesss, sometimes I‚Äôm like the best socializer other times I‚Äôm like leave me alone I wish I was more introverted. I like the dichotomy though and I‚Äôm grateful for it, keeps me stimulated but also introspective 
3	this is why i dont have friends. aloof like a cat weeks on end. i actually thought i was bipolar until i came across mbti and realized what was happening. sometimes if im at work and i want to go aloof but cant, i start having panic attacks. had one this week, lasted off and on for an hour, i wanted to go home so badly.
2	Yes ! 
2	YEP\n\n&#x200B;
2	I don‚Äôt wanna blend into a crowd, would rather stick out tbh. 
1	Gosh...so much this. I'm currently avoiding a social  gathering because i can't be arsed to move off the couch and don't wanna be outside past 9 pm... But if I was there I know I would probably have enjoyed it, because I'm an extrovert. I miss being social >_<

4	Enfp's being selfish	What do you think about Enfp's, who due to their Fi Parent(Ones own feelings) and Si Inferior (Fear of receiving bad sensations), being selfish?\n\nI've noticed that especially when we aren't feeling well that our tendency to act selfish increases. It's kind of like that the feeling that is associated with selfishness arises a lot if we don't feel like doing something. It doesn't mean that we act out that feeling, but the desire to act selfish becomes more pronounced. For example if I'm tired and don't FEEL like going to a scheduled appointment I tend to only care about my own feeling of tiredness instead of empathising with the person who I promised to arrive on time.\n\nThere's a lot to learn from Fe-dom people on that one. 
4	I remember thinking about this in my constantly running mind. I realized that functions aren't necessarily selfish because determining whether someone being selfish is highly subjective to their own views. Not to spark any political debate here, but look at the average American's vs. a Trump supporter's views towards Trump. Some people think he's selfish, and others think he's not.\n\nSo instead of looking at some functions as "selfish" or "selfless", look at it as an approach to viewing the world around you. Just because ENFPs typically look through a lens based on their own personal experience, doesn't necessarily make ENFPs selfish. It's just one way of seeing the world around you.\n\nI think it's fair to decide whether someone is selfish or not based on how they use that lens. An ENFP can be selfish when they use their personal experiences to receive attention from others. Conversely, an ENFP can be selfless when they use their personal experiences to guide others to find the best solution to their problems. It's not being ENFP that makes us selfish or selfless, but more so, how we use our ENFP quirks.
1	This is one of the reasons why unhealthy or undeveloped ENFPs come off as being flaky asshats to others. Its also why we are prone to addictive behaviors. We are very selfish about our mood, we really like feeling good and have a tendency to prioritize our experience over others. \n\nThe weird thing is that we also value experiences over our own health or wellbeing, particularly when Si is weakest. If we are trapped in our Ne and Fi loop we are constantly aware of our feelings and concerned with how to make it better. To this extent we then use others to fuel our mood.\n\nHealthy ENFPs value others in their Fi and don't let it drige selfishness. Developed ENFPs have a stronger Te which should also make the person aware of these selfish desires and choose to act based on the logic of "blowing off my friend because im in a bad mood is wrong because xyz" rather than just listening to Fi.
1	You should take a look into shadow functions. They gave me a pretty deep understanding of myself, but I'm not ENFP.. and I came here to learn more about them, so I can't help too much unfortunately 
1	Resentment towards an ex	I am an INTP dating an ENFP for two months. We talk about a lot of things without any filters which helps with insecurities our types carry. Before we got together, she was with a guy who sort of lied and ghosted her till she broke up. The guy still checks in on her (which doesn't bother me). What does bother me is whenever we talk about the guy, she gets angry (not upset). when asked she replied "How dare he do those things to me". It's been two months and she still carries the resentment. Why is this so?
7	Anger toward an ex often means some still has some feelings. Not to say they'd ever get back together, it's just they are not over it. The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference.\n\nAlso 2 months is not much time. It took me over 2 years to get over my ex. In some ways I never will be.
3	Two months is nothing
1	> It's been two months and she still carries the resentment. Why is this so?\n\nDid you mean to say\n\n>It's **only** been two months and she still carries the resentment. Why is this so?
31	Do you guys also have a lot of people that feel close to you? (but you don't feel close to them because of unwillingness to open up)	Hi all! \n  \nSo I just wrote out another post ranting about my current relationship, and while I was typing it out I realized that a lot of people in my life feel emotionally connected to me. Usually what happens is I'm hanging out with someone that I'm not very close with or I've just met with recently. I'm really good at reading people so I can easily sense if something in their life is bothering them (and I can usually tell what it is). I don't want to invade their privacy and push unsolicited advice though, so I'd say something supportive that's related to a situation that we're both involved in right now (maybe class related, club, or whatever), that can also be interpreted as advice to the personal issue that the person is having. For me this is kind of second nature and I do want to help when I recognize that someone is struggling with something. At that point, usually, a new page turns and the person would open up to me about their problem in usually a negative way. Maybe something like "but I'm not going to get that promotion because I'm too shy." I'd listen, provide examples from my life, give advice and motivation. After that, the person always seems relieved and I'm happy I helped someone out. But then they start to initiate interactions with me all the time (inviting me to things, texting me, whatever). I guess from their perspective we are close now? I think that this happens because I listened to them while they were vulnerable, and because I offered examples from my life, they feel like they know about me too, so that makes them feel close to me.\n  \nI love getting to know people and helping them out, but I feel bad that all these people think that they are close to me but I don't feel close to them. It doesn't seem like it from the outside because I talk a lot, but I'm very private and share things that I consider personal to only a select few people. So I think that this goes down to me not being willing to open up, which causes me not to feel close to the people in my life because I don't really feel like they truly know me, even though they might think they do?\n  \nDoes anyone else feel the same way?
10	Ohmygosh YES YES & YES!!! This is my whole life story. People often feel like we reciprocate their level of openness... but we don‚Äôt. And exceptionally few people will actually pick up on that fact. Those few people that recognise that we aren‚Äôt that open are the ones that may eventually become my true friends. Because there is a level of care and reciprocation in that friendship that meant that they actually CONSIDERED you and cared about you enough to analyse if you were being emotionally fulfilled by the friendship too. Find those people and give them your emotional energy instead. Don‚Äôt walk around like a free counselling service, be selective!\n\n\nNo. Of people who call me their close friend: 100,000\nNo. of people I call close friend: 3\n\nLol
8	But don't you all get the irony of this.\nYou all seem to be missing it.\nPerhaps why I don't experience this, because I'm an ENFP that doesn't do this.\n\nYou expressed something personal about yourself and they appreciated it by inviting you out with them, they wanted to build a friendship with you and include and take you to places. You should've gone! üòÅüéâüéâ\nAnd if you go and there's not a great depthful connection there. As much as you seek depth with most of your friendships, consider this, I'm at a point where I'm starting to just enjoy being in places and seeing life, I guess this's another element of my weakest function Si.\nTo go out into the world just enjoying watching life around me. Sometimes it can be too stifling to stay in depth and be SO deep. Trust me, I'm 31 now, I spent a large part of my younger years feeling extremely depressed because I couldn't find caring deep connections in my life, so I shut myself off for years playing single-player videogames, because I was fed up of feeling rejected, when in actual fact, I'd never have been rejected if I didn't have such a huge focus on depth and just went and joined in the "playtime" of socialising.\nAnd yes I get that some socialising can be so vapid, but it's okay to say "Sorry I can't get into this convo, mind if we talk about something else with a huge genuine playful smile on your face". Only a control freak that you don't want as your friend in the first place would get offended by this.\n\nAnd I feel like it's worth asking yourselves, how will you ever feel close to these people if you keep this mentality up.\nI too only have 3 friends, but others are welcome to get close and I don't hold my "secrets" (that many other people also experience btw and, not offensively intended, aren't actually that special in the grand scheme of things, again not offensively, just bring it down to the absolute basics of what's logical in life), I don't bother hold my "secrets" too close to my heart, I don't see the point, otherwise I give them too much importance and it blocks me and others from being truly seen in life.\n\nI prefer now to speak my natural self, give people a dose of my constantly heavy flowing waterfall of saying things on my mind to see if they can handle it(not as heavy flowing as it sounds, but quite heavy hehe) and if they slowly sidestep away because I'm "weird" or not "normal" I find great amusement in that with those whom are just as crazy as me hehe.
6	Okay, yes, but my frustration comes mainly from the fact that I want to be able to open up more with the people I'm close to and trust. Literally tonight I was in an awesome conversation with people I know "get" me and are very supportive and insightful, but when they asked me questions that were too personal, I sort of skirted around the edges and gave them just enough to seem like I was being open... I really just want to spill my guts though, and I hate that I don't. 
3	Yep, very good at sensing both people's problems but also their hopes and dreams. So I get them talking about it because I just like making people happy or find a solution to their problems. I also find common grounds pretty fast. But because of all this, a lot of people latch onto me right away. But like, literally stuck to me even if I barely know them. It's very suffocating, they try so hard while I don't feel comfortable around them at all and they act like they've known me for years which I perceive as fake and insincere. People don't take their time anymore to get to know someone, whether it's friendly or romantically. A few recent examples is this girl I met at a concert, got along great, found common grounds, had good time, etc... Added her on Facebook and she bombards me with texts asking to meet up in her city (which is an hour drive for me + she has no parking so I'd have to pay for it). I'd be willing to do that if I actually knew her longer and better than 1 day. But she would send an sms if I didn't respond on Facebook, did this for a few weeks. I was pretty busy with work and college at the time so it really annoyed the shit out of me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother example is some guys I went on a date with, met and talked via Tinder beforehand but not that much. On the date itself, it was just too much for me. First guy would just stare at me, mouth half open with a smile, just nodding and laughing at EVERYTHING I said. I talked 80% of the time which made me uncomfortable because he didn't talk at all. Tried to kiss me at the end of the date, haha no thanks. Other guy was more laid back and I actually liked the date, but after that via text he sent weird texts, trying to be weird and funny I think, about behadings, rape scenes, etc... I barely know him yet he's that open to me. I have pretty dark sense of humor so maybe he's trying to get to that, but it was waaaaay too soon for that shit. Because I meet people like this, I'm getting more and more closed up to new people I meet because I don't want people to go full in on me again, pretend like they know me and discuss whatever with me. It's not real.
3	YES I feel harassed by those people who think we are friends but we are not !!!\n\nI feel so paradoxical, I like so much the humankind and at the same time I'm so selective with who I open up.
3	Most people in my life. I've only opened up to a few people
2	Yeah, definitely. I think a lot of my friendship conflicts in my life were a result of someone else thinking i was as close to them as they felt to me. Nobody sought revenge or anything but there has definitely been hurt feelings. 
2	Are any of you good at Ti?	I'm wondering how many people here are ENFPs vs. mistyped ENTPs with a lot of emotionality. I also wonder if maybe the Beebe stack is bullshit and the "Point of Least Resistance" isn't necessarily neglected the way most people assume.\n\nReason I'm asking is that I'm *probably* an ENTP with an abnormally high amount of Fi, and I'm wondering if there are any of you with a situation that parallels that. If you suspect I'm a mistyped ENFP myself, I'm willing to listen, but my reasoning process is FAR more reminiscent of Ti than Te, so I would have a LOT of doubts about that.
2	I feel like to a degree, I can use it. I've heard things from two sides, you can use it and you can't, and overall I came up with the idea that it's not as exaggerratted as Beebe makes it, but to an extent it's probably hard to use *initially*. Now I think what most people miss is that, each type is an exaggerrated extreme, you're going to have charecteristics of other types, whatever that may be. I don't believe I can't use Ti, as I feel like my Fi has probably morphed with Ti or Te to make a value system. I feel like my Fi is too rigid and structured when compared to descriptions of Fi, but too loose to be compared to Ti. I'm more loose than I am structured when it comes to Ji(Introverted Judging) functions which is why I relate to ENFP. I can easily tell if I believe a rule is useless, I don't abide by them, and I won't follow them, which would point to Auxilary Ti and that's only one example. I sometimes struggle to believe in absolute truths, but only in areas where I'm not knowledged on, which is both Te and Ti to an extent. Whenever I get ideas I always go under a double process, whether I value the idea(Fi) and whether it makes sense from a logical standpoint(Ti). Of course I could be wrong, and some of the Ti statements may be Te and Fi may be Fe, but from my understanding I relate to both functions. However, I don't use Ti as *consistently* like I do Fi, Ti is probably something I use a few times a day, whereas Fi usually gets priority. If you believe you have high Fi, then believe that, otherwise, MBTI just becomes a horoscope.  
6	I just didn't wanna type it all out again.	
3	What gets me thru is the thought that you can only have a strong spirit by going through hardship. Going through all this is going to shape you into a better more compassionate human being.
1	I cannot really give any advice, all I can say, is that you are doing the right thing reaching out. I hope, some with more experience will send this and give you what I can't. 
1	Wanna chat privately? I'd like to listen to you as I have had such times myself and wanna make you aware that you matter too
1	the info is too little, so you wanna go to US?  so what passport are you having now, I mean you lost it and also because of financial problem you had to go back to ur country? I don't really get it. and try to look some online job if you can't find a job in your country so far? what's your profession?? 
1	No one is a fortune teller. You don't know the future. Tomorrow could be the best day of your life. It might seem unlikely things will get better but they could. And that's a chance to fight for.
1	You are the buck and bronco
3	Esfj's Shallow?	Hellos my fellow Enfp's, am I the only who thinks that Esfj's appear very shallow? (Not to say they are but it seems that way). \n\nTo me it seems that they don't have an own opinion, (Ni) trickster after all, and it seems like that they don't have any really helpful advice that isn't cookie cutter. That's probably also the reason why they get along with a lot of people because their whole Persona is just so cookie cutter. Oh and never ask an Esfj for advice since the most you'll get is stuff that is 08/15 and can be found in almost any magazine. No dept whatsoever. It seriously infuriates me!! I tried repeatedly with several different Esfj to test if there's more to them than the surface level but yet to no avail.\nI think what I refer to as "depth in the Esfj" is linked to their Ti which is their 4th/Inferior function and point of insecurity --> they are afraid to go deep (share what they actually think). \n\nP. S OBVIOUSLY IT'S A MASSIVE SWEEPING GENERALISATION HERE. 
3	There are some people that I try to crack into but nothing works. It's bizarre how intellectually underdeveloped some people can be. Not saying I hate these people, but they're strange to me. At least ESFJs in your life know how to manage their money well
2	Lol yeah no this might just be an individual thing. I (26F ENFP) actually go to my aunt (50 something ESFJ) as my go to advice/guidance counselor on any and all personal and work matters. She actually has the most practical and solution oriented advice that‚Äôs like really aligned with my own personal values. Lol If you just wanted to have an internet rant, then Kay cool. But I just felt the need to speak up here on her behalf cause I have mad respect for her. esfjs can actually be quite useful sounding boards for us, if you cultivate the right relationship with them. When they love, they give all of themselves to the other person. Literally will know me better than myself may times. And she seems to have an uncanny ability to knows the exact right course of action for me to get the results I desire. \nMaybe it‚Äôs a maturity thing, ghat as they grow they become much more aware and differentiated in their own thought? 
2	Im enfp , I think it depends on if they are well- educated / well- experienced.  if they are, then okay they might be a bit "cookie cutter" bcz they follow society rules a lot and never question it. however, shallowness isn't necessarily related, like I said, it has to  depend on they education and experiences. 
7	Anyone else hate corrective people?	I mean when I quote a meme and my best friend has to correct me or interrupt me to do it better. Or when I pronounce a word a certain way and she must tell me that it's wrong because xyz. I mean, words were invented for us to communicate, so why do we have to abide by every single rule that some rando made up, if the purpose doesn't require it?\n\nShe says it in such a snobby manner that it drives my inner psyche nuts. I just wish she'd let me be more free, although she hasn't really been on my ass as much these days, which I suppose is good. I just keep thinking back to those moments which just piss me off. I don't know, I think I value my freedom a lot and I hate when people try to make me feel bad about it - probably because it works. \n\nEspecially since I have other faults, like not super accurate memory (unlike her, which is why it's infuriating that she's snobby about it because she doesn't get that it's rude to flaunt something like that) and also stuttering sometimes or saying something in the wrong way, which she makes fun of, which is fucking stupid. Also, I just don't think that expressing myself has these limits that she imagines. I think that I can remix a meme now and then, and I don't have to say words the exact way some person one day insisted they did.\n\n&#x200B;
3	As much as I love self improvement, I fucking hate perfectionists. Especially the type that lord how much more of a perfectionist they are than you. My co worker is like that and I fucking hate it! She's rude and bossy and demeaning and I don't think she realizes it.\n\nLike, its one thing to have high standards, its another to think you are superior to others BECAUSE you have high standards
2	~~*Urges to correct the MSFW tag intensifies*~~\n\nI would say it's due to your low Si, and your Ti PolR/Blindspot. \n\nAs an INTP that pokes you guys precisely here inadvertently since I'm a Ti-dom I wanna say it's not purpose.\n
1	Thats so relatable  . My bestie is also like that . She corrects me every now and then which drives me crazy inside . I also have inaccurate memory so she corrects me . But I hate it . 
1	Lol, my ENFP husband says things "wrong" on purpose to trigger my "correcting" reflex. His version of trolling, I guess.
1	I'm one of the correctors. Generally, the purpose requires it a lot more than people tend to think. There's a lot of talking which is really ambiguous, and a lot of writing which conjures up some incredibly bizarre images if read as written. Or it simply doesn't make any sense at all, which leads to the impression that the writer can't be trusted to get what they're trying to communicate across.\n\nTrue, in many cases the meaning can, with some time and effort, be figured out, or at least to a certain degree of confidence. But it's the difference between driving a luxury car down a freshly-paved freeway, and riding a skateboard down a rock-strewn gulch. The first one gets you where you want to go in comfort. The second gets you a concussion.\n\nMostly, what I'm trying to do is let people know that yes, there is a difference when you meant to say you helped your Uncle Jack off a horse, but you actually said you helped your uncle jack off a horse.
1	Interestingly enough, I tend to be more similar to the person you talk about in your post as an ENFP. If I know a quote and someone butchers it in a small or big way, I‚Äôll sometimes reflexively correct them (albeit I do my best to do so graciously and make clear my light-hearted intent behind the correction). If I don‚Äôt know a quote and I know I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôll sometimes butcher it anyways and add a disclaimer I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm saying. I think it has a lot to do with my personal values where I find semantics more important than the average person because I feel like for a message to be effectively communicated, everyone needs to be on the same page about what is being said (I think about my past interest in journalism and modern political division). 
22	The Campaigner without a campaign	"Life is so unnerving for a servant who's not serving"-Lumiere\n\nThis is my first time posting on reddit so bare with me. 23M, I still don't know what I want to do with my life and I feel I am running out of time to make a decision. I am about to get married to the most amazing woman and thinking about having children in the next 3-4 years.\n\nBeing an ENFP, I usually considered myself a sprinter in many aspects of my life, always starting something and being deeply motivated until I get tired of it. Now that I have a copilot in life, it pains me to not know where we are going. For all you other ENFP's out there who has made a career for themselves, what was your guiding compass? How did you know(or think you knew) that your career was the right one?
8	Lol I'm 32 and still don't know what I want to do with my life. My mom says she didn't figure it out til she was like 52. Most people when you ask them and they are being honest,  dont know what the hell is going on. It's fine. Embrace it,  or just pick something really. None of this matters. (if someone could please tell me what to do with my life that would be great BTW but I probably still won't do it thanks) 
3	I'm 18 but I think I can help.\n\nI guess you take a career you like, and start following it. I took up freelance writing 2 years ago. Believe me, as an ENFP, I have faced a lot of confusion. \n\nBut remember this: \n\n"the grass on the other side isn't greener"\n\nPassing the initial stage where you're all motivated is easy. The difficult part is the middle one. The middle part is when you feel bored with the task and want to move on. \n\nI went through this phase last year. I thought I should quit writing as it seemed boring and become a salesperson or a coder.\n\nBut you know what I did?\n\nI ignored the quitting thoughts. They keep returning but I ignore them. Believe me, once you have invested enough time in a project, you'll be too proud to give it up. \n\n I can proudly say now that I'm a writer. Feel free to ask any questions. üòä\n\nPS - Don't worry. We all face this confusion at all times. We're always here to help. 
3	19M, I‚Äôm also stressing about this right now. I found out I like filming videos midway through my senior year in High school. So now I find myself, a year later at college studying it, and losing interest in it. I‚Äôm wanting to explore something else entirely different and I just wish I had a way to pick a path and stick to it instead of absolutely selling my soul to an idea for a year and then grabbing a new one a year later.
3	Depends if a career is important. It wasn't to me, just financial stability, earning enough to go on holiday, pay mortgage, raise a family etc\nThe majority of people work to fund the lifestyle they want. Only the lucky few get to do a job they love. \nIt doesn't really matter, as long as you are earning enough and you're not unhappy at work.\n
2	First of all, you're not locked in for the rest of your life with your choice at 23. There is the choice to change. \n\nSecond, I find in these moments it's helpful to remember the actual goal. If it's to provide for family, then just pick something and go from there. Maybe you don't need a profoundly meaningful career if you have profoundly meaningful relationships or side jobs or hobbies. \nIf your ultimate goal is find a meaningfull career, maybe talk about how to finance that discovery together, i.e. she worksa full time and you work a part time for 4 years and then switch when your career is settled so she can be home with kids. Or what ever works. \n\nLastly, just remember you're not in it alone. She is partnering with you for a reason. She wants to see you succeed and she wants to build life together. Don't try to save everything alone and don't decide it alone. Make sure you're communicating your thoughts/feelings AND listen to her responses. \n\nYou're gonna do great. :) 
6	ENFP Productivity	How many of you struggle with routines/productivity outside of your employment/phone addictions? Is it just me? As an ENFP, I feel like my distractibility is HIGH! Add in a phone and it is so hard to stay on task! Was there an age when you suddenly got it together or are you still working on it, like me? Lastly, are there any productivity books or resources that really helped you?
4	I don't think we have to get it all together. One of the awesome things about the way ENFP's think is that it is slightly all over the place. That's ok though. We have a million thoughts going through our heads all the time. Learn to embrace the fluidity. It's the thing that makes us great. 
4	I struggled with this, I found a few apps that helped. Might as well circumnavigate the problem by using the device I've been sinking a tonne of time into to inform me and help me control my vrry phone usage.\n\n(I'm now becoming a frequent user of these reddits so this defo not an advert, just useful info)\n\nThere's an app called 'Anti-social' which tracks how much you're opening your phone and how much you're using apps, both social and general. It's about how we let our phone exacerbate anti-social tendencies by like enabling us to zone out of life and losing ourselves in our phone. Like it's okay to do this, but not if we start doing it to the detriment of socialising at all. Like I was doing.\n\nAnother app basically drastically improves the results being recorded on anti-social.\nIt's called 'Off the grid'. This one locks your phone for a set time and you have to pay their company to unlock it within this timeframe that *you've* set yourself.\nSooo useful in helping regain some self-control and reduce the subtle psychologically bssed phone addiction that we all teach ourselves to have via picking a phone up whenever nothings happening, instead of enjoying the moment or talking to a close friend or family member.\n\nWe as individuals and as a species are losing so much precious time in life and with loved ones due to getting sucked into our phones.\nLike I theorise that there's many people feeling lonely who wouldn't if they put their phone down and turned to talk with the person sitting next to them in a coffee shop.\nTry it, maybe you'll find a new friend that you start having friendship based coffee-dates with.
3	28 and still don‚Äôt have it together whatsoever 
2	36 and finally improving my productivity, only at work though! I tell my boss what I'm going to do that day, then of course it has to get done because i've promised! Accountability is my biggest motivator.
29	Need to get me one of you guys ‚ô•Ô∏è	I‚Äôve typed as INFJ and naturally looked at some of the soulmate types and after browsing this sub for a little while I definitely agree ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nYou all sound so lovely! I wish I didn‚Äôt have social anxiety so I could increase my chances. Anyone male and in Canada? Lol 
11	I'm an ENFP (male but not in Canada). If you're looking for an ENFP guy, don't worry, we are easy to approach. Just look for a guy who talks a lot, talks with passion and doesn't hesitate to talk. :)\n\n&#x200B;
5	We are pretty cool! üòúüòò Jokes *tries to hide inner nerd*
5	Where in Canada? I‚Äôm male and in Montreal/nova scotia 
4	PICK ME, PICK ME, PICK ME! üòòüòâ
3	I'm an ENFP with an INFJ girlfriend, and I am so happy with the way our relationship is! Alcohol was a great help for meeting each other so I think I could recommend that haha. We met at a fantasy festival.

50	working remotely, feeling disconnected	Any other ENFP's work the corporate life and work remote? I can go into a local office but most of my team is 3 hours time difference away, so I feel pretty disconnected from them. Many of our interactions are on web video conferences, and people tend to be pretty buttoned up. I find it very draining from my playful nature. Any of you have strategies for dealing with this? \n\nWhen I am not busy I use the time at home to enjoy creative pursuits and focus a bit more on home life. But I miss work camaraderie and feeling a part of the team. The corporate BS is weighing on me lately.
12	I‚Äôm in this position. Wfh with a few days a week in office, at my discretion. However I love it. I play with my dogs or clean during breaks. I try to do a Pomodoro style deal, so 20 on 5 minute break method, with a 15-20 minute break twice a day. Though it‚Äôs not actually that rigid. \n\nI use my breaks to play my guitar, brainstorm for a kids book, or side consulting business, or....as now....browse reddit. \n\nIt‚Äôs not quite as social obviously, but it‚Äôs productive usually!\n\nAlso consider working at a coffee shop or bar with WiFi. You could also consider a coworker space usually used by entrepreneurs, but that will cost at least 2-3 hundred a month for a desk much less an office 
5	Wish I had some advice to give you, but I was in the same position until recently.  I could easily work from home with my old jobs, but I hated it.  I'm much happier now that I'm leading a team and have people to interact with on a daily basis.  I would also be interested if anyone has any advice!
5	I wanted to add. One thing I have been doing is writing in my notebook some jokes or observations of all the corporate bullshit. The dream is to turn it into a webcomic or something. Channel it into an outlet.
3	Took a few months to get used to working from home. I have to make a conscious decision to hang out with friends outside of work hours so I don‚Äôt go to crazy. Lol. 
3	I work remote; actually not quite - I'm local and work out of a home office, and I am the only employee (pastor of a small church). I see my folk throughout the week, but that pastoral connection is quite different from the friend/open connection. As a relationally driven ENFP, this makes me both bonkers and sad. To this end, we have different friends over for dinner once a week, I have coffee with one or two peers (folk not in my church) once a week, try to go hiking with friends on the weekends, and most importantly - make space to process my thoughts and emotions. \n\nIf you can't make space, try time-blocking (google it - the roadwarrior blog has a great write-up). If that doesn't work, I highly recommend finding a good therapist who can help you work through some of your sh*t and help you construct some useful coping strategies. Paying for a therapist is a good way to make sure it happens. \n\nAs far as in-work time strategies, etc. I second the comment to do lots of your work in coffee shops and libraries. I find I'm most productive in those places. Second, video-conferences can be stoic, so - make sure you're in a nice place, I've done several at city parks using my hotspot for connection. Also, dress the part you want to play; if you have to wear a shirt and tie, pick something fun like polkadots; if you can wear whatever, pick something a tad silly to provoke a reaction and break the ice with your colleagues. It also doesn't hurt to say - "hey, folks, this isn't a job review! Let's all relax a bit - remember, work is what you make it!"\n\nEither way, best to you. You're certainly not alone in this.
3	I went through the same thing when I moved and stopped working! I thought it was going to be great to not work! It was not. I loved my co-workers and working with the public and to lose all of that all of a sudden was very hard. It‚Äôs going on 6 years and I still miss them and the feeling of being a part of a team every day. For me, it got easier over time and with the understanding that I thrived on those interactions and in that environment. Hobbies and being creative helps provide an outlet, too. And puppies. 
3	I feel you on this. I was just snowed in for a week and worked from home. I almost lost my mind. We need social interaction because that‚Äôs where we really shine. 
3	Yes.  But maybe for a different reason. I work in IT and we use Microsoft Teams to collaborate and connect. Especially with a sprawling campus and many buildings across town. We embrace the remote worker. \n\nMy issue was not having water cooler conversations and work friends.... I worked remote as a consultant for 10 years. Traveled a lot for the first 5 but for the past 4 years just worked from home. It was sooo hard on me. I looked for friends to have chats with about the kind of stuff you talk about in the office. I started relying heavily on the internet for adulting ‚Äúhow to‚Äôs‚Äù because I didn‚Äôt have anyone to watch in action or learn from contextually. I was isolated from humans. I needed hallway conversations and office cake!! I needed to learn and grow!!! \n\nI couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. Last fall I swapped the comfort of wearing yoga pants and napping at lunch for a 1.5 hour daily commute and it has changed my life for the better in so many ways. \n\nIf you‚Äôre already realizing the disconnect / gap, start preparing for change. You already know you need it. 
3	I am a freelance digital marketer. As a result, I don't work in teams, and I work remotely & alone 100% of the time. In fact, I've never met my primary client & source of income in person. Even crazier, we've literally called *twice* on the phone. All other correspondence is via Email. \n\nAnd you know what? I couldn't be happier than ever. Working remotely is AWESOME, **but you're doing it completely wrong.** \n\nHowever, I understand because for the past month I've helped a friend's agency grow and leading the team & getting recognition in person was awesome! But, it didn't allow me freedom so I'm not continuing with bullshit like commutes & office distractions. \n\nMy guess is that you're living the exact same life you had POST remote that you had BEFORE remote, and that's just SO wrong friend. You are abusing your great freedom! \n\nWhy not work in a coffee shop? Meet some other regulars and share small talk & stories on mutual breaks. In my favorite coffee shop, 5 of us will often sit on the same table and share jokes & conversation between work. We all work remotely. \n\nWhy not travel? You can see the world and work remotely! In the past 2 years I've traveled to 12 (or more) countries. In fact, I loved one so much I'm currently working on moving back there. Woot woot! See /r/DigitalNOmad for more info. \n\nWhy not get pets? Play with your pets. \n\nWhy not work more efficiently? **SECRET:** The average person works 1.5-2 hours per day, not 8 hours. Focused work is so different than unfocused work, which most people are stuck in. By working remotely, NO ONE can watch you! \n\nFigure out how to go into "flow states" and be super efficient. You can then work 2 hours per day, and enjoy the rest of the day. Hello, hobbies! Hello, coffee meet-ups! Hello, new social circles! I shall add that you should probably pretend to be online though, and respond to messages within an 8 hour period :P \n\nIt sounds to me like too much of your social fulfillment was achieved through work... no offense but I'm going to be BRUTALLY honest: that's SAD. Unfortunately that's a NORM in America (I'm guessing you're American/Canadian?). So now that you're working remote, a big part of your social life was pulled out under you. \n\nYou need to start meeting people for breakfast. Create a work-out group for the mornings. Get lunch with people. Hangout every evenings with friends. \n\nI LOVE working remote because my life gets to be more of a celebration.... HOWEVER IF YOU DO IT WRONG IT CAN BE A LONELY HELL. And you friend are doing it wrong, otherwise you'd be posting bragging of how amazing remote work is. \n\nSo do some research, and really ask yourself how you can be more social in your life. Being remote is 1,000x better than in-office. You can travel the world (see /r/DigitalNomad), work less, and live life on YOUR terms. But if you're doing it wrong it'll fuck you up with isolation. \n\nI shall add that I've done it wrong before... so I get you. That's how I know. Anyone who isn't loving remote work is doing it wrong because remote work simply gives you more freedom. Most people just don't know how to use that freedom to make themselves happy. \n\nWhat would make you happy? And, don't you dare say go back into the office, because there are better options and I believe that you can find them! 
1	ENFP and narcissism/histronic pd	Is there a correlation? Are they related in some way?
9	Don't think so, ENFP's are imo one of the most selfless people who sacrifice their own feelings and time to please the people they care about. I do get selfish at times when I feel like I'm falling back into depression because of certain people having a negative impact on me or if I want to become happier but that's it. What makes you think there's a correlation? Because we have a dramatic flair sometimes and like attention? I gotta admit, that's true in my case but I've also studied psychology and narcissism and histrionic pd is something very extreme and completely different. People suffering from those have 0 regard for how other people feel. That's certainly not the case with ENFP's. 
9	Oh crap, I'm falling for someone again	Welp, what I thought was just going to be a hookup and my mind is telling me that this guy is not a good fit for me because we're so different and probably going on different life paths etc. After getting my heart really, really broken, I told myself that I really needed to be more careful this time. But he is the most caring and sweet man I have ever hooked up with and his personality is just so sexy. Even last night I was really guarded but I woke up this morning and couldn't concentrate on my work and the buildings all look different when I walk outside and I've been thinking about him all day and oh god I think I'm falling for someone all over again. 
12	One of the reasons I don't recommend hookups is that you release binding hormones during the act which are very likely to create feelings for a person that shouldn't normally arise.
2	YESSSSSSSSS. I am in the same boat, It's been a week with several hookups, and I just find myself like....uh oh....I have been thinking of this person all day....I've caught, the feels.
2	I'll tell you this, if you are acting broken hearted, and that this time you are looking for something different, then you will find exactly that.\n\nI don't like the term falling for someone, because that always ends up the same way, it's teenage love-infatuation. And if you're into that, then that's fine, we all have our own paths. ENFP or not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI still for that myself too, it's nice. But that's about it, I don't bother with whether it can work or not, logistically. But I am looking for a soul-connection, for that un-conditional love, that you just click and understand each other so deeply, you're not looking for anything out of each other. This lets you be more open than ever, more you than ever. Is it exciting? Yes, but not because someone is finally paying attention to me. It's exciting because of the continues unraveling of the mystery.
1	This is why I don‚Äôt do hookups
5	Should ENFP Focus On Only Doing One Thing At A Time?	
3	I like your approach on this and agree that it's possible to work on more than one thing at time as long as we're able to focus on each of them properly. I've always been able to work on two , three (sometiimes more)  areas of interest at a time and still be successful at them in my life. I would also feel like I was more productive and focused during that period because I was working on different projects at once. It drives me. (ENFP Female, here)
14	Do you all ever feel like you want to change your appearance often?	Currently I wanna change my hair again, maybe cut it, dye it, who knows. Also want to pierce my ears more. I shift through these thoughts/ impulses often and sometimes carry them out. Anyone relate?
6	Yes I do have this feeling quite often but I almost never do anything because I know that I will regret it in few days.
5	This seems to be a very common theme amongst ENFPs. My ex-gf changed her hair color a lot. And I noticed this from other ENFPs online and now, in this thread.\n\nI wonder why that is.
3	Yes. I'm considering a medium size tattoo, dying my hair for the first time a cherry/chocolate color, I loooove watching glam makeup tutorials and want to start incorporating some of it, I like "ugly fashion" and menswear-inspired fashion... Being unable to just buy things on a whim has helped to curb my impulses but those are the ones I've been coming back to several times every year. 
2	YES. I actually had a fabulous hair color journey last year, first it was blue/purple, then blue, then a mix of red, purple, blue, pink, then blue again, then now it's purple. Any suggestions of a hair color I should try next? :3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been wanting to get a Tattoo spontaneously as well, in the near future.\n\nI've also gotten a lip piercing and nose piercing out of the blue one day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy am I like this?
2	I'm gonna dye my hair red tonight! I think I'm trying different things to find my perfect style though, not just for the sake experimentation - but I might be an unusual ENFP. 
2	I used to in my 20‚Äôs but now leave it alone for the most part. I‚Äôm a Mom and I really value looking similar to my daughters to show them they‚Äôre adorable just the way the are so I try to keep my hair mostly the same color as theirs. 
2	Yeah, constantly. A little more difficult as a dude that works in an office though. 
1	Yes, but I am losing my hair so I can't.

1	Starting to despise long-distance SO for texting me too often	Hi all! \n  \n**Warning: I have ADHD so this huge wall of text probably has a ton of unnecessary details and run-on sentences. Also it's mostly just a rant. Enjoy!**\n  \nSo I posted this on r/relationship_advice but everyone there kind of criticized me for wanting to be in a relationship but preferring less texting throughout the day so I thought I'd post here too to see what you guys think!\n  \nSo I met a guy on Tinder in August whose hometown is where I go to college, but he goes to college like 5 hours away. So we probably connected when I came back for the fall semester before he had left, but we matched after his semester had started too. (Might be relevant to add that I'm 20F sophomore, and he's 18 and a freshmen.) \n  \nWe got to talking and started texting each every now and then. At one point, he shared something personal with me and I guess he was surprised by how good of a listener I am and how I was able to I guess comfort him. I guess that made him feel connected with me and maybe kind of emotionally dependent? \n  \nAround October, he asked me out for the first time. I thought about it and ultimately decided that I wasn't comfortable with a long-distance relationship and also because I didn't have very strong feelings for him considering we hadn't met in person yet at that point. We decided to just stay friends and continued to occasionally text each other. \n  \nA few weeks later, he was coming back to his hometown (again, where I go to school) for the weekend, and we ended up spending some time together (no hook-up for anything). Right after, he dropped me off, he texted me saying that he loved being around me, etc, etc and asked me out again. Again, I as kindly as possible said no because, even though I did kind of like him from that first impression, I did not want a long-distance relationship. \n  \nWe decided that we have a good friendship going and it's worth it to keep it that way. And after that, he came back multiple times where we would hang out and do random things.\n  \nWe kept texting occasionally and we'd hang out when he was in town. Now in December, his semester ended earlier than mine, so we were able to hang out before I went back home for break. Then we didn't see each other for about a month until I came back to college and we hung out then. After which, he asked me out for maybe the 3rd or 4th time. In total, we have probably seen each other 5 times in person. But I decided that I did like spending time with him (I think it's because he's introverted and is kind of closed off like an intj, and I kind of like that in people I'm in a relationship with, but I don't think he's an intj) and decided to give it a try and said yes. \n  \nAfter that, he went back to school and we haven't seen each other in person in maybe 2 weeks. And here's the part that's making me start to despise him: he started texting me 4-5 times a day! I wouldn't mind that at all if I'm having a conversation with someone and in that case, I would take a few hours to finish whatever I'm doing and then respond to whoever. That's not what's happening though. For literally 5+ times a day, he would text me "Heyy" or sometimes "Heyy! What's up" I usually respond with something that might provoke a conversation (describe in detail a cool project I'm working on for a club or something like that, and I would ask him what he's doing. No joke, most than half the time his answer is "just chillin" If not that it's some else that doesn't really tell me anything like "doing homework" "just got done with practice "woke up from a nap" "working on a project" etc. \n  \nNow, I really value my time and I'm really involved in my campus and community, and at first I was happy that he was texting me, but now I just feel like I'm having my time wasted and the interactions we're having aren't very fulfilling for me. I'm having to stop what I'm doing to give him the attention that he deserves and then I feel disappointed because I don't see a point to the exchange we just had. \n  \nI used to try to ask him questions to try to get him to talk more like "tell me about the project" and continue asking more questions about the said project and most responses would be similar to the "just chillin" type. Sometimes I'd hit the right question and he'd send me a huge wall of text, which is what I'd like to see! But this doesn't happen often and I don't feel like I have the energy to always have to carry the conversation.\n  \nAt this point, I get really (really) annoyed when I see a "heyy" from him and usually ignore it for a few hours until I feel mentally ready for the ordeal that follows. I know I shouldn't feel that way because I know that he just cares a lot about me or whatever, but I can't stand it anymore.\n  \nI want to break up with him because it's gotten to the point where I despise him (idk why I feel this way, I feel horrible) and I don't think my feelings would change even if I communicated my feelings with him. Also, I would prefer to have that conversation in person, and I'm not going to see him until around May.\n   \nI'm not sure how to approach breaking up with him because he's said that he loves me (and I can tell that he means it) and he sometimes drunkenly sends a wall of text to me friday nights with things like "you're the best thing to happen to me." \n  \nThis was mostly a rant because I was trying to study for a midterm and I again got interrupted by a "Heyy"\n  \nThank you for reading if you made it this far!
2	I think he is really into you and wants to keep you! He‚Äôs 18 so you gotta remember hes not experienced with handling people but im guessing its this texting effort that either really likes you and wants to keep you by doing what he thinks will make you feel like he cares or he is in need of your comfort. But when texts come in a mass all that can mean is you are on his mind and he is happy to tell you something even if it is a personal opinion/ rant hes just happy to know that you are on the other side! I know its really hard to read through everything all the time but that doesnt mean you have to acknowledge him for everything he says just know that he is trying to commit. Just my opinion 
1	You should confront him about how you feel about his texting. It might not change the way you feel but that's not the main point. The point is to respect how you feel and communicate openly about an issue that's important to you. You will probably learn a lot from how he reacts to this and it'll help you make a more informed decision rather than your current situation of not knowing what to do.
1	I think you could just break up, some people just never gonna get interested in what u r doing, u know. and there are just people who never like a deep conversation , they just like to say nonsense but fun or chill. like I had a friend like that, its really hard to discuss anything serious with him, and he texted me everyday to just ask me "what u doing" "I'm bored""wanna hang out"......he was my neighbor.  then really, I got tired fast. I didn't care if he was bored or not, if he was chatty and wanted some companion, fine , then "engage a real conversation, dude!" he is a nice person but doesn't mean I can be his very good friend.
7	about enfps being weird	discuss in the comments, for me weird its a compliment
13	normal is a far greater insult than weird. I suppose only if weird is socially isolating, it would hurt. otherwise being called weird is almost like a confirmation that I'm on the right track haha.
4	And what is normal anyway? If weird is synonymous with 'not being average' then let me be weird.
461	ENFPs Give So Much	
110	The level of uncomfortable accuracy is high with this one. \n\nWhy is it so hard to be nice to yourself so freaking hard? 
31	Man, this hit home. I‚Äôve been watching my sister‚Äôs kids for the last three days since she had to have an emergency C-Section and both her and her new baby are stuck in the hospital (he‚Äôs a month early). I don‚Äôt mind, but after I get done watching them today (their dad wants to give me a break) the rest of my family wants me to go down to a city an hour and a half away to have dinner with them for Valentine‚Äôs Day. But I‚Äôm so drained from watching a 5 and 3 year old that I know I need some me time away from people. When I told my family this, they immediately tried to convince me otherwise. I felt so bad for telling my family no, that instead I told them I would think about it. I feel so bad wanting to spend a day for myself, but I know I‚Äôm so emotionally exhausted that even the slightest inconvenience will set me off crying. I really hate the side of me that needs to please people. It leaves so little room for me to remember to love myself. And then, guilt sets in because I feel so selfish. Then that guilt turns into anger at myself. It‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt win!
24	Have you took care of an ENFP today?  Make sure they get their walk, their praise, have you feed an ENFP today?
19	That was a critical hit :o
10	I am super nice to my ENFP best friend, she really appreciates words of affirmation. Makes her glow and be very happy.\n\nEspecially about her appearance. It helps that as an ENTJ I almost never say things I don't mean, so people can trust my compliments.

3	I got bullied a lot when I was young, so I appeared more introverted and in that time I hated others and myself.\nIt took years to recover from all of the social judgements of that time that I'm just now becoming much more friendly, but it was through this hard process that before I've started being more friendly and positive that I've already discovered myself. The self-love is much stronger now and I feel worthy of love and belonging, but I also have standards on behaviour I'm willing to put up with.\n\nBelieve me when I say this, you are worth love and you already are loved.\n\nI MUST RECOMMEND! GOING AND WATCHING BRENE BROWN'S TED TALK CALLED The power of vulnerability.\nIt'll lead you to some interesting places. I broke down crying because if it.
2	I‚Äôm just a token INFJ . I‚Äôm not going to explain what it‚Äôs like because you ENFPs truly know what it‚Äôs like and are explaining yourselves brilliantly. What I will say is simple and true.\n\nYou ENFPs are awesome! üíïüíïüíïüíïüíï
2	Me. I tell my boyfriend he‚Äôs amazing practically everyday.
2	Basically it's a facade. It's not giving 'so much' but an emotional projection of insecurities and ultimately running away from yourself and your emotions. It's a horrible cycle where the more you do the shittier you feel.\n\nYou need to carefully choose who you give your time and energy to otherwise you will find yourself exhausted as you get older.\n\nIt Took me near enough 15 years to stop being the energetic and empathetic saviour of everybody. It's impossible and it leaves you feeling hollow and emotionally exhausted because you are relying on others to fill a void, and as you get older the people who didn't care anywhere near as much as you did will move on as life does which causes alot of hurt, more self doubt and ultimately huge self loathing.\n\nTry and find the people you truly care about and give them 'so much' and calm down 'giving so much' to the masses because (from my experience) emotions, like physical energy, time, money etc, need to be rationed. \n\nYou can still bounce off the walls and be the life and soul, but it's the emotional connection and sacrifice of time and effort that creates the spiral of self loathing and inability to self care.\n
2	It's accurate because it's true. Remember, a lot of ENFPs / 7's on the Enneagram have their personalities as a defensive mechanism from processing internal emotion; in Bren√© Brown's system - we're afraid that if people knew who we were on the inside, then no one would like us - so we avoid that internal struggle by pursuing externalities, but then, after we've accomplished everything, we hit frame 6 of the cartoon. That means that we give and give and give and chase and pursue and look for all the shiny things - and we find them everywhere else, because that's what we're looking for; then we go home and look at ourselves and see that none of those things are there. So then we get sad; then to avoid that sadness, we go looking for the next shiny thing. The challenge, and one that I'm not particularly good at, is realizing that the beautiful stuff we see in others, also resides in us. So go, chase the beautiful and exciting - but instead of doing it to escape who you are, do it because of who you are: someone who is also beautiful and exciting and is just searching for the compliment to themselves.

1	I think I‚Äôm feeling sensitive, this made me cry. 
1	I was stuck in this for a long time. I still fall into it often, but at least I no longer live there. The way out was long and tedious, and the first step was an increased awareness of my many opportunities to choose a response. When I started to really pay attention to all the moments I had a CHOICE about how to respond, I could apply the truth rather than giving my feelings too much authority over me. And, being a Christian, praying and memorizing Bible passages that explained how God sees me were also vital for me. Gotta chuck the lies and REPLACE them with truth.  \n\nLike I said, I still get tripped up plenty often, but I know what's happening now and I know I have the option to reject what my feelings say, if they prove to be irrational/harmful. It has made all the difference. 
1	Can I cry with someone
1	An accurate portrayal 
55	Dear ENFPs	I want to stay in tonight with you, put on Footie Pajamas, watch retro 70‚Äôs cartoons, and eat Fruit Loops in a sexy way. \n\nHappy Valentine‚Äôs Day\nLove a fellow ENFP\n
8	Basically my evening, cheers ‚ù§Ô∏è
6	Which is what I did despite my family expecting me for dinner tonight...mind you, they had not told me we were doing family dinner tonight so...I stayed home, even after their call ( felt a bit guilty,  but it passed)
4	No shit, tonight my date and I got really baked and watched bugs bunny while eating fruity pebbles in the sexiest way. For once a decent Valentine's. 
5	I want somebody to talk to that has discovered themselves as deeply as I have
3	90s cartoons is where it's at.
3	I know this is late but I opted for a long nightgown, I watched Hey Arnold!, and I ate microwavable DiGiorno pizzas that I cooked in the oven. They were stuffed crust. I have no regrets. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHappy Day-After-Valentine's Day, OP!
2	As an INTJ, that sounds quite pleasant.üòå
5	An ENFP hates me for what I am.	He is a colleague. He is an ENFP through and through. Bubbly, dreamy, energetic, etc. He used to be nice to me. I introduced him to many MBTI quizzes and they all said ENFP.\n\nHe is good at reading people. He started asking me unpleasant, scoping questions like ‚ÄúHave you ever asked a girl out‚Äù which could mean one of the two things. That I am too shy or that I am gay. I had a hunch that it was the second. I just told him I am gay. He stopped talking to me.\n\nHe is politically very liberal but also thinks feminism is disgusting. I guess it is one of his values to hate gay people? \n\nI feel okay because it‚Äôs his opinion. I‚Äôm just a bit stunned because other ENFPs have been totally cool about this topic. I guess every ENFP is different.
12	Wow, what an asshole!! That is so judgmental. What on earth does your sexuality have to do with him ... God, that annoys me! Here, you‚Äôre free to let go of the burden of any uncomfortable emotions when you‚Äôre around him. I‚Äôll despise him long distance for the both of us. \n\nAnd you know what, you‚Äôre a beautiful person that deserves to be surrounded by good, warmhearted people!
8	Don't let it bring you down, he sounds like an asshole. Just let him out of your life.\n\nI'm an ENFP and a conservative and I can't care less about people being gay. People should be able to love whomever they want to love. Your sexual orientation or gender expression do not matter to me. One of my friends is gay and he is one of the nicest guy I've ever met. 
3	> He is politically very liberal but also thinks feminism is disgusting.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm hardly a model for fully understanding and respecting the troubles of women in society, but to just write off feminism as a whole as "disgusting" shows this guy is an asshole regardless of his personality type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd as I've noted here before, I am an ENFP, but I also was/am an asshole sometimes.\n\n&#x200B;
3	We ENFPs can be quick to judge and stubborn in our viewpoints. What those viewpoints are depend on our environment, upbringing and mental health. I'm sorry this guy was mean to you and generally doesn't sound like a good guy for treating you differently. 
2	Maybe he‚Äôll find the way to apologize or regret it in the future for having been an asshole. Maybe, of course.
17	Are we magnets for crazy people?	Not sure if this is common with ENFPs or if this is just me, but crazy people seem to be drawn to me. \n\nI end up in weird conversations all the time. Sometimes I initiate things (I love talking to strangers) sometimes they do. Either way, it often gets weird real quick.\n\nToday I met a lady outside my doctor's office and gave her a ride to her apartment. She then stayed in my car in the parking lot of her complex for thirty minutes telling me her whole life story and going on some weird religious/numerology rant about how her son is the reincarnation of Jesus and the world is going to end in May 2026. Then she sang to me and told me she hasn't had sex in 14 years. I sneakily texted my mom to call me so I could fake a family emergency and get the hell out of there.\n\nThing is, this isn't the first time something like this has happened, although it is the craziest/scariest/funniest conversation I've had with a stranger.\n\nIs this a common problem for ENFPs?
15	I'd like to think the opposite.  \nInstead of ENFP's being a magnet to crazy people.  \nENFP's are attracted to crazy people. (Not necessarily romantic).
11	We are just the type of people that allow people to let their crazy out around us. \n\nEveryone is crazy in some way. \n\nShut it down, don‚Äôt think about it as rude. 
4	Maybe? I like to think of it as being open to people, which is sort of good and bad at the same time. People I just met or barely know tell me things I'm sure they don't tell anyone else--health issues, personal stuff--it's nuts. Maybe we just bring that out of people, maybe we exude some sort of welcoming/non-judgmental vibe.\n
3	> gave her a ride to her apartment\n\nYou just helped a random person who needed your help\n\n> thirty minutes telling me her whole life story\n\nwell, you learned something new and listened to some weird story, I suppose. Isn't it awesome?\n\n> Is this a common problem for ENFPs?\n\nI wouldn't define it a _problem_, it's just that you met and helped a _different_ person, and you got a nice story to tell to your friends, and maybe laugh at it as a funny anecdote ;-)\n\nI remember 20 years ago, when I was in London, living mostly like an hobo (I had a job, but I had to save money to buy the ticket to come back in my country, so my diet was mostly plain water and white bread, sleeping in the parks, without a bed). I was sitting on a bench in the park, when a rastaman from Jamaica asked me for some tobacco to roll a cigarette. I gave him a pinch of it, then suddenly he said: "well, if you give me some more tobacco, I will roll a joint!". Yeah, why not? So we started smoking his joint, and started talking about politics (he even knew some embarassing italian politician names from the 80's!). After some minute, another weird person comes in. He was from Greece, but the weird thing was that he claimed to dream poems in italian (WHAT !? He didn't speak italian!), then started reading some of his handwritten italian poems from a small notebook. It was a very funny and weird experience, but as you can see, this lasted in my memory until today, and I'm still laughing at it :-)
3	Yes.  I tend to attract self absorbed people.  It's because we love learning about people we meet and show a lot of interest intially.  They soak that shit up.
2	Yes, I have a friendly face so tend to get people like that coming up to me. The ENFP in me loves a mad conversation and I just encourage them. Haha\nNever thought about it till you mentioned it!
2	Crazy people love me. <3
2	i try to live an interesting life and I do think that in doing so interesting people are drawn to me. In part because I'm comfortable around "crazy" people overall, but yeah sometimes something happens which makes me sortof panic for my safety like "this person is really off their rocker".\n\nI don't think its a problem. I'd 100% rather interact with a stranger who is crazy than one who is the most boring and dull square around. most crazy people just want to be heard anyway. 
2	Happens to me all the time - I think it's because ENFPs are subconsciously in tune with others and we create a safe space for a variety of personality types. Sometimes this non-judgemental hospitality is awesome, other times it opens the door to emotional vampires.
2	Well, I attract depressed people who are in need of advice. I‚Äôd rather have the crazy ones every now and then. Let‚Äôs switch places.
2	Help!!!! I am an ENFP and my ISFJ bff is my roomate I love her but I am having problem!	SO My friend will always ask me where I go when I will get back sometimes even waits for me. Other times she will follow me to friends rooms or look for me in the intire dorm and once she find me walks in and stays for a good while. And each night she would Raanttt about everyone she and I know and are friends with and would say bad things. And if she is not doing this she would cry or get super anxius and keep me up almost every night. I moving out and now she is doing crazy things and I frankly dont know what to do!!!!???
4	It sounds like she is having a problem not you. 
2	Man, I divorced from an ISFJ, she had (also) that kind of attitude and I can understand how do you feel :-/\nI think that relationships with ISFJs aren‚Äôt so easy for these and many other aspects of their personality. ISFJs are wonderful people, but their needs can literally consume a ENFP.
1	My mom‚Äôs an ESFJ, and my ex also an ESFJ (needless to say, it didn‚Äôt last long). I can see resemblances with how your friend is acting.\n\nThey both asked me all the time where I was going, with whom, how long and when I would be back. Avoiding or not answering would bring about other problems and discussions.\n\nI feel like its their dependency that‚Äôs acting out, which we feel like an invasion of privacy and, ultimately, find extremely annoying. Given that she‚Äôs an Introvert maybe the dependency is acting out even more since she can‚Äôt easily find friends for herself?\n\nAnyway, since you are best friends, I think you should probably bring these things up and discuss them before it‚Äôs too late. You should make her understand that even though you are really good friends, you also need some time by/for yourself and that it‚Äôs not healthy to do everything together -> about the following around the dorm issue. It‚Äôs healthy to have other friends as well. Also, you should make her understand that you are there for her but unless it‚Äôs a huge problem, you both need sleep in order to function properly the next day. Maybe help her find a way to relax before night comes so she doesnt get anxious and end up crying? As a friend, she should also care about you being tired and needing sleep. We sometimes give a lot, I do the same with friends, but we also need to think about ourselves, and friends should be able to understand.\n\nAlso, keep in mind, this will not be an easy talk, and she might even have a tendency to guilt trip you. At least ESFJs have. But talking it out is better than keeping it in.
1	Is Jacob Barnett an ENFP?	If you aren't familiar with Jacob Barnett, he's a math and science prodigy known for challenging Einstein's theory of relativity.\n\nInitially, he seems like the last thing I would think of when I think of an ENFP, but someone from this site [http://cognitivetype.boards.net/thread/190/typing-intellectual-celebrities](http://cognitivetype.boards.net/thread/190/typing-intellectual-celebrities) has been claiming that he might be one.\n\nI'll copy and paste the comment here:\n\n*Jacob Barnett is Ne/Si + Te/Fi, perception-lead. In the vid you posted* (My edit: which is not visible for some kind of copyright reason it seems) *he seems more SiTe. But..* [*From this*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq-FOOQ1TpE) *and* [*this*](http://cognitivetype.boards.net/thread/190/typing-intellectual-celebrities) *I'm leaning toward* ***NeFi.***\n\nNow, I'm not great at typing people, so I don't really have much to say about this, but yea, I can see that. He definitely seems like a Te user because of his ability to teach and explain things in ways that are understandable to an audience without the same level of technical knowledge (which you can see a lot of on [Jacob Barnett's Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/mathboysmom/videos).)\n\nI dunno, maybe he is just a very non-stereotypical ENFP. What do you think? (You can look for more videos of him by searching "Jacob Barnett" on YouTube if you have to.)
2	Most ENFP's are  non-stereotypical ENFPs.
13	People that annoy us	I keep reading that ENFPs ‚Äúgets along with everyone‚Äù , and to an extent I can say that about myself. \nBut there are times when I honestly can‚Äôt stand how a person acts , not that they‚Äôre mean but how they talk, what they say , how they act. And I feel GUILTY for doing so. \n\nToday I went to dinner with a coworker and the entire time , he wouldn‚Äôt shut up , didn‚Äôt get certain social cues , said the rudest things and I had to end dinner early or I was going to cuss him out in the middle of the restaurant. (Also I went to dinner with him cuz I THOUGHT I liked him , but when I got to know him this of course changed ) \n\nAny of you guys feel guilty for being annoyed with someone? 
15	Yes. I am able to get along with most everyone, but that is not the same thing as enjoying their company. \n\nI am a master at politely excusing myself. \n
7	Yes, it definitely happens. Then I remind myself hat I am a human being, after all, so I'm entitled to not like some people and try not to dwell on it too much. 
6	I always feel guilt when I experience a feeling I consider the least inappropriate. Being annoyed when I should be kind,  feeling guilty of having certain feelings, feeling hard to express my feelings and then regretting being honest, repressing vulnerability then being traumatized when triggered, feeling having responsibility for people who surrounds me but still feeling angry that nobody seems to look after me the same way. I properly annoy myself with all this anxiety and blaming myself for not being capable to let it all go. This shit sucks sometimes.
5	The only people I find myself disliking is people don‚Äôt seem genuine. Like I can see through their facade, and I can tell that what they say isn‚Äôt who they are or what they actually want to say, it‚Äôs what they know people want to hear. 
4	I have two people that I see on daily basis that irritate me just by being themselves. And I feel like crap about it every day.\n\nThe other one is always ready to throw people under the bus to make himself look better or smarter. He's also capable of only very shallow conversation, which makes him boring to talk with. He also has many annoying mannerisms. \n\nThe other one is very clingy. I find him creeping next to me all the time and it really irritates me. He's always ready to give shitty advice in a way that triggers my reactance big time - I can't stand people telling me how to live my life. He's also not great at getting social cues. \n\nAnd now I feel like I'm an absolutely despicable person again. At times I really hate myself for being able to be a nice person to these people. 
2	Yes
2	There is the dude that I work with, newer coworker. \n\nHe sits on the other side of this moveable wall, and just comes over whenever any one on my side of the wall starts talking and just stands there waiting to chime in. \n\n\nOr he will sit 3 feet behind me and either doesn‚Äôt care or is super unaware that he is taking up space. \n\nAnd I know he is there waiting with out even having to look at him I can just feel his energy. 
2	Yep I can't stand self absorbed drama queens. I can pretty much get on with anyone else!
2	I run a knitting group. There‚Äôs a real mix of people who‚Äôve come over the years and I have got on with all of them, bar one. She was very judgmental and never missed an opportunity to make other people feel bad.  Someone had crocheted this amazing rainbow granny stripe blanket and we were all admiring it. She touched it and said, ‚ÄúI prefer natural fibres.‚Äù Another time she smugly told someone who was in tears about breastfeeding that ‚ÄúI breastfed all my children for two years.‚Äù I spent all my time trying to resist the urge to slap her and was very relieved when she stopped coming. 
2	We are able to be social chameleons of sorts and get along with anyone if we want to. It doesn't mean we like everyone. Fuck, there are a lot of annoying bastards out there. \n\nI treat every stranger as an equal though. Each person has a lot of potential and I like to get to know anyone I interact with. Some expose pretty quickly that they aren't "woke" or that they are super self-absorbed and like have no idea on how to hold a conversation. These people annoy me, things like compassion and mutual understanding are pretty important to how I communicate. Its just harder to talk to assholes. 
2	I am struggling right now with my new boss who is extremely political. Sometimes it seems like he can behave like a human being and have empathy and tell the truth. But at other times he will exhibit behaviors I hate most.. asking how I am doing and visibly tuning out about 2 seconds in, being vague and confusing in answering questions when the answer should be simple, and putting more effort into powerpoints than how the actual work that is being promised will get done. 
1	Yes. And it's not even that I don't like the person, it's sometimes as simple as personality clash. One of my friends tends to come across to me as very braggy, kind of overbearing. I cannot take it for too long, I get extremely annoyed. But I love her! All she truly thinks and feels is amazing, I just can't stand her conversation at times, haha. 
1	I was *really* annoyed with my SO for essentially singing a song wrong. I didn't say anything and just kept getting annoyed until finally, I just said: I feel really bad about this but you are annoying me right now with your singing. He said: You don't have to be sorry about being annoyed. And to be honest, that alleviated any annoying feelings I had. A space where I was totally safe to feel however I wanted - very opposite of annoying haha
2	As an ENFP, do you prefer being asked questions or asking questions?	and what kind of questions do you like being asked?
8	I like to ask questions. I take too long to answer any questions ü§£
5	I find that my closest bonds are only with those who like asking me questions too and enjoy listening too
4	Both are my favorite. I want both to be happening. Simultaneously would be amazing if possible. Give me ALL the information and personal insight. 
5	I like answering questions. It feel good when someone is interested in my life and I love telling stories and explains things. I like making people feel like they know me 
3	I like asking questions, but I also love talking about myself or on topics I know a lot about, so  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø 
1	I like hearing answers, but I don't like to come up with all the questions myself.\n\nI love questions that are posed to both/all the people and then both/all the people share their answers.
8	How do you guys release emotions?	I‚Äôve always relied on journaling to let my emotions out, but it has become a source of rumination now. I also talk with my friends and family, but they‚Äôre not available all the time and I want to learn some thing I can do on my own. So how do you guys release your emotions? (I‚Äôm going through a breakup btw if that helps)
4	In productive ways- the gym! If I‚Äôm excited, music, dancing, singing, driving in car. I listen to music/ shows that are reflective of my mood. Just a lot of thinking about how I‚Äôm feeling. Sometimes ignore or feel apathetic 
4	Ya know- there are a lot of ways for me. But I'm going to focus on the idea of journaling... I'm often too impatient to write. Plus, I do a good bit of processing while I'm doing other things (daily dog walks, house chores, biking, etc). So, I started recording voice memos on my phone.  \nSometimes they are to a specific person that I want to send a message to but can't (may be relevant for you too if you're going though a breakup?), or sometimes it's just stream of consciousness out loud.   \nEither way, the audio journaling has become really accessible and helpful. And it's fun to listen back to old ones, kinda like flipping back through a notebook. I can hear my brain work sometimes- hearing the pauses, the breath, the little moments of clarity. It's helpful.   \nSo I record these while I'm doing something, often during my morning walk in the woods. I can hear the ambient noise in the recording, which adds to the moment in time aspect of it. For us ENFPs, I would guess that this may work well.  \nGood luck finding what works!
3	I listen to music. I've got a spotify list for each mood. It really is my therapy!
3	I love to express my emotion through playing some music instruments
2	Cry, write down your thoughts, listen to music, paint, do a really sweaty workout!
2	I occasionally write poetry or fiction regarding my mood. This often leads to my best works.\n\nAlso word of warning, careful how you dissipate your emotions, used to play video games when upset, and it became a little out of hand with the escapism. Avoid techniques that you would consider a poor use of time when in a better mental state
2	I usually start a new project that I feel will improve me in some way.\n\nExercise/find a better job/dedicate more time to my current projects/ that kind of thing. I guess it seems like distraction, but it helps you get some distance from the problem and allows you to process it in a different way.\n\nEdit to 100% add music as others said, without music I tend to spiral and almost literally get stuck in my chair. 
2	Meditation, sports, exercise in general
2	Phone a close friend or sister and rant, meditating, journal, exercise.
2	Working out,  writing, tripping, meditation, long walks.
1	I rant long paragraphs to my friends over facebook messaging :D Its relaxing. Then I go read/watch some heartwarming stories. 
1	I do yoga, basically this is what makes me forget my anxiety and make me calm and balanced. It's also a good workout and elevates your self-esteem :)
155	ENFP Relationship issues. No one can keep up.	I‚Äôm not super into personality types, but I found this sub and I feel like I can relate to some of y‚Äôall, and maybe someone can relate to me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI keep attracting the wrong type of people. I love everyone. I like to help people. I like to get to know people. I express my thoughts and feelings constantly. But it is being misconstrued as something else. I‚Äôve had multiple guys pursue me recently as if I‚Äôm, ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù  A common comment is, ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt been able to talk to anyone like this before.‚Äù That shit scares me away. This is just me. This isn‚Äôt special to me. I talk to everyone like this. I‚Äôm sorry that you haven‚Äôt been able to talk to someone who lets you express your feelings? That sounds depressing as hell. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo while dating, these guys think I'm special and so perfect for them, but that's it. It's like no one puts any effort in. I‚Äôm the ideas, the planner, the executer, and the excitement. I ask the questions, I keep the conversations going. I water them and they grow, but no one waters me. I don't want to attract these types of people anymore. I want for once to have someone keep up with me. I want for someone to surprise me. Bring something new to the table. I am not content with minimal effort. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone else feel like this?
63	>I water them and they grow, but no one waters me. \n\nWow, I felt that in my soul. You are so on point with this post, I feel like it is such an ENFP thing. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times a guy has told me that he loves me or said that he thinks I‚Äôm his soulmate... on the first date. The second I see that look on their face I know I‚Äôm done. \n\nI wish I had advice for you but I don‚Äôt. I say nurture you friendships with the ones that can keep up with you. Surround yourself with similar personality types and maybe you‚Äôll cross paths with someone that shares this trait with you. I have yet to find such luck. \n\nBut also I think it is important to keep your eye out for people that water you without you noticing. My boyfriend is not very wordy or overly affectionate however I am e x p l o s i v e with my feelings towards him. We clash sometimes but melt together even more. I reached a point a few months into our relationship where I felt like I was helping him grow and he wasn‚Äôt helping me. I made it a point to mention this to him and he agreed, and took action. Definitely not in the same way that you and I express it (we are very aware of the world and LOVE to analyze it), but he does it in his own way. Whether it‚Äôs reminding me to put ointment on my eczema or encouraging me to apply to a research program that would send me to Africa for two months, he‚Äôs helping me grow. It‚Äôs just not always easy to recognize because it‚Äôs not in a way that‚Äôs familiar to me. \n\nAaand now I‚Äôm rambling. Just though it would be something to keep an eye out for. \n\nEdit: Formatting. Fucking mobile. 
47	YES! And when our darker side comes out (we're not sunshine and rainbows and unicorns 24/7) they can't support us the same way we have for them. I've had this problem with a few friendships as well.\n\nI've been single for a very long time and plan on remaining so until I can find someone who's really right for me. So far it's looking like I'll probably die alone, but I like my own company so I'm kind of cool with that.
38	I‚Äôve said this with almost the exact same words to my friends. I‚Äôm content with being single for the next decade now and let people enter the slipstream of their own accord. But I‚Äôm not slowing down or turning down the intensity for anyone.
28	I can really relate to this experience, both in friendships and in dating. I've learned to step back, observe and evaluate people a lot more carefully early on, to see if the connection and support is mutual. You want to avoid falling into what I call the "therapist trap", which is where the relationship becomes all about them confiding in you and receiving one-sided emotional support. For instance, on a first date or meet up with a friend, consider things like: \n\n* Do they ask you questions about yourself?\n* Do they listen well (e.g. can they practice active listening skills)?\n* Are they able to give and receive emotional support equally?\n* Can they withhold unsolicited advice when you talk about something you struggle with?\n* Does the conversation feel balanced, or are you mostly just listening?\n* Do they message you first, or do you always have to message them first?\n* Do they suggest or plan outings, or do you always have to do it?\n\nI generally have a rule of three when it comes to reaching out or taking initiative with people. I'm happy to message first three times, but if they don't message first after that, it's usually best to move on. Same with asking questions - I think it's okay to ask three questions in a row, but if they don't ask any back after that or make an attempt to engage with me, then they probably just like talking about themselves. 
20	Me! You have put in words exactly what happens to me almost all the time. In my case, when it's over, they want to stay friends because I've helped them so much. Then, they meet "the one" who thinks they're "da shit"! Can a girl meet one those guys who is already fixed by someone else? Someone who can keep up would be such a breath of fresh air!
18	I have felt like that before - until I found my current partner of (holy crap) 13 years. We complement each other, and I don't feel like I need to be everything. I think it works so well because we are SO different. I am ENFP - she is INTJ. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't give up hope. Most of all, don't think that there is something wrong with you.  
15	I honestly relate to this so hard. my current boyfriend (an ESTP, which I guess isn‚Äôt that common of a pair actually!) is honestly the greatest, and we both push each other to be better and listen and care for each other when we‚Äôre down. \n\nhowever, before I met him, I was locked into a cycle of dating/being with guys who were never really ‚Äúthere‚Äù for me like I always was for them. I‚Äôd be rewarded for emotional labor with statements like, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre amazing to talk to,‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so empathetic,‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the only one who gets me,‚Äù etc etc etc. I worked hard to get them through their problems and grow, yet every time I needed some support it seemed like such an ORDEAL for them, like UGH you‚Äôre supposed to be the girl who‚Äôs always kind and considerate and positive why do you suddenly have a problem? They were never outright mean about it, but in the end they all proved to be one sided relationships that I justified staying in for way too long because they were interesting, fun, and they ‚Äúneeded me‚Äù, even sometimes just because I felt lonely. \n\nwhen my boyfriend and I met and immediately clicked, I was honestly shocked at how different it was from every single one of my other relationships. I didn‚Äôt even realize the extent of how bad this string of guys had affected my perception of what a relationship was, and even what I deserved as a person. I had even imagined going through the rest of my life casually dating and ultimately remaining single because I could never imagine anyone putting in the ‚Äúeffort‚Äù it took to marry me. \n\nI don‚Äôt want to leave you with any cliche advice, so I‚Äôll just say that your awareness of this is awesome and can allow you to just move on a lot faster than I did, and that there are people out there that will give back the love you give them and be genuinely grateful for the love they receive. don‚Äôt ever let yourself become too cynical! those guys didn‚Äôt deserve you and if you remain open to it, you‚Äôll be able to find someone who does.
11	This is me this is me this is meeeeee this is US!!! I‚Äôm sick of going on dates with guys (I‚Äôve been single for 4ish months) and having them tell me I‚Äôm so easy to talk to and I‚Äôm a breath of fresh air and all this stuff. Great. My ex used to always say that shit too and say I was the one and how great I was when we were good (I recently started NC TODAY BECAUSE OF IT) ugh. I love and hate myself. But people need to relax with the mentality that they can take and not give. I need ears to listen to me, too!!
9	People who can keep up are 100% out there. You'll know fairly early days too. \n\nFirst date with my INFJ boyfriend the connection was there immediately (I posted about the date to the INFJ sub because I was so excited). The conversation flows. He makes me laugh. He is intelligent. And he puts just as much effort into the relationship as I do - keeping in daily contact, arranging dates as often as I do, bringing me flowers for no reason or doing thoughtful cute gestures. \nHe definitely doesn't put me on a pedestal (why would he? I'm not perfect!) but he makes it clear he is keen in a healthy way.
7	Absolutely. The only way forward to stay cautious, don't let people choose you. When you meet someone who can keep up and surprise you (that's how I think of it too), you will feel it. Then you can choose them. It does not happen often, but if you keep your eyes open and refuse to settle, it will come. ENFPs tend to get a lot of validation anyway, so when people want you to be their manic pixie dream girl/boy, take a moment to appreciate how it feels but don't fall for it.
7	Jeeeeezzz, this hits home..! A few year ago I completely gave up on finding someone who could keep up. I worked on myself, did what I liked and tried tot trust my gut when I dated someone if I immidiately felt "he likes you too much/this isnt equal/you'll never REALLY like him". It was hard because breaking hearts sucks and feels rather arrogant sometimes if done soon and I've been accused of having too high standards/not giving things a real chance. But HELL YEAH am I happy I did it! I've learned so much about myself and what I want and how great my friends and family are... And found my current ENFJ SO and damn, does he keep up and even challenge me further than anyone ever before. Good luck   <3
6	Reminds me of my ENFP girlfriend when we first started dating lol
5	I‚Äôm kinda creeped out at how accurate every comment is and how accurate this post is?????? relatable 
6	Fucking HELL this is relatable 
6	Exactly everything you mentioned. We live in a world where people do not ask enough questions about each other, which is often why people will say that they have 'never been able to talk to anyone this way'. Because you show interest (maybe not necessarily care). \n\nOn the flip side I've had some amazing boyfriends who 'watered' me. Attentive, intelligent, curious, and exciting. But there were some deeper issues going on with myself. So instead of being disappointed in people make sure that you'll be ready for the people who will amaze you. Of course, not to project my own experience on you, but just based on the way you describe how you feel in the last paragraph. 
6	YES YES YES.\n\nAlso I'm super strong willed and I usually attract men who just want to let me lead/make all the decisions and I need someone who is at least as strong willed as I am so they can tell me no when I need to hear it.
4	Lol are you me??? felt like I wrote that. This is why i‚Äôm pretty sure i won‚Äôt get into a relationship anytime soon though some claim i‚Äôm ‚Äúperfect for them‚Äù. but are they perfect FOR ME?
5	Opposite problems here, but echoing ENFP relationship issues. I hate the /r/NiceGuys mentality but I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm ‚Äúhusband material‚Äù as an excuse for not being interested in a relationship. It‚Äôs really frustrating. My girlfriend of almost a year at one point broke up with me because she saw our relationship lasting a really long time and she didn‚Äôt want to miss out on college experiences because of it. That was heartbreaking. 
5	I'm probably the only person that kind of disagrees here...? I honestly would love for people to tell me that I ignited something in them that no one else has before. It makes me feel special, makes me feel I did something for that person.\n\nIf I feel the other person isn't putting as much effort to make me happy, I'll probably tell them (in a subtle way). Communication is key because most of the time, I doubt the other person is conscious of what effects their actions are having on me. If they are aware of it and still continue not reciprocating the dedication I put in then that's where I'd reconsider. \n\nI guess it works better in friendships because you can have many friends, but in a relationship, you're sort of relying on that one person to satisfy and fulfill you, and many a times one person isn't enough for us, which leads to the falling apart of the relationship. 
4	I feel this. The way I explained it to my boyfriend (INTJ) when we were having problems because men kept trying to talk to me is they project what they want in a woman onto  me. I‚Äôm just a friendly blank canvas for them to mold into whatever type of girl they like best.\n\nIf they meet me at the gym and I make a friendly conversation I‚Äôm their perfect friendly fitness  girl who is going to change their life by motivating them to workout, if I meet them at a concert I‚Äôm a fun loving free-spirited concert girl whose only going to bring fun into their lives, etc\nbut the point is that none of these men see me for who I am. I‚Äôve tried going on dates with them before but it‚Äôs all them monologue, me asking a couple questions, and then them thinking we‚Äôre soul mates, when they have no idea who I am!\n\nI feel like ENFP women get manic pixie dream girl-Ed a lot and as frustrating as it is, just know it‚Äôs not your fault. You‚Äôre a kind person and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with being friendly! Be firm with your boundaries (‚ÄúIt was really nice to meet you but I see us more as friends‚Äù ‚Äúoh sorry I don‚Äôt give out my phone number to strangers‚Äù ‚Äúactually I‚Äôm not interested in dating right now‚Äù etc) and remember to do as much self care as you need.\n\nI promise you there are people out there who won‚Äôt project what they want onto you, or as you said, will water your garden as much as you water theirs. It took me years to find mine, but it‚Äôs well worth the wait. Good luck and keep those boundaries strong!
3	I completely understand how you feel. I became single last fall, & now at least 3 of my guy friends have confessed their love to me. I really like them all, but I don't feel the same way about them. To me, they are just friends. \n\nBut the man who left me, he was the one. He made me feel whole, like I could share all of myself with him. He was my sunshine, & now my life is so grey. 
3	Damn this's soooo relatable with my experience.\nIt's give, give, give without actually expecting anyone to give back, but hoping that I'd(past tense) found someone who wanted to give back, only to find myself really disappointed.\n\nBut I've found that I was losing myself in the romance side of my life that once I focused elsewhere I gave and wasn't hoping to recieve back, it was just a natural part of me to give happily, as long as I was not giving too much of myself in a sacrificial way.\n\nAnd I just get on with my day. Giving then turns into an experience that raises my energy levels when you see someone suddenly smile and feel truly appreciated and you just happily carry on with your day untied to their response. It's lovely.\n\nAnd I believe that someone will show up whom naturally WANTS to take care of you and give back equally, but I recommend you stop looking and just focus on enjoying life üòÅüòÅüòÅ I promise it will get better when you do.\nAs well, go start meditating if you haven't already üòä
3	Thank you for posting this.\nI feel like I‚Äôve been therapist, sex therapist, marriage counsellor, best friend, trusted friend, confidant, ‚Äòdear Abbey advice column‚Äô... to men, women, teens, anyone.\nI‚Äôm in a healthy, loving, intelligent marriage to a secure, self-assured man (INTP)... but... those ‚Äòfriends‚Äô who ask so much and give so little... sometimes all I can do is drive while I play my favourite music, and the tears fill my eyes.
2	This is so me
2	You need ENFP !! Im So Happy with mine. He surprises me and I‚Äôm growing as much as he grows .  It‚Äôs amazing to be in ENFP/ENFP relationship 
2	How is it that I feel the same? The reasons (alot) for me being single other than having a PTSD from bring cheat in an 8 year old relationship is this. I am sick of bring the one who put all the effort and trying. I for once wanted to feel like the special one, the prince or idk.. make me feel special and loved. I enjoy giving out my love but I wanted to feel what it feels like being loved. Anyone...who sees a lot of value in me. 
2	I am shaken to the core by this post. Did I black out, make an alt account and post this? Am I you from another dimension? 
1	Still kinda feel the same way even if I'm in a healthy relationship. It just seems like we're the ones doing the heavy work all the time. This is so me. 
1	It‚Äôs not as sad as it seems! I guess it just took me 45 years (my age) to see some of the patterns that were repeating, year in, year out. As I said, my husband is my anchor. As for dating, or any new friendship: I agree that we are awesome at giving people an open, accepting space where they can be themselves. I just wish it wasn‚Äôt so rare!

11	Emotional storage	Do you guys ever feel like you give and give and give, and after so much giving you can‚Äôt seem to give to yourself? Then you get stuck in this loop of continuous giving until you just break down, then everyone just stops and wonders what happened. You gave so much of your heart away, that you couldn‚Äôt save any for yourself. Then you‚Äôre left feeling hollow, drained. Then, when you try to find a moment to yourself, you feel so bad about taking time to fill up your emotional ‚Äúgas tank‚Äù that you might only fill it a quarter of the way up. Never really giving yourself the time needed to rest. Then you start failing people because you just don‚Äôt have enough to give anymore.Then you are left to just blame yourself for not living up to people‚Äôs standards. It‚Äôs like this horrible loop. How do you guys deal with this?
5	I've learned to avoid sharing energy with people who can't or won't give me energy back.
4	Wait until your Te function kicks in as you age... then you‚Äôll learn how to create boundaries. What you need in your life is boundaries to protect your energy levels and mental health! 
3	No im a pretty selfish ENFP. I hate saying no to people, so I avoid offering help (unless it's really important). \nI also take time for myself, so I rarely get stressed. My kids have a happy Mum and i'm a happy wife because I take care of my own and my familys needs before anything else.\nSo, my advice is be more selfish, at least for a while.
2	All types have something similar to this, but it is different **to how it feels** and **what causes it** depending on your function order and thus your MBTI type.\n\nSo when an ENFP is feeling this way you need two things, simultaneously.\n\n* Si stuff **to recharge** your body and to get stuff down in the short term.\n\n* Ni stuff **not to recharge you** but you have a goal to organize around in the future.  Ni provides the goal to an ENFP, Ni is an ENFP's control.  \n\n * ENFPs use Ni all the time but it is hard for an ENFP to describe this hidden Ni goal for Ni is a shadow / subdued trait that still lingers in the back of your mind but you can't really describe it.\n\nOne helps anchor you to the present, like a string on a kite, while the other is like the wind on your back to help direct you in the future.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere is another thing an ENFP needs when this happens.  \n\n* It is the medium stuff which is Te and this helps mobilizes you for the right bite site Te, ***that is practical to the matter at hand*** is a form of activatiion energy which the ENFP can do to get from here to there^(I want to summon that image from the Doctor Strange movie in your head).  ***The right form of Te allows an ENFP to take a leap of faith.***  \n\nThe problem but also the sublime beauty for an ENFP is that it has to be the right Te, is it has to be a form of bite site Te that is useful for the ENFP and someone elses Te which is not useful to an ENFP can not be shoved in to an ENFP for it will not be compatible.  The right form of Te is is applicable to the matter and hand, it also has to line up with the ENFP's goals, their values, their drives, and so on.  Put another way the Te has to be compatible with the ENFP's Fi but also the other 3 introvert energies.  The wrong form of Te is like shoving a square peg in a round hole, it does not work.  Thus the beautiful sublime energy of this is you have to give an ENFP many ideas and do not be judging them when you give them the many ideas, instead just listen and let them feel understood, and suddenly when an ENFP sees the right Te in the word blather you give them, they will pick it up and use it.  **They will use the right Te to make a leap of faith.**
2	For me personally I have learned to enjoy solitude. Pls don't get this confused with isolation either. But I purposely try to get in some solitude time reading a book, meditating, or something else you can do alone and disconnected from people at least every couple of days for at least an hour or two. It was very hard at first dealing with the feeling of being left out or having so many commitments due to always saying yes to people.  \n\n\nSaying no is not something to be scared of or feel bad about. There is the concept of having and setting healthy boundaries where you don't let people abuse your time and energy. I actively plan my days to at least have some alone time for solitude and it has helped tremendously.
4	Smothering partner	I'm currently feeling a bit smothered by my INTP (though I have my doubts about the T part) girlfriend. She's got something kind and caring and lovely prepared for me tonight and I just.. honestly.. I'm not feeling it today.\n\nAny ideas on how to change my attitude?
2	Hey, if this is about the same person who cheated on you in your post history (sorry I creeped), I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre in a healthy relationship. Honestly, this sounds really manipulative. \n\nDon‚Äôt bend your emotions to the will of others; this seems to be something a lot of ENFPs struggle with, it‚Äôs something I struggle with, but it‚Äôs not healthy behaviour. \n\nI‚Äôm genuinely concerned about your situation. I hope you‚Äôre okay OP.
1	Sometimes, men are like rubberbands. They stretch until they snap. And when they do, they need some alone time, until they're ready to get back and be just as smothering to their partner >:D\n\nKidding aside, just let them know. It's okay to not be feeling it.
14	ENFP male in our society and the problems that come with it	So I came to the conclusion that I am indeed an ENFP but there are certain things that I want to get out of my system. \n\nI feel like this is not talked about a lot. First of all, being an ENFP means that you have Fi as your auxiliary function. While that in itself is good and dandy, it means that you are somewhat emotional, of course that wouldn't be a problem if I was woman because it is more socially accepted to be emotional as a woman but as a man... not so much. You see, men in our society (at least where I come from) are expected to be more masculine, assertive, down-to-earth, reserved... Men can't express their emotions as much as women do and that is really suffocating. I always have to be reserved, hold back on my emotions if I want to be accepted and not labeled "gay", "flamboyant"... And you would think that if you know these rules you could adapt, right? Wrong. It is easier to do in a short run than it is a long term strategy. I get exhausted in conversations fairly quickly, and have to recharge alone while processing my emotions. This is why I love weed so much, if you're high and you're behaving out of ordinary, you can just blame it on being high, but if you do it sober, people start assuming, and I can't change people but only myself. I feel like I always have to put on a mask, I can't get out of my shell. Is there anything I can do or do I have to just go with it because this is how people and society are?
12	You only have one life, just be you. Fuck society's expectations. Be an example of a different way to live. Hang out with people that value emotional intelligence. Hang out with new people and make new friends. Forcing yourself to act in contradiction to how you feel is just going to hurt you in the long run. 
11	ENFP dude here *fistbump*\n\nNo easy answer my friend. First make sure you aren‚Äôt mixing up being emotional with being a pushover or weak (or tone deaf). We all have to match the frequencies around us. You need to work it from both ends, both in finding the signal of your tribe and dialing into your different modes of expression. \n\nOr try channelling that emotion through art. \n\nTrust me you‚Äôll find that being an emotional male is WAY more of an asset, if not a superpower as time goes on. Apathy and emotional unavailability is played out, sincerity is the new cool. 
9	Infj F here. It‚Äôs maybe because MBTI wise we are such a good match, but I really love emotional men. Not to be confused with whiny. I noticed too that it‚Äôs hard for you in todays society, but I‚Äôve got the feeling that it is changing, slowly. But maybe you are just socialising in the wrong circles. If you put on a mask you won‚Äôt find people who accept you the way you are. Being oneself is hard, but it might pay off. Be emotional. Be flamboyant. Be yourself. And find people who like you like that. 
5	Yeah the whole Alpha/Beta Male thing is utter bs for most men especially feeling ones like us. Gender roles are stupid and i hope one day they'll be less strict. I'm on your side on this.
6	ENFP male here too.\n\nI would encourage you, just like others here to just be open to all the things your ENFP self can bring to the table. I'm not familiar with your culture in particular, but one of my most amusing stories is that my best friend and I had our entire group of friends at university absolutely convinced that we were gay together. Mostly because I'm leaning towards the emotional side, especially when I get on one of my "Captain Wild-Child" kicks that we ENFPs are famous for. \nBlunting and suppressing your emotions is a surefire way to kill that unbridled passion for life that we can bring to the table that can be so utterly intoxicating and inspiring for other personality types, and who would want to take that away from other people around you (at the risk of sounding overly egotistical lol)?\n\nStay sincere. Stay honesty. Especially to yourself and how you live life to the absolute fullest because of all the positive, inspirational energy you can bring to the world. Leave the world a better place than it was when you found it, right?? üòä
6	Honestly, the people that are putting you down for having feelings are toxic and go such eggs.\n\nFeel, be unafraid and unabashed. Feel and be honest. Feel and know what you're feeling and you'll attract other people who are like that. Fuck being afraid to feel. Fuck conformity. Fuck all that noise.
4	Just be yourself and find people who respect that. There's nothing wrong with having emotions as a man and people who say otherwise are not worth listening to.
5	As a straight ENFP male who has always been called gay by people, I 100% relate. I wear sweaters and paint my nails and talk about feelings/emotions with people all the time. I just want to be myself and live my life how I want to. Don't get too held up on the "haters". Live how you want to and good things will come.
2	Hang out with people that go to festivals.
2	Hey, where are you hailing from? I'm genuinely curious.
2	Been struggling with the same things. INFP male here. With Fi as my main function I've always felt out of place. Recently I've found there are actually some people who value feeling in males. Then again, I feel like they are really faking it and tell me only so I don't feel bad. Guess I can't be pleased. \nSurely will check back, hoping to find (even part of) an answer to this. 
3	I might have been doing something for years, I'm still a noob	I'm one of those jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none people. I've got into like a thousand things, learning both skills and activities. I haven't persevered in most of them, but there are a few that I've been into for years. But still, I have little to no knowledge and/or skills in that fields. For example, I've been a tolkienist for almost seven years now. My friend has been one for similar time and guess what. She knows much more than me and I feel like being looked down on by her. My other friend has a great knowledge in fields of make-up, informatics, pharmacy, psychiatry and also Tolkien (but okay, she's been into that a bit longer). Even my 11yo cousin knows how to use my own phone better than me. In general, most of my friends have such subject(s) thst they have been passionate about for years and they know so much about said subject. Yesterday I came across somebody I could actually share that little knowledge I have with and who actually learned something from me. And oh boy, it felt so great. It felt like being smart, having something to share, being appreciated and worth anything. For most of time I feel like a stupid, worthless noob that everybody looks down on. \n\nIs it a common ENFP struggle, or is that just me?
4	Yeah this is a common ENFP thing here. \n\nIts worth noting the full quote though\n\n>Jack of all trades, master of none,\n>though oftentimes better than master of one.\n\nIts not bad to be a jack of all trades. People who are "masters" of certain subjects understand that they know more about x topic than 99% of the population, and (the ones that are good people) aren't going to look down on anyone for expressing what knowledge or thoughts they have about a subject. My guess is that your feelings of being a noob on these subjects is more just your insecurity (Fi) than other people's actual feelings towards you. So I hope that helps. \n\nHang out with new people who aren't into tolkien, and you'll be the tolkien expert and provide them with a lot of knowledge on tolkien. Like, I thought I knew about Tolkien and then I met a guy who knew WAY more about the subjects than I did. however, here is the best part. Occasionally he'll learn things from me about tolkien or LOTR that he didn't know, or had forgotten. And beyond Tolkien he learns a lot from me about all the other interests that I have. There are always lessons and things to learn from others. Nobody is worthless. 
14	Today I want to die hoping I will still be alive tomorrow.	Nothing serious. It's just one of those nights. Maybe you guys can relate.
9	As someone who went through the stage of suicidal, please remember that thoughts are just thoughts, emotions too, just see them, feel them and let them sit there. Whether or not you choose to believe in your thoughts or emotions is under your control. \n\n
7	 The Defeated Optimist? \nAll the best!\nHappy valentines! 
3	Hang in there! Today will pass to make place for tomorrow. \nI know the feeling. Anyone knows how to speed up time?
23	Met an older enfp(not confirmed) in real life for the first time and it was amazing.	He is a writing tutor at my university and Im a doctoral student. I was having pretty hard time at this school for more than an year now. \n\nI was not expecting anything except to get advice on my writing, when this middle aged gentleman walked in. After giving me really good advice on my paper for a while, he suddenly asked me about all my troubles, like he knew me from before. \n\nI was tired of talking about it because people never seem to relate, and with him, I didnt even have to try! I just said a few words and it was as if he had been watching me from above. \n\nThen he started going on and on about his difficult experiences when he was getting his doctoral degree(literature major, his thesis was about ‚Äúlove‚Äù in literature), and it was so similar to mine. He told me vulnerable stories when he cried while writing thesis, and how he got through that moment. \n\nI asked him questions and he turned to advice mode and it was so helpful...It wasnt patronizing or intrusive at all, just someone who had to share after he gained perspective through his own hardship. \n\nIt really felt like an angel sent him my way, because it all happened so suddenly, and I didnt even ask for it. \n\nAll the while he is serious and joking at the same time, showing vulnerable feelings and action oriented at the same time.\nI realized, he is a grown up ENFP. \n(Altho im grown up too)\n\nJust wanted to share this experience with y‚Äôall. \nI realizd I do this for other people too, and I never had it the opposite way. Sometimes people listening to your problem is just not enough. You need someone to reach out, and ENFPs have this power to reach out and not be intrusive, which can be hard to imagine for other types. \n\nPeople have loved me for doing what he did, making them feel good, but I never understood it myself, I was just being me. \nI was becoming self conscious because no one else does that. I thought i should try to shut up and only listen. \n\nI think ENFPs are magical in that way. He probably doesnt even realize what an impact he had on me, either. \nThose of you out there, keep being you! You are wonderful human beings to strangers. \n
9	Oh captain my captain 
5	thanks for sharing, that was really touching
6	Beautiful. \n\n&#x200B;
4	I love this. Thankful for beautiful souls
4	I feel MOVED
4	This is wonderful to hear, sort of like any other-worldly, truly relational experience- in my interpretation. I absolutely adore that feeling in which you feel someone relates to you or is very similar and there is comfort in that. If someone shared my enthusiasm, or just ‚Äògets me‚Äô it is an automatic mood booster. Best of luck with the doctorate, you are awesome :)
6	When other people don't match your enthusiasm	Heya! So this is just a bit of an ongoing issue in my life:\n\nI tend to get over excited about thoughts, ideas and theories, and am pretty much incapable of keeping them to myself. With my ENFP head, I feel (and instinctively assume that everyone else feels) like they'd love to chat and make friends and spill all their secrets and talk about their dreams within the first day of meeting me. Even with long-time friends and family members - I love getting excited WITH them.\n\nSo, since I willingly and consistently lay out all of myself at other people's feet, in a way that makes me pretty vulnerable, it always feels like a bit of a blow to the chest when they don't show any interest in returning my enthusiasm, or even act a bit weirded out. This also happens on smaller, everyday scales, like when I send my friends/fam a text filled with exclamation points and caps and questions, and they reply with curt answers with no punctuation - it still delivers a tiny pang of hurt.\n\nOf course, I'm not blaming anyone for this; as I grew up I realized that this tendency of mine to enthusiastically open myself up to anyone and everyone isn't exactly *normal*, and I've worked at toning it down a bit. But it still gets me into these situations every now and then. I find it hard to get it through my head that other people's minds work differently than mine, that the enthusiasm I sometimes expect from them just doesn't come naturally to them, and their lack of a response isn't necessarily meant as a slight towards me.\n\nI guess with this post I'm just looking for some validation that I'm not crazy or alone in these experiences, since being 'shot down' like this (even though I know it's all in my head) makes me feel like a bit of a freak sometimes.\n\n&#x200B;
2	I relate 100% to what you wrote, you are not alone. It's really bad because when it happens I usually tend to lose all my enthusiasm and then I'm like sad? Anyway you are not alone, I know how you feel.
1	You‚Äôre not crazy or a freak, keep improving yourself but don‚Äôt stop being yourself, and you‚Äôll find the right people. 
1	I can relate and it's great to be yourself. Do not tone it down. It can be annoying at times to continuously meet less enthusiastic people but, you are you and normal is overrated. You aren't crazy neither. \nThere a lot more people like yourself out there: you are not alone!
1	This is super relatable! I have a few friends that I know well enough to joke about this though. I can be like, "No! You need to be more excited than that!" and they'll fake it. Haha. 
1	"....Love getting excited WITH them."\n\nOh yeah. Most definitely. This happens....a LOT. It's one of my favorite things, to hear people talk passionately and enthusiastically about what they love. A lot of times they act surprised when I respond with enthusiasm and interest.\n\nSo no. You aren't crazy. Keep it up. That energy can be SO inspirational in SO many ways.
1	I know exactly what you mean. My INTJ husband will respond like this all of the time and usually that's okay, but every now and then it gets to me in just this way. 
115	The other side of the manic-pixie stereotype...	Taking a cue from the other post, here's some non-fuzzy-unicorn things about me you all might relate to (or not at all). I'm a little bit older, so keep that in mind; all of this was a result of deliberate hard work. So just for fun...\n\n* I'm extremely passionate about lifestyle optimization. It's an obsession that is neverending. I've worked on implementing minimalism in all aspects of my life over the past couple of years. For example, my wardrobe is now mostly interchangeable, high-quality neutrals. I constantly evolve systems for productivity and knowledge/task management. As I mentioned in another thread, I'm almost never late to an appointment (although this took a lot of practice). I relate to the notion for Fi/Te (messy inner/clean outer) and Ti/Fe (clean inner/messy outer).\n* I work really hard at concise and effective communication. I often find myself summarizing for other people to move conversations along (since I see almost every point of view). I can definitely bulldoze through a shit ton of tangents, but I'm very careful to make sure you're with me along the way. I can tell the instant I lose someone to missing comprehension or boredom. And any kind of rambling comes when I'm developing an idea out loud (Ne). My personal stories are usually to the point and don't come with a lot of extraneous Si-style details (have you heard an ESFJ tell a story?).\n* Compared to Fe-types, I'm not that good at counseling. I empathize deeply, but to the degree that I have my own experience to draw on. I struggle not to project my own lens on other people sometimes, since Te is very focused on problem solving. Since I respect everyone's personal journey, I find myself mostly quiet. I've learned just to validate their feelings and ask questions, rather than project any of my own philosophy. \n* Yeah, I often have too many ideas and too many interests. Probably one of the most successful procrastinators you'll ever meet. Didn't do that great in school. But when I'm truly passionate about something I dig. the. fuck. in. When conditions are right I lock up like a pitbull. Enter into flow state where time goes away and it's just pure emotional drive. Used to put into 12-14 hours a day for my career like it was nothing. \n* I'm definitely, extremely emotional. It can be overwhelming at times. But it's just more data, and it gets processed internally, cleaned up, then expressed externally. In a perfect world, of course. When I don't need to be professional or my guard is down it can just bubble out though. \n* I never struggled with being "ditzy." Energetic, enthusiastic, idealistic, a little goofy, and sometimes forgetful, but not ditzy or dumb. I'm always hyper-aware of how I come across (often to a fault). I usually always had some big philosophical musing on my mind that I share with like-minded folks. Always questioning the status quo and how to make things better. \n* People who party with me for the first time are often surprised just how much I can let go and have fun.\n\nOkay that's all for now. Not trying to flex, but just wanted to put it out there. I agree some ENFPs here are sinking too far into being hot steaming messes. Just wanted to give some lip service to the other side of the coin :) \n
25	Fuck yeah! You are awesome and a reminder that Myers-Briggs, like all tools of self-investigation, should ultimately aide towards your personal development. I like what you said about "sinking too far into being hot steaming messes". When you recognize yourself in a type, the tempting thing to do is to let your ego be stoked by the positive attributes and allow yourself to "sink in" to the negative attributes. Ultimately, your type should be a challenge to you to transcend your type. It's been theorized, and I believe it, that the most developed individuals of any type are also the hardest to type because they are the ones who have come the farthest in integrating the cognitive functions that don't come naturally to them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou gave me a lot of news I can use, OP! I'm on my journey to minimalism too. It's amazing what an uncluttered field does to clear your mind!
8	Cheers to you buddy! I highly relate to this post. I wonder if it is common for ENFPs to develop this side of them more as they grow older.
7	I'll throw in my two cents, and this is sort of a follow up to my post on the other thread. \nI think that I work hard to try to be someone that people can take seriously. I don't identify as manic pixie or a unicorn. I want to genuinely contribute to society, not just be some entertaining peacock who can't hold a job down for more than two weeks. I actually like ESTJs and get along with them well. I don't have a problem with authority.  I'm not rebellious or free-spirited. (Well, maybe a little free-spirited). \n\nI think a lot of ENFPs would do well to develop their Te as well as some Fe. It will work wonders in your life. \nNow, I DO struggle with self-discipline, so in that respect, I think I relate to some of the younger ENFPs. I also 100% fit the stereotype of the person whose interests change practically every month. But since I know that about myself, I make a conscious effort to make myself finish things I start and follow through.  I want to overcome my impulsive nature. 
4	Bravo ü§òüèº in depth and prompt/concise 
6	28f. Could have written this myself. \n\nDitsy has never been used to describe me as far as I'm aware. As a young kid I was always good at school. In high school I was known for being very opinionated and wanting to change things for the better. I loved talking about social issues and politics (still do). I also very much have a goofy silly side (don't most people though?) But I have my shit sorted, am self aware, and mature.
8	Jupp. That's also more like I See myself to be honest. \n\nI am Not very manic-pixie. Actually, I am a very logical Person. With growing older I get less overwhelmed by outbursts of feelings since I learn to rationalize and validate them with the exterior world.\n\nI am however very passionate, but it's a serious passion. Not silly or manic but I am convinced that my convictions are correct and I want to Transport that in a logical constructive manner.\n\nBeing pixie-manic is great,too. It's Just really not who I am.\n\nVery happy to See that I am Not alone. Maybe it's experience?
4	Enjoyed reading this, i'm very similar, just not very emotional.\nI understand you staying quiet when trying to comfort or help someone. I've started doing this more to prevent myself launching into a story about myself to relate to their problem. I cringe at myself sometimes üò£\nGreat to know people have the same challenges!\n
5	I truly relate to your post, especially the summarizing part. I do it a lot, sometimes even to a fault, as I can shorten up too many details. It is super important to me that everybody can understand an idea in a clear and concise way, by choosing the right words to describe it, especially at work.\n\nThis, fellow ENFPs, is a skill that can earn us the respect of our counterparts! It is also why we often end up leading a team when no one else volunteers. In the end, we manage to encourage creative ideas in a structured framework - and it's awesome!
4	Yes!! All of this!! Bubbly, friendly, happy, but not dumb or vapid. Chatty and good at small talk, but equally happy to have a deep conversation about many, many things. I might flit from one project to another, but when I do something I want to do it right. So I take my time to learn the skills and come back to things when I know I can accomplish it. I don't give up, I just set it aside for a while. \n\n\n\n\n\nI am not personally a very ambitious person. I find fulfillment helping people, and that's okay. Somebody once told me some people are like flowers, they find their place and put down roots. While other people are like the bees, they go from flower to flower. Helping. Spreading their knowledge, picking up new skills, and just making the world better wherever they land. I'm happy to be a bee. 
4	Thank you for showing up for the healthy side of ENFP! I could have probably done this, but I didnt feel like putting my mind to it (lol this is a truth joke). I'm glad someone did!\n\nAlthough I do struggle with people taking me for a ditz if I show them my fun going side which really bothers me. I'm not a ditz, but I can have fun. Yes, I know how to be playful but I still wish to be taken seriously ffs.
2	What kind of career path did you take if you don't mind me asking? I am a young ENFP that finished college, yet I am still trying to find my place in this world on that front. Great insight!
1	I relate to this as well, as an ENFP nearing 30. I often wonder if I come across as ‚Äútoo intense‚Äù whereas i think in my younger days,  people saw me as too silly. 
1	>For example, my wardrobe is now mostly interchangeable, high-quality neutrals.\n\nHAHAHAHA I actually laughed at my desk at work reading this. As I'm currently wearing black boots, dark jeans, a gray and black sweater, and a black hat. 
12	Emotions	Do any of you ENFPs understand emotions?\n\nFor the most time, I joke that it would be great to flirt with ENFPs daily, because I only find you online. I met probably 3-4 of you in life, but not since MBTI.\n\nIt‚Äôs like romance is a great high, but that crash? Brutal!\n\nI keep mostly to myself, but ALL emotions have been filtered through music. Every moment of life could be filtered down to a specific song at a specific moment.\n\nBeing alone is great, until a song triggers those emotions.\n\n\nYour (not-so-)secret admirer,\nINTJ
3	XNTJs are great! \n\nI have many XNTJs in my life. Two of my best friends ar INTJs. \n\nMy partner is an ENTJ and we are the perfect match! The conversation is always lively, the romance, Ah-mazing!\n\nThe best thing is that ENFPs have an appetite to opening people up! Don't be afraid to go deep, we love those conversations. \n\nHope this helps, reach out to your nearest ENFP IRL or online.
1	Interesting perspective. My emotions kind of control me some of the time. Elaborate more on the high/ crash of romance? 
1	Hi\n\nYes, we ENFPs, do understand emotions. \n\nPersonally, the emotional world may be the one where I feel the most at ease / skilled to navigate.\n\nCould you be more specific ?\n\nWhich song does trigger your emotions ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for your admiration, we need it badly ;)
4	DESCRIBES ME PERFECTLY	I'm not sure if everyone who identifies as ENFP and watches this video will agree, but I can certainly say\nthat I relate to every trait listed. Interested/excited to hear if others here feel the same or feel differently. :)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/EaMIWiY1a5A
5	wow, I got 35 out of 35...
4	Maybe it's the aesthetics, but this video came off as a bit reductive. I agreed with everything, but I'm really fed up with the portrayal of a a fun loving people person. Again, it could be that the visual aesthetic is just overdone, but I think it's limiting to view us that way. Maybe the view other people have of me as friendly and enthusiastic is self inflicted, but intellectually, I prefer things that are a bit more deep and less flashy. 
2	Holy shit! I'm speechless! I definitely relate! Where was this video in my teenage years? 
2	Me too!
2	Why are INTJs our so-called soulmates?	I've always heard ENFPs praising INTJs to no end, but I've never understood it. Two of my friends are INTJs and I must say, I don't particularly like them. One was my close friend but she started to get very competitive and gossiped about everyone else in the clique so they wouldn't get a leadership position. She also ostracised and is influencing others to ostracise one other schoolmate. The other was my deskmate and she got annoyed at the littlest things and was very uptight. A common trait I see in both of them is that when they speak they're unnecessarily harsh, they play favourites a lot, they don't care about the person's feelings, and they're pretty critical.\n\nOf course, I don't mean to put down INTJs because I'm sure they are wonderful people and generalising all INTJs to be like this would be unfair. However, my experience with INTJs have just been not the best, so I'm struggling to see what in INTJs do ENFPs like so much. I do know that these traits of them aren't necessarily attributed to being INTJ, but I can't help but feel that way because they're quite similar. I wonder if anyone could satiate this curiosity of mine?
5	First of all a soulmate would usually be someone of your own type who is very similar to yourself. \n\nSecond the INTJ you describe seem unhealthy or at least have some strongly accented weaknesses. Also from the context of the text it seems you and them are (or were) still young and undeveloped .\n\nA healthy well developed ENFP will tend to display traits of the enneagram 5 type which INTJs usually are (if not necessarily). \n\nIf I listen to or watch  healthy INTJs they share the same idealism and are interested in great things for the sake of those things while keeping themselves out of the picture (except they put all their heart and work into aiding the purpose and achieving the desirable beautiful outcome). \n\nHealthy ENFPs are similar and can separate their ego from the love they feel for things just for the sake of the thing and it's beauty. \n\nAnd don't get me started on unhealthy ENFPs they might be some of the people I dislike the most (and it takes quite something to be deeply disliked by us ENFPs).
2	Pivots and changes the subject not to ENFPs and INTJs but another similar type dyanamic with ESFPs and ISTJs.  It is related for it is the same type dynamic.\n\nWhat was your opinion of Ross and Rachel in Friends?  ^(*Keeps my own thoughts about this TV couple private till I hear your thoughts üòÉ, will share later.*)\n\nThere is a similar type dynamic with ENFPs and INTJs.
2	Well it depends on each individual. But from my experience, XNTJs are special to ENFPs because we both notice each others and understand the other person's motives/what the other person is trying to do, without so much explanation. Like we just effortlessly know. There is so much unspoken compassion. We would be interested in the same things (philosophy, ideas, future, hidden truth etc.).\n\nAlso they are like ENFPs' reverse version, what you would have become if you are being dead serious (Te); and you're their version when they loosen up (Fi). You secretly want their strengths and so do they (usually the mature INTJs would admit how much they want to explore emotions as freely as we are, or at least this is what my XNTJ best friends said).\n\nWell, Idk to be honest. I think because they actually listen to us, lol.
6	Share a story!	Maybe it's just me but I love hearing stories from people about odd things that happen in their daily lives. So I thought I'd open up a post to see if someone wanted to share anything. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTell me a story if you want!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. do other ENFPs find stories interesting? 
9	My mum sent me a picture of her cat today, he just got shaved and looked miserable. So of course I turned around to my coworkers and said "do u guys wanna see my mums shaved pussy?" \nNo one laughed, there were a few screams though. I'm about 95 percent sure they already think I'm a huge weirdo, this definitely set me back lol.\nTough crowd\n
3	I‚Äôm ENFP and I love stories so I hear to see others‚Äô stories 
1	So, I have anxiety, but usually it's not very bad. Today, however, it was astronomical. While at work (coffeeshop), I passed a table as I was headed to clean a restroom. The girl sitting at the table quickly turned to me saying "Hey! What's the wifi password?" I gasped a little, but gave her the password, then all but ran to the bathroom I was about to clean. I was so startled that I started crying, ran back across the shop to our storage room, & almost hyperventilated laugh-crying at myself for being so ridiculous. It took me at least ten minutes of imagining calm waves to get myself together. The good news is all my coworkers are also my friends & the other barista I was with today gives the best hugs. 
1	I recently joined Bumble dating app, I'm not a veteran on these things because I always met women/girls in real life, avoiding chats and similar things. I got some matches, quickly bored about them, but I kept a very interesting one. The chat was really async (eg: me writes now, she replies the day after) but I think it's ok (even if I must resist to _idealize romantically with no real reason_). After some day she mostly disappeared (maybe ghosting? I thought), but I knew she was enough busy. Time passes, I didn't resist the silence. So I picked David Bowie's Space Oddity and adapted the lyrics so that I was doing the part of "ground control" and she was "the major HER-NAME". _Few minutes later_ she replied with her phone number.\n\nThose are the kind of crazy improvised things I do when I'm inspired, and I enjoy them a lot!
1	Oh noooo, I love stories and sharing but I couldn't think of anything just now and then my dumb brain jumped to "oh wow, you must be so boring, blah blah." Talk about a backfire! Ugh, dumb brain...
8	My emotional state yesterday vs. today lol	
2	Yes
1	Which one is good?
1	Me too!!!!!! I woke up like a different person today. Thanks for backing off, hormones! üòù
4	Healthy ENFP	Just saw this over on INFJ for their type, what do you guys consider traits of a healthy or well developed ENFP?
12	* I think, a well developed ENFP is opposed to commmon beliefs quite assertive.\n* balances high emotionality with a can-do attitude and a lot of optimism\n* empathetic but not self consuming in a authentic and relatable way\n* knows how to set functional boundaries\n* knows how the world works and how to present himself in every occasion\n* doesnt need constant attention or validation because he sees his own worth\n* ... there is a lot more, I suppose
21	The Ditzy Dilemma	So, I've always, always, always struggled with coming off as a ditzy and I feel like some of you may be able to relate to that. It's actually a little frustrating. I'm a really outwardly friendly person, I think that everything is at least a little funny and I'm always giggling about something. I'm also a little forgetful and I de-rail super fast. I always get back on topic but if I have a cool little side story, I just haave to tell it in name of spicing the conversation up a little. \n\nAll of this combined leads to a lot of people assuming I'm a ditz or just dumb. It's a little frustrating because I'm really not. I'm super creative, passionate, and friendly. I can be really smart when I'm really into something and I have a bunch of knowledge that I picked up from different people/experiences/places. It just really irritates me when someone assumes I'm dumb just because I'm super friendly. Like no, I'm not a ditz, I'm just overly nice because the world really needs it lol. \n\nDo any of you relate to this? Have you ever been considered ditzy or dumb? Why do you think so? Does it bother you or are you chill about it? \n\nAlso, if you aren't considered ditzy, why not? Tell me your secrets! 
10	I feel bad for female ENFPs since this is usually a stereotype for them. As a guy, people generally don't assume that I'm dumb. Some friends come to me for insights they can't get from other friends, the friends I have value how I think. However I am still rather "childlike" and sometimes I let it show at work functions, much to other people's enjoyment when they see me being more expressive than usual. 
6	I was always considered a ditz because I just like to have fun and be silly. I'm not particularly mad at being called one because I look at it like, everyone is having a good time and if I'm able to enhance that by being my extroverted and ditzy self, I'll be happy. Unless, of course, they start talking down to me, which rarely happens because I only unleash this side of me if I'm comfortable with everyone or at least majority of people around.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: my grammarz r bad
5	I actually think it's fun when people underestimate my intelligence. I'm also a fan of surprising people with a smarty-pants sneak attack because sometimes they get so awkwardly uncomfortable that you can almost feel radiate off of them. \n\nI live for the "oh, fuck..." moment of realization from the other party. Yeah, I'm a silly, goofy fucker but I'm also pretty fuckin smart. I dial back the goofiness when necessary, but somewhere along the way I just stopped feeling the need to prove my intelligence to people at every turn. I'm confident enough to know that when someone underestimates me, they'll eventually be fairly surprised.\n\n
3	People will not understand us... and that's okay. \n\nRegardless,\n\nWe have to love ourselves first \n\nWe do what we do in this broken world...\n\nBring energy to people's lives, have fun, and see people smile ! \n\n&#x200B;
2	(22 F here) I‚Äôm considered really outgoing and friendly. I too can ramble and go off track , I laugh at everything and I‚Äôve always had people say I have a ‚ÄúCute‚Äù personality. I love people and I get along with almost everyone. There hasn‚Äôt been many times where I feel like my intelligence has been questioned. But when my intelligence IS questioned , I go off and tell them like it is. It‚Äôs honestly how you carry yourself. I don‚Äôt let people fuck with me or disrespect me. If something bothers me , I say it.  When you come off as TOO nice and friendly , people will think you‚Äôre stupid. It‚Äôs just how people are , and if you want respect you need to speak up. 
2	I get this a lot! Honestly, I don't care really if people think I'm dumb. I just roll with it and keep being myself, even when I can tell people are interpreting my super friendly/joking personality as being dumb. I know I'm not and I find it more fun to surprise them later on and make them change how they think of me :)
2	I think as well because we have so much fun we get distracted with the energy and the moment sometimes we forget to build our academic side up. Well that's what it was like for me growing up! Its like we stop to smell the Rose's and realise that everyone kept on walking!\n\nBut we do, and doesn't mean that we aren't as intelligent as other types we just dont broadcast it to the world, and when I think about it, we only know that we are acting silly or ditzy because someone brought it up and probably told us.\n\nSide note you all need to read the "the four agreements' by don miguel Ruiz I think the name is.\n\nBut wouldn't you rather smell those beautiful Rose's?
1	Ahh same battle here. I just started a new job and I'm trying to be all professional and grown up. Every now and then I ramble on a little too much and come out with something silly or start telling them my life story üòÇ\nI wish I could just shut up sometimes!
1	YESSSSSSSSSSSS
1	Is this actually something I wrote in the past because I relate to this 100%. Absolutely everything you‚Äôre saying. 
1	This was an ongoing situation with me when I was younger.  I constantly had guys thinking I was dumb and gals thinking I was disorganized and flirty.  I‚Äôll assume they felt this way because I had a ‚Äúbubbly‚Äù personality, I talked to anyone and I did not want to alienate people so dumbed myself down.  As an over 30 adult, I found out I was actually highly intelligent but low on esteem for myself.  I dated guys who were not intellectually stimulating and worked in jobs that were soul-crushing for me.  All the while wondering what was ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with me and why I was so unhappy in these situations when other people seemed to take them in stride in their daily lives. I was looking for external forces to fix whatever it was I felt was wrong with me.  I now realize I‚Äôm just a typical ENFP and there are many others that share my feelings and views.  That‚Äôs very comforting on many levels because not fitting in and having people ‚Äúget‚Äù you is very frustrating. 
11	Overwhelmed lol	Hi!!!!\n\nDo you ever get overwhelmed bc so many people want your attention at the same time and your natural instinct is to never neglect anyone who wants your attention??\n\nI have had this problem at my last two social work jobs! I think as ENFPs we are extremely social and accepting and affirming, and then people eat that up! And then you‚Äôre in a trap where everyone wants your attention and you forget what you‚Äôre supposed to do and it‚Äôs hard to process what everyone is saying and remember what you were trying to do in the first place. Lol. Can anyone relate?\n\nI‚Äôm working on ‚Äúdisciplining‚Äù ie saying that it is rude to interrupt, but I don‚Äôt want anyone to feel invalidated! It‚Äôs a strugg. 
8	Totally relate to this. But I learned the following:\n\n- even if I feel like a superhero, nobody should know it :-P\n- sometimes I have to say NO when I already know I can‚Äôt OR I see they‚Äôre relying too much only on me\n- not all the people you help, will eventually help you when you‚Äôll need them. So I choose carefully.
1	Yes!!
1	&#x200B;\n\nSo true... lol. \n\n...Need back up \n\nSOS 
1	Plan some time for solitude maybe? 
1	You need that spirit stick Jessica day had in her class, only the bearer can speak lol 
9	What is your ideal Valentine‚Äôs Day date?	This can be an extensively detailed day, or just a simple date. I‚Äôm curious as to how other ENFPs would ideally want to spend their Valentine‚Äôs Day if it was with a partner. 
14	Picnic with cheese, crackers, pesto dip, strawberries, Whittakers chocolate and cider. Read to each other. Cuddle.\n\nA leisurely walk talking. \n\nComedy show or a musical theatre show. Cocktails and dessert afterwards. Go home and have a lot of sex.
9	Sex in a manga comic book store bathroom. 
6	Nothing, Valentine's Day is overrated
6	Sneaky public sex in many places throughout the day while having fun inbetween and going to a nice theatre by the end of it. Sneaky handjob would be in order.
4	My INFP boyfriend coming home, reminding me that it's Valentines day (which I probably forgot), me inviting him to our usual Restaurant and him Not being depressed for an evening.\n\nWell let's say the last one is a must, the Rest a nice to have.
4	Spending the day together ...most likely in bed,  keeping busy... :) 
5	14 FEB 2019.
109	today I painted my nails for the first time and drew on a tattoo I've been thinking of getting. wanted to share my excitement with other ENFPs :)	
20	Ah you look like you love yourself so much, this is amazing
12	Fyi when doing your nails: base coat of clear polish, dry, color polish, dry, top coat of clear polish, dry. Last forever. I have being doing my nails for 25-26 years and I only just this last year learned how amazing this is, when my cousin showed me the proper way to paint my nails. üòï

5	Am I the only one thinking that he is at high level of ‚úå
2	Nice! I've been wanting to get a tattoo too, just never gotten around to it lol
2	I did the same thing to myself the other night! First tattoo I would be getting. So nervous but excited! 
2	now, go treat yourself to both a mani and a new tat!!  direct order from another ENFP, so you must do it :) 
2	Nice man, I have my Grim Reaper playing bass on the other side of my chest among with a myriad of nautical tatts! 
2	this is the happiest thing on the internet today.  thank you! 
2	Cuute!! That‚Äôs a great idea to draw on a tattoo, maybe I‚Äôll try that out for a tattoo I‚Äôve also thought of getting.. :) whereabouts are you from if you don‚Äôt mind me asking? 
2	That polish color is bitchin‚Äô.
2	I‚Äôve been painting my nails for about a year and a half now (I‚Äôm an ENFP male) and I get a random compliment on my nails every so often and it makes me happy because I don‚Äôt usually receive compliments from strangers. 
1	You should paint them black instead 
1	ENFP and I‚Äôve got some tats in the same spot. 
1	Coucou petite perruche !
1	What nail polish did you use? I own one with very similar shade. And wow, it sure does fit you better than me\n\nAlso, that's an really cool idea for a tattoo, I love it!
1	I love the nail colour!!! Been looking for a purple like that. Which one did you use?
1	i thought you were tom hiddleston at first, i‚Äôm obsessed with him. by the way, love the nails!
1	If you want a good stating "tattoo" for a couple days/week check out inkbox, they have all kinds of premade tattoos but they also sell ink that you can draw on yourself\n\n&#x200B;
1	Do what?
-6	Why is this posted here? Completely irrelevant
-8	God.. why am I subscribed to this sub
-14	That's hella g4y
1	Is Kacey Musgraves‚Äô ‚ÄúHappy and Sad‚Äù not the most ENFP song ever?!	Just trying to understand myself better.\n‚ÄúHappy and sad at the same time, you got me smiling with tears in my eyes‚Äù
1	Yes maybe it is, I think she‚Äôs an isfp 
5	ENFPs and ADHD: What are your experiences?	If you're diagnosed with ADHD, I'd like to hear about your experiences, what meds you may or may not take, and how your meds affect you. I'll go first:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was diagnosed about 6 months ago with ADHD, primarily inattentive type (I'm not hyperactive). I have a really hard time managing my time and getting anything done. I procrastinate in such unhealthy ways it affects my ability to live my life. Because I wasn't diagnosed as a child, it was really hard to get anyone to give me the diagnosis. They said I was depressed and had anxiety. This is probably also true, but if I'm depressed it's a high functioning one for sure. Finally, I applied to OVR (Office of Vocational Rehabilitation) on the suggestion of my therapist to get help with keeping a stable job (I had lost my previous job due to poor performance and low numbers and several mistakes in regards to data entry, which isn't what my job was entirely about but that was important). \n\nMy OVR counselor decided to send me to get a comprehensive psychological evaluation that took all day, but after all was said and done, it was found that:\n\nA.) I definitely had ADHD\n\nB.) My IQ was 130, which is why I was never suspected growing up of having ADHD, I simply worked around it and was able to "mask" it. I had trouble getting homework done, always did projects last minute, and often spaced out in class, but because I could answer the question when my suspecting teaching called me out (and my grades were A's and B's until senior year), no one suspected a thing. However, the fact that I could no longer keep up with advanced classes like Music Theory and Calculus should have been a sign. I also ended up not going to college because my grades suddenly plummeted that year and I made C's, D's and F's.\n\nUnfortunately for me, it took until I was 31 to get a diagnosis and get some treatment.\n\nMy first trial was with Adderall. I found that didn't do anything for me, even with the dosage bumped up. We then went with Vyvanse, which works great...when it works. My issue is that is seems to work for such a small period of time. I'm already at 40mg and my doctor doesn't think bumping up the dose is going to help any more than it already is. It kind of sucks. :/
3	I could have written this.. uncanny. Diagnosed 6 months ago. I have ADD, and I take 300mg Wellbutrin...noticed a small improvement only. Getting frustrated to be honest..it certainly impairs my life
3	I've taken Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse, and Modafinal over the past 3/4 years. I stopped sometimes in between because I liked them too much...\n\nI found that doing one XR pill in the AM, and then one smaller IR pill later in the day worked when I was in school. I do not believe Vyvanse has an IR. Adderall and Ritalin both do.\n\nI started working out about 2.5 years ago consistently, and that has dramatically helped decrease brain fog and increase focus. I try to work out 5 days a week.\n\nOther than that... therapy. Which it sounds like you're doing. Make daily goals. That helps me. The night before, or in the morning, I'll write down the goals I have for the next day/today. Then at the end of the day I'll reflect to see what I did and did not accomplish, and try to comprehend why I didn't accomplish some of my goals. I try to understand where my head was at. It helps keep me accountable. I don't want to let myself down.
2	Sorry, I don't have much help to offer here, other than to just say: it's seriously weird how similar our stories are. Maybe it's something to do with the fact that we're ENFP that had us handle these situations like this?\n\nInattentiveness without hyperactivity, anxiety, adderall moving onto vyvanse (which worked a lot better), high IQs that prevented our ADHD from being recognized at an early age, and eventual underperformance in the college level as success became less about your immediate intelligence/ reasoning, and more about your ability to actually attend class and fulfill the assignments.\n\nNice to hear that I'm not alone in all this!
1	Bear with me, as you know us ENFPs love to waffle on! Haha\n\nI recently started going to therapy, I've had only 2 sessions with this new therapist. She seems good and I'm excited about making progress with her. I've seen alot of time wasters. \n\nStraight up she said to me at the end of my session, that I couldn't sit still at all, but it was too early to make a concrete diagnosis yet. But it's either ADD or PTSD. Funnily enough she said that PTSD shows itself like ADD. \n\nMy eldest brother had ADHD and my other brother has Aspergers. \n\nMy brother at school was told all his life that he was stupid, had a low IQ, that he was never going to make it in life and to drop out in year 10 to do an apprenticeship. He did that, for ten years loathing every second of it. \n\nI remember when he was little all he ever wanted to do was to rip technology apart to see how it works. He did this with the Omega computer we had, TV, VCR etc. He had this passion for understanding how things work, and from the get go he was fabulous at it. School is catered towards one particular type of learning, academic. The kids out there that have minds like my brother, that learn with their hands/visually, they suffer. \n\nEventually he got the courage to leave his old trade and start an electrical trade at 31. He now owns his own company, he does mainly commercial and industrial work. Hes done electrical engineering also. I'm so proud of my brother, I actually call him the macgyver of electricians haha. \n\nWhen I spoke about the ADD thing with my mother, she said that she thought I had it when I was a kid, but didn't want me to identify with it.. \n\nIt definitely made it a real struggle growing up. Never wanting to focus, study, sit down in a class room for hours. It was torture for me. I used to wag alot, I was such a naughty kid! The trouble I used to get in, make hilarious stories now but back then I pure just wrecked their heads. \nBut sorta their fault right? Haha\n\nThe point I guess is that everyone's beautiful, unique and has got some issues. All you can be is honest and loving towards yourself. Give yourself an allowance, I find the procrastination is fed by negative self talk you probably tell yourself when you are procrastinating. As soon as the pressure is gone you can get on with life and what ever you need to tend to.\n\nWe all forget our power and what we are good at. Sit down and write a list.of things that make you happy, things your good at and see if it gives you any clues. I think the secret to our ADD OR ADHD is the perspective of looking at it. If you can find your passion with it, it gives you an edge that no one else will have! \n\nAlso side note, have tried ritalin it was ok. Modafinil I really liked, I was so dope at my job when I was taking it.  But I already only sleep like 5 hours on average, on modafinil even if I took it at 6am it gave me some trouble sleeping that night.\n
3	Presents are so mundane	I hate giving and receiving presents. Just the thought of it makes me wanna take a s***. It's not that I don't like a well thought present, I'd really appreciate one. The problem is that the majority of presents are thought on the spot and with little meaning so that they becomes merely a waste of money. Also, the idea that when someone invites you to a party/dinner you should somehow compensate with a gift of equal value just drives me crazy. What the heck guys, get you s*** together. If I want something I buy it with my own money. If you want to buy me something then it should possibly be something that has intrinsic value, such as a concert or a vacation (those are expensive though). Maybe, maybe, maybe a book (the subject of which should be coherent with the recipient of the gift). Is it only me and my overly idealistic sense of gifts or do you fellow ENFPs feel the same about them?
3	I enjoy to make gifts or compliments because I see people enjoys receiving them.\n\nHowever I hate receiving them, because I see it as a void gratification for me and I never understand why or if I should deserve it, after all.\n\nRegarding the dinners, it‚Äôs good etiquette, a sort of unwritten social rule for some people, not all. Also, it‚Äôs a kind act, especially if you do it with your good intentions. Otherwise, pick friends that don‚Äôt bother about it ;-)
3	Shit, the word is shit. 
2	you are completely right from the begining to the end
2	Is this an attack on Valentine's day?\n\nWarning to the people in the Aether that will some how karmically return the words I am about to write...someday.  I am not personally big on presents, but I do enjoy a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.  Furthermore I am always interested if there is any taste differences (including mouthfeel) of the Canadian Reese Peanut Butter Cup.
2	Saaame. Like great, I got something i don't need, wtf should I do with this now? 
3	Any advice on how to start finding your path?	Hello my fellow ENFP-ers. I know many of you must be or must have been where I am now. Basically over the past few years I've dealt with a very close death, divorce and leaving the religion I was born into. I'm now in a new city  and I'm at a place in my life where I can start directing energy into figuring out who I am and what I like. I currently do tech work but I know it's not my passion. Any tips you guys have that's helped you to start finding your place or purpose or passions? Hope you are all well wherever you are, thanks for reading!
1	I recommend going to your local library and see if they have the Design Your Life book, it helped me after college and listened to the Audiobook. I relisten to focus on exercises. Also start small focus on you. Self love and explore what you love and makes you happy. Being a part of group can help some, at gym, salon, reading club, something that will let you vent and see new faces. \n\n\nHere‚Äôs a link [for the book ](https://m.barnesandnoble.com/p/designing-your-life-william-burnett/1123383569/2676876149174?st=PLA&sid=BNB_Core+Catch-All,+Low&sourceId=PLAGoNA&dpid=tdtve346c&2sid=Google_m&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIj4Corbm54AIVov_jBx3cYwfoEAQYASABEgKEs_D_BwE)  
12	ENFP & Night Time Anxiety	Hi Friends, \n\nI am wondering if anyone else struggles with feelings of anxiety late at night or early in the morning. \n\nDuring the day, I'm usually busy being productive or socializing. I feel happy and generally excited about life during these times. After work, I like to do an extracurricular activity (a hobby class, fitness class or making a recipe). Again, I feel pretty good while I'm doing these things. \n\nHowever, once I'm done all activities - usually between 8 - midnight, a lot of anxiety kicks in. I try to unwind by watching TV, but feel heavy hearted. It's almost like the second I stop the "go-go-go", I feel a sense of "doom and gloom". I usually wake up feeling the same way and don't snap out of it until I start my workday. \n\nI'm wondering if anyone else can relate? And, more specifically, if anyone has any night time or morning routines that they found helped abide these feelings. \n\nThanks, everyone! 
7	There is a possibility it could be physical. See if you can get your magnesium and vitamin d levels checked.
3	For 10+ years I dreamt nightmares almost all time I remembered a dream in the morning. It stopped when I broke up my relationship.\n\nNow, it's been almost 2 years that _before falling asleep_, I get 20-30 seconds of intense anxiety/paranoia about bad things that could happen to my most loved ones.\n\nWell, I'm grown up enough to face it with a bit of _black humor_, I'm now used to it, so I just label those feelings as my *nightly anxiety moment*, I know when it comes in, I let it finish or I try to rationalize it as quick as possible.\n\nMy advice: keep calm, _embrace and estinguish it_ with rationality. Something like: `ok, this is anxiety, do I really have a reason to feel anxious? do I have something unfinished in my mind that needs processing?`. What's assured is: if you give too much space to anxiety, it will control you. Instead, you can somewhat control your anxiety in creative ways: you can joke about it with yourself, not taking it too seriously (I mean, anxiety is a serious issue, but you have to limit it in some way, right?) and focusing on things that matter.\n\nhope this might help. good luck.
2	I hate sleeping. It is the slow death. A place of loneliness and nightmares.  
1	Always hated sleeping for this exact reason. I rarely have dreams, only stressful nightmare that weed usually prevents me from fully remembering. I never ever felt right going to bed or getting up in the morning. It‚Äôs currently the morning for me and I wish I was dead. 
1	Yes! It's been there since all of my childhood trauma came up a couple of years ago. It started out really intense.. And has taken a lot of work and time to calm down. For me, the feelings that come up as I go to bed are closer to fear then anixety. \n\nFor me, a combination of physical and emotional work has slowly helped. Increase magnesium and melatonin before bed, and practice yoga (not a class, but being aware and feeling the feelings as physical, and moving in a way that releases them)    emotionally, try to figure out why you are scared and don't stop it, but find out what you need (usually for me to be held, to be told I am loved etc) and give that to yourself to the best of your ability. \n\nThis is 2 years of therapy and work packed into one paragraph so if you want to know something more specific, DM me. 
1	I feel that very much so whenever I have to sleep alone. Having been in long term relationships pretty much since I was 16, it‚Äôs hard for me to shut my mind down when I‚Äôm alone at night. It‚Äôs a quick spiral down anxiety lane. \n\nWhat I find (personally) helps is to cut caffeine and dairy at least 6 hours before bedtime... and to get a cat, LOL. I have my Cotton now and his purring is infinitely soothing. 
1	I super relate to this. I feel better if I am with people around then of if I am engaged in something (reading, writing, exercise... exercise being the least common)... For me It extends into weekends/days off though when I don't have plans. \n\nJournaling has also helped. I'm religious, so prayer and studying scriptures helps me too.
18	ENFP's Do you ever look at some posts in this forum and think...	This isn't at all like me, and have a hard time relating to our own types posts? if so, what?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\*Update\* I didn't mean to imply anything negetive towards any enfps here, as I am one too :) just haven't been relating lately
13	I relate to this.
21	Yes. And imo lowkey this sub is super cringy. Like, I'm a capable and hardworking adult... Not a fucking unicorn. We're not all mentally 12 years old and obsessed with cats. üòë I think I just use Te a lot more than Fi. \n\nEdit: I didn't expect this comment to be at the top so I want to clarify something. I don't have a problem with people who are manic pixie, cat loving unicorns. If that's you and you're an ENFP, cool! The thing that irks me is when that stereotype gets extended to all ENFPs, which I think is certainly not accurate. There are lots of ENFPs who don't identify with that and, to me, it's annoying that people think that that's all we are. Now, as for saying that this sub in cringy, I think any sub for a type with strong Ne is going to come off as cringy sometimes. There are just so many different people with different interests and ideas of things to post that, yeah, you're bound to see something that you think is cringy. 
8	I admit that 90-95% of the posts I read in this sub I usually think: been/being there, done/doing that. Sometimes it's also a matter of culture, age, gender and background. \n\nAs a context: I'm 41M, discovered this stuff less than 2 weeks ago BUT I've spent a lot of my life doing introspection and trying to figure out what kind of person I am, and why I feel/act so _different_ in many situations.\nI also have a sociology degree, so I'm not totally new to social psychology, communication, body language or cognitive stuff. I'm pretty good at reading/guessing people, without using the _mbti framework_.\n\nWhat I see here (and other mbti subs) very often is that people is obsessed with this stuff just like it's so important to be on type rather than another, or using their type as an _excuse_ to explain things about themselves or, worst, using it as a sort of x-ray to understand others.\n\nInstead, I think that mbti should be used as tool to understand themselves and try to fix (potential) issues.
8	I have been on many ENFP forums over the years and I have realized I am not as bubbly as the average ENFP. I am a very strong EN&P so I thought maybe I was a T because I generally don't let my feelings get in the way of logic (so long as logic doesn't conflict with my moral compass) So I followed some ENTP forums as well. I couldn't relate at all. I was so far out of the loop. So, I went back to the ENFP forums, where I was so close yet just kind of to the left.\n\n With that said, when I start my cult, I would love to have some ENTPs to help with the doomsday machine and brainwashing elixir.\n\nI will never be the peacock with vibrant iridescent feathers that has such a beautifully positive outlook on life, that I am envious of. I will always be the peacock with chard, blacken feathers, stitched together rusty wire, and mismatching button eyes. But I will always come to ENFP forums because it is one of the few places that remind me of my self.
5	This isn't at all like me, and I have a hard time relating to this own type post.
5	Generally when I feel like I can't relate, it's because the ENFP in question seems like an Enneagram 7 type. I mean I can relate superficially, but it doesn't really hit my core the way a 4 type ENFP would. We're not all the same. Someone in the comments mentioned being more logical and rational. I'm probably not, but compared to other ENFPs, I feel like it. Also, I tend to speak to other people in a blunt manner and often times, I find myself strangely cold and unsympathetic to someone's emotional outbursts if I think they are being completely irrational (though I try a little to hide this and appear warmer >.> ). I've hurt many an xxTJ's feelings because I incorrectly assume they can handle my bluntness. \n\nOn the other hand, I can be far more emotional and empathetic than other people towards certain things. I'm more serious with people I'm really close to and more of a clown with people I'm not.
3	I was in an ENFP discord for about a week, and I couldn‚Äôt stand it after a while. People spamming in caps and emojis, vying for attention with the wittiest comment, lots of selfies...had to leave for my own sanity. This sub can be very similar in content. 
2	Yeah man! ENFPs I meet are way too sensitive for my taste. I am sensitive too, in large degree, but I never let my strong feelings get in the way of objective facts.
2	I am a lot different from my ENFP friends and some of the posts on this sub. I'm less emotional, have never struggled with mental health or anxiety, At the same time, it doesn't bother me in the slightest that these things get posted, and to the people who are saying the posts on this sub are "cringey".... Unsubscribe? It takes less effort to unsubscribe than it does to make a post talking about how you don't enjoy the sub.
1	Yes. There are absolutely posts to which I relate from the bottom of my soul, but when spending a lot of time here, it starts being too much sunshine and rainbows and/or relationship madness. It's overwhelming and really not that relatable.
3	Late night thoughts	As the days we don't see each other stack up \nyou start to forget about me\n but I miss you\nmore each day. \n\nWhile the little you felt fades away,\nwhat I feel only grows stronger. \n\nWish it made sense\nWish I could stop feeling\n\nWish I could just find the one whi felt as I do\nSomeone where there is no game to play\nWhere we are just ourselves\nAnd no matter the mistakes \nOr the gaps between dates\nWe want to be together. \n\nBut you aren't her, \nAnd so you will also fade away \nI'll run after you\nBut I'll only fall before I reach you\nIt will hurt\nBut I'll stand up\nAnd as I watch you vanish\nI will walk towards another place\n\nAnd I know I will be alright\nI'll be happy no matter what\n\nI just wish you could be happy here with me.\n
2	Bro, the less women get to be with you the more they want you, just be attractive and post cool shit on social media so they keep seeing your mug from time to time doing fun shit. They'll start msging you themselves.
5	Typed colleagues at work today	So today at work with my older ESTJ colleague, we typed everyone in the office together... it was actually really fun cuz I love talking MBTI and it reminded me that I‚Äôm an intuitive swimming in a see of wonderful sensors :) \n\nIt‚Äôs great because it makes a lot of sense with my role as a graphic designer for a college fundraising/donor relations team. 
3	I forced my whole team to take the test a few months back and it turns out 3 out of 7 of us were ENFPs üòπüòπ I could have guessed one other but the third is slightly more reserved so I wouldn‚Äôt have pinned her for one of us! Very eye opening. 
19	Comparing yourself?	Do you ever find yourself as an ENFP, comparing yourself all the time?\n\nI don‚Äôt consider myself competitive, but there are days where I feel like I do this.\n
6	Literally never. It usually doesn‚Äôt even cross my mind to compare myself to others - to the point where it makes me feel a little off. 
4	I do it all the time. Though, it could be attributed to my upbringing. Did your parents compare you to other kids? I am trying to understand if it is an ENFP thing or an environmental factor.
5	Endlessly, though for me (comparing myself to other men) it could be a gay thing?\n\nI have been known to obsess a little over someone if I find they're ideal, and feel worse as a result.
1	Whenever I don‚Äôt feel good enough
1	I do it a lot. Usually to highlight my failures when I'm feeling low. I have a distinct "logical brain" that will actively try and counteract the "emotional/irrational brain" when it happens (probably from therapy I've gotten in the past) but I haven't figured out how to make the emotion pass and empower myself with that logical side yet. It's all a progress.\n\nAlso, I tend to compare myself to an ideal nobody. I never use this standard on anyone else, just myself. \n\nI have also wondered if this was a personality thing or an experience thing.
1	Everyday, in any which way. I will harshly critique myself on all levels, and even when I am hard on myself I feel like as an ENFP it is more to better myself than to feel low about who I am. It's just a thing at this point in my life I do all the time. 
1	Nope, I don't care what other people are doing unless it looks fun or I can learn from it/them.\n\nI am highly competitive when it comes to work, though. Not so much with other people but more so with myself. I do find that I get annoyed if I find out someone is accomplishing more than me. It just means I have to push myself harder. Infact, I get invigorated by the competition and will jump at the chance to help them, especially if I can learn from them. But I still really don't compare myself to them because I don't operate on the same wavelength as other people. It is like comparing bananas and walnuts... Or I am constantly comparing myself to others, wondering why I can't open this walnut with a banana. It maybe a subconscious thing I am not admitting to or acknowledging. <shrugs> I have never giving it much thought until now.\n\n
1	I don't consider myself competitive all the time, but when it's something I care about I become extremely competitive, unless I already know I lost then I become passive and feel like shit for some time. I compare myself to others because I want to improve and become the best I can be.
4	How do you enjoy your own company?	Hey Guys! \n\nWhat kind of things do you do at home to enjoy your own company? I have a pretty good idea of how to keep myself happy outside of the house: being productive, going on adventures, fitness classes, hobby classes, and socializing. But, when I sit by myself at home, I have a tough time feeling satisfied and fulfilled. Any ideas for at-home hobbies or time-fills?\n\nThanks! <3 
8	Drawing, reading, cooking, origami, photography, Browsing reddit, watching youtube videos on: photography, cooking, origami, or random nonsense. \n \nBut my favorite thing to do by myself is trying to think of something or doing something to make myself laugh out loud or at least, give myself giggle fits. Which is why I started:\n\nDrawing faces on fruit. \n\nHaving dance battles with myself. \n\nWinning imaginary arguments in imaginary court rooms. \n\nWhile taking a shower, I like to pretend I forgot how to shower and then flail about wildly, so I don't drown (some times I say I don't want to die like this or why is happening to me). \n\nTesting to see if I have developed super powers: trying to blow things up with my mind, trying to turn invisible, trying see through walls.
2	As an INFP, I find this struggle fascinating.\n\nMaybe you can watch a hobby stream on Twitch while doing hobby stuff? It‚Äôs sorta like having a companion at home, maybe? Except you can‚Äôt talk to them. There‚Äôs chat though.\n\nThey have categories like ‚Äúmakers and crafting‚Äù and ‚Äúart‚Äù and ‚Äúmusic and performing arts‚Äù.\nThat‚Äôs assuming you don‚Äôt like video game streams.
2	What could you do in the next 10 minutes to make your home better ?\n\nIn the last month I have found great joy again in my introverted time. \nJust thinking (of course I need some great thinking material beforehand. But our Ne will always provide that) or lying down listening to music/podcasts . \n\nCleaning up my room helps me to be in a better mood and a more inspired state right away (but don't tell my 18y old self that he will hate me for it).\n\nJust writing some ideas down usually gets me started to do something else intirely as well. And a mind dump (just google it) is long overdue for me as well. 
2	I go for a walk, I skip through my phone, I reorganize my future and what I want to do...\n\nIt's important we also meditate and learn how to just be, without doing anything. I can forget sometimes that, and I get stressed because I have nothing to do! How crazy is that? Not being able to relax and stop doing anything, that, is a mental-illness we all share.
1	ENFP here,  I love to play video games and work on my music. (It‚Äôs my career but I really love it).  I find myself to need some small amounts of human contact fairly often,  but usually trying to focus on bettering myself is part of how I keep my own company.  You are your own worst critic and best motivator.  
90	I've never felt so "seen" in my entire life	
22	At the same time, the more I talk deeply with other mature or maturing people, the more I find I have in common.\n\nYes, I'm still pretty unique, but on deep down parts of me I'm finding others deal with a lot of the same feelings.\n\nI think part of me wants to be different, but this also means I feel isolation, and part of me wants to find things in common, because I know there are healthy things to be found there.\n\nWhat I think I'm realizing is that different doesn't have to mean seperated or distant, and that perhaps the best thing I'm most different in is one thing that can be helpful and valuable to others: putting words to things they've felt but haven't been able to articulate, helping their inside parts find a voice. 
22	Which is why I don't even try to fit in anymore, just do what's genuine
17	Yep. I just embrace my weird and find my tribe. 
15	I don‚Äôt like this attitude at all. People aren‚Äôt mindless drones. Yeah, we might hate the casual small talk and boring day to day lives, but it‚Äôs not like others love it. Let‚Äôs take the optimistic approach. We are the people that BRING others out of accepting that mundane living sucks. We have the power to do that. Don‚Äôt ‚Äúfind the others‚Äù, be yourself for everyone. Be a role model for confident, individual living. 
12	Don't really agree with calling anyone not like you "mindless"... and acting like you're the only unique person out here.\n\nI get being yourself can feel isolating sometimes but literally everyone feels that way ENFP or not. This could be posted on literally every single MBTI subreddit and they'd all say "so me" and it'd be just as... not very insightful every time.\n\nAnd I'm saying this as someone who's on this sub because I test ENFP. I thought we were supposed to be good at understanding and relating to people? This feels like the opposite, and kind of a childish view of the world.
6	Cringe. What a bullshit comic, please don't fall into the trap of narcissism 
4	Damn, this is so accurate! Gonna look into Timothy Leary a bit more 
2	Your INFP friends would like a word with you...\n\nBut not in a group. Maybe just one on one.
2	Ahhhh omg I almost cried reading this! I have yet to find the "others" but it's comforting knowing that other people like me exist lol
1	I love this! Thank you! üíú
1	Felt like this my ENTIRE childhood, finally accepted who I am, and I couldn't imagine trying to be anyone else at this point. Big thing about ENFP, we just wanna be UNDERSTOOD. And when we feel like someone truly does, it's the BEST feeling in the world! Like you've been mute your entire life but finally someone can hear you. Sounds dramatic, but true.
32	How to save a dying unicorn	How to help a depressed ENFP out? 
22	I love the title :)
12	time. i am as authentically ENFP as one can be and i‚Äôve learned to just be during those periods where we go emo. It is not your responsibility to provide bubbles and smiles to the world.. we must take that time to fill up our own cups and if you find a few very special friends who see you for all the you you really are, they are your rocks when you are a you that is less fun for them. \n\nit is ok to not be happy. it is ok to be grumpy. it is ok to exist in whatever state you are and to let it be what it is and nothing more. give it no more attention than it deserves by resisting it. \n\namor fati. 
8	For me, I need to get my feelings out. I normally get depressed when I feel like something is too big to handle & then I just avoid feeling about it. Recovering normally requires some intense crying and maybe therapy session to talk about my feelings or a movie that is similar to my experience. Like if i'm feeling bad about communication with my dad watching a movie about communicating with a dad.
17	Your mileage may SERIOUSLY vary, but a couple times per year, I take some mushrooms and think about my path and future. I find it helps me stay motivated and directed. \n\nYou **must** be in the mindset of directing your trip, and focusing it on positivity and growth. 
8	GET A DOG. I would still be a depressed heap in my parents house if not for my dog. He brought me back from rock bottom and still helps me every single day ‚ù§Ô∏è also, get on a schedule, stop drinking, start eating healthy, and use light therapy in the winter.
3	I ask my INTJ for a big hug :) surround yourself with love!
2	Order your favorite food and pig out. Then draw yourself up a bubble bath while enjoying a wine/joint to help meditate (add music. Duh) When you're done, go on a laid back walk by yourself close to sunset and list all the things that make you smile in your head. Go home. Put on your most comfy pjs and watch a movie that makes you cry your feelings out while nibbling on your favorite snack. Go to bed, sleep on it, and reach out to your closest friend the next AM and get coffee together to talk it out. ‚ô° 
2	Do you have an artistic outlet?
2	In my case - Drugs that help broaden your perspective and thus allow to identify the root issue. They have to figure it out themselves. You can try and do your best to help them, but this sort of thing will become draining and the unicorn will start to seem more like a vampire. It's just my experience tho.
2	Remind them to focus on all the good, positive and uplifting things in their life. There are plenty of good things to go alongside the negatives, although it‚Äôs easy to get swept into a downward spiral. Especially if you‚Äôre a deep thinker/feeler. 
1	Age? Gender? Any piece of background?
1	What's going on?
1	Idk if its healthy but I used Tinder and went on a lot of dates to feel wanted temporarily until I met my current gf through it. I feel a lot better now. Ruined a semester though.
1	best title ever
16	INTJ just out of a 2 year relationship with an ENFP.	I am in my low 40's that was dating a low 30's ENFP.  This was the first time in my life that I have truly fallen in love. Despite our differences, I still see the good in her even though she doesn't.  We dated for about a year before moving her in to my house which lasted all of 5 months before the communication issues (nit-picking and snapping), lack of motivation, unable to finish anything, not able to hold a job, and keep her word just got to be too much and I lost trust after so many disappointments.  \n\nShe was married for 10 years and had 5 kids with her ex husband starting around 18-19 (originally never wanted kids).  They range from 5-12 all with different personalities and their own issues due to a narcissistic father.  She was also sexually abused around 13 by youth church leaders (which she has never openly admitted to anyone but her therapist and myself) and has also been diagnosed with MDD.  She has also admitting knowing the abuse was wrong but also enjoyed the attention at the same time.\n\nWe both still love each other but after her moving out or my house, the situation just got more complicated since she had to move back in with her ultra Christian family.  I was getting less quality time (4 days a month when we were kid free every other weekend).  I am a genuine, giving, tolerant, intelligent, open minded, non controlling, very logical person.  I can honestly say that I have done everything for this woman from spending quality time, trips, adventures, gifts, remodeling, to helping her with her kids, bills, and opened her mind to finding a career path that she would really enjoy. I helped her find her passion and start a business only for her to give up at the first sign of failure.    \n\nI know logically this relationship has become toxic and had to force myself to walk away. This was the hardest thing I have ever had to do.  We had so many deep discussions, similar interests, and just so much fun when we hung out. We were truly best friends and lovers and it all came crashing down because of her irritability and taking everything out of context.  With my personality type, not having the closure of having any definitive answers, is driving my overthinking into overdrive.  I know there are quite a few factors listed here and any one of them could be a trigger of growth but she is stuck in this "my life is a series of unfortunate events" pattern and now has just accepted it.  I do love her and still want to see her succeed but I feel like I have exhausted all efforts on my end only for the blame to be thrown at me. \n\nAt this point just advice, point of view, anything really would help.  I appreciate it in advance. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
4	OP, your situation is so similar to mine that I had to comment.\n\nI‚Äôm an ENFP out of a 1.5 year relationship with an INTJ. We moved in together, and communication issues arose too. Like you, my INTJ did everything he could to help me with my lack of stability in job hunting, feelings of hopelessness... just like your ex, I also felt like my life was stuck in an endless series of unfortunate events. I didn‚Äôt give my INTJ the alone time he needed and in the end, I was too much for him and he moved out. \n\nI was wondering when you started losing trust in your ENFP? I keep wishing things played out differently... that ENFP-INTJ chemistry at the beginning was absolutely magical and unforgettable. \n\n\n
3	Why do you think it was a toxic relationship? Also, did you two try going to couple's therapy? Idk man, it's a story old as time, INTJ falls head over heels for ENFP, then realizes he doesn't have the patience to deal with one. Her lack of stability with jobs is because she's searching for a deeper, more meaningful existence. We have a wide range of interests, and many times we can't know something isn't for us until we've tried it and decided, "this isn't it." That's tough for a xxTJ. You guys like to plan it out before making your move. You guys are generally able to make yourselves OK with a decision as long as it makes sense. If it makes you unhappy, you'll stick it out for the longest time because it makes logical sense in your mind. We don't function that way. Planning things out usually means we make the wrong choices or factor outside influence (like other's opinions) too heavily and end up being unhappy. We're slaves to our Fi. In the words of a few of my teasing, non-ENFP friends, "we're free birbs! And as free birbs, we must be allowed to fly!" They joke, but when I think of my own life, there isn't a truer statement out there. Your ex is her best self when she is allowed to be free without fear of your or anyone else's judgement.\n\nI'm sorry, but being an ENFP generally means life is going to be one long series of unfortunate events. We start out like an infant with eyes and heart wide open, then something beats us down. It sucks, but it just means it wasn't for us. The more resilient ENFPs cry it out however long it takes, then pick up and keep going. However, all ENFPs become pretty resilient compared to the norm because of this. She has a ways to go learning about herself and what makes her happy. That's her lot in life; her cross to bear. It's not that she isn't trying. Trust me, she's the one living the disappointments. She's well aware. It's your decision whether or not to do this journey with her, or go it alone. \n\nYou probably feel disappointed that your manic pixie dream girl wasn't all the good and none of the bad. Unfortunately, everything must have balance and for the ecstatic highs we can easily bring ourselves to, we can easily fall just as low, just as fast. We're not as sunshine and rainbows as people think we are. We have a dark side just as intense as our bright side. I'm not here to judge you, because like others here, I have also been that ENFP who has let an INTJ down. We get it, and we understand. It's burdensome to ride our roller coaster. You have to find your happiness. If it's not with her, then find it with someone else. Perhaps you'll find you like another type better. Perhaps you'll meet another ENFP who is more mature; after all, we're not all exactly the same, but you'll find similar currents running between us. \n\nTo end this with some (perhaps bitter) food for thought, she needs a rock who can weather her storms and love her through it. She needs someone with that kind of temperament, who can handle her. If you can't, be honest with yourself and let her go. It's been almost 4 years since my INTJ and I fell apart. I still think about him every day. I still love him as much as I ever did. I just never see him, never talk to him. It get's better. Hopefully you won't (or will, depending on your perception) end up like me and still love her after many years. I for one have come to appreciate the blessing of at least having met one person with whom the connection we shared was so strong it at times felt like religious ecstacy.\n\nFeel free to keep talking to us, or you can even pm me if you feel like you need to get stuff out and can't do it to anyone but an internet stranger! I'm always happy to listen to people \^-\^
2	I'm kinda too young and don't know if I fully understand the situation but one thing that helps my overthinking is distracting myself for some time. I don't mean not thinking about her at all but more like not trying to understand things or find a solution. Just letting myself be emotional. Like if I feel angry at her and feel like crying I just cry, or if I miss her I daydream about the good times with her. All without trying to solve the situation because sometimes when I try to solve it, my overthinking exhausts me and I become completely useless and spin in circles. A couple of days just being emotional help me relax and think with more clarity. Hope this helps.\n\nP. S. Most probably am an ENxP, although not sure
2	What matters most is that you take care of yourself. A relationship may be good, but it's never worth staying in a toxic relationship. Remember to give yourself a big hug! You're worth it. Time to hang with some buddies, join a Meetup, and get into your hobbies :) Wishing you the best!
1	Sounds like you and her are twin flames. The friction is normal in those relationships. It dissipates eventually. 
1	I want to thank you all for your advice.  I was in a bad place yesterday, but today, I finally got the closure I needed.  Her true colors came out and blatantly manipulated me.  I honestly believe she is an immature female narcissist and it has nothing to do with personality type.  Too many negative/traumatizing factors over her life that made her care only about herself in every instance but kept a great facade for a long time.  Door has been slammed!!!  Her loss, not mine.  It finally made sense to me a few days ago why every single one of my ex's always come back after the break.  It could be a week, 6 months, and even had one from 23 years ago hit me up recently. It is because I am a genuine, giving, and caring person that eventually they try to exploit my weaknesses and think there is better out there.  When they realize what they lost, they come back...ALL OF THEM.  This post may come off as egocentric but that isn't my personality at all.  I am just highly pissed that I didn't see through it earlier. 
7	Do you tend to attract dominant misogynistic/chauvinistic men because of your personality?	 When I am especially ENFP and am acting bubbly, emotional, sensitive, absent-minded, silly, and ditzy... I notice I tend to attract chauvinistic and misogynistic men who want to take care of me and treat me like I am fragile and a damsel in distress. They will patronize me and "mansplain" and try to teach me things. These types of men will look at me with an amusing smile on their face and patronize me when I say/do silly/ditzy things and will call me cute/adorable. They will open the doors for me and want to drive the car. It's like I naturally take on traiditional gender roles and attract men who do as well. Anyone else notice this about some of the men they attract? Also, do you like when this happens to you? I am torn because I want to be cherished in a relationship and love chivalry but I also want to be respected...\n\n&#x200B;
5	I'm in a new relationship, so take what I say with a grain of salt, but I don't think that you can't feel respected in a relationship where a man "takes care of you". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSure, my boyfriend will check my bike light to make sure I'm safe on the road, open doors for me, hold my coat out so I can put it on easier, teach me about his homeland and job, tell me I'm cute... But he also respects my profession, shows a genuine interest in my life and we can have proper conversations about politics, gender roles and media. His muslim upbringing plays a big part in how he treats me and I personally don't think it gets in the way of my feelings for him. If anything, being so respected AND cared for has me falling for him crazy fast. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, if a man doesn't show any interest in you as a person - beyond the cheery happy-go-lucky vibe we carry - it is most certainly time to bounce. People are so profoundly deep and interesting, and if someone isn't willing to look at you that way, they're not worth your time!
5	Gay guy here and this is so accurate for me. I tend to only be attracted to guys like this (hard to find) but also hope they will not be too traditional so much that it bleeds into their political views. Not that I care if they are more conservative , liberal etc or not, it's more people who are a bit ignorant to try new things and expand their mind. This has always been my case with this kind of guy - unwilling and closed off.
3	Proverbial INTx to the rescue? Lol
3	Lol I feel this on a personal level. It honestly breaks my heart when people are shocked that I am actually intelligent and have been successful in my career/schooling because the way I feel most comfortable socializing is through my typical ENFP behavior. I feel like I end a lot of love interests or relationships because as much as I like to have fun and see new things (i.e. honeymoon phase fun), I just want to be understood and my ideas heard, and once the honeymoon wears off and I realize they're just there for the fun, or a pretty face, I bounce.
3	As a straight guy I get the opposite of this from the same guys. My presence roots out their insecurities and when I was in my twenties, hitting up random bars they would: a)try to pick a fight with me or b) try to mock me. \n\nOne of the reasons I hate dive bars now. I avoid any place that has a happy hour. I hate dealing with dullards that thinks the 1950s were great and feel like their masculinity is threatened because I am wearing a purple suit. 
2	I'm unsure if I'm an ENTP or ENFP, but yes it definitely happens to me when I display Ne kind of behaviour. It doesn't help that I have a girl-like face and my body language can be a lot like you described. IME, these people don't see anything but the 'cute' bit in me, like I have no depth whatsoever. I've experienced people who I thought to be good friends turn to be these patronizing jerks and typically, it ends up in me displaying rather reticent behaviour for a short while after that- like a switch turned off. And then those guys ask what the problem is and ITS THEM GODDAMIT. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTl;dr- Yes. Very very relatable
2	This seems like simple cause and effect to me. You act like you can't take care of yourself, you attract people who want to take care of you. \n\nI act all of those things except ditzy, because "stupid" is something I absolutely never want someone to think of me. Maybe it's a difference in perception, or maybe it's the ditzy act, but while I attract men who enjoy a more "traditional" role, I never feel looked down on. If they call me cute, I think it's a wonderful compliment. When they compliment the way I think, however, I feel on top of the world. As an ENFP I definitely seem like a mess who needs help (and let's face it, I could use help lol), but I don't think I've ever met anyone who thought I was helpless, rather, there is something about my not-all-togetherness that brings out their desire to protect. But even so, they usually characterize me as headstrong and dominant. \n\nIf you don't like the men you attract, perhaps you aren't acting exactly the person you are?
10	Reminiscing About the Future at Night	It's 01:55 AM where I live right now, and I'm sitting here at my desk just thinking about my future. Not knowing where it will take me and what kind of memories I'll be able to make. Having around 130-140 tabs open with inspirational stuff, scientific papers or whatever sparks my interest.\n\nI don't know how to describe it, but do you sometimes also feel this need of spending some time for yourself to dream and fantasize about an idealized version of your own future? I especially love to write down my thoughts and just scribble around a lot.
3	Yeah! Every night... Sometimes it makes me worry... Bc I know it's not going to happen as I imagine it. That makes me sad. 
2	Fudge, yeah man. Unfortunately my wife who is with me all the time (and I love it) hates that I stay up, so I sit here feeling guilty about it. I think I'm gonna show her this post.
2	yes, i think doing this is pretty important to me. If I don't think about the future then how can I work to bring that into reality? How can I know what I want to do if I don't think through it? How do people coast through life never dreaming about what could be around the corner? 
2	Although it sounds quite poetic like this you should google reminiscing. \n\nIt's natural for us. On this page is a great sentence  about this specific point.  
1	Yes, very often. As well as dream and fantasize about an utopian version of our current world...Like how better would this world be if each and every one of us actually acted like "human" beings and was kind to one another? Sigh...it pains me that it's not the case. I still manage to see the beauty wherever it is though :) 
2	Same	\nI don't know how many times I have explored people on my online path. My apps have lengthy history logs filled with users met and deleted\n\nMeet up, \n\ntake the time to learn everything(!) about them, \n\nlet it sink in, \n\nrealise that even if everyone is special there isn't really much unique about them,\n\nRelease them\n\n\nThey might be different from a cultural perspective or personality type. Some think they are better, others think they are wierd. Some would say they are special, but to me they are just normal people, they are all the same\n\nNothing new under the sun\n
2	AFAIK from my own experience and some books/reddit post/artciles about ENFPs I think it's pretty normal. We ENFPs like a lot being surrounded by people, socialize, etc... BUT we only keep/elect few of them to be _our real friends_.\nThe point is: once we have explored all the aspects about something/someone, it's pretty easy to get _bored_ and start looking for something else (for the joy of our Ne).\n\nAlso my online/real life is filled of people met and then _abandoned_, but this is a common thing in humans, it just may vary between types, but it's there. How many best friends from your childhood are still your best friends today? I'm 41, my answer to that question is 2 people: 1 met at the preschool, still hanging out with him (when possible) and one met at primary school (not hanging out too much because he lives in another country, but we keep in touch regularly). Same goes for when you were teenager, high school, and so on. If you start keeping the count of them, you'll realize that what you consider real friends are a relatively small number.\n\nLast note: long term online friendships are possible, but not as frequent as you might thing. In my case, of hundreds of people meet online, maybe I only kept 1 or 2 in 20 years.
2	Thinking of my ideal relationship type - exp with ENFJ or INFJ relationships?	So I‚Äôve really been thinking of my ideal relationship type lately (while I would never let that constrain me or limit my freedom to date or marry someone that felt right), I‚Äôm really liking the idea of having a better understanding of this person! In a relationship, some qualities I‚Äôm really searching for between us would be affection, balance (in many many ways), and deep connection and their deep character/persona. \n\n\nI think an ENFJ or possibly INFJ may fit that mold. I am wondering how ENFJ and INFJ romantic relationships work in your life. Or what you value in a relationship and what type you have found that in?? :)
4	Ive had this. And let me tell you, it was something quite magical. There is a magnetism between these two people where every thing will just feel right.  \n\nAs an infj, I‚Äôm still waiting on another enfp to energetically squeeze their way into my life. 
3	Had a magical relationship with an INFJ - he knew me better than anyone I‚Äôd ever met! We would still be together if he didn‚Äôt have so many demons in his closet. \n\nJust be careful not to idealize someone based on their personality type - be open-minded, the right person could be any personality type!
2	ENFJs are great, but romantically not really a great fit for us (that is just a generalization. And can in individual cases be perfect. But you will know that yourself if it is the case).\n\nINFJs are often considered as one of the best or the best match for us. And I usually feel a natural and instinctive attraction to them. 
1	I actually had a terrible time in a relationship with an INFJ. We were both a big mix of feelings, but not in a good way. He wanted to save the world, and that included fixing me. I didn‚Äôt like that, as I didn‚Äôt think I needed fixing. It‚Äôs like the therapist-patient relationship was forced on me. In the end, he then blew up, because it turned out he had been holding in a lot of resentment towards my ‚Äúpatient status‚Äù. In every aspect of our relationship, there was no balance.  He *thought* he understood me, and he gave me no chance at understanding him. However, if he had more effective communication skills and if I wasn‚Äôt annoyed by the ‚Äúsave the world‚Äù business, it could‚Äôve been cool and philosophical. Overall though, I think this pairing is overrated and INTJs are more fun. But that‚Äôs just me!
26	Anyone else directionally challenged?	I struggle with directions and just use my google map app to go anywhere.. I‚Äôm absent minded and often have my mind on something else so it‚Äôs nice to use the app.\n\nI tend to get lost everywhere‚Äî-in buildings, while walking, etc. anyone relate? I think people think I am dumb because of this.. 
11	I usually use a map app when I drive my car. But when I'm just walking, I enjoy the challenge of getting lost and find my way. I think it's a nice excercise ;-)
8	This is called spatial intelligence. It is somewhat correlated with general cognitive ability, but there is no strong implication. So, not stupid. Instead you could have above avarage verbal intelligence for example. 
6	My worst fear is someone asking for directions. It happened the other day and I sent the poor guy to the wrong side of town. 
5	I would definitely rather have a map than simply directions. Also if someone tells me where to go in a building its a miracle if I can confidently remember where to go, usually I can guess mostly right but often will ask for additional help. 
4	I'm good with directions.... That is, when I'm actually paying attention to where I'm going and not on "autopilot" üòá
3	The first 3-4 years I started driving, I got lost EVERYWHERE. But now I know my way around everywhere.
2	Yeah. Don't ask me to remember something or give you directions if the place isn't right down the block
2	When I get directions from most men it's hard ex:  Go North/ Northeast take i73 W.. \n\nBut if I have been somewhere before I can remember where things are forever or if someone tells me to go to the second traffic light and make a right by Wendys etc. then that's easy too. \n\n&#x200B;
2	Yes. I only remember places by landmarks (it‚Äôs 2 blocks from the Shell station; it‚Äôs right next to the library). My husband walks into a huge building with no windows and can always tell you where North is. It makes me want to memorize a map of the US because I‚Äôll definitely die if we have any sort of apocalypse go down. 
1	Omg. Yes. I‚Äôve been living in the same town for over 20 years and still can‚Äôt get the streets right üòÖ I usually ask for landmarks. I hate Waze/Google Maps and need a passenger to direct me specifically on what Waze/GM wants me to do. 
1	I'm very absent minded, but I'm proud to be a living version of Google Maps.\n\nAll I need is to look at a map once and I can just get to the location from memory.\n\nThough, I wish I had this good memory in other aspects. Unfortunately, that's not the case. Lol
1	Stick me in a corn maze or mirror maze and I can get out no problem. My gut just knows where to go. Stick me on a road driving or walking and I have NO idea where to go. I've said this before in a different thread but I think it's because cities/highways have a grid system that has odd rules (certain streets being one way or go two blocks around to get a parking spot). Mazes, forest, and fields don't have this. You just know you need to go "that way" and then you go. 
1	I can‚Äôt find my way out of a wet paper bag. I used to get lost going to a friend‚Äôs house every single time I tried to stop by. Just got turned around and unsure of which way was the correct way to go. Her neighborhood was my own personal Bermuda Triangle.
1	I have pretty good spatial awareness.  I rarely use my gps.  Normally I will look on google maps before I go somewhere an do my best to make it there with out cheating.  I imagine my ability is part dna and part practice.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think its all tied up with my fierce need to be self sufficient. 
1	I'm actually the opposite. My directions have always been pretty great and I easily remember street routes and things like that. :)
297	I know y‚Äôall can relate	
31	I constantly insert, "I'm telling you this for a reason..." into my stories because I'm so aware of doing this... But not enough to stop.
12	‚ÄúPre story prologue for context‚Äù couldn‚Äôt agree more. \n\nThe length I go to telling a story some how gets itself into the prologue as well ;)\n\nAll too exciting !
12	It's scary how accurate this is...everybody from when I was in primary school all the way up until now has said this is how I tell stories
6	Hahaha yes. Please add in "ooooh shiny!" Yakyakyak about shiny stuff. Then "oh crap where was I again?"
3	I'm an INTJ and even I can relate... 
3	I'm sending this to my mom.
3	I know this so well from so many girls ive dated that i dont even have to read it and am already annoyed.
3	Omg. I finally found my people! Lol. I thought I was the only one that did this haha
3	Totally me. Now imagine when you're a teacher... :-]
2	Hahahah my daily struggle 
2	People usually stop listening after the 4th or 3rd step
2	My brother whenever I tell him stories:\n ‚Äúget to the point!‚Äù 
2	I dont know how many times I have been telling a story, then remember something else that I wanted to tell them, then go back to the story.
2	Man, I've been getting so self-conscious about how I tell stories since I saw this chart! Can't help it though: normal is overrated!
1	Yyyyyeeees.
1	LMAO
1	Factual
1	INFP here but sammmeeee
1	Fuuuckkk lol every single time 
1	Hahahaha omg the most accurate post ever! 
1	Me listening: "Uhhhhhh. Please stop talking."
1	"something I just now remembered" is always my favorite moment because that's when I remember the reason behind all of this conversational madness. 
1	Haha apologize. Always! 
1	never related to something SOOO MUCH in my life *wipes tears of gratitude*
1	I feel personally attacked.

7	I don‚Äôt care what you bobos say; this is the quintessential ENFP (Disney) song	
2	[Verse 1]\nI have often dreamed of a far-off place\nWhere a great, warm welcome will be waiting for me\nWhere the crowds will cheer when they see my face\nAnd a voice keeps saying, this is where I'm meant to be\n\n[Chorus]\nI will find my way, I can go the distance\nI'll be there someday, if I can be strong\nI know every mile will be worth my while\nI would go most anywhere to feel like I belong\n\n[Intrumental interlude]\n\n[Chorus]\nI am on my way, I can go the distance\nI don't care how far, somehow I'll be strong\nI know every mile will be worth my while\nI would go most anywhere to find where I belong
2	Is it the ENFP song, or is it the INFJ song?
2	This isn't Disney, but this song is more where I see us (especially in the context of the whole movie).\n\nhttps://youtu.be/IFuFm0m2wj0
1	This was my fave movie as a kid and I love this song so imma agree based on that.
18	Guilty as charged...	&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zduu53xjy4g21.png

3	Yes. Same here, minus the alcohol ...sigh
2	Need to talk to someone	Hi I would like to have a penpal . \nI feel extremely lonely and got nobody to talk to in depth . I want someone with who I could talk regularly about my feelings , life and we would advice and motivate each other and keep track of our self improvement journey . \n\nI am 22 in uni I am interest in classical music ( piano) , tech , innovation,brainstorming, business ideas ,  manga and Philosophy. \nI identify as XNFP . I am not sure I am fully ENFP even tough I tested as that since I am very introvert. \nFeel free to dm me .
3	I heard technology. **Where is it?**
2	It‚Äôs gonna sound like I‚Äôm giving you cold shoulders but, are you in therapy ? It can help a lot even if I know you wish to engage in a less ‚Äú professional‚Äù relationship. 
1	Any specific types you wanna talk to or just other enfps?
1	Pmd!
2	My personality has changed and I am in need of some guidance.	I used to be very much an ENTP, the descriptions fit pretty much perfectly. Lately I have been confused because many of the things I used to like no longer appeal to me, and I have found joy in a lot of things I used to dislike. This has been turning my world upside down and I feel a little lost.\n\nI recently decided to take an MBTI test and found that I am now ENFP. When I read the descriptions of ENFP, I'm finding that the goals and ambitions of ENFP people match up with my own, but my instincts and experience were built by years as an ENTP. This feels like it is the source of my problems; my skills and ambitions are at odds with each other.\n\nYou guys here on /r/enfp are the experts on life as an ENFP, so I'm hoping you could help me out with some questions that might give me some direction and better understanding of myself. FWIW I am a man in my mid 20s.\n\n**questions**\n\n* What do you do for fun when socializing is not really an option? I've had a much easier time identifying what I *don't* like anymore than what I *do*. I've identified a few things (rom-coms, non-fiction books, for example), but when I'm alone and have time to relax I often feel like I don't have enough outlets.\n\n* I feel a newfound need for some kind of meaning or purpose in my life. I very much want to do something to make the world a better place. The problem is I have no idea what. How have you found some kind of meaning in your life? Or alternatively, how do you deal with not having a clear meaning or purpose?\n\n* I'm trying to analyze my career options. I have experience in software engineering, but I used to be driven by the work itself. I feel I need some kind of larger ambition or goal to work towards, or at a minimum some way to get through the day. Hours alone in front of a computer makes me bored out of my mind. As careers are concerned, what kind of things should I be looking for? Should I even be looking for a career, or is it easier and better to just look for things that will keep me busy for a few years at a time?\n\n* What do you do to get the most satisfaction out of your interactions with other people? ENTPs can come off as argumentative and stubborn, and I've certainly softened these traits, but they are still there and it makes my interactions less fulfilling. I enjoy being around people, but I feel I need to get better at it to get more satisfaction out of my interactions. What can I do?
3	So, I'm no expert but I identify as an ENFP, highly sensitive one (HSP), according to tests ( haha). So here are some of my answers to your questions.\nFor fun, I like to let out my creativity : I like to write, draw, paint, dance, play and listen to music, but I also read, solve puzzles (all kinds: word puzzles, logic puzzles, sudokus, jigsaw, enigmas, etc), watch documentaries, learn new skills, do handy jobs, volunteer. And yes, I do find all of these things fun, and I do enjoy doing them alone (or with people) depending on how I feel.\nFinding a meaning to one's life is a lifelong journey in my opinion. I, for myself, have known at an early age that I wanted to leave this Earth a better place and I personally choose to do so on a daily basis in the way I interact with people and care for the environment. I also believe that my career (as a teacher/coach/mentor) has helped me have a little positive influence on people around me. \nAs far as if you should be looking for a career,  only you can really answer that. It'll depend on what type of person you are: do you like things to be easy and go with the flow, or do you prefer challenges that will drag you out of your comfort zone and potentially help you grow as an individual? Also, your career/job won't be the only thing going on in your life nor the only thing defining you. You can also change later on. You have the power to choose and change. Don't forget that. Too many people forget.\nWith regard to how do I get the most satisfaction out of my interactions with people, I rarely do. I love interacting with people, they keep telling me that they really enjoy interacting with me but I often feel that I'm left unsatisfied and, at times, frustrated with my interactions with them: rarely feeling "fulfilled". Except for a chosen few. My suggestion for this would be to surround yourself with people who accept you for who you are and are able to be honest with you. I personally find that I get a little more satisfaction out of my interactions with these types of friends/family members/people.\nHope this helped. Hang in there! \n\n
1	As an ENFP, I can say the thing most important to me when considering my career is being able to reach people, and have them "see what I see," which is pretty much how beautiful life is. A big quality of ENFP is their ability to reach people, almost as a prophet or politician, which I guess is how I feel about travel and people experiencing a new place. If you really made the switch from ENTP to ENFP, I can guarantee you will not be happy at a desk job, unless it really stimulates your interests. We're eager to feel trapped, and once we do it's game over, you won't be happy until change occurs. The way I am when it comes to interactions, I would rather no one get upset, and try to get my point across in maybe a more demure manner, but my words still have impact and meaning, I am just not harsh about it. \n\nI would honestly keep testing as the months go on, because to me this sounds like maybe a temporary rut of sorts, especially since you aren't feeling like you have newfound interests, but you are instead lost. The middle two letters of MBTI (ex. NF and NT), these are considered the traits that stay with you your entire life, so in this case it is unlikely that it's your T transitioning, but perhaps you need to take time to bring yourself back to who you once were. Again, it isn't impossible that you are truly becoming ENFP, but it is worth taking the time to explore all options :). Good luck!!
1	i too have waffled between feeling ENTP or ENFP resonating with me, I think its a result of having a stronger Te than Fi, whereas ENTPs have stronger Ti than Fe. The commonality is that "logic" but obviously Te is different than Ti which is why the ENTP experience is different than my own. \n\nAnyway, I hope I can help. \n\n1. As a baseline when im alone im generally listening to music in some way, unless something on the tv is worth watching. I've recently added a hobby (DJing) and listening to music a lot helps in several ways. but beyond that i have music going while cleaning, cooking, reading, or playing video games. I've also taken up "flow art" and will sometimes dance to the music if it moves me. Lastly, i will run through my schedule over the next week or couple weeks so I don't forget any commitments and I can play in my Ne to imagine the fun im going to have in the near future. \n\n2. Everyone will have their own meaning or purpose that is true to them, it can change, and maybe its simply unidentifiable. "Living" itself is a purpose for life, and one we all share. I don't know what my purpose or meaning is, but I believe that constant improvement and fulfillment are necessary to my being. If anything thats my meaning. If I go to sleep at night knowing that I learned, grew, and enjoyed myself then I believe I'm on the right path. For what its worth psychedelic drug use has helped me grow a lot in this way. \n\n3. For me, personally, I am a bureaucrat which is very anti-ENFP in a sense. You'll never find it on a list of desirable ENFP jobs. However, I believe in the work that I do, as boring as it can be at times. I can turn anything into a game though to make it less boring. But what I enjoy most is that its a consistent job with consistent pay that allows me the freedom of time and money to live a comfortable and enjoyable life where I can indulge in my hobbies and friends without worry. All that I have to give is 40 hours of my time per week. Not a bad tradeoff given how much time at work I spend not actually doing work. Anyway, so thats my path. You can follow whatever feels right for you. If you can find a job that really excites you, go for it. \n\n4. I generally always try to be supportive and helpful in interactions with people. sometimes it becomes argumentative because im trying to figure out what the person needs, it becomes an argument when the person just wants to complain rather than solve anything. But really just listening to people and giving a shit about what they are going through is better than how most people seem to treat others.

3	INFP stuck on an ENFP	Hello there! About a month ago I (INFP) was "broken up" with by an ENFP not too long ago (we weren't really dating but we might as well have been). We were together for about two months. There was nothing wrong with the relationship and we didn't do anything that might hurt the other either. Honestly we got along great! He said he'd never been with someone that truly understood him until we met, and I can say the same about him. We were long distance (a 3 hour drive away), but it was manageable. Things were going really smoothly up to a certain point when his feelings suddenly changed. As in one moment he was all lovey-dovey, and then the next moment made a complete 180. He said he needed to figure out his own life first, and that I deserved better in the meantime. We still had a Snap streak until a few weeks ago when he decided to end it.\n\nI've been handling this better than I normally would, but I'm still having a hard time understanding why he suddenly gave up on us. I know he hasn't had a very good past with love, but I also know ENFPs have a hard time with commitment as well. He says in the meantime he'd still like to be friends and to "give it time". I don't really know what he means by that, but I haven't been able to ask him since he broke things off. I'm also confused because he said that he saw us being together for a long time, and even wanted to ask me out but was afraid it would have been too soon. So I guess my question is, should I give up on him or wait for him to figure his stuff out? I wouldn't mind if we were just friends, but I wanted to see what you guys would want from an ENFP perspective. Sorry this is so long, I have a habit of rambling...
7	I‚Äôm basically the ENFP in your story, albeit probably with a little more experience under my belt. Please take care of yourself and move on. You deserve better. \n\nAlso I strongly advise you cut off all contact for a good while before attempting to be friends. Don‚Äôt make it dramatic or personal, it‚Äôs just going to be better for the both of you to do your own thing for bit.\n\nI know I haven‚Äôt really written out a full-blown dissertation here to convince you, but I do sincerely hope you take the advice. 
5	Pretty much what everyone is saying.  \n\nENFPs look for something deep. \n\nDeeper than the norm of deep.  \n\nHe might have got into something too quickly ... and realized this isn't it ..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI believe it's best to move on. \n\nEven if you wait...it wouldn't be the same. 
4	Like the others said, he's letting you down gently. ENFPs change our minds a lot and passionate emotions often fade quickly. But we care about people and don't like to upset them.\nI hope this helps you to move on, best of luck :)\n\n\n\n
3	Move on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe doesn't feel strongly enough about you, sweetie. I've ALSO been that ENFP. Was dating an INFJ guy that was great to talk to and was enjoying our time together... but I didn't feel that earth-shattering something that I was looking for. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can't convince him it'll work out. And honestly, anything he says around break-up time is suspect. Seriously, take it with a grain of salt as he's trying to spare your feelings because he probably does care about you to some extent.
3	I am an enfp. I would say the enfp is looking for something that is missing with you. Best to move on. Dont give up on ENFPs in general, but I know when I decide I am moving on I am realllllly gonna move on, no questions, no pulling me back in
3	In my teens/twenties the highest duration for a relationship was 3 months. I don‚Äôt know why, but already after the first 2 months I started getting bored and looking for something different ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nThen, I suddenly settled for 18 years with the same person.
2	Give up on him. This isn't related to ENFP not being able to commit. That is usually related to getting bored and wanting novelty. It sounds like something he is uncomfortable with emotionally is happening - like he has feelings for you and someone else, or is having a hard time balancing his life. 
2	I've done something similar. Could be a lot of reasons. For me it was that I didn't see a future with this girl. Sure, I liked her and enjoyed spending time with her, but it's been 2 months since we started seeing each other and I felt like if I kept seeing her at that point than the relationship would start to develop into something more serious. So I thought about it, and the best course of action was to cut it off, because I did not want to string her along with something casual when she clearly wanted to be in a relationship. Also, she was into me more than I was into her, so I thought it would hurt less for her to end it ASAP.\n\nI would be cautious of reaching out again, at least until he has had enough time for his feelings to fade away and for him to have thought through his decision. He probably still likes you, but he also probably thought it would be best for him to stop seeing you.
9	I feel like my own thoughts and feelings are destroying me.	Long time lurker and first time poster here, I could really use some insight and advice from any ENFPs who has been in a similar situation before. Thanks in advance for any replies!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll try to keep it as short as I can... I've never been in a relationship before, never even kissed anyone. Recently I met this guy who I have developed a MASSIVE crush on. Pretty much almost an obsession.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen we're together he's really flirty, sweet and kind to me even though he's one of those emotionally unavailable ones. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I'm alone my mind starts to wander; it's either thinking up our future together and putting him on a piedestal, idealizing the heck out of the whole situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next second my mind switches and begins to think about how he's not really interested in me at all, just interested in sex. (Which is a big deal for me, because virgin.) To be honest, the thought of me giving him "that part" of myself, sleeping with him, and then him leaving once he's gotten what he wants is breaking my heart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI begin to feel insecure and bad about myself and who I am, and the thought of him falling for someone else and forgetting about me is also heart-breaking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe hasn't done anything to provoke these thoughts either, he seems like a good guy, it's all just my own annoying brain farts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI like him incredibly much, but this is tearing me apart so badly I've thought of taking some distance even though I don't want to. I've never felt so intensely about someone, but I'm afraid of getting my heart broken by him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny tips on how I can just CHILL OUT and stop worrying so much? And how would you know someone is truly interested in you, and a relationship, instead of just sex?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI realize asking his intentions would be the best thing to do, but he hates discussing labels, emotions and stuff like that. Maybe we're just incompatible?
9	A relationship without an emotional connection is  built basically on hormones, and hormones are fickle. \n\nI spend too much time in my head too, but actually having a real conversation with him is the best way to settle your thoughts, I'd say. At least you'll have more solid data to pull from when making a decision. Seeing how he reacts could make your decision much easier. That said, I know my heart has had me put off such conversations because it likes holding out hope.\n\nMy only other advice is to not give up long-term happiness and fulfillment for something temporary and fleeting. \n\n
4	I‚Äôm sorry to hear you‚Äôre going through a lot. It sounds like this guy doesn‚Äôt deserve you honestly. I don‚Äôt want to ever tell you what to do, but if I were you I wouldn‚Äôt waste my time on someone who wouldn‚Äôt want to commit to me. Your virginity is something special and should be given to someone who has true feelings back for you, I wish I had done that but I didn‚Äôt and regretted it. You‚Äôre an enfp, you have strong values and morales that you won‚Äôt put aside for anybody. Just remember that when you feel upset. Remember your values and remind yourself of your self worth. Love yourself the way you love others is something that‚Äôs really helped me as I‚Äôve matured and gotten older. Also, idk if you‚Äôre spiritual but praying and meditating on it might help... trust your gut and your intuition but also don‚Äôt overthink. For instance, I believe in God and so when I overthink I just tell myself it really doesn‚Äôt matter everything will work out the way it‚Äôs meant to be and God won‚Äôt give me more than I can‚Äôt handle, and I tell myself I can handle this and with His help I‚Äôll make the best decision for me. Positive thinking and positive self talk like that has always helped me. I also get in emotional ruts with decision making and I just gotta let it go and preoccupy my mind with other things that are healthier for me. Maybe you can try getting your mind off of it by dating other guys and see what else is out there. Because trust me girl there are plenty of other fish in the sea who are emotionally available... you just have to go fishing and be patient until you find your perfect catch :) Idk I hope this helped. I just think that you gotta put your happiness first and if you already sense that this person is not right for you then trust that and move on to someone who has the same values as you and will be just as infatuated by you as you are by him :)
3	Hello, it must be a confusing time for you, as it is for the whole of human race. We easily confuse sex with love. Sexual Attraction with the joy of being with another human being.\n\nYour natural state is relaxed, calm, joy. That is just how we are. Sometimes we get bored, and we look for something to excite us. Your body and instinct wants to experience sex, which is fine. But your emotions are signaling you that you will get hurt if you choose to be with this person. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour doubts are coming from a place that knows what the situation is. It is obvious just from reading this, that this guy is not interested in you. Or else he wouldn't play this game of being reserved, and hiding his emotions. Or perhaps he is just playing you, and your emotional state to his advantage, keeping you at a distance but not too distant. This is what men were taught to do to Women in our western society. And women just play along. There is no one to blame.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn order to differentiate between love and sex. Choose love. Be okay to be alone, but be available to love. Be available for love, but not for sex. Love is simple, you don't doubt love, you don't play emotional games, and you're not reserved, you simply give to the other person, whatever you have to give, and the basic thing you can give, is your being. Your presence, should be enough for the right person. Any other expectation out of you, which makes you not enough, is not love. If your partner demands anything out of you, like sex, then that is not love. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour responsibility is to be the guardian of the gates of love.  Are there any expectations out of you? Then that is demanding something out of you, and it is conditions. Then it's not worth it.  
2	The fact that he is emotionally unavailable and only looking for sex worries me, for you. It may cause you more emotional harm down the line if you have sex with him. Tread carefully, even the strongest crushes fade over time. (I‚Äôm on the same boat, have been crushing obsessively hard on someone)
2	I suffer from unwanted intrusive thoughts- when I got a hold of that side of me, I was able to be clearheaded and emotionally available to those around me.
2	As a supposed ENFP, try to trust your intuition or develop it by understanding what you're going through.\n\nI suggest reading up on some Brene Brown and attachment theory to get some more insight and give you some anchors to ground your thoughts around. Learn how to be vulnerable and express your needs, chances are he is not too comfortable with those things either. Doing this will give you more information and a sense of what to do. If he doesn't want vulnerability or closeless you learned something about him while also learning something about yourself. If he does want vulnerability proceed and have fun. \n\nAlso regarding kissing, science says passion is more important than technique so go with that. \n\nAlso don't overexhaust yourself. Try to get some rest to not drive yourself crazy overthinking the whole situation while denying you're too afraid to act while that is probably what is going on instead of projecting some malicious agenda onto the guy. 
144	Do all of u guys hate authority or is it just me?	Especially when I'm at a job or something and I see any of my superiors I have this voice at the back of my head going "how the heck does he/she have this job? I could do it a million times better "
56	Constantly raging against it. And I‚Äôm willing to quit almost anything on principle. 
50	I get what you mean, I hate when incompetent people aare in positions of authority, but on the other hand, when someone is my superior and they are absolutely amazing at what they do and have earned said authority, I definitely have no problem submitting to them and respecting their authority.
83	I think humans shouldnt have the right to tell other people what to do with their own life and bodies. We are born in a society that forces us to live life a certain way or you will fail.
22	Yep.\nWell, I have a hard time accepting bad authority.\nWhat I do is being very open with that and I start with it whenever I interview for a job.\nThere are bosses out there who appreciate open feedback to their managment and decision making. This way I make sure, that my future boss is one of those people.\nBest run companies appreciate direct (not hurtful, constructive) feedback, imho.
17	I have a strong dislike of authority. I am very friendly person, but the moment someone tells me what I HAVE to/or not do, I immediately want to rebelle.
15	Not all authority,  but when someone is put into a leadership position that doesn‚Äôt have a clue what they‚Äôre  doing?  For damn sure.   Especially when they make it their mission to be ‚Äúright‚Äù for the sake of being right instead of being the most efficient. ‚ÄúBecause I said so‚Äù types drive me UP A WALL.  \n\n
11	Shadow / Subdued Se in the ENFPs and it is weak. Contrasted with Ne and Ni in the ENFPs which is strong.\n\n>ENFPs have the capability and ability to be direct and firm with others in such activities as giving direct commands or making categorical statements about things perceived.\n\n>However, the period of time when this occurs in an ENFP is generally short-lived.\n\n>As soon as the ENFP starts to think about and starts to seriously consider the negative connotations of their directness or firmness (Se), for example, fear of instilling fear in another person in such a way that it would cause the person to be timid to or even scared to approach the ENFP thereby distorting the personal bonds the ENFP has with the person (Fi), the ENFP will back away from making such statements.\n\n>Therefore these direct and categorical statements are quite difficult for an ENFP to make, even if the ENFP understands the benefits of being direct or firm with others, such as the benefits of being firm or direct with children in parenthood.\n\n>&nbsp;\n\n>If an ENFP is directly challenged or if an ENFP observes a task a person demonstrates that is subsequently performed by the ENFP or a group that the ENFP is in (such as a teacher showing a classroom how to put together a widget, and the classroom then is instructed to put together their own widget), the ENFP will consciously want to show their propensity and ability in performing the task as good as, if not better or faster than the original person or at least better than the group that the ENFP is in.\n\n>Anything less is considered a failure. ENFPs will want to show proficiency in any task that is given to them, even if novice failure is understood.\n\n>This, again is to demonstrate visibly to others that "I can do it" or "I can do this satisfactorily".\n\n>Failing at accomplishing this and then subsequently being shown how to do the task is embarrassing for the ENFP since they feel like they "should" have been able to accomplish the task if they were shown how to do the task at least once.\n\n>&nbsp;\n\n>ENFPs will struggle with things that require sustained willpower and self-motivation.\n\n>Because of fluctuating interest levels in self-pursuits, these tasks are difficult to sustain.\n\n>These tasks include (but are not limited to) staying motivated to keep a workout regimen, sticking with a diet, sticking to a routine of doing a particular errand at the same time periodically, and other similar tasks.\n\n>If the willpower is not there, it cannot be artificially manufactured to get the ENFP to "push through".\n\n>Concordantly, attempts by other people to get the ENFP to "push through" is met with resistance.\n\n>Though, it may be that the ENFP will heed the call begrudgingly, this is not sustainable; the ENFP will find a way out if this external push persists.\n\nI have thoughts, but I rather hear your thoughts than share my own.  üòä\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Come at me***, \n\n\n\n(‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢)\n\n( ‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢)\n\n( ‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢)>‚åê‚ñ†-‚ñ†\n\n(‚åê‚ñ†_‚ñ†)\n\n*share me your thoughts!*\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9mQTmXxU8E
20	I'm not the type to scream "Fuck Cops" or actively wish they would all die; I'm not an edgy kid. I know that they play a role in society but I really don't ever feel comfortable around them. 
8	I accept authority in appropriate situations. Like my boss or my teacher, as long as it‚Äôs fair.\n\nAs soon as authority shows bias or unfairness I lose all respect. Which is why my view on the police force can be mixed sometimes.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt have structural authority over me? Nah screw you. On my own time I listen to no one but myself. 
5	I have absolutely no problem with authority if I feel appreciated and respected, and when I, in turn, respect the authority figure. If the authority figure is an idiot who has no idea how to do their job we have a real problem. \n\nAlternately, I do not like roles where I am an authority figure even though I‚Äôm a natural leader because I feel like everyone should have equal respect for the work that they do. 
4	As someone who is an authoritative figure to the 150 students I teach, I‚Äôd say that authority is not the problem. It‚Äôs when the authority is corrupt. I cannot stand assholes in positions of power. I am here for my students. They are always my top priority. 
3	Yes, kind of. I just don't like being commanded what to do. I am now self employed because having a job is no fun! Too much micro-managing bs. 
3	i've worked myself into a high position in my career by being able to deal with authoritative a**holes - yes it hurts.  a lot.  yes i have suffered greatly.  for a while i was on meds and in therapy, etc.  but now i am the boss.   \n\nthere is the old saying about success being like pregnancy - everybody congratulates you once you have achieved it, but nobody wants to hear about how many times you had to get screwed. \n\nhomeless shelters, mental hospitals, and prisons are full of people who really cannot deal with authority.  some people really just cant.  and i dont blame them.\n
3	HAHA, I have that same thoughts with the current authorities at my job. It's a flippin shit-show right now. But I agree with some of the other commenters here, I don't have a problem with all authorities, just bad authorities. I think it's interesting that my other co-workers seem oblivious to how terrible things are in this office. I would think I'm crazy but I was able to talk to a few people who don't work here anymore and found out they left for the same reasons why I hate it here. I hope, for the both of us, that we will find jobs that we love! HANG IN THERE! :D
2	Ohh yes I'm such a rebel (at least internally, sometimes openly) when people try to tell me what to do. It infuriates me, even if it is fairly reasonable. Plus I have all this major anxiety of trying to do things perfectly and being criticized for not doing it right or too slow.
2	Depends on the authority. We can‚Äôt all be the boss. When someone tells me I can‚Äôt get a tattoo, that really grinds my gears, but when someone is telling me they need ‚Äúthis report‚Äù turned in by ‚Äúthis time‚Äù it‚Äôs more acceptable. Also, the type of boss matters, there‚Äôs the ‚Äútaskmaster‚Äù and then there‚Äôs the ‚Äúleader‚Äù the leader pulls the load with their workers, where a taskmaster yells at their workers while sipping soda in a comfy chair.
2	I definitely have an authority issue lol. I get really uncomfortable around authority.
2	I really just hate being told what to do in general. I don't get along with a lot of J-types bc I get really fed up with being commanded or feeling like my freedom is restricted. It's even worse at work with an incompetent boss. I honestly don't even listen to what they tell me to do most of the time, I just kind of smile, nod, and quietly rebel. 
2	I was actually ranting about this 5 minutes ago to my boyfriend... glad I'm not alone. How does the world function when we have such incompetent idiots running it?\n\nI work in a corporate environment and am so close to quitting it all and abandoning society as a whole. All of the greed, the inefficiencies, the counterproductive monetary goals that hinder what could be actual societal progress, the herd mentality, the ignorance, the lack of curiosity... it's all absolute garbage.\n\nI hate it, I hate it all.\n\nThe fact that someone's "position" determines the value of their decisions is an archaic, hierarchical system that only leads to manipulation and favoritism to climb the ladder. Resumes are elaborated to the point of nonsense, padded with extraneous details that make someone sound like a pseudo-intellectual, whereas all they did in their previous job is copy and paste from Excel while using a few index matches here and there. Deadlines are dictated by authority figures who have no regard for the employees that are required to meet them, or the work it entails to get their ridiculous requests done. We're treated like robots, not humans, with no room for empathy or cooperation when the money is on the line because society has chosen to value greed over the well-being of its own constituents'.\n\nI will admit that some companies and figures of authority can manage their employees in a humane and relatable way, but most take the slightest human err as a malfunction and throw you to the landfill once you expose you're a human being with emotions. The worst part is that at the end of the day, you need them more than they need you and that's enough for any kind of psychological abuse to be justified in this dog-eat-dog world.\n\nIt's a real shame to see what society has become.
2	i respect authority when my superior earns it. but if he/she is an incompetent swine who treats people like trash, i have no problem rebelling for the sake of pissing them off. 
2	No because I don't want their job.  I want them to do really well so my job goes smoothly and I can do it and get paid and go home. 
1	I‚Äôm a bit indifferent to authority ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nIt‚Äôs great when they do their job and I hate when they abuse their power knowingly\n\nOtherwise, keep doing you, people in authority positions
1	VERY much so
1	in the moment probably yes but when i think about it more i come to accept it if it's not too bad 
1	Sometimes jobs are just stepping stones, so learn what you can and know that it's temporary 
1	The number one principle I base my life on. Question authority. Question people, question the earth, question the very laws of the universe.
1	No. I think it's just a part of living in organized society. It's what allows things to function properly. But I do have a problem with tyranny.
1	I dont like people that abuse their power. I dont mind authorities or someone in charge just dont like douchebags being in charge and using their power to mask their small dicks
1	I‚Äôve been in the Air Force since I was 18, so apparently I can‚Äôt hate it that much. That said, after 20+ years of doing it, I really don‚Äôt identify with my career like I did when I joined and I‚Äôm currently looking at leaving and starting a ‚Äútraditional ENFP‚Äù career...
1	Yep absolutely hate it!!!
1	Nah... lol I mean I respect authority figures as they are in the position(s) they are in, but I also understand they‚Äôre just regular people. 
1	Authority is a bullshit social construct. An excuse for people to not have to think
1	Rage against the man for life 
1	I hate it too, especially if there‚Äôs no reason for someone to be in that position or tell me what to do, aghhh the struggles of an ENFP
1	I don‚Äôt hate authority I hate bad leadership and micromanaging. It‚Äôs the worst!
1	It's a broad question. It sounds more like you dislike someone with 'undeserved' power over you, not necessarily physically, but in a sense that choosing not to comply puts you at some kind of disadvantage - where you feel it shouldn't.\n\nDisliking "authority" as a generalisation seems to be a young-person thing, to me at least. I have learned to appreciate it much more than I would have done ten years ago. Authority is almost exclusively something that can be reasoned with - or at least, this is how it should be. This is a blessing that is unfortunately not afforded to all cultures across the world, an extreme example: North Korea. I also appreciate that sometimes, someone in a position of authority needs to act a certain way that can appear oppressive, out of necessity.                                               \n\nEveryone has had an unreasonable boss. This might be the image you are associating with authority, referring back to my first paragraph - someone who won't listen to reason. \n\nLikewise, some people have experienced incivility with police officers. Speaking with experience from the police-side of the transaction, and having been trained in flow-chart style thinking, sometimes it is necessary to crack the whip for an early lead. This can sometimes be unexpected and appears unreasonable.\n\n**Also, just because someone told you what to do - don't presume they're a J!** \n\n&#x200B;
1	Lol yeah I totally get it. My boss makes snide comments to me and I‚Äôm just thinking ‚Äúbitch......first of all....‚Äù 
1	Dude that sucks! I‚Äôve had jobs like that and I seriously would get migraines everyday. Now I love my job and have creative freedom but prior to that it was rough!
1	Content creation for a non profit. 
1	All of my life. As far back as I can remember. I used to get in full blown arguments with teachers starting in kindergarten. Wasn't my fault they didn't know what the hell they were doing. Haha 
1	INFP here and i'm angsty AF. Can't stand authority and being told what to do. It represses my free-spirited personality
1	I hate that I hate authority. 
1	Lolol I‚Äôm a content creator for a non profit. 
1	Sorry instead of replying on the thread I was replying to you! üòÖ
1	I fucking love Rage Against the Machine - Killing in the Name of
1	It depends on the authority figure. So in general, I wouldn't say I hate authority- it just depends on if they're competent & morally sound. An idiot boss doesn't aggravate me as much as an idiot boss who's also morally bankrupt; unfortunately, I've found most idiots who make it into a supervisory role are the latter rather than the former. 
1	Help with approaching this ENFP.	I posted a slightly similar post before and got many responses that I'm thankful for but they aren't helping much because of my lack of context so I thought I make everything clear with this post. While trying to avoid unnecessairy details.\n\nLast year, I ended up having this stimulating conversation with this very smart ( and hot ) ENFP girl for one night using my INFP best bud's instagram without her knowing that I'm not him. I didn't do anything about it after that night because I had other things that I was trying to focus on ( mainly getting into a good college ).\n\nAnyway, recently we followed each other on instagram and I'm trying to reconnect with her. As I mentioned before, she is hot therefore very popular and get approached by boys frequently. I don't know whether I should wait for her to post a story about something that I could reply to or some shit to start a conversation. I want to make a good first impression in order for the conversation to start smoothly and get deep exponentially because otherwise it's boring and I won't bother even though she has potentiel to be a good chatting mate.\n\nTo make few things clear:\n\n1/ We don't meet IRL that much right now because I'm in college she is still in highschool.\n\n2/ My INFP bud ( who I love very much ) is a borderline retarded I don't want to involve him in this. He is casual friends with her but I don't want his help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** Don't be a fucking prick, read it.
3	She's in high school, you are in college. By this alone you are a trophy boyfriend in her eyes and eyes of her friends pretty much. If you are good looking and outgoing then I don't know what the problem is. Just ask her out, 90% chance she'll say yes if you have some experience in doing it.
1	>	...borderline retarded...TL;DR: Don't be a fucking prick, read it.\n\nLol maybe you should go ask the ENTPs instead then. Just ask her out to coffee or something. 
1	I think you should just text her and say hi! Speaking as a ENFP-girl who gets bored very easily I think you should just text her and tell her that she‚Äôs cute or something!!! It‚Äôs very innocent, go with your instinct lol 
21	Enfp males, few questions about your role in a relationship.	1. How "hard" was it for you to meet your SO?\n2. How did you meet them?\n3. Do you feel free to express yourself, or wearing a mask when SO is present?\n4. What type of characteristics are you proud of in yourself?\n5. What were You looking for in a SO?
15	My SO is ISTJ believe it or not.\n\n1. Wasnt hard to meet. Timing was perfect on both sides.\n2. We both joined a social group to meet new people. We met and left the group.\n3. I've learned to not hide or change anything about myself from anyone. I am open and myself with my SO.\n4. I always make her smile and bring out the best in people. She really likes that.\n5. I was looking for someone who had strengths where I had weaknesses. Tbh, my SO doesnt talk that much. I work all day and talk to people and would be drained if I had to come home and continue the banter. My home is my introvert hide out. My SO is also very organized and methodical, which helps keep me grounded.\n\nI think the combo is a great one. 
5	1. Difficult to avoid the FriendZone. "Why can't I meet a guy just like yoooooou?" If I got to a date though I usually did fine (now married).\n2. We had mutual friends so we'd always sort of known each other, but didn't really hit it off until a group activity.\n3. TBH, I got rid of the "mask" sometime in my early teens. It has never been an issue in my relationships.\n4. Authenticity, empathy, and an ass that won't quit.\n5. At the time we got together, I was looking for my opposite, because my notion was that I didn't need someone who duplicated my strengths and weaknesses. As I've matured in adulthood I'm more fully rounded and don't really "need" anyone to offset my weaknesses, but it made total sense in my youth.
23	Pretty sure she's going to be one of us when she grows up	
6	It really is amazing seeing someone in midst of a existential crises with a unicorn painted on their face.\n\nI once saw a child crying while eating a ice cream cone. I found it very sureal. There are certain things that you can't be sad while doing, like blowing bubbles while crying.  
48	My INTJ friend said something really sweet this Saturday	We were drinking and hanging out. I got on one of my crazy-ass rants about life and the universe and the mission of every human being etc. \n\nThere was an acquaintance there who had never heard me rant in this way and I think it had a profound effect on him (I mean he said as much to us).\n\nAfterward my INTJ friend turned to me and said, "I saw what happened there, how captivated and inspired he was. But people don't realize this is the way you are all the time. It's not a one-off. Even the way you present yourself on social media...it's all the same person everywhere. I know, because I know you. But I don't think other people know that."\n\nIt really fucked me up. It's weird how it's not a surprise to me, because at many points in my life I made truth and authenticity a deeply held value. I've put so much work to align my actions and thoughts in that way. And I act so outwardly confident all the time. But it did surprise me, and take me back. Because I don't think we trust that others can possibly see us the way we see ourselves. Which is why despite how vulnerable I am on the surface there's still this part I don't think ANYONE will get. And being misunderstood is probably the worst pain for me.\n\nBut hearing it said by another person is just that external validation we need so much by the people we care about, even if it doesn't seem like we need it. 
14	I enjoyed reading this
3	Me and my ENFP friend had a similar conversation once! Nobody is ever going to understand us completely and I that makes us feel lonely, especially ENFPs, but at least there are people that get close enough... :)
3	Love this. That's a great bud you got there. We all need that someone that will take their time to "get" you.
2	Beautiful! I'm happy that someone sees you for who you really are ‚ù§Ô∏è
1	this really hit me. I've been dealing with the same thing lately and most of the stuff on this page I relate to but this is pretty spot on. thanks for posting, made me feel a lot better 
1	I still spend a lot of time thinking about this. I mean, very often I had the perception that people listening at me was, as you said, _captivated and inspired_ by me. It also happens that casual people I've met/spoken only once (eg: at a party of some shared friend) when sees me again is incredibly _happy_. Even when I went to a psychologyst, I had to stop for lack of money, she offered to talk to me for free because "you're the most incredible patient I've ever met, it's a joy to talk with you".\n\nHowever, inside me I still find it hard to believe to what I continue to label as "a perception, maybe it's just me misinterpreting".\n\nAs final note, reading your post reminded me that my INTJ friend told me a similar thing some time ago, but I gave it the same label.\n\nThank you for sharing :-)
1	Wonderful! That is such a nice comment by them, to point out something so intrinsic to who you are and making sure you know it. Cheers!
1	I am a strong believer in the fact that a lot of times ENFP's just want to be UNDERSTOOD. Yes, we are confident outwardly, but there is a sensitive little pudge-ball inside all of us. We have a million thoughts, plans and ideas, and we can't get enough. I feel like I can FEEL the way you felt by just reading this. Being understood as more than just "bubbly" or "confident" is a lovely feeling :)
1	When an INTJ gives you a compliment, you should know that you‚Äôre on to something.  
5	It's Too Excited Tuesday!	\nCAN I GET A HELL YEAH?! It's Too Excited Tuesday! Unleash the happy!\n\nWhat makes you excited? :D\n
4	After a few years of waiting for the right time and having the money, I‚Äôm finally getting a puppy today! I haven‚Äôt been able to shut up about it or stop ‚Äònesting‚Äô, lol. I haven‚Äôt had an actual puppy ever since I was seven, that makes it about twenty years, so I‚Äôm beyond excited! \n\n
2	My husband and I are taking a 16-hour road trip this weekend with our dog. We‚Äôll be in our final destination for 12 hours but really want to get away and see something new. I AM SO EXCITED! 
6	ON FREAKING OUT (Made it for myself. I thought maybe other ENFP's needed it too. Hope it helps)	&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/qy2qoa8c72g21.jpg
3	Currently mid-freak out. I think I love you.
2	This is awesome. I do get locked up over imaginary consequences, I just used it to push myself through deciding to have a difficult conversation.
1	I'm glad it helped you out!! It's ridiculous how often I get hung up on simple problems because I make such a fuss about it. 
2	My friend thinks I‚Äôm an INFP but I show more extraverted actions	Hello üëã\nI‚Äôm a 15.5 years young INFP (maybe)\nAnd I‚Äôm here to check if it‚Äôs true.\nI wanted to ask what ENFPs are like and ask you to ask me questions that can help you help me identify what am I.\n(English isn‚Äôt my native language and I know this is going to tern out funny)\nSo thank you all\nAnd I hope you had a good laugh \n
3	Do you enjoy your alone time more than being around friends/loved ones? All my infp friends could go days just being by themselves and they‚Äôre happy. Me (enfp) not so much lol
3	Hmmm. That sounds more like infp. Do you make impulsive decisions or are you more careful with your decision making lol, my infp friends are always telling me to slow down. I admire how my infp friends are less impulsive than I am, I‚Äôve gotten myself into trouble a lot by doing things too hastily. I feel like you guys gotta process more before making decisions or before making plans for your future. Whereas, enfps have a lot of energy and are quicker to change things up I‚Äôve noticed 
2	- Do you have high standards and not give yourself enough credit? (INFP)\n- If someone tested your reputation publically in a physical altercation, would you rise up to the situation and fight? (INFP) \n*At least with my friend*\n- Do you find it hard to express your feelings verbally but feel like you can write it out much easier? (INFP)\n- Are you, for lack of a better term... Awkward around new people? (INFP)\n\n- Do you, for a lack of a better term lmao, talk sort of fast and have wondering thoughts sometimes during conversations? (ENFP)\n- If you were about to publicly get into a physical conflict, would you defuse the situation as much as possible until the last minute? (ENFP)\n- Are you super happy most of the time and with friends, but alone sometimes your mind goes in a downward spiral? (ENFP)\n\nI'm an ENFP now but I can 100% say that when I was younger I was actually VERY shy. Now I can charm even the weirdest of strangers. \n\nYou will eventually grow up and have a better understanding of yourself and how to deal with the world around you üëç
1	INFP is not the introverted version of ENFP. We have different function order and thing differently. You don't have to be extroverted to be ENFP. I have no friends and spend pretty much all my time at home for example. But I'm ENFP because I lead with Extroverted Intuition as my dominant function. The E and I in types just says whether your dominant function is extroverted or introverted. And to Jung that just meant it was either directed outward and wide (extroverted) or inward and deep (introverted).\n\nThe biggest difference I've found when talking with an INFP is we ENFP's use Extroverted Intuition freely, then filter through our values of Introverted Feeling. They judge first with Fi then expand a bit with Ne.\n\nINFP's need everything to relate to them or their values personally for them to be interested in it or find it important. I tried to play a creativity exercise with him where you imagine a spoon and think up others things you can use it for besides eating. He couldn't really do it while for me it is easy and I could go all day basically thinking new things. So I framed it like he was on a deserted island and only had a spoon, what could he use it for to survive and he was able to think up things.
5	What jobs do ENFPs love?	I saw this on r/ESFP and thought it was a great question, so I wanted to ask it here. I'm not enjoying my job either at the moment and looking for ideas. What are some of the jobs that you ENFPs out there have and absolutely love? I'm currently a writer, used to be a journalist and am thinking of switching into UX design. 
7	Freedom and authenticity
2	Musicians, Artists, Graphic Designers etc.
1	UX design would be interesting.\n\nI am currently into analytics and data for my masters. \n\nI've always liked to teach and have done a lot of tutoring...\n\nI tutor part time right now.\n\n&#x200B;
1	I‚Äôm a barista and really enjoy it. I‚Äôm going to school to be an elementary teacher and am so ready to be in the classroom, teaching and being taught by young minds! 
12	This is a video I (INFP) worked on with my friend (ENFP), and we're super proud of it. It's probably our most polished work yet. Our sense of humor can very abstract and philosophical and we thought some other NFs might enjoy it! :)	
2	Did the script make you post this?
1	Good editing!
1	Great job guys!
4	2 things...	I've seen a few times that apparently enfps have two "selves". One that that they are " true to" meaning they are perceived as "kinda crazy" because they don't seem to hide their thoughts or feelings which leads everyone to believe the enfp is really close to them. But then there's another that they don't show. Is there some thing that would show that someone is really special to an enfp? Someone that does get to know the 2nd one?\n\nAnd also, when an enfp seems to become "stone-faced" or quiet and unemotional, is this a really bad thing? The enfp I know, or rather the person I know who is an ENFP (I don't know them personally) does this more and more lately. I'm someone who nearly always keeps my feelings hidden unless I'm very comfortable with those I'm around - so to me this is something I understand to be kind of a comfort for me. But even so, seeing this from them really grabs my attention every time and leaves me wondering.
6	The biggest difference between the general populous that I love and the people I actually feel close to is that I only share inward feelings with those I feel close to. I will word vomit my opinions about anything and everything around me all day, but if I share my introspective thoughts, THAT is a huge sign that I feel close to someone. That and I will want to spend all my time with those people.\n\nAnd it is not necessary a terrible thing if I get quiet and unemotional, but generally I get that way when I feel my enthusiasm will not be/has not been received well. Sometimes I'm just lost in my head though too... but usually when I'm dwelling on something I find dissatisfying. So not a great sign... but not necessary terrible.\n\n
7	Does anyone know how to develop our inferior Si function?	I need balance and my Ne is bugging out üòÇ any tips? On how to be a healthy well rounded ENFP???
2	You develop your Si by becoming more aware of Si both in the moment you need to be more aware of Si but you learn to respect your Si for your Si is a balancer for your Ne but also Si helps you do Ne better.  The right mixture of Si and Ne is often more productive and less draining than a mixture of Ne with very little Si or a mixture where an ENFP goes super heavy in Si and low on Ne (such as during stress.)\n\nYeah easier said than done says a person who struggles with my own Se / Inferior issues üòÇ
1	You get unto Si Fi loop and only do what worked in the last. Which sucks
2	ENFP Male, toxic habits with unavailable women.	I'm writing this less than an hour after being rejected by a coworker I was certain had feelings for me.\n\nRead about the details here: https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/a7tguh/in_love_with_intp_woman_help/\n\nI feel disoriented and stupid. I was caught in this fantasy that the quiet, intelligent, beautiful young woman had the same romantic feelings as me.\n\nShe told me today she never saw me as more than a friend. I couldn't believe it, I kept asking her if she was positively sure, and she said yes. I've been rejected before, but I've never been this surprised by the answer.\n\nThis happens to me a lot, though. I always end up falling for women who are emotionally unavailable, and who don't show explicit romantic interest in me. I THINK the reason is because I am addicted to the *idea* of them liking me, rather than them *truly* liking me outright.\n\nGuys, this issue is really causing me a lot of anxiety. I have deep fears that I will never be satisfied with a woman who purely and genuinely accepts my feelings and reciprocates them. I feel like a broken person. I know rejection happens, and I know it's not a perfect world where everyone you like reciprocates your feelings. But I know my habits, and I know how quickly my feelings change when a perfectly amazing woman becomes uninteresting as soon as she becomes emotionally available to me. Also, I consider myself a very intuitive person, so to be totally off-base on the reality of the situation is making me feel insecure about my reality.\n\nTL;DR I guess my question is a two parter: **1. What can I do about this maladaptive idealization of women I am romantically interested in and 2. Have any other male ENFPs totally misread the signals of their romantic interest, to the point that you question your intuition?** \n\nI'm already worried that this makes no sense, so please ask me if you don't understand something I said. I would gladly accept any clarifying questions. Thank you deeply for your time.
5	The thing that stops me from being rejected, is my **obliviousness**. \n\nI cast away all thoughts of someone being interested in me, because I don‚Äôt want to make the mistake of thinking someone is interested in me and then being rejected causing an anxious awkward spiral out. \n\n\nI‚Äôve also been telling myself lately, **don‚Äôt think about what could be think about what is**. \n\nThinking about what could can really trip you up if you aren‚Äôt living in the moment and accepting the current situation. \n\nAnd yes, your mind might wander, but you have to keep a tight leash on it and pay attention and be conscious of when this happens. \n\n\nYou must have self control over your thoughts and not allow them to control you. \n\n
3	We, ENFPs... are natural charmers... \n\nWe like to be liked everyone. \n\nI have a lot of female friends... however we like each other as friends only (very platonic)\n\nWhen it comes to digging deeper... into romance...into a significant other, you have to learn to discern their actions. \n\nHow are their actions different from the usual interactions I have with others? Does she treat you differently from her other male friends? \n\nI believe this is a good starting point to look at things practically because ENFPs often put people on the pedestal (happens to me all the time...especially with crush on this ISTJ girl for half a year...which I've finally brought myself to stop idolizing lol)... \n\nSo if she likes you more as a friend, her actions should show it... she will treat you differently... 
2	I have definitely been caught up in the idea of someone liking me to the point that I misread signals.\n\nThat said, I also had someone who said she didn't want to be more than friends but later told me that she actually had stronger feelings for me the whole time but didn't think we were supposed to be together, so she didn't tell me the whole truth. That was a beautiful mess.\n\nI have seriously overwhelming moments where I feel like I'll never find a person that I have feelings for that will reciprocate, but I have had enough experiences in my life where I had to wait longer than I expected for things. The important things though have always been worth the wait. \n\nThats the thought that helps me most: when I find the right person, all the waiting and craziness and loneliness will have been more than worth it... and until then I can work on becoming better myself and preparing to be a quality husband. 
10	Do you ever purposely put yourself in emotionally difficult situations?	Just to see how you'll handle them? Or because you're bored?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I've been doing this lately and wondering if anyone else experiences this lol
11	all the time. I see them like obstacles to ‚Äúlevel up‚Äù in life lol
8	Oh yes, always looking for a story. It‚Äôs a blessing and a curse!
5	I dont think of it that way, but its a thing i do unintentionally. I like to experience new and exciting things, and thats going to mean stepping outside of my comfort zone. 
2	I realize that I‚Äôve been doing this more recently. I‚Äôve been being a better friend recently but it‚Äôs more so because I saw a chance to work on my emotional support skills. I‚Äôm also going out of my way to flirt with a girl that I know is crazy as fuck... because I want to see if I can handle it. I view it as helping myself grow as a person.\n\nIt seems selfless from an outside perspective but I can‚Äôt help but feel like a trash person for having ulterior motives 
1	All the time. I value the things you can learn from difficult emotional experiences.
1	Haha sometimes or I just find myself in them/ take on difficult challenges. What‚Äôs an example of a situation/s you put yourself in?
1	Yes, if I think it can make me more experienced or broaden my perspective or in some way get me closer to getting something I want.
1	examples?
6	These songs are heckin' jams!!! Early 2000s rules	
1	Heckin.... Utah, right?
1	The best.
3	How can I stop losing everything?	As ENFPs we have demon si which leads to organization in real life being a huge weakness. I feel this very strongly as in the past few weeks I've lost several debit cards and today I lost my car keys. I lose my glasses several times a week, and I keep forgetting important dates like test days. I can't do structure and it's making me really fucking hate myself. Please help me.
3	This took me forever to tame!! But I am really clean and organized. I used to loose stuff constantly. I started by organizing and giving everything a ‚Äúhome‚Äù once I knew it‚Äôs home, I would imagine it being sad if not there. I know it‚Äôs crazy but I kinda had to care about it or it would never change. So I had to give my scissors imaginary feelings lol. It worked.  
2	There are devices you can get to put on important things so if you lose them you can find them. But try having certain spots for certain things. Do you have a key hook or bowl by your door? Put your keys and wallet there when you come home and you'll always know where they are.\n\nAs for dates there are apps and things to set up reminders so they'll remind you the day before, day of, etc.
2	I like to organize my stuff as "organized chaos", organized enough to know where to look but chaotic enough to not waste extra effort sorting.\n\nStart with one space (say my kitchen or bedroom or wherever I spend a lot of ME time). One small part of it is empty. Everything to be sorted will go there, everything previously there is thrown to a corner. Like things (start big like "school/work" or "going out" items) have their own pile. Continue for all piles, thus reducing the overall occupied space. Then expand a specific pile ("going out" is split into easy-to-access locations like keys and wallet are always in the same spot in your room or by the front door). Then sort the pile into an area where it makes the most sence (books by the bookshelf, etc.). Then continue until the specific section is finished.\n\nYou can make the task more interesting by zoning out to music, or a familiar background. The same could be done electronically (email folders, bookmarked pages on web browsers, etc.).\n\nNOTE: I found keeping my keys together on a \ncarabiner works wonders, just clip it to your pants or backpack wherever you go.\n\nYours in kind,\nINTJ / Mewtwo
1	I have to put things in the same place every single time or I‚Äôll lose them.\n\nEdit‚Äî I wanted to add that I have to write things down in order to remember them. I have my work, school, and personal calendars synced. As soon as something pops up (drinks with a friend, test, doctor‚Äôs appointment), I add it to my calendar with the appointment name, time, and location. Then I make a reminder in my phone for 30 minutes in advance so that I have time to commute if I‚Äôve forgotten. I also have a paper calendar (super cute one that I got on sale at Paper Source) that I hang on my fridge, and every week, I write down my appointments there. The repetition really helps! 
4	ENFP outsider and not fitting in.	Hello fellow ENFPs! I‚Äôm fairly certain that I‚Äôm an ENFP because I‚Äôve tested several times online and I know how the function stack works and ENFP is pretty accurate to my values etc. I‚Äôm also a 4w3 on the enneagram. \n\nSo a lot of descriptions about us say that we can get along with everyone and have a large network of people but I don‚Äôt always feel that way. For example, I‚Äôm a university student and I joined a sorority, but dropped it. I tried to fit into the mold of the perfect girl- but always felt like I never fit in. I hated the superficiality of said ‚Äòsocial cliques‚Äô and the exclusivity and elitism. I also hated that people had to deem you popular to even think of you as likable. Don‚Äôt even get me started on the rules they had for us- a $100 fine for smoking, service hours, and mandatory events. It was so binding and I hated that we had to follow rules. The only reason I stayed was because the philanthropy was children‚Äôs cancer- but we never got to even see where our money was going even though we raised money for the cause. I ended up dropping because I hated the lack of authenticity and kindness.\n\nAlso, I‚Äôve grown up in a largely conservative household and went to public school and now a conservative college and I feel like I don‚Äôt fit in here. My university doesn‚Äôt have a creative environment which is where I thrive the most. Now, I have a small circle of friends that I can be myself around and trust. But it‚Äôs maybe 5-6 people total. I don‚Äôt have that large network of people that everyone says that we have. I know how to make a conversation and be friendly- but that‚Äôs just surface level and I think ENFPs crave a deeper connection than that.\n\nWhat are your thoughts other ENFPs? Ever felt like an outsider even though we aren‚Äôt typed as that? 
4	In some way i always end up feeling outsider. I tend see myself as a weirdo, but then in some aspects i can be too "normal" for the weirdos. It is easy to connect people on few levels, but hard to connect fully or even almost fully.
4	YES \nEvery damn day. \nI work in a large office environment and I feel ostracised and as though i'm avoided most of the time. \nI'm paranoid that I'll talk to much, or say the wrong thing, it's easy for me as I speak before I think.\nI get social anxiety hardcore, it kills my light. I feel when I'm not weighed down from my critical self thought, I'm so free, buzzing through the air, all smiles and warm to everyone I see. people fuckin hate that, and it's so easy for them to stomp on me\nSorry you got me on a bad day lol 
2	It sounds like you should transfer to a college that will fit you. It might be a hassle to do that but why suffer in an environment you hate? You are not trapped.
2	I feel like ENFPs never really fit in. That‚Äôs our blessing and curse. We can adapt to plenty of environments and manage to be well liked but it has to be an environment that is accepting of people that are quirky. You won‚Äôt be happy as an ENFP in a place with too many rules or structures unless you find a way to be yourself comfortably in it
2	Hmmm... for me I see myself as different. A lot of my friends kind of just want to go the conventional route, and they seem disinterested in debates about issues like poverty and civil wars around the world. However, I'm pretty interested in social issues like those and love debating, and I like going a more unexplored route. My friends do get turned off by that.
336	This is a very ENFP thing to do, how caring!	
42	Regardless of type, this is a very human thing to do :') mad respect to that individual.
24	Seems more like a "generous and forward-thinking person" thing than a distinctly ENFP or type-related thing, haha
34	This strikes me as more of an ENFJ thing to do (FeNi vs NeFi), but either way it‚Äôs  really caring 
7	r/HumansBeingBros
4	Yay for ENFP!!\n\nI want an ENFP manager!
3	I love it. 
3	Very cool ‚ù§Ô∏è
1	That‚Äôs a good idea, in case I ended up in that situation. Thanks.
33	DAE do massive amounts of work in a pinch.	I for my life can't do something before a deadline but once the deadline is looming I can get an absurd amount of stuff done. I know that procrastination is an ENFP thing, but do any of you other ENFP's get away with procrastinating very easily?
14	yep, but gives me soo much stress and anxiety.. \n\nif anyone has got any tips to stop procrastinating lmk 
8	I am a pro at procrastination.
6	I once wrote a 20 page paper in 2 hours. Wikipedia helped...
2	It's like going to war with and betting your life on it. I always asked why I kept doing this to myself. I do realize how fast one action ends and the next begins though. But it comes with compromises, you do have to pay the price with quality but it's usually of passing grade
1	Yep- and often, it's my best work!\n\nGenerally I try not to do this when working for somebody else, however, because I think about the consequences potentially late work can have on a project.
1	Every morning between snoozing once more, and making my train on time
1	I do some of my best work under a reasonable amount of pressure!
1	Is it disrespectful to take advice as a suggestion??	
1	Isnt this guy an ENTP?
2	How do you utilize Ne?	It seems like I just use my Ne to consume info on whatever topic I Fi feel passionate about. How can I use Ne effectively?
14	The thing about iNtuition functions (both Ne and Ni), is it's passive intelligence.  As opposed to active intelligence, where you consciously produce a logical outcome, passive intelligence is in the background and on-going, often times leading you to conclusions that you can't exactly explain why it makes sense, it simply does.\n\nSo, Ne is one of those traits that you don't really "utilize" (or at least I don't), it just invades every aspect of your life without your consent.  In mother Russia, Ne utilizes you. 
2	Ne is just grand. --INTJ
2	I think of using Ne as seeing connections. For example, if someone tells me something, I think ‚ÄúOH! That‚Äôs just like this other thing over here!‚Äù Or here is a better example. I was watching Wreck It Ralph the other night, and I kept saying ‚ÄúOMG, doesn‚Äôt his personality remind you of so and so‚Äù to my husband. Or ‚Äúthat‚Äôs like the situation your brother was in.‚Äù Ne is a comparisons game or a game of word associations. 
1	Are you sure you're not INFP? Because that is how an INFP says he uses Ne. Only foir stuff he cares about with Fi. Limited.\n\nTry this. Imagine a spoon and try to think of as many things as you can to use it for besides eating. Go wild. He couldn't really do it because it was too abstract from him. I can name 50 easy.
17	Why ENFPs Need Discipline To Gain Freedom	
1	Motivational Monday!	\nToday is a new day! A fresh week! An opportunity start something new and get back into life. \n\nWhat inspires you, /r/ENFP?\n\nPost stories, quotes, and images that give you life. Need a little rally? Don't be shy posting your goals; let /r/ENFP give you a pep talk!\n
3	I will probably never get the words "I want to be just like you when I grow up" out of my head. I am not completely sure I have this adulting thing figured out already, but knowing that some kids I used to tutor as a college student look up to me somehow gives me the strength to work hard and finish my postgrad degree.
2	I'm falling in love for the first time since my ex, and it's so exciting and scary. It's all going so fast and I have no desire to hold it back: last night before falling asleep in bed, I realized I was still smiling and couldn't stop - not that I wanted to anyway!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe seems to be everything I could have ever wanted and needed, makes me feel so secure, and with every touch I feel all the more warm - and he's a big toucher, so I get to feel it a lot! I was trying my best to hold back, but as soon as he held me and told me he was crazy about me, I felt that it was no use. :) I can barely describe how excited I am to move forward and let our relationship blossom! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are some concerns I suppose, but none of them relate to his behavior or anything he's said. I'm worried that others will disapprove of the age difference - him being about 10 years older, me at 26 and him at 35. I'm worried that some people will be bothered by his race (especially my father) considering he's from Turkey. And of course I'm horrified that it'll all take a turn for the worse and end in more heartache.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut nothing has felt this right in a long, long time. And when he tells me he wants to always be there with me, and I look in his eyes, I see no reason to disbelieve anything he says. We have some amazing times ahead of us - and I feel so blessed that I get to experience it! :) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n/Sap out
3	what potential life advice would you give to someone in there late teens	anything that seems appropriate, mostly careers tho if you can
17	Grammar is important. Learn the difference between their/there/they‚Äôre, too/to/two, your/you‚Äôre, etc. This will take you far and earn you respect from your peers. 
11	Advice from a non ENFP.\n\nThe other types really do appreciate you ENFPs, they just suck at expressing and explaining why they do appreciate you.  Note this is not just an INTJ thing, pretty much all the Sensors and Intuitives appreciate some of the things that make ENFPs...into ENFPs we just find it hard to explain with words and actions.  And it is hard **to do** something when you find it hard to think of a word, or think of it visually, it is hard to make this appreciation known to you the ENFPs.\n\nWe other types get better but ***it just takes some time***, yet during your ENFPs teenage years it is a really big deal to feel appreciated and part of a group and you feel valued in that group.
7	Don't indulge in bad addictive habit, we are very prone to addictions because we focus a lot on bodily pleasure and it makes it easy for us to get into bad habits. 
8	Save your money\n\nDo what you love regardless the pay\n\nDont spend on things that are not needed at all\n\nCheap is not always better or good. 
5	Don't wait. I spent most of my life thinking "Someday..." and that I was too young. But you aren't and someday will never come unless you do it. Now. All the people out there doing stuff are young, even your age. Join them and make your mark.
4	Having worked at a terrible job makes you appreciate a great job when you have it. Never forget your awful jobs. \n\nRespecting people regardless of position or hierarchy goes a long way.  You would be surprised who has the boss's ear sometimes. Sometimes it may be your boss's boss. \nI am a city employee and I had several interactions with our mayor without knowing who he was. Same with city council members. \n\nLeave a paper trail. Especially with  coworkers/managers who have shady business practices. It could save your job. \n\n
3	high school is so irrelevant so don‚Äôt worry about it
2	From an ENFP: Slow. Down. Don't try and figure out your whole life right now. Experiment, explore and enjoy life. Don't get too caught up in the typical life path. We don't often end up happy when we do. Travel the world, do Peace Corps, volunteer, help people, and live in your heart.
2	With the limited context, I'd just say to find something where can really connect with others and/or express yourself. \n
21	ENFPs and books!	Im just your everyday enfp, i have had this problem for my entire life  ,i cant just sit and read a book ,it is just too boring of an activity for me id rather watch multiple 2m videos ,its even hard for me to watch moives but not as hard as books , i had this this TOM CLANCY'S books for two years and its still not finished ,but when it comes novels there are audiobooks and it is boring as well but i can tell myself i finished a book ,but the most thing im intrested it rn is CHESS and as you can tell you cant have cess related audiobooks or it just not as informative .\nIf a YT video has summery in the description i just read it and skip and  video ,if an article has bold points (eg WIKI HOW) i just read the headlines and save time,and let me make this clear i have nothing to do my life been has been journey between the fridge and social media and it is making me anxious....\nAny ENFP with the same struggle? Did you got it SOLVED? \n(SORRY FOR MY ENGLISH AND LONG POST )
28	I actually love reading, it can be difficult to start the book, so the first few chapters are the hardest for sure. But I like reading a lot better than movies. 
16	This is actually not an ENFP thing, although many suffer from it, because a lot of people are like this. \n\nThis is what happens when you dont exercise your mind for reading. Practises like scrolling through feeds of Facebook, instagram, Reddit, and like watching TV or playing video games have trained us to have shorter attention spans. Because everything is so instant and we dont have to work nearly as much to process the information, our brains get lazy when it comes to reading.\n\nI may not have this entirely correct, but something along these lines.\n\nIf you want to get back into reading, pick up some hobby magazines with interesting articles, read some short stories, try novels meant for young adults first. Start shorter and easier and train your brain to be interested again. \n\nI too have the same problem, even with books I enjoy. It really takes practice and the motivation to get back into reading.\n\nUnless! Reading just isn't an activity you like to do! That could be it too! We can learn so much in other ways, it's not always absolutely necessary to read anymore. 
4	i struggle with non-finction books, but if its a book im very interested in i get quiet obssesed with it. i relate to you on the article one tho
3	same here! my attention span is abysmal. starting books are always the hardest humps for me, it‚Äôs when i usually decide whether to stop entirely if it doesn‚Äôt catch my attention or if i should give my 100% into speed-reading it. once it has my attention, i‚Äôll delve into it 100% and can spend all my free time reading. for the same reason, i can never get into tv series because i have problems with committing my attention. movies are slightly easier but i can only sit through it in the cinema where it‚Äôs dark and there‚Äôs no other distraction around. 
3	HOLY FUCK! dude I am with you!, I can't read a book to save my life. IM always wondering off, I always felt like there was a problem with me but really it was just that i dont to stand still. Thats why I got audio books when Im taking a walk or travailing really far.
3	Same here, but not always. It also depends by the topic (if it‚Äôs not a novel) and/or how it‚Äôs written.\n\nFor example, I ALWAYS struggled with classic novels (those where the author starts describing what I see as _insignificant details_).\nThe famous novel ‚ÄúOn the road‚Äù from Jack Kerouac is known as one of those books that normal people reads in few hours/days. Well, it took to me 30 months.\nOn the other hand, WHEN i find a book that captures my interest, I can read it very quickly.\n\n\nExcluding novel books, I usually enjoy the following topics:\n\n- programming (and related computer topics)\n- philosophy \n- psychology \n- history\n- politics\n- sociology\n\nI also have some novel writers:\n\n- Chuck Palahniuk (author of Fight Club)\n- Irvine Welsh (author of Trainspotting)\n- Stephen King (not all his books, but well, I like him)\n- Charles Bukowsky\n\nIn these days (read: this week) I‚Äôm reading/studying ‚ÄúThe ENFP Survival Guide‚Äù. Already completed half the book with no effort.\n\nSo, like many other things, maybe it‚Äôs just a matter of finding the right topic/author/content you enjoy.\nMy only advice is: force yourself to leave the comfort zone, try new things, do‚Äôt expect instant enjoyment/success, keep experimenting ;-)\n\n
3	Go to /r/adhd and read people stories. If you're like me, you will be surprised "why are these people knowing my whole life story?"
2	For me, first and foremost is the story. \n\nBecause.  It does not matter what form the storytelling takes for me.\n\nThere are advantages to reading and everyone knows this is true. There are also advantages to taking vitamins but we don't always take our vitamins either.\n\nIn my opinion, there are more *disadvantages* to not listening to stories then there are from avoiding stories.\n\n\*awkward one-armed intj hug. \n\nGo forth, Young *ENFP* and enfp yourself as you will and with *what you do* will do best...\n\nYes and now hear a story from a bonnie handsome storyteller.\n\n... and tell him that a Sassenach lassie said that he's a wee bonnie storyteller who wears his kilt just fine. \n\nBecause I am listening to stories before breakfast, I am a wee bit hungry and a wee bit feeling silly.\n\n[https://youtu.be/UYLrn8iIYmM](https://youtu.be/UYLrn8iIYmM)
2	I read like I need it to survive. I must be an anomaly. 
2	Learn to love audio books, my friend. My wife and I bought audible through Amazon. Audio Books allow me to enjoy the stories within books while also multi-tasking.
2	I think having a short attention span (or ADHD or anything that makes it hard to concentrate) can affect any type\n\nPersonally, I love to read! It can be harder when I haven‚Äôt done it in a while or when mental health issues get in the way. If I‚Äôm 1/4 or so through a book and it‚Äôs boring af, I tend to just set it aside, look up how it ends out of curiosity and start a new book\n\nTry different genres. Not everyone is into the classics or into YA books if they‚Äôre a teenager. If drama and romance isn‚Äôt your thing, try horror and thrillers, adventure or fantasy
2	Try Emerson, his essays are dense, but written so beautifully that even if you just read a few paragraphs at a time, you can sit with that feeling for a while
2	I totally understand where you are coming from. I had that problem for the longest time! But the trick is finding the right type of books you‚Äôll find interesting.\n\nI thought at first it was dystopian novels for me, but I could never finish them. However, I realized, personally fiction books with really strong character development is what reals me in. \n\nYou have to find the right type of book for you and it‚Äôs practice. The more you read the better you‚Äôll get at attention as well as comprehension. \n\nI just got into reading this year, so you really can start anytime! You‚Äôve got this!
2	god thats relateable. I sometimes cant even watch tv shows becuase they are "not good enough"
2	It sounds like you might have ADD.
2	I probably have like 6 books I‚Äôm halfway through around my apartment 
2	ENFP with a PhD in English here! My specialty is American Poetry and Poetics, and I can recommend poetry for ENFP's for two reasons:\n\n1. Poems tend to be much shorter than other genres, so they can grab your interest or you can skip them, reading lots of different things back to back.\n\n2. At its core, poetry is about sociality and how we as humans relate and communicate with one another. When you find poetry that starts engaging with your extroversion, it's easy to get super excited about poems and poets real quick.\n
1	I love reading so much, but I have a problem starting books, reading the first chapter, then getting bored and starting another. I‚Äôm currently 1 chapter into ‚ÄúYou Learn by Living‚Äù (Eleanor Roosevelt), ‚ÄúAnne of Green Gables‚Äù (I love children‚Äôs lit), ‚ÄúHP & the Sorcerer‚Äôs Stone‚Äù (2nd time), ‚ÄúAbba‚Äôs Child‚Äù (Brennan Manning), and ‚ÄúSome of My Best Friends are Black: The Strange Story of Integration in America‚Äù (Tanner Colby). Lol 
1	I was the same until I made the conscious decision to improve my attention span. \n\nI started reading on my morning commute. I'll be honest, it was mainly for the aesthetic. How adorable is it to dress up nice for work and have a a classic literature book on your lap peeking out of an old fashioned streetcar? I hate the look of a million people in suits staring at their smartphones in the tram. \n\n\n(Tram : \nhttps://goo.gl/images/oNQ9Aj )\n\n(Girl reading on commute inspo : https://www.instagram.com/p/BiwOdINBC1I/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=hf2swy0xz3rc) \n\nIt gives me a huge confidence boost every morning, and sometimes I even actually like the book enough to continue reading it in other places. But even if I'm not a huge fan, I inevitably finish it at a steady pace because I force myself to take that time to read.\n\nAlso, if I have plans to meet someone for dinner or drinks or anything, I'll aim to arrive half an hour early and order a drink and read until they get there (bonus if it's a drink based on what I'm reading! Hemingway = old fashioned cocktail, Dickens = tea, Tolstoy = vodka drink, classic female author = maybe wine...). \n\nThey key principles for me are:  \n\n- to read in public to look cute and be seen. I know it's ridiculous but it works for me. \n\n- keep it for scheduled short bursts like your commute. Its perfect for me because it's time I would've spent flicking through my phone anyway. I started doing this in 2017 and have read about 15 classics since then, just by sheer virtue of reading 15-45mins per weekday \n\n- the book must be PORTABLE. No hardcovers or cover sleeves or giant pages. Every book has to fit in my purse. Somebody bought me the (at the time) brand new hardcover of Harry potter and the cursed child but it is so bulky I will probably never get around to reading it, unfortunately. \n\n\nI realise all of these reasons are incredibly superficial but who cares if it works?? \n\nIt actually has helped my attention span a ton, and in addition, helps maintain my English, as I am a native speaker living in a non English part of the world where everyone's working English is totally mangled and I have to simplify my speech to be understood. Reading ensures I don't lose my natural native level of sophistication (not a brag, everyone is at least somewhat sophisticated in their native language).
4	Am I a cold hearted bitch?	Hello fellow ENFP-ers. I‚Äôve sometimes been typed as an ENFJ, but after research I truly believe I am an ENFP (with ADD). So let me go into the story...\n\nIt‚Äôs me second semester senior year and High School overall (socially has been amazing). I‚Äôm known as the outgoing, funny girl, who talks to everyone. However even though I have ‚Äòclose‚Äô friends, my connections feel one sided. I feel like people are closer to me, than I am to them. I am like an open book, but the truly deep things I (not on purpose) I keep in. \n\nRecently I cut connections with two of what I considered my closest friends, let me explain really briefly:\n\nFriend 1 was basically in a group (I left cause it was toxic) that was being mean to people. They did something messed up to a girl and I blocked them on social media and am not friends with this guy who was my closest for some years.\n\nFriend 2 is someone I‚Äôve had a bad feeling with for a while. Even though we were so close I‚Äôve always had this off feeling. She seemed like she tried to one up me and lied to me sometimes for ego reasons. Recently she did something VERY petty that was a major inconvenience for me and almost cost me hundreds of dollars. She never apologized but never said it was an accident either. She is still trying to be my friend but to be honest I feel very disgusted/disappointed by her.\n\nNow to the question I need you guys (who understand me in a way no one else can) to help me with.\n\nWhy am I okay? Even if they did shitty things I should be at least a little sad all those years spent together are kind of over. \n\nAlso, why have I been acting differently lately? I know ENFP‚Äôs need some alone time to process emotions but it‚Äôs been like that for a long time. I‚Äôve never been someone who reads but know I can‚Äôt stop reading good fiction books. \n\nI never feel super overwhelmed or happy or sad, just alway eh. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs up with me but I don‚Äôt feel close to anyone. Like I have many friends that I enjoy talking to, but on my part I don‚Äôt feel connected. I am alone, but not in a sad alone way. \n\nCan anyone relate to my off tangent story? Any advice? Kind of desperate? 
6	Always remove those waving red flags. 
7	I feel like you did yourself good by removing them as friends. They just seem like bad people, which is always good to steer away from.
3	TLDR; you're neither cold hearted nor a bitch. You saw people being toxic and mean, it would've been very bad for you mentally to continue subjecting yourself to that kind of atmosphere. Hugs ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nWhen I was 14, I was hanging out with similar people to how you described your friends. I understood on some level that I didn't want to become like my friends, so I let them go at the risk of being lonely/having no friends. It was the right decision. \n\nNow being past teenage years and well into becoming an adult (almost 30, but still don't feel like a real adult), I've had to do the same a few times. Every time I feel like crap for being cruel with cutting people off, but still relieved for doing so as I knew the people weren't good for me and there was nothing I could do to save them from their harmful ways. 
3	Being "nice" to everyone isn't the same thing as being obligated to be friends with everyone. People did things you don't like. You stopped being friends with them because of that. That's having boundaries. Healthy.\n\nYou're only responsible for your own feelings. It's a lot easier to only be responsible for yourself. Chin up. You did the right thing with those people. And this is all to say why you feel okay with yourself. It sounds to me like no one ever told you that you don't have to take care of everyone else's feelings, but it is totally okay to just do what is right for you. So you did, and you're fine with that. Peace be with you.
3	I'm pretty sure you're more likely an ENFJ just from this post and the way you write.\n\nPerhaps you don't feel bad about it because you never considered them your friends even though they were your "friends" this whole time.
1	xNxxs vs xSxxs	I‚Äôm really curious how you guys deal with the sensing types. I personally feel like the ExI TxF JxP matchings can all complement each other quite well but man oh man when it comes to NxS it all goes downhill.\n\nAnd according to [this](https://imgur.com/a/g0U5YE5), ENFPs really don‚Äôt match with the sensing types. At all. Romantically, at least.\n\nI have tons of sensing types as friends, best friends actually, but that means short periodical crazy meetings. Anything more than that...\n\nI‚Äôd like to hear some of your NxS experiences ^^\n\nTLDR: Just curious how you ENFPs feel about xSxxs types.
4	isfj and enfp is pretty sweet when the enfp is focused on harmony & the isfj has a clear goal
3	I can explain how and why ENFPs can be friendship or romantically involved with the 8 sensor types but it is complicated for each Sensor type has a different realtionship with the ENFP and I am too tired =P\n\nSo let me rephrase this, have you seen Sex and the City?  I will use this show to ask you a question.  \n\n* Q1) I ask you what benefit / draw does Carrie have with her friendship with Samantha.  \n\n* Q2) Do you think you personally, could date Samantha?
4	My best friend of 13 years is my complete opposite‚ÄîISTJ‚Äîand she compliments me perfectly. When any human being is mature, kind, and confident, it‚Äôs easy to be friends with them. 
2	Depends on how much stock you put into type pairings. I have my favorites of course, but the world isn't full of us ENTPs so I can't exactly be choosy lol.
2	I‚Äôm still learning about the intricacies of the personality types so I‚Äôm not the MOST knowledgeable.\n\nBut I‚Äôm an ENFP dating an ISTJ. We balance each other out very well. He‚Äôs my rock when I get overwhelmed and just too worked up about things, and I help pull him out of his shell and his comfort zone and have been teaching him that it is okay to express emotion and feelings.  He‚Äôs become more social in our time dating, and I‚Äôve been learning the value of alone/quiet time.\n\nHowever there are downsides too. He does get overwhelmed with my extroverted and feeling nature at times and I tend to get a little hurt when he tells me, no matter how gently he does so. I feel like I could tear my hair out some days wishing he would be a bit more communicative. \n\nBut all in all, it‚Äôs been a great 3+ year relationship and the checks and balances are right on the money. I think the key to dating someone so different from yourself is communication so each person knows where the other is coming from, or else it‚Äôs chaos.
2	isfps are cool and esfp's are good 
1	Maturity? One of my closest friends is an ESTJ and I choose to learn from her where my weaknesses match her strengths (it's nice for someone to just ground me when I'm in the clouds), and she enjoys exercising her inferior N with me because it gives her pride and confidence.
1	Well personally I don't "sense types" considering this bullshit is just Astrology on crack
1	Not an ENFP, but my 2 cents, type pairings are a load of bull.\n\nYou could argue that generally(key word), certain types mix better with some, than others, but it really comes down to the individuals. Ive met certain types that I'm supposed to get along with, that I couldn't stand. On the flipside, I've met others that I was supposed to butt heads with, that wound up becoming some of my closest friends.\n\nIf you take my type(ISTP), you'll find some that avoid people, and others that are more sociable. Some that refuse to talk it out, others that understand communication is necessary.\n\nThink about it, regardless of someones tendencies(MBTI/cognitive functions), you have upbringing, location, life experiences, family, religion, personal choices, etc. all contributing to what makes them how they are. \n\nI can tell you straight up, I'm a bit different than a lot of other ISTPs(at least I think so). My mom is an ENFJ and my dad is an ISFJ, and they drilled some stuff into my head growing up thats not typical of ISTPs. They taught me to be more considerate of how my actions may affect others and the importance of communication. Now I still have my ISTP tendencies, but Im cognizant of the other side of the coin. That helps me to get along with certain types better than I would've, had I not had those experiences growing up. The same can happen to others.\n\nOn top of that, I've never seen a legit pairing/relationship theory. Every site says something different. And then you have those people who mix MBTI and Socionics(especially with relationships), like they're the same system. Socionics is a completely different system, even if the 2 look similar on the surface. You can't just mix and match when you feel like it. There is no crossover.\n\nAnyways, my point is, don't put too much weight behind the relational side of personality theory. Its about the individuals and what they're willing to put in, if needed.\n\nEdit: Made my point, but just wanted to add something. Think about how many mistypes there are, and how many people, "change," their type over time. The amount of people who can't type themselves or others makes this stuff useless on any practical level, even if there was a solid theory.
2	Unable to make the first move	I'm an extremely extroverted ENFP and I love people, but I can't be the first one to talk. In class at college I'll sit at a table and only talk to other people if they talk to me first. I get too anxious if I make the first move. I do have social anxiety, so that'd impact this a lot. Has anyone else experienced this and found good ways to overcome this problem? I've figured out good ways to force myself to talk first, but my heart is usually beating super fast when I actually do it that I don't even like to do it.
2	I usually go with a compliment! ‚ÄòI really like your hairstyle‚Äô, ‚Äòyour dress is gorgeous/really suits you‚Äô or something like that. I always make sure it‚Äôs a sincere comment. \n\nI find that way you flatter them and they‚Äôre usually be willing to jump into conversation :)
1	i'm not sure how much this can help but chew some gum, it helps with stress 
1	I struggled with Social Anxiety Disorder most of my life. I am mostly over it now. One thing to realize is this:\n\nWho are you thinking about pretty much all the time?\n\nYourself.\n\nYou are thinking about what you're doing and saying and how you come across.\n\nAnd guess what?\n\nSo is everybody else.\n\nLiterally everybody is way too concerned with themselves to think about what others are doing or care. Do you notice everything everyone else is doing? Do you remember it? No. And they don't either.\n\nSo relax and be yourself and be free.
23	This image really re-solidified to me that I‚Äôm an ENFP!	
11	"Ive given up on the whole human species, but I am thrilled by individuals"  YESSSS
4	I‚Äôve always tested as an ENFP but I recently have gotten more in depth with reading astrology and several aspects of my natal chart had me questioning if I wasn‚Äôt maybe an ENTP. I‚Äôve been reading a lot more into ENFP vs ENTP  and how they manifest especially as you grow older and become more self realized/actualized. Carlin and Hicks were some of my favorite comedians growing up, and I loved seeing this breakdown. The internal positivity while showing external criticism really resonates with me, as well as ‚Äúlooking down‚Äù on humanity as a whole but falling in love with people as individuals 
3	I'm a ENF/TP\nI get equal results in the F and T categories and have gotten results for either ENFP and ENTP.  Mehhh. 
2	Your friends‚Äô opinions about your crush	Is the approval from your friends important to you when it comes to your crush?\nI met a friend of my ENFP crush yesterday and later that day my crush told me his friend called him and said he thought I was nice. I wonder that if I was just a girl friend it would be relevant to pass on his friends‚Äô ‚Äúapproval‚Äù? What do you think?\n
2	I‚Äôm not really big on seeking approval on my love life. I love who I love and sometimes it only makes sense to me... which is fine. 
345	Like a lion in the savannah (xpost INFP)	
30	Hahaha i actually just enter the conversation.  Is that an ENFP trait?  I do it very consciously.. i dont just barge in or interrupt.. it‚Äôs pretty much  always well received.  But.. i definitely look like that and then just join in. 
8	I love what you did there.
4	SO TRUE. It's so hard not to come across like a creepy stalker.
5	Just waiting for that perfect moment, to throw in and dazzle them.
2	Veerrry accurate
2	Very me 
2	Relevant Picture.\n\nhttp://www.dangerouscute.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2013-04-25-20130425.jpg\n\nGetting an ENFP to sit on their hands and stay away from the conversation when this energy state, this mood is engaged, is like getting a 4 year old not to eat a marshmallow when you place the marshmallow on their dinner plate and you tell them they can eat it in 5 minutes but not right now, because of rules / authority of the giver of the marshmallow.\n\n*Nods*
1	I know that pain ;-;
1	that‚Äôs how i make friends with my friend‚Äôs friend while they are having a convo ü§£
1	This was me in class the other day lol
1	Yes! Just mental double dutching, waiting for the *right* moment and be awesome! ^or ^mumble ^and ^make ^no ^sense\n\nEdit: bc on mobile and I suck at cool edits
20	Maturing ENFP Heartbreak Mindset	"Ok I guess I'll just stop sharing my dreams with you, my dude."- me (24f)\n\nI really am starting to dislike how I am, how I can't seem to decide on what I want or need. I am constantly doubted and tire myself out trying to prove my worth while trying to live and love my heart out because I can't contain it sometimes.\n\nI feel a big hermit mode coming, like I don't want to trust more than the people I truly trust.\n\nI want to focus on the right things again. I guess for me that is school and career. Heart can go take a nap.\n\nHow old are you guys and how do you feel about the way and meaning of life?
16	26F here. I'm in a situation where I feel that not even my loved ones understands me nor do they want to try doing so. I am tired of trying to make everyone around me happy while feeling unappreciated and unfulfilled. Concentrating on our personal improvement can be a good thing to distract from the negative emotions we are having. Introspection can also help to reset our compass - I keep a journal for this purpose.\n\nI read this somewhere and its on my phone's lock screen now:  \n1. Believe patterns, not apologies.  \n2. Don't fall in love with potential.  \n3. Take red flags seriously.  \n4. Know your worth.  \n5. Don't lower your standards.\n\nI hope these words can guide you as well as it did for me.
6	41M, here. I know that feeling, I suppose it‚Äôs normal at your age. But there are good news: it will change for better in the near future, once you start understanding yourself better and know at least _what you don‚Äôt want for sure_.\nYeah, life as an ENFP could be shit sometimes (especially in younger age), but we‚Äôre so awesome üòé 
4	21M and I'm like confused most of the times. I want to be me and then the feedback from around and about makes me not want to be me and more of a synthetic human deliberately minding my own business which is alas wearily humdrum. 
3	This is honestly such a beautiful mode of mind. I and many others can relate to the feeling of drowning your heart in aspiration
3	Me every time I don't feel heard.. Like if you aren't going to engage with me like I'm engaging with you, I'm bored, I'm out.
3	Infj male here, my ENFP counterpart, I say that cause she can't really decide is in a similar place. We agreed to split but still live together, and obvi that leads to a few complications. I can say this, as sporadic as she can be, she has stuck to her guns of improving herself not only over the course of our relationship, but moreso this last year. Commitment is difficult for her, and despite our issues, I really admire all that she has done to try and set herself up in the right mindset and spiritually as well. She's not a very sharing kind of woman with her emotions, but that could also be discomfort. Anyway, the meaning of life as I derive from her is to be true to yourself before anything else. To fill one's cup so to say, with the love and appreciation of oneself, faults and flaws, as well as trials and triumphs. Her mind changes often, but she has committed to the journey of independent growth, and I could never place blame on her for doing something selfless, that could otherwise be deemed selfish by an untrained or unfamiliar eye. I honestly suggest taking a chance on yourself. I believe it will make all the difference. Even if I have to watch her from afar, I've never been more proud of her. 
1	Expressing Fi	I'm a 15 year old male ENFP. A problem I have is expression positive/wholesome emotions. I philosophized myself into thinking that my feelings will be taken advantage of in a social setting. This comes off to me as weird as other ENFPs I've observed, namely female, are much more fluent in regards to expressing warm emotions towards others. Part of me thinks that my emotions are hidden, apart from my goofiness and exuberance, because I hate the idea of somebody finding comedy in things I do genuinely. If I am to make a mistake and somebody turns that into an inside joke, I'll laugh along, but in reality it bothers me. In the same sense, I don't want people to find comedy in the contextual novelty of me being more warm and genuine and less ironic and joke cracking. It's annoying because I feel like warmth and love is a more honest articulation of who I am. Should I open up more, and if I should, how do I open the Carly Rae Jepson part of me and tone down my 2010 Bo Burnham side?
3	This is the hidden Se side of an ENFP.  The shadow / subdued Se side of an ENFP.\n\nRead this but especially the stuff about Se in it.\n\nhttps://www.sociotype.com/socionics/types/IEE-ENFp/\n\nIEE is the name for Socionics ENFP.  \n\nJust a warning before you continue.  ^(Socionics  and MBTI are both based off the original Carl Jung Psychological Types.  Note though reading the introvert types of Socionics is confusing for the 4 letter name of Socionics and 4 letter name of MBTI are not the same due to "grammar reasons."  I am pointing this out, **giving you a warning** in case you want to explore other parts of this specific website or other socionics website.  For example I am an MBTI INTJ / 3 letter name of ILI in Socionics but it can also go by the 4 letter Socionics name of an INTp which is different than the MBTI's INTP.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou can't really control another person's behavior, you also can't control their feelings, their humor, their language, their value system, their thinking, and a whole host of other things.\n\nAll humans have very little control when you think about it.\n\nOne of the things we do control is we can choose to externally express some things, such as externally express some words, or express some feelings, but even then we can't "speak into being" the ***whole entire picture*** we may feel internally some things but when we try to speak it into being some of the things we want to express do not come out while some of it is made visible.  ***And that is okay.***\n\nIt is okay for the person you are inside to be not 100% congruous with what other people ***think you are*** via seeing your body, the simulacrum of flesh your mind moves via thought, it is okay for these things not to line up perfectly.\n\nWhat is a an image, what is a painting, what is an simulacrum^(an image or representation of someone or something.  Often an unsatisfactory imitation or substitute.) ?  Life is like a Monet painting, or a Pierre Auguste Renoir.\n\n[Links to a pretty image](https://www.pierre-auguste-renoir.org/thumbnail/79000/79471/mini_large/The-Doges-Palace-Venice.jpg?ts=1459229076)\n\n
3	I have been racking my brain trying to figure out a good response to this... I definitely think opening up more is good, but it's hard to be vulnerable though. \n\nMy ideal world would be full of hugs and "I love yous," but I hold back because that ideal world only works if those things are well-received and reciprocated. That's the thing though... basically everyone holds back for the same reasons. No one wants to be rejected, mocked, or looked down on. We all have our insecurities, but the only way to get past any of that it to... Well, do it. \n\nFor me, it's easier to be warm/affectionate to a group of people... it's less intimate. It's a thousand times easier to say"I love you guys" than it is to tell one person "I love you." There is less at stake with a group because each individual can do with your comment what they will. It might mean a lot to someone and not even get processed by another. No one feels obligated to reciprocate and or reject the sentiment because it doesn't fully belong to anyone. \n\nI was not very warm or genuine when I was 15. I held a lot back. It takes a lot of time and effort to be emotionally mature. There are still things I'm working on, but I can't think of a time where I opened up and then regretted it... it's not always easy or as rewarding as I'd prefer, but it is worth it.
1	ENFP Career Change	Hi everyone,\n\nSo I've taken the Myers-Briggs type indicator countless times but have never really felt 100% connected to any one personality type, as I'm too indecisive and overthink every question the tests ask. I recently took the 16personalities test again and my result was ENFP, but prior to that I had gotten ENTP the past handful of times I had taken it. After reading the differences between Fi/Te and Ti/Fe, it became clear to me that the traits of ENFP are actually more similar to me than those of ENTP; this was compounded when I realized strengths and weaknesses outlined for ENFPs were the same/very similar to the ones I exhibit.\n\nThe results of this test come at a great time in my life, as I've recently been struggling to plan what direction I'd like to take my life and have been unable to choose one. I'm currently working as a tax associate at a public accounting firm, a career that was suggested to me by my mom while in community college because "it's a stable and well-paying career." I did well in my accounting classes at CC but realized accounting wouldn't be for me while taking accounting classes when I transferred to a 4-yeae University. However, being a people pleaser/momma's boy, I was determined to give it a shot and fixate on the parts of the job I excel most at, like networking/recruiting and challenging myself to learn new things and grow.\n\nBut it has come to a point where I know public accounting is not a career I wish to pursue long-term, as the hours required during busy season are too long for someone who isn't passionate about the work. I desperately need to shift my career towards something I'm passionate about and would excel in, but it's a difficult prospect because it will require me to apply for jobs I have limited or no experience in.\n\nI've decided the best course of actions for me would either be to pursue a career in education (professor, teacher, education policy) because teaching and mentoring others is my greatest passion, or pursue an MBA so that I can potentially manage a nonprofit organization one day. The latter would be an easier transition because I've worked with a lot of nonprofit organization in tax and have a good understanding of how they operate, but I'd want to get out of the tax/financial side asap. I'm also very interested in psychology/philosophy and wouldn't mind continuing my education in either of those areas, but because I've already gotten my 4-year degree I'm afraid it may be too late to pursue either of those fields.\n\nTL;DR: I need to make a career shift that best fits me, but I'm unsure of the next steps and was wondering if any other ENFPs have been in a similar situation. If you've gone through a career change early on in your career, who/what were some of the resources you utilized? I'm afraid of making a jump until I have a plan, but making plans aren't my strong suit, so the stress of thinking about this has been weighing on me quite a bit lately.\n\nI really appreciate any and all advice/experiences people are able and willing to share! :)
3	Most people don‚Äôt use their bachelor‚Äôs degrees. I graduated with a bachelor‚Äôs in Biology in May and I recently got hired with my state‚Äôs Child Protective Services as an assistant. In August I‚Äôll be pursuing a Masters in Social Work. Anything is possible :) 
14	I feel like I bear the burden of peoples secrets, I feel like I see through people	I don't, know if its just me, but I attract a lot of very interesting and sometimes very broken people. I have found out somethings about people that no one will ever know. Sometimes dark secrets about alternate lives, sometimes actions that people have done that would make you reconsider what kind of people they are, some times things they have done that are completely out of character.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould I get more specific? I found out a friend is a cross dresser. I someone I dated, later I found out was a call girl. Friends that have cheated. Friends that have affairs. People that sleep around. People that have dark flaws.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't think these are bad people. I don't think people are bad in general. I've seen bad people. These aren't them. These are dark secrets. I don't know why I see through everyone. I don't know why these people stick around me. Some times I just want some normal people, with some boring hobbies and nonexistant history.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm making an much more of an effort now a days to not fix people, not to date broken fix-er-uppers. But for some reason I still feel like people around me have some missing pieces. I don't know if its just that I see through people now, or they really are bound to me.\n\nMaybe I'm just trippin.
4	Maybe because people looks at you as a brilliant/non-standard mind capable of understand them and provide smart/thoughtful advice.\nOn the other hand, you‚Äôre fascinated by different point of views to explore and analyze.\n\n\nDon‚Äôt forget you‚Äôre an ENFP.
2	I understand where you are coming from.  Just last week I was meditating on why I don't mix a lot of my "buddies"(in contrast to my well rounded and closer friends) with each other or my other friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI came to the conclusion and wrote down in my Journal, "I collect broken and beautiful things".  I have so many broken ones in my life that I've found something beautiful inside.  They don't quite work in "polite" company and normally we spend our time alone. Many of my other friends have no concept of how I can enjoy my time with them.  I do not mind trudging through a swamp for a bit to find a hidden treasure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen it comes to the urge to fix everyone, it sounds like you are on the right track.  It is impossible.  But, your time attention and healthy emotional example can be a big help.  Just love your fellow man in thought and action, it is the best gift you can give.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMuch Love.
1	Can we speak privately about this? Do you have skype/discord?
1	Thanks
11	Are we considered the most airhead/ditzy personality type?	Are we considered the most absent minded and ditzy personality type? Like people think we are dumb, Smiley, naive, not aware, and silly? Like a stereotypical dumb blonde?
8	Yes, but I think a lot of people mistake resilience for naivete.
6	honestly yeah, but i'd say those who are closer to us realise that we're actually quite deep and profound. i'd say ESFPs are considered the most though, while we come in a close second. 
11	Some people think this based on a stereotype that is based on immature ENFP's who are all Ne and seem random with no depth.
3	I would never use the term "ditzy" to describe myself ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Can't really say I've experienced this type of classification lol
3	Sometimes! Us ENFPs are also super bubbly and that can be mistaken for ditziness sometimes. We‚Äôre pretty smart though and are total social sponges even if we do come off as a little vapid sometimes. Personally, I like it! I‚Äôm really bubbly so people can sometimes write me off as a ditz but that just gives me a secret advantage over them. Like, yesss, please, let your guard down around this dumb brunette so I can better psychoanalyze you 
5	Not to me anyways.\n\nWell, as the the stereotypical dumb blonde. 
4	in short, lol yeah 
3	It could be argued that ESFPs are just as bad in that department. I would say it is a toss up on which is worse.
2	Yes
1	Hopefully not lol.
1	ESFP has many of this but won't stop talking ;)))
1	Is a open-relationship possible if only one of them is wanting the openness?	Hi folks!\n\nSo I'm in a kind of relationship and my other half wants to have an open relationship.\n\nShe doesn't want to feel limited when it comes to meet new people. I can understand that, but I'd prefer it not to be open, or not so open. From my side, if I was fine with her, I wouldn't pay attention to anybody else.\n\nI feel like open-relationships are less committed and this person is very important for me, so asking for an open relationship makes me feel I'm not so important for her or she isn't taking our relationship seriously.\n\nI'm feeling anxious and concerned, do you have any advice for me?
10	In general, I don't think it works as well if only one person wants it to be open. It changes the dynamics of the relationship. There are some subreddits that answer this question regularly, maybe search nonmonogamy or ethical nonmonogamy for some answers?\nOpen relationships can be just as committed and loving as monogamous relationships, but I would encourage you that if you're not fully interested in either the open setup or fully convinced by her loyalty to you, you guys shouldn't decide yet whether to open it up.  
9	Dont make compromise with yourself or your feelings in fear of being rejected. If you want different things out of your relationship it might be hard making it work.
3	Open relationships can still be just as committed. Just like you can have more than one friend or be close with more than one parent or sibling. It is not that you have a finite amount of love to give.\n\nIf you decide to pursue an open relationship just make sure you are checking in with how it is going. If you feel like you aren't feeling cared for or seeing them as much as you would like because their attention is too focused elsewhere then say so. \n\nMaybe talk about the kind of open relationship they would like and read up on it - do they just want to be committed to you but seek out casual fun with others? Do they not want to seek anything out but want to be able to follow a spark if they meet someone? Are they interested in dating others or just keeping it mainly to sex? \n\nUltimately it is only going to work if you want it too. You'll have a better time with them seeing other people if you also get to enjoy the excitement of feeling those first time butterflies with someone new too.
2	That's up to you. You probably have enough imagination to put yourself in such a scenario in your mind. Imagine how you would feel. Think about why your partner wants an open relationship to begin with. What does love, sex and a relationship mean to your partner? Do you look at these things with similar eyes? To me it sounds like she doesn't really care much about or isn't aware of the emotional depth of the connection true pair-bonding sex can bring but rather prefers the physical stimulus and released oxytocin from it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the end it's mainly up to what your Fi tells you and also introspection will come in handy.
2	in my experience, it doesn‚Äôt work too well. even if you want to have an open relationship, jealousy is a serious aspect that has to be worked through. and if you don‚Äôt have the desire to do that work, it‚Äôs going to plague you. even in the most successful open relationships, time management is a major part of keeping things running well. and again, if you don‚Äôt have the internal motivation to do a good job of managing your time with your SO and accepting that they‚Äôll have to manage theirs...you‚Äôre going to end up with hurt feelings. \n\nin short, i don‚Äôt recommend it. sorry. üòï
6	ENFP Self Imposed Prison To Gain Freedom	
1	Later
14	Smothering and Being Smothered	I've been reading in the Comprehensive ENFP Survival Guide about how we are need to be extra conscious of the need others (especially the more introverted types) have of independence, alone time, etc. We have a natural tendency to flood people with a smothering amount of love and enthusiasm.\n\nI went through a (long) phase were I felt like none of my friendships were really very solid because I didn't have anyone who was willing to hangout every waking second of the day. Every relationship I had felt shallow and superficial. There is a lot more to that, but I realized even before reading the book that my expectations of friendship were not very realistic and that most of my problem was a flawed perception.\n\nI have a solid group of friends who have more than proven themselves to be loyal, supportive, and genuine, but I still always want to do more than they do, and the temptation to drown them with love and affection is real. \n\nThat said, there are other people I know (especially extroverts) who would probably be more open to that downpour of love and attention, but I'm not interested in investing in those friendships that way. There are even some that reach out frequently and I (rather hypocritically) feel smothered.\n\nMy close friends (the ones I love the most...even though I love everyone) are usually introverts, and they are the ones that are least open to my overflowing love and affection, which leads me to my actual question... Anyone relate to that? Wanting to pour out love and affection on those that are resistant to it and being yourself resistant to the love and affection of certain others? \n\n\n\n\n
5	You literally have helped me realize what the fuck I‚Äôve been trying to say but have been a literal hard time finding the correct way to say it. Thank you 
4	[deleted]
2	Think of yourself having 4 energy levels.  I am going to label them with 4 directions that will make sense at the very end.\n\n* North,  Maximum Energy.  Your Energy Level when it is over-flowing.\n\n* East, Optimum Energy.  Your Energy being channeled into a productive task, a tax that is in the flow zone where it is difficult but not too difficult, a task that requires your attention and requires your skill but not too skillful and complicated.\n\n* South, Minimum Energy.  This is your energy level when you over-extend yourself, it is also your energy level in tasks that does not energize you and the task itself is repetitive.\n\n* West, Recharge Energy, Pessimism Energy.  This is your energy level when you are trying to recharge yourself, this is your energy level that finds it able to do simple things but not complex things.\n\nNow think of these 4 things as a Circle, and that is why I labeled them North, East, South, West for think of them as a circle that is rolling, rolling, rolling.  All types including the ENFPs will have a  mixed kind of life where certain tasks in life will trigger the mixture of these 4 different energy states but certain tasks will be more of some of these energy states and less of others.\n\nAnd your MBTI type such as ENFP will find certain aspects of specific task triggering some of those 4 energy states more than other tasks, but take another MBTI task and they may be energized by the things that drain an ENFP and so on.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhy I am bringing this up?  Well I willing to bet money that certain things your friends that make you feel smothered, the ones that are more extroverted are doing some things, or asking for development of things that drain you and you are just not aware these things drain you, or they take your time away, or they act like a brake, and so on.\n\nWhile your other friends, the more introverted ones, they probably are providing other things you haven't realized things that help launch you, who help recharge you, who help energize you and you feel mobilized and activated, like someone gave you rocket fuel energy to your rocket that was running out of fuel, and besides giving you rocket fuel they were also pointing out directions that will lead to adventure, to development, to challenges, to creativity, and so on.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo what are those things?  I am curious \^_\^
1	This was the case for me in some ways until I started to branch out in my relationships :)\n\nI realized that ‚Äúclose‚Äù is different for different people and my relationships with friends will vary. Some friends I have very active relationships with and others are more slow and steady, like rabbit friends and turtle friends. But I love them all and when I find myself needing ‚Äúmore‚Äù in some ways, I make new friends, learn new things, go new places, etc.\n\nI guess that novelty and exploration keep me from being ‚Äúsmothering‚Äù or unsatisfied. Also, accepting the boundaries of others and working toward contentment within myself
1	I am in the exact same situation... :S
15	Do you guys ever get bummed out about being the most enthusiastic person in the room?	I very much feel like it's an ENFP thing to get super hyped for every hang out/social experience and I always get a little bummed when I show up ready to cause some trouble and everyone is like . . . a normal, non-ENFP level of enthuasiasm. Like come onnnn, aren't you happy to be here? \n\nI'm a little bummed rn bc I got cancelled on by my (INTJ?) fuckbuddy for tonight. And I had like the worst, most stressful week ever so I was really looking forward to it. They cancelled plans bc they had something to do, which I understand, but I'm still just bummed.
9	Yeah, but we just as easily get over disappointment by finding something new to distract us!
4	You sneaky devil, baiting us in with a completely unrelated topic. Somewhat agree but I‚Äôve gotten older I‚Äôve learned to adjust. 
4	I very much relate to it. I'm an ENFJ and my levels of enthusiasm for people and situations often go through the roof and are unmatched bye anyone else around... Sometimes it does feel strange.
5	When I appoint myself in charge of Moral.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03Y3UpZSbkA\n\n
2	The other day I saw a football (soccer) match, my class against another class, and I'm really not a sports player or fan. Still I was the biggest cheer. I yelled every time the other team scored and screamed every time we did. I was so pumped up. I just love cheering, espesially for friends! 
2	Yes I feel that. When no one can match my level/ feels like I‚Äôm carrying whoever is there 
4	My social ability has died. Pls help	Hi all. So I need some advice!\n\nOk so firstly I've been an enfp since I was in high school. It's been a really consistent thing and I've always identified with those characteristics. I had amazing friends in college who brought out the extroverted side of ne (not to say I didn't need social breaks) but I was happy and sure of who I was. I've stayed on to do a third year of college doi g less practical subjects which are kinda eh. I just need to e to get experience fir my uni course. The first years are just a nightmare though. They gave this totally different set of values that go against mine. I'm really anti drug for a long list of reasons and everyone seems to be getting high on God knows what and they are quite cruel about the fact they know I dont like it. Theres very few people anymore I feel i can connect with and I've kinda hidden in my introverted shell and I just feel like I've changed so lately. I mean socially I've just gone bwep and I can barely converse with people anymore. Mind blank. Awkwardness. It sucks!! I've been enfp every time I did the test but I'm like am I infp now? Can you change types or do any fellow enps get into ruts like this and just go into turtle mode? It's got to the point where I'm thinking I'm gonna have to get a studio for uni cus I just cant click with people anymore (besides the whole drug thing). Anyway advice would be muchio appreciated!\n\nCheers
3	It‚Äôs usually said that rather than changing type someone may rely heavily on certain functions and/or use certain functions less\n\nHave you thought about seeing a counselor? Just for advice because they‚Äôre probably used to students coming in with similar issues\n\nAlso, is your university big?? Mine had a lot of kids who were into drugs/heavy drinking but there were also a lot of people who weren‚Äôt into these things. You could find people who were into just about anything through classes and clubs/organizations\n\nGood luck üëçüèΩüëçüèΩ
2	When I am feeling depressed, overly stressed or inauthentic my energy for socializing goes out the window.  I think little moon witch's suggestion seek a bit of counseling, was good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBe patient with yourself.  Your life circumstances will change soon and you will probably be closer to people who match your ideals and morals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMuch love.
2	Adventure Time Sunday!	\n/r/ENFP! What shenanigans have you been up to this week? Any new adventures planned for the next?\n\nLet's here some stories!
2	trying to turn this mini rant into something constructive	hello fellow enfp‚Äôs! i haven‚Äôt posted in this subreddit in a while but this one will always be one of my favourites by far. i‚Äôm not even sure what i want to get out of this post, maybe just catharsis. \n\nbut here goes! things have been a rollercoaster ride lately. so much has changed. right now i just finished school so i have 6 months left before i enrol in university/college, whatever you call it. i‚Äôve dedicated myself to becoming better ‚Äî i‚Äôm picking up running again so maybe i can someday try out for a cross country team in uni. i‚Äôm signing up for rock-climbing courses because i love climbing. i‚Äôm reading more and trying to rationalise my emotions and my biases. i‚Äôm volunteering, interning and working at the same time to get as many experiences as possible. also i‚Äôm trying to forget my ex and i‚Äôm making progress but some nights, the hurt returns. i‚Äôm trying to be a better person, basically. and somehow... it just feels so isolating at times. i feel so alone, i‚Äôve lost contact with some friends i thought would stay throughout the years. i guess losing them was something that would have to come one day, because some of them were really toxic. i keep the true ones close though and i‚Äôm so grateful for them. \n\nbut it‚Äôs hard... i feel so alienated, so alone, and sometimes i feel that no matter how hard i try i will never get out of this rut and i will never matter enough. trying to convince myself that it will be worth it, though. \n\nif any enfp has any advice to share today, i would be so, so grateful. thank you and power to you all!
3	Hang in there. Sounds like you're moving in the right direction. 
1	It seems like feeling alone no matter how hard you try is an ENFP thing, I can definately relate.\n\nHowever I rarely feel like this anymore, and I think it's because I realized at some point that I wanted my friends to be the romantic versions of themselves I viewed them as in my mind. And the romantic versions always hit the right buttons in ways the real versions came short of.\n\nAs many ENFPs I used to hang with different groups of friends in intense periods before being sort of bummed out because I "thought they were more moralistic, intellectual etc"\n\nToday I love my circle of friends, and I have more realistic expectations to people. Different types of people stimulate different sides of me, and I expect no one to be able to push all my right buttons\n\nAlso I've taught my sisters that are probably ENFP that when we have the overwhelming emotions and enthusiasm as we do, we have to make a choice. We can ride that wave out and be absolutely intense but amazing people, but risk a lot of people not inviting you to smaller group events etc because you're simply ALOT everytime people hang around you.  \nOr you learn adapt to people's energy levels, and let your energy out in dosages. I have found relations much more rewarding as I learned not to scare the shit out of people when I'm on a high spike.\n\nI don't know if my situation is similar to yours or if it could be any help, I just thought I'd put it out there in case it might be. :-)\n\nI hope you'll get a good social experience soon where you connect with someone in some way. Sometimes that's all it takes in a tough period.\n\nI wondered also, how come you lost contact with some of your friends after trying to be a better person?\n\nAlways interested in hearing another ENFP tackling life :)
9	How do I get an ENFP engaged in our finances?	INTJ male here. I love the ENFP that is in my life and I work hard every day to be more like her. One of the wedges that persist as we cross into 15+ years of marriage is the topic/engagement of household finances.  I can bring up our situation, prepare/present documents of all assets, accounts, insurance, reports on spending to ensure I'm transparent in what we are doing. She is simply not interested. Not mean or malicious, just not interested. I believe she understands money but simply believes it's not something that should take any time/insight/work to stay on top of compared to other more relational flavored conversations or activities. We have tried splitting finances, envelope system(s), etc., etc., etc., and we always end up back at one joint account where I keep the books and inform her because when fighting about money and marriage, marriage will win every time.\n\nMentality towards money is consistent with other ENFP traits, which is why I post this here.  Maybe I'm wrong.  How do other ENFP's view money, how do you manage it, and what advice do you have for me to see more regular/ongoing engagement from mine?\n\n&#x200B;
7	I have an excel with everything coded using pretty colours, I set it up as a project when I got a new job and have barely looked at it since. As long as I know I'm consistently saving, it's hard to be interested in it. I am generally quite frugal since I lived on scraps for a few years because I refused to take a loan for my living expenses while at uni. I figure it's a good habit to keep.
5	I'm still trying to learn that money doesn't grow in trees! üôÑ üí∏üí∏üí∏
3	Yeah I totally get your wife. My ex always complains my eyes would glaze over whenever finances are brought up. I'm simply not interested. To me, I pay my bills on time, I don't overspend, ok that's it. What a Redditor mention is a gd idea, use colours to entice her. If you use a book, same thing. Add sparkles or stars or cool stickers to decorate the pages. After you guys are fine with your discussion (maybe occasions where it is a heavy weight discussion), go for an ice-cream or do some "fun" thing. I hope this helps! We are generally very young at heart. 
3	We can do it, it just takes a lot of energy and is boring to us. What is it that you‚Äôd like her to do more of?
2	This is a difficult question. I bought a kakebo to write and log my finances, but I haven‚Äôt filled out for January. 
2	i am 100% ENFP, also a CPA, but still struggle to keep my financial house in order - specifically when i‚Äôm under stress. i also spend WAY too much on others or donations during those times. \n\ni don‚Äôt think i‚Äôll ever be CONSISTENTLY great at monitoring but if asked to solve a problem creating a certain tracking method, i‚Äôd be game. then, if told i didn‚Äôt have the ability to monitor it consistently, i‚Äôd be certain to prove\nyou wrong. i tend to be able to accomplish superhuman feats when someone doubts my ability to do so, quite tragic but it is what it is. 
1	Should you?
1	As an ENFP the best I can offer you is to engage them in the planning, hence I set up auto transfers and the like. Repetitive tasking just might be too far. It is for me anyway. 
1	The solution is to divorce her and make her marry an ISFP who (believe it or not) has even less interest in bank accounts and everything that follows. THEN she‚Äôll step up and take charge.\n\nThat‚Äôs how I got engaged with my finances, anyway.
1	This is so me. I‚Äôm an all or nothing type of gal. When my husband (ENTJ) was in the military... I managed our finances and I was really great at it. We saved enough money to buy our first car. Once we started having kids I just wiped my hands of it... he now manages our finances and when he talks about it... it is seriously boring to me. If you find out a great way to get an ENFP interested... I would like to know also... I feel like an asshole when I tune him out about our finances. 
1	I think enfp can be lazy, you know, especially if you already do it for her... its more like a humanity thing. I believe communication is the only only way.. and let her take some responsibility of it. they will never feel the weight of responsibility if you always carry for them. 
50	The Desire to be the Perfect Significant Other	Wondering if this is an ENFP trait:\n\nI'm single at the moment, but feel a strong desire to be the perfect, most attractive guy a girl has had conversation with. Pop-star level physical attractiveness, effortlessly make her laugh or swoon, be able to sing well enough to make her cry, be a well-off self made entrepreneur, and make the world my gift to her.\n\nAnyone else feel a desire to do something similar?
12	What I hear you say is that you want to be loved. And you have made the connection between these traits and being loved. What kind of girl would you attract who is only attracted to those things though? 
11	You just can‚Äôt, you‚Äôll never be. No one can be perfect.\nHowever, you can find someone that thinks you perfectly fit with him/her.
8	Nope. I Just want to be me and be loved that way. People who don't want that can fuck right off.
6	Yes! :D
5	Holy shit, YES. Although I have an avoidant personality so I usually run away before anything can get serious.
3	Nope... lol! (Chill in the calm of togetherness... ;)
2	Nope, and I probably wouldn‚Äôt fall for a guy that was ‚Äúperfect‚Äù either. I‚Äôd rather be with someone authentic ... Selfconfidence shines through and THAT is attractive if you‚Äôre also a good person with a warm heart ‚ù§Ô∏è Swooon ...
2	Yep
2	Me!! Am working on it... It's a lot of pressure and comes from this deep deep fear that if i  am not the most attractive/sexiest/funniest/happy then I will give them a reason to leave. \nThe thing is they already have so many reasons to leave lol, most beyond my control. It's not really rational but it's very deep and embedded and warped by society's messages too. 
1	Sure. And you pull it off with charm and ease. And it works.\nAnd then, about 6 months into the relationship...\n\n*record scratch
1	Yeah, it‚Äôs kind of our idealism talking. And we‚Äôre romantics at heart. Plus we always want to make others happy as much as we want to make ourselves happy. Just remember the reality of things and how sometimes going over the top, you can miss the little things. (I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve watched Netflix‚Äôs sex education. Jackson is very over the top and big romantic gestures but is oblivious to the little things.)
1	Ever heard of manic pixie dream girl? I feel like ENFP‚Äôs can fall into that trap. \nOne thing that sucks and is awesome is that we like to idealize or dream a lot...and then when it actually happens we become disillusioned or disenchanted.\n\nWhat are your thoughts other ENFPs?\n
1	Yes, for sure, that is the strong excitement mechanism we have inside of us. I follow that to the best of my ability but I don't let it affect me too much, because it's fantasy in the end, and while it's useful to attract me to my biggest passion(Excitement is that tool), I don't insist on the outcome that I might get, whether it's anything like what I had imagined or not, and I try to roll with the punches, until I have something more exciting going on. It's hard not to be disappointed sometimes, but this fantasy makes things less real, and more glorious than things really are. The truth is reality sucks sometimes, especially when you believe the things in your head to be better than reality, then it's really hard.\n\nBut the truth is, reality is way way cooler than whatever we have going on in our heads, so I don't let myself get carried away. Atleast I think so.

10	Are ENFP‚Äôs doomed in relationships?	Ok, so I‚Äôll try to keep this as short as possible. I‚Äôm now dating (as far as you can use that word in this case) an ISTP for a year now and I‚Äôm thinks about making an end to this, because sometimes it feels very draining. When we‚Äôre together it feels like my best friend and lover at the same time, but when we‚Äôre not seeing each other, it feels like the love is very one-sided. I don‚Äôt mind he needs his alone time, but if you like each other I think seeing each other once in two weeks at least would be normal.. \n\nWhen I think about previous relationships I start to notice the same pattern: after the ‚Äòhoneymoon‚Äôphase it seems like I‚Äôm the only one who‚Äôs putting energy in it and it makes me wonder why I always seem to attract the same unavailable type of men. \n\nI‚Äôm 31 now, would love to have children in the future, but I don‚Äôt know how to break this pattern. I‚Äôve been reading a lot about enfp‚Äôs and unhealthy relationships and I find it to be true for the most part of it, but IMO once I‚Äôm done with it I‚Äôm really done, even though it may take time before I get to that decision. Are there any enfp‚Äôs out here who have similar experiences? 
11	Dating an ENFP right now and all I can say, it's the energy and vibe I've been looking for for so long. Been in a long term relationship through 17-24 and recently broke up. Believe she was ESTP. As an INFP myself I've never truly felt loved. 'My' current ENFP is amazing in every way. Finally I don't feel like I'm too much/intense for someone. To answer your question: hell no. Where are all ENFPs?! Probably not in my home, behind my desk, wearing my headphones eh? ;)
6	yesss... but it's either i feel like they don't reciprocate my effort and i feel bummed and unloved or i lose interest in them very fast and get sick of them fast
6	I‚Äôm confused. You seem to be saying two things, one being that you put more effort post-honeymoon phase and two that you check out with a finality? As for me no the first and yes to the second. ENFPs are typically the ones the lose interest.\n\nAlso your title is too dramatic.
3	My experience is that Sensor have a bonus to charisma irl, but online they are impossible to chat with. Similarly N are much better online , they get a bonus
3	I have the exact same issue!
2	i have the same issues in relationships. \n\nwe have to stop being giving with expectations it‚Äôs seflish.  \n\ni tend to completely lose myself when i get into a relationship with someone i really like and i focus almost entirely on their needs and they either stop being attracted to me because the independent fun girl they met has turned into some gahell of herself devoted entirely to finding validation from their partner OR we get resentful because we don‚Äôt receive the reciprocal behavior which is really unfair. \n\nbasically, when you are feeling like you are the only one putting work in, put work in by focusing entirely on yourself outside of the relationship (likely what he is doing).  \n\nthere need to be two healthy halves to form a functional whole and we first have to take care of ourselves if we want to succeed in a healthy relationship. 
2	This is exactly what I go through with my relationships as well...Things go absolutely great in the beginning and everything seems alright and then other person just doesn't seem to care like they used to and things mess up.\nBut frankly,if you guys are dating,he should be more willing to meet up often.The moment you sense that disinterest is when you should take cue to have a serious talk with the guy.Such things can't be said openly in friendship where people can easily brand you as a clingy and needy friend.But being in a relationship with him kind of binds the two of you.It automatically becomes your right to voice out your concerns to him when you think he's doing something wrong.It feels like you're spilling your guts out and you are the only one affected by it but you can't keep it inside you for long.Communicating it to him would really help.\nAbout attracting the unavailable type....It's the same for me as well.I spoke to a friend regarding this and here's what he told me - We only accept the love that we think we deserve...\nReflect back on your past relationships,see the pattern and try to understand why you're attracted to and get into relationships with such types.Try and eliminate those who don't care enough and open up your heart to someone who really really does...
1	People are different from us. \n\nAside from general communication,\n\nLearn the love languages on\n\nhow you guys express and receive love... 
1	Yeah, don't say it. Perhaps mention how much you appreciate them. Also, perhaps try to motivate in a positive way instead. Stress the benefits of said activity and how good it will feel. Also perhaps try to participate, I know this really does motivate me, because I don't just do it for me.
1	Dated an INFP and broke up about 4 months ago with the feel of one-sided love was one of the reasons why i  (impulsively) came to the final decision. I kinda regret it but at the same time, I know it was the best for both of us as i was trying too hard to maintain the relationship that i became pretty much a toxic partner, i was not being myself. So i would say that i'm happy because you make up your mind very clear when it come to the final decision, you'll not feel the hurt for too long. But the downside is, imo, ENFPs' thought is affected too much by feelings it becomes very black-and-white and biased in some situations, especially in romatic relationships-when emotions are dominant .\n\nFrom my experience with introverts, this is the very first time i got into a romantic relationship with one. After the breakup, i've spent time looking back in the relationship and reflecting on myself (and even on all of my  previous romantic relationships) EVERYDAY (because i'm still have feelings for him), i found out that i have to have a lot of patience and understanding for my introvert partner and also, on myself or else i'll be just like you, feeling so drained and fall out of love because we don't have enough attention as we expected.\n\nMy tip is lowering down your expectations of attention if you still want to love him as who he is OR having honest, straight forward conversation about your personally situation, what you want in the relationship and what you expect to come out of it (marriage,children,etc.). If he loves you and is mature enough, i believe he'll understand and make compromises with you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\np.s: Sorry for my vocab/grammar mistakes. I'm not a native English user :(
1	Maybe you need to find another ENFP, someone who will put in the energy like you. And too you should make sure they are serious from the start. Ask the serious questions, do they want kids someday? Are they looking fir a serious commitment? How have their past relationships gone and why? These might put off some people but if they are serious about committing they will answer genuinely.
1	What kind of energy? What sorts of things are you doing? What sorts of things is he not doing? In my experience, SPs do what they want, when they want to so if you want to be with them, you have to sacrifice an expectation that they will be on your wavelength all the time. I love them, so I‚Äôm willing to find other things to occupy my time. \n\nBut...less than once every two weeks does seem a bit extreme. How far away do you live from each other? Have you talked to him about it? What makes you think you attract unavailable men?
1	It's a balancing game. The natural state of the relationship between you two is somewhere you are uncomfortable with. You can't force someone to be more affectionate to you, it'll work oppositely. Accept the real relationship between you two, negotiate better terms, or find someone new

3	Lol good job I like itüëåüèª
1	I passed almost all my university exams (24 in total) by studying ALL the books during the weekend (an average of 5 books, 1000 pages in total). And I passed all of them.\nSo yes, I relate to this :-)
3	easy for people to be rude to me	so i've been noticing that some of my friends have been okay with talking to me rudely now (i'm a very sarcastic person but the way they say it def ain't sarcasm). rudely as in insensitive and just... unnecessarily mean?\n\nthere's this one friend who doesn't like me (she gossips abt me to others), but instead of confronting her idk why but i'm super cautious and cordial to her now. (as an ENFP i hate confrontation) so now she finds it easy to talk down to me because she thinks i'm being naiive and an easy target. \n\nthat's bad but at least i don't have attachment to her so i just brush it off. but now my close friend has started doing that too.\n\nshe's an INFP and she's pretty emotional. when she's not in the mood she'll be openly very snappy. today we met up for a grp project and i got lost so i took 5 mins longer to get there. i suggested place A to eat, she said ok. then when she was already at the place she was like wait, how about place B? (the food at place B is v bad too me) so i said it's ok let's just eat at place A. she messed up her order and i was laughing jokingly (like teasing) then she said 'stop or i'll push your wound' (i injured myself a few days before). that kinda alr put me off and throughout the day she was just kinda annoyed. our other friend bought her smth to eat as a present, and she asked us if we wanted to share it with her then. we told her she cld just bring it back home and we didn't want to eat it, but she said 'just shut your mouth', and insisted to eat it then and there. \n\nhonestly i find it really rude because i've always been so accommodating but she has let me down so many times. but i don't want to confront her abt it but im afraid my grudge will build up till i break. what shld i do?
4	Hey this started happening to me too! The confrontation side of it sucks but we HAVE to call people out on it or they‚Äôll assume they can get away with it. Make them uncomfortable with an upfront, ‚Äòhey, I don‚Äôt find this funny. I‚Äôm not comfortable with it, stop.‚Äô If they don‚Äôt stop they‚Äôre likely a shit person and not worth your time.\n\nAlso she generally sounds like a dick, drop the bitch ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I find if someone isn‚Äôt nice to me why on earth would I want them around? They just bring you down and I ain‚Äôt got time for that.
2	"there's this one friend who doesn't like me"\n\nThat's not a friend. And your INFP one doesn't sound like a friend either. These are just toxic, negative people that might have been friends before but clearly no longer. Drop the dead weight and find positivity in your life.
1	That gossipy chick doesn't seem like a friend at all. People like that aren't worth your time and will always just want to find a way to put you down. Just don't deal with her at all. In my past I was just surface level nice to avoid confrontation but internally just completely uncaring and distanced.\n\nThe INFP seems to be annoyed from the very start and there is probly nothing you can have done better. There is not much one can do in these situations other than letting them know how they make you feel and try to work it out and/or find yourself friends who respect you and like you for the amazing person you are.
1	Your lack of capitalization and abbreviations are interesting. Just communicate with her. This is your practice time before you have to do it as a real adult with real consequences.\n\nAlso your title says ‚Äúpeople,‚Äù implying some kind of pattern of behavior on your part. So maybe reflect on that a little more...
54	ENFP nightmare	I'm an enfp (triple-checked and confirmed) and I find life too hard most of the time. :-/ I wish so much I was something else, at least sensing instead of intuitive... \nI can't do "normal" people jobs because then my anxiety and depression gets much worse (i tried for 7 years, it didn't _work_ out :p)... but I don't have a degree or ability to study (due to severe ADD/ADHD) to try get a better job. People don't need my touchy-feely bullshit, all they want is logical, structured robots, who can handle anything. \nI had the worst time in school as a kid, always made feel inferior to others. But we had no access to proper healthcare, so I never had help. I must have had severe ADD, nothing else could explain such inability to concentrate on school.\n\nThe only silver lining is my friends, who are awesome and like me as I am, but friends are not a paid job.\n\nI don't know what to do with myself. I cannot get focused enough to achieve anything :( \n\n\n\n\n
32	Get into stuff where caring is needed. I was an children English/fitness instructor for the last 5 month in Tokyo and it was the first time I was motivated to bet up in the morning and head to work. The workdays went by super fast and I could just be my normal happy enthusiastic and caring self. Actually it helped me be great at the job . \n\nI only worked for 3 days a week though and can't afford Tokyo this way. So I'll head back to Germany where I can easily live off a 3 day office job. \nWork itself is boring and I don't like it. But the coworkers and my boss are great and I can handle 3 shirty days if I get 4 free days afterwards. \n\nJust an inspiration to follow your heart and try to play on your strengths. \n\nIt's much harder for us ENFPs in normal jobs compared to most other types. 
30	Hey! I am 27 years old ENFP and I currently am working as a data scientist in the financial corporate world soon to be switching into data science for management consulting next month. You can very well say that I am one of the many robots currently existing in this sensor driven world hahaha.\n\nWhen I was younger, I always attributed my inability to organize or my inability to form structured ideas as part of my ENFP personality. But although that is true, it subconsciously puts the notion in me that these flaws cannot be fixed since they are core characteristics of the ENFP stereotype. When I realized that my personality is more than 4 letters, I began adopting another approach that helped me become more productive with my personal growth.\n\nI am the type of person to want to face so much failure because at least I'll learn from them. So I let myself fail all the time, trying to gain lessons to be learned about who I am. I remembered that the first time I wrote my maths research paper, it was poor and academically unprofessional due to my poor thought structure, but my advisor did a great job at guiding me how to think structurally while I let my visual intuition continually flirt with the research problem. It eventually became a successfully published paper and even won a speaking award due to what I have learned in that process!\n\nI found that continually facing your weaknesses as opportunities to learn and grow helped me a ton to seek for my happiness. Sure, maybe the world expects deadlines at some date, but don't let those deadlines determine your worth. Let yourself fail in meeting those deadlines to experience the weaknesses you hold so that you can grow. It's tough but it really helps.\n\nLet me know if you need more help! I'd be happy to listen :)
13	You sound just like me. I coasted through school doing the bare minimum. I got my degree even though it was a struggle but realised I couldn't work a normal job so left my career office job for freelance writing while travelling and now have a few passive income streams allowing me to do what I want with my time (which is a struggle in itself). \n\nYou will get there man just find something you enjoy and figure out how you can turn it into a business. 
5	I don't know your age but you seem very young (maybe early 20-something?).\n\nWhat I can say is: just don't take you down, ENFPs have several strenghts that others lack or even miss (that's why we're usually appreciated by other types), you should focus on them, not on the ones you haven't. This is mainly a life lesson, rather than an MBTI thing.\nSchool results? I don't care too much. In some other comment in this sub I mentioned that I have a sociology degree but I work as a software engineer. What I didn't mention is that I always been a _terrible student_, but that didn't stopped me to find my way (not to mention that many of the brillant students I knew, didn't find a better job, or had other brillant results in their lives).\nAlso, try to figure out the causes of your depression and solve them. Forget for one moment about ADD/ADHD, go your way toward what could make you feel realized. Putting passion into something will help you for sure.\n\nMy 2 cents
5	After struggling for several years not fitting into society and getting fired from all companies due to "inappropriate   \n and jeer behavior" for not obeying strict rules, I had to accept that I am not the robotic slave type of person who can do "normal" jobs. Not even close, I felt excluded my whole life, for this and for many other reason which led to depression and social anxiety. I graduated and wanted to be a teacher to serve higher goods but couldn't start Masters degree to continue. Then I found yoga. After my first class I immediately felt "this is the thing I want to do all my life" and so it is now, I am a full-time yoga teacher, though I just started and I have difficulties to find enough clients but it's the part of the process. Yoga is really good for all kind of anxiety, frustration, silences the mind (which is the real deal for ADD/ADHD ppl) and treats your lack of confidence/self-esteem.  \n It makes me feel good that I found a vocation where I can help, be productive and do real good to people. I still participate in the community and I'm a (if not the MOST) useful part of society. My partner does the money-making work for both of us, he's the type of person who can do it, so he offered me the precious gift to concentrate on my path and nothing else and I can't be grateful enough for it. Sometimes I wish it would be different so I could make a lot of money, but my mental and spiritual health worth way more than being "normal".\n\nI am pretty sure there are things that you are passionate about. Find your passion and follow it. Your friends will help you though rough time. Find something that you do with love and enthusiasm and make a business out of it. Brainstorming also helps, gather your tribe and try to find out something that fits you entirely. Take care of people, serve higher goods, educate yourself and concentrate on one thing at time. Mostly, concentrate on one thing at time.  \n
4	While I have a lot of the same problems as an ENFP, I think we must also acknowledge the fact that this capitalistic society is not healthy for people overall. That said, I am here in this society and need to function within it, I must play along with their rules to some degree. And that might mean being bored in a normal job OR finding an abnormal job that allows for more freedom (freelancing). \n\nI don't believe that I can only do a job that i'm passionate about or is my "true calling". After practice, I can stick to a job, make money to live, and I'm proud of that.\n\nConcentration is a skill that can be practiced. Try finding a free/low cost clinic to get treatment for ADD. Also, cutting out caffeine and sugar help. Setting up a routine or schedule is key. If you can't follow a schedule every day, at least schedule a weekly activity to begin. Something like yoga, meditation, martial arts, or a class once a week builds up the discipline and memory of having a routine. I started off with part-time restaurant or grocery store jobs (coworkers are friendly, you move around and talk to people), just to build up my confidence and practice being on time and committing to 3-6 months to a job. Then build from there.\n\nI don't think there's a secret to having concentration, or a secret "perfect" job for ENFPs, or that a personality type dooms you forever to only being able to have act in one way. Our preferences and thoughts don't have to be our behaviors. Also, letting go of what we "should have" achieved or expectations compared to other people is very freeing.\n\nTLDR: society sucks, but you have to function in it. Treat the issues that are holding you back, then start practicing slow and small to build up your concentration and skills.

2	I get this ENFP dilemma 100000%! \n\nAs far as my work experience, I‚Äôve worked mostly as a nanny, as I felt the freedom to be myself. Nannying doesn‚Äôt pay super well, though, and there‚Äôs a cap to it unless I were to nanny and spend my life devoted to a wealthy family in NY or CA. \n\nMy goal was to never compromise my soul in a job. I‚Äôve pursued everything I really love and enjoy instead.\n\nI‚Äôve done massage therapy. \nI could teach dance, if I really wanted.\nI learned how to be a dog trainer, which I could charge for, as my dog knows hundreds of commands and various tricks. \nI housesit, dog walk, and pet sit. \n\nCurrently, a recent venture that began 2 years ago, is that I‚Äôm a phone only dominatrix and dominate and deeply listen to men on the internet. It‚Äôs, by far, the most profitable and required the most learning curve. I‚Äôve got nothing but 5 star reviews since I began. Basically, my knowledge of human nature, natural curiosity, psychology, and the psyche work to my advantage, plus my skills of creativity and storytelling interplay. ;)\n\nOnce I began to realize how easy it was for me to make money online, I‚Äôve actually stopped working a bit to center myself into being led by my heart, doing things that purely fulfill me, not merely led by financial gain.\n\nRecently, I applied to graduate school to be a licensed marriage and family therapist. I have learned a lot with my dominatrix ventures and understand many aspects of kink; I would like to help clients within a different avenue. \n\nI‚Äôm a strange one. And I love me. \n\nUs ENFPs have a profound ability to connect with others interpersonally. Be yourself and do what your heart says. Believe in yourself and in your empathetic nature as a strength, not as a weakness. Be true to your values. It doesn‚Äôt matter where you ‚Äúwork,‚Äù but be true to your heart wherever you go. Life is short!
2	And now begins the journey to love yourself, exactly as you are, without feeling the need to change one single thing. Cheri Huber's book "There is Nothing Wrong with You" really helps in this regard, and so does looking up Highly Sensitive People, or HSPs. Best of luck to you! :)
2	I agree with this very much so. I'm very sorry you're going through it right now. I was 3 years through my bachelors of psychology when I quit school after getting a full time job at the grocery store I was working at. The money was enough to get by but I absolutely loved working, being on my feet, making produce beautiful and now I'm going to be an assistant store manager with the same company. You just have to find your niche. I find that most ENFPs work better with their hands or anything that keeps them moving and less space to over think. \n\nIt may take some time, but you'll get there buddy. \nGood luck! 
2	>all they want is logical, structured robots\n\nI wish. If you're a robot at a workplace, expect to get canned the moment someone gets in a huff about how you're not spending all your time socializing with them and giving them the attention they obviously deserve, but instead have the temerity to actually *work* instead of being their personal chew toy.
2	Without the awesomeness that are my coworkers, I think that I would find my job much less fulfilling, so don't feel bad.
3	I feel you. I've had 4 completely different jobs in the last 4 years and I got bored/sick of them all. Currently trying out freelancing but I haven't found much work doing that so far... hopefully it'll come with more time and effort. I feel like modern society is shaped for a few types of people (the structured robots) and it's definitely not shaped for people like us (touchy-feely). \n\nThe thought of getting another office job and having to leave my apartment at 8am and spend an hour dealing with the commute and public transit and then getting home at 7pm and you have to deal with groceries and making food and going to the gym and then by the time you're done with it all it's 10pm and you have to go to bed and re-start the cycle 4 more times every week. Like what the fuck, that shit sucks so bad. After a few months at a new job, once the 'new excitement' wears off I get depressed. But what else can you do? It's 'the way the world currently works' and I hate everything about it. Why can't we just be and enjoy this precious time we have? Any 'modern society' shouldn't have to function like this imo. \n\nI know I'm just ranting and not really offering any advice whatsoever but I just want to let you know where I'm at and hopefully that makes you feel a bit better. Yes there are jobs you can find that you might enjoy, I have a degree in digital art and have worked in graphic design/3d stuff. I did enjoy it at first but what ended up happening though is that I've begun resenting being creative and artistic because I had to do it all the time for work and not 'for me'. \n\nThere was ONE job I had (scuba instructor) right out of college for a few months that I really enjoyed, teaching people and helping them discover a new world made me feel happy. The only issue is that it would be considered one of those 'fun jobs' and not a 'real career'. The money wasn't good but the lifestyle was amazing (albeit unsustainable for me). /endrant haha \n\nFeel free to DM if you ever wanna chat and good luck out there!
1	Hi, I'm a fellow ENFP struggling through nursing school right now. After 2 years figuring out how to navigate the mental health system, I finally got back my diagnoses for ADHD, PTSD, OCD and severe generalized anxiety. You're not alone. I frequently find myself stunned and amazed how people seem to go about their days in the ways that they do with no issues. The thought of living the way most of people do for the rest of my life, without long stretches of time to take walks in the park and talk to my friends, makes me want to kill myself. On top of my diagnoses, one of the things my psychologist mentioned is that I'm a highly sensitive person, which is considered normal as 20-30% of the population is. But on top of everything else, it makes everyday life practically unbearable. I can't deal with the noise, the crowds, the air pollution, the insensitivity, stupidity and selfishness of the average person. I don't want to claim being some kind of a moral paragon or anything, on the contrary I realize I'm a very weak person. But after my last dose of magic mushrooms as a desperate attempt to self-medicate, something related to either that or the medication I take for my ADHD has made it so the texture of meat is extremely unappealing to me. Literally makes me sick to my stomach. So I've gone about 90% vegetarian without even really thinking about it.\n\nOn top of all that I've been thinking about getting my tubes tied a lot recently. I don't want to hurt myself or anybody else but the thought of adding more suffering to this world is unbearable to me.\n\nSo you're hardly alone OP. There is a great deal of suffering in this world that, for some reason, some of us are just not able to ignore.
1	Well, I'd start by strongly advising that you seek out a low cost therapist to help you work through some of this. I'm not sure where you live, but most major cities either have programs that you can get into or therapists that work on sliding scales based on income. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a fellow ADD sufferer and ENFP, I can tell you that you have to have a really solid toolbox of things that can help keep you on track. Having ADD doesn't mean you are incapable of focusing, it just means you have a real hard time focusing on things that don't stimulate you. You've got to lean tricks to keep yourself a little more focused when things are boring and how to take advantage of the things that do interest you and tap into our superpower better known as hyper focus. Sometimes medication can help and sometimes not. I feel like that's a really personally decision, but also something well worth discussing with a therapist.     \n\n&#x200B;\n\n 
3	Bi Polar and ENFP	Okay, so hear me out.\n\nI'm an ENFP, but also have bi polar II disorder. I've read a lot of posts here and naturally, over in the bi polar subreddit.\n\nThere seem to be a lot of similar posts on each subreddit regarding certain behaviors in personal and professional lives and I was wondering if maybe the two are somehow connected? Not saying ALL ENFPs have bi polar or ALL bi polar people are ENFPs.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is there a general connection to mental illness, bi polar specifically, and ENFP? \n\nEdit - personal note: I think I'm making the correlation based on my own behavior which has me wondering do I act *this* way because I'm bi polar? or do I act *that* way  because my personality type is ENFP. Understandably both and all personality types and mental disorders differ from person to person but I heavily relate to both groups and noticed how similar both behaviors are with others and myself.\n\nAlso, I'm not saying you all have a mental disorder, haha. (Just in case)
8	As a *very* quick analysis, I would say the connection is between the hypomanic episodes and when an ENFP gets exceptionally excited about a new passion project, as well as the depressive episodes and when an ENFP is spending too much time alone, has not had sufficient time to process if new experiences/circumstances align with values, or has recognized that something in their life is not aligning with their values.\n\nThat said, I‚Äôd be careful with pathologizing any MBTI type, as the types are all strengths-based. It‚Äôs two completely different forms of evaluation. Though it would be interesting to look at certain types and the correlation with certain disorders. For example, I can imagine that INTJ‚Äôs and ISTJ‚Äôs might be particularly inclined toward obsessive compulsive disorders.\n\nFascinating thought!
2	Interesting!\n\nPeople tend to make connections between ADD and ENxPs but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve heard bipolar and ENFP. Manic behaviors and Ne-dom (or Se-dom) behaviors could have some correlations, perhaps\n\nBoth of the people that I know who have been diagnosed as bipolar are cognitively introverted, I think. If I had to guess, I‚Äôd say ISFJ and some sort of IxFP. I‚Äôve also spoken to a bipolar INTJ\n\nI‚Äôm interested in hearing other people weigh in on this
78	INTJ falling for ENFP friend	Im 18M INTJ, my 18F ENFP and I are friends for 4 years, our relationship started to be more intense earlier this year, we chat every single day, we talk about everything, we even talked about my now ex-gf, her ex-crush and how I'm doing with girls and dating, when she told me that she had a crush on one of my buddies, I (as a good "friend") tried to make it happen between them but now she's not interested in him anymore (We did go to a "friendly date" me and her during this period). Recently I think I started falling in love, with how of an amazing and wonderfull person she is, she understand me and know how to talk to me, I noticed that she (I guess) drops a lot of hints like "I would love to have an INTJ boyfriend" or when Im angry or tired she would go like "come to me I know how to calm you" and more stuff like that. Im kind of obsessed, I hate when my mind is uncleare. I dont wanna tell her because it suerly would ruin our friendship.\n\nHelp me out ENFPs.
56	THIS IS SO PRECIOUS üò∞\n\nI think you should start doing like more boyfriend things.  pick her up spontaneously and take her places, stuff like that. we like spontaneity and we typically start thinking of someone in a romantic light on our own. what i mean by that is *if we know someone likes us before we‚Äôve developed feelings for them, it‚Äôs less likely for us to develop feelings afterward*. we enjoy the chase. throw in a complement every once in a while but use them sparingly. 
19	Just go for it man, do what feels right
17	As an ENFP myself I would give you the following advice. \n\n1. Go for it. But be smooth . Build it up show signs of interest and keep building up. Start with small gestures like compliments , touching her arm etc. See how she responds . And if she likes it or reciprocates you can give even clearer signs and make bolder moves. But don't just straight up say what's going on. She will now it and will love the natural flow. At some point it will naturally escalate. \n\nAlso give her room. After giving signs and so on. Give her time to think and feel about it. Don't be the first to start interactions or texting. She will naturally move things forward if it is meant to be. Romance is always two sided.\n\n2. Even if it doesn't work out that usually wouldn't keep us ENFPs from having a deep friendship. As long as you are being cool about it we can handle it. And who knows her values might change and she'll like you later on.  
15	woo\~\~\~\~ take her on another date, mate!!! 
13	Thanks everyone, I took notes of everything, gonna keep you guys updated.
3	My fianc√© is an INTJ.\nIn highschool he would always listen to me and be there, give insightful advice, we‚Äôd always go on adventures and such. \n Something that I always loved was how insightful and logical my INTJ is, yet he still showed interest in my scattered brain. I think showing her that you will be there, showing you care about her interest and her emotions will help you a lot. \nYou should also ask on r/INTJ there are a lot of people over there who end up with ENFPS which is funny because it‚Äôs like yin and yang \nGood luck friend ! Wish you the best 
5	**DO IT**
2	Tell her. You won't ruin anything. If she likes you, it'll be great. If she doesn't then she won't cut you out. You'll just have to manage your own potential hurt feelings. We don't cut people out. We have no "door slam."\n\nThat's my initial reaction anyway. For me, if I like you I'll tell you. I hate uncertainty. Also if you like her, she probably already knows. We can read people pretty well. Idk about female ENFP attitudes, and idk how emotionally healthy she is, but I imagine she's just waiting for you to show some cajones and make a move. 
2	I dont agree with the people saying you should do more "friendly " stuff with her.  That is just circle-jerking to me.  Be upfront about your feelings and tell her you want to take her on a date.  You are obviously scared of losing her as a friend. That is natural, I would be too- she is clearly a great friend. But you can make sure she knows that you still want to remain friends if and in case she isn't interested in pursuing a relationship (not likely, but still).  If she's truly your friend, she would not throw away a deep friendship just because you asked her on a date (preposterous). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou could tell her something like (in private obviously). "I want to tell you something really important. Lately, I am having a lot of strong feeligns for you. I like you as a person and I love talkign and spending time with you etc etc .  I would like it we went on a date.  Its fine if you dont want to , I really value you as a friend and I dont want anything ruining that " and so on.   Hope you kids figure it out
2	My INTJ husband and I connected over a mutual interest in relationships having meaning. He was and is a fascinating mystery to me. I help him explore life and appreciate the small details on the way. It's pretty awesome, although it's also VERY hard sometimes. However, it's important to note it was never hard while we were still dating. I dated him from age 16, got married at 19, never looked back. And while we dated, the newness of it all was like being on an emotional high for 3 years. Marriage was like actually a building a home to live in together--exciting, challenging, sometimes tough, sometimes painful, intensely rewarding, occasionally cute, and a grand adventure. \n\nI guess what I'm saying is I'm a fan. :) \n\nI think you should go for it in your own wonderful way. Don't worry about playing her personality game, just start being more open than you've ever been, however you're able to do so. Trust me, if she is a classic ENFP, she will not REST until she has found every mystery. And if she's willing to do that, she's probably into you. :) 
2	She‚Äôs dropping hints about how she knows you, wants to be with you, cares about you... effortlessly and naturally. She adores you. Adores. You. Yes, you.\nWelcome to the dream-come-true reality of being loved, known, and unconditionally adored by an ENFP.\nDo both of you a favour: stop thinking (you INTJ, you!) and start acting. Adore her back. And remember: actions *always* speak louder than words. So happy for you both ‚ô•Ô∏è Take it to adoration level. No more of this friendly stuff. Happily Ever After. The End.
1	My friend.... 9/10 People that made the move didnt lose, but Just in case you lose its not the end, you are types that are calm and grown up, she would understand your feelings... If she liked you(90%) then guess what ;), elseway she Will still care about you and try to find a way to coexist. She wont leave you. Now if yourself would be the problem, as time passes interests change so she wont be the ONE forever, exept if you fall to this thing... DUH! My point is DO IT you wont ruin anything.... From the mind of another enfp(that sorts by NEW) 
4	so many opportunities but i'm now allowed to use them	(I didn't find a button to edit the title but there is "not" instead of "now")\n\nHey to everyone\n\nI don't know why I'm writing this maybe because no one really understands how bad I feel with all this situation.\n\nI'm very tired of living the way I live. I'm on my vacations now and I am so bored. There are two days left to my University and it's so hard for me to wait.\nFrom my childhood I can't stand  times when I do nothing. And the thing that I hate the most that I know that there are so much I can do BUT my grandparents (I live with them) just restrict me in all and I just quarrel with them all the time because of that.\n\nI'm 18 years old and they don't allow me to come home later than 7 p.m. So imagine how do I feel when I'm hanging out with my friends and then they continue having fun and I just have to go home where I feel so alone and depressed again. I even started crying after I wrote this passage.\n\nI have the ukulele which I love playing and also I want to learn to cook something very much, I like learning new things but there is also a problem here. I can't play and sing as loud and as long as I want when my granparents at home (and they're 95% of time at home) and if I try to do something on the kitchen it's always a lot of questions and everything which I just hate and we argue again. I just hate the fact that they're always "we want to do the best for you" but EXACTLY I know what is the best for me and they just make my life much more worse.\n\nThere is another flat not far from this house where I come sometimes to just be alone and do the things I want but they just call me and say "When did you come home????" and it's again I can't return back later than 7 p.m. and I have another boring evening. I want to move there so much but it has to be repaired first and I'm not sure thay my grandparents will allow me to move there because "you're still the child". But I know that there I would be the happiest person in the world because different activities and friends (who I would be able to hang out more and invite to sleepover or go to their houses at night) make me so happy. I can't even start to do sport in the University because the one that I want is on the evening and I will not be allowed to do it because "it's too late".\n\nI just can't stand this anymore. I hate that there are so many things that I can do but I'm just not allowed to do it because of my relatives without any particular reason. I can't stand now a thought that YEAH TOMORROW I WILL MEET MY FRIEND I'M SO HAPPY but I have to return home by 7 p.m. It's killing me. And right now I can't communicate with my relatives again because I'm so angry and also want to cry.
7	Yeah, my parents tried to act like yours. Well, they failed.\n\nDo what you think/feel, explain your reasons. If they don't understand, do it anyway. Just be sure you aren't doing something really stupid or wrong ;-)
1	Instead of trying to be ubderstood try to understand, the solution Will be in front of you. There is a factor you maybe might not be calculating, the dramatic experiences of the past.I hope they are not something special an they are Just stuborn. But on the other case you could really ask them WHY? but calmly... Why 7a.m?,my energy fuels are going to waste, why not be able to do anything for myself(thats personal, needs time e. T. C) ? Have you never been annoying yo your parents\n? Why Cant you stand stand some noice so im able to train myself?, this hopefully Will fix things from your percpective and remember that no matter how Hard things get, balance Will happen again and its not a shame to cry, make sure to speak with a friend for the progress you make. If nothing of these helps.. Well you shall be free soon since you are 18.make sure to live in a house with university student neighbours that never sleep xD
5	How to spot an INFJ	Hi ENFP here (25M).\nI am wondering how to spot INFJs? I always bond with INFPs, but I want to know where and how to spot an INFJ?\n\nI sound like I am playing Pok√©mon Go or something:\nCoffee shops, bookstores? Idk. Help please? \n\nWhat are some characteristics? 
10	Look for people that look like INTJs but with warm eyes and a normal clothing style
10	As an enfp, I‚Äôve noticed that infj‚Äôs have thicker ice to break initially. They don‚Äôt often reveal their emotions right away, even though us enfp‚Äôs are pretty good at helping people open up.\nIn my opinion, it‚Äôs usually that an infj chick that will shyly pursue you because of your enthusiasm and charm, but if you don‚Äôt have awareness you might miss it 
9	Scan the room for people that are reserved normally but as soon as they see some injustice or even someone sad/cryinh they won't shut up, usually with a book in hand, or headphones in ears to avoid humanity, also look for people that while you're taking actually listen to you, are 100% just focused on you and usually end up mimicking your actions and once you're done taking if you realise they revealed absolutely nothing about themselves, they're probably an INFJ 
3	People who don‚Äôt talk and shy away from groups are usually INFJ and they look like they‚Äôd rather not be there. Screaming inside because of all the socializing that could happen to them at any moment. They watch the crowds and enjoy the energy from afar. Lol then you talk to them and they‚Äôre nice as hell. 
3	All the INFJs I know are super under-the-radar and have resting bitch faces, but are actually super nice. They will gladly engage you if you are weird and talk about something outlandish. May be snarky and witty.
3	They are incredibly self-aware, conversational, intelligent and funny. If they don‚Äôt feel appreciated they will become reserved. I know 4. They are wonderful. One is a nurse, one is an engineer, one is a teacher, one works in aged care. 
2	Many INFJs type out as Enneagram 4s which can also provide you with another source of clues: [https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-4/](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-4/) 
2	ask in infj subreddit and probably reveal your current location ,see if there is any one around your area , good luck!!!
2	Resting bitch face\n\nAppears very confident, but is actually shy in conversation\n\nKind hearted\n\nCan't do small talk, loves anything weird or profound\n\nWill likely ask you more questions at first and avoid giving much about themselves away
1	They are some of the most emotionally sensitive, and as a result you won't usually find them out and about trying to soak up all of the attention. Try to make friends from your current friends, or look for groups filled with people having hobbies. \n\nI have 2 best friend INFJs each on the other side of the world and they're awesome! Definitely slow to break the ice but now it's like a solid forever bro bond. 
1	I‚Äôm the quiet kid who watches people and seems mean but is always willing to help and talk. If you think someone is one just talk to us we actually would love it
29	Need for validation	How do I quench my thirst when in comes to needing validation? I need to be acknowledged, heard and feel accepted or else I'm just going to feel down. I need other people to give me validation or I'm gonna feel bad. It feels like every interaction I have to put on a performance and put on a mask, but I want to be myself without having my guard so high that I can't even recognize who I am and what I stand for. I don't want to feel bad everytime my conversation doesn't go perfectly, I don't want to isolate myself all the time, I want a way out. How?
9	I found I grew out of needing constant validation as I got older. Just being able to rely on myself a little better for validation instead of needing it from other people. I still catch myself frequently. I just try to take a breath and hold space for myself in those moments and pause my reaction until I dig a little deeper. \n\nAs an example: Recently, my mom told me about a joke my grandma said about me and it threw me into an absolute TAILSPIN. At first I was annoyed with them for saying things behind my back that weren't 1000% glowing, then at my mom for having a big mouth, then at my grandma for being an old fuddy-duddy, then I finally realized that my reaction to this was 100% my responsibility, and tried to work through why exactly I needed validation. Then back to being annoyed by my grandma for saying that then being annoyed with myself for being knocked off balance so easily by things like that. I ended up still feeling insecure and didn't really discover the \~exact\~ reason I was so thrown off by the interaction, but I ended up deciding that neither of them meant any harm and I can choose to let it go (doing a great job with the second part, lol). \n\nBasically, I just try to hold space for myself and ask why I'm affected by this and how can I be strong enough to not have \~whatever thing\~ throw off my balance. 
5	I find that journalling is helpful when you're craving attention. Writing down affirmations or even saying them aloud until I at least half heartedly believe can calm my nerves.\n\nAlso sitting with myself and thinking: \n\nWhat do I want to humble brag about rn?\nWhat do I want to gush about?\nWhat have I had to overcome to be here?\nWho can I count on/ who do I know loves me?\nDo I just want to vent or hear "crap, that really sucks"\nIs there a specific person you feel you aren't impressing enough/disappointing/not being heard by? \n\nI talk to myself about things that are weighing on me.\nSometimes out loud, sometimes on paper.\n\nI also tell myself that I'm strong, I'm beautiful, I'm loving and deserving of love, I can do whatever I put my mind to, ect.\n\nBeing a good friend to yourself
6	Man, you guys are such nice people man. I'm typed as an ENFP and I can resonate to it to an extent . When I first got typed that way I realized that this was happening to me. \n\nBut now I just don't give a shit, stop trying to hold it all together to keep up an appearance. If you're fucked just accept the reality and work out of it. \n\nOther's approval or validation doesn't mean shit , if you're happy and successful that will come automatically. But seeking validation and getting it is not going to give you happiness or success. \n\nSo stop giving too much of a shit, help those who REALLY need help, don't be so sensitive. There are way worser people out there than you . Oh and you're not a Saint or an Angel remember that, we're humans we fuck up, we learn. So learn to forgive yourself instead of running around to ask others for their opinions and solutions on your perceived moral dilemmas .\n\nYou only seek validation when you inherently believe there is something wrong with you, there is nothing wrong with you. With any of you . \n\nThere are psychopaths blowing up shit and murdering people, raping children and lots of other sick shit. They're the ones who are fucked up. They are the ones who have something pathologically wrong with them.
3	Omg me too, I always know I do bu I've never been able to put it into words so well like you did. I always doubt if the person I think I am is really who I am, since people naturally think better of themselves. I hate myself for always sort of acting so much but I can't stop. I don't seem to know how to express myself any other way 
2	Maybe give yourself validation? Tell yourself you did great on XYZ because ABC. \n\nAlso try meditating. Connect with yourself so you don't need to feel complete from another person. \n\nAlso, just communicate your needs to others. I wish for my ex I had told her to give me more praise and less criticism. If your friends/partner truly cares they'll adjust to help you feel loved. 
2	I tend to say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs so me a lot‚Äù but this is probably the most ‚Äúme‚Äù thing I‚Äôve ever read. Could‚Äôve easily written it myself.
9	Trying a New thing.	So I know as an ENFP trying a new thing isn't in itself a new thing, the hard part is keeping at the said new thing.\n\nI'll have you know I restarted this post about 10 times to try to have this come out as I want it to haha, I start a sentence and then I am like, they need context for this haha.\n\nAnyway, so recently I have been trying to follow a routine I created for myself. In the beginning, I was really good about it, but over time I started to get tired of it and now have just outright stopped doing it. Which isn't good, but so common with us, and with me as well. Its almost as if having a routine mentally and physically drains you which it should be the opposite.\n\nI have been feeling also pretty down about not following through with the said routine as the tasks are important for my wellbeing and such, things like meditation, working out, setting time to learn a new skill, or refine an old one, Write, etc.\n\nSo I have been trying to figure out a way to do better. As ENFP's I am sure you can relate to this feeling, and the fact that we are so open-minded and think of a million things that its hard to focus, although it's not the act of focusing is the problem, I am pretty decent at it. My problem is having the passion and will to actually ACT on the task I am supposed to be focusing on haha.\n\nAnyway, I thought since the issue is possibly the fact that its a routine and not the tasks themselves I am going to test out a possible solution.\n\nThe solution possibly is to have a randomized todo list, things you want to get done but maybe not in the same order every single day, that way maybe it won't get boring. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo test this I am planning on utilizing Trello to create categories and then tasks in those categories such as: Personal/Meditate. and then in the morning I will go to the [random.org](https://random.org) website and randomize the tasks and then see how we do. Although I wonder if the fact of waking up to randomize the thing in itself would be a routine that I will get tired of soon enough, but for now its what I can think of until maybe a better solution, maybe one that knows my needs and wishes and automatically randomizes them and then shares them to me when I wake up.. I dunno haha\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTrying to try new things to maybe help, cause I feel so bad and kind of depressed that I was doing so well to now not feeling up to the task anymore haha.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWish me luck, I'll update if wanted or maybe tell me what you guys have done to be more productive? Or maybe that I thought of a great idea haha whichever haha.
2	If I come up with a project myself, it‚Äôs pretty hard (if not impossible) for me to follow through. What helps me, however, is a set agenda and pressure from above, e. g. school and work tasks where you can expect negative consequences in case you don‚Äôt do them properly. Another thing helping me is other people watching, as in sports for example (for me, it is way easier to get to my limits in sports when I‚Äôm training with a team as opposed to doing sports at home. \n\nMy advice would be that you tell some ‚Äúorganized‚Äù people about your project and make sure they make you engage in it, e.g. by setting you a deadline or by checking the status of your work. Their task is to apply some mental pressure (and threatening you with consequences (the severity of the consequences should be equivalent to the projects worth)) onto you.\n\nI know it sounds evil, but for me this is something that helped me a lot in the past. \nAnd also, if you follow through, you will eventually reach a point where you don‚Äôt want to give up anymore, regarding the amount of work you put in that would be for nothing in that case.\n\nGood Luck üçÄ, I know you can do this 
2	If I need to do something I don't like, it always motivates me to think future me will be very thankful that he won't have to do it anymore
69	Advocating	If we are the cheerleaders for everyone, how come we need cheerleaders too? There isn‚Äôt an endless pool of happiness we take from, we struggle just like everyone else. \n\nYet, because we can be so objective and give genuine advice, people think we have our shit together. It‚Äôs like being a doctor who is terminally ill. We can fix everyone else, but when another doctor comes in to tell US what‚Äôs wrong, we analyze, judge, fight back like we know just as much as them, if not MORE. \n\nArg. I love being an advocate, I hate never being advocated for tho 
36	We need it because we are human. When someone praises someone else for their qualities and accomplishments, they feel great. It encourages them to do more than what they had accomplished.\n\nSadly not many people are great at giving praise. The world is driven by selfishness and self satisfaction, so their only concern is themselves and their worth. This leads to a small set of people similar to us, who continually give and never receives.\n\nTo counteract that, learn to appreciate your own goals and accomplishments. Nothing is more powerful than a kind and selfless person who is emotionally independent from others. Easier said than done, but when you figure it out, you will be happier and no one can ever bring that down.\n\nBut don't forget to give when you can. People like us make the world a better experience, something ENFPs generally abide by. Be fair and kind to others, especially yourself.\n\nGood luck (:
14	I don't think we take from an endless pool of happiness. \n\nI think that we lack self-confidence, and we assume others do as well (and often they do). But what we do to fight this feeling is give confidence to others through encouragement or advice or help, and other people like it because (surprise) it feels great. They assume that because we have encouragement to give that we are smooth sailing and don't need it in return, or they aren't the kind to recognize that encouraging others is important thinking of encouragement as a gift rather than a part of a relationship/friendship and it is taken for granted. \n\nThe defensiveness about people telling us what to do is a byproduct of that insecurity of self-confidence, unless we truly trust the other person its hard for us to acknowledge to others that we don't know whats going on. Our Ne is able to provide us with so many possibilities in any scenario that we are more willing to trust that something we have thought of is more accurate than something someone else is telling me, especially if it doesn't resonate with our Fi, and at times even in the face of our Te. 
7	I think ENFP's have trouble asking for help and support. We want to inspire and help others and we know that if we show "weakness" then we may be ineffective in doing so because we would feel like we don't have the credibility to give advice or inspire if we are vulnerable. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, it's not so much that there's something wrong with "others" not advocating. It's more so that we need to work on loving ourselves first and asking for our own support when we need it.
7	I work as a trainer for managers and leaders and this plays right into on of the things I teach.  \n\n\nEVERYONE needs a coach.  Or, as we will call it in this scenario... a cheerleader.  \n\n\nLook at every single truly successful leader.  The ones who are well loved and respected.  If you asked them, each and every one can list at least 5 people who they go to when they just aren't feeling right or don't know what to do.  \n\n\nI can give another reason we need them.  \n\n\nMy ex wife was a counselor. She would spend her whole day talking to people with all types of problems.  Very often, super serious issues that would weight on her.  She had to spend all day being a cheerleader for these people.  When she came home, it would be my job to take over and be her cheerleader.  To tell her she was doing the right thing.  That the advice she gave was sound.  Being a cheerleader is a wonderful thing, but it's also incredibly draining.
7	Am ENFP social worker/therapist. I‚Äôm a great advocate for others. I‚Äôm really bad at it myself
7	Somehow the intj version of cheerleading really seems to click with you guys. A small nod and a matter of fact "you got this" and you guys are like good to go. Other feelers that want to dig and talk and ask why and cry with you, you really appreciate too, but you leave having not accomplished the goal which required the cheerleading in the first place. 
4	I don't think that it's a `we analyze, judge, fight back`matter. Instead, I think that we mainly feel misunderstood (also because we have some problem communicating about ourselves). Sometimes we already know what's wrong with us, it's just that we need to process that internally IF we don't find somone capable of hearing us.
4	the world need more enfps
2	Ugh, it gets worse if you ever become a therapist. Lol. Being everyone‚Äôs cheerleader becomes your job. Had a bad work week, bitter. Lol!
1	True
1	I feel this on a personal level. I get to a point where I just want to withdrawal from everyone because I feel like I give and give and help and try to make things easy/better for others but I never get the same in return. I do try to keep a lot of my problems to myself because I feel like I would be a burden otherwise. Anyone else feel that way too?
0	i have all the trappings of somebody who has all their shit together.  and yet almost nobody believes at first that i have my shit together.
4	So right now I'm dating our "polar opposite," ISTJ. Any tips?	Me and this ISTJ girl have been dating for a couple weeks now. She's pretty great of course, we have a lot in common, yadda yadda yadda. She's a bit nervous because this is her first relationship, so shes trying to take things mega slow. (Which is tough for me.... but I have patience.)\n\nShe tends to want alone time a lot, and sometimes doesn't want to be touched. I'm.... trying to be cool with that right now? Maybe thats not the best wordage, but I'm adapting. I just.... any tips on communicating my needs more?\n\nLike things are great right now. I just want to know if theres anything I could easily miss with communicating with an ISTJ. Anyone here ever been in the same boat? Any way I can cater more to her needs? (and communicate my own too?) Help this hopeless lesbian out :') 
5	You sound like you already respect her a lot and you're on the right track. Knowing how important communication is is important :) the general rule is, don't be aggressive with you talk about what's bothering you, make sure to listen when she expresses the same, and (I have trouble with this!) understand you have to accept it if you don't hear exactly what you want to hear.
5	I have an ISTJ boss and I‚Äôve found that the best way to communicate with him is to overcommunicate. Tell them your thought process and make sure they understand what you‚Äôre saying. Since ISTJs have the same functions we do, just flipped, it seems to work. Other types don‚Äôt understand us even when we try to explain, but I think ISTJs do. Also, I don‚Äôt know about your ISTJ, but my ISTJ boss really enjoys positive feedback, so if she‚Äôs does too, do tell her often what you appreciate about her (which shouldn‚Äôt be hard for an ENFP!)
3	We ISTJs are very direct in our communication, both in delivery and receipt. We can be blunt, but you can generally take what we say at face value. We will also usually take what *you* say at face value, so we'll probably miss your hidden meanings and subtle hints. \n\nWe also aren't great at processing emotions. More particularly, we're not great at doing it quickly, though some of us (not me) are better at it than others.\n\nAs for not liking to be touched, that's not necessarily an ISTJ thing, though I can relate. There may be a specific reason she doesn't like to be touched. If it's something she can articulate, you can figure out how to work through it from that point of knowledge.\n\nIf it's something she can't articulate, or if it's just something she's not used to, that's probably easier to deal with. I assume your difficulty here is that touch is one of your love languages. If that's the case, say to her something like this: "I know you're not comfortable being touched, and I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but touch is one of my love languages. I don't want to pressure you, but touch is something I need. We don't have to rush into anything, and we can start small. A touch on the arm or holding hands sometimes is a good place to start. I don't need a response right now, so take some time to think about it, and in the meantime, I will be learning your love languages so I can give you what I'm asking you to give me."

10	Does anybody feel that how we react emotionally as ENFPs has a negative effect on the way others view us?	This has revealed itself to me as I've been trying to present a more stable and professional image to my peers at work.  I've gotten pretty decent, but when I encounter the rare "emotional challenge" from coworkers, I break and start reacting emotionally and (in my mind at least) I lose my bearing.  I've gotten pretty good at recognizing it in the moment, but the dissonance between what I'm trying to project and how I naturally want to react makes me shut down and freeze for a few moments.
14	I think I'm usually more emotionally-tinged and when I find shit disagreeable to become cold and Te-like. So the tonal shift is very obvious to others. 
6	Everything you resist gives you pain. Your resistance of being true to yourself will just f you up. Just show who you really are. And I'll give you an advice that you should control your emotions or else it will control you. This applies to all.
6	I've found that spending a lot of quiet time by myself processing my emotions makes me MUCH more able to handle things as they come up in the moment. I used to think my highly emotional nature was my weakness but now I think it's my strength. 
2	YES. Sometimes I'm able to see my emotions as the reason I'm semi-emotionally intelligent, therefore they aren't ALL bad, but other times I feel like I can't stop fucking up other people's perception of me, (even though I have never had my fears of how I come off confirmed by others).
1	It's okay to feel your emotions and go with them, is what I've learned, in the sense that you just let them be without trying to control them. Don't be mean to others but some of it will come out & that's okay.

68	ENFP‚Äôs are the best!	Hello Guys,\n\nFellow ENFJ here saying hello! What‚Äôs your opinion of an ENFJ! You guys are the best! üëçüèª
33	We are emotional creatures that can empathize how others are feeling
15	I love working with ENFJ. We usually get each other quickly and if they are healthy we get along easily. \n\nThey are natural teachers and I can learn a lot from them. \n\nI especially enjoy their open and insightful criticism. \n\nThey have such a strong drive to improve themselves and those around them but their Fe helps them to naturally treat others well (most of the time) and separate the person from their actions. \n\nThat and their discipline is very inspiring for me. 
7	the ones ive encountered seem to be kinda domineering. Iv'e only met male ENFJ and they can be SO stubborn at times but they are there for me when i need help so its not a huge issue. I do admire how you guys can be emotional but also have your shit together. Overall I think you guys make for pretty good people.
6	Fe in concept scares the shit out of me, but you guys are chill, even if by nature we're most likely to disagree
6	Love me some female ENFJs , kind , caring, loving, driven , discipline. I've had some amazing ones in my life and I hope more come my way :P\n\nAlthough at times you guys get way too stubborn to see the other side of the story and even emotionally shut off completely from those who you have these arguments with, really sucks to be on the receiving end. Cause you guys actually don't understand how much you mean to us. \n\nI love you guys :))
3	Enfjs are like enfps that know how to adult
3	It‚Äôs funny because I‚Äôm an ENFP that thinks ENFJs are so awesome too!! Every ENFJ I‚Äôve ever met has been completely hilarious and so fun to be around!
2	Two of my best friends are ENFJs. I love how supportive and fun they are. They inspire me with their discipline and the way they actively work to be their best most healthy selves. Dislike that they can be quite judgey if I am not doing the same. Hanging with fellow ENFP friends feels more chill like I can be my flawed self more.
2	I'm friends with an ENFJ and you guys are great! Quite productive and confident, yet great to hangout with whenever you guys aren't busy. Always felt at ease, comfortable to talk to, and someone to rely on.. mostly haha. Most of all, you guys can definitely motivate us to organize and be more efficient, yet still relate to us.
2	I‚Äôm still trying to determine whether I‚Äôm an INFP or ENFP, but one thing I‚Äôve never had to question is my love for ENFJs.\n\nI seem to attract a disproportionate number of ENFJs into my life as lovers, friends, and mentors. \n\nIn my experience their naturally open, loving, altruistic nature can result in getting hurt by less receptive friends and partners earlier in life. As a result, there‚Äôs a lot of fear about opening up to reveal the deeper, less composed parts of themselves. Personally, I find I need depth to thrive in my interpersonal relationships so there can be an element of disconnect while you‚Äôre still trying to convince your ENFJ you‚Äôre ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù However, once you do manage to establish that rapport you‚Äôve got the most amazing partner, friend, etc you could ask for! They have this instinctive way of making you feel safe and loved no matter what state you come to them in.\n\nWhile XNFPs value their interpersonal relationships, they tend to be very independent people and need a lot of personal space- even in relationships of a closer nature. Giving loved ones their freedom and independence is an extension of respect. ENFJs also value their interpersonal relationships, but as a J-type, the way they show this is different. They seek a greater volume of communication and time spent together than most xNFPs are accustomed to- which can feel stifling for a young XNFP dealing with an ENFJ or vice-versa. The ENFP can perceive the the ENFJ as clingy, and the ENFJ can perceive the ENFP as aloof. My ENFJ‚Äôs steady stream of texts throughout the day are just one of those things I never thought I‚Äôd want or need in a relationship, but now brighten my day, and I know I‚Äôd miss terribly if we were to ever go a day without talking. \n\nENFJs tend to be the ‚Äúglue‚Äù of their friend groups. They have this innate ability to make people feel valued. In times of conflict, people usually look to the ENFJ in the room to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the problem. The ENFJ is going to be the person staging an intervention for the friend/family going off the rails, playing peacemaker in an argument, making sure everyone is doing okay on outings, etc; It‚Äôs a shame their own needs often go unnoticed in their efforts. It make me just want to take care of you guys!!!\n\nOne last thing  I don‚Äôt think ENFJs get enough credit for is their playfulness. These quirky kids have SO much energy, it‚Äôs always overwhelming (even to an ENFP!) All the ENFJs I‚Äôve met have this characteristic quick-witted humor about them. It‚Äôs not surprising that they draw a lot of people in- that positive energy is magic. \n\nA note on ENFJ males: I‚Äôve always been attracted to the more stereotypically ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù men (usually IXFX types) because of the value I place on emotional dialogue but, all the ENFJ men I‚Äôve met have had a really nice masculine aura with a tempered emotionality that we XNFP girls can‚Äôt help but go crazy for. It‚Äôs sexy as HELL.
1	Thanks
1	One of my best friends and former lover is an ENFJ! He's cocky, but sweet, and exceptionally thoughtful and kind. He's a genuinely good person and really has his life put together! Sometimes he'll overthink and get in a spiral, but it never lasts longer than a few days at most and never gets in the way of his work. As an ENFP, I very much envy his willpower there. :')
1	I really  like enfjs. We usually become close  really quickly and then we are bubbly and crazy together  all the time.  Just sad that enfjs are so rare.
1	Aw thanks! I have an ENFJ friend and I think you guys are very sweet. I wish I had your work ethic. Be kind to yourself!
1	one of my closest friends is an ENFJ. it‚Äôs fun making you guys laugh because you try to act all diplomatic then we crack you :)
1	My younger sister is an ENFJ and we get along very well! Especially now that we are both older.  \nI also had an ENFJ coworker and he and I got along really well as well! So far all of my experiences with ENFJs have been great!
1	I LOVE ENFJs! My boyfriend is an ENFJ and we work together beautifully :)
0	I wonder sometimes if I truly am one, because I share one of your functions according to socionics very strongly, I think there is even more diversity to 'typing' based on what I just mentioned, and other circumstances that could change a persons mbti a bit, biological, enviromental, emotional states and mindsets etc.  \n\nI think enfj's generally can be motherly, protective, graceful, mature at their best :)\n\nSometimes they can seem set in their way/view even when presented with truth, and can come off as bossy or controlling 
9	Choice <3	If you were without choice, what meaning would love have? If it were a forced thing, how deeply would it mean? No, love must be given, freely, and of one's own heart.\n\nSometimes, no matter who we are, or what we do, we will never feel like we are enough for some people. Sometimes, we may never feel accepted, or understood, or even loved. In the end, some people may never love you, and, that's their choice.\n\nThough, just as it is our choice to love, as is it God's, and there is nothing you can do to make Him love you any less than completely. He has chosen you. The breath that fills your lungs are evidence of this; You are alive for a reason, for a purpose only you can fulfill. You are special, you are unique, you are chosen, and you are loved. There is so much depth to you, and so much joy and healing you can bring to the world, in the way only you can. You are loved, and you are loved just as you are.
2	Thank you for sharing your grace.
8	What one piece of music or song that speaks to you on a deep level?	I feel like there are only a few songs that come along in a lifetime that feel like they are made just for you, I‚Äôm interested to hear what others are. Mine is Como Me Quieres by Khruangbin.\n\nEdit: Whoops missed a word in the ol title üò¨

1	[Sigur R√≥s - Var√∫√∞](https://youtu.be/Gf1h2PMPCAo) \n\nI listen to this very often, when I‚Äôm in the core of my feelings, either to understand what I‚Äôm feeling, to accept it or to cry and be there with it. I think it speaks to me on a deep level in a way that it can make everything that I‚Äôm feeling look like it‚Äôs floating around and it almost takes it‚Äôs weight off of me for a while. It‚Äôs a really beautiful song and I recommend everyone to sit in their rooms at night, window open and lights off and listen to this... it‚Äôs an experience üíó

2	What's your enneagram (+instinctual variant if u know) and what mbti type are you the most attracted to?	I'm curious
3	enfp 7w8 Sx/So\n\nInfp, enfp, enfj, isfp are usually the most hot to me üôÉ
2	7w6 sx/sp\n\nI tend to be into INTJs and ISFPs üëåüèΩ\n\nI feel like we balance each other out in different ways
2	I noticed most of you are 7w6 or 7w8, and I be sitting here with my 3w2 lol am I still part of the club? \nMostly attracted to INTx currently dating an INTP so I guess it worked out ü§ì
2	I very recently took an enneagram test as I couldn't figure out my type by myself. I got 4w5 as a result, although I hear this shouldn't be possible for an ENFP? Oh well üôÉ\n\nI really enjoy NTs at least as friends, haven't been in enough romantic relationships to know if I have a type, but my partner is an unconfirmed xSFP
2	I am a four. My introversion/extroversion trait is more ambivert. I am intrigued by those who enjoy good meaningful conversation and are also able to carry on the every day. Usually steadier, observant types. Like intj, or 9. I‚Äôm pretty open and engaging but I also realize I‚Äôm intense. I don‚Äôt need (or want!) that intensity to be catered to. But I also find that being around a special someone who is more consistent is like sacred, recentering almost. Ultimately, I‚Äôm drawn to this because I crave being centered and I‚Äôm working to bringing that out in myself. But meeting people who have that natural ability is refreshing. 
2	7w8 I think. I like other ENFP's, someone who thinks like me!
2	2w1\n\nDon‚Äôt have a type per se, but when it comes to friendship I seem to attract other enfps, infp, and esfp, also quite a bit of estjs.\n\nYou could say I am attracted to people who are complex, and often times unhealthy. It‚Äôs my nurturing yet naive nature.
1	I‚Äôm 7w6 ... and I‚Äôm attracted to INTJs(currently with one) and for some weird reason ISTPs (but they never love me back üôÉüíÄüíÄüòÇ)
1	7w8 in a relationship  with an intj. I really get along well with those. \nBut i like fedoms as well especially enfjs.\nFriendshipwise: enfj intj infj esfj isfp infp intp and some rather rarely isfj 
1	7w8 social \n\nthe longest relationship i've had was with an INTJ. But im more attracted to infjs and type 4s. 
1	1w2 and I think I‚Äôve recently figured out my future partner will be an ENFJ! As with friends and other strong connections I enjoy ENFPs, INFPs, INTJs, INFJs, and some ESxx types. \n\nLmao oh yeah and my bestie which is an ENTJ :)
40	DaveSuperPowers: ENFP Builiding Discipline (for reals)	
13	Is it just me or was there a lot of rambling in this video with no clear value to ENFP's? I expected this to be a "How-To" video on building discipline. Title was a bit misleading :) 
6	So we create our own chaos by getting into tough, chaotic situations then use our Ne to fix them and escape. We create our own escape rooms so to speak. I can see this, especially with relationships. This gives us something to Ne with when life gets so boring and predictable and controlled. It's like break something (or find something broken) just so we can put it together to occupy our time and overactive brains.\n\nThis might explain why I often like girls that have big emotional problems and I try to fix them. :O
5	Thanks, op. I had not seen this video yet. I like DaveSuperPowers and watch his videos.\n\nHe speaks very fast. I have to close caption his videos. I wonder if this is an INTJ thing?
4	this video ends with them summarizing you either get "Ne-Fi, or Ne-Te"\n\ncan someone unpack this here in the comments?  This video was a little too into the lingo for me to understand precisely what they were getting at.  
1	This is great, I love davesuperpowers. 
-1	DSP's system is flawed. I wouldnt put too much thought in to what he says. He doesnt have a full understanding on cog functions, especially not Ne.
29	Is The Joker what an insane or dark ENFP would look like?	We ENFPs are known for being very spontaneous,  sporadic, high energy and talkative. Not to mention, caring and charismatic. That got me thinking, would an ENFP that got pushed over the edge end up being like The Joker?\n\nThe Joker is unpredictable. Has disconnected ideas and plans that seem hard to follow, but somehow all have a connection to each other. While other (more sane) villains get thugs to work for them as a presumably higher pay (and probably safer) task force, The Joker manages to get his own through what I can only assume is a combination of charisma and fear tactics.\n\nThe thing that stands out to me the most though, is his smile. His smile always looked like he hurt on the inside, while the world just saw a man who was happily content being evil. ENFPs are known for our duality of high amounts of cheerfulness and despair. Almost at the drop of a hat, in fact.\n\nNow, I don't know if The Joker is an ENFP himself, but I wondered if that is what an "insane" or "Dark" ENFP would look like.\n\nWhat do you guys think? =)
18	Could be! Although personally I think he has the sharp twisted mind of an ENTP.\n\nI don't know, a dark ENFP is in my imagination more like Bellatrix LeStrange from HP, but whatever :)
13	The Joker is definitely an EP who fights IJ Batman. I think their opposite dynamic is what makes him one of the more interesting villains in that series
5	Most cast him as an ENTP from what I've seen online
5	"but I wondered if that is what an "insane" or "Dark" ENFP would look like." It's often called a ENTP.
2	Batman is INTJ while Joker is ENTP
1	Different versions of the Joker.  Some versions could be ENFP but many / most versions are ENTP.  That said why limit yourself based off the stories of the past?  You can make many ENFP villians who are inspired by the Joker, or you can make a new Joker story that is more ENFP and less like the past.\n\n * Note the Joker in other stories can have an ES_P vibe, he is not always an EN_P he just been "coded" that way for the last 3 decades or so but in different ages of the almost 80 year history he has been an ES_P.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSidenote Harley Quinn is usually coded as an ENFP.
4	Searching for the "New Orleans of Europe": Most ENFP city in Europe?	I was always a follower of the idea that it's important to match your surroundings to your personality and especially being an ENFP, I just really need to have the feeling that I'm living among like-minded others. And that the overall vibe of a city feels right. I was always interesting to see scientific studies based on the Big Five personality traits like [this](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/27/3/419) or [this](https://idw-online.de/de/news701496) and after going through the [list of the most liveable cities on the world](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/08/14/vienna-overtakes-melbourne-as-the-worlds-most-liveable-city) and being self-employed/location independent, I decided to give Vienna a go and moved here like a week ago, first and foremost, for a month.\n\nTo be honest, the city has definitely a certain charm, and I was already able to meet a lot of cool people through my flatmates. However, I usually have the impression that all these ranking refer more to the general population which seems to consist mostly of Sensor types, and the things that they value are certainly different from our values and worldviews.\n\nSo many people at [/r/ENFP](https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP) for example mentioned New Orleans as one of the perfect places for ENFPs, full of culture, creativity and a never-ending passion for living. I'd really like to find a "New Orleans of Europe", a place where the city vibe just feels right for us Intuitives.\n\nI'd be very open to move there if I' should feel unsure about Vienna. Nonetheless, Austria itself is very conservative (even though I don't have anything directly against it, there are still so many cool places to explore here), but maybe someone has something interesting to share about that topic. Thought it might be interesting for you, too! :)\n\nCheers!
8	Barcelona 
2	Hmm what about Prague, Budapest, Berlin, or Paris?
2	Hmm. I'm sure you will receive a lot of brainstorming ideas and suggestions on cities but with few real facts to back up. \n\nI'm not sure this is the right place to ask decpite and because of it's crowd.
92	When someone says to me: "I don't know what to say" I instantly feel so much worse :(	Anyone else feel rejected with this phrase after venting to someone about something? I know that it's just a different way of communicating, in the sense that some might only feel helpful if they say something that will "fix" your problem so this is all they got. I guess they just don't realize I'm just looking for someone to say "what you're going through must be hard" or just acknowledging that I'm hurting. After someone says "I don't know what to say" as their only response to me confiding in them, I shut off completely and tell myself that I should distance myself from them, despite knowing that they didn't mean it in a cruel way and that some people just say and interpret things differently. Am I the only one???\n\nEDIT: Many of you are suggesting I communicate how I want support from them, but I do! It has helped enormously. I'm just wondering if anyone else had initial issues with this phrase, regardless of being able to understand why someone is reacting that way and being able to fix the communication.
28	Just give them time to process. Some people need time to analyze and think of what to say.
17	Consider that it may also be their way of letting you know that they are listening, and don't want you to feel left hanging from a complete lack of response.\n\nI get that it feels lonely to feel less than understood. I can't speak for them, but I believe I get what you're conveying here.
11	I have found over a long time and a lot of trial and effort that no one can communicate like us.  That's not good or bad, but it's like a super power.  We can reach into the depths of ourselves and others, and express things others simply can't.  \n\nWhen I was younger I too got really offended when I shared the deepest pain, or the most incredible (to me) finding only to sometimes get nothing as a response.  Some people simply don't have the capacity to take in that kind of information, and even if they can can't express anything in return.  \n\nIt's a trial and error thing.  Once you've determined that person is incapable of processing what you're telling them, you've got to choose whether it's worth you sharing or not.  That's not a judgement of them, but of yourself.  Will you be able to feel expressed just by getting it off your chest?  Even when there is no feedback?
5	OH MY GOODNESS YES\n\nI 100% agree with you. It drives me insane! it feels invalidating and makes it seem (often even moreso) that you're totally alone. This was a big reason my ex and I are no longer compatible; he just couldn't offer me emotional support in the way that I needed it.\n\nAs I read in some of your comments, I agree with you. Even though I knew what I wanted to hear in a way, I wanted them to be the one to produce that sentence and offer it to me. However, in my case, I think I was being harder to please than you, because I (for a while) did not offer my friends, in particular my ex, that explicit instruction on *how* to respond. So, in your case I would suggest that yes, remind yourself that they care. Be open minded. People express their feelings, and thus the processing of them, differently.\n\nYou may have already tried this, but one thing that really helped was telling them that I wanted emotional support and digging deep to give them a HYPER-specific example of what I wanted to hear. (Their regurgitated statement didn't work to comfort me that time, because they had basically just repeated what I said, of course. It didn't feel comforting or genuine at all, even if they meant it to be.) For that time I needed support, I didn't necessarily receive it because I was instead helping them figure out how to help me when I needed their support. However, from that time on, it did get considerably better.\n\nIf they care about you and what to help you, they should be happy to think about how they respond to you. But also consider the way you explain the issue, because it can feel insincere or distracting to them if they work to produce a specific response that you desire, which may not come naturally to them. Ending the topic of your vent with one of these may help:\n\nSo, when I imagine my "perfect response," it usually goes something like this:\n\n* "I'm sorry you've had a rough day. I care for you a lot and want you to know I'm here for you. What bothered you the most today?" and then later... "Could I give you some advice?\n\nThat sounds a little clinical, and it is, because it isn't really directed at anyone. But it hits on a few aspects that I find myself reaching for when I am in a bad place, and I'll break it down in the following few paragraphs. I hope that you resonate with some of this, and please restructure it as you see fit. I'm breaking it down this way in hope that you find this helpful and can share information like this with your friends/family. So, here goes:\n\n* "I'm sorry you've had a rough day."\n\nShows sympathy and that they listened correctly. It lets me know that even if they can't relate, they're sympathetic to what I'm going through. It also shows that they've addressed the correct "mood" of the situation right off the bat.\n\n* "I care for you a lot and want you to know I'm here for you."\n\nReminds me that I'm not alone (which can be hard to feel/remember when you are in a challenging position!), and that I'm cared for. It shows me that I'm not wasting anyone's time, and that they actually *want* me to come to them in times like this. It also makes me feel all warm and fuzzy and soft to have feelings expressed so openly like that. Again, usually this part would be different based on the relationship you have with whomever you're speaking with.\n\n* "What bothered you the most today?" or "Why do you think that xx did that?"\n\nShows that they've really listened to what you've said and want to hear more about it. For me, this part is really important. It is the part that makes you feel understood. They don't have to know the answers, but I want them to take an interest in my emotions. This directly does that by devoting time talking about the reasons as to why I feel. You want to continue the conversation and you're willing to sit with them until it they feel better.\n\n* "Could I give you some advice?"\n\nPretty self-explanatory, but for me, it divides the conversation. First, I told them about the whole mess of my feelings. Then, they sympathized with me; reminded me that I'm not alone AND cared for enormously; wanted to learn more/expressed an interest in my feelings; and now they want to come full-circle and help me overcome this issue in the future! (If it will be relevant.)\n\nWell, this is how it works for me, so it might have been pretty specific. I would elaborate a bit more on how to also focus more on yourself, because you can't of course expect everyone else to make you feel better, but for the sake of my sanity for tomorrow, it's time for me to nod off. I hope some of this has been helpful to you! Please don't be afraid to contact me if you would like to elaborate further xx
4	Damn. I‚Äôve had times like that where I just shut off when some of my friends does that. I totally understand the frustration of opening up to someone and having your feeling unacknowledged by them. It sucks bigtime. Hang in there buddy ‚ù§Ô∏è
4	Well, im a person who usually says this, but often I follow it up with something like "Im sorry this is happening". To me, I dont know what to say means "Im still listening to you and I wont to show you by saying something, and I just dont know what. And I wont risk saying anything because you deserve more than just anything that crosses my mind."
5	When someone says to me: "Here's some weed" I instantly feel so much better : )
3	This is exactly what the last guy I was seeing said to me when I asked if he had cheated on me. Definitely NOT the answer I prefer in most scenarios üò¨
3	It's because most of the time they don't actually need to say anything. Like when someone confides in me in this way I'll look at them and kind of nod in understanding. But you feel like you need to say something, when you don't, which is why people say "I don't know what to say".
2	It‚Äôs very hard in those moments. I usually just ask for a hug
2	Nope, not the only one. I have exactly the same feelings about it. I vent because I trust that person. It feels like I have misjudged the quality of our connection if I'm responded to in this way. I feel pretty misunderstood, then. I mean, that's not to say that I'm always so unhealthy about it. I know that their response is fair enough. But my first instinct is to feel pretty frustrated.\n\nINFJ by the way. And that's probably why our types get along. Because we understand the importance of feeling emotionally understood or acknowledged. In general. I've had an ENFP's optimism prevent me from feeling like I could be open with them, because I felt like my feelings were invalidated with a variation of "cheer up, keep trying :)" -- I mean, they weren't hollow words, but I need room to be a brooding cynic sometimes.
2	I don't really feel that way. Younger me probably would have felt that way, but I find it kind of refreshing when someone lets me know that they don't have an entire grasp on my situation. A lot of the TJs in my life do this, and I don't mind at all. Just the fact that they listened is what matters to me.
1	For me, it really depends on their tone and their facial expression. If I know it was a frustration, I'd feel bad and usually tries to fix it or stop whatever I'm talking about.
1	After 4 months of pretty intense and consistent dating, I confessed my feelings to my then "undefined" boyfriend. I was open and lucid and sincere. And this was his exact response. "I don't know what to say." The lines that ended the relationship.\n\nHe told me later that he'd never heard someone speak with such honesty. Evidently, some people can't handle that emotional honesty. Even after spending 4 tender months together. Oh well. 
1	My fave answer when I am lost is "lifes still good". I learned it from a  boss of mine who I suspect was an enfp. 
1	Yessss it feels so depowering (can't find the right word to say) 
1	It's definitely a fair reaction. I personally get irritated/angry as a reaction..  It's just because I'm looking for something specific- for someone to validate and empathize. Then I laugh at myself because I can realize my needs and that not everyone can always say the right thing on the spot. \n\nIt's fair to communicate your needs too. I'm not sure why this is taboo, but it's really healthy. Before you Start, say: I'm not looking for a solution, I just need some reassurance/validation/empathy. Most people once they know exactly what you want, will respond with something more on point.\n\nMany people will still need guidance, even if you say "i need validation", you may need to clarify. I have a couple friends who ask me: " what do you need/ want to hear from me right now?" If they are at a loss for words and it really opens up the communciation. Obviously pick your people - they have to want to improve their communciation to do this. 
1	Yes, I understand how you‚Äôre feeling. What a lot of people do not understand, majority of the time when people vent about problems, they‚Äôre looking for emotional support and empathy, not seeking the response to be an immediate ‚Äúfix‚Äù to the solution. \n\nUsually the highest priority FIRST is support. Ways to resolve this issue come after. It‚Äôs actually supported by relationship research as well that most partners get frustrated when their partner respond by immediately trying to fix their problem. \n\nIn your situation, as others said, it would have probably gone much further with you had your partner hugged you, patted you on the back, simply said ‚Äúwow, that‚Äôs horrible‚Äù etc.\n\n
1	I'm an enfp too and idk if thats making me take things personally but I'm in your shoes a lot!! I have depression and often need to vent or just dont know how to explain my problems but my boyfriend is always trying to fix the issue and almost gets defensive when I tell him that I don't need advice. and yet he literally cannot grasp this concept no matter how many times I address it. I even gave him some online stuff to read about it. He is an istj and thinks very diff than me. But yeah I can relate and it sucks. 
1	I understand how you can feel that way. My husband is an INTP and sometimes his initial response is just to look at me in silence for what feels like forever and then change the subject. I understand that he's just processing how to respond and when he can't figure out a "solution" to what I'm venting about he changes the subject to try and cheer me up. I know he's trying his best to handle the situation as he sees best, but sometimes I wish he'd just say "I'm sorry you're going through that" and hug me. 
1	When I get this response I flat out tell them, "I don't need you to say anything. I just needed to vent." 
1	So, what I do when I know I'm about to unload onto my boyfriend or my best friend (who are my go to listeners) is specifically tell them if I need advice, or if I just need to rant and be comforted. My best friend's form of comfort is to try to give advice and help, but sometimes I just need to get stuff out there without feeling like I need to shut up and get to work and fix it. We both do this with each other, a quick disclaimer, and it works very well.\n\nWhen it comes to my boyfriend, he had the tendency to not say anything at all when I'm talking about something upsetting to him, which bothered me. It made me feel like he's tuning me out or waiting for me to be done talking. He actually does this because he literally doesn't know what to say to make me feel better and stays quiet rather than say the wrong thing. I've told him that I don't care if you accidentally say the wrong thing, if it's an honest misstep I will not get mad, and sometimes I just need to hear "I hear you, I'm acknowledging you, I'm sorry you feel this way." And he's gotten so much better about doing just that.\n\nTLDR: COMMUNICATE! Next time people in your life say "I don't know what to say" just tell them "I'm not expecting you to fix anything, I just need to be heard and need a friend." or something similar.
1	I HATE IT
0	It‚Äôs hard to just say basic support most people tend to think they need to help including. Distancing yourself because of that is a pretty shitty thing to do in my opinion 
8	Purpose of life	This might be cheesy but i think about this most of the times. I was wondering if anyone has found the answer to our existence? 
6	There is no answer therefore you can pick one for yourself and roll with that until it isn't enough. One thing I've found to be true is that we are what we are until we need to be something else and so on and so forth. Reality is in a constant flow of evolution. I have a tendency to grow attached and furiously seek to possess all around me. Desire is my shackle, therefore I've decided that my purpose is surrender. What's yours?
5	I have settled with the idea that there isn't one. You only get one shot, make it count. Live life to the fullest. Enjoy every single moment you get.\n\nHonestly as long as the people around me are happy, then I'm happy. Maybe that's my purpose.
3	I think everyone has their own take on what our purpose of life is. What I've been finding interesting to read recently are people's Near Death Experiences, which kind of made me see things differently than before about the answer to our existence. :3 But honestly, just like what u/MasterPew said, you can kinda just pick one for yourself, there's no real answer.\n\nWhat I think the purpose of life is, is to be kind, to love fully and make your life here on earth pleasant for yourself and others around you through acts of service. BUT like I said, that's just me.
3	The purpose of life is to create every possibility. Because life itself is just a possibility. 
2	I believe we are in this life to progress. I believe we are to face challenges and difficulties and learn to overcome them. I believe we are here to form relationships that can endure through the eternities. I believe we are here to learn to love and serve others. \n\nAnd I believe that all these things are connected to follow the example of Christ and becoming like our Father in Heaven, and this life is about preparing to be with them and like them.\n\nRomans 8:16-18\n2 Nephi 2:25-27\n\nhttps://www.mormon.org/beliefs/purpose-of-life
1	The point of life is to be invested and engrossed enough in the act of living so as to NOT ask that question.
1	It is to survive, biology life, to keep populations going . The beauty of it is that every person can assign their own purpose based on what they find meaningful 
1	Wattswave IV: Dreams \nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/3nbCR6OsvvZTYI0yXNGxFA?si=UxlgPn2FSnyYjEdYWa70RQ
1	I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve figured it out, obviously, but it‚Äôs good to see so many ENFP‚Äôs with similar views of existence.  Who knows why we‚Äôre here, truly, but following your happiness is the only purpose I‚Äôve found.  Experiencing life and trying to appreciate the good as well as the bad.  \n\nLately, I‚Äôve been listening to a lot of Jordan Peterson‚Äôs lectures on psychology and trying to make better understand Jung‚Äôs work.  I recommend checking out some of Jordan Peterson‚Äôs thoughts on the self, and how we can die and be reborn.  (I could do without the religion talk but he also talks a lot about symbology from a Jungian perspective which is pretty cool).\n\nIt‚Äôs an interestingly fine line between living an examined life and enjoying it.  Hope you find the balance!
1	We where created to love, be loved, and commune. 
1	 Why does life need to have a purpose? It just is, and our inflated egos can't accept that.Ôªø \n\nwe humans, like all other beings, have a function. but the purpose? It's your life, you get to pick the purpose. 
1	I believe each person is born with a different purpose, in fact many. What I have realized through spirituality is we are ALL connected, every single living organism on this earth, and we came from the same origin as stardust. It‚Äôs really incredible and mind blowing to realize that, and my advice is to do some deep self reflection and soul searching to honor your values and use them as your ‚Äúcompass‚Äù for living your life. That is your purpose, to me. 
12	How to convince an ENFP that they're doing something wrong?	I have an ENFP friend whose not doing well, I haven't really don't much to help but now I realised its the time for me to help him. I find it hard to talk to him and convince him into doing what is right, anyone got any advice?
26	At least for me, most of the time you can't. At least, not right away. If you call me out (even gently) and I get defensive, *I'm still going to think about it later*, and I might change. I just might have a hard time admitting you're right. Although, I think I'm more stubborn than most ENFPs. Whenever you bring it up, don't make it a point to prove, but make it about you caring for his well-being. I don't know if "convincing" is  the way to go.
7	So generally I make decisions based on what I feel is "right" not necessarily logical. So this ENFP might think this is the intuitively "right" thing to do. Showing Enfp how this could effect others and having them see from a different perspective could have them reevaluate their decision. They need to be open to change though, an unhealthy ENFP might not see beyond their own needs, and will just respond by saying your are wrong and to go stuff yourself in a hole. Just try to make sure he understands that you are coming from a place caring.
7	I commend you. You are a very good friend.\n\nDon't listen to him.\n\nWatch his actions. Is he thinner or heavier? Is he perspiring? Does he avoid social contact? Is he failing at work or school? Who hangs around him when he is not alone?\n\nDoes he do anything like AirDuster? Is his family in trouble? Has his schedule or work ethic changed?\n\nActions speak louder than words. Good Luck. I wish everyone had a friend like you.
5	hello i‚Äôm a very strong enfp (if that‚Äôs a thing??? idk my percentages on the test are high lol ) anyways. i know our stereotype is always sweet and free spirited, but we are very stubborn. \n\nmy best advice for you is to tell them you know where they‚Äôre coming from, but it is not the best bet for this specific situation. \n\n**we feel helpless usually when we think people aren‚Äôt listening to us or just dont understand what we‚Äôre trying to say, and when people talk over me/ argue and be contrary makes me LITERALLY SHUT DOWN and get pissed off.**\n\nHERES WHATCHA DO: talk to him/ her for a while about their side of the story. dedicate one entire sit down conversation to just agreeing/ having them explain their opinion. \n\nbe like ‚Äúoh yeah i guess that makes sense‚Äù etc. and then come to them maybe the next day or something and say something along the lines of ‚Äúok so i get your point. and i thought about it. i think _____ would be better for this situation. but i 100% understand your point of view.‚Äù\n\n** if you give them indication that you fully understand what they‚Äôre trying to say and just let them talk about it and ask them questions so they think you‚Äôre really engaged and getting it, they won‚Äôt be as frustrated when you have a different opinion. **
7	Don't. Just don't. 
3	Ask him why he made the choice he did, what was his framework / goal.\n\nDo not judge him when you ask this question, but instead seek to understand the ENFP.\n\nThen suggest other complimentary goals he can pursue, help him brainstorm and think up different strategies, different goalposts, etc.  Help him help himself.
2	I agree. Show them how what they are doing impacts others negatively and more likely to respond to change.
1	Come to him from a place of love and understanding--emphasize the love! And be extra gentle. Dont critique, instead ask questions and express concern.

0	Need help typing my Mom (ENFx)	Hello all! I need some help typing my Mom, I know she must be ENF-X, but I can't figure out if she's ENFP (like me but a healthy and more mature one) or ENFJ. We're both pretty close so I know her character and personality very well, until now the biggest difference I find between us is the fact that she can make a plan and stick to it. Though, I'm not so sure about her type... Can you guys help me figure this out?\n\nThx in advance!! :D
3	ENFP and ENFJ are completely opposite. They have none of the same cognitive functions. Have you studied the functions? This is the best way to type. To find which one they lead with and their 2nd.\n\nhttps://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/if-youre-confused-about-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-read-this-an-intro-to-cognitive-functions/\n\nhttps://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/12/how-each-cognitive-function-manifests-based-on-its-position-in-your-stacking/\n\nhttps://www.typeinmind.com/nefi/

9	How do i detach from my need of external validation?	So here's the deal. I don't know if any of you read heidi preibe's book "comprehensive ENFP survival guide" but i did and in the enneagram section i totally identified With "type 2: helpers" ENFPs.\n\nI've always had an excruciating need for validation that i've only come to notice recently. I'd catch myself willing to toss away any of my personal desires or feel very uncomfortable with doing things for myself because i worry too much about keeping myself as the "very good and principled individual" and with time this is getting difficult.\n\nI don't really want to go out of my way and take the advice and exercices from a therapist about this because i'll be relocating soon to another country and i can't have solid follow ups so i wanted to take you guys' opinion on this if anyone actually experiences it.\n\nI want to benefit form each of your creative ways of dealing with this because i really want to start loving myself the same way i love my partner or loved my ex-partners but i'm unable to. I prioritise pleasing others on my personal pleasure and i reached a point where i'd do it as a reflex but hate it afterwards. \n\nI mean making others happy is sth i feel great about but i don't want to do it out of dependency on the validation from it but because i feel good enough and fulfilled and i'd want to channel that through my good deeds without me being an expense in this.\n\nI really want to get your insights and wisdom on this, how do i detach from this need of validation from others and people-pleasing and maybe ideas of things i could do to make me feel better about myself or prioritize myself, how did you guys get through this
12	I suffered from Social Anxiety Disorder most of my life. It is not quite the same but I would never want anyone to think anything bad about me at all and thus would never say or do anything that would make me embarrassed or have anyone think worse of me. This basically meant I did nothing, said nothing, and had no friends.\n\nOnly in recent years am I mostly over it. I have learned not to care what people think. Either they think something good about me, which is good, or bad. If it is bad it is either a lie, in which case I don't worry as I know who I am, or it is true in which case I don't worry either. I welcome criticism because it tells me what I need to change and improve so I can grow.\n\nI have also suffered a lot from low self-esteem and insecurity. I would feel I wasn't as good as others, was a loser, boring, ugly. I didn't think I deserved as much as others. In college I stayed in my room because I felt my room mates deserved the coo on apartment spaces more than me. And it was the same for the whole world. I didn't think I deserved as much space as others on Earth.\n\nOnly in the last year have I started to get over this. My girlfriend has helped me. I am starting to realize I am actually attractive and good and talented and fun and interesting. It's actually crazy. I always thought comments were just people being nice. Now I am thinking back on things people said and believing them. It is nuts. I look band see old pictures of myself and I'm like "Whah? Who am I? I am handsome! I was handsome then! And now! Whaaaaa!" It's mind-boggling. I look like a different person to me.\n\nSo I think these are the secret inner issues to seeking validation. Low self-esteem insecurity and a need to be liked (or at least not disliked). To get over them just takes a change in perspective.\n
4	How would you feel if someone started using you as a source of validation? Wouldn‚Äôt that suck? You didn‚Äôt sign up to be the warden of their emotional well-being. Why can‚Äôt you guys just have a normal relationship and stay in your respective lanes? It‚Äôs not fair really. Like a form of emotional vampirism.\n\nSo why would you do that to others? 
3	Ooo this is a really tough one. We are all different, but something that has helped me is reading a lot about codependency and different attachment styles. And from there, focus all my energies on figuring out what it is that *I* truly want out of my life and learn how to take care of myself independently. I will say that this is one of the most excruciatingly difficult things to come to terms with, but it is 100% worth the effort. Just don‚Äôt give up. \n\nFor example, I‚Äôve learned to just sit with myself and be mindful of how I‚Äôm feeling, physically, emotionally and spiritually. If I‚Äôm feeling terrible, I really think it over and try to come to terms with what exactly is bothering me and what might help, whether it‚Äôs journaling, calling a friend who understands me well, going off on a new adventure or, hell, just remembering to eat dinner. I‚Äôve noticed that the more I do this, rather than focusing on how others feel, what they think, what they think of ME, etc., the more grounded and centered I feel in who I am. And when I feel strong about myself, I need a lot less validation from others and it‚Äôs easier to let go of outcomes because I know that I‚Äôm doing my best for *myself.* Think about every aspect of your life that you have control over, and how YOU would like it to look. And figure out what that would take. Step by step. \n\nAnyway, sorry that was so long. This is just something that I really relate to and I wish you the best!
3	If you're a reader I would highly recommend "the 7 habits of highlight effective people" Changing yourself is a grind but this book is a great tool for that. But you have to truly want to change it it takes a long time. \n\nits not just some dumb self help book that will "transform your life". Its gives great insights on personality and what it really means to be human. We are not our emotions or our insecurities. We are what we want to be. \n\nAnother great book is "a mans search for meaning" which is heavily referenced in ""the 7 habits of highlight effective people". It sounds cheesy and played out but if you read these you'll truly get a different perspective on confidence and life itself.

6	Sucks that all the jobs I want are not really well paid	I'm learning computer programming these days and I want to learn how to make a horror game in the future. I found out that game programmers do not get paid well and they're likely to have an unstable job. Makes me wonder bout life. Y'know this world is encouraging creativity and such but they don't really pay well for creative writers, movie makers and such unless you really reach the top. I may be too negative at the moment.
6	Most creative jobs are freelance/word of mouth. Get good and you can name your price. Make good friends that will get you work üëåüèΩ
5	Why not work a corporate programming job?\n\nHalf the hours, double the pay of game dev, and most of the time you work on more interesting things too.
3	Nothing pays better than your passion and love of something. Go out there and prove the statistics wrong!
1	The average salary of a video game programmer according to Zip recruiter is $84,939. That sounds pretty good.\n\nI used to know a video game programmer. He was developing one of the Sims games. He seemed well off and he liked what he did. I think there is a satisfaction of being able to say, I made that.\n\nResource: https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Video-Game-Programmer-Salary

29	what makes someone instantly irresistible to you?	i realized that what i like the most about the people i feel really attracted to is their passion for what they do. seeing someone giving their best at what they love, seeing the sparkle in their eyes when they talk about it, seeing and feeling the pure passion when they do it, it's really something.\n\nthere's this guy, he's a jazz pianist and at the age of 21 he's already one of the best pianist/composer i've seen. he's just too much. we've hook up a couple times and he still makes me stupidly nervous every time i see him and i still can't believe he actually wanted to see me haha.
7	I feel like all ENFP's like Jazz....or is it just me?
8	same! and as honest about themselves as possible
13	Yes! I am irresistibly drawn and attracted to people who are Interested. I have always wanted to be really really good at something. I am really good at cooking, baking, roasting or any kind of potatoes. \n\nMy High School crush was a fantastic jazz player. He was so cool. He was so out of my league but we were friends and we even had one date. I did not know how to dance. He took someone else to Prom.\n\nI looked him up recently, convinced he was in a cool jazzy Dixieland place where musicians roamed freely and they were all creatives. Imbued with sophistication and a style that I could never realize or belong with.\n\nGuess what? He's a very nice man who performs in the desert. He worked cruise ships and he performs in small communities. He is not one bit cool but he is still creative and still making music.\n\nI would tell myself and you...don't be afraid of him. You both will grow up and while he will have the Cool Yearbook Photo, I had a pretty Cool life myself and finally caught up to his Cool. \n\nNow, Fred...come play for us in the Cumberland.\n\nHugs.

5	I‚Äôm not sure how to describe it, but it‚Äôs the opposite of apathy. It‚Äôs passion, knowledge, and piercing curiosity all in one.
4	A great sense of humor has always been my #1 weakness when it comes to being attracted to someone. 
3	1 good conversationalist\n\n2 someone grounded and stable\n\n3 handy o.o \n\n&#x200B;
3	When I talk about a subject, and the other person either has thought about it and shares, or starts to think for himself right now and shares.
2	I appreciate a wide array of positive personality traits (even some negative ones unfortunately), so it‚Äôs mostly down to physical attraction.\n\nIf I have to pick a few:\n- passion (on anything, from art to science, to sports, etc.).\n- compassion / kindness. That‚Äôs what heroic to me.
3	Trying to figure out my type	So, since I have a hard time understanding the functions because I am constantly looking for new definitions that I can relate to, I can never truly find my type. I hear so many definition and the same type agreeing with one another, after hearing that no type is the same, well... that's a bit contradictory. I was told that I was comfortable with and even tried to rationalize my emotions that indicates Ne-Fi, which I in fact stated that I am much comfortable discussion emotional things through text because it seems impersonal and something manageable. I just hate when people get vulnerable with me because it feels like picking and poking. I would rather have a conversation that shares like minded interests or just discussing things in general. The only time I ever talked about how I felt was when I was constantly being manipulated by my mom. Then again, I was very emotional growing up, but didn't necessarily cry other than the fact that I was always bullied. I was that type of kid, and still is, that would not pay attention and say "I'll learn it later". Because I actually did learn a lot and learned much better by myself. I stopped doing that out of laziness or boredom. I did want to share that information with others, but who would listen? 
2	C.s. joseph on youtube. He is a good communicator 
2	There is a train of thought in reference to personality types that says we can identify people as Talkers, Touchers, Listeners. My husband is an ESTP and I have recently found that it helps to use hand gestures and body language and include concrete words that reflect touch and feel.\n\nTouchers need to reach out and pat someone. They describe things using words like poke and prod. You discuss feelings in your writing. You sound sensitive and easily hurt. Then you question yourself.\n\nPerhaps you are an SP? [https://personalitymax.com/personality-types/temperaments/sp-creator/](https://personalitymax.com/personality-types/temperaments/sp-creator/)\n\nI can't go farther than that without peeking behind your curtains but I have noticed your user name and comments, I believe. I don't know about Ni but I do read Ne. I am newish to MBTI so I hope this is helpful, somehow.
2	It is very hard, if not impossible, to type yourself and many mistype themselves. You should get at least 10 people that know you really well, friends, family, coworkers, etc. and ask them questions: what qualities do they like about you, what do they hate what do they talk about about you behind your back, what mistakes do they keep seeing you make, what are your flaws, what are your strengths, what do they envy, what is something you do with your personality they can't. If 7 out of 10 says something it is probably true. And that is how you can find all that info about who you really are, not just your biased, half-blind self view. Because we can't see all of ourselves and we lie to ourselves too.

7	‚ÄúShe has such good ideas and ‚Äúworld‚Äù , but a hard time focusing and implementing/ getting these ideas down properly ‚Äú - every teacher at parent teacher interviews	Anyone else relate ? My parents would come back saying teachers had said this about me . As well as ‚Äúhead in the clouds ‚Äú and ‚Äúvery disorganized ‚Äú 
5	World? What is that referring to?
2	Yep. Which is how I got placed in AVID because I was a smart kid who didn't apply themselves and had little to no direction lol. 
2	They used to tell my parents I liked to talked, Was always asking questions in class and when it came to classwork I finished it fast so I could start having fun with friends, but that got in the way of my friends finishing their homework. One teacher once said that I seemed to get the grasp of everything quite easily and  do well in classes with seemingly no effort, and a lot of friends asked me how I did so good when I was always doing something else in class, like drawing on books, or reading in my tablet, and I had always such a mess in my desk and locker, they were funny.
2	EVERY. DAMN. TIME. "You write so well, sometimes your prose comes at the expense of clarity." "Profound observations, but I'm missing the jump from the last paragraph to hear." "Good, but bring in the scope a little bit." Oy vey. 
1	Yes I relate heaps. Put in a lot of effort Learning to embrace the traits of conscience people and that has allowed me to over come this problem to an extent
1	No.  My teachers were mostly complimenting how well behaved we were.\n\nAnd then there was my Oklahoma History teacher...\n\nHis first year there, I was a Freshman, my older sister was a Sophomore, and we both had to take one of his classes (OK History for me, American History for her).  It started off with him telling my mom "Your kids are so well behaved and so smart. If I ever have kids, I hope they're like your kids."\n\nThen he tried to be a tyrant, and that just didn't work for us.\n\nThe short version goes like this:\n\n* He tried to make me take notes\n* I didn't want or need to take notes, so I didn't\n* He got uptight about it and called my mom.\n* My mom told him he was stupid and as long as I was passing the quizzes, she didn't see any point in making me take notes. Told him if I failed a quiz, she'd make me take notes even if that meant she had to sit next to me in class to make it happen.\n* He tried to pull a "gotcha!" and sabotage me by kicking me out of class while he lectured which caused me to fail the next quiz (still got 30% right even though I heard 0% of the lecture).\n* I responded to his "You're going to have to take notes now!" declaration with a "Wanna bet?" and told my mom exactly what happened.\n* My mom ripped him a new asshole.\n* I still didn't have to take notes and treated him like shit for the rest of high school because he had destroyed all respect I might have had for him. (For the record, he had done other things to lose the respect of most of the rest of the student body by the end of that first year and even our soft-spoken, laconic, and eventual valedictorian was having none of his shit by the end of Freshman year.)\n* He no longer wanted his kids to be like my mom's kids.
5	When you are not feeling your best/ off- what do you do to pull yourself out of it?	
7	I usually go try out new things by myself if I feel down. Get a sandwich or a bagel from some place I've never tried before or enjoy some coffee in downtown Toronto. I also play video games or watch poker or baseball on Youtube. 
3	Setting aside the time to create. Taking pictures of puddles or other inconsequential things that generally lack beauty and making them beautiful. Making origami bunnies and hiding them in trees, bushes, stores, and restaurants for people to find. I generally just try to enjoy the world in it's subtle magics and wonders by bringing them to the surface with art and humor. If everybody else is smiling, than I usually am as well... More so, if I am the one making them smile 
3	Honestly I take a hot shower. Something about showering and the feeling of being cleansed has always made me feel better one way or another. I always feel good after a hot shower :) 
3	This is honestly a tough question. :( I like to think I have many different levels of not feeling great and there's different ways I handle each level. I've been throwing myself into extroverted activities to pull myself out of it lately, even if I have an anxiety attack before hand, just gotta power through it because you always know you'll have a fun time in the end. 
5	ADHD/ADD	Hi guys, i am currently 20 years old. During my study a coach of mine notes that it might be a good idea for me to look up HSP and difficulty to delay rewards. Once i started to look up HSP it all seemed to make sense. Now fast forward a year and I am not quite sure about it anymore.\n\nNext monday I have an appointment to look into ADD/ADHD and I was wondering wether a lot of ENFP's have been diagnosed with ADD or ADHD and I was curious about your stories. 
4	I have, but I believed it was a special ability to notice everything. I just worked on it and honed it in, really helps. I'm known as the details guy.
3	I was diagnosed as a kid but my parents took me off medication after a few months.  I haven't been diagnosed as an adult but I have been seriously wondering about it lately. 
2	I'm 34 and recently read an article about symptoms of ADHD in adult women and I related to it so much i cried. I'm an ENFP. Dr appointment on the 14th I'll let ya know. It sure would explain a ton... 
140	Who else relates?	
13	Wow I didn‚Äôt need a personal attack today üò£
9	YES! And it is so stupid that i actually realize this, but can¬¥t help it, my brain/feelings still makes me feel like nobody likes me and that i am just worthless.
5	Yeeeah. I need to take those daily.
4	‚ÄúDo I annoy you?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs it okay that I‚Äôm here?‚Äù ‚ÄúDo you enjoy this? Because I can leave.‚Äù I know that feeling all too well.
3	Fuk
3	I need like 12 of these daily ü•∫
3	OK so just yesterday my brain collected some evidence (2 ignored emails and an event he turned down) and I accused a very good friend of mine that he doesnt give a shit about me and that I felt ignored and marginalized. I think I went a little overboard. When my brain detects the slightest sense that someone is ignoring me or might not want me around I have this HUGE response of withdrawing or going all passive-aggressive. It becomes so hard to cool down and actually listen to another person while I am in this hypersensitive state of "He/She doesn't care about me" I just want to RUNNNN
2	I can‚Äôt believe how many of these are like exactly me, wtf. How are there so many others like me??
1	holy shit
129	Anyone relate to having a conversation with someone you‚Äôre interested in and totally romanticizing it and reading every little thing? Any tips on how to chill for a second on that?	
47	Yeah... I can develop a hard-core long lasting crush on somebody who I barely know. It‚Äôs quite alarming. I have to remember times I‚Äôve felt that way in the past about a guy, but then did a 180¬∞ turn when I actually got to know him. That helps me keep some wits about me. I‚Äôm a huge romantic and am always thinking, is THIS the person I‚Äôve been waiting for all my life? It‚Äôs a struggle haha but also makes life more fun 
48	YOU ARE AN ENFP. \nWE.\nDO.\nNOT.\nHAVE.\nCHILL.\nOKAY???? \nNOW BACK TO TRYING TO BE LIKED BY EVVVVVVERRRRRYYONEEEE
24	The only thing I've found that works (for me) is to remember that a crush is just that. I'm gonna fall in crush with everyone around me, because I honestly care about people, but I shouldn't get that twisted up with the deeper, more long-lasting feeling that a crush COULD develop in to.   \n\n\nAlso, trying (it's so hard, but, it's important) to stay in the moment, instead of fantasizing about the future. That's been a veeeeeery hard lesson to learn.  \n\n\nReally, though, crush away. The world needs more caring and love. 
11	Read the texts as if someone else wrote the, a friend or family member or coworker and see if you would feel the same things. Hopefully that way you can tell if you're just reading into things or not.
7	this has been a HUGE problem for me since i was 14/15 lol. i tend to like different people all the time and i got to the conclusion that that's because as an ENFP i always idealize people (obviously). first, i only see all these beautiful things about them and expect them to be that beautiful in every single thing they do/think, but then i start to get bored of them or i just stop liking them from one day to another and that's because i already put too much expectative on them and well, that's not their fault.\napart from being way too idealistic i'm really affectionate and when i like a person i tend to form some kind of bond really quick with them and this ends up with them falling for me and me getting bored after two weeks. this has made me feel like trash a big part of my life. \n\nbut now, having passed a great number of these kind of situations, i finally truly learned that im a serious idealistic and i try to recognize this attitude, and that made it easier for me to relax when i'm meeting somebody. it's not necessary to want or to try to stop that curiosity and intensity you feel when you know somebody 'cause honestly, it's really fun and it's harmless, but what's really important is to remember and accept that you're like that and that you will do that over and over again with everyone you like. remember that EVERYONE, even though they look like the most incredible individual in the world, is a regular person with their good and bad stuff. we ENFPs like to improve ourselves all the time, but a lot of people don't even recognize their bad behaviours or manners and they're far away from working on them, so be ready for that and you'll be okay!
3	Talk to them.  \nAll of my things like that are affected by my past trauma too so along with what you said I can get little paranoias from the stuff I read into.  \nI interact with the people on purpose with the idea of proving myself wrong and fact checking.  If they are close enough or we are open about our feelings I even tell them the thought. It keeps me out of the fantasies my head can get lost in :D\n
5	Ok this‚Äôll sound unorthodox but if I ‚Äúwant ‚Äú to keep myself in check and remember when I should lol this actually helps a ton. \n\nI‚Äôm INFJ and love to love. \nAnd Enneagram 5 which loves to overthink. So we‚Äôre not so different. \nI‚Äôm INFJ A but that‚Äôs besides the point here. Using both sides of my brain I‚Äôve learned ways of manifesting use of particular parts of my brain when I‚Äôm consciously aware of the need to do so. \n\nI‚Äôve shared this with other types-people I‚Äôm close to and it helps for them as well.\n\nIt‚Äôs sort of one of many Gestalts. \nYour left brain is supposedly more logical and your right brain is more ‚Äúfeely‚Äù your left brain works the right side of your body so when your using your right side of your body your in more of a logic mode. Your right brain will be the left side of the body and be the emotional side. \n\nIf I catch myself and know I need to bring the reigns in of my emotions I first usually do inventory of what my body language is in the moment. \n\nIf my left side is enveloping the right side in every possible way ie left leg over right leg, left arm over right arm, left hand crossing over the right side of my face then it‚Äôs obvious to me that I need to adjust this problem lol. \n\n1.   So I start using the right side of my body and cease using the left as much as possible. \n2.   I may try being more animated with my right side. \n3.  Or tap with my hand or foot on the right side. \n\nI know this sounds crazy but it really works. \n\nI came up with this method for myself in my teens but I‚Äôve always been a bit interested in Gestalt psychology. So I took what simple info I had of the brain and I worked from the outside in. I didn‚Äôt pay attention to Meyers Briggs probably should have but being bilateral in those days just meant I have a brain more like a mans lmao. \n\nI used this method for performing characters in plays too I‚Äôd score the script when the character was left or right brained. Or using both. I‚Äôd score with feeling and reaction in subtext but movement was brain analysis lol. It would also build and intensify the thoughts and feelings this way. \n\n\nI don‚Äôt know if this‚Äôll help any of you in plays -\nbut as far as pulling back those reigns when you really need to I can just about guarantee you that it‚Äôll help a lot and you will get good at it. ü•∞ps don‚Äôt do this too much we love you the way you are.\n
4	(Ne) Fantasizing -> Dopamine Rush -> Total Addiction!\n\nI try to look at it as a drug addiction thinking rather than normal thoughts, and it cools me down for a bit. Especially knowing where it lead in the past.
3	You lost me at "having a conversation with someone you're interest in."
3	I need to remind myself that I will romantize ANYBODY that I take a liking to. That that is just how I am and that actually helps me. I stop being as giddy and I allow myself to just for a second romantize about everything (when I am alone) and after a while the feeling just fades off and I calm down regarding that person. \n\nI think the reality that I am like that is actually what causes me to chill down. \n\n
1	I dont know üòÖ
7	Your Thoughts on Finding Purpose?	Hey guys - I really love ENFP's. I'm dating an ENFP now, and it has changed my life.\n\nI wanted to know how you guys have thought about finding purpose in your lives? Do you have any pointers on specific careers or lifestyles that have moved the needle for you?\n\nMy SO has struggled with this. She has had some rough experiences with meaningless jobs & excessive stress. Lately it has been hard. I've tried to help without being pushy.\n\nAny help is appreciated!
11	living is the purpose.
6	As an ENFP she will struggle to find a job that will fill her meaningfully. We're just not cut out for this tech driven world. If only there were more hands on job where creativity is a necessity and we could use our people skills to help people all at the same time. \n\nPlus ENFPs hate mundane tasks and get bored of jobs extremely quickly. I would tell her to keep bouncing around from job to job til she finds a nice opportunity or something that fits her. I've had over 16 jobs and I just recently quit a job last week cause I'm not gonna sacrifice my mental well being and happiness for some random company already making millions. \n\nBut developing herself would probably be the best thing to do. ENFPs need to do a lot of growing before we hit our prime. Or I'm just projecting my problems hahahaha
3	> Do you have any pointers on specific careers or lifestyles that have moved the needle for you?\n\nI know it might sound a bit generic, but I'd reply with something like *whatever gives me enough freedom to sink my passion into*. For example, I struggled a lot (I mean, for years!) to find a decent company to work with. Now I settled with one that *throws me* into a problem with only a one directive:\n\n*solve the problem: you're free to pick the methodology/tools you think are necessary. Just respect the constraints (if any) and the deadline*\n\nthey trust me. well, not always, but they learned to appreciate my results. that's how I use the ENFP awesomeness for fun and profit ;-)
2	I am currently reading a book called 'The Quarter Life Breakthrough'  by Adam Smiley Poswolsky, that is about exactly this issue. I am also struggling in that exact same way, and it has been very helpful so far.\n\nCould be a great gift for your girlfriend!
2	The 'purpose' is going to be different for each person, and for an ENFP that could even differ by the day as well lol. My internal drive has always been towards financial freedom - once I've achieved that, I can spend my time helping others and the community around me, which is my real drive in life. Aside from that, I live my life pretty hedonistically and it seems to work pretty well.\n\nI think it boils down to a few things (but like I said, this could just be my personal perspective): Helping other people/making them happy, using her creative juices frequently, and making a difference on the world around her. If a job doesn't provide any of those she probably won't feel very fulfilled doing it!
1	I wanna be a teacher to help young minds become what they want to be.
9	Not sure if this is an N/S thing of a T/F but can anyone else immediately pick up on/ sense/ feel energies of people and predict outcomes ?	I‚Äôve always scored as an ENFP and for the most part I think it‚Äôs quiet fitting. I‚Äôm not very detail oriented or observant to what is going around me because my head is usually in the clouds and I‚Äôm thinking of something else . I also have a hard time finishing projects or even getting stared with them unless I have a lot of motivation from others and am pushed a bit . \n\nAnyways... I‚Äôm going off on a tangent. \n\nWhere i do tend to be very observant is picking up other people‚Äôs energies .... irl or text. I can just feel and see changes so easily and right away and it sends me into a spiral of analyzing ‚Äúwhy‚Äù .\n\nFor example, when I got dumped by the last guy I dated, I predicted it a week before. the second he became more distant via one text, I knew it was done . I had nothing to really prove it, but I just felt it . When I saw him irl a few days later, he was trying to act normal and hadn‚Äôt dumped me by this point, but I sensed and picked up on very subtle differences and knew he was done with me. A week later... well.\n\n\nThe ex before that ... from the very beginning I had this idea I couldn‚Äôt get out of my head that he would hurt me in the worst way possible . Something did not sit right... and in the end he did hurt me very badly . No one has ever hurt me as badly as he did. \n\n\n\nWhat function is this ? Does it even have a name? 
6	Intuition. Both the common definition and the MBTI version.
6	Ne is exploration.\n\nNi is expansion.\n\nYour brain is hardwired to think in a big picture fashion. You and I recognize patterns, organize them and apply historical context. \n\nYou will do this all of your life and it will freak everyone out. Now find a way to harness your power for good.\n\nI tried to buy Microsoft before it was available, lol
1	Intuition, and I've noticed that for ENFP's it's almost like our secret weapon. I think it has something to do with the pattern-recognition aspects of our MBTI type, but I'm not 100% certain. All I know is, I can rely on it early and often and it usually doesn't lead me astray.\n\nIt doesn't have to be only 'people's energy' either - I'm a day trader, so I use this almost daily to predict all kinds of things lol
7	Sometimes I hate being prone to going all in on things	I get overly excited about things and then I get hurt when I‚Äôm let down. It‚Äôs hard to avoid that and still have excitement and fun at the same time.
2	*Fail fast and hard* means learning fast the hard way. It might hurt you during the 20s, but it's exciting, after the 30-35 you'll have a thicker skin and developed the ability to _smell_ what could make you fall like already happened. 
42	What being an ENFP with an addictive personality has taught me	I had an addictive personality since childhood.  Until I became a full blown addict in adulthood.  And had to enter recovery and start the 12 step program. \n\n\nI am learning a lot about myself. That I can't possibly hope to be well and healthy while I continue to use food, substances, spending and other people as a substitute for actually feeling my negative feelings.\n\nI have to feel my dark loneliness, sadness and anger deeply. I can't keep using addictions to ignore them anymore. \n\nAddictive things and other people can't prevent me from facing my loneliness for ever.  And in trying to escape my loneliness I can destroy myself. \n\n\nEveryone feels lonely. But we are somehow supposed to pretend we don't and ignore the fact that other people feel it too.\n\nIf we only reached out to each other and admitted "hey sometimes I am scared I am unlovable too that I will also die alone" the world would be a better place .\n\n\nDon't try to numb your loneliness. Feel it. Use it to connect to others. Your heart is screaming for a reason. Don't ignore it anymore. 
11	This is true. Learning the H.A.L.T. method was interesting. Asking if I'm Hungry, Angry, Lonely, or Tired when I feel a craving really shed light on how subversive and devious the addiction can be. It makes you think other normal, healthy cravings you have are actually for that addiction.\n\nHave you heard of the rat Disney World experiment? They got rats addicted to heroine or cocaine (I can't remember) then put some in one cage and some in another. Each cage had a drinking bottle with a liquid dilution of the drug they could drink. But one cage had nothing else besides food and water. The other however, was a rat theme park. It was full of tons of toys and treats and everything a rat could love and enjoy everywhere. They found that the rats in the bare cage were still addicted but that the ones in Rat Funland did not go for the drug at all.
6	Yeah, i totally feel that. i've taken a really roundabout way to discover my addictions, but dealing with them has taught me a load of lessons and freed me to create deeper and more meaningful connections with friends. As you said, the addictions help numb people to the loneliness of existence, an existence we all share. Once i substituted real human connection for whatever I was using, its made a world of difference. 
5	I hate that honest, authentic, meaningful posts like these tend to get buried under disingenuous, shallow posts on this subreddit. What you've said is absolutely right, and people need to hear it, too. It's so easy to become lost in an echo chamber of your own desire to be content. I've never had a legitimate addiction (I'm only 15, might happen in the future lol), but I can relate to overeating or undereating or watching too much YouTube or listening to too much music to try to escape feelings of loneliness and paranoia. Everything has to be given its time and place because if its not, it will take it by force, and what couldn't be controlled will begin to control you.
2	I feel this. Sometimes, the emotions seem like too much and we need a way to numb them or push them down. Eventually, it becomes a habit.\n\nThanks for this advice. I have this saved.\n\nSometimes I feel like I've messed everything up and that I'll never be a good person. I feel guilt for not trying very hard when my parents think the world of me. I pushed away the love of my life by not being mature.
2	I understand the struggle. I think a problem is we get overwhelmed with what we consider as urgent needs but really aren‚Äôt that important of stuff. \n\nWe focus on short term highs because long term goals seem impossible or pointless. \n\nIt‚Äôs because truly working on yourself is hard, painful work whereas other things are fun, easily accomplished, and when you‚Äôre prone to love EVERYTHING it‚Äôs hard to do the things that suck. \n\nGood luck on your journey, friend. I really do believe in you. Admitting your own weaknesses is the first step to overcoming them.  
2	Thank you for this. I'm in a long distance relationship and there's times when I feel so alone and turned to addictive things to try and forget the world for a while. I don't want to keep running from my emotions anymore. I wish people were more open, but I guess it would help if I weren't so afraid to be open either. 
1	Thank you for sharing this, I needed to read this today. I wish you all the best, sending all my love and positivity!
47	To everyone asking where they can find an ENFP	It‚Äôs the one dancing on the pole while talking about world history.\n\nIf this doesn‚Äôt work, host a competition for most unfinished novels and you‚Äôll catch one.
29	The one who ends up in the middle of everything because they're having fun, then wonders how they got there and freaks out.\n\nBut yeah, most unfinished novels is probably the most quantifiable way of recognizing one of us. 
14	The first ones to the dance floor.
15	I feel personally attacked by that unfinished novel statement. Lol
9	This post makes me feel so lucky to have my ENFP gf. Makes me think about what if I had never met her...üò©
10	I (ab)use the üï∫ and üòé emojis everywhere. But no one knows how many books (and dead software projects) I have left unfinished.
8	Most unfinished novels made me cackle with laughter - my resolution was to try and finish books I start and it‚Äôs already not going well üòÇ
7	I‚Äôve created 200 songs... that I still have to finish. Classic ENFP 
3	I don‚Äôt want to finish some books because that would be one less world I can escape to ü§ì
2	This has been me in the past 
1	Most unfinished novels ... Sounds like The Doctor talking to Amy for the last time.
6	It's Too Excited Tuesday!	\nCAN I GET A HELL YEAH?! It's Too Excited Tuesday! Unleash the happy!\n\nWhat makes you excited? :D\n
2	I‚Äôm very excited today. Lots of exclamation points. I don‚Äôt understand it!
12	My INTP friend just invited me to a 10 silent medication retreat.. I really think it be a good experience, but not being able to talk for 10 days or befriend new people I meet sounds insanely difficult	I‚Äôve tried to meditate a few times and I just end up getting sidetracked and thinking of other things rather than being able to clear my mind. I know it takes practice , I guess I need to put more effort and FOCUS (ugh) into it.\n\nAnyways, my friend came back from a 10 day retreat and he said it was the hardest thing he‚Äôs ever done, but the most rewarding and that he highly recommends it. \n\nHe‚Äôs an INTP, and a bit on the quiet side , pretty  neurotic and overly analytical like me, but  as an ENFP , I love to talk to people and I‚Äôm the type to go to a new place and make connections pretty fast . So being around a group of people that I can‚Äôt talk to or connect with, but will be around for 10 days, is going to be really really hard .\n\nHe said on the last night , we are allowed to talk to each other about the experience. \n\nAhh I‚Äôm excited ! But,nervous and this is definitely going to test my abilities. I have a hard time really letting go and enjoying the moment for what it is. 
3	Omgosh this would be amazing. I envy you, seriously. I went 5 days without verbally speaking to people and it was so hard, but amazing at the same time. I have not been more aware of myself....except when I was falling from a plane. Seriously though, that last day is going to be one of the most beautiful things you will ever paint about.
3	You can communicate without talking. Wink a lot at people.
2	Op, shall we call you Maria...giggle. Have fun and please post when you return. You make me laugh!\n\n[https://youtu.be/yYvyh3IIdDk](https://youtu.be/yYvyh3IIdDk)
2	ENFP Challenge: Make everyone love you without saying anything.\n\nBecause if you‚Äôre allowed to speak, it would be too easy.
1	I've actually done a 10-day Vipassana silent meditation retreat and I agree that it's one of the most challenging and rewarding things I've ever done. \n\nI think everybody should do it, tbh. 
1	Sounds horrible.  If he's an intp and it's the hardest thing he's ever done.. just think of us lol. \n\nDo you get a reward afterwards? Can you be around other people like walking through a town or something? \n\n&#x200B;
1	I couldn‚Äôt do it, I get so much knowledge and life experience when I engage with people. Bouncing ideas off each other, asking questions, swapping stories, etc. I definitely value some quiet reflection time but 10 days would be torture! That said... if you go, I hope you enjoy it and get something valuable from the experience! 
1	>I‚Äôve tried to meditate a few times and I just end up getting sidetracked and thinking of other things rather than being able to clear my mind. I know it takes practice , I guess I need to put more effort and FOCUS (ugh) into it.\n\nBut meditation is not about clearing the mind.  That is just a sterotype that western culture has based on people who have not learn the various different forms of meditations yet.\n\nBuddhism form of meditation (skips explaining how there are actually many different types of buddhist meditations for I am trying to be brief and not an INTJ encyclopedia.)  Is about learning how the mind creates "formations" / "heaps" / "aggregates" / Skandha such as these 5 categories.\n\n* 1) "form" or "matter" (Skt., PƒÅli ‡§∞‡•Ç‡§™ r≈´pa; Tib. gzugs): matter, body or "material form" of a being or any existence. Buddhist texts state rupa of any person, sentient being and object to be composed of four basic elements or forces: earth (solidity), water (cohesion), fire (heat) and wind (motion).\n\n* 2) "sensation" or "feeling" (Skt., PƒÅli ‡§µ‡•á‡§¶‡§®‡§æ vedanƒÅ; Tib. tshor-ba): sensory experience of an object. It is either pleasant, unpleasant or neutral.\n\n* 3) "discrimination" (Skt. ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ sa·πÉj√±ƒÅ, PƒÅli ‡§∏‡§û‡•ç‡§û‡§æ sa√±√±ƒÅ, Tib. 'du-shes): sensory and mental process that registers, recognizes and labels (for instance, the shape of a tree, color green, emotion of fear).\n\n* 4) "mental formations" (Skt. ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞ sa·πÉskƒÅra, PƒÅli ‡§∏‡§ô‡•ç‡§ñ‡§æ‡§∞ sa·πÖkhƒÅra, Tib. 'du-byed): '"constructing activities", "conditioned things", "volition", "karmic activities"; all types of mental imprints and conditioning triggered by an object. Includes any process that makes a person initiate action or act.\n\n* 5) "consciousness" (Skt. ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§® vij√±ƒÅna, PƒÅli ‡§µ‡§ø‡§û‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§£ vi√±√±ƒÅ·πáa, Tib. rnam-par-shes-pa): "discrimination" or "discernment". Awareness of an object and discrimination of its components and aspects, and is of six types, states Peter Harvey. The Buddhist literature discusses this skandha as,\n\n * In the Nikayas/ƒÄgamas: cognizance, that which discerns.\n\n * In the Abhidhamma: a series of rapidly changing interconnected discrete acts of cognizance.\n\n * In some Mahayana sources: the base that supports all experience.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Let me not answer your question directly but in a circular way I will answer it.***  Let me instead tell a story.\n\nDo you know in language we often have problems explaining the differences between colors of blue and green until recently in most languages?  That is because blue and green are hard colors to recreate via dies and so on, even though in modern chemistry since the 1800s this is no longer a problem.  Blue existed prior to 1800, and green existed prior to 1800 but since it was harder for mankind to create blue colors and man to create green colors we had a lot less words for green and blue and the hundrends of shades of green and blue.\n\n* 1) The form of green and blue always existed.\n\n* 2) Shades of Green and Blue were always pretty, neutral, or ugly.\n\n* 3) We could always try to describe the color sky (which is ***mostly*** blue) but we would have to discriminate in our mind and think how the color sky is different than the color ocean.\n\n* 4) So to help discriminate we "name things."  We create mental form for the color of blue like sky which is different than blue like ocean which is different than blue like flower.\n\n* 5) These different names help us be aware of what things are, but it is also an ILLUSION, a Maya, a Magic where we are not really dealing with reality when we name things but instead an approximation of reality.  When we say blue like the color of the sky which day of sky, which moment in time are we talking about?  Is the mind of blue in my memory the actual memory or instead an approximation?  Is it a mind trick?  Furthermore a person who saw the same sky as me but from a different angle is he seeing the same blue?  What happens if he has red / green colorblind (such as myself / Roland00 / Matthew where I have problems  distinguishing between reds, greens, browns and oranges. They also commonly confuse different types of blue and purple hues.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow it is time to do a true mind fuck (sorry for the length.)\n\nThere is something called the **SHADOW ILLUSION.** Links to wikipedia and a picture which is going to trick your mind.\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checker_shadow_illusion\n\nA and B in the image are the same colors.  But the nearby grid, plus the shadow of the cylinder causes the mind to think that A and B are different colors for our mind does not see A and B directly but instead sees A and B via comparison of the other things we see and we mentally shift the colors in our mind and we can not turn it off and thus we see the color B incorrectly due to the shadow illusion.  Here is another example.\n\n* https://twitter.com/HumansOfLate/status/1070556912733863936\n\nSo much of language and reality is doing very similar things that I just demonstrated with these color illusions.  So much of reality is like this, if you never saw a bobcat before but you saw housecats you would think a bobcat is a form of housecat even though it very much is not.  If you met a person who is scowling while standing in line this mental formation will influence how you think about this person for you have no context and thus when you have no information even the wierd information of him scowling will influence how you think about him.  All humans judge books by their covers when we have nothing else to go on, these silent mediation retreats are meant to teach you to also have another voice in your head to do these 4 things as well 1) loving-kindness / benevolence 2) compassion 3) empathetic joy 4) equanimity ^(now this word is hard to describe its meaning but this reply is way too long already.)\n\nHumans do to how our brains work try to force labels onto things that we are already familiar with, that we are already cognizant of, to notice patterns even if we do not realize we are noticing the incorrect pattern to name something.  These meditations are not meant to quiet the mind and make it quiet, but instead to do the opposite instill many voices in your mind and not to let specific voices to be too loud / take control of your internal director and dominate the other voices in your head.  It is to make certain voices be louder and other voices to be more quiet and to listen once and a while.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMeditation is not about quieting the mind.  It is instead the opposite.  It is about doing mind tricks to illustrate that your mind is often wrong and what you think is insight can be mental misdirection, and this in turn can open up a better classification and better knowledge and better understanding.\n\nFrom Calm meditation (≈õamatha) we move onto Insight meditation (vipassanƒÅ) practice enough Insight meditation and you can invoke the "great doubt" and from the "great doubt" (where you realize you know ***nothing***) you can now achieve a "great awakening" and a deeper knowledge and understanding that what you knew before, but this process never ends, and it will never stop.\n\nBut you can't achieve the great doubt before you learn the more basic meditations of "Calm" meditation, and then practice "Insight" meditation.  And even when you attempt insight mediation you always practice calm meditation first and you shift into insight meditation after you are a little more calm.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#Here let me quote an ENFP to TLDR\n\n>Meditation is not the absence of thought.\n\n>It is the acceptance of thought, combined with a temporary, intentional detachment from it.\n\n>Understanding this was what made me capable of integrating meditation into my routine after YEARS of failing. The point isn't to quiet the mind.\n\n>The point is to recognize that the loud, constant internal chatter is not the entirety of it.\n\n>Understanding this was what made me capable of integrating meditation into my routine after YEARS of failing.\n\n>The point isn't to quiet the mind.

6	This song is not new, but I recently rediscovered it. There is so much that screams ENFP to me: the enthusiasm, the dancing, the optimism, the job dissatisfaction, EVERYTHING. I just want to dance and sing along every time!	
59	Drudging through this winter, finding my seasonal depression especially hard	Feeling like Ron Swanson and grumpy towards everything. Bad moods suck.
11	Is there any chance you could take a short trip to someplace warmer?\n\nIf not try hanging out with some friends, part of the reason SAD affects so many people is because people stop hanging out as much in the winter. 
10	25 years ago, when I was around 17yo, I decided to go to a psychologist to talk about my *casual depression*. After 3-4 meetings, he told me a very simple but effective (at least for me) truth:\n\nImagine your heart like a box that contains several feelings and moods (from happy to sad ones). Your brain picks one, and that will stick or influence your mood. Try to deliberately pick the good ones and leave out the worsts.\n\nAt the beginning I was a bit skeptical, but I tried anyway. Well, it worked after some internal effort.\nTry to do something that usually gives you relax and pleasure, but don‚Äôt stick with it, rotate your interests to something else, just to keep things interesting.\nAlso, it helped me a lot to keep a daily log on paper. When you re-read what you wrote some week, month or year before it might embarrass a bit, but then you can realize how much you got forward ;-)\n\nMy 2cents
9	I track mine through the month in a line graph because it has proven to my brain that feelings pass and are sometimes just responses to reality without BEING reality. It's an upward slog, but it helps. üôÇ\nYou're on the downhill of the season, hang in there!
6	SUN LAMP!!!! My dad got me one Christmas 2017 and it‚Äôs made these last two winters the most productive I‚Äôve ever had ‚òÄÔ∏è
3	Get your vitamin d checked. I suffer from SAD as well, & I notice a significant difference when my levels are low.
3	Yea but you'll get stuck on doing something for a bit and by the time you're feeling better again you won't even remember life could be so shitty in the first place! 
3	aye. \n\nI'm sick (40C fever), my pregnant wife is mad at me because I'm sick and thus can't help around the house and according to a recent blood test(which I'll need to redo) my vitamin D levels are ridiculously low. winter sucks\n\nbut tomorrow is another day. Allons!
3	I‚Äôve been tracking my daily moods this year on a 7 point scale because New Year‚Äôs Day was awful and I would ranked it at a 1, I‚Äôve noticed that even though there have been a couple 2 or 3 days in the mix, being more mindful of how I spend my days and my moods throughout has led me to have 6s despite the shitty winter season. 
3	Sorry to hear that dawg. Vitamin d, exercise, staying away from booze and hydrating keep me in the game mostly. Know sometimes is a little tougher than that though
3	It hit me really hard this year too. It overstayed its welcome 
3	Hey I‚Äôm an INFJ, but I recently posted in my sub about my fucked up sleep cycle as a result of my overwhelmingly shitty life circumstances/general depression. And you know us INFJs - I got some really heartfelt and constructive advice that you might be able to use. After all ENFPs an INFJs are considered by a lot of people to be the most compatible, so maybe it‚Äôll help you too? Maybe.\n\nThat aside, I‚Äôm sorry to hear you‚Äôre in this state right now. ENFPs have so much to offer the world, I really love you guys, and I don‚Äôt like hearing that you‚Äôre sad. \n\nHere are some things that I do/have suggested to other ENFP friends that are down in the dumps:\n- call an old friend you haven‚Äôt heard from in a while to catch up\n- go for a walk outside and get some sun. I prefer a nature walk without human created noise, but maybe you‚Äôd prefer a stroll in your downtown around people\n- buy yourself a nice coffee or beer and sit for a while. This is my favorite thing. Sooner or later someone will say hello and before I know it I‚Äôm having a deep conversation with a stranger and I think that shit is cool\n\nFeel free to send me a message if you need someone to talk to. 
3	Yeah, I feel you. I have a lot of.... not necessarily bad, but rather intense memories in fall and winter. That cold smell in the air... it brings me back to places that I just want to leave in the past. I'm over those people, those places, and I just want to go forward.\n\n\nBut, life keeps bringing me back to those situations with new people and new places.\n\n\nRegardless, I've learned to give up control. I accept what I've done and what's been done to me. I've learned from my mistakes, and the universe will give a million tests to learn and grow. This winter, for both you and I, is another chance to try and enjoy the cozy blankets and hot chocolates. Our mind may try and drag us to depths of our depression, and well, that's okay. It happens. It's okay to feel sad and mourn the times passed, but it'll all make sense someday: we'll learn how to let go. Look onward if you can. In the mean time, just remember: this too shall pass.
2	I second the comment about checking your vitamin D! I also have SAD I use one of those sunlamps everyday. They are not super expensive. If you can pick one up, it's made a HUGE difference for me. All the best man (because clearly there are no women on the interwebs ;)), SAD is no fun! 
2	Had a tough January, low mood hit me hard. Bought vitamin D, did a lot of chores around the house and had the frist good day of this year. Find someone to vent, clean up and do some small tasks that will make you feel accomplished. Works wonders.
1	Same here! This winter has been especially hard for me. 6 more weeks of spring!!! Let‚Äôs get through it together y‚Äôall! 
1	Here are solutions that can make all the difference. Try all of them together for full effect.\n\n1. Get out in the sunlight for 30 minutes a day. Even in winter there are often sunny moments and especially if the snow reflects the sun. Don't wear a hat and try to get the sunlight in your forehead . \n\n2. Cold showers. Start warm and really heat your body up until it feels uncomfortable. Then switch to cold and enjoy the cold for 3-5 minutes. (You can build yourself up to that ).\n\n3. Eat healthy try seasonal food and happy food like hot chocolate.\n\n4. Meditate for 15 minutes a day.\n\n5. Work out. Physical activity releases hormones that will make you feel better and counteract the negative cycle you're in. \n\n6. Take time to really go deep into your mood. Accept it, experience it and take it as far as crying. Then analyze it and find the reasons and origins for it. \nThere are ALWAYS reasons for your feelings. You just have to find which mechanism is at work to create them. 
1	Summer gives me seasonal depression. I usually pick up other activities, but I often loose contact with some of my peers for that period and it really makes me feel lonely, even if I am otherwise happy.
1	I started buying tanning packages during the winter. \n\nI eat plantbased and supplement with 5,000 mg of VitaminD3 each day\n\nI go outside at noon everyday no matter the weather and take my shirt off once in a while even during the winter.\n\nI started practicing the wim hoff method and it really helps.
1	VITA üëè MIN  üëè  D3 üëè 
1	Watch some Marx Brothers. The earliest ones are by far the most beautiful chaos, held together with only the most vague sliver of a plot. Soo sexy! Just humorous banter shoved in your ear holes for over a hour.  "Animal Crackers" always gives me a laugh boner. 
3	What‚Äôs the easiest way to open up to people?	I‚Äôm going through a tough time and I know my friends want to help but I guess it‚Äôs just hard for me to open up to people.
17	Don't get into it so seriously. They are you friend. Be friendly. Loose. "Hey, man, what's up? You good? I'm not. Lol. No but seriously my shit's all fucked up to poo. Can I tell you some shit without judgment and maybe some advice? Cause shit be crazy round here."
5	It really depends on what you share and how they will react to your sharing. Don't make a big announcement, just let little pieces of yourself test the waters first. *Act Interested* in their own experiences along the way.\n\nIntuitives will understand your thought process and your reflections. They are happy to discuss ideas, theory, and the philosophy of your issues.\n\nINTJ's will offer solutions. Sensors will tell you how they Se things should be done.\n\nSome people will want to discuss your feelings. Some people will make a joke. Some people will blame you.\n\nJust remember that you will feel better for venting or opening up but you will also review each conversation a thousand times in your head. What will they remember that you are comfortable knowing they remember and what will give you shame shivers?\n\n We embarrass easily and our self-image is delicate. Tread light and dance when you get the chance. 
1	The easiest way is just to bite your teeth and do it.
5	How to I be there for my ENFP boyfriend as his Dad is dying?	My ENFP boyfriend is at home with his family as his Dad is dying of cancer. How do I help him grieve during this time? How do ENFPs grieve? How do you generally help a significant other when they are going through a major life event? 
14	I don‚Äôt know if this an ENFP thing or a me thing but when my dad died suddenly my response was to BOTTLE. IT. UP.\n\nDo NOT let him do that. Encourage him to cry, to feel, to mourn, to celebrate his life, to look back on all the good times they had together. Be there emotionally for him. I bottled up everything and was ‚ÄòI‚Äôm fine‚Äô until I had an insane mental breakdown months later that I‚Äôm still getting over. It could have been avoided had I accepted everything was not fine, and that in itself was fine.
6	I only know for sure what I would prefer, but I think at least parts are applicable to other ENFPs.\n\nI agree that I would likely bottle a lot up, but I also know that I would want space to grieve independently. I sometimes don't open up because I don't feel comfortable in situations of pity or overly sad-type sympathy. I hate being felt sorry for. But I am also really venty, so I would likely talk to those I was close to, but I would just want to feel understood, not pitied. \n\nAnd just a note for helpful things I've done when someone is facing some kind of big trial:\n- Ask how they are. If they say they aren't good, I ask if they want to talk about it. If they do, I say I'm here to listen. If they say they don't, I say I am available to listen if/when they do feel like it. \n- If they say they are fine and I know they are lying/minimizing, I say something like, "Well, I know things can't be easy right now, so if you ever want to talk, I'm here."\n- If someone says they don't want to talk (whether or not they say they are good), I often ask "Do you want to talk about/do something else to get your mind off of things?" If something is overwhelming, sometimes it's nice to get away from it all for a while, so talking about what is going on with YOU instead or doing something fun is better than dwelling on their situation (but only once it's been firmly established that they don't want to talk).\n\n
3	My father passed about 7 years ago to cancer. I think the best thing that helped me process my emotions when I was on my road to recovery is to give myself enough time and space to make mistakes, and to lend an open ear when I ever want to have someone listen to me. I find the most value in recovery through my own emotional experiences of feeling the grief, anger, sadness, etc. If this is something you are okay with experiencing alongside with your boyfriend, I'm sure he would appreciate it
2	I personally as a ENFP have very avoiding characteristics towards greif or am in just a complete grey cloud. I would say try to find healthy ways of distracting him. Snacks, rent a movie, small trinket and just be there and listen. I wouldn't have made it through my friend OD ing if it wasn't for my BF, He let me cry and just stood by through it all. 
1	From what I can remember what I really loved about a few friends was that they respected my distance, but didn‚Äôt neglect me, as in asking how I was doing, offering to help or offering things to do for some distraction. Keep in touch, but don‚Äôt exaggerate. 
2	Do any ENFPs out there believe in astrology?	Why or why not?
4	Cancer, and I feel everything!
3	No because I'm Sagittarius and that description is straight up untrue
3	I don't, but I do appreciate things that make me reflective of my positive/ negative traits (hence MBTI), so I have dabbled. I just find astrology to be unreliable. I find myself saying, "No, that's not me at all" to most of what I see. \n\nAlso, most every horoscope I see reads like a fortune cookie. They're fun, but I don't take them seriously (although inheriting wealth from an unexpected source would be great right about now). \n\n
3	I was born at a Virgo-Leo Cusp so that explains my split personality
3	I‚Äôm not too much into it anymore, but I used to be (especially concerning my birth horoscope, which fits so well it is creepy). I‚Äôm a virgo sun, capricorn moon, virgo mercury, leo venus and sagittarius mars (my ascendant being aquarius), and it describes my varius moods so well.
3	&#x200B;\n\nyes only if you go deep to understand it. \n\nUnderstand the planets, houses, sun, moon, rising signs...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n... just knowing your sun sign... doesn't cut it. \n\n&#x200B;
2	Nooooo.  Because I believe in the Mazzaroth, that our astrological signs come from Jewish folklore which ties in with the messiah.  And astrology took that and perverted it into something different.
2	I don't really believe in astrology. I'm supposed to be an Aries, but I'm quite different from any other Aries that I know. Maybe that's the ENFP part of me.  Plus, the daily horoscopes and moon/Venus/other sign and stuff like that is like more unbelievable parts of stuff with the MBTI. It's a little far fetched and find it difficult to find a basis in reality.
1	Do you think Marilyn Monroe was an ENFP?	 Sometimes when I watch her old films, the character she often plays (the dumb blonde) reminds me of some of the traits of an ENFP. She seems very vulnerability, ditzy/air-head behavior, sweet-nature, dramatic, does silly things, submissive and has child-like behavior. People say her stage persona was an ESFP but I think an ENFP.... how do you think her personality is similar and/or different to an ENFP?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are example of her behavior:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq1HSjZUL5I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq1HSjZUL5I)
4	I'm subscribed to this and the dating over thirty sub and I thought I was seeing double lol (i don't think she is ENFP for the record, I would think ISFP)
3	An SFP of some sort is my guess
4	I think she was an Introvert at heart.\n\nTony Curtis talks about her and he tells a fascinating story. So does Laurence Olivier.\n\nHe said she never wanted to be an actress. She wanted to be a Model. \n\n[https://youtu.be/DmFL0hfLBC0](https://youtu.be/DmFL0hfLBC0)
2	Help, I think I‚Äôm in love.	Good afternoon ENFPs! So I‚Äôve been friends with an INTJ for almost a decade. I‚Äôve liked him most of the time. We only lived in the same city for a year and afterwards have never lived in the same city but whenever I am around he always makes time to spend the day with me and plans things I enjoy doing and we always keep in touch. I never want to leave when I‚Äôm around him and I‚Äôve never felt like he wants me to leave either. He is one of my best friends. I don‚Äôt know if I should tell him and possibly ruin our friendship or if I should wait around. He‚Äôs never said he likes me and I feel like if he did he would say something. We both have extremely busy lives and live pretty far away from each other. I‚Äôm pretty confused but I also don‚Äôt want to read into anything or overthink it and I also don‚Äôt want to lose my friendship with him.
7	What if he is thinking the  same thing? You never know until you take the leap.
3	INTJ here, if he likes spending time with you, that means he likes you. Tell him !
3	Hey - INTJ here - just bring it up.\n\nI would def not spend time with someone I did not like. If he hasn't said anything it could be because he can't. I find it extremely difficult to talk about feelings because when I have them at all they are deep and intense. I am married to an ENFP and she just came up to me and honestly made it easy. We can be really open and honest and I don't think he would judge you or that there is any real chance of ruining your friendship from just talking about it. If you get weird, clingy, obsessive maybe ;) but not just bringing it up. You may have to do most of the talking and just ask yes or no questions lol - we are like 3 year olds emotionally sometimes. Good luck!
2	Just be up front and tell him how you feel. He's probably clueless (we often are when it comes to social signals) and will need time to digest. Then give him space and time to think. 
1	Do you guys have opportunity to live in same city or similar life plan? I think no matter what you should think of it , before u confess. Or even start a conversation like that , ‚Äúwould u like/ show me around if I go to ur city working/ studying ?‚Äù Or like ‚Äúhow do u think of long distance etc etc‚Äù and maybe then confess to him 
4	Relationships With Parents	I have sort of rocky relationships with my parents and I've talked to a lot to other enfps who do too. Is this a thing? I haven't seen any articles on it but if you have, let me know. Anybody else relate? \n\n&#x200B;
11	We get along usually. Mine just don't understand me very well and I don't open up much with them.\n\nIn typical ENFP style (and probably most humans), we get along better when I don't live with them and I don't feel like they are trying to control me or imposing on my reflective time. 
3	INFP but yes. My whole family is made of sensors
1	I have a very good relationship with my parents. I still live with them and love them a lot.
1	My mum is an ENFP too (higher extroversion than me tho) and we‚Äôre eternally at each other‚Äôs throats. I don‚Äôt know what my dad was but he was definitely an introvert and we always got on really well with minimal arguments ever.
1	My parents don't understand me in the slightest. My dad is a very SJ narcissist. My mother is a introverted feeler who thinks she is a thinker. I have tried to explain logically why she more likely a feeler and she has gotten really mad. When she discovered Myers briggs, she took the test for my siblings and I, when were kids. Deciding that we were all introverted thinkers. She would always tell us this and constantly speak poorly of extroverts and feelers. She has an absurd prejudice against extroverts and feelers. She almost cried when I told her I was an ENFP.  She has later admitted that she always knew I was a feeler.
13	Energy management vs time management	I came across this amazing concept recently. What do you guys think about it? As an ENFP I've always struggle to manage my time. It really frustrates me and I feel really drained when I try to work according to a schedule. \nBut this concept actually amazed me. It's about managing our energy efficiently rather than managing the time. \n\n(Basically it means that we ENFP'S can work according to our own pace ;-) )
2	small, focused "todo list for the next 4-8 hours" help me a lot. I put them on paper near the keyboard, so that I can see them continuously and I remember to stay focused or at least finish  as soon as possible.
2	My energy is insane, going by a schedule is like I turn into a toddler
1	Plz elaborate.
1	This is interesting. I find that when I have high energy, I can get a lot done. It's when I start to slow down, relax and be a little lazy that my energy drops and I become a sloth. I can't get anything done, I can decide on what I should be doing and I just want to lock myself away until I can figure it all out. Definitely life is best lived when taking action but I do love relaxing and contemplating but I'm now starting to see that this drains me until I reset. 
52	It be like this to me all-the-time :)	
16	That‚Äôs why when we enter new groups we‚Äôre introverted af and just collecting data...biding our time until BOOM. \n\nAct all coy and cool just enough to create the proper grand subversive entrance then when we feel the slightest bit of safety we go awkward intense zany.

57	Anyone else get lost in the comments section of literally anything?	Facebook, youtube, reddit, etc?\n\nI find it so addicting to see others' views on the most mundane things, if they agree with me and especially if they don't agree with me. And then I find it hard to not get involved and comment at them....muahahah
13	I really like reading the comments but I rarely add to them. Sometimes I‚Äôll type out a long response only to hit the back button and never post it. \n\nCongrats your post is an exception!
8	Mee. In YT, I switch to the comment section usually about 10 seconds after the video started
3	Youtube lol
2	You have just won my **Favorite Question of the New Year. Huzzah, and Happy New Year, OP.**\n\nYes! When I was a "Little", I tried very hard to learn to read people's minds. Bewitched! I wanted to be Endora but I talked to a Samantha who was also very old.\n\n Samantha Caroline Allen was the oil portrait over our mantel. I knew she would tell me more than mundane things.\n\nOur cats, our ferrets and our 'Littles" still look up at her in wonder.\n\n I studied hypnosis hoping to convince people to share their inner self.  I read anyone and everyone's autobiographies to listen to their words. \n\nI studied astrology because that's where under the blacklights with the smell of incense, sat-in and sang out loud.\n\n I'm an INTJ Gemini...astrology is achoo but I am a Gemini. Dion y Dionysius.\n\n*Then* I discovered Reddit and YouTube. 16 personality types. Just look at the comments and we recognize our species. My homeroom is quiet and peaceful in the INTJ subreddit. We talk theory, ideas and philosophy.\n\n I visit the ENFP subreddit to say Hello to our Pooh, and Eyeores too. Your Hundred Acre woods is wonderful, Christophers or is it Pooh"s?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TDLR: 60+ plus years and nothing is as revealing as the comments on social media.**\n\n&#x200B;
1	Me too. That's way I deleted my FB, IG and YT accounts, just to not get tempted. The problem is that I still have 2 twitter accounts, LOL!
212	Meeee üòÅ	
12	This is me for any animal, especially cats and I also recently discovered I love snails
4	Me with every furry animal ever.
2	OMG me AF. Just need to replace "dog" with "any cute/cool animal" and it be me.
1	This is my face too ...This is one of the ways we so connect. Our love for animals and loving them makes us so happy. I just had to smile knowing this bond we have with animals is also our bond together. We are an animal loving ‚Äútribe ‚Äú and that‚Äôs wonderful. We get each other in a very fundamental part of ourselves that is so important to us both. It‚Äôs an extension of who we are underneath it all there is this love. I love you guys and your wonderful. I‚Äôm so glad that there are people like you in the world. You make me smile no matter where I am in my mind and heart. Just want you to know how I appreciate how special you guys are and I love the love you have for animals. It makes all the difference to me who is kind and loving to animals is the remarkable kind of friend I hold dear and with high esteem. You are remarkable .INFJ ‚ô•Ô∏èENFP
19	If someone asks what introverted feeling is like just show them this	
3	I like it. Took a little to find singer of that. Her name is Esthie.
3	Mhmm yeah. You got anymore of that melancholy / nostalgia, good shit good shit üòåüëçüèºüëåüèº
2	Great. Now how can I get this out of my head ? :D
1	Is my brain making up bad feelings?	I‚Äôll put you in context really quick: I‚Äôve had anxiety for a couple of years, I didn‚Äôt know it until six months ago. My feet, ankles and knees hurt because my feet structure is a little different from average (not noticeable by sight). I‚Äôm usually a happy person but some months ago I started feeling like shit.\nThe thing is, everything is getting better now and the other day my therapist told me that I‚Äôm okay. I see why she says that, but I can‚Äôt fully believe/accept it. I was feeling good this past days, but I don‚Äôt feel like everything is okay with me, my thoughts and my brain. I don‚Äôt fully connect with myself and I don‚Äôt feel connected with my body. Everything should be alright, but I‚Äôm all the time worried: is my brain making up excuses so that I still feel bad? Why would I want to stay like this?\nWhen I‚Äôm fine, I have a voice in my head that tells me I shouldn‚Äôt, and I should be feeling anxiety or sadness or pain or something. But then, of course, when I‚Äôm having a bad time, I just want it to stop and stay calmed.\n\nI don‚Äôt want my therapist to think that I‚Äôm just trying to prove I have something wrong going on in my brain, but at the same time, I can‚Äôt just ignore that I‚Äôm having trouble with feeling normal.\n\nI don‚Äôt know, has any of you experienced something similar?
3	If you look online you will find it is a common thing for people trying to get well. Because it is strange and new. There is comfort in the anxiety or depression. It may be bad, but it's your bad. It can feel like part of your personality. Who are you without it? It's a scary question. But you must realize anxiety is not you. Not even a part of you. It is a parasitic leech attached to you that you can kick off and still be you. A better you. A happy you.
4	Motivational Monday!	\nToday is a new day! A fresh week! An opportunity start something new and get back into life. \n\nWhat inspires you, /r/ENFP?\n\nPost stories, quotes, and images that give you life. Need a little rally? Don't be shy posting your goals; let /r/ENFP give you a pep talk!\n
1	Happy monday to all! Still no plans, I like to have open options.\n\nBut I suppose this song sounds perfectly for a monday :-)\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/4uzwT7u3nh2KgUYImrDe11?si=T1YnEs48SS2c6B8cSrLaHA
11	Rational deep down?	I oftentimes resent being characterized as ‚Äúemotional‚Äù or ‚Äúillogical‚Äù by my more straight-laced INTJ, ISTJ, etc. friends. Do I get excited and passionate about stuff? Of course. But I‚Äôm also a philosophy major and can hold my own in academic discourse. When I think of myself, I think of myself as a fairly analytical and rational person who also happens to feel a lot and enjoys people. Anybody feel this?
7	Considering we have Te it‚Äôs more that we‚Äôre rational on the exterior and emotional deep down. It‚Äôs the Ne that's the culprit for goofiness and na√Øvet√©. And Fi for making everything we do deeply personal.
4	Yeah, I posted this the other day. I found it on Pinterest (no author listed) and really relate:\n\n‚Äú...the ENFP is also that gap between the Rationals and the Idealists. Their function order NeFiTeSi means that they project a rational ‚ÄúNT‚Äù temperament to the world and NOT the so easily hurt temperament of the Idealist. Many ENFPs LOOK and ACT like NTs while maintaining an inner Idealism. Te means an ENFP can be a ruthlessly efficient machine not this procrastinator because we have ‚ÄúP‚Äù and not ‚ÄúJ.‚Äù Te gets stuff done and Si remembers what got done, remembers the past and can recall on learnt experience. \n\nSo in total the ENFP is an extremely passionate, innovative individual brimming with new ways of seeing and thinking about things. The ENFP is an Idealist who stands up for what is right and is outwardly a Rational who isn‚Äôt likely to show their emotions at all, but rather to be a high achiever, implementing strategies and getting stuff done.‚Äù
3	As an ENFP we have Te and it can be very rational. We are very interested in facts and open to new facts to learn and can change our opinions and values if we are wrong. We are not illogical or over emotional. INTJ's and ISTJ's both have Fi like  us. So they can be just as emotional sometimes. Don't let what others say get you down. You know who you are.
3	I would say that I have a very developed Te.  Credit to studying mathematics for six years and my love for understanding how and why the world works haha.
2	Oh my god, this! Like there‚Äôs nothing wrong with being more emotional than rational/logical, but I happen to be really thoughtful as well as a total ball of feelings
1	I know ENFPs are quite rational but it's behind the goofiness. I got to witness when they're most passionate about something. My previous crush is quite rational and intelligent when it comes to politics and economic. 
1	>When I think of myself, I think of myself as a fairly analytical and  rational person who also happens to feel a lot and enjoys people.  Anybody feel this?\n\nThat's because you like to think of yourself in the way you would like to be. And of course, if you are a philosophy major you must necessarily need to be rational and intellectually honest within your academic discourse, because if it isn't that way, then you are most likely incompetent.
11	Not being able to take action?	I need to know if this is a personality thing or what. I'm an ENFP and whether it's school, work, or relationships - I cannot act on plans or actions that I know are critical to me advancing. I can act on things that are on a whim, sure. Being perpetually late, knowing I need to change, and then never being able to change that about myself and losing jobs is something that is a tried and true example. I need to know if this is something we struggle with or if I need to seek alternative help.
3	at 32 yrs old I still have the same problem. 
3	I am the same. As I got older and gained more responsibilities I just had to get on with the boring essential stuff. I have a mortgage, marriage, kids, job and just have to be a grown up.\nHowever, when everything essential is done, I do what the hell I like! We need that freedom.\n\nWrite a list each morning of 3 tasks. Get them done, don't start thinking about what you'd rather do and how boring or uncomfortable the tasks are.  Don't switch on the tv or start checking reddit or allow any other distractions. Whizz through those tasks.\nWhen they're done, congratulate yourself on an excellent job and relax.\n\nI was a late person too. I had a reputation for it in my last job but people liked me so it was ok. However, i don't want that rep in my new job, so i'm going to take great pride in being the person who is always on time. \nHow I stop myself from being late:\nPreparation the night before is key. Clothes, lunch, etc sorted. It's boring, i'd rather be playing Witcher 3, but it's gotta be done.\nDo not look at your phone in the morning! You'll be reading random wiki articles before you even realise it.\nKeep checking the time. Don't guess!\nDon't go into a daydream, focus on what you need to do.\nAim to get places 10 mins early.\nHave something annoying as your alarm. I have my kids. They don't stop calling me till I get up and go see them. Haha\n\nI know how it feels, you get so disappointed with yourself. Take pride, hold your head up high. Get those crappy things done first and then have fun. \n\nBest of luck!\n\n\n
2	Yes, all ENFP's seem to struggle with these things to some degree. We like ideas. But putting them into practice isn't as fun.
2	Once you have devised the plan, JUST DONT THINK INSIDE MIND, act on it , Fool your mind by saying "Let me try that", "Lets do it for 5min" ,etc...Rinse->Repeat, increase the duration gradually & see the change ! Hope that helps ya
1	I am also in my early 30‚Äôs and I don‚Äôt think this is something I‚Äôve ever struggled seriously with to the point that I felt I had no power over my life or anything like that. But I feel like any type could struggle with these things & may not necessarily be MBTI related...\n\nEdit: Follow-up question-do you struggle to do things that you truly, TRULY want to do? Or just things that you think you ‚Äúshould‚Äù do?
1	Be honest with yourself. You just don‚Äôt care enough to change, otherwise though would.
1	i'm 20 years old and i struggle with this all the time. i'm so glad i took the mbti test, i'm so glad i'm an enfp, i'm so glad i made it into reddit and i'm so glad i found this sub full of people wanting to help eachother. just wanted to write that somewhere haha
1	Hello can you please pay me back.
4	Who are the most fantastic ENFP characters you know?	
11	Miiiiichael Scott
5	definitely aang from ATLA
5	...Who lives in a pineapple under the sea? :)
2	As mentioned Aang, Gon from HunterxHunter, and Luffy from One Piece.
2	I think the 10th Doctor Who is ENFP and I love that Doctor. I've seen things listing him as various types, ENFP, ENTP,m others. But I think he is ENFP because he is always thinking  up new ideas/seeing connections and making jokes all the time("Blimey, try to make an Ood laugh..."). But at the same time he has very strong principles and convictions he will not cross unless necessary (not using guns for example as was seen in The Doctor's Daughter "I never would!"). But he obviously is a man (Time Lord) of action with Te ("Allons-y!"). And he stores his Si memories away in his nostalgia and his comfort ("I don't want to go.").
2	Sam from Garden State  \nEllie from The Last Of Us (video game)  \nLadybird from Ladybird  \nClementine from Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind
1	Naruto.
28	How to handle romantic relationships to not get too hooked or too dreamy	Hi there!\n\n[As the 16personalities.com dictactes,](https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-relationships-dating)  ENFP people can be very devoted to relationships and this can reach the point to be complicated if the partner does not reply likewise:\n> If their partners aren‚Äôt able to reciprocate these acts of excitement and devotion, ENFPs will likely end up feeling unhappy and misunderstood.\n\nI'm in a kind of (something not official yet, not because of me, but more because of the other side) a long-distance relationship. I keep doing my own things in my daily life, but often I get distracted thinking about her and sometimes I feel a bit upset because I'm expecting that she calls me or writes me more often.\n\nHowever, at the same time, I want to respect her space, since if I'm too much on her it can be annoying for her and unhealthy for me. Also, I want to not be so dependant on our relationship because, although we are having very nice time together and I'm quite fine with the situation, nothing is set officially and I also feel that she does not want to set any fixed commitment yet.\n\nThis can be a problem when I'm trying to make plans about my/our future, I think I get too dreamy easily and this can be frustrating and treacherous. Again, here the 16personalities states it very well:\n> ENFPs constantly explore new ideas and improvements, fantasize about future possibilities ‚Äì in dating, this tendency to look at potential rather than the present can be self-defeating, and their spontaneity makes it harder to stay focused on their end goal of a long-term relationship.\n\nSo, have you ever experienced this kind of situations in relationships? how do you handle them? Do you have any suggestions for a very passionate person in romantic relationships?
13	I've experienced this with both long distance and while living with my partner and the only way I was able to keep it under control was to talk about how I was feeling with my other half.  \n\n\nOne of my relationships broke down because they couldn't find the time for me that I needed which taught me a lot, but luckily I don't have that issue at the moment as my boyfriend is there as often as I need him, despite distance.
6	[deleted]
3	I've been in 4 long-distance relationships and in a 5th. You need to be your own person and l0ove yourself and enjoy your own life. The relationship can't be everything. I read a thing once that said each part of your life should be a little ball in a wheel around you. Each should the same size. Family, work, hobbies, spiritual health, mental health, physical health, learning, etc. And relationship. It should be one of the things and the same size. It should all be a balance. Don't make a relationship grow too big or you neglect all the other things. Don't let it be everything. It isn't healthy for you or the other person.\n\nI would advise focusing on your life and trying new things and hobbies, hang with friends, etc. Enjoy the freedom that long distance brings. But I would also talk with her and tell her your feelings and work out what to do together as far as how often you talk. Don't make it an obligation. I know personally if there is an obligation to talk constantly, everyday for a long time it can be draining and feel more like work than a fun, enjoyable relationship.
2	Hey uh... Dating an ENFP here. Am I kinda screwed if she‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs distant and not me? She barely initiates wanting to see me and barely replies to my texts.
2	This really freaked me out. I am the female in a not really official relationship with an ENFP and I had to double check your username lol! Sounds just like us. ENFPs are fun and charming. Just take it slow and let the love flow :). 
2	I‚Äôm in almost the exact same situation. Except add that he has now had to leave to go to a country in Africa and I cannot get a hold of him because it seems he has either lost his phone or is without service for over a week. This has forced me to get a lot stronger on focusing on myself and what it is that I want out of MY life, regardless of relationship status. Because no one can ever take that from me. I find that the more weight I put on a relationship, the more anxiety I have. It is so so hard, but I have had to learn to ruthlessly focus on myself, my friends, my career and holding myself accountable to my own power over my life. Sometimes it feels impossible, but it‚Äôs the only way I can keep going forward without putting all my eggs in one basket, so to speak. This way, it‚Äôs easier to keep things in perspective without getting so attached to outcomes. I hope this makes sense and I honestly wish you the best because I completely understand the struggle! 
2	Currently dating an ENFP (long-distance). Tbh that's what i personally like most about my enfp. see i was so distant and kept pushing him away at first, but because he was persistent and just so genuine about his feelings i started allowing him into my private world and that was one of the happiest decisions i made so far.\n\ni think it's a matter of finding someone who shares the same vision of the world with you, because for me, i sure as hell like my partner dreamy and insane and hopelessly inlove üòÇ\n\nor maybe it's because me and my enfp is in a long-distance setup that's why i feel this crazy longingness? well üòÇ
2	I relate very much! I'm in the beginnings of a new relationship nowadays, and I'm trying hard not to jinx anything, but it's the first time in a long while that I've been feeling this positive about someone. My cheeks hurt because I can hardly stop smiling around them. And after all the rubbish I've had to deal with, that is a somewhat scary realisation - I'm scared of losing it before it's even truly begun!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll in all I suppose I'm trying to deal by keeping a busy schedule, including lots of plans with friends and different people every evening. His schedule is also rather packed all week. To be fair, I'm not yet convinced that he's not the more "clingy" person out of the two of us - I've legit got my fingers crossed that he is! It would make things all the easier for me. :') He's thankfully often suggesting things we could do together, even going as far as dreaming up trips to take together.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n... You know, maybe I've landed myself a fellow ENFP. I should let him take a test sometime!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut to stick to the problem at hand, dividing your time makes a huge difference. And figuring out how your partner expresses their feelings, then responding in kind. And to be perfectly fair, if you feel you have to constantly hold back, maybe the relationship isn't entirely right for you. But it's always worth a wait: sometimes these intense feelings die down and you can find a balance you're both happy with!
1	Hi fellows!\n\nFirst of all, thank you all for your answers. They were very helpful, really!\n\nMy partner took the test and, guess what, she got ENFP!! (well, she's ENFP-A and I'm ENFP-T, according to [http://16personalities.com/](http://16personalities.com/))\n\nThis is nice, in one hand, because I think this is a good match; On the other hand, however, I'm thinking that feeling like I am the passionate one and the planner one could indicate something.\n\n....Or maybe I'm worrying too much. For the time being, she loves me and I strongly appreciate that, so I'll try to stick on that and follow your suggestions \^\_\^
1	Hey! Im in the same boat, my girlfriend is a INTP and I think it's really hard for us ENFP when we talk about our wants or expectations in the relationship. I don't know if you are the same as me, where I do wish my girlfriend would agree with me on some romantic date ideas and praise me for my great ideas. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think its easy for us to get carry away because we are dreaming about our wants and desire instead of sprinkling in a bit of reality where we don't think too much about the other person's perspective.Also when we do I don't think we can think exactly like them to the point where we can predict their thoughts and action.  When we do bring up the romantic idea, of course we think about the other person's schedule but we forget they also have challenges they face everyday which they might not easily postpone for us and our relationship. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs ENFP I'm not sure if we are all alike as a whole but I would suggest reading a book to let our imagination run wild or write stories. I have not been able to stop myself from thinking about my girlfriend everyday and worrying about her. From their perspective you are right, it can be annoying and clingy but in the end I don't think we can fully fix it but instead focus our energy on something else we are passionate besides our other half.    \n\n\nLet me know if you have any suggestions because i'm still trying to figure it all out as well. 
433	Still the most ENFP thing ive read in my life	
72	Like honestly...I jump from life of the party goofy ass dancing to any song with a beat to ‚Äúlife is meaningless and there is no God‚Äù within about .5 seconds and there is zero middle ground 
30	I‚Äôm so amazed at how well being an ENFP matches my personality and that there are so many others just like me. 
22	Just come into the darkness with me
7	I love the fact that it‚Äòs Matthew Gray Gubler. 
4	/r/MeIRL
3	totally read this to the tune of Alanis Morsette's "Hand in My Pocket"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nquite catchy
3	Is he an ENFP?
2	Lol right now it's like the hello kitty skate made me fall on my face into the darknessüòÇ
2	I read this in Alanis Morissettes singing voice. Lol
2	üòÇüòÇüòÇ my gf has a hello kitty tattoo. She‚Äôs an ENFP. 
1	I feel like I'm fully in the hello kitty roller skate side, god I love hello kitty...
1	God...I love us
5	I wish that I were an INTJ right about now.	My life has been completely destabilized for the second time in a year. Right as I got my life back on track, & saw the light at the end of the tunnel life just knocks me out again. I am so over emotional I look like I just stepped out of a boxing ring with two black eyes. I though I had no more tears left to cry but life found some more.\n\nI envy the logical & reasonable mind right about now. 
4	Hii , dont worry , you are stronger than the problems in your life. Hang in there. Keep fighting . Start with end in mind\n\ndo u need help from INTJ ? Though i think we have more degree of innate ability to strip off emotions & focus our mind in a logical , rational way still i think some of the ways/shortcuts of us might help you excel in controlling the over emotional mind you mentioned.\n\n&#x200B;
5	INTJ's also feel a lot and can be overwhelmed by emotion and sadness. Just like anybody. Everyone feels, everyone thinks, everyone senses, everyone intuits. In fact they have Fi just like us but one lower. And we have Te just like them too. We can be very rational. But rationality doesn't make emotions go away, especially if they are strong.\n\nJust look forward. Tomorrow could be the greatest day of your life, you don't know. Be optimistic. Life goes on. Time heals all wounds. It may not seem like it but it does. With perspective comes learning. You will be okay. Everything will be alright, no matter your type.
3	Labels don‚Äôt define you. 
3	Hey buddy, its not bright over here at the INTJ gang, we are very emotionnal even tho we look cold and careless.\nEverybody loves you ENFP cunts, I too would like to be more animated, sociable and enjoyed by other people, but we can't have everything can we. (I'm bad at being emphatic but I hope you'll get better). Just be yourself you lovely bastard.
1	hahaha, can an INTJ  provide some help for u? 
1	Yeah, no. 
1	INTJ here. Have I ruined my friendship with my ENFP friend?	Hi all, INTJ female here posting from a throwaway due to the sensitive nature of this.\n\n\nFirst some background. I met this ENFP guy about 2 years ago and we only rarely saw each other in a semi-work setting. But we became close about a year ago when randomly in a conversation we discovered we shared lots of the same interests. \n\n\nWe no longer work together and it has developed into what I would consider a very close friendship. He's always extremely animated around me and shares both his passions and his frustrations with me. We have so many hobbies and passions in common it's not funny. He even brought me into the inner circle to be a key member of his team on a critical project he was working on. That project is over now and was unfortunately unsuccessful but he's got a follow up idea he is working on with "more details to come" and seems to be hinting that he wants me involved again. We constantly talk about how neither of us have #nofilter with each other and how we can be so up front with each other.\n\nThere's just one problem. I gradually became aware of the fact that I was attracted to this man. Love? Certainly as a friend, hard to tell if it goes that far on a romantic front. I didn't tell him for ages for various reasons - timing, I thought it would go away, and fear of ruining things. There's also the fact we are both married with young families.\n\n\nSo I messaged him finally to tell him how I felt. I said that my only motivation for doing so was to clear my conscience and help clear my head. I made it clear that all I wanted was to continue our friendship, nothing more. I wouldn't want to do that to his family or mine. I said I had learned to mostly ignore it so that it doesn't get in the way of our friendship. But I felt I wasn't being genuine to him by not telling him.\n\n\nSo now I sit and wait patiently for his response. He's messaged to say he needs time to process. I've assured him to take all the time he needs. It's been 3 days so far, and my INTJ brain is going into overdrive figuring out how its all going to go wrong. As for me I have accepted that I have these feelings and that, had fate and circumstance been different we may have been together.\n\n\nSo Im looking for some insight. How would you react if you were in his situation? What should I be doing or not be doing right now to ensure this is as painless as it can be?\n\n\nTldr : told my best friend I was attracted to him but didnt want to do anything about it due to our life circumstances. Still want to be friends. Worried Ive ruined everything.
7	Honestly, if it were me, I‚Äôd have wished that you had never shared because I might feel as though I was putting my marriage/family life at risk by remaining friends with you. What do you expect him to do with this knowledge? I think now it is just an excruciatingly uncomfortable situation.  \n\nEdit: as for what you should do now...I think just back off of the situation and don‚Äôt do or say anything else unless he responds. 
5	If I was in the situation I would have wanted you to keep it to yourself.  Now what am I suppose to do with that information? Putting myself in his shoes, I'm married and wouldnt expect my wife to be ok with me continuing a relationship like that. I would also feel mildly frustrated because this kind of thing happens more often than i care to admit when it is not our (ENFPs) intentions. I hope I'm wrong but I think it might put some kind of strain on your friendship moving forward. \n\nI would give him some space for a bit and maybe check in about whatever project he wanted help on in a few days. I wouldnt bring it up again if he doesnt.
3	Uhh... telling him makes it this weird little secret between you and him, which would likely result in  additional weirdness. Although additional weirdness would likely result from letting spouses know, it would be workable and appropriate boundaries could be put into place. 
3	Bad timing and medium.\n\nTelling something like that to someone should have been done live, face to face, not via text/email/phone call. That would give you the opportunity to explain and articulate. Maybe it's harder, but is way more effective.\n\nGive him some time and space, maybe he just needs to elaborate.
2	As an enfp, here's what I would do:\n\n1) tell you I need some time to porcess.\n\n2) take that time, which would probably be a while. think weeks or months. \n\n3) be your friend again!! I LOVE intjs, and infjs. you both are just awsome
2	Don't listen to the others posting here. \n\nThe truth will always bring the best outcome. It's fair of you to let him know because he can better see how the dynamics of your relationship works. And it's good so that he won't put you in awkward situations. \n\nIf he is mature he will be able to see the truth, the fact that your both Ian relationship and that you don't have to act on the romantic feelings between you, and have to be careful to not overstep boundaries and in effect be unfair to your partners. \n\nIf you handle everything right you can still be friends . 
1	Not INTJ, I'm an INFP.\n\nBut I had a similar situation in life.\n\nI asked a guy if he was flirting with me because of things he said to me over email. I did ask him over email because it was a long distance situation... He didn't like me and stopped replying to my emails afterwards. That or just be very avoidant with me and canceled a meet up we'd been planning months at that point.\n\nI haven't spoken with him in over a year now. I dunno, I sometimes want to but I feel it'd be the same garbage, just me initiating and him barely caring. \n\nI probably ruined things but I felt similar to you, that I can't pretend everything is okay. I was honest and sincere because my conscience wasn't letting me ignore the confusion I was going through.\n\nI personally feel that a truth spoken is better than pretending everything is okay. Not everyone agrees with that but I'm a crybaby myself; I'd rather cry about a hard truth than a falsehood that I later found out was a falsehood.
2	How do you all consolidate your creative energy on ONE or a few projects instead of having it bounce off a thousand things?	
2	Try reallllly hard to channel the Fi. Which projects are the most meaningful to YOU? Once you figure that out, it‚Äôs easier to let the other ones go.  
2	‚ÄúIf I really cared about that thing I would‚Äôve done it already. Intention is meaningless. Action is everything. All hail Te üôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è!‚Äù
1	Try taking the one project apart in your head- think of the different parts of the idea that you need to focus on to make it happen, and instead of thinking of it as 1 big idea, think of it as a lot of smaller ideas that are all gonna come together like a voltron robot.
1	Put all the things on a paper, make a list. Highlight the ones you think are more important/urgent and remove the others. Repeat the process until you're ok with the remaining ones.\n\nWhen I'm in doubt about something, I just do this. It helps me bringing clarity on priorities.
1	I have a project manager.
1	On learning and cognitive functions	All my life I've been praised as an insanely fast learner when I first start anything, only to become disappointing later as I fail to consolidate on early gains. I've come to some insights through my cognitive functions that appears to explain this pattern and perhaps offers a way out. I'm wondering if this would resonate with other ENFPs.\n\nOur primary function, the one that we are most comfortable with and most easily puts us in a flow state, is Ne (extraverted iNtuition). No wonder we love tackling a new subject, and with that ease with exploration comes rapid growth. As we learn, we eagerly apply our tertiary function of Te (extraverted Thinking). We bypass our auxiliary Fi (introverted feeling) and ignore our inferior Si (introverted Sensing) because as extroverts we are not as much at ease with introverted functions. So we keep getting high on Ne and Te, creating what is known as looping. Explore and apply, explore and apply. But there is no sound foundation for all that learning to rest on so eventually the whole edifice falls like a house of cards. For instance, for a while I really got into the adobe programs, edited my own videos, made little animations. Quite sophisticated things. Somehow, I don't remember how to do any of this.\n\nThe real way to level up, I realize now, is to take the time to engage my Fi and my Si. I've really done this with my guitar playing. Dialing into music that truly resonate with me on a soul level rather than learning a bunch of covers crappily. Learning that piece off by heart and making a ritual out of playing a couple of bars slowly as I can stand it at a time to smooth out each transition. When I play a piece complete out of that Fi-Si place it sounds completely different. \n\nI now believe the balanced engagement of all 4 of our cognitive functions is necessary for best results in learning. But while it is easy to run away with Ne and Te, it takes a lot of mindfulness to engage with Fi and Si. But those functions are right there in our stack and we can tap into them if we take the right attitude. Dial into what it is that truly make you passionate about your subject. Take the time to sink into sense memory. There will be times where you spin off into wildly exploratory learning and that's ok. But when that period comes to an end, remind yourself to consolidate. In Chinese the word for practicing literally means "rewarm your habit". Try to feel the gentle temperature increase in your heart as you refamiliarize yourself with something you've learned and forgotten. Remind yourself to be in your body and cherish every movement. \n\nThe above is theory that I've only recently put to the test. I'm excited to share it with you and if you get anything from it.
3	Yah. We are creatures of meaning above all else. I repeat this often but it was once told to me to maximize your learning have 1)someone to look up to 2) someone to compete with 3) someone to teach. I too realized I‚Äôm not a learner in solitude. The fulfillment that comes from those personal relationships is usually the fuel that keeps me progressing at a good and unformed linearity. 
2	Thank you, this is some great advice ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ú®. As much as I‚Äôm interested in different Topics, I also find that I learn more enrichingly when learning with the heart (Fi-Si), rather than the mind (Ne-Te)
1	Can an ENFP enjoy maths?	Hi guys, this is my first post over here and I want to ask you some questions. üòä\n\nFirst of all, I‚Äôm pretty certain that I am an ENFP-T, and finally typing myself as such felt like a relief, as I felt reminded of who I really are as a child (and who I still truly am today, although I tend to forget this sometimes).\n\nHowever, since I got into elementary school (I finished High School last year), my way of thinking and my way of addressing people didn‚Äôt get good reactions from my peers, resulting in me starting to express myself in an unnatural, more ‚Äúsocially fitting‚Äù manner, and closing off a little (the reason why I always believed myself to be an introvert).\n\nI was tested as gifted in kindergarten, as I was generally interested in numerous subjects and taught things like reading to myself at age three out of interest. I assume that due to this, I always felt special and kind if superior to others at an early age, and my grades proved so.\n\nAs I got into the later years if school, however, the other kids started to catch up, and I felt useless, as society implemented the feeling of having to be a groundbreaking scientist in order to feel worthy into me. As at this point, I started to feel that I‚Äôm not able to achieve anything and in order to reassure that I still could and that I still have many options in life, I made exact plans of when to study what and how to get my thinking and writing more structured, thus shaping me into being more of a thinker an judger, and maybe a sensor as well. Thus, in junior and senior years, I studied excruciatingly, sticking to my plans although it was extremely hard to do so, and was so focused on my goal of getting straight As, that I would have made myself suffer extreme consequences in case I didn‚Äôt endure the process until my final exams were over (probably still the only way to get me finish something in a proper manner). This was further complemented by an eating disorder, depression and the kind of social anxiety I mentioned earlier. \n\nI did succeed, in the end, but only because I took maths and physics as major subjects, being easy for me as they are very straightforward and it is easier to get good grades as the answers are not subjective, providing a kind of certainty. Maths was also the subject I had to study least for. I also plan on majoring in Physics (it does interest me, but I also still want to achieve something in science to feel ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù)\n\nAs I took a gap year after school, my ENFP side started to shine through more and more again, but I ask myself whether enjoying maths and science and being an ENFP actually contradicts itself or not.\n\nThe only reason I could imagine is that in science, you get an aha-moment every now and then, which feels like an achievement or like having put an end to something (which we as procastinators don‚Äôt do so often), and that in maths, tasks aren‚Äôt usually too long (at least not in school), so you have the satisfying feeling of having done something more than often.\n\nSo, is being ENFP and liking maths contradicting? Are there any fellows around who also enjoy maths and science?\n\n
3	Labels don‚Äôt define you.
1	Yes. Why would being an ENFP and enjoying math contradict? We enjoy most things and are often quite smart. The majority of geniuses are ENFP, or so a study said. We like  math and science and everything else and can be very good at them. I've always gone between math and science. In college I got A's in Biology and Biology II among other things and was asked to tutor. I was intending to be a genetic engineer but then switched to getting into acting more.\n\nThere are many scientist ENFP's and I have often seen posts here by computer programmers and the like. ENFP only means your top function is directed outward, finding patterns and connections and new ideas, then you run it through your value system of Fi, then you use Te to make ideas reality and be assertive and efficient, and finally you use Si to organize and catalog everything you learn and experience and if you develop it can get into routines. It is fairly broad.\n\nDon't let some definition you read somewhere limit you. You can have tons of friend or none (like me), be out doing everything or spend most of the time at  home (as I do). There is no one way to be ENFP. These types are just vague guides. Use them to grow and develop but no more. Don't box yourself in. After all we ENFP's hate boxes.
1	Of course ENFPs can love math! 
1	>I was tested as gifted in kindergarten, as I  was generally interested in numerous subjects and taught things like  reading to myself at age three out of interest. I assume that due to  this, I always felt special and kind if superior to others at an early  age, and my grades proved so.\n\nIf you are intellectually gifted, there's a high chance you find math enjoyable. Your attraction towards math doesn't have anything to do with your personality type.
1	I‚Äôm an English teacher and writer, but I love maths. Skills in maths are often related to skills in music (which I also have).
1	For me it depends on the kind of math. Statistics and Calculus were pretty easy for me in engineering school. On the other hand, discrete math and logical science, I absolutely sucked at. TFW you stop seeing numbers and normal operators and instead you have to use random shitty symbols to prove theorems. FeelsGood.
1	I could not stand math for math's sake. Now when it was applied to electricity, I found it to be fascinating.
59	When ENFP‚Äôs meet new people	
30	I always think it's funny the first few days on a new job (or similar situations). I always think, "I am not this person that you're meeting right now."
10	We IN_ _ types appreciate this.\n\n(üòä also don't stop üôÉ)
6	Depends whether im drunk or not
6	This is so me. The initial hesitation of opening up, confuses me sometimes. Because I begin to think, "I'm not this silent irl." 
3	Intimidating others is one of my biggest concerns when interacting in social situations.
3	I have to stop myself from blurting out my most hilarious stories all at once. I need to save them for the right moment for maximum laughs. 
1	I have held back ALL the time for years. I can find my own behavior and personality to be a bit too much... But, I always want to see what happens and that little voice says "Do it anyways. It will be fun." I think "Well that is some sound logic." and off I go, tasting things, wearing them, or seeing what they look like in a tree.
26	Are y‚Äôall ever awkward with some people or take a while to warm up until you can be your charming, full ENFP self?	
20	Yes. I feel that if I go full ENFP straight away, people will think I'm stupid / too intense / lack social skills. Which would lead to them not wanting to get to know me. But if I lay the base first by, I don't know, "playing by the rules", they will know I am capable of "normal" interaction and might react better to my ENFP-ness too.\n\nThis takes quite a lot of energy, so I'm kind of wanting to try a different approach next time I meet someone. But it's scary, so I'm not sure if I can actually do it.
7	Yes. It pretty much doesn't matter the context, the moment i walk into a room i am not going to be at 100%. It takes time to get on other people's levels, even if i know what im walking into. Sometimes its a quicker transition than others. \n\nSurprise run ins, even with friends, can be awkward because im not as "on" as theyre used to. Im generally in la la land when im alone, even if im in public. 
6	Yes. Big time.
6	All the time 
6	Yeah. Worst for us ENFP men too. 
5	Depends if I click with the person.   When I met my girlfriend ( together over a year now) I was straight full enfp, but when it comes to work or just out with my girlfriend, it takes me a bit to warm up.  Prime example, last night we were over her mother's house and she asked to do this dance thing I do when she blasts house music ( pelvic thrusts in the air, headbanging , some weird freaky moves) I had to give her a second look for approval to see if it was okay with do it in front of her.  Go along with it and both are dying from laughing so hard.   And when it comes to my randomized thought process, it's beyond me how everyone thinks I'm funny but it's just normal talking for me.  
5	Yes with my colleague and managers . I really have to be cautious so they won‚Äôt notice I‚Äôm an odd girl at the beginning. 
4	Often times I have to warm up! Then are they surprised :D 
4	100%  \nI was actually thinking just yesterday about how it took me a solid couple of months before I felt that I could fully open up and be myself around my coworkers at my residency. There's about 50 people total. And it wasn't like I was shy and not talking to all of them from day 1, because I was. But I felt like I had to feel out the room, so to speak, and get to know them better before I could unleash my full personality, lol. And, to discover the two people who don't vibe with my personality, that way I can change things up a bit when its just me and them working together.
2	Yes here
1	It depends on how invested I need to be in this person. I might give them 100% just to get them to bugger off.
29	Do you guys feel incredibly intelligent...just in all the wrong areas?	I would like to say I'm intelligent...I've spent so much time with my head buried in Wikipedia and reference books that I have to be...I retain so much of the information and I know a lot of things like how nuclear reactors work, diseases, germs, how most parts of a car work in a bit of detail, a lot of history and a lot of other stuff...\n\nBut I lack common sense. And I always seem so stupid to people. At one of my jobs, I was called a retard multiple times a day by my boss (it's construction, I'm an apprentice, if you don't have thick skin, you won't last long.) And I rightfully deserved it simply because I didn't fucking think half the time and could have been far more efficient. My boss always told me I was extremely intelligent but I was a retard because I didn't think before I acted
12	yeahh i just think you gotta find a job that uses your strengths. i also felt i lacked common sense but you catch on to stuff eventually
11	ENFPs are so fucking smart and no one ever recognizes it. It's honestly infuriating. People have always told me that I'm much smarter than the ones in my life and it really does piss me off.
6	I soo agree, I feel like I know lots of stuff that I just find interesting and exciting and understand people well, but people often see me as kind of naive or ditzy because I lack some common sense
3	I get this. I‚Äôm really book smart. But I‚Äôm also incredibly ditzy and lack common sense. The truth is, I enjoy being intelligent and it‚Äôs nice that things come easily to me as I love to learn. However, I‚Äôd probably be a lot better off with less book-smarts and more common sense. Unfortunately, common sense isn‚Äôt really something you can learn.\n\nIt also bothers me that people assume I‚Äôm dumb, but that‚Äôs a whole different story.
3	I'm the same way, but I tend to attribute it to my ADHD rather than being ENFP, but it might be both.\n\nADHD often effects motor skills and so it takes me a lot longer to get good at something physical at a job than usual. I'm a CNC Machinist and so I went through a period of time where I was yelled at consistently for being a dumbass because I would make careless mistakes and careful ones too.\n\nI consider myself quite intelligent (I hate saying it though, because I think it sounds like bragging or a huge ego) I know a ton of information about many fairly complex things from extensive personal research. If it's purely a cognitive task and abstract, I'm your guy. If it has to do with hyper-efficiency, organization, time management, physical activities, or mundane affairs, then I look like a complete idiot.\n\nFunny thing with ADHD is that I have an insanely good memory for things that are personally meaningful and engaging, but absolutely terrible memory for anything in boring old daily life, like appointments, bills, etc... What I was just doing a second ago? Why did I walk into this store? Oh hey, I forgot to buy 90% of my groceries from my imaginary list and came home with a new electronic device instead. Shit, where's (insert literally everything I have held in my hand for half a second before misplacing it)?\n\nAll that make me look like a dumbass to most people, and they often tell it to me. It's usually the kind of people who are black and white thinkers and think that they are the smartest person in the room because of how efficient and organized they are.
2	I‚Äôm still in construction !\nI would tell my boss, I will take longer than most to learn something, but if they bare with me, I‚Äôll be worth it. They were patient  and were glad. They also said I was half genius , half moron (pretty accurate)\nI know run my own business, but have guys working for me that pick up we‚Äôre I‚Äôm weak. But the things I do best, I do and we are doing pretty well. \nAs far as intelligence; it depends on who‚Äôs scale you‚Äôre being tested on. \nMy dad has a really, really high IQ, but, I am not him, and I don‚Äôt want to be.\nJust try to figure out what you are smart in and work with that.\nYou may not have enough experience to your boss, and he says your stupid, but that‚Äôs just some guys impression. \nBooks don‚Äôt make you smart, they give you knowledge. Remembering stuff you read, just means you can remember stuff. \n
1	Relatable hahaha. I am intelligent when it comes to mathematics and theory crafting solutions to problems. 99% of people who I chat with sleep on these conversations haha.\n\nI think this highly depend on the group of people you hang out with. If you find yourself a small group of friends that can hold conversations towards your interest, it isn't bad.\n\nI am actually getting myself ready for the day to hang out with two of them :) 
1	Used to be in the medical field and was told I was to smart to be where I was at and should of went RN instead of being CNA for years.  I feel like if I did that route I would of been in some big time trouble for derping out like I usually do.  Right now I'm doing pest control tech and still trying to figure out what I really would like to do.  I'm debating if I want to go into web development or coding but not sure.   I wish I could get looked at and see if I have a form of adult ADHD since one, I can never make up my mind or have any kind of focus plus I can never really finish small tasks.  But I can tell you all day about things I super enjoy.  
1	I think it‚Äôs about working experience. You are just an apprentice ofc you are not so experienced enough to take care of your every move. Don‚Äôt feel underestimated about your intelligence / knowledges , when your boss said that
1	>But I lack common sense. And I always seem  so stupid to people.

5	ENFP jealousy	Hi there.\nI need some help, don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs an ENFP thing or just human. But I thought it might be worth checking with you guys.\n\nSo I‚Äôm ‚Äúsuffering‚Äù from jealousy. I recently started dating a girl, we confirmed that we‚Äôre a couple and she‚Äôs moving in in a couple of weeks. So I should be pretty confident that she likes me?\n\nLast night she had ha male friend over to her apartment. (She told me so it wasn‚Äôt a surprise) Of course you can have a lot of friends from the opposite sex without having any intentions.\n\nI got really upset, I told her I was upset, she said I don‚Äôt have to worry, and I‚Äôm still upset.\n\nDo you have any tips? Tricks? Or anything that can help me get through this. I want to be able to trust her with all of her friends and don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs out on a ‚Äúc*ck sucking parade‚Äù every time.\n\nThanks!
13	You just have to trust someone. It is hard but if you love them you have to put yourself out there like that. It might blow up in your face but no risk, no reward.
5	Hey there fellow enfp here! And yes I exactly know how that feels because I've been there. Trust me my friend it took my a lot of arguing with my gf but it all turned out good. How? First of all, as an enfp I believe it's good to have effective communication between the both of you. We as enfp with no doubt require a lot of reassurance and when I say a lot I mean THAT much(those quarrels I had). But we also have to think that we want us to be happy in this relationship so I guess if you can ask her for reassurance that would be great, but not too much as we don't want to annoy your our partners. The key here is when you get reassured, immediately think of other key factors that supports the assurance you had(like moving in together). If she doesn't like you like you she wouldn't have assured and agreed in moving in together right? Then finally when you have made those connections, trust her with all your heart because you love her and want this relationship to last. That's all from me, hope this helps‚úåüèª

3	alright guys and gals, it's been wonderful but i have had my meal and i am going to sleep. i will likely answer your questions after the fact though, if you still want to submit them. 
3	If I match with INTJs on tinder, what should I expect? 
2	When you are sober are you the form of INTJ:\n\n* that is quiet, or\n\n* do you talk a lot for you have things that are important to share?
2	If im moving millions of molecule's while sitting in a chair doing nothing and my wife is cooking lunch at 11 in the night, how bright is the sun shining outside?
2	Do you open up to your friends over time or should I try to ask certain kind of questions?\n\nI feel like INTJs don't really do spontaneous over sharing like we ENFPs :D
2	If I were to say have one in mind that I wanted to capture and lock in a basement, what's the most efficient way of executing this plan?
2	Date? JESUS. I just want to talk. When sober I am generally quiet unless engaged. 
1	Lol wuht.... 
1	What can change the nature of a person that does not involve punishment?
2	I CAN'T STUDYYYY	hi a fellow enfp here who's finals in 2 days and can't seem to focus on his books or exercises anymore because of the electronics, soc med, comfort of watching YouTube, exploring personality types and etcüò≠ I really need help why does my brain feel and my body works like this. Oh note that I'm in stem branch and currently doing degree in Electrical power engineering. I enjoyed my classes(if the lecture is not slow and draggy) and most oftentimes enjoy any practical or hands on. But that's not the main case, because the main thing is - Finalsss\n\nAny form of help in terms of idea, opinions will be very much appreciated thanks :>
3	Fellow STEM ENFP here! I‚Äôve had similar issues and my advice to you is to set defined goals in your studies before moving on to other tasks. Using realistic planning and allocating your time and resources to the best of your ability, just begin to check stuff off of your list and you‚Äôll find that you‚Äôre in a groove. Btw I‚Äôm a Microbiology student and I‚Äôm extremely glad that I‚Äôm not having to take your engineering exams. Best of luck! Youve got this, friend. 
2	Hi5 and thanks for the question.. \nMy exams are approaching closely and I have the same issue
2	Adventure Time Sunday!	\n/r/ENFP! What shenanigans have you been up to this week? Any new adventures planned for the next?\n\nLet's here some stories!
1	I got so caught up in my best friends 21st birthday dinner that I ended up paying over $100 in drinks, but felt I couldn‚Äôt back out after I got the tab. That said, he and his friends had such a great time that I‚Äôd do it again in a heartbeat. 
1	First time ever I lifted a girl up in my arms yesterday. Felt like I could do anything now. Tried to lift her up again out of love but this time climbing the stairs, couldn't do it. Now feel like it is tough stuff to pull off. \n\n 
57	x/post from R/widower, Appreciation for INTJ Husband from ENFP Widow	I'm 28, and a little over three months out from when my 35-year-old husband died of cancer. Today was a particularly hard day, and I relate it partially to MBTI. I've always felt like the black sheep in my family. I'm an ENFP surrounded by sensors. They love small talk, safe, surface-level conversations, while I want to discuss deeper, more abstract topics, like the meaning of life and death (before I was widowed, but even more so now). Growing up, I often felt misunderstood by my family, and so did my INTJ husband by his family (they are all sensors as well).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI get ambushed by overwhelming grief from time to time, but as I mourn his loss, I also feel so deeply grateful that I got to love and be loved by this rare, wonderfully complex human being (if only for a little while longer). I realized that before we got married, I used to be afraid of marriage, the idea of being trapped in a relationship with someone unable to sustain my interest long-term. As we fell in love, I almost forgot about that fear entirely, because I realized my husband's mind could never cease to fascinate me. He used to constantly verbalize how lucky he felt to be with me, but I wish I told him more often that I feel blessed to have him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen he and I started dating, before we even knew each other's MBTI, we could feel our minds melding. For the first time in our lives, we experienced love and understanding from another human being, bound by an attraction that was all at once physical, emotional, spiritual, and intellectual. We were like two sides of the same coin, opposite but, at our cores, kindred spirits. I loved his natural inclination to get lost in his head, his quiet authenticity, and warm heart, hidden behind the seemingly emotionless visage of a stoic (He had read Marcus Aurelius and resonated with the philosophy of stoicism). His mind was a palace few had access to, until he decided to let me into a few rooms. As we deepened in love and trust, I got to explore more of the inner sanctums of his mind palace. Strolling through the intricate hallways, I would feel both privileged and sad that few (and in fact, no one else) had taken in the beauty of the architecture around me. I later came to learn that the people he had attempted to allow in, early in his life, had failed to comprehend the complexities that lay within, and that hurt him. That's when the palace became a fortress. I sometimes felt like an invader, trying to climb past the barriers interspersed throughout, but he loved that I was willing to climb the walls he didn't know were raised. I recall a moment when we were laughing together, and he was acting uncharacteristically silly, dancing even, as he cracked joke after joke. He seemed free. "I've finally unlocked your silly side," I said triumphantly. Then, he told me, in a very serious tone, "You're the only one who ever has." He was rarely sentimental, but he had a way, every now and then, of making statements in a matter-of-fact manner like that which left me feeling utterly disarmed. Defenseless. Those were the moments when I came to realize that he was also finding his way through my fortress, climbing over walls I didn't know were raised.
7	This is such a beautiful post, your writing is incredible. \n\nI am so sorry for your loss.\n\nI really relate to you in terms of being the black sheep in your family. I am an ENFP raised by a family of ESTJs and ISFJs. They really do love small talk and meaningless conversations, often plagued by criticizing everything and everyone they see, all the while missing important conversations that I wish we could share. \n\nOne of my best childhood friends (that I still keep in touch with) is an INTJ and the moment we started being friends was because I managed to make her laugh, and we had a crazy fit of laughter. We joke about how every time we have a reunion we always end up having a laughing fit together and it's one of my favorite feelings. We understand each other completely even though we are very different people.\n\nI wish you all the best and send you lots of hugs and love. <3 
4	This is beautiful. l really resonated with your story.. being around all sensors...  I can only dream of finding someone exactly as you described one day.\n\nI‚Äôm so sorry for your loss, but I hope you find comfort in knowing that you got to experience someone so precious and perfect for you, as you were to him. 
3	This is beautiful, and it makes me very sad that you've lost it. But on the other hand, you got to experience it and that's amazing.  I'm sorry for your loss.
3	I'm truly at a loss for words... your post resonated with me deeply.\n\nMy soulmate is an INTJ and he's told me that I'm the only one who's been able to bring out the carefree laughter and joy of his spirit that he's never felt comfortable enough to express with anyone else. He's my best friend, my home, my shelter away from a world of harsh misunderstandings and misrepresentations of who I am, and I can't imagine my life without him. What you two had... no, what you two *have* (because his memory is not lost) is, and will continue to be, an ethereal bond that cannot be forgotten. I'm on the verge of tears typing this because I can't begin to fathom how you feel in this moment, but thank you for sharing the sanctity and serenity of your relationship with this world. I hope the memories you hold of him will live on to bring you a lifetime of peace and comfort.\n\nThank you for your beautiful words... much love and support from your fellow ENFP. <3
2	This is beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è 
2	Wow. That brought me to tears. How beautiful to experience that level of connection and love with someone. To be met, challenged, and explored by another. To feel seen after childhoods of not feeling that way. 
2	What happened to you us one of my biggest fears and I somehow tend to convince myself it couldn't happen because of its excessive cruelty.\nReading your post makes me want to hug you so bad, I really hope the best for you. I can see through your words you're a sweet soul and you deserve the best! I really mean it.
1	Your life is picturesque and I do know you have more colors to add to it and I can tell that much with certainty form your post and your username. Have a good life, young one.
0	You'll find someone else. <3
6	Davesuperpowers Interview About ENFP Success By Kendrick Uy	
275	Too accurate	
22	I started considering eating breakfast a major win. If I didn't get anything else on my list done, at least I ate breaky. 
9	My productivity shuts down after lunch.
7	So accurate lol
5	Personal attack
4	Yep lol I dislike this about myself sometimes
4	Actually I'm good at doing many projects in one day. But I have to not have any responsibilities that Day (no college, no work, not having to meet with people XD). Give me one of these and I'll just listen to music whole day.
3	Loooooooord why is this so true?! üòÇ Glad I‚Äôm not the only one though...
3	WOW, this is so accurate. It's crazy how accurate ENFP is! 
3	Damn, this is true. Does this make me an ENFP, or is it true for other types as well?
3	I feel personally attacked
2	Relatable 
2	High Income Skill	I'm looking for high income skill ideas. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to take my financial future seriously. I come from a broke, drug and gambling addicted family tree. My parents have broken us out of that environment but the "poor people habits" are still kicking around. I'm comfortable being and staying broke AF and want to change that. \n\nI'm a 21M marketing student btw. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome perusing on YouTube brought me Dan Lok - he teaches sales. I'm interested in his perspective on investing. He breaks it down in 3 steps lol.\n\n1. High income skill: something you can make $10 000 / month doing. Not a job, but something your good at that you can continue getting better at and give more value.\n2. Scalable business: start a business that is easy to grow. Businesses that sell ideas scale well because there is no cost to expanding. Just hiring/training more staff. \n3. Invest in stocks/bonds/real estate. He argues that investing before you have strong earning power is a waste of time. Investing in yourself is a better payoff. With your base built you can start to building real wealth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways. I'm trying to find a skill or set of skills that I can work at to make money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have ideas of my own, but I want to pick your brain.

62	Literally!!	
-1	So then choose the best option out of those 8. Pretty simple lel
48	Having to tell my ‚Äúplans‚Äù to people erodes my soul.	Examples: \n\nWhen are you waking up tomorrow? \nWhere do you want to live after graduation?\nWhat‚Äôs you plan for the day? Sweating just thinking about it... 
21	Planning out stuff like that makes me feel trapped. Quit trying to box me in, dang!
17	YES. And then if they give me ADVICE? It‚Äôs like they have killed me off completely. We may never speak again. 
12	My friend suggested I plan myself a life goal and list out achievable goals for the next 5 - 10 years to get there. Nice advice but BRUH I don‚Äôt even know where I‚Äôll be next month let alone in 10 years time! I‚Äôve lived a lot more experiences and life than him so far by living with my spontaneity so I‚Äôm not bad about it :)
5	I hate it when they keep persisting with their ideas, even though it's the furthest thing from what you want to do/buy/like etc. Sometimes I just want the option that will give me the most options.
4	YES this is me exactly. It's why I prefer to live alone than with others: ultimate freedom, and no justification of what I'm doing. \n\nI'm currently at home staying with family for a couple of months, and it's really frustrating when they ask, "what are you going to do?" \n\nI'm like, "idk work, maybe hangout with friends, maybe go to a party, maybe do yoga, maybe hike, maybe eat food, maybe ride a scooter around, can I just be???????" \n\n
3	Haha this is so me. And when I do make plans I instantly regret it because I feel like my freedom to choose has been taken away.
2	Unfortunately, where I live, PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE is very important. I've had these pep talks since forever. 
2	Ugh. So like I am a general planner, like I wanna know what day I‚Äôm generally doing something and stuff but I don‚Äôt need to give details. For example- general- on this day I‚Äôm going to go skiing. Friend- okay we‚Äôre skiing ... what time do we want to do the big slope... Me- idc I‚Äôm gonna do it when I feel like it. Friend- how about 1:30pm. Me- ........ *panicking inside bc I feel like I have to commit but also don‚Äôt want to commit bc I don‚Äôt want to but also want to commit bc I don‚Äôt want to disappoint*
1	I'm currently having massive arguments with my family just because I refuse to keep telling people my plans 
1	Happens with us too but only when told to the wrong person..feels as if something is lost \[its small though\]
1	Me: I wanna do something today\n\nMy Parents: ok....what were  you thinking\n\nMe: ????
1	Too scared to talk with people/friends, anyone been through something similar and gotten out of it?	My mind just closes off and shuts out others. Wanting to take the steps to get out of this mindset but not really sure where to start.
5	I feel the same way tbh.. whenever I try to say something that interests me to my family or friends i immediately feel as if i‚Äôm being judged or misunderstood. But i always try to remind myself that what I feel may be wrong and push past that fear of being vulnerable and open with others bc you never know what may happen :)\n
3	I have struggled with this as well. It has taken me a very long time to find people who make me feel as though they actually ‚Äúsee‚Äù me and I can trust them enough to open up. So I am not sure if I have really ‚Äúgotten out of it,‚Äù or just found people who are worthy. I say keep looking. And take small risks when you can. 
1	I‚Äôm the same way. Since most people I feel like get me are similar to me, they don‚Äôt stay around long and I have a lot of long distance relationships. I don‚Äôt open up a lot, though people think I do bc I‚Äôm friendly and the information I share is enough for them to feel like they know me but nothing I feel is super pertinent to who I am as a person. Recently opened up with a friend about something‚Äôs that are dear to me and that trust was betrayed. Now I feel like I can‚Äôt trust anyone and I‚Äôm afraid to be vulnerable again bc I don‚Äôt feel like I can trust this friend or anyone. \n\n*dont stay around long because we‚Äôre always jumping from idea to idea or adventure to adventure
1	I like my boss But he is married	My boss Is one of the most charming people I‚Äôve  ever met i like him .. i never told him and I  act with him as if he is the least important person ..\ni hate the fact that I like him ..it hurt so bad and i know I know I‚Äôll never tell him I wish him happiness with his family and I wish that my feelings will go away 
4	You prob like him so much because you can‚Äôt have him so it‚Äôs ‚Äúsafe‚Äù. I‚Äôm sure he has annoying qualities just like everyone else. Sometimes we ENFPs can romanticize people or put them on a pedestal. Just some things to think about to help rationalize it!
1	Yep, focus on his bad points and look elsewhere!
1	Don't do it! Go meet other people. The world is so large, full, and walkable. Now go run those feelings out of you!
133	I needed to hear it. Maybe you do too.	
6	I really did actually. A close friend of mine has just passed. 
2	Really needed! Thank you so much my mate! Have a great weekend :)
2	Thank you... <3
2	##I CALL BULLSHIT
2	It‚Äôs not that, I just don‚Äôt want there to be a tomorrow with me in it 
6	Can't seem to shake the dark space I'm in	Hi all!! It's been a while since I've been on here 8)\n\nOver the past few months, I've graduated, landed an impressive job for my field, and... feel like I've been creeping back into the habits that limit my happiness. Even though the job I got offers incredible opportunity, it is only a temporary position. It is also purely administrative (minus the 3 hours I spent proofreading documents every day), high volume, fast-paced, and, to me, feels robotic by nature. The people I work with are great, and this is the field that I want, but I am not happy. I moved away from my friends, I'm lonely, and I have 1-2 anxiety attacks per week (I haven't gotten them in quite some time now). I don't know what to do. I feel so overwhelmed by everything; namely that I just feel so lonely.\n\nAnd no matter what I do, it feels like I can't get away from the 8-year long struggle that has been me barely making rent/bills/tuition. I had this naive vision that once I get a job that wasn't serving, it would be better. I was so excited to move here for a fresh start in the workplace that I've dreamed. But my role is lackluster and dull. I have no deep social connection. I have no money, therefore ability, to participate in the things that I know increase my happiness (high-intensity fitness classes or just fitness classes in general, and horseback riding). I feel disenchanted and slinking into depression.\n\nMy brain won't stop thinking, and I feel constantly overstimulated. I'll try to be mindful or go on walks, but it only helps in the moment. I have spent a while studying stoicism, but it feels like all of that has just slipped away... I just want to be around my close friends, laughter, and positivity. And to top it off, I've been talking to my ex again. It feels selfish and stupid, but they're pretty much one of the only people in my life right now who has really tried to be in it.\n\nSo... I suppose I have a few questions. First off, I am wondering if any of you share this intense anxiety I feel. Secondly, I am in near opposition of anti-anxiety meds, but I can't feel that they will genuinely help me right now. And last, I had such **strong** coping mechanisms for things like this. I don't know why they've gone out the window, and how to get them back. Do any of you have any advice or consolation?\n\nI appreciate it dearly.
2	Yes! Im just about to graduate and I havnt gotten any job offers and Ill get ino these funks where I feel ill never be able to get a job. And Ill panic and feel anxious but then family will comfort me. Tonight I had to go take a test until 10 Pm with bronchitis and Im getting back into gloom mode. The weather doesnt help! 
1	I definitely relate to you, and I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre sinking into that space. Try to take it day by day and slowly get more involved in things you enjoy doing. Go to a physician for a checkup and see what they say, meds may definitely be worth it to try out and see. Also attempt various coping skills, activities, and try not to isolate yourself. Eventually if you really don‚Äôt like the job, consider something else. Also connect with family/ friends- even chatting on the phone. Best of luck and I hope you get back to your full self soon :)
1	Don't stress about your ex being support for you right now.  I have recently become chronically ill and my ex (we were close friends before and again after we dated) has been infinitely more supportive than my husband (unfortunately :( ) so I cry on his shoulder way more.  If you have severe anxiety, support is invaluable to help you climb back out of that hole, so accept it when it is offered. 
1	Hi friend!\n\nI‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through this. It sounds like you‚Äôre really missing your old community and connections. That‚Äôs so valid and normal and I would be freaking out too. \n\nI also just graduated, moved across the country & also have been having panic attacks almost every morning and feeling so guilty for being in my head and lacking in my performance at my new jobs, etc. also going from living with my best friends to living in a very domestic household. \n\nTo cope, I kinda studied philosophy too but went into a crazy existential ocd spell instead of realizing how much my environment affects my stability. \n\nYou went through a lot of change. Stoicism or not, you‚Äôre human, you have emotions, you crave familiarity and closeness, and you‚Äôre an ENFP, so superficial relationships won‚Äôt cut it. \n\nI am still struggling through this but I‚Äôve started just running, drawing, trying to talk to old friends, etc. but I feel you. My sense of humor is gone, I can barely talk, I wake up panicking, etc. \n\nSelf compassion & self love will help you through this. You are only human and this too shall pass. Love. 
5	I hate Tinder and the culture it creates and I have no better luck anywhere else, either. üòî	I'm not ugly...I've been told I'm attractive by many people (no, not my mommy and daddy...they always told me I was ugly) and I know I'm not exceptionally unattractive...and yet, I have no luck.  \n\nI try to make my bio as interesting as possible, not too long, just showing that I'm an ENFP, that I like deep conversations and that I don't hook up. I put a selfie of me as the first pic that people see, then a pic of me holding my niece, then a pic of me with a furry friend of mine, and then some of my photography. I've showed my profile to my girl friends, and they all said it looked good.\n\nAnd yet, I get no matches...it's just discouraging...half the time I get a match, I don't even get a message back. I always think up a message and never say "Just hi".\n\nThe one thing that bugs me the most about tinder is all of the people who put ways to give them money in their bio (Venmo, Cash App)...it just...disgusts me. Like...just the whole concept of that just disgusts me. Anyone else feel like that?\n\nI only swipe right on people who seem to have some substance to them, and I pretty much always swipe left on the most attractive people because I know that even if I match with them, it's more than likely they won't answer anyway.  There's just some cool people there among the bad and I just want to talk to them and I just never can. üòî\n\nUgh...the whole thing is just depressing. Anyone else feel like this too.
6	Hey! I've been using tinder myself (xNFP). I'm finding a lot of people who are into relationships actually! I'm a 29 year old female. Here's the thing:\nIf you look at someone's profile and you think you'd like to talk to them, for whatever reason, swipe right. I've gone into tinder specifically to try to get a better feel for who I actually want to be with, to enjoy some sexual or romantic experiences, and to meet some great people. All of those things have happened. It might help you to get a really clear sense of what you want out of the experience. As long as you're respectful and kind you're not contributing to anyone else's negative experience on the app, you know? I could see NFP's worrying about that. Try not to worry if every swipe will be a lasting decision. It won't. You'll have to lighten up your expectations if you want to enjoy it! \n\nFor about 50 matches or so I've unmatched 10, either for lack of interest or they said something rude, talked to a few and it never went anywhere (sometimes because of me, sometimes they kinda faded), with some neither of us ever messaged first and they're still on my matches lol. \nI've gone out with 5-10 people maybe and had 3 situations that turned into more than 1 date. \n\nPM me if you have any questions. I don't know if this was helpful, just hoping that sharing my experience might help a bit? I also know that the tinder experience for men and women is very different. Idk how old you are but r/datingoverthirty has some good advice about online dating. \n\nEDIT: keep reworking your profile. I swipe left if they have anything negative (i.e. 'no such and such' or 'why do you women all have Snapchat filters'), anything self-deprecating that makes them seem insecure, if they obviously want a wife (I'm not there to get wifed). I swipe right if they're cute, seem smart, funny, or kind. Oh and I say what kind of people I like in my profile (kind, genuine, good communicators). Seems to help people self-select for me. 
3	[deleted]
2	Dont let it bring you down, Id say im an average looking dude and when i was on tinder, there were days that I would get 2-3 matches and then I would go on a week without a match.\n\nTinder is supposed to be fun, dating is supposed to be fun so use jokes. Show people your funny side and show people that you are interested in them. Be confident. if they don‚Äôt message you back, so what? Move on.\n\nIt has a lot to do with the law of average as well, the more you swipe right, the better chance of you getting a match. Be selective but dont overthink it\n\nI‚Äôve been dating this one girl I met on Tinder for like 2 weeks, 3 dates, and we really hit it off. We‚Äôre both ENFP. 
2	Here's my advice:\n\n1. Don't take your results so personally. I know that it sucks--it's hard not to think there's something wrong with YOU, but those are just thoughts and not reality. \n2. Use your results (or lack of results) as an experiment. Keep changing things until something sticks.\n3. I would suggest getting a guy friend to look at your profile (if you're looking for men) so you can get some constructive feedback on your pictures.\n4. Stop swiping left on attractive people. Swipe right on whoever you find attractive (for whatever reason).\n5. Your profile sounds too serious to me. Give people an impression of what having a conversation with you is like, not stats (no mbti type or "what you're looking for")\n6. Don't give up if it's important to you. :) 
2	I really like the dating app called ‚ÄúCoffee Meets Bagel‚Äù. I met my now-husband on there! I tried many dating apps back in my dating days and CMB had the best quality matches. They use a preferences tool to match you with certain people, and they try to match you with friends of friends that you already have on Facebook. Basically their philosophy is that you know somebody who knows someone who is single. You just haven‚Äôt crossed yet. They do this through Facebook. Makes it less creepy too! However, one caveat is that people only really have this app in big cities. Best of luck!! 
1	Tinder is not really the place for relationships. It seems more about just hooking up (which is why you probably don't get many matches or messages since you list no hookups in bio). No one reads profiles much though. If you really want to find someone try sites like OKCupid. It's free and good. I found my first girlfriend there. They have an app but I use the site.\n\nThe part I'm confused about is that you don't swipe right on "attractive" people. Why not? It's easy and if they don't match you no harm, no foul. But if they do why assume they won't message? Why do you assume attractive people are shallow? I think you are judging by appearance a lot yourself.
1	Tinder is filled with thirsty sensors. Like another person said on here, hooking up is what 99% of them want. It's like you entering a butcher's store to ask for a salad. Find your right market share, a small share within the right niche will yield better results. Otherwise do an experiment, swipe right on 1000 profiles, and see what kinds of responces and what kinds of people you get for the giggles.
1	People are morons.  Culture is vapid.  I feel like this when I am on Twitter too.  Tinder and Twitter are full of the lowest lifeforms on the internet.
11	Is anyone else only attracted to INxx?	Hi, ENFP female here, and I've discovered that my relationships have ONLY ever been with INxx dudes. Does anyone else notice this? My best friend is an ISFJ and he is low-key in love with me but I just couldn't ever connect with him on the level where romance takes place for me -- even though he's thoughtful and kind and everything I should want in a person.\n\nNote: I didn't type the guys I was interested in outright and then decide to be into them. It's just always ended up that way. \n\nAlso I just think this is pretty cruel tbh since INFJs and INTJs in particular are so rare lol
10	Speaking from the other side, I've definitely observed this. ENFPs do not often find themselves in my circle of quiet nerd friends, but when I do meet them, they become deeply invested in me VERY quickly. Faster than anyone else. It's kind of terrifying.
6	=(
5	INFJs are amazingly easy for me to connect with.
4	INTJs all day\n\n&#x200B;
3	I feel it, the best girlfriend I had was INTP
3	Yes I am exactly the same way!!! ENFP male here. INxx have always been my ex-girlfriends. \n\nI feel like introverts can handle more depth, listen better, etc. and ENFP's are the "most introverted extroverts" because of all our ideas & little worlds we live in, so that's the theory for why we match with introverts (and the intuitive types, as we are also the intuitive types). \n\nI can't tell whether my exes were F's or T's. I've never had any of them take the test. I'm not in contact with my first exes, and I'm still mourning my last ex, but I'm kind of curious of having a friend of a friend make her take the test to see what she was... my guess is INxJ. \n\nI believe that all of my exes are J types as well. I've always been like "woohoo freedom internet business I don't know where I'll be in 5 years probably successful but I won't commit to anything too much because I want to be free" and then my exes were like, "yeah I'm gonna do XYZ, then ABC, then 123, and in 10 years I'll be here." \n\nBeing a Perceiver, I guess it worked out even better because I could fit my life of freedom & openness within that structure... \n\nBut yeah always INxx are what I'm attracted to. Don't know why. Just is. 
2	ENFP female here who's been besotted only three times in her life. All three men are....\*drum roll\* INTJs. All three of them and the first two were before I discovered MBTI and my INTJ man who I'm almost embarrassingly taken with was just like me: we'd done the test, discovered our types, took a peek into our strengths and weaknesses and that was about it. We only recently realised we all have our 'natural partners'  (Ours being INTJ and INFJ) and it's all making sense to me now.   \nIt was like an instant bewildering connection that neither of us could explain. We acknowledged how interesting it was that we were so incredibly fascinated with each other from the first meeting even though on paper we'd be an odd pairing.  \nENFP seeks out INxJ partners because we fall in love with their minds and we love being pleasantly surprised in these moments where they reveal a softness and warmth to them that is strictly only accessible to their absolute and very few closest confidantes. Those breakthrough moments when a very rare side of INxJ is available to you is one of the most rewarding things we connection seeking ENFPs can experience out of a romantic relationship. \n\nQuote from my inebriated INTJ: "This might be Saturday night talking but I miss you. We talk every day! I never do long distance chat, barely even chat. Must like you." \n\nNuff said hahaha  \n
2	I think there is something about the opposites that attract us.   Challenge and balance.\n\nThe most connection and chemistry I ever felt was with an INTP (Female) .  (I am an ENFP Male).\n\nIt was a bit hectic and we struggled at times to communicate.  But damn it was incredible.
2	Yea almost all of them are NT people. It‚Äôs crazy. 
2	I‚Äôm INTP. My ENFP gf loves me to bits. But I have decent EQ and mentally healthy. We‚Äôre aliens and I like that. 
1	And those relationships haven't worked out for you. Maybe try a different type.
1	Do people on mbti subs send the test to all their friends or something? I don't really think mbti types matter all that much in romantic compatibility, socionics or enneagram would seem a better pick. Still though, this best friend situation just screams that he lacks strong masculine energy/behaviour/general attractiveness, nothing to do with some N or S. 
1	I feel like most types have a specific group that they love above most like for example I‚Äôm an INFJ and I love xNxPs way too much 
1	As ENFP : yeeees definitely !!\n\nINFJS and INTJs are indeed rare but huntable (haha) you just have to channel your vibes exactly in order to notice them, to be seen as you are by them (you are honey for them).\n\nYou have to be courageous and do the first step then, because they count on us..!
1	I‚Äôm probably gonna get shot for this, but... Does anybody else think it‚Äôs a little nonsensical to to pick partners based on a personality test?
12	Making an official ENFP discord?	I realize I could've just gone straight to the mods but I wanted to see if anyone else was interested in something like this. IRC is sorta dated and Discord is a real easy way to connect with people and get more relatively real-time conversations. I personally would love to have tons of people who think the same way as me accessible for advice and discussions and general casual conversation I suppose. \n\nSo yeah, would anybody else be keen on a discord being made official for the subreddit/ would mods be willing to manage it?\n\n
1	Hey! i think its a great idea, I would def join! 
1	Yeah, get the mods in so they can list in the description, etc.
1	I'll join. ‚ô•Ô∏è
1	I'll be there!!
1	I'd join
1	I'll join!!
1	i'd join it :0
1	Sure tbh
1	I‚Äôll join as well!!!!!!!! 
1	Definitely! Nice talking to other people who are similar!
1	How do I join!
1	Sure, sounds great!
6	ENFP Struggling to get over a break up... Send help please? (:	It's been a few months now and wow every day can still be such a struggle. \n\nOnly recently have I had days where I kind of feel like "myself." \n\nI'm also starting to get what I feel is "my edge" back. Like I'm actually enjoying life, socializing, and seeing the endless possibility of doing things. \n\nI'm also feeling inspired to fix up my life. My ex definitely dragged me down a bit ;( \n\nFor example, now I'm suddenly feeling more inspired to work on my business. It's like the realization that I can make more $ and live better is finally kicking in. I was so depressed my business came SO CLOSE to collapsing, but a client was desperate to get me re-approved by the board because he really cared for me so I got that client back... thank God. \n\nToday I finally also approached a girl that was pretty. She had a boyfriend, but man was it exhilarating... it felt like I was finally doing something FOR MYSELF FOR ONCE. \n\nI should also add that I took a large dose of magic mushrooms after the break up, which was NOT a good idea, because my ego died and it made me feel even lonelier.. or maybe that's just the break up. I've felt this way for a long time. Like doing things alone or for myself is so hard because there's no one to share it with, you feel? \n\nSo yeah if there's any ENFP-specific advice on break-ups or "putting your life back together," I'd greatly appreciate it (: \n\nOr digital hugs. Digital hugs work too. 
4	First of all, here's some digital hugs. ‚ù§Ô∏è \n\nSecondly, I haven't gone through any \*rough\* breakups (stayed in bad relationships way too long so when the time came it was easy to leave), so everything I'm about to say comes from the experience of getting over difficult personal situations in general. In fact, I'm currently surfacing from a 2-4 year long situation full of anxiety, stress and periods of slight depression and I'm finally starting to feel like myself again. \n\nYou will need to find a working balance between trying new things and withdrawing to process your thoughts and feelings. At first, like you said, you won't be able to feel true joy or excitement over things, and you might need way more withdrawal time than experimenting time. At some point you might also find out that an action you took to move forward in your life didn't take you where you wanted to be, and you might need to withdraw again to figure out what kind of turn to take next. But little by little you will find out things that work. Things you enjoy. Things that make you feel connected to the world around you again. \n\nRecovering will be a lot easier if you have people who support you. People who love you and appreciate you, people who are willing to let you bounce and reflect your thoughts with them. People who remind you that you're still valuable, lovable and capable, yet who won't be afraid to question your bad ideas. But most importantly: always strive to be who you really are. You might lose sight of yourself during hard times, that's a natural thing to happen when the fundamentals of your daily life suddenly change. Also sometimes you might mistake someone else's way to happiness for a universal one. But the way forward can be found within you. Your core values will carry you. \n\nUnfortunately I don't have any better advice than this. But I know you will get through your situation. I've come to understand that ENFP's are one of the most resilient people there are. 
2	I have no advice, but I feel you and just hang in there üíñüíñüíñüíñ Breakups are rough, man
2	Virtual hugs for you! I'm sorry about the breakup, they can be rough but it sounds like you're starting to find grounding for yourself.\n\nWhenever I go through a hard breakup just doing small things one day at a time helps. It helps me a lot to keep busy but also at a steady pace. Don't take too much in all at once or you'll crash and burn.\nSmall little accomplishments go a long way in making you feel better and healing you. Hope you feel better soon enough! Always remember, not all is meant to last and if it didn't work out there will be something else around that would be more of your match. :) 
2	This is weird bc I literally did the exact same thing. I had weird relationship end with a dude and was ~depressed~ for a little while. I talked to a few dudes and it boosted me up a ton but now I feel like I‚Äôm kind of coming down a little. However I did take some magic mushrooms too for the first time a few weeks ago. Felt great after and a lot of my anxiety seemed to fall beneath the surface. I think the loneliness comes and goes, somedays the harsh words hurt worse than others but I think it‚Äôs important to remember the only person who dictates your worth and value and mood at the end of the day is yourself and if someone else couldn‚Äôt see that in you it‚Äôs totally their loss. They‚Äôll probably realize it eventually but that doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt have to feel the hurt sometimes too. If it wasn‚Äôt for this we would never get to appreciate the Highs. They‚Äôll all play out in the meantime. Just a few shitty nights along the way. Hope you feel better soon because you deserve the world and everything good in it ü§ôüèª
3	Anyone listen to TheLazylazyme YouTube channel? It‚Äôs a goldmine of Ne-Fi tunes in my opinion. This track is stuck in my head at the moment.	
2	Omg this has a very similar sound to another artist I love Tash Sultana! Thanks for the great find!
8	Q: What do you do when you (ENFP) are alone?	I am trying to get a feel for the ENFP type and what ENFP types tend to do when they are alone. Like when you are at home and there is no one there and maybe you have 5 hours to spend alone, what do you tend to do? Be as descriptive as possible.
13	We need a lot of alone time. We are the most introverted extroverts after all. We need more alone time than not I think. We use it to process all the information we took in when we were out there using our Ne. We process it through our Fi to see how we feel about it, if we value it, etc. We also like to learn a lot of new things when alone, getting lost in Wikipedia holes, or TV Tropes, or other things. Then we use Si to catalog everything we learned and went though and organize it in our heads for future connection Ne making.
7	Get into my hobbies or go out alone :)\n\nNetflix, play games on my phone, read, browse Reddit, go to a museum, see a movie, nap, exercise, go for a walk, watch Good Mythical Morning
4	It's not descriptive at all but I honestly just play games and browse reddit. Sometimes when I throw on some karaoke and sing to myself because I'd like to improve. Otherwise I do homework, I'm trying to minimalize the time I spend at home though because I don't 100% like it.
6	I'm a bit on the introvert side (not INFP thou) and i actually like being alone for a time.\n\nI play PC, watch series or (try to) make music. Also reading a good book is always great or just listen to music.
5	I get depressed as hell. Honestly, I can't spend more than a couple hours without social, face-to-face contact. I can play games, read a book, or be on reddit or yt for a short while, but finally talking to someone is a major relief. If I don't, I feel so incredibly down, get awful thoughts in my head and I won't be able to do anything productive until I talk to someone again.
4	Introspection, youtube, video games, movies, studying, learning languages and trivia, texting, working out, taking care of my dogs, cooking, reading self-development and personal growth stuff.
5	Browse Pinterest for inspiration, watch Netflix, paint my nails, clean, drink coffee, come up with amazing ideas and investigate all the possible ways to accomplish them, meditate, pray, watch videos on YouTube, write in journal, read interesting books, harass my friends on Snapchat, make green smoothies, decorate planner, go for a walk or run, walk to coffee shops, create new playlists, stretch...
3	Most of my alone time is spent reading. I'm a mega bookworm.\n\nI also write, sew new clothes, draw costume designs I don't have a budget for (lol), watch Netflix and browse Reddit/Pinterest, or go on a walk and play Ingress. If I have some cleaning to do at home I'll get that out of the way so I don't go crazy and feel bad doing what I want to be doing.
2	It depends actually. We're the most introverted extroverts as someone else had commented before so there will be times that we need complete solitude to recharge ourselves.\n\nIt could go both ways for me. If I end up stuck at home and not because I choose to then I would up depressed and feel stuck.\nOther times it is because I feel overworked and I need to just reset myself a little. A little bit of self care. I would give myself a spa day, clean the house, run some errands, read or binge watch something on Netflix.\nUsually a day or two for myself to recharge is just perfect for me to get going again with my other commitments. 
1	I‚Äôm really into music, singing specifically so I do a lot of that, and since I‚Äôve had a vocal teacher it makes me not lose drive for it(like a lot of us do with every hobby). It also allows me to connect with my emotional side because I empathize really strongly with what a singer talks of(recently it‚Äôs been John Mayer haha).\nWhen I‚Äôm not doing that I‚Äôm learning music theory or anything to not be in my head because like a lot of us I can get in a bad head space very quickly. Yet I have learned how to deal with it and use my sad energy to enhance my songwriting. It‚Äôs all about finding away to express ourselves, for me that‚Äôs music and conversation.
1	I live alone and don't have much of a social life unfortunately, but I love to read. I read a crapton of fantasy, but I also do some research into various psychological/philosophical things. Carl Jung is probably my favorite in that aspect.\n\nI sometimes just lay down and binge listen to new music. I love to write and I'm trying my hand at writing a fantasy novel.\n\nI do get sucked into video games/anime more than I'd like to admit.\n\nWhen it's warm out, I like to go camping by myself or go on hikes in one of the bazillion state forests in Wisconsin. 
1	Anything I feel the whim to do that interests me. Gaming, listen to music, play piano, knit, craft, cleaning/yard-work, organize, shop, enjoy a spa day, watch a feel-good movie, write, draw, nap, take a drive, short hike or a long walk, read. \n\nThe best thing i‚Äôve done for me was to learn to love hanging out with myself! You‚Äôre the coolest cat you know! Only you can treat you with the respect you deserve! \n\nUnless you don‚Äôt feel this way. Then, you‚Äôve just got to hang out with yourself to find out all the things you are capable of! 
1	When I'm alone I love to waste my time playing ps4 games, listening to music, looking at Instagram or reading articles online. \nAs a busy working Mother, I often feel guilty for not using my time more efficiently, so I rebel as often as I can and I think that is why I am a happy person. \nI'm not a high achieving superwoman, I'm relaxed and content with life.
1	Get drunk and watch Hulu/ Netflix because I'm a sad shell of a human being.
1	Put some music on, look up the lyrics, relate it to my life. Look for recipes, cook, bake. Read fanfiction, fiction, Reddit, Quora, Wikipedia, philosophy books. Netflix, manga, anime. Stare into space, smoke a cigarette, take long showers. Write in my journal, cry about shit that happened ages ago which only just hit me now. Text my loved ones. Maybe do some chores...
38	Does it drive you insane when someone doesn‚Äôt like you?	When someone doesn‚Äôt like me, I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how I can make them like me. It makes me feel so sad, I want to make it up somehow...anyone else can relate? 
27	Yeah ENFPs hated when were not liked. This took me a long time to accept. Like only in the last year or two did i finally let that shit go that not everyone will like me. It's impossible to be universally liked. Shoot, even the Buddha wasn't universally loved and accepted. When it does bother me tho, I start remembering all my friends and the people that I do get along with. Then I'm like, "oh yeah, I'm not hated. Just this person doesn't like me. And that's ok". 
6	It used to bother me, but not anymore.  The advantage of age, insight and wisdom, I guess.
9	When I was younger I was concerned about this kind of thing. Now I'm just like, " Eh, Your loss." 
5	You will drive yourself crazy and depressed if you don‚Äôt let the desire for everyone to like you go. Liking yourself is SO much more important. And frankly, when you become a solid person from liking yourself, you will find that more people like you.\n\nSomething that was liberating for me was also letting myself dislike people. I realized I was so focused on myself and making people like me, I barely thought about whether or not I even liked them. \n\nA lot of times when I felt someone didn‚Äôt like me, I‚Äôd realize I also didn‚Äôt like them. They were often people who were really stuck up. So suddenly I stopped caring whether they liked me or not. 
3	Yeah it bums me out, you know why people sometimes dislike me though? Let me pit you a scenario\n\nLet's say I go to a party, I want to talk to everyone right? as ENFPs do. Now lets say guy likes girl, if I talk to that girl, that guy instantly has a disdain for me, this has happened so many times I'm kind of sick of it. They get threatened at the smallest interactions that the girl they like has with other guys. It's why I tend to just talk to the guys at parties now, rather than both genders. Female ENFPs can get away with talking to everyone, I think, because girls tend to not be so territorial.
3	Accepting that it doesn't matter if someone likes me or not was life changing. In my teens / early 20s I was far more concerned about this and it lead to bad social anxiety. I was constantly worrying what people thought, overthinking interactions, beating myself up over things I said or did that I thought came across awkward, and imagined people judging me. It was exhausting. And ironically by caring too much what people thought I came across more annoying or socially awkward because I wasn't being myself fully. \n\nNow my mantra is: "it is impossible for everyone to like me. And if they don't like me then it is their loss cause I'm awesome. I know I'm a friendly, kind, person who is trying my best. If they judge me or don't like me then they are not someone whose approval or friendship I need." And if I start to overthink something in the past I repeat "don't dwell" to myself and force myself to think of something else instead. \n\nIt is still a work in progress by I am so much happier and more confident. 
2	Yeah totally, recently finding out that a lot of people are only friends with me when we're out. I work at a club taking photos so I know about half the club and I thought that at least some of them were my friends. Found out last night they were only talking to me yesterday because I was towards the start of a queue (we queue for hot dogs/ burgers after the club is shut) and they didn't wanna go to the back of the queue. When I told hem where the back of the queue was (nicely) they just left. CBA to wait any longer. Once I got my food I saw them but they didn't bother to say hi and ask me to join them. A lot of people just really don't care \n\nIt's sad cause I like having loads of people to talk to which is why working at the club is perfect for me, but all the poeple I thought cared about me just don't. 
1	Yeah, this used to bother me too.  It still does a bit if I'm being perfectly honest.  However I've accepted that there will be people who won't like me.  And I will do things that some people don't like.  \n\nA wise person one told me "People who are like you, DasBeav, are mirrors.  When people don't like you, what they really don't like are themselves".  I think that applies to all of us ENFPs, and there's a lot of truth to it.
1	Honestly, not really. Maybe when I was younger? These days I have very few fucks to give and so I reserve them for whatever is important in my life. Most of the time if someone really doesn‚Äôt like me, they either a) don‚Äôt know me, or 2) they were an idiot and I had to call them out on it and they didn‚Äôt like it. BOOM. See ya buddy. I got some real shit to care about üòá
1	Yes I go through this, getting better though and understanding you‚Äôre not always going to be everyone‚Äôs cup of tea. 
1	Just depends. I'm a teacher, and when I have a student who says my name with bitterness, I can usually sway them around. It takes time. It's not because it bothers me that they dislike me, it's but because I just want them to like my class and have a chance at success, because when they hate me, they they tend to not want to do their work, and when they don't want to do their work, they're going to fail. \n\n\nI should clarify that I teach students who come from not the best backgrounds, most are on some sort of pell grant, and so getting them to have a sense of community in my class is what breeds the best learning environment. 
22	bettering yo life?	I‚Äôve recently felt very depersonalized with little motivation to do anything besides sleeping. I know this happens to the vast majority of ENFPs, so what are some things you all do or changes you make to help get yourself out of this funk?\n\nI hope everyone is having a great day <3 
13	For myself the best advice is to start.  Start moving.  Get out of your room.  Get out of your house.  Hang out with someone.  Anything that changes the cycle of you focusing all your energy on how upset you are.  \n\nIt's hard for all of us sometimes.  Have faith in yourself to get through it and if you can't find that faith: fake it until you make it.  Best of luck friend
8	I've been there for the past 6 months. I have bodily limitations so my case is a little different. I'm adjusting to an entirely new lifestyle that is 180¬∞ different from my previous one.\n\nI keep going because I have faith that the things chaining me down can't hold back my indomitable spirit forever. These chains will rust and shatter before my will does.\n\nTry to give yourself a pep talk. No need to be harsh, just acknowledge the light bursting from within your heart. Acknowledge the power of your Love. Acknowledge the fact that so long as you draw a breath, you will find a way out of the funk.\n\nAbove all. Be patient. Our skillset drains us from time to time. It's okay to be in a funk for a while, your batteries need time to recharge.\n\nSometimes it feels like there's no time to take for yourself. It feels like you're Atlas carrying the weight of the entire world upon your shoulders. That you single handedly, must hang the Sun in the sky every day. \n\nI promise, there's a tomorrow, no matter how far away it seems right now.\n\nRest, my friend. 
8	I'm in the same funk right now.. but thanks for the high hopes for the day and reassurance that I'm not alone!
6	If you have an instagram and/Facebook account, delete the apps ! Really try to distance yourself from social media (even reddit... but it‚Äôs not on the level of those apps). \n\nRead ‚ÄúIntuitive Being‚Äù - really appreciate who you are, honor yourself, it‚Äôs an amazing book.\n\nI am a visual person, idk about you. I have a white board up in my room where I write ‚Äúyou will do x this week‚Äù ‚Äúyou are smart, driven, amazing,‚Äù etc.\nIt sounds very cheesy but I promise you, manifesting and writing these things out will be really helpful.\n\nTry to go on walks outside (in pretty nature if you have access)! \n\nDownload food recipe apps (Runtasty has videos) and try to eat fruits and veggies and good quality sources of fat- salmon, sardines, fish in general, organic chicken, etc. Remember- your gut is your second brain! You have more serotonin neurotransmitters in your gut than your brain. Food = medicine. \n\nPractice meditation/mindfulness. Don‚Äôt feel bad if you only get around twice a week, it‚Äôs better than not doing it at all. Headspace has a great 10day free beginner course. Do all 10 days! And then download Insight Timer for thousands of free meditations, music, podcasts, all related to mindfulness.  \n\nIs there a reason your bed is more interesting than life right now? We‚Äôve all been there, but try to discover why that is. Self reflection is really good here. I benefitted a ton from therapy. You may too. \n\nPS- you can create alarm clocks on your phone that say nice things to wake up. Mine say ‚ÄúWake up beautiful! ‚ú®üå∏‚Äù and it makes it nice to read in the morning. 
10	Happens when you feel stuck and uninspired. My quick fix is blasting epic music to wake up, then onto a hot shower. Then go out side and run a lap. Works everytime. How you start is how you end üòÅ
3	My New Year's Resolution is "just fucking try".I haven't worn makeup to work in 8 years. This past month? Every day. Even did my hair. When I look good, I feel good I have found out. It certainly doesn't have to be what I'm doing, but just fucking try. That's what's working for me!
2	sounds like someone I know, but constant movement is key even when you don't want to. Writing has helped me a lot to conceptualize what I'm actually thinking. thinking about something other than yourself, having a vision and workout out routinely I have benefitted from. Everyone's situations are different but stay strong and try to understand yourself or the cause if there is one.
1	I force myself to get out from home, then I go walking in my town hoping to meet someone to interact with so that I can focus my energy elsewhere, rather than wasting it on feeling demotivated. The best helper is to put my favourite playlist and I get a shower. In a matter of minutes, I suddenly feel like Tony Manero, ready to go out :-)\n\nIt _usually_ works for me. When it doesn't, I go out anyway: it can't get worse.
1	Sounds like Depression.  Maybe talk to a therapist.
1	Finding myself in a weird triangle at work. What do you make of this situation?	I got into this weird triangle at work unbeknownst to me. Two men recently started in higher positions. One about 2 months ago and one this week. The one that started 2 months ago, Tom [42M] has been constantly flirting with me but also playing these hot and cold games. At first I wasn‚Äôt sure he was flirting bc it wasn‚Äôt so direct but it‚Äôs been everything in the book. Calling me princess, asking if my job is to stand there and look good, making a ton of inside jokes, touching my shoulder and knee when he talks to me, always making fun of me, and constantly poking fun at my interactions with other men. I really like him on many levels but anytime I try to put myself out there subtly, I feel he doesn‚Äôt bite. \n\nThen, Eric [38 M] who started this week and is married with kids.. just straight up asks for my #, asks to get drinks after work, and I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs all work related NBD. And then after drinks, he texts me about how lucky my BF is to have me, that I‚Äôm cute and down to earth. Eric drove me home and Tom texted me asking if we held hands on the way home. \n\nReally weird. At work I‚Äôm very friendly to Eric, platonically as I am with everyone. But bc I like Tom, he makes me super nervous and I don‚Äôt talk to him unless spoken to. I don‚Äôt say hello, goodbye nothing. He usually will strike up conversation with me and we‚Äôll banter from there. For a while Tom was sharing my desk but stopped sitting there. One day I told Eric it was empty and he could sit there, Tom over heard and everyday makes a joke about me giving away his spot. \n\nWtf is going on. I‚Äôm really not the kind of girl this happens to but they both seem to love my personality and want to be around me constantly. Tom has me chase him a bit but when we‚Äôre around each other it‚Äôs non stop, winking, joking, leaning in to me, telling me personal things, but never makes any kind of move. We have off the charts chemistry. I think we have made like 15 inside jokes already. Today I see him and it‚Äôs like it never happened....
3	I get creepy vibes about both of them from your description, to be honest. More importantly, getting involved with people from work, especially married people you work with, is a bad idea.  \n\nIt feels good when people flirt with you, find you attractive, but don't let that feeling put you in a position where you risk your financial security to feel desired. I'd be aloof, keep everything professional, and definitely not encourage these guys.  
14	Liking other extroverts is hard	it's not insecurity because you know you are awesome, but so is the other person, and they probably know a lot of other people that know they are too and because they know them for longer time it's not your fault that they just like someone else, and even if they don't, they have such an easy time meeting other people and if for some unfortunate reason they end up spending more time with that someone else they would fall for them before they get to fall for the awesome you, but there's no way you can blame them or yourself, and so life is just unfortunate like that. 
10	Stick with INTJs ;)
7	Motherfucker, let me get a word in!\n\n-Me to almost every other extrovert\n\n\nYou‚Äôre quiet. I like that. \n\n-Me to almost every other introvert\n\n
2	Agreed, it really sucks 
1	My deepest friendships tends to be with introverts too. I like extroverts. I guess the INTJ & INFJ types really match with me 
1	I love extroverts, but it never works out with me and them. \n\nFor me relationships with introverts are much more rewarding and natural. 
9	When did you discover to be a ENFP? How did you feel?	Hi there, new to this sub (and almost my very first post on reddit).\n\nWell, I'm 42 and I disocovered this MBTI/ENFP thing less than a week ago, since then, I'm still (positively) shocked!\n\nIt all started with a test on the 16personalities website. When I've read the "result", I was amazed: for the first time I was reading something very deep about me and on how I feel or relate with the outside world. Best of all, I'm not alone, there's people that acts/thinks/feels very similar to me?! Wow!\nI suddenly opened reddit, and found this subreddit (and the related others).\nReally, sometimes I cry by *emotions* when I read comments or post that in some way I might have written myself.\n\nHow it went to you?
5	Hey, welcome! :)\n\nI took the 16personalities test, too, but was got INFP as a result. At first I was fairly happy with it, because it covered a lot of stuff I thought was a good fit. Being a long term Redditor, I checked out the INFP subreddit (which is beautiful!) and I noticed they described a lot of tendencies I didn't quite fit in. Especially their satisfactions with just doing stuff in their head and reflecting on emotions instead of having ideas and get started on different hobbies and activities (finishing them is another pair of shoes lol). \n\nThrough the /r/mbti sidebar I read a lot of stuff about functions and how the tests actually work (hint: they dont work very good). I figured very fast, that _NFP was a perfect fit, and after a while I realized I'm in fact an E, too. 
3	I filled it out a couple months ago and was like, "woah, this makes a lot of sense." \n\nThe more I read the more accurate I realized it was. I purchased "The ENFP Survival Guide" which was exceptional. \n\nI was like, "yeap, that's me." But I also learned a lot too + tips for fulfillment. 
3	I found out a couple of weeks ago. I was surprised to be an E - I'm one of the quietest people I know - and relieved  - I can see what I need to do to get out of the hole I been in for far too long and get my life moving.\n\nI've dipped in and out of MBTI for several years and realised the tests aren't that accurate. And too many of the descriptions are stereotypical. Understanding the cognitive functions helped me realise what I'm not but not what I am. All the Ixxx types I tested as felt like putting on a coat that didn't fit properly.\n\nI spent a couple of weeks binge watching typology on YouTube in the new year. What was most helpful for me to work out I was an ENFP was understanding the shadow side of the type - the superpowers and darker traits. Also the idea of Saviour functions (from Dave Powers at Objective Personality) where some people bypass the auxiliary function and use their tertiary function more - which explains why I've often tested as a T rather than F.\n\nAnd happy to know there's people kind of like me out there - thanks r/ENFP :)
3	it actually helped me SO much. i'm 20 (so you can imagine how intense is this age for an enfp) and i always felt like i did a lot of things wrong and not knowing how to fix them really stressed me up through my whole adolescence.\n\ntaking the test and discovering i'm an enfp gave me a sense of comfort that i had never ever felt; i suddenly felt surprisingly understood and accompanied. i discovered the test at a time of my life when i was learning to deal with my personality, so it really helped me to put a name to all those things i have felt or done, either good or "bad". it gave me a starting point to knowing myself better, and a boost to improve and work on myself also! it really changed my life tbh.\n\nit also made me love myself, for real. we have such an extraordinary personality but, a quite heavy weight comes with it. i'm totally willing to carrying that weight, because even though being an enfp can be the most stressful thing ever, the rewards are immense <3
2	I am happy for you! But I want to caution that tests are unreliable. You really should study the cognitive functions and figure it out yourself.\n\nhttps://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/if-youre-confused-about-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-read-this-an-intro-to-cognitive-functions/\n\nThen this cognitive function based description of ENFP: https://www.typeinmind.com/nefi/\n\n
2	I had the same experience when I took the test. Now I‚Äôm more aware of how other people in my life may be on the MB personality scale. Happy to have you in the club! (It‚Äôs so entertaining and insightful to see what others post here)
7	mbtis you just don't click with?	first off, i want to say while yes every person is unique and their mbti doesn't account entirely for they are, i notice that my friends with the same mbtis are also very similar in personality. (idk about character) that being said, there are certain people with the same mbti that i seem to not be able to click with, like:\n\n1. intj (ironic, but i just can't stand them)\n2. eXtp (sometimes i see thru their manipulation)\n3. istp (they're very critical)\n\nthe mbtis i'm able to click with are:\n\n1. esfj (their loyalty and friendliness)\n2. infp (i have so many close infp friends)\n3. infj (have only met one and love her)\n4. istj (we're polar opposites but we just work)\n5. esfp (tbh they make great friends)\n\nthe trend being i prefer people that rely on feeling than thinking. they could be intuitive or observant, they could be an introvert or an extrovert, they could rely on perceiving or judging. those that rely on feeling usually present themselves as friendly and understanding so that's probably why. and all the enfps rave about intjs but ohman personally i think they're too rigid and prideful. do y'all agree or am i alone in this
7	>intj (ironic, but i just can't stand them)\n\nWhat in INTJs can you not stand?\n\n----\n\n>eXtp (sometimes i see thru their manipulation)\n\nSounds like weak / tertiary Fe for both the ESTP and ENTP, these two types suck at Fe but they feel energized by it and thus overestimate themselves.\n\n>istp (they're very critical)\n\nENFPs and ISTPs have reverse function orders. ^(I put these 8 functions in 4 groups in a reason that will become apparent soon.)\n\n* ENFP is (Ne-Fi) and weaker (Te-Si) with Shadow (Ni-Fe) and even more stressful (Ti-Se) \n \n* ISTP is (Ti-Se) and weaker (Ni-Fe) with Shadow (Te-Si) and even more stressful (Ne-Fi)\n\nCertain shadow functions stress us out, and certain shadow functions we are actually kind of good in we just do not value those two shadow functions as much as our main functions.\n\nNotice with an ENFP the two shadow functions that stress you out are the two strongest functions for an ISTP and vice versa.  This is the reason why ESTPs and ISTPs sometime annoy / frustrate ENFPs and vice versa.\n\nBut it goes even more than that with specifically ISTPs.  Your 3rd function so Te with ENFPs and Ni with ISTPs.  Well it has a shadow version with opposite introversion / extroversion energies.  So Ti with ENFPs and Ne with ISTPs.\n\nWell this 3rd function but with opposite introversion / extroversion energies.  Well you are weak in it, just like you are weak in your tetriary function.  But while your tertiary function energizes you, this other function with opposite introversion / extroversion energies drains you the most.  In socionics this is called the POLR, the point of least resistance where you wish you did not have to use this function as often as you actually have to do in daily life.  You intellectually understand the value of Ti for an ENFP and Ne for an ISTP, but each time it comes up it grates on you and often if you had godlike genie powers you could shift a couple things in the environments, or society, or in the preferences of other people and suddenly you will be using Ti for an ENFP a little less and it will seem so much better like this is the way society is meant to be, why can't society be a little more understanding, a little more forgiving, yadda, yadda, yadda.  Socionics calls these two relationships relationships of "conflict" / "conflictary"  the similar relationship of conflict with my type the INTJs are with the ESFJs.\n\nENFPs and ISTPs can learn to appreciate each other but it requires them to be in an equal relations in the environment, and it requires them not to try to critique each other, challenge each other, or criticize each other.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSorry if I annoyed you.  I hope you have a good day =)
2	I like to think I can get along with anyone, but xSxx types are harder for me to be able to connect with
2	I find it hard to deal with people who are overly cautious. \n\nI find it hard to deal with people who believe in conspiracy theories.\n\nAnd i find it hard to deal with people who are evangelical Christians. \n\nAre there mbti types for these kinds of people?
2	I just find it hard to connect with sensors sometimes, and thinkers as well. Usually the less flexible someone is, the less I get along with them, so I guess that means judgers, thinkers, and sensors in general hahaha. however it usually doesn't bother me unless they start to enforce their beliefs on others. If someone respects how I think and approach the world, I can do the same for them. I also get annoyed with people who are extremely competitive or rigid. I try to look for the good in people though, and remember that every personality type has its strengths and weaknesses. like ESFJ's, I can find their overbearing nature pretty obnoxious, but I know that beneath that is a great heart for people. and ESTP's I can find a bit stubborn and domineering, but they are also hella exciting and weirdly perceptive. and INTJ's are sometimes closed off and think too highly of themselves, but if you listen to them they are often right about a lot of stuff that they have spent huge amounts of time contemplating.\n\n I think in general its probably more of a healthy/unhealthy thing than a type thing for me. If someone is secure in themselves and wants the best for themselves and those around them, I tend to be cool with them.
1	I can‚Äôt click with ESTJs. My manager is an ESTJ (literally the worst position in my life for an ESTJ to be! and she drives me nuts. I have a difficult time connecting with Sensors in general, but some of my best friends are sensors. It‚Äôs just a completely different kind of connection. I bond more deeply with introverted intuitives in general, and extroverted intuitives shortly after. Even tho ENTJs are kind of annoying sometimes too.
1	Every ESFP I have known is just disappointing, they constantly talk about themselves and are just to shallow for me. 
1	Never know any istp, and istj / isfj is abit too dry for me
0	I haven‚Äôt really not gotten along with any specific type. One of my closest friends is an ISTJ, my bf is an ENTJ, INFJ‚Äôs are wonderful, ESFP‚Äôs are amazingly kind and sweet, INFP‚Äôs are wonderfully deep...I suppose if there‚Äôs one type I didn‚Äôt like, it‚Äôs an ESTP‚Äîhowever, it‚Äôs super unfair to generalize a sample size of one.

18	ENFP personal growth	Hi ENFP friends! I found this article yesterday and I feel like it changed my entire way of approaching life... great read, really really helpful. [http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ENFP\_per.html](http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ENFP_per.html)
1	many thanks for sharing thisüôèüèª
1	Yeah. This.
1	Thank you :) 
3	Critical Role	Any of you beautiful nerds watch Critical Role (the weekly D&D stream on Twitch with incredible voice actors which I won't name as this parenthesis is getting longer and longer as I keep typing)?\n\nI don't have any rl friends who watch it and it'd be cool to watch it together on Discord or something if you handsome devils are up to it! üí™
3	I don't watch it, but I finished the balance arc of The Adventure Zone recently and am looking to fill the void!!
3	Yessss I‚Äôm obsessed with it! I even have the bumper sticker!
2	Yes yes yes!!! I'm actually so excited that another ENFP from here watches it üòÅ I had to stop watching for a while so I lagged way behind... but I'm making my way back üò§ currently on Ep 24!!!
1	No, but I've been seeing a lot of fan art for it, thinking of checking it out üôÇ
1	I've never watched Critical Role, but I greatly enjoyed Titansgrave and Shadowrun: Corporate Sins.\n\nI also enjoyed The Gamers 2: Dorkness Rising, although I can't recommend the other movies in the Gamers franchise.
80	DAE feel extremely guilty returning food, even when it's justified?	
21	Yeah, we‚Äôre great at realizing shit happens and people make mistakes. Most of all, we understand that most things aren‚Äôt that serious and don‚Äôt need to be dramatic. I‚Äôve only sent back a chicken salad once bc the chicken wasn‚Äôt fully cooked. 
10	Also, I feel extremely uncomfortable when I‚Äôm eating out with somebody who has no problem returning food or complaining about something, even if their complaint is legitimate. Like, unless the food has become inedible in some way, just eat it!
3	I worked in restaurants as a cool for 2 years, a server for 6 and a manager for 3 before moving on to a career with no weekends and late nights. I have absolutely no problem sending food back and neither should anyone else. Delivery is harder, but in the restaurant itself there are so many ways to do it politely and nicely. But I'm paying money and have chosen to go out either to celebrate something or to avoid the inconvenience of cooking at home. I don't see anything wrong with asking to receive the item you asked for and are paying for.\n\n If you brought your car to the mechanic for an oil change and instead they changed a tire, wouldn't you say something? If you went to the hospital to get a mole checked out and instead they did a strep test, wouldn't you say something? There's never any reason to be embarrassed and the only way it's going to hurt anyone's feelings is if you do it rudely. A simple "Excuse me, this didn't come out as I ordered it, would you mind asking the kitchen to make it again please?" is all that it takes. 
2	Yes. I‚Äôve only ever done it once and my heart was pounding 
2	In general, I dont like imposing inconveniences regardless of the situation so I can relate but when it comes to eating out, I will either eat it or throw in the towel.  I would prefer to not give anyone a reason to fuck with my food.  I've had several food service jobs and seen people do some foul shit to customers' food.    
2	I can very much relate.. But those texts are great and hysterical! Made my morning.
2	I'm the same way. I order pretty much the same breakfast by my job and always order cheddar. 3 times in a row, they used american. I always find out when I'm ready to eat. One time I asked the lady at the register to check and sure enough, it's the wrong cheese. She asked if I wanted to change it and I said no, it's ok. I felt bad about bringing it to her attention. It happens when the usual cook isnt there. It still tastes good... 
1	X-post from r/pics, don't want to take credit!
220	Truth	
21	Do I buy a new amplifier? New handgun? Art stuff? A car? Guitar hardware? Weight equipment? Food? Drugs? All 8???? \nNope. Just college tuition.\nI need some adderall.

10	An everyday struggle..
8	I cant press either button 
4	I literally just bought a couch..
5	We got our oldest kid a Nintendo Switch for Christmas. Been playing Legend of Zelda - Breath of the Wild a ton myself and it‚Äôs been a very satisfying experience. As an unexpected bonus it‚Äôs been keeping me occupied and away from my usual meanderings with projects online and the inevitable, related expenditures. My credit card statement this month is way down.

1	Absolutelynotmeirl
1	On the fence about a motorbike üòÇ
1	Not for me lol I tend to be like, super aware of my finances and I‚Äôd rather hoard it than spend it üòú
1	I‚Äòm actually quite engaged in the zero waste lifestyle and trying to live more minimal, so that doesn‚Äôt apply for me. 
0	Can't relate. I'm so scared of getting into debt that I basically never buy anything non-essential over ¬£20.
0	I‚Äôm too future focused not to press the financially stable button. Too much American the world is ending when will the next depression be anxiety. 
-1	This is a consumerist issue and nothing to do with being ENFP.
9	Sometimes Im afraid...	...that I will start to sign the song Im hearing in my earphones loudly when Im in some public place or in the bus or something. Im so drawn by the song sometimes, I want to start singing immediately and in the last minute I realise I shouldnt because there are people around :D Happens to you too sometimes?
4	I sing it anyways. Sometimes I'll bust a move. No one will judge you, trust me, if anything they'll want to emulate the lack of self conciousness. 
1	Never with singing, all the time with dancing! I'll be tapdancing (minus the actual shoes) before I know it. :')
1	Yes yes!! I got kicked out of class for accidently whisper/singing too loud when I was in 10th grade. My math teacher hated me though, it was well known.
6	Making decisions is excruciating	Hello!\n\nSo, first off, I am an ENFP and I'm also diagnosed with ADHD, and anxiety and other stuff lol. That information informs this post...\n\nI was just wondering if any of y'all have extreme difficulties making decisions. Like, even simple decisions about what to say in an e-mail, or what to watch on Netflix, or what to order at a restaurant. I can spend thirty minutes fine-tuning an e-mail or trying to decide what to eat. I know this is probably just how Ne manifests, but if y'all had any suggestions on what you've done to help with this, that would be great. It causes me a great deal of discomfort and anxiety to make decisions.\n\n&#x200B;
5	yeah man, that is Ne, brainstorming, seeing all the possibilities, creating new ones, and you will do with this everything that you do. I will analyze like crazy what I want to eat for dinner, going around the grocery store a few times over, then I just don't get anything and just go hungry.  I will overthink which project I want to work on first, since I have 10 I want to do right now, all at once, to the point I do not work on anything. \n\nWhat helps me, is to just make a decision and remember how I can do more things afterwards if that decision was not so great. Like right now I am focusing on learning how to code and then I can focus more on writing my first book. That way I can brainstorm all the possibilities for learning code, instead of brainstorming possibilities in general.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNe is always analyzing everything. \n\nI was watching a movie last night and instead of paying attention to what was being said, I start analyzing what they are wearing and start to muse if people really dressed like that, and then I start thinking about how Hollywood ruins everything authentic, and then I am like, wait, what did he say?\n\n&#x200B;
3	maybe you could take a second, when faced with it, to think about why you‚Äôre anxious about making that particular decision. are you afraid of missing out on the other thing once you make a choice? are you afraid your choice isn‚Äôt good enough?\n\nwhat i found is a kind of relieving and kind of disappointing reality check: you‚Äôre going to miss out on 99.9% of things no matter what you do. the best thing to do is to just go for it.\n\nif you‚Äôre at a restaurant chances are you‚Äôll like whatever you choose. no matter what you choose, you are going to miss out on the others. and that‚Äôs okay! if you liked what you ate you can always take a note of what else you wanted to try and come back another time! if it‚Äôs an email, you can just write out the first things that come to your mind, and then edit it until it is clear, defined, and polite! if the recipient doesn‚Äôt understand they might ask to clarify or you can always reply again and make your point clear!\n\njust breathe and take a step back if you feel like you‚Äôre struggling with a decision. even if it‚Äôs for 30 seconds. i hope that helps!
2	I actually listened to a TED podcast about decision-making yesterday. It might not help you directly with your issue but maybe you might pick up some useful tidbits about the psychology regarding how decisions are made.\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/519264798/decisions-decisions-decisions 
1	Try putting 2 choices on a coin flip. Heads one choice, tails the other. Then in mid-air you will feel in your gut which you want it to be. or when you see the result you will be happy or disappointed. Either way will tell you what you really want.
1	INTJ here and I can identify somewhat. I can be kind of perfectionistic in making decisions and I tend to draw out my decision process.\n\nOne thing I‚Äôve found helpful is understanding that I get the feedback I need from just making decisions themself. Meaning I learn more about what works and doesn‚Äôt work and what I want, like, and need from just taking action and weeding out the bad decisions as I go.  Rather than trying to make the ‚Äúperfect best‚Äù decisions before I start. \n\n\nMy 0.02$
1	BRO me too. read this, it helped me so SO much\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ENFP\_per.html](http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ENFP_per.html)
1	I can totally relate.\nSometimes my girlfriend goes like "do you want to do this or that?" and I usually reply "GIRL YOU GAVE ME TWO PATHS WHY DID YOU DO THIS TO ME, YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS"!\n\nI'm slowly learning to do what a psychology teacher suggested me: when it comes to decisions, overanalyzing the situations and the outcomes could cause paralysis. Instead, try to listen to your gut feeling (Fi?) and most of the times it will be a choice you won't regret.\n\nTry to listen to your body, your belly, wherever you usually feel anxiety and stuff maybe. You will be surprised how many signals it will bring! It's a matter of training, and I'm training it, and I can see this gut feeling clarity grows stronger and stronger.\n\nHave a great day! :))
1	Yep. I spent like 40 minutes in the chapstick aisle comparing the ingredients, advertisment, color, brand..etc. I met a couple really friendly people that influenced one of my major purchase decisions ;) 
57	ENFP in a nutshell! Lol	
14	Anyone else overcome this? I‚Äôm never late anymore, almost always early now. Just made life unnecessarily difficult and keeping my word became much more important. Not trying to rain in the meme-party btw...carry on :) 
5	I think its safe to say that there should be a ENFP merch site. Because need.
3	A wizard is never late, nor are we early, we arrive precisely when we mean to.
2	no.
1	I'm never late. I'm almost always early...I used to drive an hour each way for work...the day started at 7:00AM and I was always there 30 minutes early.
1	School? Yeah always. Anything else however I'm almost always early because when I was a kid my mom would make sure we would be 15 minutes early to anything.
2	IM NOT A MIND READER	do people constantly tell you "IM NOT A MINDREADER"  ??\n\ni have been hearing this a lot lately.  maybe i always have and just never noticed.\n\nironically i hate when i feel like somebody is being vague and depending on me to read their mind. \n\nIs this an ENFP thing?
6	I don't know if it's an ENFP thing per say but maybe that's why intuitives interact better with other intuitives, especially Ne and Ni. While one is giving pieces of information that is either incomplete or non-linear, the other is able to piece them together without needing all the pieces in linear order by getting the gist. My 2 cents.
29	Distractions	
63	When you‚Äôre mad a friend but still keep up communication	
8	This is one of your best qualities in a weird way. My ENFP BFF always does this, and that's why we got so close.
5	Oh yes, this completely 
145	An insatiable curiosity to understand other's minds?	I'm wondering if this is typical or a "me" thing.\n\nI get obsessed with diving deep into people's mind when I get to know someone. I want to know what their mind is made of, why they think and feel the way they do, how they react to things. It's not necessarily to help them better, or even to relate, just because I like to *know* them the most I possibly can and relate that knowledge to information I've gathered from context, previous conversations or outside cues. Just satisfying my own selfish curiosity.\n\nApparently curiosty drives ENTP to prank people or act like assholes just to see how people will react, and so I wonder if my habit might be a Ne-Fi counterpart to that? 
21	I definitely do this but not necessarily because I actually care about the other person's mind, it's just my way of getting to know them. I'm not trying to forge a connection with everyone I know but I'd like to actually KNOW the people around me if that makes sense. ENFP here btw. My ENTP partner does the same but he asks very different questions. 
13	This is the passion that drives most of my life decisions hahahaha
10	Oh my God. Yes. I don't even have to like a person to do this. Some people just fascinate me, and I get obsessed with trying to figure out exactly what makes them tick. Ill even play guessing games with myself, trying to predict what they'll say or do in response to different situations. I've gobbled up everything I can find about psychology, just so that I can try and get into people's minds better. Like you said, not to help them, or even hinder them, but because of some innate, obsessive curiosity. \n\nThe weird thing is, I'm not even an overly curious person, at least not to this degree, about anything else. Just certain people, and how their minds work.
7	1000000% !!!! always thinking about others motivations and thoughts and stuff. never to use to manipulate really though, but it helps me interact more effectively with people. and i just really love knowing the human mind in its many variations:)
5	CAN RELATE! My DH is an intp and finds it incredibly annoying that I feel the NEED to know everything about every angle about what he's thinking (and why he's thinking it) at all times. 
4	Yes!! I think it makes you a really good student in anything that requires learning. In sports, in classes, in theories, anything. \n\nIt has it‚Äôs downfalls tho. Even if i don‚Äôt want to be their friend, sometimes I find strangers talking to me and they ask questions, I reply and ask my own. It‚Äôs a good trait but has it‚Äôs negative sides like accidentally making weirdos think you‚Äôre interested in being friends.. Like, ‚Äúbrain shut up and walk away, you don‚Äôt have to find out about everything‚Äù 
3	An INTJ here, I've noticed this as an ENFP & ENTP trait where it will be geared more towards the variable of relationship building and the value the person may or may not have told the ENFP. It's definitely a rating system but an internal one. Although for ENFP all relationships are important and others believe they are just as important but ENFPs know who their persons are. \n\nENTPs do the same with information but the difference is they throw out thought bombs to see what happens out of curiosity and get them in trouble or a reputation. ENFPs throw out them feels bombs asking no boundary questions and sometimes get more than they bargained for but that's the excitement of it right? \n\nINTJs & INFJs do the same thing but instead of using bombs we're using lasers to slice out all the erroneous data to get to individual decision code or feeling motivations if you're an INFJ. We will never reveal our observations though. 
3	Yes 1000%. This is partially why I went into clinical social work (aka counseling and social work).
3	With our Ne and Fi we can see possibilities and can imagine how we would feel in any situation. We can walk in anyone's shoes and see every perspective. We can figure out how a person could get to that way of thinking and understand it, even if we don't agree at all. It's one of our super powers. And getting into someone's mind and how they think is rewarding because it can conform our hypothesis as well as allow us better understanding of their point of view. We crave to understand people, how they think and why. We want to know who they are.
2	I‚Äôm like this. It drives a lot of people away so as I‚Äôve aged I‚Äôve tried to get a handle on it and place a lot of importance in boundaries. \n\n\nJust because we want to know something doesn‚Äôt mean we should. 
2	I *want* to do this all the time, but I don't feel like most people open up in the way I want and it leaves me dissatisfied, so I only dig when I think I'm gonna get something.
1	I relate!
1	Yep. But not only the particular people, but also the humans in general. That's why I was really thinking of studying the cognitive silence. That would be a great opportunity to dive into that topic
1	I'm not this passionate about it but I often try to figure out peoples moral standings by asking them philosophical and metaphorical questions. It's just (part of) how I get to know people.
1	This is me 100% - whether they‚Äôre strangers, people I know or even people on tv lol I wish I could just pop inside their brains for a second to just understand their thought processes
1	ENTP here, and I relate massively.
1	Yes I like to get to know people's thoughts when I suspect it'll match their demeanor, which, it usually seems to.\n\nI like to know if I'm interested, if I'm stuck with them like on a bus, if I want to play, make a friend etc. Yes
1	Yes I do this all the time! I am so fascinated with people and how people work! Even with people I don't like. I tend to try to figure out how their minds work and how they think and feel. When they do things that seem hurtful I tend to go back on the information I gathered about why they do that. For people I like I use it to my advantage on how I can make that person feel loved. It's why this personality thing fascinates me so much. I am just curious about people in general. 
1	There's nothing as interesting as digging deep into somebody's personality! There's so much to discover - so many different sides and hidden nooks and crannies. That said, I usully seem to gravitate more towards other intuitives with this personality expedition of mine. 
1	Normal
2	Crushing on Enfj girl	Hey guys, I just went to have some coffee with and enfj girl and I had such a great time! She couldn't stop playing around with her coffee cup and she asked lots of fun questions like when do I wanna marry and stuff, I think we have a good vibe going and I'm looking forward to going out as a date with her next time! \n\n So yeah guys, any tips and any warnings, also any enfp traits that I should be careful about with enfjs? Also any expierence you have with enfjs\nLove yall
7	Be yourself and enjoy. But be the best version of yourself. And as far as ENFP specifics go, be direct, attentive, and on time. Don‚Äôt over-accommodate or think to much for the other person. Really show that you listen and aren‚Äôt just bouncing off the walls the time, as cute as that can be. Let yourself get excited and passionate when talking about the things that are important to you.
1	Just be yourself, as honestly as possible.\n\nI‚Äôve been dating my enfj boyfriend for 6 months :). It‚Äôs a swell combination. \n\nCommunication is key!
10	The 16 types in college (based on stereotypes mostly but funny) (she is ENFP!)	
3	I only saw after that she is an ENFP. Of course she is being able to see the perspective of all the types and imbibe them. She has a few other ones too including the types at a party and as RPG game characters in a selection screen which is hilarious.
2	I love her videos! However, in her "Thoughts about INTJs, ENTJs, ENTPs and INTPs" video she states that she is an ENTP. 
2	I related way too hard at this
99	Do you fall hard and fast?	I don't know if this is an ENFP thing - I don't always have someone I like, but when I do, I seem to fall for them very quickly and harder than I would like.  It's like the rational part of my brain is saying, "slow down, take your time, don't give all your emotions to this person yet," but I can't stop it.  Usually it ends with my heart being broken in some way or another, unfortunately.  I saw a meme this year that was so spot on - it was in reference to getting a crush on someone: "DANGER! Not only will this kill you, but it will hurt the whole time you're dying."  That pretty much sums it up.\n\nI wish I could be a more rational person regarding these things and protect myself more, but at the same time, I feel like that would require shutting myself off, and I don't want to be that way.  Do any of you guys relate to this dilemma?  I feel like my only options are to be easily hurt or cold-hearted so that no one can get in.  I've done the latter before, and it's no fun either.
31	dude.... I feel you. For me though it has to do more with falling for the wrong GUYS. I seem to always settle for the nice, but emotionally unavailable guys with unresolved issues from the past. But the funny thing is, they'll portray themselves as sure of what they want, and later down the road shit just goes down the drain. I don't know why I keep dating the same type of doods. And what's funnier is that the type of guy that I've always desired were always the complete opposite of the ones I dated luls. I guess I need to change the crowd I surround myself with... 
16	I totally get this! I've been in your situation so many times. And honestly I ended up not only hurting myself but others (professing adoration too early when in fact I just love the feeling and idea of love etc etc).\n\n\nIt is a good idea to try and control these emotions. I know you said it feels like you're shutting yourself off, but it's about balance. You're not shutting your emotions off, but rather trying to be more introspective and consider what those emotions really are. Falling hard for people isn't a bad thing necessarily, but when it's not handled properly it can become unhealthy. You know from your experience that falling for someone and just becoming totally absorbed by those feelings ends badly, so next time you want to try and manage those emotions. Not matter how loud the voice is in your head telling you to jump headfirst, take it slowly. You can still feel as much as you do, but every now and then take a moment to remind yourself that you're an independent person.\n\n\n It takes work but it can be helpful to find the right person too. The girl I'm with now isn't always super lovey-dovey and soft. She is at her core, but she doesn't express it much - it's more like her to jokingly mock me than say something  sweet (when appropriate of course). This was really good for me, as it helped stop me from just becoming a broken record of the same romantic garbage I've spewed in my last relationships, and actually establish something beyond that between us. \n\n\nI don't know if this helps much. But basically, reflecting on and managing your emotions isn't shutting them off. You need to become comfortable with controlling your emotions, rather than letting them control you. It is just a step on the way to being a healthier ENFP, imo.\n
14	I can fall hard for someone after just a 30 minute conversation.
13	I do. I have crushes that come like a tsunami and in some days they are gone bc I got a negative response. But I also have borderline personality disorder, so idk which one makes me like this xD\n\nTbh, you don't have to be rational to protect your feelings, listening to your Fi (that voice "slow down, take your time, don't give all your emotions to this person yet") helps, takes time but well... We learn.\n\nWhen I realize I have a crush on someone I just open up and tell them, so I know if I should move on or not :P
9	Man this is too relatable. The problem is I don't want to change, because I know for a fact when the right person comes, feeling this way going into it will hopefully be a great feeling to have, knowing that I didn't withhold anything and the other person felt the same way
7	It takes me awhile to actually know if I like someone. I don‚Äôt really have crushes or are half in half out. But once I decide I do like someone, I‚Äôm basically already half way to falling in love with them. The only reason I have held back from falling too fast after deciding I‚Äôm into someone is because of trust issues and now I‚Äôm extremely cautious after some heartbreak.\n\nI‚Äôd say let yourself fall, it‚Äôs in your nature to move quickly. But don‚Äôt move so quickly that you scare your partner away, you just have to be understanding of the fact that some people don‚Äôt fall as fast as an ENFP would
6	u sir, just said what im going thru rn
7	Yes this was a struggle for me, but I found most of it was from wanting to be loved. \nWhen I started to crush on a girl, it was always someone who was not into me, so my sub mind saw this an ego trip that would increase my value.\nSo then it became a life or death situation to get her to love me, so I would put up with hot and cold abuse, pay their bills, take them out to eat, constantly be easily available to them.\nWhat got me to stop was being bored and feeling painful trapped emotions so that I would see the value I already had, the love from others that was always there in front of me.\nI learned that those girls did not deserve my love, it was my responsibility to set boundaries for myself about giving myself away.\nThen I learned of my gifts, then I got a dream to work on, then I was the one who the girls tried to win over. Then I started to chill out when I met some
4	For me, it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm very picky with who I like. So if I like someone, it‚Äôs because I feel like they are someone I could go all-out with comfortably. It doesn‚Äôt happen very often sadly :/
4	Yes, I tipsy-texted my boyfriend after 3 months of dating/knowing him that I wanted to marry him. Luckily we are still together 5 and a half years later but I do regret saying it so early. I didn‚Äôt want to come off as clingy. 
3	Always, but that's the thrill of the ride.
3	When it's on it's on, there's no pussyfooting around
2	This is pretty relatable. I was easily hurt for a very long time & am now the colder, closed off type of person. I'll periodically open up again, but I've been stung every time, so I'm just gonna live on my ice planet for a bit.
2	I completely relate. I've torpedoed so many relationships by rushing into things and getting hurt, all by myself really! I start obsessing over my crush, thinking about them all the time, and eventually feeling ashamed of thinking of them all the time. I realized it even was so bad that in their company, my mind might be totally blank from just feeling so glad to be with them. My whole identity seems to vanish and be consumed in them. And then I have an anxious-avoidant attachment style so that has been challenging--I'll smother someone with adoration and affection, and when they can't reciprocate my level of it, I get bitter and hurt or jealous, and then I avoid them. Being aware of it helps a lot, and this last relationship my friend was very understanding and didn't let herself get wrapped up in my issues, so she actually helped me get through it and we are very good friends now!\n\nFollow the advice of others here. Take time for yourself to be mindful and grounded, try to separate your feelings from your thoughts of this person. Try to really analyze what you like about them. I found out I liked that they liked me... and that was pretty much it. That helped me realize I didn't truly want to date them, I just enjoy the feeling of having a crush. I enjoy giving affection... so now we just do that with no strings attached. neither of us want to date so we just give affection and it's actually really great. Good luck! 
1	Same except since I‚Äôm a dude it‚Äôs woman that I actually like I fall too fast for and it usually doesn‚Äôt work out.
1	haha totally relate, i fall for guys so quickly that it's not even funny anymore. it used to be way worse, i could literally spend some time with some guy and crush on him immediately. i became a lot more guarded after i fell for my best friend and got rejected. i've been liking this other guy for quite some time now, but i've been trying to convince myself against it this whole time, by focusing on why i think it wouldn't work out between us and his flaws (?). it does help a bit because i don't put him on a pedestal and i can talk to him. lately i've been starting to avoid him because i'm scared to like him for real. it's funny how i get super awkward and non-flirty when this happens when my usual personality is full on banter and flirting haha. kinda sucks because i wish we could be closer and have more chemistry. he doesn't really take any initiative to talk to me more either so i don't think it's gonna work out :(
1	Yeah, I used to but its gotten waaaay better. Got diagnosed with BPD and ADD, and now that ive gotten tons of therapy and help, my emotions arent as wild anytime anything happens. Its really nice. I dont really see it as an ENFP thing.
1	Not since I embraced the Black Pill
1	I‚Äôm just so tickled because I can soooo relate!üíõ
1	Oh yes this completely. Fell sooo hard for my ex. It was epic. And.. now ex. ;( \n\nThat's the way it goes though, don't resist, just accept. It hurts searching for your ideal mate but one day you won't be heartbroken !
1	Lol, yeah my husband and I are both ENFPs... we got engaged after 2 months of dating üòÇ
1	God yes. All the time. I call it ‚Äúdiving in heart first‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs something I have to mindfully watch out for because I get hurt a lot because of it
1	Somewhat relate as an ENFP...\nI think I fall for someone pretty quick if they are compatible with my needs but I've just been hurt way too many times. Sometimes they can be "taken" after I feel interested or emotionally unstable. I just don't wanna get hurt anymore so I don't let my emotions "take" me. Idk if it's unhealthy but I lie to myself, tell myself these feelings aren't real, because I don't wanna feel hurt again. I  feel like we ENFPs are able to get over rejection pretty quickly tho and to move on so that's a good thing. I somewhat try to keep my "options" open now and tell myself only time can tell, I have to be patient, explore this person more before I can even begin to be interested in them. 
1	Crush, to fall for someone... these very definitions dont sound appealing if you you went through them once and know what its like. \nInstead, learn how to love without crushing. Learn how to love without falling.\nJust love, coneciously. Love with all your emotions and without shutting down. But keep your eyes, open! The moment you notice yourself regressing to your old patterns of falling for someone or crushing on someone. Dont guilt or blame yourself. Dont feel ashamed for being a human. Smile, its a learning process for you too. And once more, bring your attention to reality. Just love, with awarness. It will be awkward and painful sometimes, and thats when youll want to stay away or shut your eyes the most. Whatever you do, there is no right or wrong action, but stay aware. Aware of what is happening right now. Dont fall into guilt, dont fall into happiness dont fall into shame or hate or sadness. And mostly dont fall in love.  Instead learn how to rise out of. And then its a game. Fall a little bit, then rise a little bit. And youll soon begin to build your center, your balance, your wholeness. Maybe youll lose the attraction and affection you had. Thats only part of the process. In the new space you make, youll become equanimous(power word)-balanced, whole, and most importantly: healthy. 
1	Did I write this? lol
1	WHY R WE LIKE DIS
1	I rarely ever fall hard for someone, I can be half interested in someone but that never keeps me or makes me want to 'see' if it will work, I like things to happen unexpectedly and whimsical-ish.  
24	What‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs job/career?!?! Specifically if you are happy in it.	I, an ENFP obviously, feel pretty lost like 99% of the time. I worry that I‚Äôm in the wrong career. When I consider advancing my career or changing, I worry that I would get bored or dissatisfied with that. I also worry about never making a change and not living to my best potential. I have so many ideas, so many interests and not sure how to handle it. Just curious if there‚Äôs other ENFPs out there who feel similarly, and how you‚Äôve found a nice balance in your career, even if it‚Äôs just better work/life balance. Thanks!
6	Freelance digital marketer! I choose my clients, choose my hours, work anywhere in the world, travel all the time, and never do meetings or unnecessary phone calls. \n\n
4	Hey there! So I work as a Graphic Designer/Web Developer and Freelance Illustrator! I found that with my previous jobs I'd get deathly bored of whatever I was doing by around the 8 month mark and after that, I'd really start hating where I worked and never want to go in anymore.\n\nWith my current job I'm always working with different clients from a variety of industries. It keeps me on my toes and keeps the novelty craving part of my brain satisfied and it's something creative that I really enjoy. Theres never the same solution to any two problems. Gotta say it's probably my dream job tbh, and I'm very happy with my career. The freelance illustration is just fun too because again, its something different but still creative üëç\n\nPLUS it's the coolest thing ever seeing a transport truck with YOUR DESIGN on it. Ugh, amazing. :)
5	I‚Äôm in school to be a teacher because I get to talk to young minds and help guide them. Also I can be creative in the ways I go about teaching and making my classroom a fun environment to be in.
5	Hello! I'm a data scientist. If you have a strong interest in mathematics and programming, data science is so ideal for an ENFP since you have a wide variety of tasks to do: programming, web scraping, data pre-processing, machine learning modeling, data visualizations, communicating results, research, the list goes on. This wide variety makes it very rewarding to become a data scientist, especially if you develop solutions to problems that can really shape the well being of others through innovation and creativity. It is also an added bonus for the current high demand of data scientists and the great benefits associated with the position (: The only downside I would say is that it really takes a long time to acquire the credentials to become a promising data scientist. Typically, you would need a Master's degree, some number of years of experience with programming, a good mathematical foundation, and the ability to communicate your results.
4	Chemical engineer.\n\nLove it. Loved pursuing education that would be profitable after the '08 crash, loved doggedly getting what many consider the "hardest" undergrad degree. Now that I've been in the industry for some years, engineering\manufacturing is great for ENFPs because you can leverage your soft skills like no one else. There are millions of better equipment designers than me, but C-level executives love how I make relationships at all levels and can communicate anything.\n\nI write poetry and study literature pretty intensely outside of work and that's my passion, but I feel I have plenty of time to dedicate to it while also getting a good income with an interesting job. Once done with college I've constantly felt like I have a lot of free time for independent work or play since my day job doesn't follow me home.
4	Security! It took me awhile to find, but as it turns out standing in front of doors means you meet bajillions of cool people. I was the same way as you once; Primary Maintenance Staff, Call Center Employee, Programmer, Musician, Test Subject, Cashier, Farmhand, Self-employed Survey Taker, and Maid (I'm still a fair shot away from age 30). Some I noped out of immediately, others took me a few months/years to try.\n\nMy work/life balance is good (though sometimes I spend wayyy too much time on reports when I'm feeling motivated), though a bit seperated since I don't really have coworkers per se. It's probably not for everyone but I hope it helps!
3	Psychotherapist. Love it except the paperwork. I get to talk all day long about feelings with people.
3	Chef! Currently hopping around the restaurant group filling in gaps where our other exec/sous have vacay/maternity/quit. It keeps me busy and a creative outlet, and get to meet new people and eat new things!\n
3	I know this isn‚Äôt really what you asked but I‚Äôm in school studying to be a lawyer! Kinda worried that it doesn‚Äôt really fit my ENFP personality tho ahahaha
2	I work in IT, my job title is a little up in the air, but I primarily focus on technical support, sales and making sure my clients are happy.  I do enjoy the job, the IT portion of it is not my favourite part though, I‚Äôd say the people I get to work with make my day a lot of fun.  The job allows me to work from our office downtown, from home, from a random coffee shop or from the clients office.  Most things I do in the day can be done remotely.  I really value the ability to move around and change up my environment during the workday, if it wasn‚Äôt for that I probably wouldn‚Äôt be doing this job. \nAs for the work/life balance, I have been known to take my work home with me a lot (doesn‚Äôt help that I work from home), I like to ride my motivation waves when I get them, even if that means working 10+ hours in a day.  I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs an extremely healthy work/life balance.  
2	hi! i'm an interior stylist for a furniture company. kind of fell into the job, i'm definitely not the perfect person for it. but i love it! i have a hard time focussing on one thing, have way too many interests/hobbies, but i've had this job for almost 3 years!\n\ni know what you mean about the wrong career thing. i studied k-12 art education in school, taught for one year and never went back. i def have my days with the current job where i feel like making a change though. i think there's no way around that entirely though?\n\nfor me i think, the balance for this job has been in terms of self-pacing.  last year it got out of hand and i was working 60-80 hour work weeks, plus lots of travel for like 8 months straight. just had to be honest with myself and my boss to tone it back to a sustainable level.\n\nbeen having enough time to get back to my free time hobbies lately! i'm building a motorcycle for a friend, and a few miscellaneous woodworking projects.
2	I honestly love learning code, I do not know how much I will like it when I am actually trying to develop things, but I am feeling fulfilled every day I study. I love how it is all about connecting the dots and playing with possibilities. \n\nright now I am doing customer service/tech support for a software company. I still enjoy it, I would prefer to get off the phone though.  
2	I'm a dentist :) new grad and trying to find my place in this industry right now 
2	Occupational therapy grad student! 
2	Registered nurse! I work on a neuro floor 
2	I'm a taxidermist and leather worker! I love it! I used to work in an office and it drained my soul. 
1	Auto body technician. \n\nI like working with my hands. I like the visual satisfaction of a job well done. I like that there is a clear starting point & ending point for every job. I like the laid back atmosphere of the shop. 
1	Just started my first job as an Assistant Producer . I love it! learning new things everyday. new techniques to edit, sourcing for footages, coming up with new ideas for promos/commercials and being really creative. The people in the broadcast industry are chill af too so it works really well for me :) 
1	Sociology degree, but I work as a software engineer. I also was a school teacher for a while.\n\nLike many others here, I changed several jobs and hats, because I too get bored pretty quickly. In the last 15 years, my longest job position lasted 18 months, still wondering if I‚Äôll ever go beyond that duration ;-)
1	I work as a freelance Sound Designer! Am I happy with it? Mmmnnbghhdhhh kinda! The job per se is very cool and I love coming up with different ways to approach different jobs and situations with creativity, but in the country where I live it's like it isn't considered as a real job.\nPeople and firms and videogame companies think it's useless since they can do it downloading shitty samples from internet, so I have to work remotely with foreign countries!\n\nAs you said, I have too many interests as well. I love photography, video editing, writing and so on. So I keep my doors open and as a freelance worker I can propose myself in different suits! Freelancing could be very tough sometimes, but at least it can offer this freedom.
5	ENFP GIRL NEED help feeling dumb!	hey, guys how do you deal with the feeling of being dumb at work.  Like at my job most people know everything and my boss is used to telling us what to do but not how to, I google a lot but many times do it does not come out right.Idk what to do really any tips on how to deal with these feelings.
3	Learn how to express yourself üòä There‚Äôs usually a logical explanation for why you feel so strong for certain things, you just need to find it. I take notes after discussions reminding myself what to read up on or what things I need to figure out a way of saying, and get back to people afterwards.\n\nAlso I try to learn what ‚Äútraps‚Äù to avoid;\nNot admitting when you‚Äôre wrong\nTrying to persuade thinkers with feely arguments\nFeeling so confident in own opinions that one doesn‚Äôt really consider the opposing party\nEtc\n\nENFPs also seem to have a tendency to Think Extravertly in intense periods of time, exposing your ‚Äúunfinished‚Äù thoughts to everyone. The downside of this is that certain people will think you talk too much, and also making you vulnerable for anyone to judge.\n\nBut you‚Äôre a people person, you‚Äôll get better at picking up on people‚Äôs signals every day üòè\n\nGood luck üòä\n
3	Well for one take care of how you present yourself. Perception = reality. I mean even here, just reread what you wrote and how it sounds.\n\nI‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre dumb, but taking the time to slow down and properly express yourself goes a long way. \n\nWhen presenting an issue to someone you also need to be more specific with the assessment and outcome. ‚ÄúI google but it does not come out right idk what to do with these feelings...‚Äù doesn‚Äôt really tell your audience you‚Äôve applied any sort of real remedies...
1	Omg what I just posted this without having seen your post 
1	Ask for help. Approach your boss and let them know you‚Äôre really struggling. They should be open to helping you!
1	I think you need to be more specific here. Is this a job that you're completely new at...did you just get out of school and are new to the skill-set...or are you struggling for another reason(s)? \n\nBased on the info you gave, I would try to research as much as I can, do the job to the best of my ability, and run it by the boss or a trusted co-worker and ask them how I can improve, and take notes! Pay attention to what they're telling you, then fine-tune the next thing you do. 
15	A piece of advice that helps me all the time: if you don‚Äôt do it you won‚Äôt do it	Something I figured out about my personality type a long time ago, is that I have a ton of like good ideas, but struggle with follow-through. Textbook ENFP. My future self is an untrustworthy guy, but he‚Äôll still be just as disappointed that it didnt happen. Besides, I believe in life the only how are you have is in the moment. You have no control over the future or the past.\n\nThe only way for me to make these ideas come to fruition is to ride that initial wave of inspiration. Build momentum for yourself! make it happen!
2	I have this same problem! I get bursts of motivation that overcome me and I make grand plans and commit to crazy things etc. For me, i‚Äôm trying to get my life into a routine where I am on top of work/ setting aside specific time that is dedicated to being productive. Once it‚Äôs a routine, it feels more natural and I‚Äôm at a pace where Im consistently do a medium amount of work really well but also not over extending myself and relying on a burnt out, less interested, and unmotivated future - me lol. 
1	It might help too to find someone opposite, someone who is all can do and getting stuff done so you can work together.
16	By Oriah Mountain Dreamer	It doesn‚Äôt interest me what you do for a living. I want to know what you ache for ‚Äì and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart‚Äôs longing. It doesn‚Äôt interest me how old you are. I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool ‚Äì for love ‚Äì for your dreams ‚Äì for the adventure of being alive.
2	This is and will always be my mantra
2	Yes....YES!
4	Any fellow ENFPs want to start an Overwatch group?	Hey everyone! I'm looking for some ways to be social and make new friends! My job is one of those jobs where I get a random schedule every week, so its really hard to find consistent social stuff to do and sometimes I go weeks at a time without hanging out with anyone which is ultra mega unfun\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I'd love to start up an Overwatch group and meet some new people to hang with maybe a couple times a week! I have it for the xbox one. If you're interested send a pm! (make sure to include your favorite emojis!!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank for reading! I hope you all have a wonderful day and receive your daily requirement of dog cuddles!

3	DAE feel their ears ringing after everyone else has left and you're alone?	Sometimes after I've been with friends or a group of people, once I'm suddenly alone my ears will ring almost as if I've just walked out of a busy environment into a silent one and the contrast is really obvious.\n\nObviously this happens to everyone who, for example, walks out of a super busy, loud room full of people. But for me it can happen if I'm with just 2 or 3 (sometimes even 1) people having a normal conversation. They leave, and I feel like I've been shouting and talking frantically for ages (which maybe I have, who really knows) and I feel exhausted physically and mentally.\n\nJust me? I crave social interaction but I'm often left reeling by my own input.
1	That's interesting! I think I know what you mean but I haven't ever really paid attention to it. \nI surely know what you mean when you say you feel exhausted after those encounters! \nAbout the ringing: do you find yourself grinding your teeth or clenching the jaw during the day or night?\nIt stresses your inner ear and causes it to be more delicate and susceptible to sounds, even when you are talking!
1	Hi! I'm an audiologist. What you're describing is called tinnitus. Tinnitus can come and go, and is typically most noticeable in quiet places, but it can also be noticeable in loud places too. It's not just you who notices a spike in the ringing when things settle down, this happens to MANY of my patients that I see on a day to day basis, if it makes you feel any better. \n\nBasically the brain has nothing else to focus on in a quiet environment (in this case, a room with 3 people talking turns into a room with no one in it), hears that ringing, and hones in on it. It seems like you were concerned because it can happen to you even if you're only talking to one person, and then they leave. Again, this is an example of the brain having nothing else to focus on except for the tinnitus. There are also lots of other things that can cause it to be more perceptible: stress, loud concerts/noise, salt, caffeine, alcohol, the list goes on and on. \n\nIf the ringing ever bothers you, try putting some music (WITHOUT lyrics!!! this is important) or rain/nature sounds on in the background. The key here is "in the background". You want the music/sounds to be something that is low in volume, that you could almost forget that it is there. You don't want it to be so loud that it covers up the ringing, just so that it mixes in with it and is low-level. \n\nAny questions, feel free to PM me :)
9	Have a Wonderful Wednesday y‚Äôall, let those positive, enthusiastic, caring vibes roll	
3	Hey, you are amazing. Keep it up!

37	Micheal Scott, the king of all Enfps and our lord and savior amen
15	So true, yesterday was crying for like an hour missing some things & people, really sad, etc. then 2 hours later I'm like "WOOHOOO THE SKY WITH THE CLOUDS LOOKS RED AND MY FRIEND IS HERE LET'S PLAY PING PONG AND POOL AND OH HI *TRIPS OVER* I MEANT TO DO THAT HAHAHAH." \n\nEdit: emotions are awesome!!! 
9	My grandma texts me good morning every week day and tells me to have a marvelous Monday, terrific Tuesday, etc. it‚Äôs the cutest. I responded today. Good morning. Today is already terrific! I hope it is for you too! üíï‚ò∫Ô∏è
3	I‚Äôve been avoiding all emotions as of late, and I feel like it‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôm not as chipper as usual. I‚Äôve been stuck in the plume of despair, and I‚Äôm avoiding getting out of it. Usually, I‚Äôll over express on social media, drink wine, and cry my eyes out and then I‚Äôll be good. Anyone else? 
2	I had an unexpected meaningful conversation for an hour with someone I hadn't spoken to in years last night. When I woke up this morning I was STILL on that residual high. I felt amazing.
9	<3	Love you guys. It is my mission to abduct one of you  next, that way we can date. A little forward you say? Nahhh. \n\nI'll go back to my hole now. Bye bye. üëã

3	Most ENFP's keep their emotions hidden and under control.
3	2nd one has the best picture ever, i laughed and said to my spouse that can we clean like this :D\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut yeah, i can relate every one of them,some more than others but still.\n\n&#x200B;
3	I don't mind being told what to do if the one telling me what to do knows what they are talking about and can prove it. \n\nAlso, I'm not emotional, YOU'RE EMOTIONAL!
2	The 3rd one is utter rubbish. Poor practical skills?! That‚Äôs to do with upbringing, not nature.
6	Would you ever describe yourself as a "Creature of passion and love"?	Just curious... I feel like it describes me well...but it also feels a bit vain I guess.
5	>I love you \n\n>^(Horsey17 to Me from another thread)\n\nSo I guess I am not good enough to get your passion ... I see ¬¨_¬¨ \n\n
3	Fuck love...it to painfull if its unrequited...wish it to go away
1	I try to find something to love and be passionate about in everyone and everything. It's not always easy, but I feel like I'm better at it than most.
3	Weekly Support Thread	\n/r/ENFP has always been and will always be a place that lends an ear. Large or small, get it all off your chest. In this corner of the internet, you will be heard. We are here to support one another. We are all we have.\n\nThis doesn't replace the individual posts; it's just another avenue to start talking, MBTI related or not. Sometimes you need to check in more than once before you feel restored. That's what we're here for.\n
1	The INFJ subreddit has so many restrictions compared to the ENFP community. 
6	Musical Tastes?	I personally like all kinds of music, not specific genres. What matters to me in a song is not what kind of music it is but how it makes me *feel*. That make sense? I don‚Äôt know. But I‚Äôm interested in if all or most ENFPs are the same way, and if you aren‚Äôt then what are you into? \n\nEdit: although I think one song all ENFPs can agree on as perfect is Mr. Blue Sky by ELO 
4	I'm into just about any genre of music, except country and rap (I don't hate rap, I just don't like it when they a) cuss and talk about nothing but trash, which most rap does b) mumbles). \n\nThe genres of music I'm particularly fond of tho are Christian, EDM, classical, lofi hiphop/jazz and alternative rock. \n\nJon Bellion is one of my favorite musicians because of his diversity and creativity. Same thing with LAXX (EDM). He is incredibly unique in his style (particularly from his 'step' series)
5	Yeah, definitely all about the feels... and the lyrics, which have a big part in how a song makes me feel. A week or two back I listed my eclectic music preferences, but some of my favorite bands include Colony House, A Great Big World, AJR, Owl City, David Archuleta, and the Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square. 
2	I'm a huge metalhead, but Im also a huge fan of anything that sounds remotely celticy/folky and so naturally one of my favorite metal sub-genres is folk metal. Gorgeous melodies with flutes, violins, hurdy gurdys, accordions, etc... With complex intense guitar work and choruses to sing along with, it's a dream come true. \n\nI don't really care about lyrics. I look for either complex Instrumentation or emotional impact. Usually I prefer both. I have a thing for movie scores and video games soundtracks too. I dabble a bit here and there into classical music.\n\nMost music I enjoy gets me to cry. Which is hilarious for other people when they see a grown man with a huge beard have a tear leak down his face while listening to insanely harsh and intense music. 
1	Lil Peep, and only him. It began a year ago. Also listening to some Metal.\n\nI also listened to a lot of XXXTENTACION before, especially 17. \n\nBefore that, I was all out for EDM, especially Trap, Future House and "Dubstep". I really loved songs with outstanding sound design with a lot of uniqueness. (People on OWSLA) 
1	I listen to rap and pop. Vince Staples, Brockhampton, Earl Sweatshirt, Carly Rae Jepson, Left at London, Danny Brown, Kendrick Lamar, Bo Burnham, Jakey, Jpegmafia, JID, Injury Reserve,Tyler the Creator, Queen, Tessa Violet, Conan Gray, Denzel Curry, City Morgue, Lil Wayne, Rex Orange County Janelle Monae, Frank Ocean, Kali Uchis, Eminem, and Kanye West.\n\n\nSorry you had to read that
1	Same with me. I don't care if i don't like the singer but if the song makes me feel good I'll listen to it. Why limit yourself from things that you can enjoy.
1	oh it‚Äôs ALL about the feels for me. lyrics, to me, are always the afterthought. while i have a favorite genre, i‚Äôm not opposed to listening to others. and there are a few i don‚Äôt like but that‚Äôs because i don‚Äôt like the feelings they give me.\n\nmy current fave genre is edm, particularly anything from monstercat records. i usually enjoy the upbeat, sweet, almost anime-magical-girl-like stuff. but i also enjoy pop, prog rock, jazz, folk, some r&b, celtic, and some blues. it really comes down to what feelings they give me.\n\ni hate heavy metal and country, mostly. the former makes me feel SO SO anxious and the latter makes me feel... idk... greasy? i usually avoid rap since it just sounds like noise to me, but there are a few artists i enjoy like childish gambino and the occasional eminem song.
2	AI - virtual companion/dog	I can't watch it stretch out over the fields\n\nI can't see it's energy, it's love to run, its playful way of exploring \n\nI can't feel it. can't feel it's warmth, it's fur\n\nI can't see it looking up at me with anticipation\n\nBut I can feel that it's always there. It's always there waiting, always ready to listen. No matter what hour no matter what need I have, it will meet me and in its virtual way look up at me.
1	Is this about a Tamagotchi?
25	Depression Affecting ENFP Brain	Anyone else not feel like an ENFP when their depression hits?\n\nEver since November came, I haven‚Äôt felt like my ENFP brain is working the same way. I feel sharper, colder, not full of bounce and rainbows shooting out my ass. I‚Äôm more analytical.\n\nMy best friend who I don‚Äôt see in person often said I‚Äôm showing ENTJ tendencies. My T is coming out because my brain is so cloudy that it‚Äôs hard for my F to give a shit and I‚Äôve been exercising my J as a control factor to aid my mental health.\n\nI know I‚Äôm still an ENFP inside and I know we shift based on the environment/situation we‚Äôre in. I‚Äôm just scared and miss how my brain processes usually are/used to be. I‚Äôm probably just an unhealthy ENFP right now...\n\nEdit: Sorry if I miscommunicated, I didn‚Äôt mean for it to sound like my J comes out when I‚Äôm depressed. I don‚Äôt have the energy to give a shit about stuff and my P definitely comes in, but I have to force out my J to try to fight the depression. I force myself to exercise it when I desperately want to just stay in bed instead.
17	yeah man, that is called the Ne Te loop, skipping Fi as much as possible. It sucks because feeling trapped emotions from Fi is a pain in the ass but necessary to heal, to receive value for self. \n\nthe ENFP survival Guide by Heidi Preibe is what helped me, it gave me clarity that helped get out of that loop.
11	Yup! And few things are less productive than just lying in bed getting your brain caught in a loop of negative thinking and analysing. I've had a tough year and a whooole lot of it has got to do with putting energy in the wrong people. I can't change what happened, but I can change how I act now. My negative spirals really begin to affect my work life - and I honestly can't afford that. Here's a few things I'm trying to get past it:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\- Distance yourself from any sources of negativity in your life. In my case, that means distance from a certain ex, and some other negative friends. It may seem harsh and I'm not saying "cut them out completely", but even if just for a few weeks, it works miracles!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\- Keep up to date on your correspondence, even if that's just a few e-mails a day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\- Excercise! I get most of my excercise from dancing, but also have a gym membership nowadays, and hope to get a decent routine in order. Ideally, I want to head over to the gym for half an hour after breakfast, then go home. The ENFP lifestyle doesn't allow for this stability as I'm doing it now - I have late night plans almost every night (especially with the dancing), and meet up with friends in the morning fairly often. But maybe for us the trick lies in adjusting our routine accordingly? Whether I'm up and ready at 9 or am only free in the afternoon, to just head to the gym whenever it's right. Every day is different and that's beautiful in its own way. :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\- Clean up! Order some new makeup, try some new clothes, throw out all kinds of old things you don't use anymore. A thorough cleaning of a room can seriously work miracles, and even in your darkest mood, I find it not entirely impossible to just sit at a drawer, clear it out, dust it and rearrange everything. It's okay if it takes a while to do. You'll have accomplished something for the day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\- For every nasty, super ENTJ-like thought you have, don't dismiss it entirely. Accept it, breathe in, and then add a positive note to it. For example, suppose you're having some bad/rude thoughts about a friend - maybe you think they look weird in their outfit, or are overthinking a thing they have said. Really try to find a positive note to add to it as well: she's got a great smile, she was so sweet to me with the holidays, etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe truly can find the good in everything. And yes, sometimes that bites us in the behind. But we should never consider it a "negative" trait - it's what can get us through anything and everything, even a nasty bout of depression, like the sun shining through the rain!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
6	i can relate to you. in the last few weeks i had pretty intense time at school and i feel like i got overly competitive, analytical and cold. i almost feel as if i lost the positive outlook on life that i always had and turned into an angry hermit. i miss my bubbly self!! i hope i can get through this but i dont really know how.
3	It‚Äôs very well possible that your personality is changing because of depression or depression symptoms, but one of the biggest fears of an ENFP is losing touch with yourself, so it‚Äôs common for you to become paranoid about your behavioral shifts and whether you really are who you are or not, so try to do your best to not overthink it!
3	rainbow wouldn't be a rainbow without the rain
3	If it's truly depression, MBTI becomes irrelevant (loops and such stuff are nonsense, hail Heidi Priebe, lol). Your "T" is not coming out because your brain is cloudy. You're probably feeling more "thinker-like" because depression usually comes with apathy and anhedonia. \n\nAlso I find it hard to believe that you're J-like. Most people that suffer from depression report just the opposite -- their conscientiousness decreases.
2	Like others have mentioned, read "THE ENFP Survival Guide." I too have fell into some loops, entered my "shadow self," etc. and the ENFP survival guide will help you understand the cognitive functions better. 
2	Thank you for sharing this, I‚Äôm in a similar spot, I have been agonizing over the perceived loss of my ‚Äúspunky‚Äù self, and it‚Äôs been helpful to read the comments and hear that I‚Äôm not alone in this. Hope you start feeling better soon, friend!
2	No... just no. I've been fighting depression for an entire year, and there is nothing TJ about it. My apartment is a fucking wreck, I have a hard time feeling like I give shit about anything, and I just want to drink. I've been trying to cut alcohol out of my life to help this shit, but I've experienced nothing of what you mean.
5	How do you guys deal with/get over crushes you get while in a relationship?	I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs pretty common among us ENFPs to have ‚Äúgreener pastures‚Äù tendencies and get crushes a lot in general, so I thought I‚Äôd ask y‚Äôall for some input :)\n\n
1	This is something I had difficulty recently with. I got involved with someone introverted who I thought I jibed well with but red flags continued to pop-up. Meanwhile, I continued to have a crush on a coworker (all three of us work together) and found myself thinking about the crush more than the relationship.\n\nI recognied how insanely awful this was and broke it off, as I wouldn't want someone with me thinking about "greener pastures" as you described. \n\nIt's definitely gotten me back on the track of feeling like I don't deserve to be in a relationship with either of them.\n\nThe best way I've found to get over a crush is to cut off communication completely, which isn't healthy for most situations. Nothing like time and distance to see a feeling for what it is. \n\nOtherwise, even while I recognize that this too shall pass, I can't stop thinking about this girl. Sorry to not have more useful advice.
79	DAE replay a song from the beginning because you feel like you were distracted while listening or that you need to appreciate the song more?	
12	Yes. 100%. Most songs actually...sometimes I'll replay the same song 6 times for that one part.
7	This is me with tv. I prefer watching alone because I'm always, like, "wait. What book was that?" or "What was the look on their face when they said that?"
3	"*Why dont we reeeee-w*"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI dont think I heard that *'re'* properly\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*'U know i want u..."*
3	YES
2	Exactly. 
2	Mhm and even if what you live is the breakdown you still want to analize how the song progressed into that, also if you play any instrument you kinda want to figure out how they play it
2	Haha yes absolutely 
1	YEAH. It happens when reading a book as well! I occasionally want to read again the same sentence for that reason!
15	Some memes from the sub INFP sub I relate to üôÉ	
2	Lol this hits a little too close to home with me
4	Journaling	Hello, fellow ENFPs!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was wondering if and how often everyone journals? :)
3	I used to do it in high school, daily. Then stopped. I started journaling now after a heartbreak...\n\nIt helps a lot to get my thoughts and feelings out. 
2	Heyyy! Sure, I try to do it as regularly as I can but, like a lot of other things I try to keep going, sometimes I just forget I have it as a tool or I feel uncomfortable doing it.\n\nMaybe because of strong feelings that I have to write down? Could be. Yeah. Totally :D\nAnd when I find the strength or the will to write something down it's a HUGE relief!\n\nWhat about you?
2	As often as I can, usually every other day. 
62	Do you ever just get pissed over being told what to do?	The older I get, the worse it gets. I WILL question every damn thing until I see there‚Äôs a good reason for it. People are just testing my patience like crazy.. \n\nedit: Even after the wave of anger passes, I think ‚Äúwhy couldn‚Äôt they just talk to me instead of demanding?‚Äù and yes, i‚Äôm that kid in class that doesn‚Äôt just ask for the theorem but rather ‚Äúwhy/how do we do this?‚Äù lol
14	Right?? Why is it so hard to give a reason? 
10	being told what to do when I already want to do it is a surefire way for me to NOT do it
9	I've been opperating on this premise for years:\nYou can tell me when to do it, you can tell me how to do it, but never tell me when and how to do it.
6	First words out of my mouth ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù  \nJk. I don‚Äôt question if it‚Äôs reasonable
11	So pissed Mae!! It‚Äôs not that I always think I‚Äôm right either, I just have a problem with authority I guess. #ENFProblems üòÇüíï
6	I try not to anymore. I use Malicious Compliance if something is said that totally stupid.   
5	Constantly. All the time. Holy shit.\n\nI‚Äôve become somewhat used to ‚Äútaking orders‚Äù for my work, but when the orders are poorly thought out, lazy, incorrect, or coming from an asshole... I verge on quitting almost every time.
5	before I get pissed, I stop for a while and Im thinking if the thing someone is telling me to do has a sense or not and then I decide if I will do it or not
3	Sometimes I love to please authority figures but once I start hating my job, I HATE my superiors.
3	It pisses me off more than anything on Earth!! That and being told *how* to do something. I can't do things the way you do them! I can only do it my way, because I'm me, and this is my interpretation!!\n\nMy friends won't even tell me to "drive safe" when I leave somewhere, but instead "drive however you like!"
3	Every day of my life. It's called Internal Feeling. We want every action to align with our values otherwise it's not worth doing.
2	Yes, and it does get worse with age. But I actually get pissed more from being told what to do coming from family and friends, rather than work.\n\nWorkwise I‚Äôm fine being told what to do, as I‚Äôm not much of a planner, although I do like to do it my way, once I have the task. So no micromanagement for me.
2	Yes, I need a *reason* to do anything. I absolutely hate being told what to do. I hate meetings. I hate time commitments unless there's a big reason, something in it for me, or some clear value we're providing to other people that I'm needed for. \n\nIn fact I work independently as a freelance digital marketer, so that I can pick my clients, pick my hours, and live anywhere in the world. \n\nI can manage if someone tells me what to do in the rare instance, but overall I prefer to do things myself OR like we all said have a clear, valuable reason for doing something a certain way. 
2	oh yea exactly, I mean I am happy to be PERSUADED  with your fair points and theories . but if you goddamn demand me or gimme orders without PROPER reasons , no, I will not buy it. 
2	For the most part I am pretty good at obeying but it does get irritating. I don't like super strict rules but if I find reason and purpose in it I can follow it. But yea being told what to do regardless still irritates me I need my freedom of choice. 
1	all the time. especially by myself
1	It is your inferior Si. It  rebels against tradition and being controlled. That is the ultimate ENFP fear/anger. But as you get older you can learn to better deal with it.
18	I just got fired on my first day at work. Can I please get hugs.	
6	I'm so sorry to hear op.. I would've give you a biiiig hug and bring over some wine and donuts if I was there to make you feel better. Please don't take this experience as a way to beat yourself up, but use this as a stepping tool to your future endeavours! If it's any consolations I had a similar experience not so long ago, the company I worked with for a  long time decided to downsized and they had to let me go because they could not afford me. I was devastated. I crawled under my work desk and just bawled my eyes out. Use the strong Ne in me to keep looking forward and now I'm working in a place that I really love and passionate about. Would not have it any other way. Stay strong! <3
7	Well, if you got fired on the first day, at least you weren't able to build up a false sense of mentor-mentee-ship at a company that doesn't care about you *cries in dejected ness
6	Hugs what happened  ? Bullies?
3	\*internet hug
2	I'm sending you a giant hug. Maybe it's not so bad? \n\nI was once working at a bank. A coworker stole $ through my PC, she tricked me. She had reversed fees on her account & told me she was double checking something. \n\nThe cameras clearly revealed that I had no affiliation, and no idea what she was doing. I was not trained on the parts she was working on. She was my "superior" and being helped by her, so naturally I yielded to when she said she needed to check something real quick. \n\nMy manager & other co-workers didn't want to let me go. The board? haha, they wanted me fired. \n\nSo I was fired, and as I drove home in rage for how fucking stupid the corporate world is, I promised myself I'd never work a real job again. \n\nI should also add I graduated the training top of class, and was performing exceptionally at my job. The fact that they fired me was beyond ridiculous. My manager encouraged me to get another bank job & place him as a reference so he can help me out. \n\nNope, wasn't happening. I was done with jobs, forever. \n\nSince then, I've started my online business (which I was already doing before). I traveled to 12 countries, fell in love on the other side of the world (and got heartbroken, nooo), crashed a motorcycle in Thailand (adventure??), and so much more. I've worked as little as 4 hours in one week so I could take care of myself. I've healed my chronic pains. I've created a life I never could've imagined. \n\nSo let me tell you now dear friend that the Universe, God, or life itself is here to HELP YOU, but it just has strange ways of doing it. \n\nPerhaps this is the greatest blessing ever? Your next job will be your dream job? If my situation (with many other details left out) turned out for better, I promise to you that yours can as well. \n\nI believe in you, and you're ENFP so anything is possible if you put your mind to it!!! \n\nGood luck, big hugs, you're awesome, cry it out, then celebrate for now you are free and all of the opportunity of the world sits at your fingertips... what do you want? It is yours, you must simply claim it. :) \n\nEdit: sounds like a fucked up workplace. This WAS a blessing. Find a better employer that respects & values you. :) 
2	Oh, u/jellygator0 , just know that this was one of those universal moments where leaving earlier was better (and earliest best!) Their actions speak more about them than they do about you and that small minded workplace isn't a good fit! When one door closes.... \n\n\n\nYou are talented, capable, and important. \n\n*Lots of hugs*\n\n\nPM if you want to talk.
87	Do any of you feel as though you have an ‚Äòaddictive personality‚Äô or are quite impulsive? And if so to what? Like food, people, etc?	
55	Depends on the phase of my life. As a teenager, I was addicted to video games. I was depressed for a while and came close to killing myself (I could say this was another addiction). Then I got addicted to books. Next was watching tv shows. People came and went and I did get addicted to them too. After my breakup, it was with makeup and looking good lol. Now, for the first time in my life I am addicted to wanting to be successful and making my life worth living. So I guess I am progressing and using my ‚Äúaddiction‚Äù in a positive way.
22	Yes and if I feel like doing something in the moment, then I most likely end up doing it unless its really dumb. Though I've had unprotected sex on the first date a few times which would probably be in the really dumb category. I also have a habit of speeding but not when I'm in school zones/residential areas(though I can be pushing it for the latter) or if its just blatantly unsafe like there's a lot of ice. ALSO I've spent over 1k on this mobile game which is why I'm never going to step foot in a casino lol. I'm also never touching any addictive drugs because I'm afraid of being addicted. Already addicted to cigarettes and was pretty bad with weed in the past.
16	Vices and people
12	weed. fuck sakes.
6	I wouldn't say I have an addictive personality, though I do have a few addictions born out of heavy habit (reddit, TV, I'd say I'm addicted to depression at this point). Very impulsive, though. Suddenly I want cake, I won't stop until I have cake. I just saw something online that I didn't know until now I want, I'm ordering it right now. Usually it's records, clothing items, movies, or oddities.
7	YEP!!! \nI love getting high and for about 2 years I had a struggle with opiates. I'm pretty much just a talkative stoner now and I'll pop a pill or two if offered (no more scamming, stealing, or buying for me!) I am in recovery from Binge Eating Disorder and I've gone from bingeing 3-4 days a week to maybe once every few months. \n\nAnd I do have some impulse control issues (well, duh) and my credit rating has suffered in the past because of it, but I've been able to get that under control as well.\n\nAfter several years of therapy I've landed in a pretty good spot. I still have my problems, but they're all getting worked out and patched together. 
5	I definitely can let some of my crushes go much deeper than what's healthy, if that's considered an "addiction". I also change my life plan every few years, and can become obsessed with varying hobbies. \n
4	It's always been whirlwind relationships, and when those don't work out, sugar galore. Thankfully I've settled into a kind of modified Atkins diet and kept my mind off the sweets lately, but I'm still waiting for the hopeless romantic complex to kick the bucket :/
4	Yes, I‚Äôm a sensation seeker. Anything new and exciting is fair game for me, which caused me to experiment a lot with drugs and adrenaline inducing activities.
3	Sugar. It‚Äôs like I am in a trance when eating it.\nWeed. I like it to relax, but it has definitely become a habit. \nExercise, but more so classes where I feel I can compete against people. \nI am definitely an all or nothing kinda person! I can quit sugar and weed easy (and have for long periods) but then when I have a little taste again, it reignites the flame. Exercise I‚Äôm the same. Happy being a lazy fat shit, but get obsessed with new things easy. \n\nEdit: forgot the new thing! Intermittent fasting. Obsessed about the eating window. 
4	Oh definitely. Addicted to people, to mobile games, to Wattpad stories. The addiction to people is the worst though, rest is mostly controllable and and it doesn't affect anyone other than me. With people, I end up smothering and being overbearing. I over analyze everything they say or do - like it repeats in my mind like a video that I'm watching. I dream about the future with them and a lot more things. I'm trying to work on it because it really isn't healthy. Let's see how much I can overcome\n \nAlso, fear of getting addicted is the primary reason for why I never tried any drugs (not even weed). It was because of this that I tried alcohol at a much later age. Got addicted to it, but I thankfully, got over it and now it's under control. My test with alcohol gives me hope that I can fight back an addiction but I seriously don't want to test the limits. 
3	I have a lot of issues with impulse control. In the past it has taken me for many wild rides involving food, exercise, people, booze, weed, caffeine, romance, sex/masturbation, watching t.v. and more. I have become much better at controlling my impulses as I've gotten older by recognizing when I'm engaging in impulsive behaviour and accepting the fact that I am not capable of the same moderation others might be. Also that taking the initial step toward the behaviour is all that must be avoided in order to avoid the negative outcomes entirely. It can be especially difficult when avoidance of one behaviour drives me toward a different one. I still struggle with certain things but I have been sober from alcohol for just over a year now and that has reeeeeeeallllllly helped.
3	Everything. If I‚Äôm into someone or something, I‚Äôll generally act on a whim. If I‚Äôm not into someone or something, or I‚Äôve lost interest in them, I can‚Äôt be bothered at all. 
3	Addicted to love interests, sugar, coffee, masturbation, weed, and hopelessness.  Feels good to wean off any of them.  They are all not worth it, but they all feel pretty good.  Except hopelessness.  Hopelessness is just because the void of existence is like a stupid monkey on my back, so i'm "addicted" to it because I can't stop thinking of the lack of meaning.  
3	Yeah, I get addicted to literally anything. From food to habits to people to sex, drugs, whatever.\n\nI know it, and I catch myself before anything goes seriously wrong. This is the brain I have and I will figure out a way to carve a life worth living for myself *with* this brain.
3	I am Defs addicted to people. Took me removing myself from EVERYONE I've known or loved to finally see through the haze and that I never was living for myself. I'm not even sure I am now.
3	Books, sex and alcohol. I do my best to not become an alcoholic but I drink a lot. I realise that. 
3	I am super impulsive, especially if it is something that I think my wife or daughter will also enjoy.\n\nRecently, my wife mentioned that she would like a bigger nightstand type table next to her side on the couch, so while she was at her college class, I built her a small computer desk and placed it next to the arm of the couch.\n\nI also go through phases where I am super addicted to something, then drop it like an old hat and move onto something else. Like many other ENFPs, I am super involved with what I get inspired by, but halfway through I decide not to finish it.\n\nIt is also very hard for me to pick in a lot of decisive "A, B or C" moments. I end up seeing the good in each of them or how I can somehow relate to each of them and then I can't figure out which one I actually like better.\n\nMy wife is the only person/thing that I have definitively picked and stuck with. Haha.
3	Food definitely. Im not overweight but i definitely have a food/sugar addiction. Im working on it tho. I also have yearly obsessions that then go away but I learned to embrace it cause i still use my 'knowledge' and incorporated them in my lifestyle. Thanks to that i know makeup, feminism, veganism mbti... do others enfp have that ??
3	I have always had an addictive personality. No matter what it is, I always need more of it. Alcohol, drugs, food, petting my cat, you name it. Everything is addicting to me
2	I'm extremely impulsive. Sometimes I want to abuse drugs...like take my parents Vicodin or Xanax, but that was in worse times and I never had abused them. 
2	Not necessarily. Although I will say that I dont smoke weed for that reason. My ex got me into it and it started to become a thing of habit and I didnt like that. I could easily see myself being emotionally dependant on it. I know alot of people who are and they dont even realize it. The same goes for alcohol, but that usually makes me depressed anyways so why bother. 
2	Thinking about it, I have a hard time letting go of relationships. Like sometimes it almost doesnt matter what the other person did to me, I dont want to let them go. Of course by doing that I was able to find the love of my life, and I'm happy to say he loves me back. But yes, I do think I have an "addictive personality."
2	 Yes. But I blame most of that on my BPD and ADD. I get easily addicted/obsessed with certain (at times random) things, and I used to be very impulsive. Its something I have worked on getting better at. Now I‚Äôd rather just chill on my couch and not make last minute crazy plans or go out. Its just stressful man. If I do anything I try to plan it ahead, so that i dont fuck it up or get stressed out.\nThe chill life is a good life. 
2	Reading these comments is kinda scary. Please remember that addiction, impulsivity and reckless behaviour is not just a harmless personality trait, but a real problem. I see a lot of people here who needs real professional help (or would benefit from it). \n\nSeeing too many relatable things here that I struggled with before I got diagnosed with BPD and ADD, and got tons of help, therapy, and some ADD medication.\nTo me it was a sign of bad untreated mental illness, and it feels so good to have gotten help and gotten better.\n\nHope yall are gonna be okay. 
2	Codependency.  Yes ma‚Äôam.  
2	100%. I pushed off ever underage drinking until I was a few months away from the legal age. I self harmed growing up and I knew that I had an addictive personality so I took that into consideration. Even now, years later, I try to remember it.\n\nI also long boarded when I was younger and would go down hills impulsively. I‚Äôve used the internet as an escape ever since I can remember...
2	Dated ten guys before my current (much more stable) relationship. I also have an unhealthy relationship with Dr. Pepper, and sometimes scrolling mindlessly on Pinterest or Reddit.
2	Yeah a bit. It's been bad but also good in some ways, yin n' yang. 
2	Reading all of these was simultaneously worrisome and comforting. I have an addictive personality, definitely, and it's something I struggle with. Food and people are the top of my lists. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI recommend therapy and meditation to anyone who commented and to OP if you are struggling as well.
1	Booth!
1	I collect toys and impulse buy them a lot.\n\nNot like affecting my finances a ton, just I buy a lot of cheaper small ones and get sad because big nice ones come out and Ive used up my budget
1	Well yes but that is because I have an actual addiction, to porn. I have been trying to quit 10 years, have sought addiction counseling, etc. It ruined my life from middle school to now. Anxiety, social anxiety, depression, foggy memory, denationalization, even potentially hair loss, are all caused by porn addiction and been real problems for me. Not to mention physical issues involving sex because of my idiosyncratic masturbation style so that I have never been able to "finish" besides doing it myself.\n\nI also have never drank, smoked, or done drugs and don't plan to. I am already out of control, I don't want to add to that in any way.
1	Internet . lol\n\nI was totally depressed as a teen and kept watching youtube videos .. i have thousands of favourite videos -- now i'm getting a bit better. just addicted to diff things maybe? like reddit - maybe social interaciton would be a good alternative lmfao\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh and weed at parties too, it was hell trying to get over that with my social anxiety
11	Im dumb crazy for laughs	Ok so I posted about my relationship the other day. I'm ngl I wrote it kinda funny and people thought it was funny. Idk what it was yesterday but I was on a role. On Reddit, IRL, at school, and auto tech. Making people laugh, having really good timed jokes. I even finished the day working on my group project for my AP environmental science group project about Algae being a renewable resource, by replacing the lyrics of I'm Different by 2 Chainz with Algae related stuff.\n\nAnyways, those are the best days and I hope y'all have that day today!
3	INFP needs help with an ENFP friend	Hello, guys! I need your help desperately. I have a friend who I'm 99,9% sure is an ENFP. We have been friends for 3 years and a half now and I just love her a lot. However, she has always proposed plans she'd never talk about ever again. I was always the one who had to go to things she was already going to because when I invited her to do stuff she had said we should do she just ignored me. Last year, however, I took care of her cats many times when she was away and I had accepted I was a friend of convenience and I decided to focus on the cats I loved a lot while still being friendly. The last time I took care of them she told me to stay with her and we spent an amazing week together. The subject of changing plans came up occasionally and I confessed that it used to drive me crazy, but as I said before, I no longer expected a friendship like the one I hoped we'd have so I told her it didn't bother anymore. She mentioned she felt free that way and we talked about something else.\n\nAfter that week she invited me to go out with some of her friends, but then she never mentioned it again and I spent Christmas recess waiting for her invitation and did nothing. We eventually went out with them one day and as always, whenever I see her I forget I was mad because she's just so amazing, caring, nurturing... Then, she invited me to go out with another friend of hers who was visiting from another town. I was happy and made plans. As I was getting ready to move to a new house I was super busy, but as always, I made time for them because she's the person I feel better with in the entire world. We went out once, but she canceled on three other plans. I got mad and told her I wasn't going to the one she and her friend decided to go to. She apologized saying she wasn't feeling well and that her friend wanted to do something else. Normally I would totally understand, but she's been doing that basically since we have met. I sent her a ten minutes audio calmly explaining how it hurt me every time she said we were supposed to do something never to talk about it again or just cancel. I swear I tried to be as nice as possible, I wasn't even mad anymore when I sent it to her. My goal was to salvage our friendship because if that happened once more I wasn't sure I'd be able to keep being her friend. I felt that I didn't matter at all and that I couldn't rely on her. She said that me saying that didn't change the affection she felt towards me, that she needed time and that I shouldn't stop myself from doing other things just because she commented something. She also said she was very sad because of my audio and that she'd need time to process it all.\n\nI told her she could have all the time she needed and explained more emphatically than I should have that to me they were plans, not just comments. I mean, she had told me the dates in which her friends would go out, said we would have a great time together, that I'd go see her cats often... She never replied and I was feeling okay until I re-read her message. She mentioned that we probably had different concepts of what a plan was. I was already feeling horrible for making her feel sad and after that everything clicked. She does that because she feels free like that and I'm an INFP in a Fi-Si loop who's expecting bad things from the past to happen again and again. My father used to cancel on me to hurt me when we weren't getting on well and I guess I have projected that on our friendship. I guess I also have different expectations of what friendship is. I feel like I'm being used when the person is only there almost whenever it suits her. To her defense, she has done some amazing stuff for me that she didn't have to do, but I guess the loop I'm sure I'm in is clouding my judgment.\n\nI've been reading about ENFP for a couple of days and it definitely fits her perfectly. If Ne is her main function, she probably won't be more dependable and I shouldn't want her to change her dominant function either. If someone told me, an INFP, to feel less it would be totally pointless. I wouldn't listen and couldn't change even if I wanted. I do this thing of thinking about thousands of possibilities, but as Ne is my secondary function, I think more about them than act on them only to change my mind later. After thinking a lot about it I understand where she's coming from. I even remember that as a child people would get mad at me for changing my opinions often, but as time passed I became someone more prone to thinking too much before acting. Still, even if I understand her I'm not sure I won't feel she doesn't care about me if she does that again, which she definitely will if that's a trait of her personality. Do you guys think there's a way in which we could find a middle ground between considering plans virtually sacred and flaking? Or are unhealthy INFPxENFP relationships doomed? And if there's hope, how should I apologize for hurting her and not understanding her? Will she ever forgive me or will she just say she does but never truly get over it?
11	[deleted]
4	I am an ENFP and I have a friend (not an ENFP) who does this to me. For me it's frustrating because I feel like our friendship is really special (and she has claimed that she feels the same), but it's like she puts up barriers to stop our friendship from developing further. We have a weird history though. It's been pretty well established that we have both had feelings for each other, but she doesn't feel like we are right for each other... So that's where her barriers come from.\n\nI feel like that with other people though too, not just people I'm romantically interested in.... I just want a deep, abiding friendship and everyone just seems to want to settle for the average, superficial kind. That being said, I play favorites a lot. The I-want-a-deep-and-abiding-friendship-with-you people make up a pretty small pool. There is a larger group that I am sort of flaky about. Like, I am friendly and even enjoy their presence, but I will prioritize the small pool people over them. Usually I just avoid committing to large group people until I confirm that small-pool people are busy. Also, once I commit to large group people, I only flake out if I make sure they have an alternate person/plan in place to still have an enjoyable time.\n\nThis sounds kinda manipulative whenever I try to explain it, but I basically just me trying to be considerate of the feelings of others. I don't commit to something unless I plan on following through (or I'm up front about potentially flaking), and if I do flake, I make sure not to leave people high and dry.\n\nYour friend can definitely do more to consider your feelings... even if they are weird like me and have you sorted into a different pool than you'd prefer. 
3	Uh, I'm an ENFP. I think ENFPs and INFPs tend to like each other a lot, but they are too similar to ever get anything done or even maintain a relationship outside of a family or work situation. Both ENFPs and INFPs rely on others to make them feel loved/safe and to decide what to do and the best way to do it.  Why, then, would anyone want an ENFP for a friend? They can be very funny, warm, and generous they are very open to what others want and think. However, sometimes people can read more into this than what's really intended. Also, I personally suck at maintaining social ties or organizing social events. I really depend on my spouse for this. You might want to try to find a type that has NI and TI  will want to initiate, organize and follow through on plans. She may also know that she is not detail oriented enough to pull off a plan. That's the way I am, and it was much worse when I was younger. That's my two cents. 
0	She feels choked and there has always been too much pressure from you. You cannot feel safe and happy without her. You have dieocnnected from yourself. So how can you wonder why she doesnt want to be with you when you dont want to be with yourself? The day that you become indipendent to and free from her and all of your other past present and future friends. That is the day you will become attractive not only to her but to anyone you want. \n\nRealize that you probably dont know her very well. And that the people in our life are mirrors to us. Youve lost yourself and immersed yourself in the reflection. But youre not the reflection. Find yourself. Meditate on the thought, "what side of myself is this person showing me?"
3	Who relates?	I constantly find myself wanting to be the hero, wanting to stand up and fight for what's right. A lot of its physical anger, a lot of its mental anger. But the calm side of my personality restrains the anger, letting it slowly boil up inside, waiting to burst. Why do I am I like this? Nothing in my past has put me in this position, I just simply want to see justice served when it needs to be served. I want to be the one who helps make this world a better place. My heart longs to see people safe and happy, bellies full, and healthy. I cant stand seeing the world the way it is, but I have no idea where to start or what to do to change that.
3	Yes. I feel insecure because i work in social justice but I come from such a privileged background. It just makes me disgusted to think about other people suffering or for other people to be taken advantage of.
2	Uhg, I always wanted to be an Antihero of sorts. I used to joke about wanting to be the villain with friends, but they said I couldn't fool them. Now, as I grew up I try to look at my career in some fashion of helping the world be a little better, even if it isn't enough...I have to remind myself that I am contributing to betterment of something good.
2	What career path should I take?	I'm a recently graduated ENFP who majored in Economics. Even though it's a solid major, I really have not been able to find anything in this field. I worked a few months in construction (all my coworkers like me, but I suck at it) and then had a short stint as Receptionist, which I got let go from. My confidence is at an all time low üòìüòî I'm just not sure where to go from here! I thought about getting certified as a teacher, or maybe learning computers so I can do digital design or something of that sort. I'm just super lost at this point 
1	Are you looking for a job or a career? Where are you looking? Do you know people with a similar background? What sort of things are they doing?\n\nIn a perfect world, what would you be doing?
2	What are your hobbies that embrace your playful, childlike extroverted intuition?	I am a mid twenties, female ENFP and I‚Äôve been working in the ‚Äúreal world,‚Äù in grad school, and basically ‚Äúgetting shit done‚Äù mode for a while now.\n\nI have realized my playful, child-like self is tucked away somewhere in the back of my consciousness, and I want to wake her up... society reinforces us to ‚Äúhide‚Äù this part of us in adulthood, so let‚Äôs hear what you all love to do in your free time that embraces your spark! 
3	for me is:\n\n\- playing with  dogs or children (I dont have any of these of my own yet but still)\n\n\- drawing\n\n\- playing cards with others etc
2	I think silly group games are really great for this like paper telephone, spoons.\n\n I love playing a game with my friends where we just say similar words back to each other. No one made it up but it's fun to say "Tater tot" "tater snot" "titter plop" until starts giggling. Tapping into this kind of creativity is so basic and silly. Last night I visited my friend at work and instead of giving me a hug he gave me a hand hug. And I was like how do we do a double hand hug? Then we did a whole bunch of variations. Silliness abounds.\n\nGroup dinners is a great way to tap into your silliness too. Have a glass of wine and sit around the table and tell stories. \n\nIf you have a pup or a child (or borrow one) I highly recommend taking them to a park or a beach and running around in circles. My old dog will still chase me down the beach from time to time. Take the opportunity to listen to some music and pick up sea glass or interesting leaves, depending on your location. \n\nPlay is all around you, good luck!
2	Playing electric guitar at a very high volume like a mad man 
1	Board games, sports, hiking, activities including water, cooking new food. Dancing, more than anything, dancing. I go swing dancing and it really just lights me up, laugh, smile etc.
1	That's when I allow creativity to flow freely. For me personally I paint or draw. It sorta refreshes me and allows me to express myself how I want to express myself. 
2	Hey guys, I was wondering if you guys could give me a little emotional support, I know I'm not alone in anything im going through and so any advice you have to offer would be greatly appreciated.	I'm feeling hugely overwhelmed atm with life in general. I know desperately who I want to be and whilst I know we can never reach our personal perceptions of perfection, I've always believed that we should focus on growth and development so we can get close it. I want to be the perfect student, friend, daughter, partner, I want to be balanced and live as efficiently and as ethically as possible. \n\nBut life is gross. Like I feel very trapped in my body, like I have to wake up everyday and it feels like groundhog Day. I have to wake up and cover my body in clothes that have been made by underpaid, enslaved kids oversees. All my electronics are causing some form of pollution, then I go and eat meat that I know animals are kept in horrible conditions and killed for. Then I'm aware of any amount of waste I create and how I'm just adding to all the wasted resources that get thrown away everyday whilst people are homeless, starving, can't afford correct medication, working jobs that they hate to survive, trapped in war torn countries, under governments that don't give a shit about them etc.\n\nAnd I'm trying so hard to be everything I want, like I try to cut down on things I feel guilty for, and I'm trying to balance my health, disabilities, and illnesses, with my law degree and being a good person. And I wish I was organised and had everything under control but I just feel like I'm in a whirlwind. And life just feels gross, like I desperately want to escape my body as if it's sticky. \n\nI'm so painfully aware of all the injustice and pain and suffering in the world. How much I take for granted and how all over the world people are going through so much worse. I feel so conflicted like I should be so happy and I feel like I have no excuses to be the person I want to be but everyday I seem to feel less and less productive and happy. I just wish I could almost go to sleep forever, and not have to deal with life because it honestly sucks, like I make all these jokes about how I'm going to change the world and help people and what not, and I know that it's impossible and that any change I do achieve is enough but it doesn't feel like enough. \n\nI get a lot of voices in my head that are like "well if you hate xyz so much you should just, ethically source your clothes, go vegan, volunteer, do all your work so you can help people oneday. But it's just so hard like I know I'm being a baby about it but I just so badly want to world to be a good place and everyday it feels like I'm haunted. \n\nLike I've had suicidal thoughts p much my whole life and I'm so much better than I used to be. I used to feel like life was completely pointless. Whereas now I believe that the purpose of life is to survive, to grow, and to give. But there's just soooooo much that needs doing, it's as if now there are too many points and I'm being stabbed by them repeatedly. 
2	I am aware of the amount of shit that is constantly going on the world. Yeah, it is good to try to help and do at least few choices which can improve the overall situation BUT:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can¬¥t possibly save everyone and you shouldn¬¥t feel quilty about it. You are not responsible of every evil in the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt would be better for you mentally to just focus on some points you want to make better and keep going on with that, than constantly overload yourself with all injustice happening in the world. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd i know it sounds selfish, but your life is livable to you only, so take care of yourself and do things that make you happy, instead of just fulfilling obligations (because if you do only obligations, you end up feeling worthless almost all the time). Also there is NOTHING wrong to think about yourself for time to time, it is probably healthy. We are allowed to feel and be selfish from time to time.\n\nI hope this helps,though it might sound horrible and harsh. Felt kinda similar feelings towards different things and sometimes still do.\n\n\*Hugs\*
1	Also a lawyer - what‚Äôs your practice area? Are you practicing in an area you‚Äôre passionate about? Do you feel like your job contributes to your feeling of helplessness re: injustices?\n\nI know I‚Äôm asking the almost impossible, but try and turn off lawyer brain when you‚Äôre reflecting on ‚Äúwhere you are‚Äù v. ‚Äúwhere you want to be‚Äù. Your life is not a hypo to IRAC; stop focusing on the having not reached destination and start taking some time to applaud yourself for being on the journey.\n\nThis is easier said than done (because lawyer), but cut yourself some slack. Rome wasn‚Äôt built in a day. It takes time for change or impact to rise to the level of greatness you‚Äôre shooting for,  my girl RBG didn‚Äôt become a boss lady/famous woman‚Äôs rights advocate overnight - it takes time.\n\nI have been feeling very disenchanted (professionally) for quite sometime, and I subconsciously allowed that toxicity to bleed into my personal life. Do not do what I did.  \n\nYou can‚Äôt be the change you wish to see in the world if you‚Äôre not taking care of yourself. Practice emotional hygiene and be kind to yourself. You can do this girl, hang in there.
1	ISTJs: why are they my sed fate?	All my 3 exes are ISTJ. My current companion is also ISTJ. My father and brother are ISTJ ._. At this point of life I basically know how to deal with them in an automatic way when it comes to information process and expression etc lol
3	It is because you're looking for something that you know, a familiar pattern.

2	Some (DaveSuperPowers) say most people who type themselves actually type themselves upside down. That is a consistent thing they've found with objectively testing people. That is because our 2 "savior" functions (either 1st and 2nd or 1st and 3rd) are so natural we don't think about them. Our "demon" functions, the other 2, are the ones we often proclaim to the world we are good at. The analogy they give is a little kid telling everyone he tied his shoe. As an adult you wouldn't do that because it is so natural you never think of it. But as a kid it is something that was a bit hard to do and you are proud and want everyone to know how good you are at it. So that is what they find with most people. Proclaiming their "demon" functions as their "saviors" because they are proud of them and want everyone to know how good at them. Meanwhile they think their "saviors" are their "demons" and thus to improve themselves they actually end up doubling down on them.\n\nThey (and others) say the only way to truly get typed is to ask people you know, friends, family, partners, exes, coworkers what are you strengths and weakness, what do they love about you and hate about you, what mistakes in life do they see you continually repeating, what are they envious about, etc. They say 10 is a good number and if 7 out of 10 are saying something then it is probably true. Because we can't see all of ourselves.\n\nThe reason I am saying this is because ISTJ's the upside down stack-wise of ENFP. Thus it is possible you are ISTJ and don't realize it. Ask those around you those questions I said and others. But make sure not to game the system like "Am I super disorganized and a slob or am I organized and cool?" etc. because they're obviously gonna say you're cool and organized.
1	Admit it: you love us.
26	Y'all have baby fever?	I'm a 21 year old guy. If you had told me 5 months ago that I'd want kids, I'd have called you nuts. But about 3 months ago, I caught baby fever. And it's \n\n*THROUGH*\n\n**THE**\n\n***ROOF***
12	I had always planned on having kids by the time I was 26 but I‚Äôm 22 now and the older I get, the less I want them. I‚Äôm really focused on myself, being successful and traveling though. 
9	Not even once 
6	This did happen to me at around 27/28.  So I had some babies!  But I was married & stable so maybe take your time.
5	I‚Äôm sure my ENFP-ness plays some role but I‚Äôve always been GREAT with kids and animals.\n\nHowever, it‚Äôs extremely frustrating because people assume that because I‚Äôm able to act goofy and childish that I‚Äôm not able to be serious and take care of a child. Also, I‚Äôm a guy so there‚Äôs that bogus stereotype as well.
5	Yesss. Doesn‚Äôt help that I work at an elementary school. It‚Äôs gotten so bad that whenever my boyfriend and I go out and there‚Äôs a baby, he first points it out and then when I almost cry over the cuteness, he very sternly tells me ‚Äúno. It‚Äôs not your turn‚Äù. I have it badddd. 
3	Hot take: ENFPs make the best dads.
4	It‚Äôs an 18-life sentence. Don‚Äôt. Do. It. üòÇ
2	r/childfree for those of you who don't want kids.
2	Always wanted them. Prioritized careers, and I‚Äôm really glad I did. But hell yeah, I‚Äôm planning to have a kid by next year now that I‚Äôve carved out a financially stable world to have one or two kids in. 
2	I‚Äôm a nanny. I get the kids without the 18 year commitment and weekends off üòÇ
2	Well, I do. Sometimes. But its mostly because Im in the age when everyone (srsly, its almost like a flu which spreaded) has kids now or is pregnant. But more important for me before its to find the kiddos proper dad. Im taking it too seriously
2	I really didn't want kids, which caused a few discussions in relationships. However one of my friends had a little girl, and while I was holding her...she opened her eyes, looked directly into mine, smiled, and laughed.....everyone in the room could hear my clock start ticking. 
2	yes mine has hit pretty hard but I‚Äôm old and female so it‚Äôs normal \n-infj
1	Lmaoo I‚Äôm a 28 year old guy and sometimes I get it like crazy too! It fluctuates. I‚Äôm also scared of the 18 years of commitment, no sleep, etc. X_x
1	Oh yes. My boyfriend and I just got a dog, so it's died down a little, but I love babies and would love to have my own.
-6	[deleted]
310	I know this is literally one of the top posts here, but I've never understood why I am who I am so well until I read this.	
41	Yessss. I am frighteningly open about my feelings and it is both the best and worst thing I have to offer the world.
19	My Uber ride home consisted of my uber driver explaining different parts of his life to. It was an enjoyable experience to say the least. 
12	When you compare ENFPs to the Enneagram Personality Test, Type 2 Helpers, Type 4 Artists, and Type 7 Adventurers seems to stand out the most.\n\nPrimarily identifying with Type 2 the most, this suuuuuuuper relates to me
10	I love this so much. When I love someone, they \*have\* to know. Why not? I love this group. This subreddit is the first place I feel like I belong. I don't usually comment bc I overthink what I'm goin to say and just change my mind. But, seriously, this post is my favorite. Thanks for sharing!
9	This gives me anxiety.
4	I suffered three strokes three years ago at 32 years old. I was 5 minutes away from death. I swore that this is literally how I‚Äôd live my life since that time. Life has never been better since. Sometimes the worst thing in your life turns you around for the best. Take risks. Enjoy yourself. Love with all your soul. Laugh, and make others laugh.
3	Beautiful 
3	I love that. So me
3	Fr the worlds a playground full of so many cool stories happening all the time, i want to experience as much as i can while im here
2	My life Lol
2	Thank you for posting this‚ô°. Had me all up in my feels tbh..
2	I wish this was me. I wish I wasn't so closed off with my intimate sentiments!
2	Thank you for sharing this, I needed to hear this today. Xx
1	I teared up reading this. I'm so glad someone has put it in words. 
5	What are some un-ENFP aspects of yourself?	I just saw a post like this on r/INTJ & thought it was a brilliant idea! As much as I'm fascinated by this MBTI stuff, I think that it's a broad generalization in many ways. \n\nSo let's hear it fellow ENFPs! What are some un-ENFP things you do? \n\nHere are some of mine:\n\n- I can be very detail-oriented\n\n- I don't flake out & try my best to stick to the original plan\n\n- Though I can be spontaneous, I generally like to make plans ahead of time. Too much spontaneity from others stresses me out\n\n- I don't easily get bored \n\n- I'm open to taking advices from my loved ones, unless they're being forceful \n\n- I can be very serious/calm and hide away my emotions
10	Falling in love with everybody. I definitely appreciate the positives in everybody and platonically love a lot of people but actually being in love? Takes a lot for that to happen.\n\nEverything you listed I do lmao, especially being flaky rip
5	I can "out-logic" my Thinker buddies (:
3	Very similair to you actually. Im always bored and restless (probably my add) but other than that, I relate to most of your points. \n\nBut I also think your points are also the sign of being mentally healthy and able to function in the real world. These things are things I‚Äôve had to learn, understand and feel WHY planning ahead is actually nice and neccessary, because too much spontaneity can be really stressful for example. \n\nIf that makes any sense?
2	I have a lot of minor infatuations, but when I fall into illogical love, damn. I am also super open to criticism, although I might temporarily disassociate to process it and see if it has any credit, but I find it one of the quickest ways for me to grow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	Looking introverted and sometimes being unsensitive\n
2	Not clingy. At all. Unless I'm in a bad emotional spot. Otherwise, I'm okay with long amounts of alone time. I'm also not the biggest fan of a lot of touchy-feely shit I read on here.
9	low key thoughts: i miss home	let me start by saying that the most important rule in life to me is this: no regrets. and that definitely holds true about my decision to move to germany four months ago. for most people it seems like i came here on a whim but in fact i‚Äôve thought about it for over three years, ever since experiencing some kind of magic dancing with strangers in the streets of berlin and wandering around the gardens of tempelhof aiport. organized, rational, efficient - a healthy dose of germany seemed like exactly what i needed. opposites attract, after all ;-)\n\nbut living in munich hasn‚Äôt been dancing in berlin. in fact, the first time i went out was a few weeks ago when i felt so isolated i went to a club by myself in the hopes of meeting someone, anyone. loneliness has never made sense to me as an emotion. there are seven billion in the world, after all - how should it make sense for anyone to feel alone, ever? i do not accept loneliness as an emotion, and i honestly don‚Äôt know if i ever can.\n\nand so for the past few months i‚Äôve trying to figure out this thing i‚Äôve been feeling. i carry it with me, from the morning - touch of fingers against screens - to the evening - kiss of wine against aubergine. it presses play, lets the light in, wraps you round curtains, blankets you, then proceeds to suffocate you.\n\nsome weekends i try to get away. i‚Äôm lucky the alps are so close. i find myself in garmisch-partenkirchen every other weekend. it reminds me of someone who made me feel something i hadn‚Äôt felt in over a year. for a few weeks i was convinced i‚Äôd spend the next christmas, perhaps retire, in northern scotland. and then of course, it broke my heart. it always does.\n\ni‚Äôm sleeping more on night buses than beds. last weekend i went to slovakia because i can‚Äôt be anywhere that seems close to anything i know anymore. i called my parents at 3am. they picked up. i told them i was sorry for everything. at the hostel there is this spanish dude who kisses me on the forehead when he sees me crying in the kitchen and randomly walks around proclaiming that¬†‚Äúlife! is beautiful.‚Äù it‚Äôs comforting, somehow.\n\nit‚Äôs my 28th birthday 2 days from today and i don‚Äôt know how i feel about it. i don‚Äôt even know who has my german phone number and who doesn‚Äôt. i wonder about going back to the states and if i‚Äôve missed any texts. or if there are none at all.\n\ni look down at my feet and avoid eye contact with people in the office, i don‚Äôt know why but every day i feel like i‚Äôm back in eighth grade looking for a seat in the lunch room. it makes me feel like shit - not my co-workers but rather my inability to just be myself. everyone seems way too cool for me. luckily my colleague is awesome; we bond over our mutual dislike of lunch which is a distraction from work. except we are secretly hungry and end up snacking on free chocolate all day.\n\nthese nights, i mostly find myself in vietnamese restaurants. i‚Äôm not even vietnamese. there is the lady who speaks to me in broken chinese and gives me a fifty cent discount on summer rolls; it low key breaks my heart each time. there is the restaurant near theresienstra√üe¬†that always packs me extra plum sauce. there are exchange students from shanghai who offer to help me with my luggage in hauptbahnhof as i move from my fourth to fifth airbnb.\n\ni‚Äôve never embraced the idea of having a home. always thought that home should be wherever your heart is, ever evolving, shape-shifting, never rooted, or god forbid: attached. but you know know? i fucking miss that shit. i miss target, i miss REI, i even miss like broadstone inifinity. what the fuck. i miss sitting around a fire, reciting cult lines from finding nemo, and burning our deepest darkest fears. i miss karaoke at rock box. i miss attempting to get high with people.\n\nfinally there is this music in the vienna train station on my way back to munich. there is a moment where i‚Äôm just completely overwhelmed by gratitude because i‚Äôm in vienna and someone‚Äôs playing piano. cause life‚Äôs weird, you know? but ‚Äúlife! is beautiful.‚Äù
4	Omg it‚Äôs my 29th birthday in two days and I vibe with this so hard. I think we as ENFPs feel loneliness more than most. I‚Äôm at home right now with my dog next to me and I still feel lonely, because I don‚Äôt have the type of connections that I long for...\n\nI know people say loneliness is a state of mind, but regardless- it‚Äôs not a wonderful feeling. I‚Äôm sorry, but this too shall pass. I‚Äôm here if you ever want to talk or need a friend. (:
2	I relate to none of this and all of it. I stick to more local adventures, but loneliness follows me. \n\nI don't know if you're religious or not, but I think that is one thing that leads me to believe in God. There I have felt utterly alone and forgotten, but when I've cracked open the scriptures or said a prayer I often feel a flood of love and hope. I feel known and understood, and it's beyond words. \n\nAnyway, there are moment where people or experiences have made me feel similarly (like the music on the Vienna train), and those are powerful moments too. I believe they are signs of Divine love, but whether you believe them to come from God or just the universe, they are undeniably important to making life worth living.\nThey keep me going on this crazy journey in which I find myself.
1	I'm away from home too. I feel you. I've been there. I'd advise you to create meaningful connections, to contact someone maybe through any organization. Are you running away from something? Are you feeling faithless regarding humanity? Meet some GOOD people. You need to recover some faith and some feeling for belonging
1	Hey, I thought about you. Have a look here. I hope you are doing well.\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/n3Xv_g3g-mA
3	Hey guys, I‚Äôm an ENFP type 4w3 & I created an IG where I share relatable post. If you‚Äôre interested take a look at my page & share your thoughts ‚ô•Ô∏è	
1	Amazing! I also identify as an ‚Äúintroverted extrovert‚Äù although I rarely find things on the internet about us. There‚Äôs a lot more out there about ‚Äúextroverted introverts‚Äù which IMO are completely different 
3	It's Too Excited Tuesday!	\nCAN I GET A HELL YEAH?! It's Too Excited Tuesday! Unleash the happy!\n\nWhat makes you excited? :D\n
7	How does music affect your life?	I've been on Reddit for years and never knew this Sub existed until today! I never found something so relatable on Reddit. (Except for my love over at r/TennesseeTitans ) \n\nI was curious what kind of music you like and the frequency you use music in your life. I find myself listening to older music but once I find a song I like, it‚Äôs crack. Listen to it on repeat, find live versions and read everything about them and try to find something similar. \n\nI love rock music. I love hearing the drums so from AC/DC, Pink Floyd, Pearl Jam, Godsmack, you name it. Buuuuutttt I‚Äôll break out 90s boy bands like that music just came out. Even will do some dances that I‚Äôll bust out at parties. There are YouTube videos out there of me even dancing in a ‚Äúboy band‚Äù 10 years ago! \n\nSo what kind of music moves my fellow ENFP folks? 
5	I listen to music constantly, it's such an important part of my life. I love all types of music and have lots of different playlists however I don't really divide them by genre. It's hard to explain but you know how songs are just great for eliciting a particular feeling or being used in specific movie scenes? I divide my playlists into that. \n\nFor example, I have a playlists for songs I'd listen to on a summer night at the beach, on a winter morning, walking down a busy city, sitting myself at night looking outside my window etc.
5	I listen to music constantly. I like to get high, longboard around the city and over dramatize the lyrics pretending that I am at the center of the universe as some tragic antihero. My favorite album of all time is American Idiot because it's literally about this. I'm really into indie rock atm but classic rock, grunge and punk is where my heart truly resides. \n\nCertain songs cultivate powerful emotions and other songs send you back in time.
3	Music literally sends shivers down my spine...like when all of sudden, a wave of pleasure runs through your body...like a tingling sensation...music does that to me
3	I listen to music all the time at work. It can change from hard rock, to 90's alt, to B.B King and Eric Clapton. Toss in some country once in a while. Fridays tho, 90's Britney and the sort, then BAM out comes Party Rock Anthem and Gangnam Style. 
2	Music guides my life! I don't listen to music by mood, but by season. I lean toward certain music that reminds me of whatever season it is to really put me in the mood of my environment. \n\nSummer:Surf rock \nFall: indie folk and bedroom pop \nWinter: atmospheric indie, more indie folk, dark indie \nSpring:some pop, mostly instrumentals\n\n I rarely listen to a song out of season. I also have super-specific playlists like "Songs My Mom Would've Listened to in the 80s" or "Songs that Sound Like a Movie Plot." I have an 8tracks account that I used to use years ago to help me organize my music in these ways. Am I the only one who does that? 
2	Super snob about music
1	Music has always been a big part of my life. It's mood lifting, therapeutic, and comforting, especially during life's lows. I listen to pretty much everything; what I listen to depends on my mood. In general, lyrics are incredibly important for me. I'd listen to songs that just sound good but it has to have some resonating/relatable lyrics for me to actually get me hooked. My favorite genres are metalcore and hard rock 
1	Music always correlates to time/memories for me, and sometimes emotions. I usually wake up to a song stuck in my head and that‚Äôs usually what I listen to that day. Songs always bring back memories of the first time I discovered them. \n\nWhen I discover new music that I really enjoy, which comes in waves because I have to be in the right mood, I listen to it on repeat for days to months. If I really feel struck by an album, I research the artist vigorously and read the meaning behind the lyrics. I learn every word, every melody, and it never leaves my head. I feel like a piece of me is missing, or that I have a scratch to itch, if I can‚Äôt listen to that album. \n\nI generally like newer ‚Äúemo/punk‚Äù music (ie, real friends, moose blood, mom jeans, the front bottoms) or sad narrative acoustics (the mountain goats, flatsound, pinegrove, bright eyes). Some pop and rap too. \n\nI love music!! But it‚Äôs rare that I share it with someone, because I feel that I can‚Äôt accurately explain the connection I have with the song or album :/ 
2	How would you describe an ENFP 4w3 tritype 4w3-7w6-9w8 sx/so?	
12	I wouldn't. I have no clue what that means. Hope that helps!!
1	Emotional üò≠ type 4w3 sometimes I feel as if I were an INFP I feel very introverted at times 
1	dude i am literally this exact tritype and enfp and sx pls message me lamo
1	Extremely eccentric, but in an out-there, expressive way. Generally very positive for a 4. Pretty much your standard ENFP. Might see themselves as an introvert, but nobody else would.
9	Not relating to other Enfps (Males)	It seems as of late there have been many posts about male enfps and how they have more female friends and that they're softer than most people they know. I cant relate to this much. Like yeah i'm definitely more sensitive in how I perception than most of my friends (like 80% male) but i'm not soft really. \n\nI definitely feel more dominant and masculine than I am soft. I feel like a normal "dude". enfp males are relatively rare and most who are enfp I cant seem to relate with that much. My enfp friends (2) In real life I relate with pretty easily but honestly half the time I cant really relate to much of the stereotypical enfp persona. Yeah i'm really emotional and sensitive and stuff but im also pretty grounded compared to many posts on here. Does anyone else feel this way, as in not relating to the typical enfp post on here, especially guys? Or even better, girls who cant relate to the excessive emotion and being scatterbrained \n\nAnd before the obligatory comment, I know this is just a grouping and "ENFP" doesn't define the individual. I am just interested in peoples view on this
4	Navy beat the "softness" out of me for the most part. I only share stuff like that with really close people who I know would appreciate it. Other than that I can come across early on in a friendship or even relationship as kind of a dick. But even that's not really who I am. So I get what you're saying for the most part, I've just learned to separate the 2. 
3	Yuuup. I'm pretty salty and sarcastic. Sense of humor shades towards evil. I do have a LOT of female friends, most of whom I've had sex with but we really are just friends at this point. \n\nLike with any stereotype, people who find truth in it perpetuate it and you get a confirmation bias
3	This sub is more ~Feely~ than Intuition, mostly because this sub is just filled with therapy posts which really isn't an issue with me, but I can defintely relate to you. I don't check this sub as often as I do r/ENTP mainly because most of the conversations on there really intrigue me, (I could be an ENTP but who knows), but MBTI subreddits really are just more personal, more emotional people get typed as 'F's and more apathethic people get typed as 'T's and those conceptions float to the subs as well. Some people see r/ENFP as just Creative emotionals, look at any NF sub other than ENFJ, it's a near constant stream of therapy, it's more of an nF while NT subs are more Nt(except r/INTJ). ENFP stereotype is also pretty stupid as well, anyone who shits rainbows for a living would drive me cynical in a minute. Most of the people who actually try and follow the stereotypes are commonly ExFJs and maybe ESFPs. These are just my opinions atleast, apologies if I came off cold in this post haha, but you're not alone
2	ESFP? that would make your cognition really close to ENFP.\n\nESFP: love to have fun and flirty conversations but not too much deep thought\n\nENFP: love deep thought conversations, the deeper the better!\n\nESFP: more grounded, have high common sense and quick reflexes\n\nENFP: get lost too much in our heads to even see that there is ground in the first place
2	Not relating to the people on this subreddit, doesnt make you less enfp or odd in any way. \nThere‚Äôs a lot of dramatic and chaotic posts here.\n\n‚Äî A lot of people here are probably young. So probably as mature/grounded as for example you, or others outside of this subreddit. (dont know your age, but you get my point)\n\n‚Äî People are self-typed. A lot of ENFPs that act like what you‚Äôre describing, might be ESFP and not ENFP.\n\n‚Äî Mental illness. I have struggled with ADD and BPD, and I see a lot of my past symptoms and struggles, posted on here like its a quirky ENFP thing, which I think is lowkey alarming. \n\n‚Äî People are different. Personality types dont dictate who you are as much as people think they do.
1	I can definitely relate to you. I like to think it's because of the rough times I gone through before entering college. I believe it toughen me as a man and it made me stronger mentally.
1	maybe we're "soft" due to how we are raised, in what world we were raised\n\nenfp born in a mongol horde would probably not declaim poetry, but would have some of this quirkiness of enfp type
1	girl enfp, not very scatterbrained. emotional though. 
1	well I have excessive emotions and am scatterbrained on the outside, but I've learnt to hide those a be a 'normal dude' around other 'dude's (its like i have switch on the inside for when to activate *dude mode*) 
1	ENFP male currently in corporate world and been trained in academia for some time. Throughout my time in university and work, I learned how to develop logical thoughts and compromising with my emotions. 
1	The scatterbrained thing and other things are mostly stereotypes. And if people do mention them here I find they are most often younger ENFP's who haven't matured or developed Te much or even Fi. I feel like most ENFP's have deep emotions but we only show it to a close few. And as for being grounded it usually means you have a lot of Te. I do too in the last years and definitely am more assertive. But I will say it is not "soft" to have female friends or have emotions or be sensitive.
1	Phew yes! Needed someone to raise this point. Traditionally masculine ENFP dude here. 
6	Is this common behavior for ENFP male?	I'm an INFJ female with an ENFP boyfriend. We have been through a lot of emotional highs and lows and there's some things that are inching me towards a breakup. I'm really trying to maintain the relationship but at this point I'm questioning if it's worth it anymore. I want to know if these are common behaviors for an ENFP or if it's just him. ENFP is supposed to be my ideal match. In a lot of ways, it is, but in others I'm losing my mind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. He tells me to be honest with him and that he doesn't like to be lied to (I've never lied to him)...yet he tells little white lies to me all the time. Like disclosing information to people about us that he denies doing at first and then later admits.\n2. He seems to enjoy tricking the system. He'll do postmates sometimes for extra money and he will eagerly seek to walk away with an order for free every time he does it. He says "Oh, they didn't come and get it". But he literally enjoys when someone doesn't respond after a couple minutes so he can drive off with it. He doesn't leave it on the doorstep.\n3. He'll short stick others (like the postmates thing) but is pissed off if someone does it to him. He has standards that he holds others to, but doesn't hold himself to.\n4. He is incredibly selfish. He can be very loving and generous on occasion but when we have a disagreement - he's always the victim. He will literally threaten to walk away from our relationship over seemingly minuscule comments.\n5. He is very secretive. We live together and he doesn't ever want to disclose how much money he has, he locks his phone, computer and anything else that I am assuming has personal information on it. But it's to the point where we use his computer on our projector and I can't ever set it up because it's on such hardcore lockdown.\n6. I feel like he's always considering better "options" for relationships. Like he's completely open if a woman came along and started talking to him and they clicked. But if I did that with another man, he'd be livid.\n7. If he does something wrong, it takes him a long time to apologize for it and when he does say "sorry" it's followed with a lot of tears for the next couple of hours.\n8. He takes everything personally. If he wants to hurry up and go somewhere and he's hounding me, if I say "can you please be patient and give me 5 minutes?" He'll literally get quiet and refuse to go after that.\n9. He's very critical of others while driving or people watching, but other times if I make a random comment about someone he corrects me for not having empathy.\n\nThe things I do like about him are that he's funny, energetic, a dreamer, adventurous, outgoing, dominant but emotional and we can sometimes be in sync in many ways. Our values align on religion and politics. He cares way too much about his parents and though he seems a little weary to commit to marriage or children, he's good with my child from a previous relationship. So, is this ENFP typical mindset or is he just mentally/emotionally unhealthy in general?
5	Those are all pretty negative and I understand you leaning towards a breakup in all of those. It sounds less like enfp personality and more like a product of behavior. 
6	We enfps can be self absorbed, hippocritacal, sporadic arseholes sometimes. Looking for perfection and then comparing what we have to what we could have which tends to be pretty counterproductive. Some enfps end up being manipulative and really unpleasant which is what this sounds like. At the end of the day everyone regardless of type is an individual in their own right and it sounds like he's not being good for you. I hope things get better for you. At the end of the day be happy! 
3	I experienced 4,7 and 8 in my previous relationship with an ENFP. Im and INFJ female. So I definitely can relate to those points. My ex was incredible sensitive and stubborn and he always blamed me for everything in our relationship. I think you have to be really honest with yourself and see if the pros out weigh the cons. And if he's not going to change, are you ok with this? Please pit yourself first, because I didnt, and I regret it.
2	I‚Äôm an INFP with an ENFP friend. I would say he does not ever do these things, but he is still quite young and can grow into more bad habits as he ages. \n\nI would not base a relationship on ‚Äúoh we are supposed to be compatible‚Äù because that doesn‚Äôt mean much in the real world. If he‚Äôs not a guy you want around you or your children then let him go.

Less than I used to because I realized if I used exclamation marks for everything they didn't carry the same level of intensity that I meant, but they're still there because I get excited about pretty much everything. \n\nStill guilty of run-on sentences and parentheses for everything, though. I try to sound normal but I write at the speed that I'm thinking and I'm thinking too many things at once, so sometimes a little detour is needed. :)
1	Yesss lol sometimes I over analyze the situation and then I‚Äôm like, ‚Äúwait, this is too much‚Äù üòÇ and then I‚Äôll put a period but then feel like it‚Äôs too dull. üò©üòÇ
1	Yes yes yes! My friends always tell me off when I overuse them because I apparently sound super argumentative and forceful about evrything üòÖ but it's mainly just because I'm excited or whatever about what I'm writing! Everything sounds way to bland if there aren't enough exclamation marks.
1	Also semicolons ;)
1	I use it mainly because I am considerate of others‚Äô feeling.\n\nFor example, ‚Äúsee you soon!‚Äù sounds more enthusiastic than the cold ‚Äúsee you soon‚Äù.\n\nThat being said, I don‚Äôt know whether the exclamation successfully conveys enthusiasm or it makes the other person views me as childish. Logically, since people are different, some people would like the use of exclamation point, some wouldn‚Äôt, and some wouldn‚Äôt care. I don‚Äôt know whether the amount of consideration I put in my words are actually effective or negative, but I would do it anyway just in case.
1	Getting confused as an ENTP	I am often confused as an ENTP, because the way I convey my thoughts seems logical. Does anyone else have a similar experience? I think it‚Äôs because of my Te trait. Any alternative explanations? Thoughts? 
1	But ENTP's don't have Te. They are more about arguing for arguing's sake. Te is more about action.
1	Rest	Hello, fellow ENFPs\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm having trouble de-stressing. As similar to many of you, I imagine, my thoughts are often racing since I'm thinking of the next thing to do. How do you de-stress, calm your thinking, and collect your thoughts for the day? I've thought about journaling and meditation. However, I think it would be boring and unnecessary to journal every day. 
5	One thing that has really helped me is continually re-assuring myself with "All i have to do right now is _______"  then I repeat it to myself at infinitum lol it helps a lot when i get my mind in a shit tornado of thoughts. 
2	RUNNING. Any kind of exercise.
1	Archery. There's an outdoor range that's free to use near me. Its up on a hill where there's no cell service. It forces me to focus and calm my mind while still keeping my hands busy. And its fun. I can wear headphones and no one bothers me,
5	I just thought of this...but it might describe us: Kiss hard...love harder.	
1	Mind elaborating?
11	A question to all Male ENFPs...	Is it a common thing for us guys to have a lot of female friends (as in female friends >= male friends), but like *0 luck* when it comes to relationships? Are we the by-default *"You're like my brother/closest friend but I don't feel the same about you"* people. Or is it just me lol.
8	That's been my experience.\n\nThat said, I friendzone just as much or more than I am friendzoned. 
6	So far it's been the same for me, because of that I now try being more straightforward when I like someone and letting her know from a start how I feel about her.
7	Through most of my teens and early twenties I felt the same way! I had a lot of close female friends but never had a girlfriend until I was 22 years old (which lasted 3 months.). Now at 28 years old, I have been with my partner for over 4 years, and she has opened my eyes to the fact that there were women that were interested/gave me signs but I just didn‚Äôt process that information (even though a few made it very obvious.) 
5	I'm pretty oblivious to anyone else's interest so yeah I'm single. I also have more close female friends. 
3	You need to approach someone you like as someone you like from the start. Trying to be a friend first and transition to a relationship doesn't work most of the time. Flirt, be a little risque even, act like they are flirting with you, just be yourself, genuine, ask questions while telling a little about you. Try to see if they match your standards. And you should have standards. Don't settle. Find your perfect person and make it clear you are interested. If you ask her out make it clear it is a date and be confident. Instead of "Hey want to hang out sometime?" or something like that be decisive and specific: "Hey, do you want to go out to dinner with me Thursday? 8 o'clock at (restaurant)?"
3	Litterally like 80% of my friends are females but as for relationships.... 2 long distances that fizzled out and I'm the go to 'friend guy'. But then again I've had a few almosts with girls where it's because if these really awesome mutual connections and just sharing the shit out of each others personal lives until like 2 am. That or I just spend so much time getting to know people, caring for them, and making sure they share my values that by the time I'm ready for something, they stick me in the friendzone. Fun days. Glad I'm not alone in that üòÇ
2	My husband's an ENFP (I'm an INTJ) and yes, he does have a lot of female friends, but he also gets along great with guys too, I've always found this really interesting, as a lot of guys are awful at hanging out with women.  Just keep being you, eventually you'll meet someone special and they will value you for who you are.  You don't really want the girls who are just going to toy with you anyway, in the end you should want to be with someone who appreciates you for who you are and you don't have to act different in order for them to like you.
2	The struggle is real.
2	When I was younger it was like this, but this changed as I got older...and fitter. I started to be more intentional in my interactions and just be obvious. So, I friendzone, but don't look down on yourself being friendzoned, that could be a blessing. Having friends is amazing, and having friends that are girls means you get to meet even more girls.
2	[deleted]
2	I can greatly relate to this, even as I have been able to have friends across both genders, I find myself the frequent friend of women in ways other guys don't understand. \n\nRomantic relationships are intimidating and when I recognize that a female will be just a friend, I am so much much more comfortable to be myself. I find that women have alternative viewpoints that I don't get from male friends and I appreciate multiple points of view.\n\nCrossing the rubicon into a real relationship is something I have had very little luck with, though, based off a recent dating experience, I recognize that I have no intention of settling for something less. All these positive relationships I've fostered with the opposite sex have fostered quality improvements in the way I act and live. When someone worth it comes around, I will be ready.\n\nOr I'll die single. Even then, I won't die alone.
2	Go find an INTJ to marry! Worked out so far for me.
1	It's just based on your facial attractiveness. \n\nAlmost all of my friends were either girls that were attracted to me, but are not anymore, or those that are attracted to me but we never flirted because I didn't like tham that much\n\nUltimate redpill is to invest all your savings into plastic surgery. As I'm not good looking anymore, that would totally be the best money spent ever
1	You might be a Nice Guy. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't be a Nice Guy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRead No More Mr. Nice Guy. 
1	I hate being enfp , finding out I am one has just made life seem completely futile.
53	It's a real challenge to want someone to talk to, but at the same time feeling easily fatigued by people	Does anyone else struggle with this? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI should preface to say that, firstly, I am still kinda recovering from a breakup that happened over a year ago. Long story short, I left my partner because I wasn't ready for commitment. I've been working through a lot of personal issues, but it's a slow climb. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI find myself equally wanting human connection, but not feeling like anyone is worthwhile enough to spend a lot of time with. Don't get me wrong though, I love my friends and enjoy seeing them. I also enjoy my coworker's company. But when I don't want to socialize, I am the biggest grump and just want to be left alone. It's almost like a switch, and it can go in either direction. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor example, most days when I go to work, I don't like when some of my coworkers are cheery and sociable in the mornings. But when they engage me in something interesting or funny, all of the sudden my mood brightens up and I just want to talk instead of work. Then there are the times when I am enjoying myself talking to friends at a party, and suddenly I am overcome with a sense of boredom, anxiety, disconnection, and I find myself desiring to be at home curled up on the couch. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know that I'm 50/50 I/E and I'm still trying to figure myself out. Just thought I'd share.\n\n&#x200B;
14	I don't have a simple response to this, but I'll try.\n\nThe "not feeling like anyone is worthwhile enough to spend a lot of time with" is most relatable except I have a small number of people with whom I always want to spend time, but I'm super picky. \n\nThere are a large percentage of people that fall into the often-wish-we-weren't-hanging-out-mid-hangout though. But I realize how selfish that sometimes can be and I try and enjoy myself or at least make others feel good about being there. I make my own fun. 
7	I totally feel ya. I'm so so sooo picky about who I spend time with. I have a lot of friends, but I only make and accept plans when I'm 100% sure I want to, and even then I cancel last minute a LOT.    I love people, but I also love control and optimizing my time
6	This is how I feel about dating. I like to make meaningful connections but at the same time I'm not that interested by many people and find it hard to care sometimes.
3	Hey, I can totally relate!\n\n>	But when they engage me in something interesting or funny, all of the sudden my mood brightens up and I just want to talk instead of work\n\nTo this, especially\n\nI think it‚Äôs an ENxP thing to be fueled by both ideas and people. Some of us are very social, while some of us are more in the middle (everyone isn‚Äôt either a wallflower or the life of the party)\n\nI could be surrounded by people and aloof. Something interesting happens or I find some people that I connect with or we start talking about something intruiguing? Boom! Now you can‚Äôt shut me up and I‚Äôm laughing and telling all the jokes\n\nIt‚Äôs cool to need some time alone and to need some time with people
2	Yeah because no one is really willing to go underneath the surface and talk about shit that matters
1	Omg you described this perfectly!! So fatigued. The wave of boredom, anxiety, and ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather be doing anything else right now...‚Äù\n\nI try my best to live in the moment. It‚Äôs difficult to do but it definitely helps. Be careful of ‚Äúenergy vampires‚Äù as we are empaths and can sometimes feel everyone / everything. \n\nNature helps me to recharge my battery but I do have to limit my contact with people, as I can feel fatigued after a few hours. #ENFProblems \n\nX
2	Is this abusive? Having serious doubts about my relationship with my long term S.O. ME (27F [ENFP]) & boyfriend (27M[ENTP]).	  \n\nQUESTION:\n\nAm I in an abusive relationship? Is this person the right path for me? Should I continue on this road and hope we both grow?\n\nLet's call him Sean.\n\nGENERAL TIMELINE BACKGROUND:\n\n¬∑ My SO & I met at the young age of 3 years old. Went to PRE-K to 4th grade together. I had a mega crush on him in 1st grade, and when my 6 year old self found the courage to tell him, his reply was naturally...."Ew Cooties."\n\n¬∑ Through these years we attended birthday parties & social events together as our parents were friends but he always hated me/thought i was "weird AF."\n\n¬∑ I leave school in 4th grade, attend another school & high school. We don't see each other.\n\n¬∑ We bump into each other at the age of 18 as I'm on a date with another man at a bar where Sean is very drunk. We talk, he Facebook messages me, and a 'relationship' is born.\n\n¬∑ Two years of casual "dating"/hooking up as I'm away for college. Every break I spend wanting to be with him...\n\n¬∑ I move back at age of 20 and we decide to give it a go. We date on and off for few months at a time.\n\n¬∑ I leave him at age 21, because he kissed a girl on his bday in a club. Silly young things.\n\n¬∑ Fast forward to age 23 we give it a more serious try. Dating for 3-4 months and then, he moves into my apartment with me out of necessity and desire.\n\n¬∑ Now we moved into a better apt for (2) and at age 27 we're living comfortably together for 4/5 years.\n\nBAGGAGE:\n\n¬∑ I come from a childhood of abuse - physical, verbal, and emotional. I was abused by my parents from teenage years through adulthood. At age 21, I packed a bag and left, completely unprepared for life and very naive. I had narcissistic helicopter parents who kept me very dependent on them and not allowing me to develop my own judgement skills. So now, I cannot judge if my relationship IS or IS NOT healthy, if I am RIGHT or WRONG. I am no longer in touch with my parents. It hurts everyday to not have them though they hurt me.\n\n¬∑ Sean has a case of being spoiled with opportunity. Always being given an opportunity whether it be a job hook up from a friend, a trip from a relative. Now understand...NOT spoiled at all but also NO fire in the belly.\n\nTOGETHER AS A COUPLE:\n\nWe are the "FUN COUPLE." If you want to have a good time? If you want your night filled with laughs, jokes, culture, creativity, dancing, etc. You call us to be there. We poke fun at everyone and everything around us, even each other.\n\nWe care for one another.\n\nHe is great at deep cleaning the home and loves to cook. I enjoy revamping the home, filling our social calendar, and planning our lives together, making positive changes.\n\nI am more of a planner, I enjoy planning ahead for trips, goals, and direction in life.\n\nHe takes things more day to day.\n\nWe enjoy most couple things from a night in of netflix, to a date night at a comedy show, to a beach day.\n\nHe and I are both great with each other's family. Both of our families treat the other like they are family.\n\nMY DOUBTS SUMMARY:\n\nWe get into really hardcore arguments. I fear that I am the cause of them because this is how I was raised. I raise my voice and get very heated in topics of planning for the future...whether it be a vacation or deciding on a place to live. I feel he does not take life by the horns and direct it into a vision and rather let's life happen to us, allows us to be victims of circumstance.\n\nSAMPLE ARGUMENT:\n\nI raise my voice, he provokes me, i keep yelling, he throws a cup of water on me, i yell more, he calls me horrible names, i try to get him to listen to me, he refuses, storms off and the response i get is "f\*ck off" "please leave me, i beg you"\n\nEvery other day we are leaving each other. I think we fear that this is really it for us now and it is the time of S\*it or get off the pot." We have talked about marriage but again it seems far off and not like something he has given any planning to. I want things to be supportive and to move forward, but we keep cycling in this and not moving anywhere.\n\nINSULTS:\n\nHis insults cut deep but i don;t think he means them at all.\n\nWhile i do have a temper and yell and get frustrated...i do not insult.\n\nWe're on a diet and he caught me eating, saying, "can't wait until your big belly comes back"\n\n"i'd rather not have a gf that doesn't care about her looks"\n\n"you're a cancer, this is why you have no family" (the pain on this one is in explainable)\n\nrecords me yelling at him and sends it to HIS mother.\n\nHe throws things, punches walls, etc.\n\n"you're abusive just like your family"\n\n"you're over sensitive"\n\n"im moving out" "i'm done" (every time we fight - which makes me freak out that i need to gather resources if i need to be on my own)\n\nrude texts etc\n\nThis happens regularly, about twice a month. They vary in how bad they get, but they could happen after we have the BEST night together loving each other.\n\nI am tired of living like this, in fear. I have for many many years. I am also tired of waiting for future plans. I'm not a girl that just wants a ring, but I fee like at this point we should know and should have a plan. I'm afraid of living in this endless cycle because I am used to it. I stay because I fear it will be this way with any man because I am the problem, the broken one.\n\nI love him, I want him to have a happy life, but I too want a happy life.\n\nPlease weigh in on your thoughts or concerns.\n\nDo you think our dynamic is toxic? Have you had experience in this?\n\nHow can I end this cycle?\n\nHow will I know he is the one for me? I wish we had more passion, but we have already been together for years and are comfortable.\n\nIs this a cycle we will pass through because of the pressures that exist at our age of marriage and future planning?\n\nDo you think the way I described us and our relationship should be the way a woman should describe the man she is considering spending her life with?\n\nWhen we fight that badly, I plan to leave. I have no resources to do so, so I freak out and start my apartment search. I have even considered going to a shelter just to get away some days. By that time, he apologizes. I rationalize and also apologize for my part in it.
3	Well, it is not a healthy loving relationship. There should be no tearing each other down, only building each other up. There should be respect, so definitely no name calling but also respect of each other's feelings. \n\nENFPs have trouble processing feelings due to Fi being a pain the ass. We go in Ne Te loops, basically do everything we can to avoid feeling any vulnerability. \n\nHere is the game of working hard to be good enough to be loved but yet do not want feel loved because you do not want to feel vulnerability. so he is more attractive when it is time to do repair work on the relationship, but when things are going great, someone better start a fight so you do not feel!! If he did start to treat well, like actually treat you with love and respect, that will make you feel the pain of loss, loss of the love that your parents failed to give you but you still rightfully deserved, and then it is too painful and dangerous to feel, so you will just want to dump him.\n\nIt is probably the same story on his side, and that is how this relationship is working. \n\nif you do get healing from your past, you may find that you will outgrow him and seek for someone healthier. \n\n&#x200B;
3	If you feel like you're living in fear, if he's giving you ultimatums, if he's hitting where it hurts and leaves you more often than not... \nLeave. This isn't a functional relationship. He may not realize he's hurting you, he may not mean it, but he is. And you may be hurting him as well without realizing it. \n\nIt reminds me of the dynamic I had with my INTP ex. We were together over 5 years and appeared to everyone like a fun-loving couple always down for adventures, full of inside jokes, but he had this way of cutting deep into my insecurities anytime I did something which displeased him. Took me a while to realize the extent to which the relationship had hurt me after he eventually left me. We're still friends, even neighbors now, but we both needed to do a lot of growing up, and we'd never consider being in a romantic relationship. \n\nSometimes good people with the best intentions are bad for each other. Don't let him keep you from finding your future. :)
2	You both need to mature and each get therapy.  I'd suspect you'd have the same issues if you pursued other relationships.
0	I came across a book (love and respect ) that explained something you may be able to use. Not sure if i can explain it well so i would suggest researching it.... if you are interested.  I was reading through the sample fight paragraph and thought about this.  I wanted to help you meet your needs and avoid being hurt inthis and future relationships.  Also i have tested it out and it works.\n\nMales need to be respected and to lead = Females need love.  The way you need love he needs respect and leadership.\n\nYes i am completly on your side and agree that you cant respect someone who is so hurtful.  So at first you have to fake/force it. After a time it will get better.\n\nI couldnt get the image in here but a google sear h will bring it up.  Imagine a circle.\n\nEnergizing cycle\nHis love motivates her respect motivates his love ..........\n\n\nCrazy cycle\nWithout love she disrespects. With out respect he is unloving ...........\n\nHope this is helpful\n
31	I never watched Dr. Who, but I truly believe this portion will make all of you cry like it made me cry.	
7	One of my favorite Doctor Who episodes. The whole episode is lovely and slightly sad. Amy, the redhead, learns a sad lesson from this, which is that she can't always make things better by time-traveling. Van Gogh still committed suicide after Amy and the Doctor showed him the future.
5	The music is absolutely beautiful 
5	Dude I balled, full on snot like Niagara Falls 
3	I did not cry, but literally only cuz it distracted me to find out that Scrimgeour wasn't dead after all.
2	This episode & the star whale get me right in the feels every timeüò≠
2	This is the episode I show people that have never seen Doctor Who (IT'S DOCTOR not Dr. ;P)\n\nI'm sad you only posted this because the rest of the episode and the context makes it even sadder. 
1	First of all you should watch Doctor Who. It is incredible and full of moments like this as well as laughs and action and pain.\n\nSecond of all *tears*
1	... fuck you for bringing this back up on my life. This episode emotionally wrecked me when I first watched it.
3	Self-employed ENFPs, what does your work day look like? (How to optimize happiness when working alone?)	**TL;DR Just curious in trying out new ways of doing my solo work throughout the day to optimize fulfillment. For example, do you wake up and hustle early morning alone? Or do you get morning coffee with friends and use the social energy to work late morning solo?!**\n\n**And even if you're not self-employed but have a happy workflow you'd like to share or ideas, share it!** Here's my situation (long post):\n\nI am a self-employed ENFP. It's awesome. It's all online too, freedom is so important to me so I can work anywhere in the world anytime. \n\nHowever I'm always open to switching up my schedule to become more efficient/happy. Right now, my schedule looks something like this:\n\nWake up, meditate, work out, then get to work. I focus on work until lunch, and am usually done before then. If not I eat lunch, finish work, then hangout with friends in the evening. \n\nSometimes, this schedule can be lonely. Sometimes it's super efficient. I live alone which I prefer (Fi time!). In one of my fav cities I would work at a coffee shop filled with other self-employed internet entrepreneurs, which felt great. Right now I don't get recognized while working in a coffee shop and it's usually best to work at home.\n\nNow here's where things get interesting: I don't have many friends (or deep ones) in this current city (I am waiting for a visa for the other one). I do however have a friend who needs help growing his company here. I've been going into their office, and I must say I LOVE the praise, attention, respect, etc that is given to me. \n\nThe thing is... The commute is long, and the pay is hardly what I'm used to. I am used to 2-5x more pay. This should change when we take things off (which it is). Despite that, I'm secretly enjoying it. It feels so damn good to have a team of 5 people execute on my ideas for me. \n\nI've considered starting my own agency before, but that conflicts with my value of travel and freedom. But oh damn does it feel good making decisions which is saving the company and employment of the team. And we ENFPs quite honestly struggle with long term execution so having this team is a blessing, allowing me to focus on ideas & strategy while they focus on implementation. Their praise feels so good. I feel deeply valued & respected.\n\nNow, again I'd like to mention that in the country I'm trying to move to, my social circle is amazing, deep, etc so I tend not to get as lonely while working. It is possible I just need more social time and working with the company is a way for me to get that. And I couldn't ever see myself working with a company long term unless it's on my rules because I hate being told what to do (such ENFP). I am highly independent in that way. \n\nAnyways, I'm moving away soon. This isn't my city. It's been a great experience. It also makes me want to experiment with my daily routine to be happier and more productive with my work. \n\n**One ENFP on a random post (which is inspiring this one) said, "I have to get morning coffee with friends before work so that my brain is all excited and energized for work.**\n\nThis had never came into my mind! I wonder, what if I worked out with friends, we ate and hungout briefly, then I went to work? Then after I'd hangout with more friends! Would this early morning social interaction help energize me for my work day? Another personal idea is to advertise myself as someone who can come into a company and fix their processes, workflow, etc so I occasionally get that respect and attention while not sacrificing freedom. \n\nSo, I ask all ye dear ENFPs (xD), what ideas haveth you for about being fulfilled with your workflow? How do you go through your day? What does your schedule look like?
3	Responding so I can follow. I'm hoping to begin the journey to becoming self employed soon (:
2	You just gave me so much inspiration right now. That‚Äôs my ideal life.. and as an ENFP it proves to me how possible it is for us. \n\nI probably would do everything I have to do first workout, work etc. Then meet with friends after, just because if I meet with friends first I‚Äôd probably be sort of exhausted after, and probably not have the same energy. \n\nBut that‚Äôs just me maybe for you it‚Äôll be better that way! 
1	Heyoooo, not self employed, but I'm a gradstudent so all of my production is on my own shoulders AND I work from home. Because you asked: wake up at 8, make my partner (the sweetest hooman I've ever met {INFP, if you care}) some breakfast while taking my herbs and so on, then we eat really fast. If it's a work from home day, I will send her off, lift some wheights while watching some comedy on youtube ([mostly this amazing mofo](https://www.reddit.com/r/PaymoneyWubby/)) with a notepad next to me waiting to remember the stuff I should take care of that day or the next. Then I tidy up, I go up to my office, and work through things on priority with a time limit (outlining each task so I don't need to wait for inspiration to remember what I need to do), and then I work till I'm exhausted. The evening is spending time with my love. If I  have to be at work for a lecture or to meet with my prof, I get ready, drop my lovely lady off at 9, then local errands or strait to school if there's no time. Then, I either wait until I can leave, catch up with people who I've been neglecting too much, then sneak out before the grumposauruses know I'm around (just presumptive assholes who have demonstrated that they care more about their own comfort than other people's feelings...including my abusive ex-advisor who has her own internal pain to deal with). Then, it's the same as always with everything based on when I can be back with my partner.\n\nI am NOT the most efficient person, and I REALLY admire your present setup. You are really killing it so much ... and though you maybe didn't want direct advice, I just want to share some impressions (not that you haven't thought of most, but just incase you aren't having as much self-compassion for future-you's difficulties) so you can have one more voice in your head. Plus, if you aggreed, it's not like anything I say won't be more refined for your life to the point it's totally your own, so ... anyways, here's the riff.\n\nFor someone with so much to offer, I'm a bit concerned for future-you. I wouldn't be able to tell if it were me, but the long-term implications of so many of the factors you gave are really REALLY important and severely limit your ability to have self expression. I know there is a strong attraction to the newness and the shininess of this chance...but imagine the flip side. I used to do an hour & a half commute in the bay area so I could keep working at school and stuff...I should not have done that. The ability to write down your ideas, to take notes, to talk to friends, to maximize your creative output and energy...it will be slowly draining to make your commute better, but after 2 months dealing with drivers who couldn't care less about your safety & intention to just be safe and happy...it really sucks. Throw the issues of authority and rigidness into the mix and I would regret the decision immediately.\n\nBut I also think it sounds like you've found a real calling here ... that you should maximize in the long term...with consulting. Honestly, this company sounds dope, but there are so many amazing people that could really benefit from your spark of energy to get the fire started and, lets face it, you're sparking up that company like a badass now (and you are)...and that's what's great about flint, it's dependable and always ready to start the fire...but that doesn't mean it should stay by a specific fire just because it was adequately set up for your sparks...it means you know how more fires need to be set up for you to be effective. In other words, you've found an awesome way to find people who will automatically open themselves up to (and even *desire*) you to express your Ne through Te and Fi (hope I used those properly) to their own betterment...but you got there *because* you have been letting yourself flourish at home.\n\nIf I might suggest something: maybe say that you will take the job (full speaking volume) a few times and pretend like you've made the decision and will be having your next several weekdays taken over by this. Try meditating and run a mental simulation of the commute, hearing the same songs/audiobooks without being about to fine-tune what you wanna do, having at least a few crappy drivers in your way, then getting in, getting back to a longer term projects... and then imagine the trip home when you just want to have your personal tools back in your grasp. Is this one option worth the loss of all your others ... and even more with depleted funds. \n\nI guess I'm asking that you make sure whether you, a plant with really great wide-branching leaves, have actually found a far better pot to be trasplanted...or if you've just found a good light source and are realizing that you can't reach it from your current position and, therefore, need to resist abandoning your foundation. If the latter is true, I think you know the answer: don't jump the gun, wait for a trellis so your branches can reach not ONLY that light, but the whole freaking building.
1	Frustrated with my ENFP	I tried to talk to my ENFP (I am an INTJ) before bed about certain things I felt unhappy about the past few days between us. She just ended up saying one sentence to reply me and didn‚Äôt reply me afterward. (She had her back towards me)\n\nSo I was silent for around 5 minutes because I had stated my point and told her what I felt, and decided ok fine this is going nowhere, so I just ‚Äúfine, everything is my fault‚Äù just to end this ‚Äúconfrontation‚Äù that I initiated to go somewhere. Ends up she fell asleep?!?! (Not sure if she was faking it)\n\n\nLong story short, what happened previously was she lost her phone. I lent her my spare. She kept complaining about the speed, and then she cracked the monitor, ended up accidentally falling down the toilet... I was very calm when I said ‚Äúyou cracked my phone, and now it went down the toilet??‚Äù And she went ballistic with me, yelling at me saying she didn‚Äôt mean to do it, and why am I always giving her grief about breaking my phone and she bought me my phone... and stormed out the door\n\nSo I ended up going to Apple and getting her a new phone (signing it on credit for now but will pay it back ASAP), and by the time she got home she was like ‚Äúwhy did you spend so much money buying a new phone?‚Äù (I was baffled by then cuz hello, you ain‚Äôt got no phone to use girl...) and she said she might just use my iPhone 8plus instead because of the home button.\n\nFast forward today, she still hasn‚Äôt chosen which phone to use, but I already cleared the iPhone 8plus for her. I still told her to try the new phone out. Then in the middle of a conversation she told me she had though of selling the iphone8 plus to get a new phone for her mom... that‚Äôs when I kind of lost it...\n\nSometimes I just don‚Äôt know how to deal with her.
12	*1st*\n\nWatch Season 1 of The Newsroom.\n\nWe are introduced to the Therapist in episode 6 (Jack Habib) and we see him again in episode 8 and episode 9.  Well some of the time the INTJ character (Will) will not understand what the ENFP character (Mac) is doing, but the therapist does a good job of bridging the divide between the two.  Well your conversation is reminding me of things that happened in Episode 8 and 9 between Will and his therapist.  (Note Episode 10 does not include the therapist but it shows what happens when an INTJ gets in the GRIP.)\n\nWell in Episode 8 the therapist has a metaphor about Will the INTJ and the Candle and how the INTJ thinks he can play with a candle, he can master a candle and suddenly the candle will not hurt him.  When in reality what he needs to do is he needs to forgive the ENFP, not for the ENFP's sake, but instead for his sake.  He needs to forgive himself for life happens and sometimes life is painful.\n\nWell in Episode 9 Will and the Therapist meet again and the therapist said "You weren't part of the equation."  INTJ babbles and then he pauses and asks "How was I not part of the equation?"  The therapist explains  the dyanamic in simple terms.  The INTJ hears the therapist but does not connect the big insights until later, namely the end of episode 9, then again in episode 10 (Season Finale of Season 1), and then later in episode 19 (Season Finale in Season 2, aka the shredding paper conversation.)\n\nYes this is cryptic, it will not make sense, until you watch the show.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*2nd*\n\nYou are triggering the ENFP with her conflict over Si and Se.\n\nAnd she is triggering you the INTJ with your conflict over Se and Si.\n\nBoth of you suck at Sensing stuff, and you both suck at the different forms of Sensing both forms.  And how you get rid of this "conflict" inside of yourselve is different than how your partner gets rid of the conflict inside of herself, and ***RUSHING*** the conflict trying to get an ***ANSWER***, when one is still mulling over the ***QUESTIONS*** can really frustrate an INTJ and can really frustrate an ENFP.\n\nRoland00 / Matt goes cryptic again and borrows some wisdom from an INFJ in a form of another quote\n\n>Person 1: ‚ÄúWe in the Handdara don‚Äôt want answers. It‚Äôs hard to avoid them, but we try to.‚Äù\n\n>Person 2: ‚ÄúFaxe, I don‚Äôt think I understand.‚Äù\n\n>Person 1: ‚ÄúWell, we come here to the Fastnesses mostly to learn what questions not to ask.‚Äù\n\n>Person 2: ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre the Answerers!‚Äù\n\n>Person 1: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt see, Genry, why we perfected and practice Foretelling?‚Äù\n\n>Person 2: ‚ÄúNo‚Äî‚Äù\n\n>Person 1: *‚ÄúTo exhibit the perfect uselessness of knowing the answer* ***to the wrong question.‚Äù***\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*3rd*\n\nLets now pivot back to the main topic and point out things I KNOW for sure.\n\n* Your ENFP is a clutz.\n\n* Your ENFP feels guilty about being a clutz.\n\n* Your ENFP, like most ENFPs in general but she shown the signs in the conversation you wrote down here.  *She feels super guilty, super sensitive about hurting people.*\n\n* Your ENFP also feels super sensitive in a form of *inferiority complex* about being a clutz and always making mistakes and how these mistakes have concrete consequences that can lose money, can damage relationships, can give up opportunities in the moment due you now having to dedicate time to fix the problem caused by the mistake.\n\n* Your ENFP because of her inferiority complex needs to have a "return to mastery" and until that return of mastery occurs she will be super sensitive and will sometimes push people away by accident for she can't be in this unbearable / dysphroic (too hard to bear) state.\n\n* How do ENFPs return to mastery?  They return to mastery via Si and figuring out habits, rotuines, etc which will minmize harm in the future.  An ENFP can't handle too much Se for ENFPs value Si more than Se and when they make a mistake they need to figure out a habit or routine to no make that mistake again in the future and that is what Si is for, with a person with an inferior Sensing attribute, and that inferior Sensing is Si.\n\n* INTJs are different, I will not explain how for you already know and I am trying to be brief.\n\n* **TRUST ME** but the ENFP in your life sees your concern, and she sees that you are trying to solve problems and give her opportunities in the present and future and you are trying to forgive her mistakes in the past.\n\n* But to an person with an inferiority complex who is still feeling inferior and still has not had a return to mastery, this is like rubbing salt in the wound.  Ironically you are trying not to rub salt in the wound but instead rubbing a balming / endorphin thing that will take away the pain, but you do not realize this is not a soothing cream it is an antiseptic cream that burns when you rub it in.\n\n* The ENFP needs time to figure out how to have habits that are proactive and will not hurt people and she will feel confident about.\n\n* Simultaneously during this attempt to return to mastery the ENFP is also solving problems that do not need solving.  Why is the ENFP doing that, for the pain is too intense of how she screwed up and thus she recruits trying to help others and she distracts herself with minor problems to feel less broken about the most recent immediate problem.  Maybe she can sell her phone that cost more money and downsize to cheaper phone for herself and also get a new phone for mom for that will be helping mom and she loves mom and by helping the people she loves she will feel better about herself for she feels really crappy about herself right now.  Aka this is buying people off.\n\n* Of course this is super triggering to you for you are in a co-dependent state for you are trying to forgive but you are not there yet with actual forgiveness, you need to understand what the ENFP is doing, you need to know as well (knowledge and understanding are two different things, acceptance can only occur when knowledge and understanding are unified followed by you wanting to move on and wanting to accept.)\n\n* You "bought off your ENFP" and incrued a debt to show her that you love her, she sees this action but she is not sure this is the wisest action right now due to her clutzyness.  Right now she wants the love but not the "symbols of love" such as you buying her off for you are trying to make her life easier and in the process made her life more complicated.\n\nBLAH BLAH BLAH I suck at explaining this^(God damn I hate being ADHD and Dyslexic for it causes me to ramble with stories and it is hard to come to the point) but I think I created enough information that you can see the patterns now and I will let you come to your own understanding.  If you have more questions ***please ask them.*** üòä\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSidenote these are not related but also related\n\nhttps://parralmf.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/5-love-langauages.jpg *Figure this out sometime in a week after this fight has blown over, do not try to use this right now.*  All humans have preferences to these 5 things where some are more useful, more conscientious, than others depending on our own cognition.  Aka we crave the things we can not self supply ourselves so figure out which ones you can provide yourself and which ones you appreciate others participating in with you, aka which ones you want to see from your loved ones, to help you, to help yourself.\n\nhttps://i.pinimg.com/originals/f6/93/30/f693309e9b349fa165d6b14deab7d641.jpg Sometimes people try to help, out of romance, and not understanding they are not helping.
3	Remember that there are healthy ENFPs and unhealthy ENFPs. Most people are not emotionally maturing as expected due to this technology age. It is very frustrating. 
2	Jesus, that sounds like a shitstorm happening. I‚Äôm not an ENFP but still I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a very healthy relationship you have. I know that I am, however in no place to say that considering my own problems in my relationship. But I don‚Äôt think this is even a problem related to ENFPs at all, you guys need to sit down and have a talk! \n\nWhat she did seems pretty unreasonable and you have every right to be upset.

2	What do you do when you‚Äôre having an anxiety attack?	I know we all post a lot of anxiety but I had a pretty bad anxiety attack last night simply from overthinking and my head flooding with negative thought after negative thought. I took some stuff to knock me out so I can sleep for work tonight and woke up a few hours later short of breath and chest tightness. I wake up anxious a lot but normally it goes away. I can‚Äôt shake this. I took something to help with anxiety but it‚Äôs not working. I can‚Äôt calm myself down and need suggestions on what works best for y‚Äôall.. please help 
2	I‚Äôm so, so, so sorry that you‚Äôre feeling this way! I haven‚Äôt had an anxiety attack in years but I had one last weekend while visiting my ex fianc√© and it was NUTS. Short of breath, crying, threw up three times, the whole nine yards.\n\nFirst of all, please be careful with what you take to knock you out. It seems easier to quiet the noise but we are generally empaths and can feel more than the average bear. Whenever I take diphenhydramine (Advil PM, Benadryl, etc.) it gives me the most INSANE nightmares. \n\nI wish I had a one-size-fits-all method about your anxiety attacks, but I remember how I felt on the bathroom floor last week and the only thing I could do was breathe and tell myself it would be okay.\n\nIt sounds easier than it is, but we‚Äôre the ones letting our minds wander and thus creating our own anxiety. I was able to take deep breaths (box breathing is effective if you‚Äôve ever tried that) and tell myself that this too shall pass. \n\nSomething that also helps me is thinking- will this matter in 5 years? What about in 10 years? \n\nYou have to get your mind out of the rut it‚Äôs in and only you can do that. Affirmations help me too. Just remember: you are loved, you are beautiful, you are enough. \n\nAngels are always with you. Ever notice the clock at a certain time, over and over (for me it‚Äôs 12:34) or random change somewhere? You are loved and protected and you will be just fine in time, I promise!\n\nI‚Äôm here if you ever need anything. Xx
1	Well I went to the hospital right before Christmas thinking I was having a heart attack. My left arm had been feeling weird and slightly numb and tingly for a few hours but I played it off. I then started feeling really sick and a little dizzy and just like "Something is wrong." I immediately jumped up and said "I don't feel good!" to my parents and tried to explain the situation. They were skeptical but we went to the emergency room. I could bare;ly get dressed in regular clothes (I was in pajamas) or tie my shoes. My whole body was weak and shaky.\n\nAt the hospital they brought me right in. But I told them I suffer from anxiety a lot. They checked my blood pressure, etc. and I guess didn't think anything was wrong. Sent me to another room where I waited for doctor. He asked stuff and sent me for a shoulder x-ray. As I waited for that honestly I felt fine again. Knowing it was most likely an anxiety attack made it go away I guess. I waited a while because they accidentally brought this old man on a stretcher in to the shoulder x-ray instead of me. I thought that's what was happening but wasn't sure but then they brought him back and said it was a mix-up and got me. X-ray showed nothing.\n\nAfter I kind of felt embarrassed. I don't know why. I did feel like a heart attack or something. But it still feels pathetic or whatever.\n\nBut I have had panic attacks before too and a few since then. Chest tightness is often just that, chest tightness. Not heart tightness, your chest. The muscles. Or your back muscles being tight that pulls on your chest and feels similar. It can get so tight it hurts I know. And breathing during a panic attack feels weird because you're focusing so much on it, actively controlling it instead of being natural.\n\nThis is the best thing I've ever found and has really helped me in panic attacks now: https://www.anxietycoach.com/overcoming-panic-attacks.html It is a 5 step approach that really works and calms down and let's the panic pass through you and leave. You can also do breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth, slowly. This activates your parasympathetic nervous system which starts to calm you down.\n\nI hope you feel better. Remember it's not  danger it's discomfort. And it will end. They always end. This will too.
1	You are so welcome!! Like I said I‚Äôm always here (:
76	‚ÄúThe things you perceive to be your weaknesses will end up being your greatest strengths‚Äù	
17	People mock me for over thinking (in a playful way). The thing isnt the mocking it's that they interrupt and break my line of thought. If im thinking or processing something, or even when im opening up about something i enjoy i get shutdown.\n\nI cant avoid it\nOverthinking has gotten me further than others, it makes me improve faster\nIf you dont like it, get away from me. I am who i am.
7	Beware.\n\nOverthinking has landed me in self isolation. I've become hyper aware, and it's chased me from society. I can read people, sense the changing of their emotions, and see their judgement.\n\nI beg you, please try to remember to remain aloof on some things. Fight the urge to dissect and study how people act, how they think, and above all, ignore the need to know what they're going through.\n\nDon't do what I did, and go full chameleon. You learn far too much about people, and end up seeing how heartless they are when you can't match their empty souls. You'll end up being disgusted by the majority of people, and uncomfortable in the presence of your fellow righteous ones due to how harshly you'll see the world.\n\nBe aloof. Please.
4	Thanks. I need to remember this. 
3	Is it possible to have a emotional boner? I think it is <3   \n\n\nAny tips on how to show this to those you love who are struggling accept and like themselves?

2	What about anxiety 
187	I know my enfpeeps will understand! I have a coworker who truly enjoys making others miserable. She was off for 3mo and now that she is back it appears that I am her favorite target. A different coworker had these waiting for me yesterday. It made me cry. A strong reminder that it‚Äôs her and not me!	
37	Report her ass & have others do the same. It's not worth letting someone ruin your vibes because you know it'll weigh on your mind and you'll take that stress home with you every day. 
31	A little more about the situation. \nThis 30yr old woman has been with the company for 10 years. This gives her an unmerited superiority complex. She herself admits that she has run other employees off that she doesn‚Äôt like. I am an expert in my field but have only been with the company for two years. She doesn‚Äôt respect my position nor talents. (For the record; she is a sales person and I am the tailor and I make it possible for her customers to receive a finished product). I refuse to give into her pettiness. This annoys her. \nI admit, she did manage to get me to a pretty low point in my thinking in just the ONE week that she has been back. I started to believe it might be my fault and that I‚Äôm not as well liked as I had thought. I think everyone else at work saw how her behavior was affecting me and they have been super nice to me this week. But the gesture of the coworker who bought me the coffee confirmed to me that she is the problem and I have done nothing to warrant such behavior from her. \nI am not going to let her drive me off and my mantra is; if she is targeting me, then she is leaving someone else alone. I am loved and supported. I can handle this! \n\nThanks for the support, Friends!!
39	I have found that bullies like meek people as targets. Consider pushing back. This doesn‚Äôt need to mean being confrontational or mean. You can very calmly point out how she is behaving and how it makes you feel. Or make statements like, ‚ÄúThat is an overreaction.‚Äù She won‚Äôt like being called out and will likely move on to someone else. 
9	Yes you are! Toxic co-workers are sometimes just frustrated with others who seem to live with ease at work. They lash out only due to their own shortcomings. \n\nI just let my work speak for itself and stayed out of the drama. I also developed a good relationship with my boss so no one could deceive him about my character while I was not around. Karma usually catches up with these people in life so, I don‚Äôt sweat it too much. \n\nAlso, ‚ÄòAn Honest Meditation‚Äô by Jason Headly on youtube helped at work when I was feeling the negativity! Haha\n\nHang in there!
14	That looks so good, that‚Äôs nice another coworker has your back! Maybe let a manager/ HR know about the other coworker, it can be detrimental to a work environment and no one deserves that
3	Girl you are loved! You gotta stand up for yourself because she picks on you since you're sweet. This happens to me too, whenever someone picks on me though I just clap back. 
3	Be your own advocate! Being assertive and standing up for yourself is SELF LOVE. Don‚Äôt put up with shit you don‚Äôt deserve. 
2	It stinks when people act so meanly. Nice that others aren't so bad to you.
2	You know when i was still employed at a bank , this officer of mine was very unapproachable to me and so were the others. I wasnt welcomed at work and i missed my train mates.Lemme tell you that my first job wasnt that great.\n\nThe service officer was so rude. I was a bank teller so i would help others carry cash notes and bring it to the first floor. Worst i could be forgetful but i would also ask others and review my training notes. One time she talked to me and asked me questions about teller transaction. I answered half of the questions correct and i answered the wrong or somehow  close to the truth. She then lashed out and told me that i was arrogant. I was surprised by her rude and unprofessional manner. \n\nThe following day she approached me and she told me that she hates arrogant know it all ( referring to me who else) . She said that she wouldnt bother to promote me. Like wtf was that.\n\nI hated being a teller ( not because of her) and the following i reported her ass to hr along with this coworker who sucks up to her. Until now i still dont have updates about my complaint.\n\nReport her to your hr. She might lash out soon but stand on your ground and dont be afraid to speak your mind. It may be hard at first but no one gives a shit about her\n\n
2	Why do these people exist?! I hate them they are like moths to the ENFP‚Äôs flame.  With the help of my therapist, I got through my last work bully quicker than I EVER had before and I‚Äôll share with you how I did it.\n\nI noticed another coworker trying to stand up for me when she was being rude to me after I made an honest mistake. He‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs her first week, Be nice.‚Äù\n\nAnd I told her, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need you to be nice to me. I understand that how you talk to me is not about me‚Äî and I don‚Äôt care.‚Äù \n\nNext time she snapped on me I just said ‚ÄúOK, Karen.‚Äù In a firm voice and made eye contact. This deterred her from doing that again. \n\nFor some reason it just took this little acknowledgement of the situation. She opened up about how she took her role seriously and didn‚Äôt want me stepping on her toes because she could handle it herself. The gist of it was that she wanted to show me she‚Äôs good at her job by barking orders at me. LOL I found this so funny. I did not need to own that little insecure moment she was having.\n\nThen I just had to be assertive from there on, I asked her for help when I needed it, and I started saying hi to her in a neutral tone and using her name. Just like I had that other time. she started talking to me more and more and now we have a working work relationship! I‚Äôm shocked at how easy it ended up being. \n\nTLDR: Those people suck. Firmly saying, ‚ÄúOK, (the persons name)‚Äù without backing down worked for me. They‚Äôre like animals who can smell fear or passivity. Lol\n\n

3	Not really, because I know they have lives outside of texting, and also some things aren't meant to be responded to

1	Just a quick question	TLDR; High school stories thread.\n\nHi fellow ENFP's! My mind wandering all over the place, and a thought came upon me...\nAnyway, I just wanted to ask you people: how was highschool for you? What's the thing you remember the best or what are you the most proud of?\n
2	I always say high school was my most important period of time.\n\nThere was a lot to say the least. Most impactful was sophomore year when my cat had to be put down. Damn near broke me in May and came even closer in June, going so far as to contemplating suicide. I changed from a happy-go-lucky kid to excessively down-to-earth and cynical.\n\nMy fondest memories of my high school years were thanks to a friend I met the same June as mentioned before. In a sense, you could say she was the first step into the world of romance. As much as I know we were never going to be a thing, its possible I did like her for a small time. She also helped me get out of that cynicism. And I needed it.\n\nBest decision I ever made, however, came a month after this friend and I parted ways (summer between junior and senior year)\n\nI chose to reach out to someone in a discord server owned by a friend of my bestfriend from high school. That person became something special: the bridge I needed to cross into the love world. None of that came to fruition in high school, but instead freshman year of college.\n\nShe and I can't make it work for now, but we're staying close and have already cemented a friendship forever. And if it ends up we're both ready to try again someday, then thats what happens.
2	I just loved the breadth of things I took part in. I did track, drama, band, some choir stuff through church, leadership (doing pep assemblies, planning a parade, being the mascot a time or two, and just going and cheering on the teams), and just general ridiculousness. \n\nOne of my favorite memories was winning sophomore homecoming prince. I was nominated as a sort-of prank by some "cool kids" who were trying to embarrass me, thinking it would be funny if I got nominated. They didn't get the last laugh though because I won and the princess became one of my best friends and we got to ride in a convertible and sing along to the Lion King soundtrack (the Homecoming theme that year was Disney and Lion King was our grade's assigned movie). Plus I got a cool sceptre. 
2	enfp, in your career life, what are ur weakness and biggest obstacles that caused from your personality	I'm just 25F and want to start up my own illustration/ design brand in near future, but I graduated last September and started my first full time job last October , so still pretty inexperienced about so many rules or steps or complete thoughts about company etc.  and so far, I feel like there are so so so many things I need to improve to be perfect, so I'm a bit worried if its a bad decision to start something on my own when I'm not very experienced. however, I also believe learning while doing, and I can never feel " ready" until I start to do it.\n\n(Im not worried about my art skills , an probably creativities and art are the only things I'm 100% sure I can handle it well) (else, like finance or management , especially remembering little detailssssss and stepsssssss, Im a bit worried about it. )\n\nid like to know what are your weakness and how do you fix it? thanks
3	I always want to be trying something new, so I struggle with sticking to one thing and following through with it. Makes it almost impossible to finish essays and lab-reports on time.
2	Continuous detailed task. Like keeping book about something. \n\nI'm a teacher (in germany so that might be different in the us) and i have to keep my own grade books and student records (for some things). Its a pain in the ass!\n\nOh and deadlines!
1	Well it's easy. You'll never be perfect. No one is. But that being said I get where you're coming from. I want to write and write songs and do lots of creative things but I never do. Because I know I'm not that great yet and I don't want to waste my good ideas on subpar performance. It's frustrating. I know if I just start I can fix it and work on it as I go but I can't get myself to start.

2	Relationships and hygiene	So. Idk what I'm doing. I broke up a few months ago with a girl (enfp) who left for college. By the time we broke up she was definitely ready, but she just could never say it so I had to be the one. Which was hard cause I really liked her. She felt more like a best friend than a girlfriend. That I also got to make out and do stuff with. Looking back tho she lied about some things and it was a pretty toxic relationship, but she did a lot of things I really liked. \n\nShe wore hella perfume. She'd leave my car smelling like flowers for days after she was in it and I LOVED IT. She never had bad breath, (except like once) and she would wear different flavored lip balms which made kissing just that much better. She had just really good (actually like super good) hygiene.\n\nWell time moves on, I am now dating this other girl (infp) and well like idk. Shes more emotionally attached than I am. And her hygiene well it's not bad, it's just normal. It's like hit or miss on the breath thing ngl, like it's never too bad, nothing horrible, but I'd rather make out with minty fresh breath rather than just meh breath.\n\n Like it's understandable. We usually only see each other at the end of our days, and she works fast food so like i kinda get it... But like when we go to kiss and I see plaque or whatever that stuff is between her teeth... Oh fuck dude I close my eyes and never open them again. Keep tongue to a minimal. And like she never smells bad. Like she just smells normal. And I told her before I love it when girls wear hella perfume but I don't think she got the message, and I mean I can't change a person.\n\nLike I don't know how to bring the mouth stuff up. How do you tell someone you want them to brush their teeth more. That you'd like it if they sprayed some perfume. I try my best, I brush my teeth again if I know I'm going to be seeing her, have Altoids, spray cologne, make sure ive got a lil extra deodorant... I just don't get it. Like she's an amazing girl and emotionally great for me, but idk those are some thing that I really want in someone I am going to have a steady relationship with.\n\nAm I the fucked up one here? Is it wrong for me to ask that of her? To take a bit better care of herself? Like I said ik you can't change a person... but like I just never been in the situation where someone I'm kissing doesn't have that good of hygiene maintenance.\n\nAlso the reason I'm asking on r/ENFP is because I've found that this is where I usually get the best relationship advice from like minded people
2	Hahahaha yo this is good stuff. I'm not an enfp and sorry for laughing but there's no support group or anything for guys who have met this problem (which we all have at some point). I honestly have no idea man, unless she feels a need to up her professional game, it probably won't get better. I guess you can make sure you always have some gum or mints whenever you see her? Good luck, and let us know how it goes? Probably a somewhat common problem with not enough answers.
2	Oh, just laughed cause I am ENFP girl who likes EVERYTHING to smell nice and super clean and well-maintained, and one of the worst things that happened to me (2 years passed, still hurts) was when my HOUSE pipes started to smell ocassionally on cold days (and I was SO concious about it! Whole system had to be changed, I tried and spent so much hours cleanin: it could not be solved completly until I put a fortune to change all of them). One of my best friends jokingly commented on it "like euuu, your bathroom smells terrible, guuurl", I made a joke about how I desperatly I want to meet the Plumber of my dreams ... and cried whole night embarassed as fuck xDD Needless to say, I am still concious inviting her to my place. And if I do, I make sure IT IS DAMN PERFECT. But no spontanious invites -- hey, wanna hang out at my place? -- nope, too traumatising!\n\nIt is sensitive as fuck! (And it was not even me smelling!)\n\nAnd if you bring the topic with human being about the smell, shit, they will probably be ok on words but deep inside they will be super hurt and bleeding. And guess who they will hate? And you know that it should be normal topic to discuss. Like we all humans and everything. But... But. You cannot be sweet about it, no matter how good or well you try! Nope! You can make someone else try to do the work for you, so it is not YOU who they will hate, make sure it is not a person they appreciate a lot...\n\n(I know a person who took ages to overcome a co-worker (he would even avoid her and write emails instead going to the next office) who said something innocent as "maybe, possibly, not to be offended, but maybe socks could be changed more often". Which he did everyday anyway. He would be concious to get sweaty, and have a changing pair of underwear\\socks at work, taking showers 2 times a day, and it was super traumatising experience and still is... But even before that he smelles normal to me. We shared a room and ... "nope, cannot smell anything, yes I do not mind smelling your armpit, no, it is FINE, god sake, relax!"\n\nBut Internet is like: oh, no worries, it is ok, they will be fine with it! It is for their own good!)\n\nDo it indirectly!\n\n1. Super-mint gum helps: try to make it as a "play" and exchange it between your mouths. Or drops, or candies, or whatever. Offer them to her all the time, become a sudden gum lover.  Put gum everywhere, car, home, garage, washing room. Well, pretend it is your addiction!\n2. Start making nice snacks for her, apples, fruits, good diet, broccoli, put a water bottle, try to be carying, not shaming!\n3. Do a small tokens of love. Put a gum in her bag with a note "cannot wait to be kissing you tonight!" or a drops "sweet and juicey as you", be creative and not only teeth related shit, some other things as well. Like chocolate bar ("like you to the mars and back"). But make it happen that health things are appearing more xDD\n4. Go and have healthy food together, experiment with tastes and herbs, etc.\n5. Buy yourself a nice electronic toothbrush and praise it, like how funny it is and how much more efficient and maybe mention that she might get interested in new technology of brushing teeth? Why not give it a try? It is awesome! Like how once you go electronic, you never go back! And how we waste so much normal brushes every month...And maybe it is worth the enviornment?\n6. Just be hygenic fuck yourself. Put flosses around you, balmb with smell (who said you cannot use them too, like  wanna taste my lips, have a surprise xD), etc. Try to make them notice how it is important for you. I bet they will but present it as that is just you. You know, freak. I bet they will be more cautious about themsleves.\n\nSo being said,\n\nbe careful, it brings lots of insecurities, do not do it obviously and at the same time, just casually, might be a thing a person is already aware themselves and do best they can..but cannot help it. And it might be just you who think their breath smell bad xDD
1	Dude that's totally normal, and I think it's not fucked up or rude, and you should tell her directly how you feel, but be very sweet about it, INFPs are very emotional and bad with criticism, you just compliment her between every sentence or something like that? Hahaha
1	Loooooooool this made me laugh omg 
64	Easy	
8	I find michael scott so relatable man. 
4	Literally an hour ago I was talking about this with a mutual
3	Hahahaha I've definitely thought some shit like this
15	INFP or ENFP?	I've nearly always tested as an INFP. I'm a guy. I feel things SO MUCH, I cry during movies, I cry from motivational stories, things like that. Love is pretty much the most important thing in my life and I pretty much shower the people I care about with love, affection, hugs and gifts. I love very few people though...I have three real friends I talk to...text them everyday...I could have more friends if I wanted to talk to more people and sometimes I want to have more friends but I have trouble making them. I pretty much never ignore a text from someone I care about, and always respond as soon as I notice it. INFPs have a habit of apparently ghosting people for 3 weeks, and I can't imagine ever doing that.\n\nI have no issues sharing my emotions, and often overshare. I simultaneously love and hate being the center of attention. Put me in a room full of 100 people and give me 10 seconds to talk, and I can probably have the whole room in stitches. But put me in a small group with people I know and I get overshadowed and awkward real quick. If I don't know the people, I'm not uncomfortable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm pretty impulsive. Never been good with money. Been told I act like I'm on drugs many times in my life. Always been the "weird one". I'd say I'm extremely intelligent book wise, but no common sense whatsoever...practical skills, I'm dumb as a sack of rocks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll pretty much flirt with anyone attractive I see, but the second I'm committed to someone, I'm committed and my loyalty is pretty much to the death. I usually end up choosing one person in my life who I would defend until my very last breath. People have attacked her (my best friend) on social media and I come in spitting flaming balls of truth at them until they shut the fuck up, sit the fuck down and think about the mistake they've made.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're nice to me for a second and you're attractive, I'm pretty much instantly into you. I have definitely gone up to random people I barely know and and asked them out because I thought they were attractive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have baby fever real bad and I want kids so freaking bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI always send hundreds of animal pics and memes because I just want to make the other person laugh or smile.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLove animals, spontaneous travel, and want to live in the middle of nowhere.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI truly believe I could fall in love with almost anyone as long as they're attractive. I also stick around in situations I should have left for my own sanity way longer than I should.\n\nI live vicariously through my memes and cute animal pics.\n\nI'm also UBER kinky.
10	This is something that is constantly posted in here. But I have heard ENFP's always wonder if they are INFP but INFP's never wonder if they are ENFP. We are the most introverted extrovert after all. But INFP is not the introverted version of extrovert. They have their cognitive functions in a different order and thus think differently. Also to Jung introvert just mean inward and deep and extrovert meant outward and wide. The I and E just means your top function is either directed outward or inward.\n\nIf you don't know about cognitive functions check this: https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/if-youre-confused-about-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-read-this-an-intro-to-cognitive-functions/\n\nThis site is the best cognitive function-based description I've seen: https://www.typeinmind.com/nefi/\n\nThe biggest difference between INFP and ENFP I have found after talking to an INFP guy a lot about this is because they lead with Introverted Feeling they need everything to be personal to them or connected to a value or feeling they have for them to find it important or worthwhile. Then they can run it through Extroverted Intuition to find different ways that thing could be within their feeling framework.\n\nENFP's on the other hand lead with Extroverted Intuition and thus can see all possibilities of things without limit. We don't judge first like INFP's, we perceive first. We see all patterns and connections freely, even if unrealistic. Then, if applicable we filter through Introverted Feeling to narrow it down decide how it applies to us.\n\nI tried doing an exercise with him where you take a spoon (or fork) and try to think of as many other things it could be used for besides for eating. I can name 50 at least with no sweat. A swimming pool for a fruit fly for instance. But he had trouble with it. So I framed it as he was on a desert island and only had a spoon, what could he use it for and then he was able to think of more things.\n\nSo which do you think sounds more like you? More free, open-minded, imagination driven and judge later? Or more authenticity, person value judgments driven and imagine after?\n\nYou can be an ENFP who is mostly alone and at home with no social life. That's what I am. And I had social anxiety disorder most of my life too. But I am ENFP because I lead with Ne. I perceive then judge. I never judge first.\n\nAlso one of the ENFP super powers is our ability to see things from every perspective, to walk in anyone's shoes naturally. We see all the possibilities then filter through Fi, thus we can imagine a situation and how we would feel in that situation. We can understand how someone got to think how they do, even if we adamantly agree. I am not sure INFP's can really do this or as well. They tend to judge first and then maybe try to see other perspectives with Ne but I think it is much harder for them to step out of their own feeling and views into someone else's head. After all they are all bout self-authenticity and hate ever feeling like they are stepping from themselves at all.
6	I sense strong Fi from you...\nBut it's clear you're Ne dom! Being spontaneous, flirting with a anyone, better with a large group of people, the idea of living in the middle of nowhere it's all highly Ne but since your Fi is nearly equally as well developed, you might be confused\nIf you wanna know for sure though, think of how your functions manifest when you're stressed. Do you hurt people, and try to control everything going around you and get shit done out if spite? (Te, proving you're INFP) or do you get self obsessed, hypochondriac, repulsive to new experiences, and exhibit OCD tendencies? (Si, proving you're ENFP) \nHope this helps! 
3	I feel almost exactly like you do! I've taken tests many times and always get XNFP with 60/40 E/I or the other way around, so I've decided to just believe that my personality fluctuates between an extrovertedness and introvertedness.\nPerhaps you're also both?
2	I feel a lot of what you're saying here myself tbh. Not really sure whether I'm an ENFP or INFP either, and maybe that's just how it is for both in a lot of situations? I've heard the same thing of INFPs hard ghosting people as well, which seems like something I'd never do. I've also heard that INFPs tend to know for sure that they're introverted while ENFPs tend to question whether they're introverted or extroverted (which is something I very strongly relate to).\nNot sure for you but I'd say you seem closer to ENFP from what I can tell, but I'd definitely take my own understanding with a grain of salt.\n\nHope you're able to figure out which of the two you are :D!
2	Research the 4 cognitive functions associated with enfp and infp, maybe it'll give you a better idea of which you are?\n\nOr it could be fluctuating because you're 50/50 I/E. Most people leak towards one but it isn't one or the other; we all have a bit of each. \n\nBtw I skimmed the post, I knew you were certainly NFP at the part of crying during movies. That's so me also. 
2	Enfp, wanna date? ;)
1	You need to read into the functional stack and figure out which one suits you more. \nINFP- Fi Ne Si Te\nENFP- Ne Fi Te Si\n\nTbh to me it sounds like you‚Äôre an ENFP only because I have an E friend who‚Äôs is just like this. But it‚Äôs up to you to decide which one is actually you. There are plenty of places that will detail the functional stack and how it works. 
1	sounds like you're an ENFP. I've heard before that usually infps are positive they're introverts and enfps will question whether they're introverted or extroverted.\n\nalso this is a list of stuff that mentions a few key differences:\n\n[https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/09/523471/](https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/09/523471/)
17	Is anyone else frustrated when others don't want to participate in your adventures?	Often when I have a, in my opinion, good idea for something to do (like a vacation, a new hobby etc) and others don't really come along I get really frustrated. Anyone else experience that? Do I need more Enfp friends?
4	Yes lol I have a lot of ideas and my bf and friends will always just shake their heads and go along with them when it‚Äôs clear they don‚Äôt actually care to make them happen
2	Yes! And sometimes I don‚Äôt even have people to ask to come along
2	YES, but I've also learned that people have lives and responsibilities. I try to take those things into account before I suggest an adventure and I have more success  of getting people to go along with things (but I would go on SO MANY more adventures if I had people who were down).\n\nAlso, sometimes I just go on the adventure myself and it's almost always still worth it. 
1	All the time!!\n
1	All the time!!\n
1	My bf is an ENTJ and he kills my vibe everytime with his thorough planning.. etc etc by the time he finish his speech I lost my drive already lmao! Find some INFPs omg they're amazing at adventuring with us! And INFJs! My best friend of almost 6 years is one, they are a perfect companion for us! We could literally go anywhere lol
10	Do y‚Äôall ever just send gibberish to your close friends? Or send things within an instant to whomever. Sometimes once I‚Äôve sent whatever it may be, I think to myself, ‚Äúdang, bold‚Äù and keep living my life	
3	Emotion	Idolization really sucks. I really want this girl but i might have friends zoned myself ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I‚Äôm in a sour mood now idk what I should do.  \n\n\n\nEdit: she said she needed a few days to herself so i guess imma just move on.... 
3	Tell her what you feel as fast as possible 
2	Tell her what you feel. And to not friend-zone yourself, don't friend-zone yourself. It's easy. If you want to be in a relationship with someone then make that clear. Don't pretend to be a fiend. Don't do everything for her to try to ingratiate yourself to her. Because then you are acting like her boyfriend before you are and thus why would she want to change that? She's getting a lot with no effort from her. You need to respect yourself. A relationship is a two-way street. You have to like and respect each other. If one of those things isn't true it won't happen and you should move on.\n\nOn the other hand if you were friends before and started liking her that is slightly different. But think of it like this, you see her as a relationship prospect now but she has no idea, she sees you as the friend you are.\n\nI had an analogy that it's like 2 robots that are connected to each other. They both have friend connections out, which are lower, yellow, with a square end. But then you turned your connector into a relationship connector, higher, red, with a round end. The 2 connections don't connect anymore and can't. You are not in a relationship but you are no longer friends either. After all it is unfair of her to want you to be just friends when you see her differently. Just as it is unfair of you to want her to be in a relationship when she sees you differently. If you continue, as friends or in a relationship, one of you will be unhappy. It's sad but that happens sometimes. You 2 will have to go your own ways.
2	Yeah, be direct with your feelings as you can. otherwise, move on.
3	ENFP NEEDS HELP! (especially if you are in a relationship with an INTJ)	Hello!\n\nI'm ENFP and if there is anyone else who is in a relationship with an INTJ, please help me! \n\nSo my fiance and I had a small disagreement (not even a legit argument) and now I'm getting the silent treatment. Its like the cold war all over again.\n\nNow firstly, this is NOT something I am used too. As an ENFP, I want to talk about why you feel upset (he hates it when I ask him if he's upset) and I want to talk it out and get to the root of the problem. Basically talk about how we are feeling etc. Which obviously, I guess INTJs don't like talking about how they feel?\n\nSo anyways, he's been reading my messages but not replying to ANYTHING. And its been like over 16 hours now?\n\nSo I've got some questions.\n\n1. Is this normal?\n\n2) If so, how long before the cold war ends?\n\n3) Can someone please explain to me what is going through an INTJ's head during the cold war because I'm feeling very anxious and over thinking and analysing all possible scenarios here (typical ENFP).\n\n4) Any tips for communication differences in INTJs and ENFPs?\n\nHope someone can help!!!
8	If he refused to discuss the problem like a mature adult and instead ignores you, there are major issues here and you guys may want to go to counseling. That's just my opinion but others could tell me I'm wrong.
2	It might have been small argument for you but much more harmful for him. He needs to process his feelings and or this has been an ongoing issue and he is evaluating everything (meaning your future together). I'm an INTJ and when my SO just isn't getting something that is important to me or minimizes something important to me then I can go silent to process it. Give him space and or don't evaluate his response, evaluate your response and position over the argument and see if it is something you want to stand by or you have room to compromise.
2	The thing is the disagreement might have seemed small to you but might have been something very important to them. But on the other hand the silent treatment is awful and juvenile. My girlfriend didn't talk or respond to me for over a week once and it was cruel and stupid.
1	If anything is better than an ENFP, it‚Äôs solitude. When ENFPs get overwhelmed you will want to process your emotions or something. We INTJs will shut everything and everybody out, get busy with something, and suddenly, the emotions will come and go.\n\nIf you had a fight with your INTJ, and they are not responding, they need the space to not suffocate. We will come back, and with some tools to make amends. Just, if something is troubling us, we will address it when our intuition tells us it‚Äôs the right time.
1	1. Kind of. It's my instinct to withdraw when issues like this come up, but I've learned to just say " Look, I need to get my thoughts together before we talk again, so I'm sure of what I'm saying and don't say something stupid or that I don't mean." I agree with the others here that it is lame and immature but at the same time, it's clearly having an effect (I.e. you want him, or to hear from him at least) I'm not saying that's what he's doing, but at the very least it's a side effect he wouldn't mind.\n2. Not horribly long I would imagine, no one likes turmoil and uncertainty for long. But the harder you keep trying, and keep messaging it may push him away, just chill and wait to hear from him. If he NEVER hits you back up(All of our greatest fears), is he really the guy you thought he was?\n3. Likely the same. I've never been in a crazy serious long term relationship but I can say I'd be a combo of over analyzing/thinking of the future(with and without you)/ trying to not think too much about everything. I know that sounds antithetical but that's how my brain works i guess. Since I know I'll overthink, I need time to process and let those "Rough Draft" thoughts come and go, then become more clear and fleshed out.\n4. Never dated an ENFP but would love to. Can't help you with this question. Although, the only thing I can confirm is that yes, we don't love talking about our feelings unwarranted. When I want to talk about my feelings, I generally make the first move. If someone asks me first about how I feel, I've found I'm usually fine and it's really just how THEY feel about my feelings :l 
71	Are you an enfp?	
17	Repost from like 12 hrs ago 
7	11- if you repost the same thing over and over again! \n
3	10, I married 10.\n\nMade it work and now it's not stupid anymore.
3	I'm an INFP and these all apply to me 
3	All but number 2 and 3. Well, kinda with number 2. I do talk to myself out loud, but not because my head's "too full." It's because it's like an entirely separate train of thought, and I can use it to divert processing power to more resource-hogging problems.
3	I think that many non ENFPs can relate, too. So I think it's to narrow.
4	How can you be mad at someone genuinely criticizing you?\nI am posting this, because it actually makes me really mad, that there are people who really think it's a proper reaction to critism to get mad. If you messed up you can get criticized for it. And people have the right to call you out for this. Furthermore critsim is an opportunity to grow.\nI am living with 2 ENFP's and I hate it, when they get mad at me for telling them to clean their messes, because they rarely do anything and leave it up to me.
1	Lol, did someone post this already?
1	Every single one except talking to self.  But yup.. pretty much a perfect description. 
1	Eeee gads! 10 out of 10
1	Now THIS  is accurate
1	Oh haha, I just shared this from my Instagram!
3	How do yall deal with confrontation?	I'm so bad at dealing with being confronted. I cant stand when people act like their bigger or more important than the person they're talking to. And sadly that's how a lot of people choose to speak to me, so I need to toughen up. Any advice?
7	It has helped me to learn how to project a very authoritative energy and set boundaries like a MF. Take control of the situation even if you have to make something up: ‚ÄúEXCUSE ME, I am right in the middle of something so I will have to get back to you on this. Thanks.‚Äù  OWN your power. 
5	As you get older you develop your Extroverted Thinking which will allow you to be more assertive and action-oriented. But you can help develop it too, plus your Fi which comes into play.\n\nDevelop Fi by making more choices. Never be indecisive or say "whatever" or "I don't care" or "you choose." Feel deep down what you feel on something. Even if you like one option a tiny millimeter more choose it. The more you do this the more you will get in touch with what you really want and who you really are and you will be able to narrow your options down. You'll be able to determine which possibilities you like better, even if it's a tiny bit. And you will know who you are and what you stand for which will help you to stand up for them and not back down.\n\nTo develop your Te you should set little goals and try to achieve them. Tiny things. And even reward yourself for them. Get yourself into the mindset of doing things and finishing things to bring success and more things to do. Set bigger goals, then bigger. But keep small goals too. Big goals are made of smaller ones.\n\nYou can also try doing puzzles and other things to practice organization and efficiency. Clean and organize your closet, your room, your house/apartment. Find the best way for things to fit for the space. Find the best way things can go, the fastest, most efficient way.\n\nDoing these will develop your Te which will allow you to be more decisive and action-oriented as well. To be able to put ideas into practice. Doing this will make you more dynamic and about action. Coupled with Fi knowing who you are it will allow you to follow things you believe in and to stand up for them when confronted. After all these are things you believe in so you won't back down. And you know how to get things done so you know how to argue and how to achieve what you want.\n\nOther things to consider are that if anyone says anything bad about you, calls you a name, etc. you can take it objectively. Either they are right in which case they are telling the truth and it is just something you can take in and learn from and grow from. Or they are wrong and telling a lie in which case you can ignore it. I personally am fine with criticism and welcome it. If you don't know what's wrong how can you grow and change it?\n\nAnd lastly it is a self-esteem thing too. I understand as I have struggled with self-esteem issues for a long time. I felt others were better than me, more worthwhile. But you have to learn to love yourself and respect yourself. And understand that matter what anyone says they can never reach the strong, pure core of you.\n\n
1	Motivational Monday!	\nToday is a new day! A fresh week! An opportunity start something new and get back into life. \n\nWhat inspires you, /r/ENFP?\n\nPost stories, quotes, and images that give you life. Need a little rally? Don't be shy posting your goals; let /r/ENFP give you a pep talk!\n

2	Any ENFPs with BPD or CPTSD? How has it changed you?	Hello, I am a fellow ENFP with Borderline Personality Disorder and Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I think it gets in the way of my expressing my ENFP self---which is social, loving, open-minded, trusting, etc.\n\nI haven't felt like myself in a long time especially after I uncovered family trauma I went through. I am struggling and I want me back. The silly, loving, social me back. Anyone relate?
1	>I haven't felt like myself in a long time especially after I uncovered family trauma I went through. I am struggling and I want me back. The silly, loving, social me back. Anyone relate? \n\nI don't want to put myself into any personality bucket, but the fact is from the #10yearschallenge and #20yearschallenge. I found myself is "essentially" an ENFP. You know what? #10yc and #20yc is actually a gateway to access Si, but I think the consisting family issue can trigger Si from nowhere and anytime anywhere.\n\nTrauma hit me again some years ago, the root of trauma even backtraceable to early childhood like around 25-years ago, since then anything can take me for a ride (the virtual world things, but IRL I've never engaged in sex, smoking and alcoholism) took me away, I thought it was Se doing it's job making me such "histrionic". It's Ne thinking of I SHOULD go anywhere do anything and Te just keep pushing learning more how to dive into them, MBTI is one of the things I literally using Ne-Te to buiid up interest then being critical/cynical.\n\nThe function I found missing afterall is Fi, I don't even try to evaluate how my moral compass looked like, becuase it's assaulting other's value and I don't want mine being assaulted either. I know its effect because when I accessed it after several and consisting breakdowns it's very emotional, but it's really me and I'm quite relieved, realising my feelings towards the virtual world is actually stimulating my subconscious. \n\nMaybe I'm not saying anything, but addressing what was happened inside is really important, what was happened outside is happened and live just went on, but things inside is actually yours and controllable, even you found yourself suffering from OCD, HPD, DID, PTSD etc. .
1	https://youtu.be/UE5fZaAzXws I was involved with an ENFP who wasn't totally NPD, BPD but Dr.  Gannon explains in the video around 14 min. About PTSD, this explains my ENFPs behavior to a large degree. 
1	MBTI Discord	
4	The ENFP Survival Guide	I know I have problems, and I want to fix them. Is this a good book that helps unhealthy ENFPs become healthy? Or, shows them the right path to become healthy?
3	It's a light read with plenty of insights for different areas of our lives. I can send you over my unfinished summary if you'd like to glance over it before diving into the actual book. :)
2	Honestly if you want to work on your weaknesses you have to identify the areas in yourself that are week. Naturally some areas in all ENFP‚Äôs are equally weak but you have to identify them yourself and take steps to improve in the area particularly. For example we often explode with emotion but if you can learn to channel the explosion it creates amazing results in personal growth. I am trying to channel my emotional energy through breathing and meditation I have apps like the Calm app and Headspace that are good tool to help with the meditation and breathing.

5	Infp but all 10 points I relate.
3	A bit TOO MUCH!!!!!
3	Omggg this is so true! Especially the drugs part ahahaha. 
3	This is basically me in 10 points LOL
3	Im great at snap decisions, isnt that why we're intuitive feelers? but the rest is spot on.
2	i wish i was like you guys though
2	ENTP, most of that applies to us (or atleast me, too), especially the first one hahahah
2	This is crazy accurate
2	YAASSS!! YES YES YES FOR THD MOST PART
2	#4 always gets me in trouble.
2	What's number 9 doing there? I LOVE doing snap decisions 
2	Number one hahaha. I still remember the first house party i ever went to, I was 14 and and didn't know anyone there so I was scared to have any alcohol. Cut to an hour later, I'm lying across the laps of 5 people on a sofa, talking their ears off, as they tell me that i am "the drunkest sober person we've ever met."
1	I can relate to almost everything except to number one. I'm a little hyper from time to time to the point it gets on other peoples nerves tho... \n\n
1	Lol basically all of this xD i dont feel as much the insightful one, 4 and 5 hit me deep. Though having graduated college and not having a stable job I do miss the ‚Äújust do x y z‚Äù type assignments. But the next day I‚Äôll get annoyed if you tell me what to do. Hmm
1	But I'm always on drugs tho. :P
1	Feeling very seen
1	Omgah yess.
1	Why are all 10 me.... I hate feeling this called out
1	Oh my goodness I never realised other ENFPs related to #1, I legitimately had my chemistry teacher ask me if I was "on something" in the lesson. I was in sixth form college, he was a strange one.
1	I wish I was more like this but then again I don't want to be like this. But I'm really really attracted to people like this. It's weird. 
1	OMG you had me at #1 ROFL.
1	all of these. i am All Of These Things. üòÇ
1	Oh! Lol
1	(Safely) Try some drugs we love them! 
1	Number 8 all day long.
10	Anyone act like an unhealthy ISTJ when stressed?!	They say when ENFP's are under stress they act like unhealthy ISTJs. Well, I am under a lot of stress right now and have noticed that I do not act like my ENFP self so I decided to take the myers brigg test again and I tested as an ISTJ! It is exactly what some articles said online about ENFP's acting like ISTJs under their grip function!!\n\nI feel like a different person, but this effectiveness and assertiveness is very helpful right now as I work with a lawyer to get help with my terrible apartment situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone else notice they do this?!
4	Do not mislead yourself! If you do not feel like yourself YOU WON'T MAKE GOOD DECISIONS!\n\nBetter prioritize feeling well, and then doing any life impacting activities such as lawyers and apartment decisions. üòâ\n\nMy opposite is the ISFP. I definitely don't want to do anything important while in that state of mind. üòÇ
3	Based on past test results, I‚Äôm pretty sure when stressed/anxious/depressed, I tend to come across as more of an INFJ, sometimes INFP.
2	Ahhh I‚Äôve been feeling like this as well especially with midterms coming up. Gyming helps but only temporarily. Idk how to deal with this :( 
2	ENFPs commonly type as enneagram 7s. The enneagram discusses how a person can take on traits of another type with their are in stress or when they are growing. In stress, a type 7 goes to a type 1 (which is the perfectionist and a lot of ISTJs are type 1s). I think in mbti they also refer to this as when your type is in ‚Äúthe grip‚Äù and stressed how ENFPs react. 
2	Yes, when I was severely depressed in college, I tested a few times as ISTJ
1	I do MBTI 50+ times, ENFP with all stats over 80,
1	This is the book that pioneered the concept of calling the GRIP the GRIP.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Was-That-Really-Me-Personality/dp/0891061703\n\nExcept the author was talking about the GRIP in previous pamphlets, MBTI lectures, etc such as this 30 page book which preceded the first book link I gave you by 7 years.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0891060979/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i5\n\nWhenever you see these images such as this one.\n\nhttps://66.media.tumblr.com/434367edbc96d1bfb5ecb78c32e7db6e/tumblr_inline_p7gsxmmTV21rd2k9w_500.png\n\nThose pictures come from the 2nd book link.  (And the 2nd book is really just "pamphlets" you would give out to someone at a conference while you explain the main things.  Naomi works for / publishes things for the official MBTI organization where you can pay $200 dollars for the MBTI step II results, except Was that Really Me occurred prior to MBTI step II.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***TLDR I am blathering when the point of this is saying get that book I recommend above in the first link, the 2nd link is an older book but it is not as good as the 1st link which greatly expands and elaborates the concept.***
9	Enfp‚Äôs will anxiety/depression	So I‚Äôve been wondering for a while what is the cause in the change in myself. I don‚Äôt like to throw words like anxiety and depression lightly so I‚Äôve researching and I don‚Äôt think I have either.\n\nBut I don‚Äôt know what I can do to explain this change in myself. \n\nRight now I am at a party where I have locked myself in the bathroom because the party is too loud. I feel like a ghost in the room watching everyone rather then actually being at the party. And I realized that‚Äôs how I feel like a lot. However, whenever I am around people at my uni and hanging out I feel kind of normal. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm hiding how I feel but when I am around others it somehow changes my mood.\n\nIm usually known as the life of the party and the girl that cracks jokes and outgoing. The typical ENFP.\n\nBut now I feel more calm and I instead of constantly wanting to hang out of people I would rather be by myself. The other day, for example, I just went to read a book in a parking lot over looking the ocean; it was the most fun I‚Äôve had in a while. \n\nI don‚Äôt know what I hope to gain from posting this. Maybe someone relates? 
8	40-year-old ENFP here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have learned to embrace and love the times that I need to be alone to process the emotions and connections that I created while I was extroverted.  Just go with the emotional flow.  Remember please, that just because you are experiencing overwhelming emotion, does not necessarily mean that you are depressed, sad, in love or feeling anything permanent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMuch Love,\n\nMe\n\n. 
6	I have depression/anxiety and do relate.\n\nI suggest on the days you feel calm and want to be by yourself you do that. It's your body or your mind telling you I need some time to rest and recouperate. A really important part of ENFP is having rest time. We especially like to use our down time to think about our feelings, think about are values and kind of process all the information we've been taking in. If you have been having a stressed, busy, or just taking in a lot of new information lately you will probably want to have extra relaxing time.\n\nFor me getting into the new semester feels like taking off on an airplane. The first week is smooth - that's where you're taxiing on the runway. But the second week getting hit with the barrage of assignments is like the wheels leaving the ground and everything just accelerates super fast. I need more anxiety meds, and a lot more alone time. I have only seen my best friend and my boyfriend during my free time. I love people but I know if I was around them I would feel just as tired or I would feel like I should try to have fun when really I just wanna lie down!
5	> Right now I am at a party where I have locked myself in the bathroom because the party is too loud. I feel like a ghost in the room watching everyone rather then actually being at the party. And I realized that‚Äôs how I feel like a lot. However, whenever I am around people at my uni and hanging out I feel kind of normal. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm hiding how I feel but when I am around others it somehow changes my mood.\n\n\nI know this!!! I've totally been there before. \n\nOh, don't worry. There's nothing "wrong" with you. Part of being an ENFP is having recharge time for "Fi" cognitive function. \n\nYou need genuine, proactive rest in life. Sit and lay on the couch and DO NOTHING. Including no reddit, no browsing, no phone, no TV, just sit and process your emotions. You don't have to necessarily meditate, but that helps too. \n\nI also love to do yoga, been doing it almost every day now I can. It helps me emotionally. \n\nFinally how are you doing emotionally? Are you feeling a lot? That's okay, and you need alone time to process that. ENFP is the "most introverted extrovert" because we suddenly need alone time. \n\nReading "the ENFP survival guide" has helped me and may help you understand yourself as well (it's oddly accurate!). \n\nSo yeah I'd recommend having "proactive rest" which means consciously seeking out relaxing things. Sometimes you've gotta have periods of that. Having introverted friends can help too, so you can just talk about ideas & concepts and have deep connections (not that extroverted people don't hvae deep connections, but it tends to happen that I hvae more deep connections with introverts). \n\n
3	It might be worth you looking into whether you‚Äôre a ‚Äúhighly sensitive person‚Äù or not. It‚Äôs a trait more usually associated with the ‚ÄúI‚Äù types but I‚Äôm an ENFP and sit right on the border of being one according to the test in ‚ÄúThe Highly Sensitive Person‚Äù by Elaine Aaron, and it sounds like you could be one too. Good luck on your journey :)
3	The party thing could be social anxiety. I had social anxiety disorder most of my life and at parties I would feel so different. I couldn't really talk to anyone and just floated around.\n\nBut ENFP's also need a lot of alone time. I would say we are up and social like 30% and then want alone time 70%. We are the most introverted extrovert. We need alone time to relax and decompress and analyze what we experienced. We also use it to learn new things on our own. So enjoying being alone is fine. I don't think you are depressed though I can't say for sure. But it sounds more like you are just learning to like being a lone as well as with people.
1	Our inferior function is Si. We don't keep track of our emotional/energy reserves as well as other types.\n\nIf you want to be by yourself at times when you usually did not, it might be because you are being overwhelmed or extending yourself out too much. Everyone needs to rest, and ENFPs are pretty bad at recognizing that.
2	Adventure Time Sunday!	\n/r/ENFP! What shenanigans have you been up to this week? Any new adventures planned for the next?\n\nLet's here some stories!
2	The first half of my week felt like a rather nasty bout of depression, not getting much done and just being down all day. I managed to turn it a bit starting Wednesday evening - doing a big purge-like cleaning helped a lot. Then I've had plans every night, from drinking and playing games with friends to lindy hop dancing and ye olde club dancing, ending with some more blues tonight in a bit. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope to do better the coming week and spend more time cleaning/throwing away stuff I don't want around anymore. Yes, the "spark joy" craze caught me as well! With that I hope I can have lots of fun plans throughout the week, maybe even have my fingers crossed for a classic date, and get in touch with a company I used to work for. :)
6	What's your favorite ENFP meme?	
7	This one is always good for a [laugh.](https://imgur.com/a/by9xzSp)
9	The one where I go to make my own ENFP meme, try out like 4 different formats, have 3 different photoshop tabs open, and then quit them all to build something in Minecraft 
6	How do you get over heartbreak?	Feelings are too intense and overwhelming. It‚Äôs been a few months but I‚Äôm still completely devastated :( 
5	It took me 2 years to get over my ex. In some ways I'll never be over her. It's cliche but time heals all wounds. You're just gonna have to slog through it and every day will get a little better.
5	You don't get over a heartbreak, instead you learn to live with it. 
3	Oh man, I felt the pain in your post. Do you like to do anything creative in nature? I write poems and it helps to channel the pain somewhere. Gets it out of your head, you know? \n\nPlus, when it‚Äôs over you can go back and look at something beautiful made from heartache.\n\nHope you feel better real soon!
2	I have had to break up with my ENFP because of external factors and it really hurts the shit out of me seeing how badly she has to cope up with it. I can think myself out of sadness and loneliness but she certainly cannot :/
18	ENFPs who are like 25 and older- what are you like as an ENFP?	As I‚Äôm nearing 23, I find myself not really relating to the stereotypical ENFP. \n\nI‚Äôve retaken the test and I‚Äôm still an ENFP through and through. So I‚Äôm wondering, what are adult ENFPs like? How do you balance your work life, home life, and social life? How do you interact with your coworkers? What are you doing in your free time? What parts of yourself do you see as really ENFP? Do you relate to the ENFP stereotype?\n\n(I chose 25 years and older because your brain is fully developed. Also most people are usually well out of college by that point and have a few years experience in the working world.)
24	I'm 27 years old. I am very focused in my career (currently working full time and studying for a part time Masters degree) but make enough room to spend time with close friends and family. My "ENFP stereotypes" are less noticeable as I continue to grow, but my ENFP qualities are deeply infused in my personality. I still have optimism like most ENFPs and use that optimism to try and motivate positive results around me. I still suck at organization, but I am continually tackling that problem each day. I still smile and socialize, often times in conferences and networking events. And the list continues...\n\nDon't think about these "changes" as a shift in personality. MBTI becomes less accurate as you grow older, because most of our functions are at a notable level of maturity. I still relate to the ENFP personality, because it is what I grew up with since I was a child. I know that deep down inside, there is still that playful, naive childlike persona lost in my complex developing personality, but when someone is faced with a ton of experiences, both good and bad, you begin making adaptations without losing the true definition of who you are. You are still you 5 years ago. You will eventually mature and grow from all of your experiences.\n\nTo be honest, I love being ENFP. It was a great experience for me in the past, it is a great experience right now, and it will be a great experience for me in the future. I hope you feel the same as well.
13	As children we are all Extroverted Intuition, crazy and fun and full of ideas. Then as teens and early 20's we develop Introverted Feeling too and get more emotional and develop our views which really just adds more thoughts to our crowded minds. But as late 20's/30's we develop Extroverted Thinking. This allows us to be more action oriented and to be more efficient and organized. We can finally focus and get stuff done. Sometimes. Then as we get 40+ we develop Introverted Sensing too and learn the value of routine and simple tasks more. Or so I hear. I am 32.\n\nI definitely am more confident and assertive than I used to be. And I don't care what anyone thinks. I used to have social anxiety disorder so that's a big change. I welcome criticism so I can grow. I am learning to be less insecure. I feel stronger and more mature. Basically I find I am becoming less the unicorn and more the magic knight on its back. The true champion and hero we are known as.
11	Hey OP, 30 year old enfp here.. \n\nI have become a group maker.  I am the guy that makes sure all of my friends get together hrart about every week.  I have modeled honesty and openness in the group and now we have a lot of support for eachother in it.  It's pretty awesome..\n\nFor work I have a couple jobs.  I work at a theater doing lights for productions,  but the job I care about is a counseling job.  I go from school to school in local districts,  running therapy groups for at risk kids.  It's highly variable and I love it. \n\nIm also going to school. I didn't really have the money to finish school before but now I do,  so I'm finishing a bachelor's in applied anthropology and planning to move to another state to get a master's in counseling.  \n\nIm also a husband and a father.  Ive learned how to cook really well,  and my enthusiasm for cooking has only grown as ive become better.  I let myself get obsessed with cast iron stuff and healthy cooking... I think that with getting older, my obsessions have just changed a little.  I still feel like myself. \n\nMy wife and I own a home..\nBtw home design is so fun! Keeping the home clean is hard though. \n\nOverall,  I feel like age has refined me into something fun but serious.  I haven't changed too much though. 
8	30yr ENFP here. \n\nI found a pretty good, but draining routine. I'm a teacher in Germany and that job is just great. You have something new every day and can get creative. But all the organization and list keeping (I HATE GRADES) really sucks. Also I have a lot of people to interact with during the day (I teach aprox 300 kids and have 100 fellow teachers in my school) and that's where you can shine. I start new projects at school and am part of different groups to organize stuff... BUT I need my alone time after school and use that to recharge and reflect after the day.\n\nBeing a teacher also means to have 14 weeks of vacation a year and that's where the fun begins. Almost every vacation I'm traveling somewhere else (doesn't have to be expensive) and try to make it an adventure. Also I have picked up a lot of hobbies (succulents, metal detecting, Ukulele, growing vegetables, Geocaching...) over the years and try to advance at them.\n\nSocially I have pretty much two groups of friend I do stuff regularly with. I'm the one who keeps pushing for new stuff to try and planning meet ups and it's actually working great! \n\nI relate a lot to the ENFP stereotype, but I tend to be on the more introvert side of the spectrum (but not INFP). 
4	I‚Äôm 37f, I relate to ENFP stereotypes but fight hard to work on my Si and the older I get the easier it is to do my weaker functions. I still struggle with extreme boredom during monotonous tasks, getting distracted and not finishing projects, and staying committed when I promise something. Because I struggle with that stuff, my Te has figured out work-arounds to my issues. Messy house all the time? I figured out that minimalism works best. Less shit, less to clean! I stopped promising people I‚Äôd be at their functions... instead I tell them I‚Äôm not sure if I can make it and I‚Äôll let them know asap. That gives me an ‚Äúout‚Äù when I‚Äôm no longer feelin it. I used to work a boring job, I changed paths to a lower paying job that gives me some freedom and let‚Äôs me do something different every day. I set up auto-pay on all of my bills, I (Si) systematized a lot of my life so I don‚Äôt have to deal with the Si crap every month. Example: Auto order dog food and laundry soap from Amazon every month, grocery shopping once a week in smaller batches rather than huge, overwhelming grocery hauls etc. Oh! Also I stopped participating in every fucking hobby that looks fun. I have a few rabbit hole hobbies I enjoy that don‚Äôt take a lot of effort, time, consistency, follow through.. so instead of something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm totally gonna learn to scrapbook‚Äù (soooo much time/$/dedication) I decided to play a video game instead. It‚Äôll be there when I want to play and I only spent $50 once. To round out my wall of text, my secret for being a ‚Äúgrown up‚Äù ENFP is to admit your faults, lean into them and find some work-arounds to deal with your shortcomings. If you struggle with finishing stuff, stop starting stuff! If you are disorganized, purge the crap and live more simply. If you can‚Äôt remember to pay your bills, sit down and Te figure out how to Si your life a little bit so you‚Äôre free to do the NeFi fun stuff! 
4	You should check out the ENFP survival guide and read up on the cognitive funcgions. The stereotypical enfp is a bubbling child or teen or young 20s but your 3rd and 4th function develop at 25-30+. You're still enfp, but with more cognitive ability. \n\n
3	I am 34. I kinda just take it easy really. I am pretty boring nowadays you could say. I see my friends when the mood is there, and I spend most of my free time with my girlfriend. I've changed circles of friends enough time that i don't really get along with past acquaintances anymore so it reinforces me to just do my own thing. \n\nI work as a data architect / IT product manager at one of the main investment banks. It works on my flaws but it doesn't resonate with me emotionally. Perhaps I might develop a passion for it eventually. So work doesn't really take over.\n\nCoworkers like me, but they're not my BFFs. I have really few now.  \n\nIn the past, I used to burn through my free time as if I was going to die soon. I became a BJJ blackbelt and taught class. I did yoga. I maintained real estate and built a large house. I did an MBA. I tried to be a socialite and attend every networking/art/professional event that could be possible. I wanted to be an investment guru to reach financial independence by my own means, so i was going through the CFA program but dropped out midway. Now i spend my alone free time just cooking, playing strategy games, reading reddit and books. I must have calmed down because the failure of the CFA was pretty soul crushing and brainwashing. I think I want to be a polyglot next, and perhaps exploring on how to be an IT freelancer with a focus on AI.\n\nIt's the openness, curiosity and agreeableness that makes me quite ENFP. I used to have super emotional highs and very deep lows. Now I am super chill, but there was a lot of soul searching, external help, and studies.\n\n&#x200B;
3	I'm a lot more driven at 30 than I was when I was younger. I feel like I finally have a clear vision for my life. \n\nI've always loved reading and recently I prefer non-fiction. I've started and joined a couple different book clubs, but rn I only have time for one. I volunteer a lot & like trying lots of crafts and music. And I like exercising.\nI have switched jobs from yoga teaching, to community organizing, to dog walking. Now I'm going to school full time to get my bachelors and eventually my masters in counseling. \n\nI used to imagine I'd be married by now. I do have a boyfriend of 8 months but I don't know how serious it is. Sometimes I'm like I'm awesome and independent & other days I worry.\n\nI don't have a good relationship with my family. They are fine but it was tough when I was younger my parents were not good at parenting. As I'm getting older I've learned to enjoy my mom. I do have close friends though. \n\nI think the biggest difference between who I was and who I am is I just feel more secure. I feel like I have permission to be. Also a big part of growing up was accepting all the parts of me, including my faults, and integrating them into one.
2	Hello! 28 yo ENFP female. I just got married last year and finished my masters degree in counseling (I‚Äôm noticing a trend). I‚Äôm still in that awkward phase of transitioning from the stereotypical ENFP to adulting. I have a really stressful job and work with court mandated clients, but I still like to go out (or stay in) and party on the weekends. My husband is an ESFJ, and he‚Äôs the most stable thing I‚Äôve ever had in my life. We go on adventures. We just bought a cool house in one of my favorite ‚Äúhip‚Äù neighborhoods. I am really happy with my life. Still struggle with anxiety (mostly job related now). Getting back on my meds on Monday. Believe in self care to the highest degree. I get regular massages and see my own therapist; have been trying to be more observant of my own feelings in a situation, and am increasing mind-body connection through mindfulness and massage. I have a lot of counselor friends, who I see on a range of one per week to once a month. I need my socialization still; my husband can be this but in order to have my existential conversation needs fully met, I still gotta have my friends. \n\n\nIn my younger years, I was boy crazy. Terrified of abandonment. Really attention seeking (still can be at times). Glad to have settled down.
2	35 here. Raging ENFP in every sense - never tested as anything else, even on my most off days. I teach music to kindergarten through eighth grade. It's perfect for me - I don't think I'd survive in a job where playfulness wasn't one of the top requirements. Like FraeRitter said above, I HATE the records-keeping part of it, but I'm also determined to do it well.\n\nI'm single, and I choose to live with friends - I can retreat into my room and get my essential alone time, but I like having people around to talk to. I've finally learned to keep plants alive, after a lifetime of spacing out and forgetting about them, and they make me very happy. I play around ten instruments and have far too many hobbies (I'm on a synchronized swim team, I do weaving and needle felting, my friend and I are writing a sitcom, I make video art, I really want to get a sewing machine and learn to make my own clothes, ETC). \n\nSometimes I do feel like people at work think I'm a giant child, but I just try my hardest to play to my strengths. I'm a thousand times less anxious than when I was younger, but my room will probably always be a mess. 
1	im 25 and tbh I still don't feel my brain is fully developed, I still think I have an obvious weakness and strengths . like...its very difficult to hide my weakness or strength , as my bf describes I'm odd lol.\n\n\------------working life--\n\nso I graduated from master degree  of fine art last September and started my first full time job as designer in company, I've freelanced and drew illustration for book and clients for two years since I was studying. but  working in company is quite different, you follow rules and steps that made by company no matter it suits you or not, and yes, its very tough for me. so as I said, my weakness is obvious, I'm still forgetful , I'm still trying hard to remember details and steps and endure the boreness lol. but I like my job overall, I like art and design and create. and I'm good at it.\n\nwhen I work I don't talk that much, and I absolutely don't like communicating lol , like making calls or responding emails etc... so boring and unsatisfying for me. so I'm glad I design, so most of time I can dive in my own world without try to let people understand me.\n\nI never know how my managers think of me, but I know I'm not so good at expressing my thoughts, and my logic are mostly different from them, which makes me a bit awkward some times, my working partner quite likes me tho, I'm fun.\n\n\--------------personal life--\n\nI have most loyal friends of the world lol haha okay yea they are very supportive and protective for me, I'm so comfortable and spoiled by them, it feels like whatever I do, they like it.  I think most of people like me, but would find me a bit odd later on, and it is the point they gonna be my very good friend or okay acquaintances.  I think people won't dislike me mostly, but just don't get it what I'm doing etc. again, in company life, it could be a bit pressure to fit in, especially I'm the youngest and most inexperienced there. but personal life, my friends are great and I attract people by who I'm really am.\n\n\-------------lifestyle---------\n\nim a hardworking , especially in this life stage, I need to work my face off. I was way more artsy . carefree and a bit hippie when I was 20(when mom still gave my allowance lol), but I'm always ambitious , so now the ambitious side of me really takes it over.  now, I also work on my own illustration stuffs on weekends, hella tired but I gonna stick to it and stay firm until I make it, so ill stay firmer even lol. I still love traveling and would take short trip sometimes. also id learn new stuffs in my free time, I enjoy learning and exploring.  I have so many hobbies and would love to do them all if I pass this life stage . have more save and live more comfortably.\n\n\----------am I enfp?\n\nI think deep inside and when I'm around my friends, yea, I'm hella enfp. but in work, NO, big no, probably more infp or sth, no ideas.\n\nthankyou for reading my thesis, I just came home from work and goddamn tired . talking makes me relax, so here you go :p\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
4	I just found out one of my favourite YouTubers is an Anti-Vaxxer who is also against LGBTQ+ rights...	I don‚Äôt know if this sudden devastation I feel is an ENFP thing, but I feel really hurt. Not only do I have a weak immune system, but I‚Äôm also Bi. I know it‚Äôs not a personal attack on me, obviously, but she is fundamentally against two things that directly affect me. My friend who‚Äôs an ENTJ was simply saying ‚Äúeh, well, I like her aesthetic so...‚Äù and I do too,  but this is a huge line for me for some reason. My morals are having a hard time with this one. I don‚Äôt hate her for her choices or anything, but it‚Äôs the ignorance and refusal to think of everyone as part of a larger picture for humanity. Can anyone relate??? 
8	If I morally disagree with someone I don't support their content. I'll be friends with someone I don't agree with, but I don't pay my friends who have shitty beliefs to keep having them, so why would I do it with someone else? \n\nYou don't have to support something that makes you morally uncomfortable. You're not denying them anything by choosing not to watch their content. (no one is entitled to your consumption of their content)
1	We are mostly talking about marriage rights, right? In which case, I don‚Äôt see why anybody cares to be against two people who love each other getting together. \n\nI think most people who are anti lgb rights are mostly against socialism and rampant left extremism and they see this as an aspect of that. 
1	I suppose you have to ask yourself why you thought someone you liked had to believe the same thing you do?\n\nPerhaps it's something you learn as you mature, or perhaps it's something you SHOULD learn as you mature, but it's a good idea to not project your own beliefs on others or assume that because they are likeable, they must hold beliefs similar to yours.\n\nPersonally, I've found deeply rewarding friendships with people I have fundamental disagreements with.\n\nSo, why not let your ENFP empathy go to work understanding WHY she is this way, and learn to seperate the parts of her that you disagree with from the parts that you enjoy and agree with. 
21	Such a helpful list	
2	Good though I never consider criticism as a personal slight. I welcome criticism because if you don't know what's wrong how can you grow?\n\nI also always consider the facts. In fact in arguments I'm the one presenting evidence and facts. And my views can change if I learn better information.
1	That‚Äôs a great point! Thanks for sharing :) I gotta practice being more like that
187	Anyone else find themselves drawn to people who are hard to ‚Äúread‚Äù?	I‚Äôve always found it incredibly easy to ‚Äúread‚Äù people and I‚Äôm pretty sure other ENFP‚Äôs have similar experiences. I also find myself attracted primarily to people are are hard to ‚Äúread‚Äù; not guarded, necessarily or introverted, just people whose signals I can‚Äôt really pick up on easily. In a crowd or social setting, it‚Äôs usually pretty easy for me to gauge other people‚Äôs wants, fears, insecurities, their ‚Äútype‚Äù and whatnot but some people I just can‚Äôt and I find myself drawn to these people romantically and platonically. \n\nAnyone else feel the same?
62	Why I fell in love with an INTJ, did not work out well 
32	Fits me to a T.
27	Yes. I love a challenge.
26	Not necessarily. I find more value when shy people feel more comfortable to be themselves around me. Easier said than done haha
26	As a reserved INFP who's often been called "mysterious" and has a thing for ENFPs, this post gives me hope
17	How did you know??? There‚Äôs a girl who I‚Äôve never heard utter a feeling word, only thought words. As in I know her opinions on things but have no idea how she feels on things/ me, which is just so interesting for someone like myself who is 90% feelings and shares them perhaps too readily ;)
12	I am so attracted to people I can't read. I think it's more of a fascination with what's makes them so mysterious or guarded. I guess being able to read people so quickly we get really bored so when we find someone that requires a bit more effort out of us, we stick in around to find out more. Unfortunately, like always, once I figure them out, I get bored extremely quickly. Haha Sigh... Life of an ENFP ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
11	Ugggghhhhhhh this is the epitome of me and the ISTP I‚Äôm currently smitten with. I‚Äôd say my feelings about it are 49% intrigue and 51% annoyance haha
6	Yup. I‚Äôve always been drawn to mysterious, introverted types. That‚Äôs less the case now because I married one of those and stretch my introvert muscles with him so often that I gravitate toward the energy (extroverts) these days. Still intrigued by the hard-to-read, though!   
4	It's gotten me into trouble a couple times before, as a kid and as a big kid.\n\nAsking a lot of questions and talking to strangers, I think journalism would've been fun 
3	yes i have always been extremely drawn to introverts and those who did not wear everything on their sleeve. i remember as a child going out of my way to become friends with kids who were usually ignored. i think it comes from this curiosity of how awesome they could be without anyone knowing. \n\nhowever often i come out of this process disappointed, and as i grew up learned to not dive into a relationship just because i initially found the person intriguing, as well as find the ability to appreciate the awesomeness of people who wear their awesomeness on their sleeve. all in all i‚Äôm really glad i‚Äôve been able to change this view on people as i‚Äôve matured bc otherwise i would miss out on a ton of great people and be stuck in a ton of mediocre friendships that i forced myself into based on possibility.
3	I think because we read people so easily, so often, we are *seriously intrigued* when we can‚Äôt read them quite so easily. 
5	We find it so easy to read people so when we do meet someone who we can't read so easily they're very intriguing. It feels like opening a present when you get to know them - sometimes it's super fun and sometimes it's  disappointing. I work with this girl who I just can't read at all though. I think of her as a NPC (non-playable character) cos when you talk to her it's like there's just nobody home.
3	Probably why I married my INTJ üòä
3	Yeah that‚Äôs why I liked my wife. Hard part is that long term, it makes it hard to predict one another. 
3	They just make me so darn curious! What are they hiding?! WHERE IS SHE?!\n\nBut seriously, I really enjoy opening them up and understanding them both for my personal amusement and to know how to make them happy. \^\_\^
3	My girlfriend of almost 6 years is an INTJ and I still find her hard to read at times. She hates being told she‚Äôs hard to read.\n\nBut yeah, something about problem solving and the mystery of it and wanting to break through to them, I guess. 
3	Ohhhhh my godddd the only reason I started crushing on an INTP was because I couldnt read them like the rest. I thought they were so intriguing by being hard to read and then struggled in a relationship for 3 years. Hope I don‚Äôt do that again 
2	Everything I‚Äôm feeling put into words!
2	Yes both friends and crushes.
2	Maybe when I was younger, but as I‚Äôve gotten older and met more people, there are less that are difficult for me to read and I‚Äôve become comfortable with almost all types. I am more attracted to people who are different from me but share similar values though because I think it keeps things interesting. My best friend right now is an ESTP (straight shooter, similar opinions), ISFP (sensitive, honest and kind).
2	EXACTLY!!! Thank you for putting it into words... I basically see new people as challenges and whenever I meet someone new I always try to guess who they are just based on what they "feel" like to me... and when someone reaches beyond my expectations they become one of my new favourite people to hang out with because there's still so much to explore!
1	Tbh not really.
1	Yes I constantly feel this and sometimes it gets annoying 
1	There's something mysterious & exciting about introverts that I just love. And I tend to keep a lot to myself as well, so they get drawn into that as well. Typically its the introverts or thinkers being all mysterious n' what not.  
1	Definitely feel the same way. It‚Äôs intriguing. 
1	I think we're drawn to unpredictable\nMystery\nEerie stuffs in general\nOr is it just me?
1	Absolutely 
1	I‚Äôm an INFJ and I have a ENTP bff, she‚Äôs a handful but I love her anyway 
1	Nope. I can really like a person and hang out with them a bit, but if I can't read their face or don't know what to expect I will get bored very quickly. 
1	I am reaching the point where I don't want to be involved with those that are "hard to read". Too many assumptions to make which tends to lead to emotional pain and quite honestly, I am done with that. I rather prefer those who are straightforward with their intentions and that their actions show that. 
1	YES!
1	This is literally why I started talking to my now best friend
8	You guys are awesome!	As an infp, I just  want to say you guys are what I want to be. I want the courage to do all these things i plan in my head but i cant step out the door to make that charity, or to jump off that cliff, or build that commune. I admire you guys and your type so much
2	Well, to be honest most ENFP's are more about ideas and don't actually get much done. But that's ok because ideas are fun in themselves to us.
2	Why not?\n\nYes ENFPs are the greatest üòãüíó but INFPs are incredible too ü§ó!\n\nI have a younger brother who is an INFP, plus I met other superb INFPs along the way, my relationships have taught me to ask how can I help especially with shy and anxious INFPs.\n\nWhat do you need from the environment and your relationships to fill more at ease, and once that happens simultaneously what will energize you so you will challenge yourself? \n\nYou INFPs have so much to give, you just need some clay and color pigments to make your imagination into reality by pressing your ideas into form, by bringing your originality into being, aka an arche--type.
1	My INFP uncle made me the ENFP deep thinker I am today! I‚Äôve had the most deep and fulfilling conversations with that guy.\n\nThe kinds of conversations that necessitate extra sleep the next day for your poor brain!\n\nINFP‚Äôs are cool! 
4	Let's brainstorm a new sub-description!	Hey guys!\n\nAfter I visited the ENTP sub for some reason and came across this [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/ajxo8z/request_can_we_please_change_the_description_of/), I think we also desperately need a new description. We already have a very vibrant and colorful title picture that perfectly displays our nature. The description on the other hand just lists our functions and it doesn't resonante at all with how creative, imaginative and supporting we all are.\n\nI mean we all are supposed to be such passionate idea generators but description-wise we are put to shame by for example the [ESFP](https://www.reddit.com/r/ESFP) (seriously, their description is really great).\n\nSo I say, let's gather new ideas!\n\nSome examples to get you started:\n\n* " Even when nobody understands you, we do. "\n* " Colorful heart, beautiful mind - this is our realm. Stay with us. "\n*  " Oh look, a squirrel! "\n\nOkay, I'm kinda cringy but you get the gist. Let me read your suggestions!
5	"Sorry, we couldn¬¥t decide description" :D\n\n"You are entering magically chaotic (and also therapeutic) realm"\n\n"ENFPs inside, do open and stay <3"\n\n"Sunrays in a deep ocean bottom"\n\n"We are kindergarten at outside, but inside we are a library" (Okay, i am not sure if this is too boasty)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n...i tried.
3	How about: \n\n"I like THIS description, not THAT one is better. Wait THIS is a good idea, too. Maybe we need a new banner? Oh, and i could change the format of the sub...  "
3	###Lead from the front\n   \n^Check&nbsp;sticky&nbsp;note&nbsp;to&nbsp;remember&nbsp;why
3	"Come see our perspective, we've already seen all of yours."
3	Right now I feel like our description is perfect for demonstrating how bad we are at finishing projects.

7	Suppressing emotions?	Is this an ENFP thing or a me thing? I tend to distract myself from uncomfortable feelings with thoughts and just let myself feel fully and physically sad about a breakup that I‚Äôve been trying for a long time to block out and move on from. I have to say, letting myself feel those feelings is really nice and something I should do more often. 
4	" Type 7 ENFPs are likely to be particularly heavy on extroverted  intuition and extroverted thinking and may find introverted feeling to  be their blind spot in their stacking. Type 7s tend to avoid processing  negative emotions, which may cause the ENFP to repress many of their  deeply-felt experiences of sadness or pain. These ENFPs are the ones who  are constantly looking for the next great challenge, adventure or  thrill. (...) " \[[https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2016/01/mbti-and-the-enneagram-2/17/](https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2016/01/mbti-and-the-enneagram-2/17/)\]\n\nIt is a common trait for Enneagram 7 ENFPs which I am too and I strongly relate to your post.  I lived a long portion of my life either distractig myself from difficult situations or rationalising them to the point where I can find logical solutions. \n\n>  I have to say, letting myself feel those feelings is really nice and something I should do more often. \n\nI completely agree. Just letting Types aside for a sec, it is healthy in general to let your feelings touch your heart. It is an important part of personal development and telling from my own experience, it makes you become both more sensitive but overall more internally stable.
24	Note to self: You're not going to run out of time by taking things a little slower.	You're definitely going to run out of time by not getting started.
4	it‚Äôs true. üòä
3	Great note to self for me to note to myself too lol. Thanks!üòä
2	Thanks needed to hear this
12	do people say you get excited/amazed at everything?	
14	I am often asked if I am high
10	I have a certain puppy side, yes. 
4	Yes, all the time. They always ask if I am drunk or high. 
3	When I was younger. Do older ENFPs feel more mellowed out? (I‚Äôm 27)
4	Someone told me I give off an ‚Äúexcited vibe‚Äù. I‚Äôm 25 and if I‚Äôm feeling in a good mood I‚Äôll be hyper and excited about everything lol. But when I‚Äôm by myself I‚Äôm much more mellow and less amazed by everything. I appreciate my alone time to process because it balances out the excitedness that I have when I‚Äôm extroverting 
5	My flatmate and I are both enfp and we are excited easily, often, and with big reactions (happy dances, jumping up and down, big gestures, big facial expressions, little excited squeals, etc). It just happens naturally. 
2	I get it a lot actually!
26	Slow motion multitasking ‚Äì Maybe this is why ENFP's are so creative!	Hey fellow ENFPs, \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe TED podcast posted today 'A powerful way to unleash your natural creativity' by Tim Harford pretty much describes our ENFP personality and how our fascination and interest in multiple subjects/disciplines gives us a huge advantage for creative thinking. He calls it 'Slow Motion Multitasking', always having 2-4 different projects across different areas on the go so you can cross-train your mind across multiple subjects and find new ideas others would not have thought of! Worth a listen!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/powerful-way-to-unleash-your-natural-creativity-tim/id160904630?i=1000428464306&mt=2](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/powerful-way-to-unleash-your-natural-creativity-tim/id160904630?i=1000428464306&mt=2)
7	I think this is us too. Others lose that creativity but we don't.\n\nhttps://ideapod.com/born-creative-geniuses-education-system-dumbs-us-according-nasa-scientists/
3	Snap! i love the idea of cross-training your mind! How exciting and inspired! It makes me think of Polymaths. I absolutely love scouring this subreddit for inspiration!
4	\n:D (I didn't know what else to say but a smile)
2	Haha thanks for the excuse " I'm slow motion multitasking".
2	Yes but while creativity is ok, supply is way higher than demand. There are too many of us workwise and not enough of us politically
2	In what sense is ENFP supposedly more creative than other types?
19	Male ENFPs I'm wondering about something	I'm a male ENFP (20). I've slowly realized that I connect better with women than men. I have a lot of male friends and I love them, but I feel like the closest friends I have are women. The ones that I can tell anything to and the people that seem to understand me the most. A lot of my BEST FRIENDS have been women. Is anyone else similar?
16	women can keep up with the amount of talking I need to do
7	That was how I was back when I was your age (haha... I'm only 27 now). I'm not into a lot of stereotypical guy things (cars, video games, sports, etc.), and I'm very emotions-centric, so it takes a while to find people (guys specifically) who I really connect with. That being said, when I have found guys I connect with, they become some of my best best friends.
5	Definitely. And usually when i have close male friends they're either NFs or NTs. Maybe for me it was simply bad luck since most boys in my school/highschool fit in the douche category so i don't feel that comfortable around them. Girls however seem much more easier to get along with.\n
8	yeah, it's because your a lapdog for empathy, a real slut for emotion.  EMBRACE THE FEVER, KID.  Your feelings are gonna be your ticket outta here.
5	ENFP guys are the most fun! 
3	this thread gives me hope as a 21 yo male ENFP
3	Yup. Same here for (almost) my whole life. 44M ENFP
2	Same. I used to have exclusively male friends. Then I moved away for studies and I have only female friends (~6). I have 2-3 male friends, two of which are gay.\n\nAt the same time I have trouble getting into a relationship so idk what's that about.
1	Yes kind of! My best friends are male but otherwise I find girl's more fun. I think that's because men get bogged down by not expressing their emotions. Even Thinking types have emotions, but men aren't as comfortable feeling and expressing. Women are much more in tune with emotions
1	Huh, interestingly as a woman almost all of my friends are men, for the exact same reasons you just listed
1	All of my friends are women. I'm going on 22 here soon.
3	What type of peeps y‚Äôall don‚Äôt like?	For me I guess just extremely shallow people, idk I love the deep (or even just long) convos that I always have with my fellas,homies,partnas, (and dare I say compadres), and it sucks that some people just can‚Äôt talk about stuff like that. \n\nBut there is someone who I recently met, and I‚Äôm not sure if I don‚Äôt like her or whatever. Idk she always describes herself as an always angry and passive aggressive person and I can get a bit annoyed cus sometimes she can cross the line for me and it gets annoying to hear her rant. But idk if that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt like her. I feel really bad ab it too bc one of my closest friends is really close to her, but I just can‚Äôt seem to feel the same. I genuinely don‚Äôt know what it is. I‚Äôm planning to confront about the person that‚Äôs close with her, cus no way am I gonna tell the person I feel mix towards and say ‚Äúhey I think I don‚Äôt like you‚Äù even if I find a better way of saying it, I‚Äôll end up not saying that cus I‚Äôm a moron. Sorry if this seems petty and long winded, but I‚Äôm genuinely curious about your pet peeves about people, and maybe I can at least try to pinpoint what I don‚Äôt like about her
9	Idc if someone‚Äôs shallow or whatever, as long as they are positive and have good vibes. I just don‚Äôt like entitled people with shit attitudes. 
8	People who (strongly) constantly display one or more of these attributes: shallow, shitty attitude, passive aggressive, only seeking personal gain / selfish, trying to look good by putting others down, always seeing the negative, pushy, authorative, malicious, clingy.
4	I used to work with a girl who could find the negative in every situation... and actively complained about it incessantly.\n\nFor example, we were responsible for planning a work event in Florida in a beautiful beachfront hotel. The day we arrived, my entire team decided to go spend some time on the beach. She complained about the sun, then the sand, the saltwater, the way she looks in bathing suits, the flight there.\n\nI really wish I was exaggerating. That‚Äôs just one anecdotal example, but you get the idea.
4	I can¬¥t stand arrogant people. 
3	Controlling/Manipulative people annoy me along with the people who don‚Äôt like change and are very closed off to everything. Idk why it just rubs my the wrong way feeling wise. 
3	I love how you all talk about a certain image that comes to mind rather than just 4 letters. Haha. \n\n
3	I HATE people who brag about themselves, and constantly feel the need to remind others about their accomplishments. Arrogance also ties in with this quality. Stfu. Be humble. 
2	Mean or tools. I hate mean and judgmental people, I just get annoyed by people pleasers. 
2	Users, people who want to control everything I do, and kids asses
2	People who are: narrow-minded, judgemental, selfish, insensitive, passive aggressive, petty, shallow, or extremely stubborn
5	What is your close friend circle like and how do you feel about them?	In my close friend group, I‚Äôd say I have about 10. I love them all so fuckin much and I let them know everyday. I know that my two closest out of the closest friends are an INFJ and an INFP. Also have an INTJ in there as well and I bet the ppl I consider my close friends also share their/my personality to a certain extent cus I can seee itt. I just have this never ending love for all of them and I genuinely can see all of us staying in touch for life. What I‚Äôm wanting to ask though is how do you guys feel about the ones closest to you and what personality types are they?
2	My closest friends right now are an Isfp, an ESTP, an entj, an infp, an estj, an infj and an ENTP. I will have to say that I like all these people for their individual personalities and not necessarily their types because I‚Äôve met other people of their type and not liked them or not gotten along with them. I love my friends but I don‚Äôt express it that much because they‚Äôre not really the expressive type. We do a lot of things together and have a lot of banter. I love to banter and tease my friends. Anything else you want to know?
2	I have no clue about anyone's type, but there's 7 of us in my main friend group, and then I have lots of "seperate" friends I hang out with besides them. We're all creatives and some are very technically talented as well, huge geeks, and all really well in sync. We like how everyone has their sitcom-role to play! All seperate friends I have are all very different, and I like everyone for different reasons. Most of them I've met while dancing - a hobby I never quite got my main friend group to join for. :')
2	very safe and loved kekekek I dunno, when they take care of me, I feel great \^\^ but I'm kinda like an out of control person so its actually pretty odd to find that I like to be taken care of by them.  but also they are very fun people and share the same life values with me, we are all hard workers. I think it is just I'm pretty bad at taking care of things, my closets my rooms etc and they kinda balance me. 
13	Do you often get annoyed or eclipsed by other Extrovert-type persons?	Many people close to me think that I'm introvert, but I realized that this happens mostly when I'm eclipsed by another, more powerful Extrovert person, and sometimes I get so annoyed by that that I could even cut off the relationship because of that. I think that's an eye opening for me to realize I'm indeed an extrovert person (but ENFP), because Introvert persons (at least, whom I know) aren't usually bothered by other very extrovert people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do you think about this? Do you think this is something to try to be aware of and handle better?
18	I don‚Äôt know where I read it but someone said about ENFPs that they are extroverts in a crowd of introverts and introverts in a crowd of extroverts. Sounds a bit like what you mean. \n\nI think it‚Äôs worth exploring your feelings on it if it‚Äôs costing you personal relationships but I don‚Äôt think the shift between sometimes being introverted and sometimes being extroverted is cause for concern. 
6	I remember I swore off dating extroverts for that reason, always fighting over the spotlight, always trying to teach other, and while you think they are listening they are just Brainstorming new things to teach you instead. \n\nblah, I said no I am the extrovert!!! I talk, you listen, that is how it goes!\n\nmy wife is ISFJ yay!
3	There are some extroverts that charge my battery and others that drain it. The showy ones that seem to have a total disregard for the feelings of myself and others SUPER annoy me.
2	I feel slightly put out by other, more powerful Extraverts but I try to play off their extraverted-ness. I like to fuel their energy a bit just to see how crazy they can get. Sometimes, I capture the attention back using this method or I am content to be the introvert in the crowd. For me, I actually really enjoyed dating an ENFJ that was 93% extraverted and I am 63% extraverted. It was fun being the introvert in the relationship for once.
2	I get annoyed by two types extroverts:\n\n1) those that pull attention for themselves for the sake of it. Example: ‚Äúlook at me! I‚Äôm drinking straight vodka out of the bottle. Am I not the craziest, fun-loving person here?‚Äù. Granted I do this myself sometimes when I‚Äôm drunk. So if the person‚Äôs doing it ‚Äúin the moment‚Äù I‚Äôm good with that.\n\n2) who I can detect insecurity (inauthentic confidence). Like talking about people that they know because they want to be perceived as popular.\n\nI don‚Äôt feel eclipsed. If I see someone being extrovert and reaching out to all kinds of people with authenticity and sincerity, I admire them.
223	I found the ENFP bird lol :)	
21	DAMN thats pretty
14	‚ÄúHey! :) Tell me about your day, you look a little melancholy.‚Äù
10	I find it amazing how a real living creature looks like it's blushing. Pikachu/Kirby bird ftw
6	A cockatiel! I had a couple growing up. I‚Äôd love to liken them to ENFPs. 
5	That's me in my next life
6	Aww. I want a bird.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n... but they're soo messy and need so much attention.
3	That could be any type tbh. Istj in disguise? Sure
4	My spouse always jokes, that i am all the happy birds, little dogs and hedgehogs that we see in every animal/humor compilation video :D And these especially.
3	Awww a little cockatiel!  :)  Love the expression.  Miss our Maxy, she was a cockatiel.
3	Ah, cockatiels...  Loud as hell, unwilling to shut up unless asleep, and as likely to bite the shit out of you as to wallow in attention from you.\n\nIs that what ENFPs are?
2	I‚Äôm an ENFP and I have cockatiels as pets!!!
2	kawaai
1	At this point anything is ENFP. Sorry to be a downer lol, but this is just a drawing of a cockatiel and it could pretty much be any type.
1	Need help from pros. 30 male enfp low part in life	I need professional help advice or something. Enfp apartment manager but no other job. I can‚Äôt work around or with people because I just grew strong hate for people Over past several years I‚Äôm depressed every day for past few years also hate life just want world war 3 to hurry up and start literally. I am married my wife and I are solid roommates now we lost all feeling for eachother and have both Mentally and emotionally moved passed eachother. Just live together for convienience of almost free rent. Live in San Diego. I‚Äôm a navy vet been out since 2011 only have few months GI bill left wasted it. Have nothing. The VA sucks. I Have about 1200$ To my name. I have no motivation for anyone or anything and my life consists of distinctive behaviors like smoking weed and watching porn etc and waiting for shit to just keep getting worse. I am very smart however lol not book but ENFP wise. I only call family so I don‚Äôt have to deal with it I personally lost all care and feeling for them I haven‚Äôt seen them in like 3-4 years some had kids shit going on but I haven‚Äôt been there. Yeah I know a lot is my mind and shit. There‚Äôs more stuff but hopefully this is enough info to build good picture. I just get fired from jobs I get because I just don‚Äôt give a shit about anything but I don‚Äôt want to kill myself I enjoy smoking weed and porn for now hahaha but I just want the world to end. Sorry the rest of you no hard feelings lol. My main concern is I only want to just have the shit I need to go get money and get set up with stuff. Anyways I‚Äôll appreciate anyone who can insightfully respond. Ask me I‚Äôm open I‚Äôm sure this one is allllllll on me in my life right now but I need help me it‚Äôs surprisingly hard to fucking get in this world. Funny shit talking is welcome lol
3	You sound very depressed and I‚Äôm sorry. Have you tried therapy and/or medication? How long have you felt this way? Smoking weed and watching porn will just continue the cycle of feeling shitty - try to get out and do something active to break the mood a bit and get the blood moving. Even if you have to force yourself for the first few minutes. You got this, man. 
3	Finding a new positive environment is key. As ENFPs, we are more reactive to the external world than others. The weed and porn is just a way to externally stimulate you.\n\nAn activity that helped me in the past was brazilian jiujitsu. It has that tribal mindset that can be useful to simply gather a new shared identity when you are unhappy with yourself. The sport gives you a good dose of adrenaline and endorphin that is addictive, so perhaps you could use that to wean yourself from your current self-destructive habits.\n\n&#x200B;
2	You have to break the cycle of ‚Äúsad feeling‚Äù my dude. Try adding more positive stimuli in your life whether it be externally (Music, movies, good food) or Internally (working on your self image/self awareness) more often than not we go extreme off the deep end when we‚Äôre feeling down but you also have to remember that spark of who you were and find that spark again. Your not lost maybe just side tracked but such is life. This low part of your life means when you find that spark it‚Äôs gonna be 20x greater than you could have ever imagined. I myself hit my lowest point ever in my life a few months ago but through finding a new passion my life has evolved and grow into something I could have never foreseen when I was down. ( Sorry for the rant lol I just really understand where you are at right now)
1	opinions about astrology	hey guys! hope you're having a wonderful day.\n\npersonally, i don't totally believe in astrology; i think it's too uncertain (astrology entertains me, but the mbti test is what i trust). however i can't resist to the fact of being so similar to my sign (aquarius), and i actually find a lot of similarities between being an aquarius and an enfp. i wanted to ask you a few questions about it:\n\n1) what do you think about astrology? do you believe in it or not?\n2) which is your sign? do you find yourself similar to it?\n3) if you believe in it, do you think it's connected in anyway to the mbti?\n\ni'd love to read your answers!! i'm new to the sub and i just can't understand how late i had the idea to search for it haha

2	I think its complete bullshit and designed so that everyone can see somthing familiar in his sign...
1	Astrology is as meaningful as you make it. Cognitively I know that the position of the planets doesn't affect my life. But spiritually, if there's anything in a prediction that positively impacts my life or encourages me to live in a better way, I emotionally accept it as "truth", regardless of its origins. Same with things like tarot cards or church sermons. Glean beautiful thoughts from wherever you can get them. 
1	Has anyone here dated an istj?	I would like to hear your experiences!  Oopsies dated or currently in a relationship with one. :) 
4	I was married to one for 10 years. It was not good. We got together when we were too young and while he was a good man (and extraordinarily handsome) our connection did not go deep. We were awfully decent to each other, which just meant it took longer for us to come to the conclusion that things were just not right.
2	So, let me start by saying he was really honest, and nice- annnnd then I was day dreaming about my ice cream in the fridge at home.\n\nThere was just no connection for me, he didn't like my morbid/bizarre humor \n\nor cutting through the grass.. lol \[\]
4	Here's some electronic music I made inspired by Modest Mouse	
1	PSA: If you make music and/or enjoy analyzing it through the lens of MBTI types, be sure to visit /r/MBTImusicians. I created it about a month ago. We have 83 subscribers so far, and over 20 people have posted music they‚Äôve made. :)  
4	The issue of options...	How do you deal with the issue of a plentiful sea of mates becoming especially tantalizing when you're in a good ol monogamous relationship? \n\nI love my partner, in fact he might be the only partner I've ever felt warm inside about.... but I started school again and the men in my program.... oh man.... eye candy up the wazoo (I am in a male dominated field). Not to say I'll hit on any of them or cheat, never, but then I get thoughts like "well if it doesn't work out I can just choose someone else in my field...." and I think it's too early for these thoughts. How do I get myself to stop being a little thought hoe?
4	You are attracted to men. That's why you're with your boyfriend. It's ok to be yourself and be attracted. As long as you never act on it it is healthy.
3	remind yourself of all the reasons you care about and love your partner, especially the little things he does for you that contribute to the warmth you feel toward him! (as simple as that may be!) as enfps, it's definitely easy for us to idealize people we don't know, especially when on the surface they have qualities we admire. i'm also in a male-dominated field at my school and occasionally i'll have similar thoughts, but i know they're superficial because upon deeper reflection, i always come back to the affirmation that the person i chose is the one i want to be with.
2	Omg I feel personally attacked hahahah this is so me! Especially the thoughts of potentially replacing our SO with some random fling that drives me nuts sometimes! I'd be like "ok brain stop". My trick is to think how great my current partner is, focusing on his positives rather than the negatives and when the thought gets intense (occasionally) I would just text him randomly or just send random memes to get him smiling or something  
1	Getting things done	Us ENFPs are known to come up with great ideas but not really following through them. As a fellow enfp, I want to know how some of you guys overcame this type of mentality and get things done?
3	I wouldn't say i have overcome it in general, but i think choosing hobbies with a lot of fast variety helps!\n\nLike learing many different songs on guitar or going metal detecting...
1	For me it was working on focusing abilities and really only focusing on the projects I really like. We often have interest in everything but you have to decide if your gonna still be interested a year or 2 down the road. Narrowing your projects boots your productivity and self growth because it‚Äôs often easier to do task associated with those projects. 
1	Enfp thoughts/reactions to threesomes(or more) with long term partner	I always feel emotional about the topic. Like I really wanna do it and I trust my partner but I feel like I don‚Äôt trust other people? Do any other enfps feel emotional about the subject? I feel like I‚Äôm holding myself back with all this emotion.
1	Same 
5	Does anyone feel like this ever?	I discovered I am an ENFP and reading about it so many things are starting to make sense.  Do any of you ever feel like you carry all your emotions in you and it's like this huge, deep ball of energy in your chest.  I'm so afraid to let that big bundled ball of energy out it's like it's this giant torrent of rushing water that i'm holding back.  If I let it out it feels like it's going to consume me.
5	Smoke some weed. Makes soul searching and sorting through thoughts and feelings super easy for me. 
3	Negative emotions, positive emotions? I tend to keep the negatives inside but the positives ... oh boy, put on my playlist and you‚Äôll see a fireball!
1	I deeefinitely agree. The vast majority of the time I'm feeling some kind of strong emotion - whether positive or negative. And the right music can make whatever I'm feeling that much longer lasting and that much more intense.\n\nIf you're looking for a way to kinda control it, I have to make the cliche suggestion of journaling. I started writing out my thoughts this year as one of my resolutions and I can already tell it's helping me manage my emotions so much. Some days, I won't have much to say at all, but others I'll write 6 pages in one sitting. Definitely helps me to put things on paper, so it *doesn't* feel like I have to carry that huge ball of energy around everywhere :)
1	I feel like this a lot I‚Äôll be doing little things and it feels like the ball cracks a little and I bleed the emotion out in a sentence that I didn‚Äôt mean or crying then it goes back and I hate I take it everywhere 
1	When you learn how to control that massive ball of energy it opens up unlimited possibilities for you, because you can turn your flow of energy off and on as you need it. 
1	It‚Äôs like when naruto finally got a good understanding of Kurumas chakra. Be Naruto except after he save the world lol.
3	Dealing with commitment issues ?	I'm no good at bringing stuff like this up, so I might aswell get down to it.\n\nI'm an 18 year old, male, ENFP, and I struggle with commitment issues. Like a lot of ENFP's, I tend to crush on someone real easily. Everyone I meet seems to make me feel like "God has finally sent me my soul mate." That part is annoying, but I can live with it.\n\nEven so, I've never had a girlfriend. Not through lack of ability or lack of oppurtunity. It's just my fear. My fear that one day, I'll be in a long commited relationship, where everything is perfect, and I'll wake up, take a look at my partners face, and just be bored. That thought scares me, unimaginably. The idea stops me in the tracks of pursuing any serious relationship with anyone, and I feel broken, hopeless and lonely.\n\nThe source of this fear probably stems from my childhood. My father walked out on my mother after cheating on her. I was raised by a single mother, who was (rightfully) bitter about what happened. I think what makes me so afraid, is the fact that I take after my father very much. I'm afraid I'll hurt someone like he hurt my mother.\n\nSo, I came here for guidance. Most of you are far more experienced than I am. Can you do this smalll favour for me ? If you've ever had what I have, could you offer up some advice  ? I'd really appreciate it very much.
3	oh man fear of being like our Fathers, is too common but not shared with others. I had struggled with that fear for sometime, I think ENFPs have it worse since our Si is not that strong especially in younger years. All I do now is just ignore all of those crazy "oh no, what if" and just say "shuttup! enough!"\n\nas far as being able to be vulnerable to a relationship, I found that I had to emotionally process painful events and then let them go and then I was able to find love because I was not afraid of the vulnerability pains from my past anymore. I already felt them and they left my body.\n\nLook into Trapped emotions and learn how to feel. That is what helped me. best of luck to you! oh and it is freakin painful and scary as hell but it can't kill you, it feels like the end of the world, but it will only last about 15mins at a time.
2	I think you have to remember that your actions are choices, and take responsibility for that. now that you're aware of your issue, you should be able to make better choices in that regard. It's kind of freeing to do that, to remember that we're not committed to repeating our parents' mistakes. \n\nAlso, most people I've known who are in long relationships have told me that after a while, things just settle down. I've been married 3 years now, and I agree üôÇ i think a lot of people make the mistake of expecting things to be super exciting all the time,like that fresh in-love feeling, the excitement of learning about each other, etc. So they think something is wrong when those feelings simmer down a little and regular life kicks in more. So expect that, and don't mistake it for a fundamental relationship problem when it comes üòâ \n\nAlso, trust your gut on picking people to date long term. Weird as it sounds, for years I had wanted to travel to Australia, and was thinking of going on exchange when I started uni. At 22, I felt uncomfortable being in a long term relationship, cos I just had this strong gut feeling I needed to be single when I eventually went. Despite ENFP stereotypes, many of us don't want to fool around & have flings - all I ever wanted was to get married üòõ I had gotten engaged to this guy, but something felt wrong about it, beyond just boredom or slowing down. I kept thinking I certainly could not be married when I go on exchange, & started to feel like I was getting married out of obligation. so I actually felt a bit of relief when my fiancee dumped me. I went to Australia 2 years later, and met my husband at university,& we've been together for like 10 years now.\n\nSo yeah, trust your gut, and be choosy about who to give it a go with, for a long term relationship. Honestly, in my experience, if true boredom comes up, it's more likely to happen early on due to a basic lack of compatibility. If you can make it past about the 6-7 month mark, any issues you face are more likely to be due to "real" things & not just boredom. And yeah, just remember your responses to all that are always your choices & act accordingly üôÇ sorry it's long, but I hope that helps! 
1	No risk, no reward.
1	Easier said then done, but you have to try to make sure not to become a product of ur environment. Recognize bad behavior and act the opposite. That‚Äôs how I learned to be a functioning member of society by learning from my parents bad behavior. I wouldn‚Äôt let it define me. 
1	I used to be like this. I used to be scared of being trapped in a relationship that I was bored with. It‚Äôs partly because of the lack of experiences...once you start meeting people and having serious relationships you start to realize that relationships come and go and when you meet someone who you want to spend the rest of your life with, you will just know. I think part of your fear is also hurting others, which is my fear too. I don‚Äôt want to get seriously involved with anyone I have doubts about it working out with because I don‚Äôt want to break up with them. But that‚Äôs life. It happens, and you can do it kindly. As you get older too and have more experiences to compare to, you may find that soul mate feeling become reserved for the truly special people you meet in your life. Hope that helps. :)
17	ENFP male femininity	Hey all,\n\nI am a young 20s ENFP male. Lately there's been a lot of quick changes in my life, so I'm sure that's making me more in touch with my inner world, but I have a question to ask:\n\nhave you ever felt like you aren't fully gender conforming at all?\n\nI don't really wish I were a girl fully, but as a male very in touch with his feelings, I often feel like my body does not suit me. I wish my body were more representative of how i feel that I am, like my personality and soul. I have so many different qualities but you are all so similar to me, I know you understand.\n\ni often long to be lusted after, to be adored or admired like the dream girls are in movies. I really crave affection and touch specifically, like gentle caresses. I wish I could be "pretty" a lot. I think of myself as cute, and small. I am in fact a small person, but my point is\n\nI just am struggling with how my body expresses my inner spirit, and the things that I want. I am both delicate and rugged, gentle and firm, sweet and fiery, lovely and broken. does anyone else struggle with how they appear to other people, even clothing or voice, those sorts of things?\n\ntl;dr body/gender dysphoria(???) seeking guidance
11	Yeah man, I know how you feel. Some of the things I do or say, my guy friends think I‚Äôm being girly or weird because I show more emotion. I‚Äôm over this ‚Äúmen can‚Äôt show their feelings‚Äù bs
7	Yes, this is part of the ENF type. It helps to know that stereotypical femininity is ENF while stereotypical masculinity is SF. Technically, true masculinity and femininity are INTP (e.g. He-Man and She-Ra, both INTP), while *effeminacy* is ENF and *feminization* is INF. Also, there are 3 times as many ENF females as males.\n\nI'm not transgender but if hyper-realistic virtual reality or other technology is invented I would definitely want to simulate having a female body for, uhh, reasons.
6	YESS THIS!!! Do i want to be a girl? NO! but  do I wanna be a guy? maybe not???? 
4	damn, that fourth paragraph can turn people on wtf\n\nwith that said, i'm the opposite of you in terms of wanting to be lusted after, and opposites attract. hmu ;) 
4	have you looked into non-binary genders? what you're describing does sound like gender dysphoria, dysphoria doesn't need to be intense or clinically significant, and you don't have to be fully uncomfortable with your gender to experience it <3 'transfeminine' might describe your experience? just a thought though!
3	I hear that! I think clothing is a phenomenal way to play with these kinds of stereotypes, because gender is performative! So if you perform your gender a little more feminine, it might feel right! The truth of the matter is that people talk like there needs to be this rigid binary, but it truthfully is a spectrum in all senses of that word, and you're allowed to fluctuate on a daily basis! Some days feel rugged, some days feel delicate! Or layer them! I grew up on a farm as a dude, and have some pretty stereotypical masculine stuff going on. But I'm also a huge fan of color, tight cuts, dressing up and letting my ridiculously long hair down <3 I live in a state where it snows, so just the other day I had some slim fit jeans on, a tight paisley shirt with the top few buttons undone, some pink flamingo socks in dressier black boots, and red nail polish! And then I put on a dark brown carhart coveralls and coat, my black leather work gloves, and shoveled the car off and out from a blizzard while my four friends sat inside cause I'M MASCULINE AND I TAKE CARE OF PROBLEMS, THIS WEATHER DOESN'T BOTHER ME GODDAMN IT. The point to all that is like, I get to paint my nails, put on some fancy clothes, be a looker, and that doesn't mean I can't also be that down home masculine I was raised with! \n\nI think painting your nails can be a great start, think about playing with the outfits you put on to include a bit of feminine energy, and if you wanna be a little spoon, gently sweep me off my feet kinda dude, then be that and be confident! Now this is all coming from someone who's bisexual and not afraid to fuck with gender roles for fun, but I'm certainly not trans. If you're genuinely thinking that might be an option, talk to some trans folks! I also think that since you said you're not feeling like you want to be a girl fully, it's possible you're just feeling out of touch with your body, so try taking time to meditate and listen to your body! Just pick out some guided meditations online, look for stuff labelled "Body Scan" and you'd be surprised at what your body has to say about what it wants from you. Being more in touch with how your body feels, moves, exists in the world, can make you more comfortable in it and a much more engaging lover in the bedroom, which might give you that gentle caress feel you're looking for.\n\nJust threw a lot at you, but what the hell are ENFP for? Hit me with questions if you've got em, I apologize for the novel, tl;dr be loose with your definitions and let your body explore itself!
3	All the time bro and honestly everyone is a mixture of masculine and feminine energy. No one is purely just one but society has constructed gender identity to be so. I am definitely both and how I feel vary day to day. Some days I will want to feel alpha and exert dominance. Other days I want my to be small spoon and hold my girl me. I like to dress nice, look good, have people check me out, and get compliments. I've been called gay before since im flamboyant sometimes with how I dress and how expressive I am when I talk. It used to bother me and I tried to contain how "gay" I may have come off. Now I really don't care cause the older you get you realize other people really don't care either. Everyone's got their own problems to deal with. So I hope you continue to grow, the more you do the more you'll find it's easier to be yourself without having to worry what others think. It truly is free feeling when you're not limiting yourself based on what you others might think. 
3	You sound like you may not be completely male. Have you looked into all the genders and genderfluid types out there people have discovered?
2	Yeah sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm not The manliest man but that‚Äôs not a bad thing. Just embrace who you are. There‚Äôs no need to conform to anything. Being you might make certain aspects of life harder but it‚Äôs your life and you have to determine if being true to yourself is worth the added strain of being judged by people who aren‚Äôt willing to understand you.\n\n
2	I like the fact that my outside does not always represent what‚Äôs on the inside. It goes with the old joke of an ENFP being a big mushed up bag of contradictions. I‚Äôm 5ft10, muscly and I have a fair few tattoos, I play in a prog metal band. But I‚Äôm also quite sensitive and perceptive and tirelessly friendly. Which is fun. Because people are constantly trying and failing to guess your next move, as you move erratically through life 
2	I just love mixing it up. I‚Äôm a petite female but have short hair and also mix between the more masculine and feminine outfits. I love when people can‚Äôt label me üòé
2	so many beautiful and touching responses thank you all. I will try to respond to each of you uniquely ‚ù§Ô∏è
2	I feel this very strongly I‚Äôve been fighting with the fact that most of my childhood I would never been seen as a ‚Äúman‚Äù or ‚Äúgirl‚Äùbecause of my outwardly effeminate personality. I feel in so many ways that my personality and soul is female but I resonate and love my identity as a gay male. I also have no desire to be a girl but I want the same reactions as the perfect pretty girl who is desirable 
2	You're nothing but  a meat suit who thinks too much and none of these concepts are real. Now be freee bird. 
2	Does it resonate with you or am I INFP?	Hi\n\nIt takes me a lot of time to figure out which type I might be.\n\nI am quite sure that I am an INFP or ENFP. I suppose rather INFP but maybe what I write will resonate with you?\n\nI am for sure a Fi and Ne user, and for sure more than Si and Te. I cannot figure out the sequence.\n\nI tried taking free some online tests. But depending on mood and day I got various results. On [16personalities.com](https://16personalities.com) I got usually quite high I (though I could get E too...), high N, slightly more F than T and slightly more P than J.\n\nOn keys2cognition I got many different results, INFP, ENFJ, ENFP, ENTP, stuff like that.\n\nIs it possible that I can be an ENFP who is socially-averse or anxious?\n\nHere is some stuff about me. I am sorry for being chaotic but I try to get here as much as I can.\n\nA programmer, male, 33 yo. Kind of sensitive, with weird sense of humour.\n\nI didn't like maths but excelled at it when I was young. But it was too boring so I chose computer science. But I also studied some other things (and came back to computers and programming in the end).\n\nI seem introvert but if I get into a discussion about stuff that I care (especially politics, economy, psychology, etc) I get hyped up and cannot stop talking until everyone agrees with me ;-).\n\nWhen I get criticized it's sometimes hard for me to get back on track.\n\nI tend to stay too long at a given job, sometimes doing some boring dull job, which kills me.\n\nI don't like initiating conversations. And I hate small talk. But I am not sure if I gain energy from people or do they drain me. Ambivert...\n\nUsually I drive slowly. (Guys at r/INFP wrote that the difference between ENFP and INFP compares to a difference between acting like Robin Williams and driving fast vs acting like Johny Depp and driving slow. I usually drive in no hurry...)\n\nI love to make some to-do lists for a day or with some life priorities. The thing is that I don't really use them and I don't have habit of reading them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn general I would buy the idea of me being INFP, whenever I see ENFPs on youtube, they are way more smiling than I am. BUT there are some things that I am not sure an INFP would do:\n\n\- I am not that much of a listener. I saw other INFPs being perfect listeners who really remmeber what people said to them. I can listen, but I quite often drift and meander through my own thoughts at the same time and all I remember is a general impression. I forget a LOT of things by the way.\n\n\- I can take a decision, especially at work, at some meetings where I am with people that I know and we cannot decide, I can construct a plan and say "let's do it so-and-so". In this mode I can be quite hard and composed but it's not my default mode. (Can it be inferior Te?)\n\n\- I am a programmer, so quite often I work alone. But I get blocked quite often. The thing that helps me then is talking to people. I often solve problems when I talk to a fellow "rubber-duck" friend of mine.\n\n\- INFPs are usually aware of their feelings. I am a bit more aware of it lately but I am not sure if it's something natural to me.\n\n\- It's really hard for me to focus. Once I am focused, it can be intense, but I get tired quite fast. That made mathematic courses hard for me.\n\n\- When I'm in a mood of a talker, I put a lot of energy and acting into my jokes. People laugh, even not for the jokes as for the energy behind it.\n\n\- I start things and I don't finish it. I don't finish games, books, movies. I don't care.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think about it? I am sorry for being a bit chaotic, but I wanted to keep my way of thinking reflected here, so you could see how I talk. I usually either talk like I would be meandering between various connected topics (Ne?), sometimes quite shy (Fi?) and sometimes, especially at work articulated and decided (Te?).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am trying hard to figure out my type, because I see that the general advice for INFPs is "go out of your comfort zone!" "believe in yourself, try new things!" while for ENFPs it is usually "calm down!" "focus!". And I would like to know what to do better. Subjectively, I think I feel better if I try to slow down (not that I am fast ;-) ) but it may be laziness as well.\n\nThanks for your patience if you read this and please write if this resonates with you, ENFPs or should I go seeking for myself on INFP subreddit! Have a nice weekend
3	I have heard ENFP's always wonder if they are INFP but INFP's never wonder if they are ENFP. We are the most introverted extrovert after all. But INFP is not the introverted version of extrovert. They have their cognitive functions in a different order and thus think differently as you know. Also to Jung introvert just mean inward and deep and extrovert meant outward and wide. The I and E just means your top function is either directed outward or inward.\n\nThis site is the best cognitive function-based description I've seen: https://www.typeinmind.com/nefi/\n\nThe biggest difference between INFP and ENFP I have found after talking to an INFP guy a lot about this is because they lead with Introverted Feeling they need everything to be personal to them or connected to a value or feeling they have for them to find it important or worthwhile. Then they can run it through Extroverted Intuition to find different ways that thing could be within their feeling framework.\n\nENFP's on the other hand lead with Extroverted Intuition and thus can see all possibilities of things without limit. We don't judge first like INFP's, we perceive first. We see all patterns and connections freely, even if unrealistic. Then, if applicable we filter through Introverted Feeling to narrow it down decide how it applies to us.\n\nI tried doing an exercise with him where you take a spoon (or fork) and try to think of as many other things it could be used for besides for eating. I can name 50 at least with no sweat. A swimming pool for a fruit fly for instance. But he had trouble with it. So I framed it as he was on a desert island and only had a spoon, what could he use it for and then he was able to think of more things.\n\nSo which do you think sounds more like you? More free, open-minded, imagination driven and judge later? Or more authenticity, person value judgments driven and imagine after?\n\nYou can be an ENFP who is mostly alone and at home with no social life. That's what I am. And I had social anxiety disorder most of my life too. But I am ENFP because I lead with Ne. I perceive then judge. I never judge first.\n\nAlso one of the ENFP super powers is our ability to see things from every perspective, to walk in anyone's shoes naturally. We see all the possibilities then filter through Fi, thus we can imagine a situation and how we would feel in that situation. We can understand how someone got to think how they do, even if we adamantly agree. I am not sure INFP's can really do this or as well. They tend to judge first and then maybe try to see other perspectives with Ne but I think it is much harder for them to step out of their own feeling and views into someone els's head. After all they are all bout self-authenticity and hate ever feeling like they are stepping fro  themselves at all.
1	I can‚Äôt quite tell whether you‚Äôre a Ne-dom or Fi-dom from your description but I can vouch as a socially-anxious ENFP!\n\nI‚Äôm talkative when a subject sparks my interest and enthusiastic but my social anxiety doesn‚Äôt care about that and it‚Äôs a health issue for me more so than a personality trait or preference
1	Eh, it's pretty clear for me I'm an INFP just because over time dealing with people do exhaust me and I can 'feel my social battery drain empty'. Just based on that I think you're more introverted than you're extraverted to me. Besides, everyone is technically an ambivert, so please don't bullshit yourself with that iether.\n\n30 year-old-boomer INFP btw.
3	Gotye (ENFx) - Easy Way Out - official video. Relatable?	
1	Why is /r/ENFPMusic restricted?
1	Lyrics: http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Gotye:Easy_Way_Out
21	How do you all act when you‚Äôre stressed out or being abused?	I notice when I feel stressed and/or feel like there is a threat and I‚Äôm feel abused or under attack.... my enfp personality goes away. My open minded, enthusiastic,smiley, silly, bubbly, trusting, and idealistic personality completely changes. I become almost like an INTJ or ISTJ where I am quiet, analytical, controlling, quick to anger, intimidating, assertive, all about efficiency and productivity, and I talk quick to the point. To me, it feels like I go from a feminine nature to a male nature stereotypically. When I am under stress, this shift in my personality helps me get things done and be more efficient. When I am being abused and have to stick up for myself, this personality shift helps me intimidate the other person and to think more logically by shutting off my emotions. It is a protector for me.\n\nAnyone else relate? How do you act under stress or when you are feeling attacked?
7	Yes. Shit will get HANDLED. And lort help the one who steps in my path. It‚Äôs that Te. 
5	LITERALLY THIS IS ME. My weekend was hellish (wedding planning) and 100% became analytical, assertive, etc..... took until today for my normal personality to come back. Is this an age thing? Maturity??
4	Back when I was in my abusive relationship, I wasn't allowed to go out with my friends or generally do anything without that boyfriend. I was scared a lot and coped by hiding, and retreating to my own little world. When I was home alone I'd have some fun with my own projects, but once he got home I was on my toes and trying not to piss him off - you know, for my own safety and sanity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was amazing how much my life changed once I dared to leave him. I got happier, open, spent sooo much time with my friends, and started going out again. Now, I dance several nights a week (swing and folk, and generic parties as well!), take dance classes, play boardgames and drinking games with my friends, have different sexual partners... And I'm so much happier than I  ever could have been back then. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTrauma and fear will absolutely keep the ENFP spirit down and I was not myself. I was easily angry, scared, irritated, would cry at least twice a week, and in a sad way, my optimism is what kept me in that situation. I could see the silver lining in anything. I believed he could change, because we see the best in people at all times. Sometimes, oftentimes even, their best will never be a reality. And honestly, even his best had been merely "acceptable". :') 
2	Yes yes yes I can relate 100%!!!!!! When I get overwhelmed and stressed I turn into an ISTJ, which is what we basically act like when we‚Äôre at our worst.  \n\nI get realllllly quiet, mean, snappy, judgmental, and I feel empty. I feel sharp and nasty, but still really really sad. I glare a lot, and I tend to say really out-of-character things, like quick judgments, nasty commentaries, weird responses to things. I sometimes shake (out of anxiety), and my breathing becomes irregular. I sometimes catch myself almost crying. It‚Äôs just stress to the max and we aren‚Äôt a stressful type, so it‚Äôs foreign feeling to us. \n\nMy boyfriend (who‚Äôs an ISTP), says the best way to get me out of that loop is to give me peace and quiet and to leave me to my emotions and to be alone. I usually calm the fuck down after laying in bed, texting my friends, going on Instagram, watching YouTube, and then my old self is back. I guess I need to reverse back to the things that make me happy in order to cope and heal the bad patch which I fell into. It always works. 
2	Yes this is normal of enfp
2	I straight up break down. I have never been abused but stress is a killer to my mood. I am prone to panic attacks and I get easily irritated. Overthinking becomes a huge issue and I sometimes find myself wanting to isolate myself. Even to the point where I convince myself that my friends hate me and I could stop texting in group chats. Though logically I know this isn't true. I can even lose sleep over it and have a breakdown in the middle of the night\n\nWhat I try do is ask my mom if we can go out whenever I start feeling awful or stressed. It can help lift my spirits a little when I just leave the house. Even for a little bit. 
2	I react very similar I go through everything I know about who I am mad at and prepare a way to bring up their insecurities in a very harsh and direct way or bring up something from awhile ago to anger or agitate them because I feel agitated and feel justified in making them too
2	I have a huge problem with throwing the relationship in the trash for a reaction to validate that they really do care about me
1	i get really haughty and condescending
1	I feel like my sunshine side goes away and the intellectual defensive demon comes out of me. I stop going out, more thinking, less bubbly cheerfulness, honestly I really dislike it but I have come to terms with it.
1	SNLish Skit	Hi! I'd like to make short videos as a hobby and wondered if you guys would like to brainstorm ideas with me! I love when in conversations we get on an imaginative tangent of funny scenarios and thought I could create them in "real" life. Any ideas? They can be random, themed, etc. I'm even open to political/social commentary type ideas as long as everyone is respectful of each other. You'd have to be willing to let me use your idea if you're willing to post it here. \n\nHappy brainstorming!
2	I too want to do this. I want to star a YouTube channel and am pretty serious about it. I am constantly writing down ideas. What exactly are you looking for?
5	how to stop needing attention	hello there my beloved enfp pals. so yeah, basically.... i feel the urge to draw the attention from guys i like (and of those who i don't like also) all the time, it's like i need someone interested in me all the time to keep me entertained and when i'm not receiving any of that i just get bored and obsessed with it for a while..... \n\ni hate this 'cause i know how egocentric this is and i hate the feeling of "needing" someone else's attention instead of being fine just by myself.\n\nis that common in you too? how the hell can i make it stop or at least make it to the point where i can control it
6	Hello! I had the same feeling before and it annoyed me so much because I couldn‚Äôt concentrate on what I needed to do at the very moment so I started journaling and asked myself questions such as ‚Äúwhat do I feel and why?‚Äù and it really helped me dig deep down to my problem of wanting outside validation. Turns out that the way that I was raised during my childhood led me to become a people pleaser. My mom is a very social and a highly likable person and she would go through the trouble of anything just to make others happy. She had good intentions but she also needed to realize that she should take care of herself too. Thus that kind of mindset stuck with me for a pretty long time and I knew that i had to rewire my way of thinking in order to stop feeling like crap all the time when ppl don‚Äôt give me their attention/ validation.\n\nTL;DR All the feelings that we are feeling right now have something to do with our experiences in the past. The best way to deal with them is not by shutting these emotions off or by simply running away from them, we pay attention to these feelings that we have by asking ourselves series of questions that will ultimately lead us to the reason as to why we‚Äôre feeling this way and with patience and consistency, one will know how to deal with these types of emotions. \n\nBest of luck <3
3	Hey! I'm a INFJ-A and I really like ENFP as they are my most Compatible :)\n\nTo me this seems like you have acknowledge a shadow side of yourself, Which is really good! and now you can work on it and become more balanced :)\n\nNot sure if you saw this post but hope this will help! [https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/aii1qu/immatureunhealthy\_enfps/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/aii1qu/immatureunhealthy_enfps/)\n\nHave A Great Day! :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	I felt like this when I was younger and more insecure - I liked having external validation that I was attractive. I still like flirting with people and connecting with people in that way, but I no longer feel like I need the attention.
1	You may have Narcissistic Personality Disorder if it is sup[er strong all the time.
118	Hello fellow ENFPs!

1	Enfp: Psychology vs. Marketing/Management	Hey guys,\n\nJust a quick intro: I'm an ENFP who moved abroad to study Psychology as a Bachelor because I thought I was born to be a Psychologist. A month after the start of my studies, I realised I don't study regularly and couldn't start doing it which made me obviously feel pretty bad. I was calming myself down with the explanation that I'm in a new country and I'm having a lot of new experinces. BUT, now 4 months after the start of my courses, I still do not study because I realised I am simply not fond of what I study \*maybe I had different expectations\* (My subjects are predominantly biological ones and I was never fond of Biology). Although Psychology is theoretically a good job for our personality type, I find most subjects so boring I can't force myself to read more than 30 pages.\n\nI have decided to drop out. The thing is, I'm still afraid that it may be the right degree for me (although I don't feel it at all)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think of changing to business administration and then to do a master which would focus on Tourism (Hospitality)/ Sales/Marketing/HR since the bachelor would give me a broad spectrum which would leave me the opportunity to change jobs in the future if I don't find one challenging enough anymore. The idea of working in tourism, for example, excites me a lot, whereas I didn't feel excited at all as I got into Psychology and starting going to lectures.\n\nI'm still very young but I'm living on my parents allowance abroad, so I can't change too many subjects. I know this thread has been going a long time but: What are your thoughts on ENFPs working in the fields I mentioned?
1	[I/O Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_and_organizational_psychology) might sound interesting to you.
10	ENFP are Divirgent	I think the ENFP type fit the most to the personality type of a divergent (I'm talking about the movie divergent). I think that if I had to do a test to join a faction, I legit couldn't fit into one faction but wanted to be everything at the same time. ENFP are a jack of all trades.\n\nIf you haven't seen the movie yet, I highly recommend it.
8	No, every type is divergent. I think Veronica Roth separated people into factions and drew out the obvious large flaws they have for missing out on another value, i.e. the Dauntless are too impulsive and can't think strategies when fighting and only rely on strength. This is why Tris stands out in Dauntless, because she is Divergent and knows the balance. By the end of the series, I think the message conveyed is that like in real life, everyone has to be balanced and not to trade 'bravery' for hostility etcetera. 
1	The world building of the series made absolutely no sense. It just catered to the feeling everyone wants to relate to and feel special for it. No one watches Divergent and goes "Man, I think I'd be a farmer! I'm so one dimensional!" Everyone feels like they'd be Divergent because wouldnt you know it, everyone wants to feel special. I really dont like that series... *sigh*
7	Wanna turn off Ne for a moment	I wish I could turn of Ne sometimes, it makes my head spin of all these possibilties. And in the end, I don‚Äôt know what would be for the better. Or what the best solution to a problem would be, cause I see 10 different solutions. And for example, I can‚Äôt focus on one career choice, cause what if something else on this planet would suit me better? Then I think I should shift focus. \n\nDo any off you guys ever feel this way? I wish I could have some more Se and actually do things. I know nothing stops me but it doesnt come naturelly for me. I‚Äôm in my head so much right now \n\nI usually love being ENFP but sometimes it‚Äôs just to much. My brain is to scattered. Sorry for the bad english, it‚Äôs not my first language 
3	I'm 29, doing something objectively interesting and meaningful as a career, with a great salary and nice colleagues. I have the exact same anxiousness you describe.\n\nIt's not logical at all, but I contstantly think about changing career path, reconsidering what really matters and gives me meaning. It's unending, and exhausting, and the only break I ever get from it is in the first few years of trying something new. I try to fight it, but maybe i'm destined to be a jack of all trades and a master of none. \n\nSometimes I can trick myself into following through on an idea or change by announcing it to the world (friends and family). Then the guilt of not having done it pushes me to actually make the change.
2	I can relate for sure. I don‚Äôt have a definitive answer for you. \nI just wanted you to know you aren‚Äôt alone on this.\n
2	Focus on Fi for a while. Figure out which of all these possibilities actually MEANS something to you.  Find something that matters a lot and then use Te to DO something about it. It‚Äôs all about the balance. 
2	You need to develop your Fi, Te, and Si more.\n\nDevelop Fi by making more choices. Never be indecisive or say "whatever" or "I don't care" or "you choose." Feel deep own what you feel on something. Even if you like one option a tiny millimeter more choose it. The more you do this the more you will get in touch with what you really want and who you really are  and you will be able to narrow your options down. You'll be able to determine which possibilities you like better, even if it's a tiny bit.\n\nTo develop your Te you should set little goals and try to achieve them. Tiny things. And even reward yourself for them. Get yourself into the mindset of doing things and finishing things to bring success and more things to do. Set bigger goals, then bigger. But keep small goals too. Big goals are made of smaller ones.\n\nYou can also try doing puzzles and other things to practice organization and efficiency. Clean and organize your closet, your room, your house/apartment. Find the best way for things to fit for the space. Find the best way things can go, the fastest, most efficient way.\n\nDoing these will develop your Te which will allow you to be more decisive and action-oriented as well. To be able to put ideas into practice.\n\nTo develop Si you need to learn the value of routine. Doing simple things like washing dishes is a way to relax your mind for a bit and get lost in the simple task of it. This can also help you get things done. Set a routine to write for an hour every day for example.
1	I think I would feel almost hollow if Ne just disappeared. There are soo many possibilities and entertaining them all isn't possible, but I do narrow down the choices and try so many things. I have a career, and I am really good at it, that doesn't mean I can't try all the other things. Ones silver and the others gold kinda stuff. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo for careers though, I just had to decide what was in common with all the different things I wanted to do. Essentially it was solving puzzles/problems....troubleshooting. I wanted to fix things, I really didn't care what it was. So my Dad and I sat down and made folders of all the different technology related majors that would involve a lot of problem solving. I thought wireless technology was rad, so I chose that, it has been one doozy of a rabit hole. Like a tree sprouting, I have my solid base, but all the branches of subjects related going in all different directions, all producing different fruit. Who's to say I can't taste and enjoy the fruit of my labor!
2	Fiction or non-fiction?	Hey all- how many of you are readers and what percent of books do you read that are fiction vs non fiction? :)\n\nI don‚Äôt read a ton, however I really enjoyed fiction books growing up. This past year, however, I tried to fill my time spent reading with more practical knowledge with non fiction books, yet realized I hadn‚Äôt finished most of them :P I just received a fiction book in the mail a couple weeks ago and I‚Äôve already finished it, it was that good!! So interesting pattern there and seeing how you all may relate?!\n\nAlso any fave book or series recommendations? 
2	Maze runner series is great. 
2	SO much fiction, but i gravitate toward auto/biographical non-fiction or non-fiction related to writing/computer science/anything detailing the intersection of humanities + tech in an accessible style! i grew up surrounded with ya novels & i have a special place in my heart for coming-of-age stories. the golden compass is my favorite book series because it straddles so many worlds, literally and figuratively, while still maintaining such a strong emotional core & showcasing complex character development & good pacing. \n\nhowever, i gravitate to auto/biographical non-fiction because i'm still figuring out what the heck i wanna do with my life, and i like reading about what others have done because even though it's daunting, it's also inspiring. writing/cs/hum+tech non-fiction pertain to my fields of interest (which is to say, mostly everything, although i enjoy reading about the ethics of/human aspect surrounding technology + its expansion). 
1	I relate 100% lol. If you like urban fantasy, I'd recommend Jim butchers Harry Dresden files, or my personal favorite, Karen Marie monings fever series.
1	Majority of my books are non-fiction books and self-help books. I prefer non-fiction because I love expanding my knowledge 
1	I only read fiction. Nonfiction is too boring to me. I learn in other ways.
5	Am I the only one who doesn‚Äôt understand the rise in dark/self-depreciating humor?	I‚Äôve noticed these past 2-3yrs, ESPECIALLY on twitter, there‚Äôs been a LOT of tweets where people poke fun at the negative attributes of themselves. Once in a blue moon, it may be funny. But the majority of the time, it‚Äôs just concerning to me. When I see people tweet about their depression, anxiety, and other HIGHLY serious issues about their mental health or their life, that‚Äôs very alarming to me. I can‚Äôt believe stuff like this is considered ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and ‚Äúrelatable‚Äù and brushed off as a ‚Äúcoping mechanism‚Äù ....\n\nI don‚Äôt suffer with any mental illnesses or severe issues in my life but I feel bad for others who do. Whenever I‚Äôm feeling sad or stressed out, self-deprecating humor only makes me feel worse. If I ever find myself relating to the majority in situations like this, i consider that a major red flag and I fix myself immediately. I am a positive thinker and I always use self-affirmations to feel better again. I do my best to maintain a growth mindset and not listen to voices like that. And as an ENFP, positivity and happiness is in my veins. üíñ i never want to feel horrible and I don‚Äôt want others feeling horrible either\n\nDisclaimer: I apologize if any of this comes off as rude or passive-aggressive. I‚Äôm just genuinely curious. That‚Äôs all. I don‚Äôt believe ALL dark humor is bad or unfunny. But self-deprecating humor has always been something I side-eye a lot
6	My roommate and I have somewhat discussed this ‚Äúphenomenon‚Äù.^(do dooo do do do)  \nOne point we came up with is in recent years where everyone seems to get offended by everything it‚Äôs almost easier to make fun of yourself than to make regular jokes that may offend someone else (rightfully or not).  \n\n\nThere‚Äôs a chance that, in general, dark humor has become more humorous to people recently and this is a result/by product. We‚Äôve definitely seen more adult shows with dark humor recently. \n\n\nIt does sound very ENFP-like for your empathy to be front running where you don‚Äôt even have a moment to think if it‚Äôs funny. 
4	Yeah... It's definitely a culture that people feel they can relate to other people about but it is something i find to be very enabling for not getting any better... just back and forth of committing a sort of opposite affirmation
4	I think this comes from the rise of dialogue within society about mental health. I definitely thought the same way until I realised ... heaps of my friends really are just... depressed. So I think it‚Äôs a result of people being more willing to talk about their mental health but people without those issues mistaking it for some quirky attribute they can take silly nilly. Plus not everyone can keep a positive attitude like us! It‚Äôs exhausting for anyone to keep that up 
4	I used to be super self-depricating. I started doing it in middle School because I was super insecure and I wanted to beat people to the punch of making fun of myself. It was unhealthy, but people laughed at me and that's really all I wanted in middle/high school. I still do it from time to time. A LOT of people laugh at self-depricating humor. Because of it I can easily tell when people are joking at my expense and I've been complimented on my ability to take a joke. I love dark humor too. Maybe I'm a weird ENFP, but I always laugh at really dark jokes. r/ImGoingToHellForThis is super funny to look through sometimes.
2	I've been doing that since I was in grade school....maybe I was ahead of the curve?
2	Nobody loves looking others humble bragging now, self deprecating humors and posts makes you more "sociable"
2	It is not recent. It has always been that way.  And it is not bad. If you can make fun of yourself it means you don't take yourself too seriously. And as for mental health stuff, keeping a fun, humorous attitude is good. Even dark humor sometimes. It is a struggle, all day, every day. So if you don't laugh you cry.
1	This video explains it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/kVf-lrufj-s
1	This makes me think of Emma Chamberlain 
45	Two? Sometimes one.	
12	Lol please give me a week and I'll be bored of ya!
6	Sometimes I don't even need to have a conversation ..
6	But how long were the conversations?
2	THIS.  IS.  ME.
1	Not good at typing others: How can i tell if my BFF is ENFP?	he doesn't like personality tests,  so he doesn't want to take the test.  We are so incredibly similar,  but also very different.  i love him tons and want to know what his type is :)\n\n(im INFJ)
2	Tests are unreliable anyway. If you learn the 8 cognitive functions you may be able to tell which he lesds with and his 2nd and thus his type: https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/if-youre-confused-about-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-read-this-an-intro-to-cognitive-functions/\n\nAnd check this description based on cogntive functions: https://www.typeinmind.com/nefi/

25	ENFPs + logical manipulation	So this is something I feel like I don't see represented too often among ENFPs, or at least not openly discussed. Personally, I frown on manipulation of any kind when it's for the purpose of pure personal gain to the detriment of another person, or blatant lies, or just generally withholding opportunities from another for yourself. That said, I also feel like I have the ability to be occasionally manipulative when dealing with more logical/day-to-day issues?? Like once you get to know people's personalities pretty well, you begin to understand how you need to interact with them in order to produce the most ideal outcome for all parties, etc... especially with people in positions of authority. (EX: Currently working on a show with a painstakingly detail-oriented director; most likely ESTJ in my estimation, and he tends to get extremely anxious about the progress/status of things. Unfortunately, I forgot about one conflict I have with a rehearsal and so I had to tell him this while causing minimum damage/rage pencil-breaking. I figured it would be best to do so after updating him on a bunch of production details that were well underway and on track before I broke the news. It at least kept a bit more calm.) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess this could also apply to how one deals with lots of different kinds of confrontation, or people who push blame out, or what have you... i don't know. I guess it's a case of applying knowledge in a colder fashion than I'm used to seeing ENFPs do other than myself? If that makes any sense. Anyway, that's all. Anybody kinda relate?? 
14	There is a difference between being machiavellian and being persuasive. I know in my past i've stressed over whether I'm a bad person because I thought any *manipulation* of others was bad.. My idea was that all we have is our agency and to assert my will over others is to rob others of their humanity. This mindset didn't end up working for me, believe it or not, lol. \n\nAnyway. Effective communication is important everywhere you go, and different strategies are needed depending on the setting and the people. Its not manipulation to know how your boss ticks, its just being smart.   I always recommend the book "Getting to Yes" to friends who want to be more assertive, and is helpful in dealing with a myriad of issues beyond work related negotiations. 
9	I relate to this in a few ways.\n\n1.  I have learned to strategically lose some battles in order to win the war. Let people have their little victories, feel like a winner, tell them that's why they get the big bucks, then circle back when there's something you really care about at stake.\n\n2.  To win an argument present a good-looking exit. Your opponent fights 10X harder when there is no avenue of retreat.  Beating someone into submission with your logic / moral superiority / peer-reviewed sources DOES NOT WORK in real-world applications (are you listening INTJ's?). When challenged and in defense mode MOST human people react with emotional escalation and counter attacks. Sometimes you can persuade a rational minded person but that's not common.  Instead of trying to crush someone in an argument, compliment them, reassure them, thank them for their insight and walk them to their exit, where the red carpet is rolled out to their waiting limousine.  Metaphorically speaking.  A little bit of graciousness allows people to save face and show themselves out. Now you're the coolest guy in the room, instead of just being a smart asshole
8	We can be manipulative, but in a sympathic way. People don't really know they get taken advantage on because we do it in small doses. By our way of conveying people might trick people into being better friends than we are and that can suck.
6	There are two reasons for this. \n\n1.ENFPs are high in emotional intelligence , meaning we see and understand patterns easily and quickly. \nAnd that first intuitively before articulate . But we are good at acting on our intuitive abstract knowledge. \n\n2. We are opportunistic . We love people and live goodness for goodness sake. But if our values aren't directly attacked we still go after what we want if we have an opportunity. 
4	I think being adaptable and knowing how to work with multiple personalities is a useful skill in life and work. I think you're misusing the word manipulate here or you've painted the word manipulate in a sinister way in your own head. Getting the work done on the best manner that keeps everyone happy shouldn't be seen as manipulative. It's like a coach trying to get the best out of his players during practice esp when they're getting lazy. You wouldn't think that coach was manipulating his players to practice harder because that would be the wrong term to use since he's trying to motivate them and being out the best in them. That's how I see it but we all have different definitions of things on our heads. 
3	The first time I can remember learning this type of lesson I was about 6. There were a few board games my brother and I liked to play but we needed three players. I learned if I asked my sister to play with us because we needed her she would almost always say no. If I presented it to her as an opportunity, ("we're playing this game, you can join us if you want") She almost always said yes!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's weird watching people do what you want without even realizing they're sort of being tricked. I never do it for malicious means, but I do get a bit of a thrill from it......
3	I am not ENFP but once you learn the signs you see this behavior in pretty much all ENFPs and to a lesser extent all _N_Ps.\n\n1) It has to do with sensing\n\n2) It specifically has to do with extroverted sensing.\n\n3) It has to do with extroverted sensing being a weak function in all _N_Ps\n\n4) But all _N_Js and _N_Ps have extroverted sensing as a weak function, what is different with the _N_Ps is that it is a shadow / subdued function.\n\n5) This in turn makes the Se feel like pressure that is not beneficial pressure even when in moderation it may be beneficial, but key word moderation, and just put a little more pressure than the moderation and suddenly it is no longer constructive but instead the opposite it is detrimental.  What is constructive and detrimental is different for each person, and with _N_Ps pressure Se is rarely helpful and almost always detrimental.\n\n* Aka this is Yerkes Dodson https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerkes%E2%80%93Dodson_law\n\n * [Image 1 to supplement wikipedia](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vitor_Gomes7/publication/281620803/figure/fig1/AS:391510043447300@1470354676339/Yerkes-Dodson-Law-that-illustrates-a-possible-relationship-between-anxiety-level-and-task.png)\n\n * I have more great images I can't find right now.  I am putting this here merely to vent. =P\n\n6) Now EN_Ps and IN_Ps are different.  One of the differences is how much is self generated vs external generated (introvert vs extrovert) and giving an EN_P lots of pressure without giving them the "tools" they need to succeed will quickly build up resentment in the EN_P.  An EN_P will need Ne and Si in the right amounts in order to deal with complex and not simple tasks.  An EN_P actually needs more feedback from the environment, inspiration with the forms of ideas, and concrete-sensory-***information*** but ***not*** concrete-sensory-***pressure,*** in an enviroment when an EN_P is doing a complex task.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n7) Now all of what I said above is true, but there are additional layers once you layer the strong Feeling component, and the strong Fi / weak Te (but valued Fi and valued Te) component onto all of this.\n\n8) This in turn means an ENFP is very resentful of "manipulation", lies, personal gain at the expense of another person's personal gain or the group's gain, with-holding opportunities to others for the gain of the self, and so on.  An ENFP due to their feeling component does not see this as "objective" manipulation but instead "subjective" manipulation.  What I mean by this previous sentence is THIS IS  NOT A GAME, this is PERSONAL, those people you are manipulating have selves, they have subjective experiences, and your game is hurting another person and is making them subjectively feel horrible and this is a horrible thing to do.  You may not feel their subjective senses like anger, frustration, pain, sadness, etc ***directly*** but these people are still feeling those things that your GAME is causing and this in turn makes you an asshole and [skips a 50 page rant on assholes and the cruelty of people who do this.]\n\nWell the combination of Shadow Subdued Se combined with Valued Strong Fi causes this reaction in ENFPs.  It is something all _N_Ps feel but it is strongest in the _NFPs and it is triggered in slightly different ways in the ENFPs and INFPs when and how they get angry by this\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Anybody kinda relate??\n\nYes I can relate even though I am not your type.  I understand it for I have different experiences than you but I had enough similar experiences to recognize this behavior is never acceptable, even if how I came to this understanding is different than most ENFPs.\n\nBut I am not sharing all my life story for two reasons.  1) This thread is about you =P  2) I suck at sharing it for I do not know how to share it and be concise or I share it concisely but it is cryptic and the other person often does not understand.  It is not a story that is easy to share after all.
2	Yes. ENFPs are experts in social maneuvering. I think we usually use it for good. have found this skill to be particularly useful while working in jobs where the clients are behaving badly. It‚Äôs easy to read people and figure out exactly what tone of voice or casual comment might throw them off their ‚Äògame‚Äô enough that they snap out of their condescending attitude. \n\nFor example, at one job, I would be friendly, bubbly, open, etc. as long as the client didn‚Äôt try anything. I could always tell as soon as they underestimated me and tried to get slick or pushy about regulations or wanted to break the rules. As soon as they started, I snapped into all-business, no-nonsense FEDERAL REGULATIONS, and IF YOU WANT YOUR MONEY YOU WILL PROVIDE THIS AND THIS DOCUMENT types of interactions. They usually got over themselves in a hurry. BAM. Completely polite and respectful after that. \n\nAnother position I had was in health education, providing some routine training for doctors and nurses, techs and other hospital employees. Some of them were disgustingly condescending and overly concerned with our degrees, even though most of us had as much or more education than most of them. They tried to pass off their little power plays as innocent small talk and some of my coworkers fell for it, unless I overheard. NOT TODAY, SWEETIE. You can easily allow people to set their own traps and push them right into it with a smile. One lady had this horrible attitude like, ‚Äúoh my GAWD, YESSS I know everything already, I‚Äôve been doing this for TWENTY years,‚Äù acting like we couldn‚Äôt POSSIBLY teach her ANYTHING. So I helped her along: ‚Äúoh wow, yeah you probably know all of this. Go ahead and walk us through it!‚Äù And she‚Äôs like ‚ÄúYEAH OBVIOUSLY!‚ÄùüôÑ OF COURSE, she did everything wrong and backwards and upside-down and I just watched her fumble around for a while until she was sufficiently uncomfortable and marinating in how wrong she had been. Then I swooped in to save her. BUH BYE HONEY, hope you learned something today üòáüòáüòá So smooth. 
2	Quick story of my ENFP coworker... I can't remember the exact circumstances, but he sort of owed me a favor, so I jokingly told him his job for the day was to keep me entertained. Throughout the day, he kept mentioning former coworkers of mine - people who had left before he came, so he didn't know them, but he did it very naturally, giving me the opportunity to reminisce. I had no idea he was doing this on purpose until later he told me he was doing it because he knew how much I enjoyed the nostalgia. \n\nThat was over two years ago, but it really opened my eyes to how easily some people can pick up on little things like that and consciously apply that knowledge to affect someone else's mood. It's pretty cool, but a little scary to me and made me rethink some things.
1	for me I see this as,...Gift of Persuasion, that can be used to inspire and persuade others to do good\n\nor\n\nyou can use it to manipulate others for selfish gain\n\nI have used mine for both!
1	I have an ENFP female employee that works for me and I'm an INTJ. She has 2 modes, outright manipulation when she is not getting from me what she wants. This usually ends very badly between the two of us as I detect it immediately and call her out on it and she will deny it. Yet she will persist in a modified tactic and try to pin me in a corner and she is very skilled at it. This could be for her own benefit, the group of employees  she feels needs represented or an individual.\n\nThe second way is what I call advocating. She has a cause that she believes needs to be represented and articulates it's importance. It is well presented, logically thought out with several avenues of rebuttals for any objections. She is persistent as a bad habit. \n\nAs soon as she walks into my office I ask her who or what is she advocating for now. She lives up to her type that is for sure and she doesn't even know what type she is because she didn't care after taking the test. However the INTJ ENFP communication dynamic is there and we get alot of things accomplished and make a good work team as long as she is honest and not manipulative.
3	Is anyone else intimidated/fearful by very dominant/masculine/alpha men?!	Is anyone else intimidated/fearful by very dominant/masculine/alpha men?!\n\nWhen I‚Äôm around masculine men who are dominate, very\nLogical and not emotional, barely smiling, very serious, seem to anger easily, super assertive... I get so intimidated, fearful, and feel helpless around them. I feel less in control of situations around these types of men and maybe it‚Äôs because they often like to call all the shots and control others. And I don‚Äôt like that. Plus also I am not used to these types of men as the men in my family (brother and dad) are pretty soft, emotional, passive and let me get my way most of the time. \n\nI wonder if it‚Äôs related to my past trauma for me to be fearful of these types of men because their nature it makes me feel less in control. And feeling in control has been a coping mechanism for me to feel safe especially from abusers. Also I think I noticed that in order to protect me from my abusers in my family, I had to become this masculine and powerful version of myself. So maybe I can intimidated by these types of me because I‚Äôm like, ‚Äúwhoa, you men are the real thing. You were what i became (to a certain extent) in order to protect myself.‚Äù\n\nI feel safer around softer men and calmer and like I can relate to them more (probably because we are both feelers and emotional) and I‚Äôm used to this type of man. On the other hand, I also notice I feel attracted to dominant men especially sexually and also how they are often assertive, ambitious, and they can protect and stick up for me instead of me always sticking up for myself. But I also feel like I don‚Äôt know how to have a relationship with these types of men because I‚Äôve never been friends with people like that. And I don‚Äôt know how to interact with them. Sometimes I‚Äôll act really serious around them because I think that‚Äôs what they want? It‚Äôs like I feel like they are so different from me. Then I feel anxiety around them like I have to please them and not make them mad. Also, since these dominant men are so overpowering, it scares me because I know if they are toxic individual, they could use their dominating power to really hurt me. Which is what happened when I was sexually harassed 2 years ago. \n\nBut I also have this fascination and attraction towards them. Perhaps it‚Äôs that natural inclination of people wanting polarity in a relationship‚Äîsomeone more masculine and the other feminine. I think I‚Äôm an ENFP so I would say men who are like ENTJ intimidate me.\n\nI‚Äôm confused about whether these types are men for me as my body is telling me conflicting things. \n\nAnyone relate?
6	From my experience, the lower men are in a dominance hirarchy the more likely they are to become "toxic" and abusive. They get resentful and need someone weaker to let out their anger.\n\nThe very serious ones often have a well integrated shadow and there's a reason why your instincts make you feel attracted to them (higher dominance), though you said "seem to anger easily" so I guess we're thinking about different type of dominant guys because those often only have uncontrolled testosterone overflow which is garbage.\n\nAlso, most of the time they don't want someone who's as serious as them but a more emotional and expressive one because of being serious and outwardly cold all the time it can get very lonely and gloomy inside so it's good having someone warmer as some kind of mental support/replenish.
5	A true dominant, masculine, alpha male will not make you feel uncomfortable but safe and secure. That's the primal attraction part simply because of evolution. We don't get to decide those feelings.\n\nJust as a man finds a woman with the ideal dimensions of bearing children attractive even though she has a shitty personality. We don't get to choose those primal attractions.\n\n
2	My bf is an ENTJ and he is one of the most patient and sweetest man I know. Like genuinely sweet. I had an ex who was INFP and turned out not to be as sweet as I would have expected during arguments. Even threw something at me and hit me at one point. Don't let things like astrology and mbti lead on your opinion of people. I think you should probably first get some therapy because you deserve to be heard and to be healed. Second I would say trust your intuition and go slow. It takes a while to truly get to know someone. 
2	What do you ask yourself before you make a big decision?	I usually go with my gut feeling or imagine what I would do in 5 years looking back. \nWhat about you guys? 
2	I don‚Äôt and that‚Äôs my biggest issue!
2	YOLO
1	Dwight says it best: "Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, 'Would an idiot do that?' And if they would, I do not do that thing."\n\nHaha... Jk. I still do it about half the time. 
6	Any ENFPs bipolar ?	Hello all my lovely people! Do any of you have bipolar disorder? How did you know that this is the disorder you had? How are you sure that it was a disorder and not just your personality? What steps did you take to get help? What are routines that you find helpful in managing manic and depressive symptoms? I have just noticed that many ENFPs wonder if they are bipolar, and so I‚Äôm wondering how many of us of actually been diagnosed. If so, what has helped and what experience has led you to seek help and get the proper diagnosis?
2	Hey! I wonder this a lot. I have a family history of bipolar so that also confuses things.\n\nI have seen a psychiatrist who says I could get a diagnosis for cyclothymia if I wanted (mild bipolar), but because I'm so high functioning he doesn't think I need it. He also offered Lithium! 8|\n\nIt actually helped a lot to recently find out I was ENFP, and to hear that others have the same suspicions (so thanks for your post!). It's a relief to realise that i'm not alone and that I don't need to worry too much about being mentally ill. \n\nI love the ups, and the friends I have because of my gregarious personality. The lows I try to manage with exercise and meditation, and travel also helps to get me out of my current context, and get some perspective on my 'problems'. But I've only had mild success with this.. the lows still suck balls.\n\n
2	Anyone playing Elder Scrolls Online (Europe Gateway)?	I am sooooo tired of annoying NT minmaxing nerds in this game, so I've set up a guild with ENFP name in this game. I am not much of a leader and it's just an empty guild but damn, this game needs something like safe space for ENFP and INFP people, when we're safe from judging and min-maxing while still be allowed for out tourette-like syndrome (in good faith, always). So please either pm me to join or pm me to release the guild name for someone with better organizational skills :)
6	Since writing this post, I have fallen in love with being an ENFP. For the past year I've been focusing on learning to be balanced and spending less energy on Ne and more on Si, as well as accepting the downfalls. Open to questions :)	
6	Would you guys be interested in a post like this one? Where I go over how I've tackled a lot of these challenges I've had? 
5	Lol couldn't even bring myself to read your original post. Too negative for me. I'm glad since that post you've been able to shift your paradigm. Removing the barriers we place on ourselves is so liberating. 
3	ENFP-A(M). I found this interesting, and I relate to a few things. Like being a feeling guy is bizarre to so many. I have often been called not masculine and often called gay(nothing wrong with being gay), because I feel everything. I was at an Art exhibit and talking about a painting with my friend and his wife. The conversation eventually built up so much emotion that I just busted out crying, it was beautiful. But I am often looked down upon, for these expressions of emotion.  \n\n\nOddly I have never felt like a side-kick unless I put myself there. I have had many mentors in my life, and find the dynamic useful and productive. When outside of this dynamic though, I feel more like the Doctor, from "Doctor Who." I see so much and make so many connections, that I move more and hesitate far less than others, puts them in the situation that they need to keep up.  \n\n\nNow professionally I found my ability to learn quickly, make connections, and use Te's practicality is a super power. I. Can. Troubleshoot.\n\nSeriously, I can troubleshoot so well, I am better than some of my co-workers who have been in my field longer than I have been breathing. Now, designing an environment and putting together the needed paperwork....I struggle with, but that is why I use interns, they learn, and do the work I do not excel at.  \n\n\nI really relate to feeling like an outsider. The only time I don't feel like I'm too big for the frame is with my childhood friends, 2/3 are fellow ENFPs. Seriously though, It is like everyone is worried about what madlad thing we are going to do. So I show them some vulnerability, ask them some odd questions they have never been asked, and all of a sudden I am a danger or something. I can talk to anybody, professionally, casually, playfully and generally each party in the conversation is pleased, but so many of my friends are terrified of what I will say. To quote a friend, "Every time I see you raise or reach out your hand to someone, I am terrified of what is about to happen." Do they not know that I get along fine on my own everywhere else? That I am a professional in IT and have to give security presentations to massive companies?! Bah Humbug. On the other side of the coin, when I was told these things, I stifled myself for their comfort....Eventually I get, "It isn't the same going out with you anymore, It's like you lost your spark." I blew up. Promised never to do that again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo we are different, and the world isn't designed for us. We don't have to live their way though, secretly they wish they had the potential energy we hold at  all times. The very things that they complain about are things they envy. We are heroes, they are the sidekicks, and they know it. See every angle with Ne. Find your Fi and never stray from your values. Let Te do the work, Te loves that stuff. Si....just eat, sleep and clean...when you get a chance. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope you find company in my words.
2	Voice 1\n\n>I hope you're happy\n\n>I hope you're happy now\n\n>I hope you're happy how you\n\n>Hurt your 'cause forever\n\n>I hope you think you're clever\n\nVoice 2\n\n>I hope you're happy\n\n>I hope you're happy, too\n\n>I hope you're proud how you\n\n>Would grovel in submission\n\n>To feed your own ambition\n\nVoice 1 and 2 together\n\n>So though I can't imagine how\n\n>I hope you're happy right now!\n\nI am just checking something with you ENFP.
2	I would love to hear how you get more balanced! I‚Äôm so sick of my Ne right now, it‚Äôs running wild and I can‚Äôt seem to focus. How do you use more Si?
333	Being an ENFP is basically oscillating between being Tigger and being Eeyore.	
102	Completely true. Have you ever seen the movie Tangled? The scene where she gets out of the tower then bounces between "Best day ever!" And "I am scum..." is my daily life. Lol.
35	Can confirm. In person, definitely Tigger. Alone on social media, Eeyore.
31	Yes. So true! In winter I feel very Eeyore. The sun shining or not shining directly affects my mood! Bahhh! Here have an upvote!
16	Strangely accurate. \nIt gets 10x worse when going through a rough breakup with me. \nFrom \n"I want to kill myself everything sucks.."\nTo\n"I want to kill everyone with my happiness, I love everybody!!"
17	Aww...and can this INTJ be a Christopher to our ENFP Tiggers and Eeyores.\n\n Someone needs to walk beside our sweet Pooh Bears.\n\n&#x200B;
8	So true
7	That sounds exhausting.
7	i'm the opposite. Tigger around my family and friends, awkward eeyore (kinda?) around everyone else.
4	I like both üòâ. INFJ 
4	Definitely for tiger, but my Eeyore isn‚Äôt....sad? Just exhausted.
4	YES. And sometimes you are both at the same time, and it is so very overwhelming. I was basically Eeyore for 6 months, but I finally feel like Tigger again and I'm so grateful.
10	You mean bi polar? Cause that's the oscillation betwixt those two characters.
3	Hahahaha omg.... This is so freaking true
3	In my notification bar I thought it was Ti and Se, but now I'm even more impressed. I'm at work and i literally yelled "OH MY GOD!" because it's so trueüòÇ
3	Why must our emotions do this to us?
3	Hopefully not. Being ENFP doesnt mean you go from being joyful and hyper to straight up depressed on a regulair basis. That would be exhausting.
3	Same. Oct-Dec I was Eeyore. Just sad: wake up sad, anxious, go to bed sad. And lonely. Misunderstood. Unwanted lalala.\n\n For two months now I‚Äôve been Tigger. Explosive love for people, life, love. One or two bad days. 
3	Nah can't relate tbh.
2	Fuck
2	YEP!
2	Wow lol this is pretty spot on
2	Hahaha. Amazing. Yes.
1	Eh who are they?
0	Is this an enfp?	Would an enfp put only solo pictures in colourful clothes with subtle poses on social media focused on her with barely any background to cover which kind of seems self obsessive? Or do you think it's another type?
6	Every ENFP I know, myself included, never posts solo pictures.
1	I post selfies if I‚Äôm feeling it ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è With that said it‚Äôs more than likely going to be travel photos - food, landscapes, buildings, nature etc. Of my entire instagram probably a third are of people and a third of those are selfies/photos of just me. \nI personally find social media where it‚Äôs just the person and no real variation really self-absorbed. 
1	I do this. But that's because I have no friends or social life. And I like colorful clothes.
2	ENFP in search of themselves	Hello! Honestly, I just recently registered on this forum, and I realized that there are so many people here with similar problems. I thought maybe you could give me something about my situation, now I will tell you everything.\n\nI am an ordinary guy, I am 22 years old, since the last classes in school I could not understand who I still want to be. I played on a saxophone player, I can't say that I love it very much, although I liked playing in the orchestra. But I knew that this particular money was not earned and decided to choose a different path. Since childhood, I was well versed in computers, although I think it was more skill than some talent, everyone told me, go study to be a programmer, you have talent, but no one then knew what programming really is.\n\nAnd I went to the university to study for a programmer, and you know, I was very sorry because of this, it was terrible learning, I could not do much, especially algorithms and mathematics, I thought that I would not graduate from the university and even nearly crashed a couple of times out of it, however, my communication skills helped me negotiate with everyone to solve these problems. I then realized that I had chosen the wrong path, that maybe I have another talent, another job that will give me more pleasure.\n\nAt the end of my studies, I settled down as a manager for the sale of CRM systems, I made this decision because I passed the test and realized that I was an ENFP, and there they were offered some specialties that included sales. I thought that I could communicate with people, why not try it and go. You know, I really liked the first time, but sales were cold calls, most of the day I had to call people and offer services, I kind of liked to communicate, but cold calls began to tire me terribly, I began to hate the phone, I could not call and had to leave ...\n\nThen I chose the path of a real estate agent, I thought that there would be more human contact there, but the basis of this activity is also the phoning of clients and the entry of real estate into the database, everything is not what we imagine about this job, I am warm from the last I don't know what to blow and what to choose next, where to go! I can not tolerate these offices, I get terribly bored and a lot of routine does not allow to breathe, please, maybe you can find some advice ...\n\nOf the great talents, many are telling me to write books, I know how to inspire people, once I was leading and it felt like not bad. I can speak beautifully, I can infect people with many of my ideas ..\n\nI really need your advice, friends, help!
1	Have you ever thought about entering politics?
2	ENFP - INFJ Frienship	Tell me about your enfp-infj friendships! I'm an ENFP and one (ha! too many friends) of my closest friends is an INFJ. I feel our friendship seems pretty accurate to what I've read online but I'd love to hear about others' experiences!
2	hey there!! i only know about one of my friends who is an infj and we have a wonderful friendship and connection. we're like not the closest friends (i met him at uni, then he quit and now we see eachother sometimes) but since the beginning we had a bond. he's just, like, SUCH a nice person with everybody and even though he is shyer than me, he still can bond easily with people around him. besides HE'S SO CUTE. i want to hug him all the time.\n\non the other hand, he doesn't share his feelings with everybody and even though we don't see eachother often, he normally picks me to tell me about sensitive things about his life (past and actual lovers, family issues, general trouble). we have a super chill true and healthy friendship and i'm really happy that i inspire him the confidence to tell me about his feelings <3\n\n
2	My little sister is an INFJ and she is the sweetest, cutest, funniest little creature I know, we have so many inside jokes anyone who heard us talk would think we are crazy, she is the best to be around, I feel like I can be myself, actually my extra-super-own self with her,and she is as well. we can talk about anything she knows she is my bestie and mocks that my bestie is my sister, but thats how it is XD,\nI'll actually send her a screenshot of this answer and she'll love it, let me know if you have any questions 
1	He's cool. Too tired to write more. 
289	Just saw this and created an account so I could share with you guys <3	
27	Love this. Someone once said don't fall in love with potential... I really needed that that day :) 
21	I like this but I also somewhat disagree. I want to work on myself until I'm at a point where I make others want to work their way up with me.\n\n"Come up, the view's breathtaking, you'll see. It's worth the trouble."
40	[deleted]
10	What does this really mean? How far should I go? I love self improvement as much as i love helping others, and I love debating as much as I love echo chambers, but it seems like this is saying 'keep going because other people have not got to your level yet'? Also, since typing that, I feel like 'yet' is a bad word when talking about these things, in the same way that anything that 'should' be felt and is 'expected' is wrong, like blanket statements or blind expectations.
16	I'm just... not that interested in myself.  Or in people who are interested in themselves
8	Yeah! Fuck those people!
3	But what if I love those people and want to inspire them?
6	I like the emotional trainwrecks. They're the ones who create the best art and music. 
2	Yep that‚Äôs the key
2	love this 
2	Spot on advice with spot on timing. Thanks for the advice.
2	So needed to see this! 
1	Preach!!
1	I‚Äôve just followed her on Twitter!
1	No rescues.
1	Cool..

5	What is your favorite movie?	Mine is Gummo! I LOVE that no matter how many times I watch it, I notice something I hadn't noticed before, or interpret something differently. \n\nI love the cinematography, the dark vibe, the whole aesthetic pretty much. \n\nI want to know what other movies ENFP's enjoy! It is almost scary how relatable all of the posts in this sub are. 
3	Mine is "Midnight in Paris."  The scenery is just so beautiful and the music, omg :) The story is great especially when he winds up back in time to the 1920s and 1890s.  It is just a perfect movie to me.
3	there will be blood. the landscapes, the pacing, how it was shot, the characters, the lessons, the conflict, the performances, the music, its all amazing. 
3	The Truman Show.\n\nAlso Mrs. Doubtfire, Meet the Fockers, and the German film "Feuerzangenbowle" are some of my favorites.
2	Few of my favorites: Pride and Prejudice, The Big Lebowski, Casablanca. \n\nUnrelated to those, I also love most anything sci-fi and dark & twisty psychological thrillers. \n\nI like this question. I feel like we should ask this about books also. I'd be fascinated to hear some responses. 
2	Back to the Future. I've seen it probably 1.21 gigillion times.
2	As a self proclaimed movie nerd, Alien is the only perfect movie ever made. Absolute fact, no opinions here. But my favorite? Ooooh man tough one, I'm just gonna say most of Chris Nolans films, they're so expertly crafted its hard to look away.\n\nHonourable mention goes to the Lego movie, coz its awesome and the whole thing is basically ENFP personified.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: All Nolan films barring dark knight rises and interstellar. Both were pretty meh to me. If you want one recommendation, I'd say its the Prestige with Memento in close second.
1	Gone Girl, Storks, Paddington 2, Mission Impossible 6, Christopher Robin, Shawhank Redemption, chef, and anything that makes me cry or laugh
1	Romeo + Juliet, Encino Man and Cry-Baby. Bit of everything!
1	The big lebowski
3	Forgiving Self	Is it just me or do you find it easy to forgive yourself when you know better but when you did not know that you were supposed to know something, it is like pulling teeth to forgive yourself?\n\n&#x200B;
4	Have you ever been to Puerto Rico???	I impulse booked a trip leaving this Saturday and IM SO EXCITED!!!!!! Hoping this will kick my seasonal depression in the ass!! üòÖüòÖ\n\nHas anyone every been and do you have an recommendations?? We're staying 2 nights in San Juan, 2 nights in fajardo, and 5 nights on Culebra üòÑüòÑ
4	Ah, hope you have lots of fun!! üòä
5	I haven't been, but I thought about going! I heard there's a bioluminescent bay on Vieques island off Puerto Rico :) \n\nHave lots of fun!
1	INFJ children with ENFP parents or vice versa	
107	boyfriend of 5 years response to marriage. How does this make you feel?	
160	I‚Äôd laugh. This is funny. These kinds of text messages deserve this response. Save serious conversations for real life. 
54	Honestly, it sounds like you guys are already married!
43	I like him..
31	My perspective, clearly he hearts the fuck out of you and the idea of marriage with you is a good thing to him. Seems to be a playful exchange from him that should be considered endearing and heartwarming.  \n\n\nThat being said, I dont know how your two's dynamic works. 
20	That level of honesty is a good sign. Congrats!
17	This sounds like he loves the shit out of you! Honest use of humor is the best sign of comfort 
9	I'm so happy for you two ^ ^
7	He‚Äôs the GOAT lol this is hilarious 
5	Hahah mine is ENTP
3	My husband still responds to me like this 
3	Keeper.
2	A Reddit award?!?! WOW!!!! Lol, you just made my day! THANKS, friend!! Cheers to married texts and ENFPs!! :-D
2	Haha yeah good stuff :)
2	LOL..:This is something my ESTJ husband would say
2	Am I engaged? \n\nLmfao
2	ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
2	Honesty is sexy AF!
2	That's hilarious. I get it, because some days I really annoy the hell out of myself, too. ü§£
3	I'm pretty much your bf in this scenario with my SO. I also joke that I will divorce him if he doesn't stop farting on me. I love him dearly and don't want a life without him in it. I do think marriage is just a government interference into my love life so it's really not as important as the quality of my relationship. 
1	As a female ENFP I feel like this would be my response to the question. Mostly because I‚Äôm sarcastic and love to joke around. But, I understand from your side how it could make you feel nervous I guess. We overthink other people‚Äôs words/actions way too much. 
1	This is amazing. 
1	I think it's joking and in fun. But on a serious note relationships aren't always equal. Some days are harder on one than the other and one has to carry the burden. It's not always 100/100. Sometimes it's 150/50. I read a really good thing about this once but can't find it. But if you can bounce back and still appreciate each other it is working well.
0	He sounds like my boyfriend. There was a time this type of response would hurt me deeply but after two years with a INTJ, I'm used to this type of reply.  If you guys are talking about marriage, his sense of humor can't be surprising to you at this point. He's rude for sure but at least he's honest. When you think about this question yourself, don't you have to admit you don't feel 100% head over heels every day about him? At least "most days" is better than "some" lol\n
0	UPDATE: I was messing around , throwing him for a loop but also pushing the subject a little. \n\nI saw him in person and asked so must days huh?! Jokingly .. \n\nHe said, ‚Äúyeah, with the way you act day to day what do you think?‚Äù\n\nWtf?!
-7	Honestly this would annoy me.  I would feel like he would know what I was getting it but was trying to deliberately avoid the central issue and talking about it.  I guess with such a serious topic I would want a straight answer, not dancing around it.  Also after 5 years, I personally would be like... bitch where's my ring? lol.  Like seriously though- I would be thinking, if I wanted to get married earlier, that it wasnt all that compassionate or kind to me to let it drag on so long without an engagement. 
3	Has anyone taken the Gallup strengthfinders personality test? If you have I‚Äôm curious what are your 5 strengths? Mine are strategic, connectedness, includer, ideation, and woo.	
3	I did the High5 test (I googled "Gallup Strengthfinder free") and got optimist, believer, coach, storyteller, empathizer. I don't know how/if they line up, but I liked the test I took!
3	Mine were  Empathizer, Brainstormer, Optimist, Chameleon and Storyteller. If they are in order from highest to lowest, i kinda disagree with the order but that depends on daily basis though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Googled "gallup strenghtfinder free" too
3	i got empathizer, commander, coach, peace keeper and self-believer. its so me it hurts. im kind of confused with the last one but maybe, deeeeeep down, i do believe in myself more than i think üåà
2	I love the Strengthsfinder. Mine are:\nStrategic, Connectedness, Positivity, Communication, Empathy.\n
2	Empathizer, Catalyst, Deliverer, Thinker, Believer
2	Mine are: Restorative, Positivity, Individualization, Empathy and Woo. Quite typical ENFP!
2	Coach, empathizer, problem solver, peacekeeper, catalyst 
1	Thanks for responding! I‚Äôm curious how the stengthfinder themes lineup with MBTI. 
1	I got optimist, coach, empathizer, strategist, and self-believer :)
1	When I took the free version empathized showed up, but when we did the full version at work it didn‚Äôt make my top 5. I have includer which I assume is similar.
29	RANT: What is with the idolization of ENFP-INTJ relationships on this sub??	Seriously guys, there are other types! Why do I see three posts a day about this?? Yes I understand that novelty is attractive to us, but INTJs have A LOT of issues and also often really do not get us. \n\nI‚Äôm not saying these relationships are bad but why the hell are we idolizing them? Why is there no attention given to other relationships, especially those with other Fs? \n\nI for one am two and a half years in with an INFP and it is much more happy, rewarding, stable, fulfilling, and healthy than the passionate-but-maddening INTJ and INTP relationships I‚Äôve had. \n\nHaven‚Äôt we all realized by now that idolization is a major issue for us? Especially in relationships?\n\nLook guys, I‚Äôm just saying there are other types out there, many of which will understand you and see you for who you truly are better than any INTJ who‚Äôs in it for the novelty. \n\n
6	It is the noble illusion, the noble utopia above the vanishing line of the horizon.  There is a reason why ENFP / INTJ relationship types are called the mirage / illusionary.  For they are pretty.  But at the same time you can't eat your ideals / illusions / mirages.\n\nIt works some of the time, and other times it is a disaster this utopic thinking.\n\n(see follow up post.)
3	I agree as well.. \n\nAs an ENFP, myself best friend being an INFJ she really understands me well and we share a really special connection that's hard to get with friends a lot of the time. I have another friend (relatively new), who is "supposedly INTJ", I do sometimes doubt as he isn't as "cold" that stereotypically we are told they are... he's definitely some of those INTJ things but more friendly and smiley?? idk I still contemplate is INTJness. Anyway, I've never experienced the same level of connection with him.. I don't really talk to him much, and our convos are short and not really filled with depth as I hope I would.. maybe we have the inability to open up with each other... I really don't know.. But I can say for sure that just because we are made to think ENFPs and INTJs should generally have this automatic connection and attraction between each other isn't always the case. \n\nFollow what your heart feels <3
3	I support this rant!  \nHonestly, I have trouble with J's... 
3	Lol I was just going to make a post like this! I really don't get it. So many posts and memes and videos and questions about INTJ-ENFP relationships. I really don't understand why anyone would want to be with someone so different. All the things people post seem awful to me. I don't want to be with someone who sees me as a crazy mystery thing and who is stubborn and not creative and free and completely open-minded like me. Right now I am in a relationship with an ENTJ girl and I know it is slightly different because of stack differences but it is similar enough I think. It is often hell. We argue constantly and don't agree on anything. I want to be with someone like me! :/ Ideally another ENFP.
3	Kind of off-topic, but I'm actually wondering what happened to all of the ISTP/ENFP talk. Back around 2010, I joined PerC and that was all I ever heard about. There were ENFPs posting almost daily(seemed like it) in the ISTP sub-forum either asking about their ISTP partners or wanting to know more about us. It got to the point where they started getting trolled because a lot of the ISTPs thought they were trolling us. \n\nThen I come here 7-8 years later, and its all about the INTJ/ENFP. That's a new one for me.
4	[deleted]
2	I prefer other extroverts to be honest, but INTJs are aiight. 
2	Went on a date with an INTJ and I think he was just checking off the "ENFPs and INTJs are good relationships" and didn't give a damn about me personally, which is something I've seen a lot. (Also it's pretty shitty)
3	I noticed this too.  INFJs are actually the more ideal partner for ENFPs while INTJs and ENTPs are ideal partners.  \n\nENTPs and INFJs are supposedly the golden pair but we definitely don‚Äôt idolize one another and often butt heads.  \n\n
1	The love of my life was an INFP actually. It was many things, but healthy it was not. I think maybe because we were both young. I never made her feel secure. She's now with somebody (type unclear) who can basically devote their life to holding space for her melancholia, something I'm unable to do. Not saying all INFPs are like this, but that undeveloped examples of every type will have their blind spots. I'm not saying I won't date an INFP again. But I'll be on the lookout for the surfeit of feels and lack of action and organization.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think a lot of the canonical ENFP-INTJ problems comes from undeveloped types who are aware of the attraction but unable to meet in the middle. I think the crux of the attraction is actually that we are very different but ENFPs and INTJs really do get each other. We embody the unrequited dimensions of each other's being while sharing a similar, but opposite, view of looking at the world (Ne vs Ni).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, it is known that there can be a match between any type if both individuals are well-developed. I'm just saying ENFP-INTJ is not a bad place to start. 
1	Jacky my cute INTJ I miss you ;_; 
1	Yeah idk, I‚Äôve tried dating all of the INTJ/INFP/ENTJ/INFJ/ENFJ/ENTP and my boyfriend now is INTP (so is one of my best friends) and I feel we get along better than any other combination, by farrrrr. Perhaps because I‚Äôm more of a T and he‚Äôs very good at F stuff too, and we discuss literally everything you can think of but also because other non-personality stuff like our goals and many other preferences are highly in alignment. 
9	Wrote A Poem About My ENFP Best Friend. Maybe you guys will like it too! <3	If you have any other ideas or maybe some constructive criticism, lemme know :)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nAlways on the run, we've got no time to dive into any river. \n\n\nWe move like gypsies beneath the moonlight, away from every winter.\n\n\nThere's so much to dream and fantasize about!\n\n\nWe'll be dreaming together until the stars come out.\n\n\nEnchanting dreams about faeries and unicorns, hobbits and trolls\n\n\nAnd leaving the country on a quest for treasure we read about in scrolls.
2	So short but so catchy. Really caught that bubbly happiness we have. Keep writing man this is good :)

11	Does anyone else often struggle with arguments because you feel the other persons "vibe" so much that it feels like they're right, even when when you actually think they're wrong?	Like, you don't actually agree with the other persons argument but you can almost "feel" their side so much that it feels like you're wrong/they're right? For this reason I find it hard sometimes to argument back, and I lose my train of thought and can't reply with a good argument.
12	That‚Äôs one of the ENFP superpowers in my opinion; the ability to see both sides. Many people are rooted in their own view but we have the ability to put ourselves in other people‚Äôs shoes and understand where they are coming from. I am a mediator and I love my job because I think it is such a privilege to hear how people see the world and what is important to them.
5	You poor ExFp creatures for both ENFPs and ESFPs have this from time to time due to function order reasons.  It causes a form of FEELS that feel like hurt but not hurt (caution is the more accurate descriptive word in describing the behavior externally, but internally it FEELs like confusion, frustration, hurt but not hurt, mental discomfort, stress) in the ENFPs while the ESFPs power through and often ignore this caution.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNote all types feel this from time to time, it is a human thing.  Links to two articles about Cognitive Dissonance and Motivated Reasoning.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning\n\nBut ENFPs due to having a perception function first, and two judgement functions in slots 2^(auxiliary) and 3^(tetriary) are more familiar with this feeling being active instead of "behind the scenes."  Now being an EN_P vs an ES_P makes it feel different, and also being an IN_J vs an IS_J it feels different, and also a J user vs P user it feels different (specifically a dominant leading Perceptive Extrovert vs Perceptive Introvert.)\n\nAll people feel this, but I think ENFPs and ENTPs feel it the most, in my subjective opinion, this war against themselves.\n\n*You poor things, you poor unfortunate souls*, ***in pain, in need***\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi58pN8W3hY
2	With our Ne and Fi we can see every possibility and know how we would feel in any situation. Thus we can easily walk in anyone's shoes and know how we would feel in their situation. We can see how they could have arrived at heir views. It doesn't mean we agree at all, just that we understand how they can think that. But the key is to not let your understanding get in the way of how you feel and your views. Just because you can understand how someone could be racist given their specific upbringing, etc. doesn't mean you should agree or tolerate it for example.
54	This video reminded me of an ENFP-INTJ relationship.	
9	We work well together ‚ò∫Ô∏è
4	Channeling some strong r/exnocontact strength after watching this one. I enjoyed [the original without the music as well.](https://vimeo.com/196527198)
4	That made me cry.
3	When they're in the cart and she looks back at him and says "We got this" with her eyes?! It's so perfect!
3	I enjoyed that video.
3	Haha it was kinda sad at the start but this reminds me so much of my INTJ because he seriously has the worst luck and I always try to see the positive side of unfortunate things that will happen to him to try to brighten him up 
3	Can I just say, that this video is greatness üòÅ 10/10 would watch again. 
1	Yes, ANOTHER ENFP-INTJ Relationship Question. Sorry.	Hi, peoples of ENFP Reddit!\n\nJust recently started reading up on personality types and so I'm still learning some things, so bare with me if these might be questions you guys get all the time on this subreddit.\n\nI'm currently in a long distance gay relationship with an INTJ. We've known each other online for about over a decade. Started out as close online friends at first, and a few years ago decided to give a relationship a shot since I've always been very enamored by him and to him it seemed like I was the only person who he could trust, who was honest, and that accepted him for who he was and didn't push him aside like a shit ton of people have throughout his life though childhood up to then. Since then, we've clashed a lot on certain things, but we've had such fantastic and romantic times too. Last year I finally got to meet him for the first time irl, spent a week with him and it was the most romantic time in my life so far.\n\nWe've recently been talking about our personality types a lot and from what I've researched with INTJs, is that they really have trouble opening up about their feelings sometimes. I kind of have known this for years with him. It's not that I don't think he loves me. I know that for a fact, just as much as I know for a fact the sky is blue. His actions speak that every day to me when I talk to him. How he helps me with things I struggle with, how he helps me when my emotions get out of hand, how he's always been there for me though all this time, how we bond together, and he tells me he loves me everyday too with his sweet soft voice, which just makes me swoon. Ahhhh! <3\n\nWhat he's told me though is that once you know you're an INTJ, there's no turning back. In a way, I would like to see him express his feelings a little bit more. He told me he's always felt like that he'd just be hurt and backstabbed if he opened up his heart to others.\n\nUnfortunately, he's had way too many experiences to where that was the case with others. I'm one of the VERY few people in his life that didn't and never would in a million years.\n\nHe's lived with severe depression a lot in his life and he felt that later on if he just closed himself off, he'd be better off. You really don't wanna know the hell he went though to make him come to that conclusion. \n\nBut, is there a way for him to open up more? Would it help him in the long run for his mental and emotional well being if he did so he wouldn't be so depressed like he usually is? If you're INTJ, is there really not a way to do it more often or is it possible to do so in some way that would be good for him?
2	Don't force it. He will come around when he's ready to open up. Probably he's already doing it for you bit by bit. Just being there and listening to what he says is enough.\n\n> If you're INTJ, is there really not a way to do it more often or is it possible to do so in some way that would be good for him? \n\nWell, if you happen to have one of those "deep" conversations or moments where you are having an open forum of some sort, you can take advantage by asking questions you are curious about (those that he doesn't normally answer openly). 
1	>But, is there a way for him to open up more?\n\nSure, but you have 0 control in it, and it won't happen of he doesn't think he needs to. \n\n
1	Skips long winded explanation I was going to write to explain WHY this happens and instead focuses on what you should DO.\n\nThe reason for this is Si is a valued function for you ENFPs while Si is a shadow / subdued function for an INTJ.  We will never be able to make our chaotic / daemon Si into an organized thing.  It is just the way we are built.  Trust me us INTJs find our chaotic / daemon Si mighty frustrating and we can often wish-cast and wish we were a different way for a brief moment, or in certain things...(skip explaining more for I am trying to be brief.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut there is an internal logic to our Si, there is a way our Si is useful, not all is lost.\n\nBut we are built differently than different types.\n\nStop trying to organize the chaos, it is unorganizable.  Rejoice in the fact it is unorganizable by an ***outside active source,*** rejoice for it is organizable by the enviroment itself by passive means.\n\nGive your INTJ good experiences, help him find enviroments where he can simultaneously be himself but also be challenged and this challenge will help him develop new skills.  He needs to be introduced to new enviroments, enviroments he feels safe in, and these enviroments have something that he can "work with" instead of being a passive "observor."  Something to do, something to activate him, so his arousal is medium not too low and not too high, the task has complexity but not too low and not too high, and there is positive consequences that are immediate by performing this medium arousal and medium complex task.\n\nGive him lots of these experiences.\n\nAnd then from time to time when he is already in a good mood, a contempt mood, where he is just sitting back in bed, or on a couch, remind him of those things and remind him he had fun, he had joy during that moment, or let him also remember the other emotions like frustration, anger, sadness, suprise, disqust, pride, exhaustion, envy, etc.  Let him be free with his own memories, and he will re-contextualize and color those memories via the mood he is in now will actually seep through to his memories and bring order to the chaos.  It doesn't take much but it works.  Note though an INTJ only needs a little of this stuff from time to time, think of it as a ritual with dieting where you have a diet but you also have a weekly cheat day where you eat that chococolate ho ho.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4Fk8tkgAQPc?t=43\n\nINTJs need to feel melancholy, and we need to feel specificity, but feeling both of them at once in complex spaces exhausts the INTJ, but recombining the experiences later in a non stressful place where we are already feeling content and passive joy for we are happy, it is here we can recombine the melancholy and specificity together and feel nostalgic joy ***even though we INTJs are not creatures of nostalgia like you ENFPs.***  We need a little nostalgia to organize our chaotic Si, but too much nostalgia is not helpful and can make us passive aggressive, but the right amount works.\n\nWe INTJs are built for the painful and sad nostalgia and that makes us great anticiaptors, it makes us great systematizers, it makes us great forecasters, but we also need a little joy in our nostalgia as well.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKEBrMV-sdM
1	Don‚Äôt push it, hes aware of what you want and is working on it atm anyways. He‚Äôll probably never reach a normal lvl of feeling expression, but the fact my enfp best friend doesn‚Äôt push me or need me to open up is one of the reasons she‚Äôs my best friend. 
1	Weekly Support Thread	\n/r/ENFP has always been and will always be a place that lends an ear. Large or small, get it all off your chest. In this corner of the internet, you will be heard. We are here to support one another. We are all we have.\n\nThis doesn't replace the individual posts; it's just another avenue to start talking, MBTI related or not. Sometimes you need to check in more than once before you feel restored. That's what we're here for.\n
6	Emotions	Does anyone ever feel emotionless at funerals and memorial services? I usually cry by myself or with someone I'm very very close to, but those ceremonies usually feel so fake to me and I just shut off. Anyone else feel the same way or am I just weird?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited for clarity.
2	I am this way. It's actually really weird. I always just thought it was because Im a Nurse and have gotten use to death. I will cry in my own but during the service I will just kind of sit there, half checked out. 
2	Very, though public displays of emotion is something I've struggled with my whole life. I can always keep myself together if I need to, and I prefer to express my feelings to close friends or alone rather than be observed by strangers. Idk, its just uncomfortable. So at funerals where the expectation is to be emotional, its very hard. Meanwhile its such a downer that my brain tries to cheer me up by making jokes, its a struggle. \n\nThe most recent funeral I went to was for a friend's dad. I knew his dad decently well, was bummed he was gone, felt worse for my friend though. Outside of connecting with him once where I really really felt his pain, I was mostly just awkward. 
2	I've been to a couple family ones and barely cried. Then I also went to a sister in laws boyfriends father's funeral, never met the guy. Cried my eyes out. 
14	ENFP and ‚Äújust friends‚Äù - reaaallllyyyy?!	Hey ENFPlers,\n\nLet‚Äôs be real - how often do you actually text someone all day almost every day for 8 months, want to see them when they‚Äôre in your country, and generally just maintain CONSTANT communication? Texting songs, poetry, funny memes, as well as more serious convos over the phone? \n\nI‚Äôm talking about at 36 year old male ENFP.\n\nINFJ (33F)  here, and I‚Äôm running out of energy. Particularly that we used to be a ‚Äúthing‚Äù but he didn‚Äôt want to commit, and now 5 months later he still gives all this attention!! That is even in the brief moments when he‚Äôs seeing someone else of course. But those never last longer than we did 8 months ago which was 3 weeks... (his decision to not pursue anything serious).\n\nNow I‚Äôm considering whether or not to just cut him out of my life. Don‚Äôt get me wrong - I‚Äôm ok being ‚Äújust friends‚Äù, but to me he is BSing himself and me, cause THIS amount of communication is just not normal outside of romantic relationships.\n\nReally curious to hear your thoughts/experiences.
17	He likes you, but doesn't want to be pinned down (for a lot of possible reasons that don't ultimately matter). As you said, this is something you have to decide if you can live with or you're better moving on... Easier said than done for many of us.
8	>Texting songs, poetry, funny memes, as well as more serious convos over the phone?\n\nI do these things with friends and view it in a non-romantic light\n\nCertain friends I text most days but not necessarily every day or having ‚Äúconstant communication‚Äù like you mentioned\n\nAre you interested in enneagram? I wonder if he's a [sexual variant](https://www.eclecticenergies.com/enneagram/variants). I'm a sexual variant first and self-preserving second. People tend to list their dominant and secondary instinctual variants (sx/sp, sx/so, sp/so, etc.)\n\n*All of that aside*, I would recommend confronting him about it, telling him how you feel and trying to reach a compromise. But it's your call if you want to cut him out of your life
7	Yes that sounds like being set up as a back up plan to me. Which is not cool, you are plan A, not someone's plan B. \n\nYou won't be able to stay friends though, at least not for 2 or 3 months. Otherwise he will still think he has you on his leash. I only say this from personal experience, trying to stay friends RIGHT after romantic interest or involvement is like emotionally cutting. \n\nand you cannot say you are leaving for a while, have to just start being busy, not responding as much, etc
5	Sounds like he likes you enough to want to chat all the time but not enough to want to seriously date you. Or he might just have an avoidant attachment style. Or both. However, I honestly think that distancing yourself or cutting him out is a wise move if you're having trouble moving on. That said I've occasionally had friends who maintain constant communication, but it usually only works if both people feel 100% platonically towards each other.
5	If you need to establish sanity checkpoints or set up protective forcefields do that for yourself. But if I can project, boundaries are probably not a male ENFP's jam. You may feel negative about being "strung along", but if he likes you he likes you, whether it's "going somewhere" or not. From his point of view, your relationship is a positive, whatever the official status. If that's hurting you he needs to know that, because he's not trying to hurt you.
3	Criticize him about it. Call him out. He's probably oblivious to how it's upsetting you to the extent that it is. Usually ENFPs are responsible with their Fi so if you criticize him he will probably seriously self reflect and even act appropriately so it doesn't cause you any stress. This is best case scenario. Worth a shot. \n\nDon't know him so can't speak on his feelings but... He probably really enjoys you as a person,does not want to lose the bond,but has his reasons for not wanting to re-establish a romantic relationship. 
1	What is the problem? Because you are annoyed that he contacts u too much, or that he likes you when he is in another relationship? 
1	I can relate to this. I find it very difficult to not know where the ENFP stands because him giving so much attention makes it hard to not give that many attention back. But I could use my time in better ways maybe and it makes it so much easier to know if the relationship is going somewhere or not. It‚Äôs frustrating and confusing.\nI‚Äôm in the same situation with a 25 year old male ENFP but he also talks about not being ready to get into something serious. So maybe it is because they are into you but indeed have reasons to not be pinned down. I‚Äôd rather have that they make up their mind and make a decision, for our sake. 
1	I don't really think he is BSing. We may seem flirty but we are completely oblivious about it. He sees you as a very close and special friend (sorry if that word hurts) and doesn't wanna lose you, no matter how old you guys are and what has happened between you two. I know if i were him i would try to keep in touch with my best friends and tell them serious problems i have in day to day life. \nAbout him not wanting to pursue an actual relationship, it's just the way he sees it. You can have really close friends that would make perfect partners, but you simply can't see them more than friends ._.
1	I'm in this exact situation with an 25yo ENFP girl for the past 8 months. Very confusing. We're way too good at flirting with each other.  And that's too much fun! \n\nDefinitely am a plan B.\n\nAt this point we have kinda sorted it out. She's my best friend and we are tremendously close. But at the same time I'm going to a lot of dates and she is helping me find a girl I like.\n\nI've never had a friend so close in my life. And I think perhaps... her as well. So we can't afford to lose each other, I think. 
1	I agree. Our generation tells us that it's not dating that it is just talking. But, I don't think so. Why? B/c constant attention from the opposite sex can cause one to mistaken the motive and often leads to one person having feelings for the other. 
1	Based on your other comments. I think this person might be an ESFP. I know this doesn‚Äôt help you though. I think this guy sounds like he needs to get his shit together or you need to cut him off. His behavior sounds like some ESFPs I know but doesn‚Äôt sound like anything any ENFPs would do. If you don‚Äôt like being FWBs with him then stop. 
1	There are some things that fit outside of the Myers Briggs and enneagram tests. Regardless of how this individual perceives the world, and interacts with it on a categorical basis; they are not treating you right.\n\nYour responsibility is to bring it to their attention, and to allow yourself to let go of your attachment to this person. Attachment and love are different things.\n\nI just recently went through a divorce, and I've been berating myself for not having sex with her after we split, I've been berating myself for not telling her *one more time* that if she just apologized for cheating, if she just promised not to do it again, if she just TRIED then I would try too. I've been beating myself down because *I* didn't do enough. I didn't fight enough. I *wasn't* enough. \n\nI've started establishing boundaries with her. I've decided to not offer any more chances. I've decided that 27 "oh I just don't knows" is enough. When someone is leading on, you know in your heart. Trust yourself. Unless you're an s, in which case idk, what does the empirical evidence tell you?
1	Just because he didn't want to be in a relationship doesn't mean he diudn't want to be best friends.
1	He likes you and in his mind he is not leading you on. At least it‚Äôs probably not his intention to do so. I‚Äôm i a similar situation where I‚Äôm your Enfp. But it‚Äôs with an Istp. We can‚Äôt see each other cause we are on different continents right now, but we used to have a fling and we both fell for each other but we have not really talked about it cause the timing is shit. In my mind, even if I could not be with him, I still wanted to maintain contact. Even if I could not have him as my partner, I still want him badly in my life since I like him, so I tried to talk to him as usual and sending him songs and stuff. I think he couldn‚Äôt handle this or the distance since it would not lead to anything. He kind of tried cutting me off, so I respect that and stopped writing to him. It makes me sad but it‚Äôs probably for the better. Him cutting me off made me realize how much I actually like him. He still writes to me from time to time but it‚Äôs on his terms which annons me. You guys just work differently. But try to cut him off and see what happens. You do deserve someone who wants something long term with u.
0	Hahahaha welcome to the life of dating an ENFP. My mom says she always feels bad for any girl foolish enough to date me haha. now that I understand things a lot better I know what she means and I feel for you. As a fellow male ENFP who does this, I would say it's best to cut him off for a couple months and see how he reacts. With the space, he may finally decide if he wants to pursue this or let it go, but if you keep talking to him, he might keep on dragging on for who knows how long. 
1	Feedback on ENFP male	Hi all - female INFJ here. (Sorry if this sounds childish or over dramatic!)\n\nAbout eight years (when I was in high school) ago I went to school with this guy. We never really talked much (I was pretty shy back then, embarrassingly so) but I felt he was the only one who really saw me. Once, when our school went on a field trip, I was alone on a bridge, feeling alone lol, and he came up to me and asked me if I was okay. Of course I said I was fine. Later when I broke my finger in a cafeteria accident he gave me a latex glove with a finger cut off.\n\nThe next year, some girls told me that he wanted them to tell me he liked me. I didn't feel the same then, I didn't know how to respond at all so I didn't. Over time though, I developed feelings but it was too late to do anything about it because he was leaving school.\n\nWe messaged each other a couple times, then lost touch. He got into a relationship, then got out of it. Once when we ran into each other, he said that it was a mistake.\n\nWe ran into each other again in another state (it had been three years since high school) and unfortunately my feelings grew more. I mistakenly thought he liked me and was single since he put a flower in my hair and acted super friendly and I ended up telling him I had feelings for him, but it turns out he was seeing someone else at the time. He was nice about it though and gave me a hug and said goodnight and when I left the next day he asked how I was doing.\n\nA few months later his relationship ended and we started talking. We talked about travel, all sorts of ideas, and he once said when we went someplace together we could pretend we were on our honeymoon, lol.\n\nIt had been a little over a year since we started texting (we live in separate states) and I hadn't talked to him in a while since I went to a depression program. I tended to not text him right away (maybe once a week or twice) because I didn't want to bother him.\n\nBut we started talking regularly again after I got out of my program in July (I didn't tell him about that) until October. During that time, he asked me what things women liked (I suggested poems, nighttime picnics) and then asked me if I liked them, told me that I sparked his imagination, told me I was "a special gal, ya know?", asked me what romantic/sexual things I liked, and asked me to "go out with me sometime". But then he also talked about cuddling because we were friends. We also talked about meeting each other over Christmas.\n\nThen he stopped texting me. I looked at his FB (I didn't have my own at the time) and there was a profile picture of him and another girl). I was suspicious but I thought hey, guys can have gal-pals, so I tried to forget it. Closer to Christmas, I asked him if he was still planning on meeting me, and he did. He made breakfast together and went for a walk and talked. He was surprisingly serious (he's usually very bubbly). He left and said he had a good time and that was that. But after he left, I looked on his FB again and his cover photo was of him and his gf, kissing I think (I tried to block it out, lol).\n\nI was a tad livid after that. We never talked after that (he posted on FB in March that he got his contacts deleted).\n\nIt's been three years now, and I've come to two conclusions. Either he was playing me or using me for a back up, which didn't seem at all like him, or he didn't like conflict and didn't want to hurt me so he just played along and avoided it.\n\nI still get upset every once and a while, but I've mostly healed. I'm in a pretty good place and I've forgiven him, which has given me peace for the most part. I'll always care about him to some extent.\n\nA few months ago (I got a new FB) he sent me a friend request. I accepted it, but we haven't talked. I'm in a relationship now so I don't think it would be appropriate to talk to him (I would like to ask him why he did what he did).\n\nI also found out recently, that on his FB profile he had been in a relationship with her since July, before we stopped talking in October. \n\nI guess I would just like some honest feedback from ENFPs or people with a bit clearer view on this. There is still a part of me that would like to be friends with him (he's the only one I've ever really connected/at home with), but I probably shouldn't. It's possible he's just being a zombie too.\n\nSorry this is so long! Thank you for reading :)
3	It sounds like he was into you. But also I don‚Äôt think he really did anything wrong either. Other than maybe flirting with you while he was (maybe) with his current GF. To be fair, he even said y‚Äôall were friends. Although cuddling seems a bit over the line. I think he liked you but probably he didn‚Äôt know how you felt. He was probably hoping for you to do something back. And maybe you did, but he just didn‚Äôt get the hint. Maybe it‚Äôs a case of the girl being too subtle and guy being too oblivious. Maybe he was too scared to really make a move? Maybe he wasn‚Äôt sure how you felt? It sounds like he tried really hard and then gave up, he probably thought his efforts were fruitless. Maybe I‚Äôm making assumptions though. \n\nSince he was in a relationship at the time that you said you liked him, it meant he couldn‚Äôt move forward with anything with you. Later when he broke up, perhaps he was interested in you but didn‚Äôt know if your feelings had changed. Or it‚Äôs possible that he really was just using you as a backup to boost his self esteem. I can‚Äôt tell. But if you started texting him less during that time, I can see why he‚Äôd get the impression that you changed your mind about him. So maybe he thought ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs a bust‚Äù and went looking for a girl somewhere else. He apparently did meet someone. Then you started texting him more often and he became conflicted. He probably liked you still but didn‚Äôt know how you felt which is what I addressed in the previous paragraph. \n\n\nIt sounds like you‚Äôre upset because you feel like you were led on. For instance, he flirted with you and then you saw a girl on his Facebook. But if he was under the impression that you only wanted to be friends, then theoretically he hasn‚Äôt done anything wrong.  I mean the flirting on his part may be wrong if his GF considers it cheating, but as far as he knows, you see him as a friend, so what‚Äôs the harm? \nOf course you liked him too so that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre upset by that... which is understandable. It does hurt. \nAm I on the right track about this or have I misunderstood you? Lmk what you think. I mean you say ‚ÄúI‚Äôve forgiven him‚Äù, but what have you forgiven him for? Having a crush on you and then not having a crush on you? Am I misunderstanding this? Not trying to sound rude. \n\nIt's hard to tell what he was thinking because I don't know his character, but these are some possibilities I can think of: \n\n* He was just flirting with you for the hell of it. (not nice)\n* He was saying things to you to see how you reacted to then, as a kind of experiment. For instance, he says something risky to you first and then if you respond well, maybe he says it to his GF. This *might* explain why he was asking you so many questions about stuff that women like. It doesn't explain why he made it personal after asking you the questions. \n* He was trying to get you to confess feelings for him again because maybe he was considering leaving his GF for you. People don't really work like that but maybe he didn't know that lol.\n\nConsidering that he was super serious when y'all met over Christmas break, I think that he wasn't just "using you". He probably felt guilty, or awkward, or nervous. Like he made plans to hang out when he was in a flirty mood but then three months later he regretted that he had made the plans. If he really was just screwing around then I doubt he would have been so serious when you actually met. He probably would have flirted even more. But that def sounds like an ENFP when they know that they've gotten themselves into a pickle and are trying to fix a situation that they've screwed up. So I think he has at least a decent respect for you. 
2	I think you should accept his friend request. Friends from high school are hard to keep around and you both have known each other for this long? That's something very special to keep! I don't know if you can have that with any other person, as of now. I believe it's the people that understand you and stay with you that are worth keeping.\n\nWho knows? Maybe somewhere down the line, you'll end up together again, because you both know and understand each other more than anyone else.\n\nI don't think he was using you, though not liking conflict and avoiding definitely seems plausible. We mean no harm and don't tend on hurting someone's feelings. I think for guys, we like to have choices just in case things don't go well and something to fall back on. It'd be much harder to move on without it.\n\nI had this problem as well trying to choose who I wanted to be with, but a teacher I was close to simply said "*One at a time."*
7	So this site says the biggest con to dating an enfp is we "too intense "	https://www.yourtango.com/2019320833/pros-and-cons-falling-in-love-each-myers-briggs-personality-type\n\nYou guys have any opinions the too intense thing. \nAnd girls out there that like enfp guys, you think that is true, or do you love us being intense? \n\n\nThe site also says we can't sit still and need constant stimulation, but that makes it sound that our mate has to always be trying to amuse us, but we are pretty good at amusing ourselves I think, we are always finding stimulation in everything haha now sitting still... Who wants to be a statue anyway,  I guess it means we are always looking for new things to do, but I would count that as a pro\n\nUpdate: I posted this cause I wanted to hear your guys opinions and thanks for them it was very informative! , at the end of the day, there are some characteristics that we may need to pay attention to, and some that are just who we are and the person that's right for us will love them aswell .\n this comment I attached is specially great to understand the purpose I had when I posted this\n\nRecognize the ways that you might be too intense ...\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/aio91a/so_this_site_says_the_biggest_con_to_dating_an/eepkces?utm_source=reddit-android
19	Then you should find someone who wants to date you instead of finding someone who wants someone less intense than you. And be able to care for your own needs
14	Too intense isnt a bad thing if you're also radically honest.  Also being stimulating and looking for stimulation is great as long as you can also know how enjoy silent moments.
6	Recognize the ways that you might be too intense relative to others expectations. Do you message first and last every day? Do you always ask the questions? Do you always respond quickly while the other person takes some time to respond? Are you always planning the next date and are there many of them every week? If so, slow it down. You might be coming on too strong and making the other person feel pressured to be something they're not. \n\nOur need for constant stimulation is also potentially reflected in this. If you are bored and ask a potential interest a question, you are using them as a stimulus to fight boredom. Which in itself is fine if done from time to time, but it creates a habit over time of seeking their attention whenever you are bored. Then when you aren't bored and don't default to seeking their attention, it can seem as though you've changed and taken less of an interest in them. People will also be concerned that when they do have your attention that they don't have it fully, because you are always looking forward to the next thing and aren't living in the now.\n\nAlso the idea of always looking for new experiences sounds great to some types, and sounds flighty, inconsistent, unreliable, and uncommitted to others. \n\nBe happy with who you are, be aware of what makes you different, find someone who appreciates your charm, don't change or demand others change just to be in a relationship. 
3	Hard to say unless you're right in front of the person in question. I've also been told I can be "intense" and it's hard to understand what this means sometimes. Better to be yourself though, intense or not.
2	Some people find intense overwhelming, others find intense attractive. Also yeah ENFPs do need attention cuz we (or at least most i've seen including myself) start feeling left out and go into hyper overthinking. However I'm 100% sure it isn't anything along the lines "GIVE ME ATTENTION 24/7 OR I WILL HAVE DEPRESSION ;4;. Like you said, we can stay alone and still have fun. To be honest I can't find any reason not to date any type, since it's all subjectivity. I think xSTJs might think xNFPs are too irrational and all over the place while an xSFP or even an xNTP would see them as interesting and fun to be around. 
2	The reasons to not date an ENFP is an uncountable number, a myriad of reasons, a "wan" of reasons.

1	What does that even mean? Feeling too much? Caring too much? Being too passionate about things? Being high energy too much?
5	Constant quest for the perfect relationship may make them change relationships frequently	It is still quite mind puzzling how perfect some ENFP descriptions fit me. I have always been quite sceptical, yet when discovering this, I knew I was an ENFP. 
1	Yes totally agree. 
1	What do you think of this song ?	
1	sounds like a mix of Twenty One Pilots and Hobo Johnson. So real and viceral (whatever that word means). damn, this is god. 
24	Immature/unhealthy ENFPs	I see a lot of clashing opinions about ENFPs on MBTI forums a lot. I've heard all the stories about us being fun lovable puppy dogs but I was wondering if any of you have experienced unhealthy or immature ENFPs in your life. Being an ENFP myself, it's easy to understand them and how their mind works however it makes it no less frustrating when I see their patterns of behaviour. It can remind me of how I used to behave sometimes and I'm glad I've took the time to grow and develop my inner world and values and my awareness of the world around me. Here are some key traits I've noticed in my unhealthy/immature ENFP friends:\n\n* Self absorbed (note: not selfish): I think this is a common factor I've noticed in my unhealthy/immature ENFP friends. Their actions aren't selfish by default, I think self centred would be a better way to describe it. This is because they usually aren't aware of the issues around them, and when they are confronted they often feel bad. I'd probably put this down to Fi. ENFPs can be very focused on their own identity and values and what's right for them, that they can often overlook the situation around them. For example, not picking up on certain social cues or indicators that suggests someone else may be uncomfortable with what they have just said or done. Another example, if I were to come to them with a problem or something that bothered me they may respond with "that's shit :( but don't worry this happened to me last week...". I can understand what they're trying to do, they're trying to help me feel at ease (not selfish behaviour) by replacing my problem with one of theirs to make it seem as if I don't need to stress about it (self centred behaviour). And they don't seem to pick up on the fact it makes me uncomfortable or shuts me down etc. I think it's from the Fi, an attempt to empathise. This can be incredibly frustrating because I think it's very important to consider and value other people's emotions but they can't seem to pick up on this sometimes. The self absorbed tendencies can also lead to an inflated ego and delusions of how capable or skilled they are at certain things, or how certain people perceive them (eg the idea that everyone likes them or that their crush likes them back when they don't). \n* Attention seeking: A few of the ENFPs I have in mind can be very attention seeking. It is mostly for the attention directly from other people, and although this can be seen as endearing (often described as puppy dogs) it can be very draining and exhaustive for other people, especially introverts. A lot of my ENFP friends seemed to jump very quickly into new friendships and relationships, bombarding the other with questions and arranging to meet for lunches etc and would pour out their hearts and minds to them without giving them the chance to even respond (unless it was about the ENFP). I have to admit, I do jump into things too quickly. This is down to Ne - we see all the possibilities that this new friendship or possible relationship could go and we want to jump in right away however this needs to be controlled because it can scare them away, or it may just be a bad decision. Sometimes we like to ignore the negative possibilities and just focus on the positive ones, damn optimism. Back to my point about attention seeking... the select ENFPs I'm thinking of will go out their way to gain attention from these people, I've even seen them go as far as posting things on their social media stories, pretending to be upset in the hopes that their person in mind will respond and ask them what's up.\n* Manipulative: Usually the ENFP means no harm. A common situation I can refer to is when they have upset a friend accidentally, for example by saying something hurtful without realising or cancelled plans last minute. When their friend is angry at them and the ENFP feels cornered I've noticed they'll stick with crying and puppy dog eyes in hopes that the friend will feel sorry for them. This is another time where I've seen the sad stories being posted on social media in order for that particular friend to see. \n\nBefore I post this I'd like to say everyone has their flaws, regardless of their MBTI type! And of course it isn't always down to MBTI, however there are certain patterns of recurring behaviours that I've noticed in ENFPs and I'd like to know if any of you have acted like this before or noticed this in any ENFPs irl. A lot of ENFPs I meet are great, and usually they show at least one of these traits to an extent. I can tell there will be a lot of people upset in the comments but I really don't mean any harm, this is often seen in younger ENFPs and the ENFPs that I have in mind have a lot of good qualities too. They have the potential to grow into wonderful human beings as you all do :)\n\nSorry for the long rambles or repetitions, its 4 am lol
4	I've been working in bettering myself in this aspects, but I would like to hear to how you personally deal with this traits <3
3	Hey! I'm a INFJ-A and l recently started studying MBTI and l love ENFPs i think ive only came across 1 in my life who l care alot about however l feel she does have this bad traits and l hope she works on it. It hurts me a lot but i have to distance myself from her :( the vibe is strong and its not healthy :( hopefully we can reconnect a little later in life . I am in no way a matured INFJ still young but coming across this study has really helped me with working on my shadow side of me. I really hope you ENFPs who have Identified your bad traits work on it and become better because l know you can! :)
3	You bring up some good points, but I think Im a little triggered because I sometimes get called out for trait 1. I don't want to be defensive, but also can't help think it's sometimes people are just different. For example, I personally don't mind at all if I talk about something, and someone brings up a similar story they had. I don't consider that trying to one-up me. Not saying I myself do this often, because I realize a lot of people don't like this, but I don't really mind if people do it. However, there are sometimes people who would say, "I have a similar story, but I got over it, so get over yours". That is a problem. But if I want to talk more about my thing some more, I can just talk about their story they bring up, and relate it to my thing, again. Because I think the other person has no obligation to me to talk about my stuff regardless of our friend status. I am the one who wants to talk about my bad day, so if my talking about my bad day brings up other memories for the other person, we can talk about both. But of course, sometimes you can't do that, like when someone says I have cancer.\n\nI have a lot of introverted friends, and sometimes I am really frustrated because they expect me to know what they don't say out loud, yet expect me to communicate for them in a difficult situations. For me, if I agree to see you, it's because I want to. If I listen to you, it is because I want to, not because I don't want to make you uncomfortable. If I am upset about what someone said, I either call it out, or let it slide because even if that made "me" uncomfortable, the other person has no responsibility to know unless I tell them. It seems to me some people say they agreed to do something because they did not want to make others uncomfortable, but actually they themselves didn't want to be uncomfortable. Then they think they are "self-less".\n\nYeah, it's cringey to see someone too excitable, but it's their life. I'd rather love life than be cautious all the time., looking to see if someone's upset because of what I said. Sorry for long rant, for me it brings up memories of a friend who was really nice to me, then hot and cold, and I asked him what was up and tried to mend things several times, he wouldn't tell me and completely lashed out at me publicly. Either say what is the problem, or ignore me, but don't attack me without telling me the problem. Looking back, I think he was upset about something I had said and I failed to give him the "attention", but it's really not my responsibility to know if he wouldn't tell me.\n\nAt least ENFPs express they want attention. Everyone wants attention. The thought of introverts quietly sitting there and repressing their needs and waiting for someone to notice their subtle signs, just creep me out.\n\nOf course, the other examples you bring up sound awful, I just want to offer another perspective.
3	No BS I've known I am an undeveloped ENFP for a long time and everything you just said was dead ass accurate for me. I read somewhere these were typical traits of an ENFP that hasn't matured yet. Glad to know others have seen or noticed this too. More confirmation for things I need to work on. \n\n\n\nSo... Do you want to vent to us about anyone else? I like your psychoanalysis of people hahaha 
3	The problem with all of these things is that ENFP's (including me) often don't even realize they are a problem or that anyone was hurt or annoyed. Personally I am all about openness and honesty and communication. I try to engender this in others, especially with relationships. And that is how I found out I did some of these things. I always thought they were helpful or nice. This is why I appreciate and welcome criticism. If you don't know what's wrong how can you grow?
2	I had a hard time with one enfp gal. She's in her 30s and mature in other areas of life but unhealthy as I have witnessed those traits in her. I feel like her manipulating me was more about being validated why her feelings are more important which came off as self-absorbed. Unfortunately I cut ties with her. 
2	I've been known to have moments when all of the above were true to some extent. However I kind of know where the pitfalls are and try to avoid them by filtering my actions and not giving into every urge.\nIts hard, in particular when my emotions get into that frenzy of tangled web of yearning.
2	I suspect one of my closest friends is an unhealthy ENFP. I myself am ENFP and forsure see a lot of my ‚Äòold self‚Äô in my friend. \n\nOur friendship began because she was roommates with a very good friend of mine (also ENFP, not relevant but kinda funny so many of us under one roof). One day I was hanging out with my friend and his roommate (unhealthy ENFP) comes home really upset. She is talking down on herself and isolates herself in her room. She eventually comes out and tells us she is disappointed in herself because she dropped all her college courses and feels lost. I have been in her exact position so I reach out and try to connect with her and tell her to come to dinner with us. \n\nWe eventually got closer and closer. She signed up for classes at my university and ended up picking the same major as me. I thought this was a little weird at first but not too disturbing because I was a psych major and I know psych interests many people. As our friendship grew I noticed a growing competitiveness in her. She would compare herself to me a lot and eventually started showing a lot of jealousy. I tried to ignore it but it eventually started wearing me out. We shared a lot of the same classes so the competitiveness got stronger. I‚Äôm not trying to sound like an ass but I had been in classes longer than her and was set to graduate before her and I naturally performed better than her on most assignments. I could see the jealousy and she eventually started passive aggressively vocalizing her distaste for my success. \n\nOur friendship suffered during my senior year of college (her junior year) when I was working full time, in school full time and had an internship full time. She started relying on me for everything. I had to be there for her to get studying accomplished, her homework done, she even started asking me to run little errands with her due to her anxiety. Not to mention we worked together too. There was no break. At first I was fine with this because I enjoyed our relationship but it slowly became exhausting because she only talked about herself and her passive aggressive remarks with me became more noticeable. \n\nWe got into an argument because I came to work in a bad mood because I was fighting with my bf. I didn‚Äôt tell her about it because I was used to not sharing my problems with her due to me being the one SHE came to for her problems. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable venting to her. Anyways, she was also in a bad mood and that day I wasn‚Äôt playing into her emotional manipulation and she didn‚Äôt like how distant I was being when she so obviously had a problem of her own (which she was only communicating through poor attitude and anger). She made a poor remark at how I was ‚Äúbeing a bitch‚Äù and I lost it. I told her not everything was about her and if I‚Äôm not using all my energy to make sure she‚Äôs okay every second of the day it doesn‚Äôt mean I dislike her it just means I have my own issues to worry about, not to mention how she never asks how my life is going and how our conversations are always focused on her inner turmoil. I snapped a bit. She was surprised and avoided me the rest of the day. \n\nWe eventually made up (she apologized) but our relationship will never be great. I don‚Äôt trust her or see very much depth in her. I don‚Äôt feel valued by her and feel that she uses me more than she lets me use her. We are still friends but I have since graduated and she is now doing very poorly in school. When we hangout she still only talks about herself and when I do happen to take the convo to myself for a bit she is always either on her phone or I only get part of her attention. She has redeeming qualities and I know she is a good person and means well. This is why I think she is what you are referring to as an unhealthy ENFP. Her heart is in the right place and she strives to be the potential person she can be but she lacks very much in execution and I believe therapy would help her. \n\nSorry for the rant. 
1	Just curious, what type are you? Do you have a specific enfp in mind whos bothering you as you wrote this?
8	ENFP Stack Functions as Songs	What songs do you think best relate to each of the stack functions for ENFPs? \n\nHere's my list at least: \n\n===========================\n\n\n\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><\n\nNe-HERO:\n\n \n\nBrainstorming the possibilities, curiousity about almost anything, optimistically concerned with the motivations of others, generating patterns from chaos, ever wanting to experience novelties, and optimistic toward the future, I think Walk Through Life makes sense: https://youtu.be/gAmLVdklfcA\n\n\n \n <><><><><><><><><>\n===========================\n \n\nFi-HERO: \n\n \n\nHaving strong values, sympathetic kindness, a burning desire to be authentic and unique, being passionately motivated by their feelings for others, the song fitting is Run With Us by Lisa Lougheed: https://youtu.be/usFFKNRB2z8\n\nAlso, Michelle Wilson's song "Casual Friends" here is quite relating to the ENFP Fi-Si Loop.\nhttps://youtu.be/vbzJbxLcmhs\n\n \n\n \n<><><><><><><><><>\n===========================\n \n\nTe-CHILD: \n\n \n\nWith practical solutions as the playfully optimistic function, they easily find ways to make things work and tend to appreciate well thought out presentations. In anger, they can be brutally honest for a moment, which I rename as the Te-rebuke rather than the more vulgar term used by some. They extravert creativity and intelligence and present some of the most well reasoned arguments ever, often with an emphasis on their Fi values in a manner which cogently combines emotion with reason. Finding a song really relating to this is a bit difficult, but the first stress mode for ENFPs is the Ne-Te loop which is brainstorming creative ways to make things work, and so I think Shut Up And Dance by Walk The Moon seems like it may relate a sense of ENFP Te: https://youtu.be/6JCLY0Rlx6Q\n \n\n \n\n\n<><><><><><><><><>\n===========================\n \n\nSi-ASPIRATIONAL:  \n\n\nThe source of fears being routine, duty, bad memories of the past, as well as being aspirationally like an ISTJ and duty minded in Si-grip stress, they can also go through an introverted Fi-Si loop and be stuck in focusing on their feelings regarding bad memories of the past. So, Crawling by Linkin Park makes sense: https://youtu.be/Gd9OhYroLN0\n\nOr for developed Si, "We Belong" by Pat Benatar is super Si relating and she's ENFP. https://youtu.be/qxZInIyOBXk\n\n \n \n\n<><><><><><><><><>\n===========================\n \n\nNi-NEMESIS: \n \n\nThe source of worries being the most probable bad future for themselves, not wanting to settle on one singular possibility either, they become like a future-pessimistic INFJ when stressed into their shadow functions. Ni also having to do with will, a worry is about what they want for themselves while their Ne-hero strongly focuses on the wants of others. While an Ni-hero type with Ne-nemesis worries about the motivations of others, they worry about their own motivations. It also makes them worry about commitment a bit too, though not fear it like ESFPs or ESTPs with Ni-inferior. For this I think a song conveying a worry about the future might make sense. "Heartbreaker" by Pat Benatar might make sense. https://youtu.be/mIosHNpGjTE\n \n\n \n\n\n<><><><><><><><><>\n=========================== \n \n\nFe-CRITIC: \n \n\nBeing critical of bandwagons as well as being critical of how good a friend they are  it can be a bit difficult for them. Their strong values & feelings override the Fe concerns for social harmony, which is actually good in an Isaiah 5:20 world IMO, but they still have a fair bit of empathy and it really hurts them when people abandon them. They tolerate plenty of differences, and it really stinks for them when others can't do the same. I think a favorite song of my ENFP friend makes sense here, True Believers by Bouncing Souls: https://youtu.be/QP2cOXCTroA \n\nAlso, Michelle Wilson's awesome song "Push", in which she says, "I don't know how to give you what you need. I don't know how to give you room to breathe. I want you to be happy, give you everything you need." I think this goes with Fe-critic and Fi-parent, both, but mainly Fe-critic I think. It's about telling a crush how you feel, and it not going so well, I think.  https://youtu.be/bhL3q4EfYPo\n\n \n\n\n<><><><><><><><><>\n===========================\n \nTi-PoLR \n \n\nNot having any super strong attachment to any given dogma or system of arbitrary logical consistency in general, it helps them to fit in with almost anyone and reason with others they otherwise disagree with. Kinda the opposite of people which look for any excuse to call others "heretics!", they can be friends with just about anyone because of this. I think a song conveying open-mindedness to reason or somehow being friends with anyone would make sense. Perhaps Last Of The Real Ones by Fall Out Boy could work: https://youtu.be/z9xJ3y7SM7Q\n\n\n\n \n\n<><><><><><><><><>\n===========================\n\nSe-EXTREME:\n \n\nBeing offset by brainstorming as the hero function, being present ATM is often displaced. Focus on the outside world at hand is either underdone or overdone. Normally ENFPs may be rather clumsy while focusing on the inner world of Ne possibilities, but not in Se mode per se. Exercising like crazy, comfort eating, or sensory indulgence in 8th-function grip is possibly even stronger than Se-grip for INTJs when stressed enough to be in this state of sadness. :( I hope that doesn't happen too often. It can make an ENFP sort of like an ESTP for a short while, filling the role of a doer for a time, but it is not good for ENFPs to be stuck like that. Being a creative inspirer is far less stressful for them. "Invincible" by Pat Benatar could make sense for ENFP's superego mode of quasi-ESTP. https://youtu.be/5A4xBp2rizQ\n\n=========================== \n\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><

2	Yes, amazing and accurate.
4	It's Too Excited Tuesday!	\nCAN I GET A HELL YEAH?! It's Too Excited Tuesday! Unleash the happy!\n\nWhat makes you excited? :D\n
2	I'll be going on a trip to Europe at the end of this week (as long as the revolution hasn't started yet in the US). I'm quite excited. 
1	Heck Yes! and Everything is Tuesday...[https://youtu.be/Qc7v-w7cnEU](https://youtu.be/Qc7v-w7cnEU)
1	HELL YEAHHH!!!1!!
1	I just have finalized plans for a week long hike in north sweden next summer!\n\nAnd I even have people to go with me!\n\nYAY!\n\n
1	I turned a quarter of a century yesterday.  \n  \nI say it that way instead of 25 because it's more epic
2	Overthinking	How do you guys deal with overthinking as an ENFP?
5	I embrace it. üòÖ And then invite my INFP, INTJ and INTP friends to join if they so want to indulge. 
3	depends what i'm overthinking about, it can be fun to overthink something so incredibly mundane and derive greater meanings from things that are so simple. But it can also be a trap if you are pressed for time, if you need a *real* solution, or if the overthinking is about past experiences and its causing undue mental stress or anxiety. \n\nAs for the former, I indulge in it. Its maybe the most pure form of fun to me. I talked with a friend for an hour about washing dishes, by the end of it she didn't realize how important the task is to her maturation and that she had such deep thoughts about dish washing. \n\nAs for the latter, its about recognizing when it happens earlier and earlier each time. Once you recognize that you are overthinking you can try to redirect yourself or get yourself into Te mode (more based on logic and facts than possibilities). I also will often explore my Fi and ask myself why I am overthinking something? Am I just anxious that this girl doesn't like me and that is why I'm overthinking every potentially awkward pause in our prior conversation? (for example). Do I feel inadequate and that is why I'm procrastinating on my schoolwork or job? Identify what is causing the problem, and give yourself the advice you'd give to someone else. Whether that means reassuring yourself of your accomplishments or knowledge, or reminding yourself that life is awkward or focusing on the positive interactions, or whatever. Things are rarely as bad as our Ne projects, especially when Fi is actually driving the car. 
2	I try not to think about it üòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nUmm, but actually that's my answer too. I'm usually pretty aware that I'm overthinking something and I set a time limit for my thoughts... this is especially true when I'm overthinking about a decision I have to make. 
2	Oh man, it's the one thing I hate about being an enfp bc it just drains me sometimes.\n\nOften is the same thought that runs through my head and it drives me bonkers.\n\nI usually pray about it then tell myself "No!" when it starts to happen. 
1	I have realized that anxiety and over-analyzing and worrying don't do anything. If anything they make things worse. Try to focus on solutions instead. If something is out of your control then worrying about it really does nothing.
96	ENFP and falling in love	I‚Äôm a very naturally flirty person, and I definitely like the attention. But it is a struggle for me to actually have feelings for someone - I see people as a bit of fun or solid friends. However, when I do fall for someone, I fall HARD. Almost to an obsessive extent and it fucks with my mental health quite badly (even though it rarely happens). \n\nI know when someone is very keen towards me it is a bit intense and I am a bit put off (I am very loving and affectionate but I dont want to feel like someone NEEDS me). But when I like someone I find it very hard to play it cool. Does anyone have any tips for this??? I‚Äôm really an open book and just throw myself out there, but other people often find it intense as they are much more reserved. \n\nWhat‚Äôre your guys experiences with falling in love? 
46	I‚Äôm just like this. For me, I just remind myself ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt control how you feel, but you can control your actions‚Äù so, I may be intensely into this person and I can‚Äôt control that. But I can control what I tell them and how often I text them. It‚Äôs hard. Good luck!
21	Crushes are pretty often, and they go away easily. But love is not a feeling, it's an action. Committing to someone and choosing someone each day.   \nRelationships are hard and you work on them.
14	WOW, this is me, I am glad I‚Äôm not alone. Also, it‚Äôs nearly impossible to move on. 
11	Find it just as intense...I try to *act* more reserved. Does it work?? Probably not lol
9	LPT: Learn the difference between curiosity and attraction.\n\n\nI always used to mix the two up because they go hand in hand so often. I meet people, and I get really curious. I want to get to know them; hear about their experiences; where they're going; and what they're planning, feeling, and thinking. That's curiousity.\n\n\nAttraction is curiousity with a rosy hue to it. It's hard to describe the exact difference for me, since I'm still figuring this one out, ahahaha.\n\n\nBut it can save you and the other person from unnecessary heartache. I hate accidentally leading someone on, and I hate committing to someone I was only curious about (as I realized after, I wasn't attracted). Both of those are really sour feelings, and not at all what I wanted out of my pursuit.
8	Why don't you just @ me next time ...\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\nOh wait Reddit lol\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\nWhy don't you just u/ me next time
6	I'm exactly like this! Happened quite recently, in fact. I fell for a guy who is really great, but very different in his beliefs (only dated within in his religion), so I was painfully aware of the fact that it'd never happen. The ENFP in me was overly optimistic, and still dreaming that he'd change his ways and like me despite my being from a different religion. So it sucked a lot, because I was just friends with this guy who was so frustratingly attractive to me. \nWhat helped me get over it is finding his moral flaws. We ENFPs are idealists, and the only thing that can actually turn me off about a guy is if I can convince myself he's not as "good" as I thought he was. I realized he used his faith to judge people, and was very self-righteous in a pretentious way. Now whether or not that actually is true, it's probably not. But convincing myself of this helped me get over it. I know it sounds messed up, but as long as you can genuinely believe it'll never happen, and find some sort of moral issue with the guy, you can get over it.
7	Mee. I‚Äôve been in a few relationships and never thought I‚Äôd really be in love with someone bc I just felt so so about the other person.. until I met my now boyfriend and I‚Äôm sooo in love it scares me. I feel obsessive sometimes and I hate it.. it‚Äôs occasionally hard to control my emotions for him bc I‚Äôm in so deep 
5	Being direct can be sexy too. Be honest but not irrational in your way of telling them. If you like the person, you should make sure that what you tell them you're sure you mean. You can end up accidently misleading them if it's all just infatuation. Choose your words carefully, but never be afraid of expressing what you're sure about.
4	Yeah ENFPs are very obvious when they really like someone. This intensity can freak people out though especially when it manifests in obsessive and possessive actions as well.  I would suggest reflecting on your actions and feelings alone whenever possible. And bounce off ideas to others as well to see if you are acting too intensely. ENFPs are optimists who will fall in love with their ideal of the person rather than the ACTUAL person. So facing the truth of that person will come sooner or later. And that can be crushing to the ENFP. So staying grounded as much as possible and taking things slow will help the process. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd remember, if the other person feels the same way, they will still be there even if you don't always initiate. They will also not play with your feelings. It takes two to make things work. 
5	Ooooh maaaaan am I feeling this. Especially what /u/secretlyslytherin said. I am currently completely and totally smitten with someone who is a strong atheist while I am religious. My feelings are intense to the point of driving me insane. In my life I've probably only felt this intense about 4 people including him and I'm in my late 30s. We're a decade apart in age, have very little in common, and the religion thing causes a serious divide. But we both love to be around each other and have a great connection. We haven't kissed or anything but we're very physically affectionate. Or rather, I'm physically affectionate with him and he seems to enjoy it. LOL Just hugging and cuddling. In the past year I had strong feelings for another guy, but he never let me in. He wouldn't even hug me. We were just friends. I had super strong feelings for him but I was still able to check out other guys and have the hots for them. The current guy absolutely has let me in and I feel completely comfortable being myself at all times with him. But we have almost nothing in common other than being smart, rational people who enjoy having intellectual discussions with each other. The religion thing causes a huge divide and we've discussed the possibility of dating and that is the thing that causes us to feel like we can't. But it doesn't stop my heart from feeling the way it does. The other day I saw a guy who I would normally be attracted to and I realized I had no interest in even pursuing it. That's a bad thing. That's when I realized I'm totally fucked. Because it means that my heart has given itself to this current guy. I thought I was doing so good with my self-control with the previous guy because I knew I hadn't given him my heart. Despite my intense feelings. But apparently it's just because he hadn't let me in, so I was able to keep my walls up. But with a guy who I have a real connection with and who lets me in and who makes me feel valued, I'm basically screwed. We can't be together, I can't stop my heart from feeling the way it does. The only thing I can do is suffer through watching him date other girls, or cut him out. I'm fairly close to cutting him out even though I know that will hurt. Stupid intense ENFP heart. So hard to fall, so intense when a fall happens. I've always given the advice to other people that when this happens to focus on something you enjoy doing and try to avoid initiating contact with the person you feel intensely for. I know it's hard though. Believe me I know. LOL
2	Some people can handle your intensity. But even though you are feeling it strongly, try to slow down a little in terms of actions and what you say to the person. Check in with your Fi regularly to make sure you know what you are looking for and if this is the right time/place for a significant relationship in your life, and make sure to communicate this as necessary. Can you integrate this relationship into your daily life for the long run? \n(feel free to take this with a grain of salt, this is from a slightly jaded infj. I loved my enfp's intensity and it was fantastic for a year and he seemed all committed, then he got avoidant and didn't know how to mesh our long distance relationship with the rest of his life/goals.) 
2	What helped me chill with my crushes, was to ask them questions and focus on ways to be a friend but without giving myself away too much.\nBut the fact I had them talking so much about themselves helped things chillout, I felt fulfilled from my Ne gathering information and they feel good cuz they get to talk about themselves \nThen i just hold her hand for a little bit and then chill like friends again and then by then she usually wants more, not necessarily sex but at least more affection more time with me, etc 
1	Well I‚Äôd really rather you throw yourself onto me. I‚Äôve been dating an ENFP for a while now and she just feels so distant all the time it kinda sucks. :(
1	Yup this is me exactly and I wish I had some great advice to come with but I‚Äôm just a mess üíî 
1	I can relate kind of... but the more I like someone the more shy I act around them so it probably seems confusing to them that I‚Äôm an extrovert but I act so differently with them LOL \n\nI say just be yourself, and know that it‚Äôs ok to be vulnerable and open with them but do it slowly so that there are still things for them to learn about you and vice versa. 
1	I'm an enfp and it's generally expected for tons of affection on the giving and receiving end but for me personally I struggle with accepting any form of affection. Ranging from compliments to physical touch to my s/o buying stuff for me. I just do not like it at all. I tend to come of really cold despite wanting to be affectionate, but like you when I fall, I FALL. so I try to save that affection for the right person. \n\nI've only been able to experience giving that affection to one person, but it ended badly so now I'm backed off of the idea of giving someone affection. it just isn't the same without that person so giving it to someone else feels like I am almost betraying them. \n\nI definitely love deeply when it's real. 
1	I'm like this too and I'm glad that I'm not the only one. I don't have a proven answer for you, but I do know that it's better to be with someone who knows who you are than pretending to be someone else. That being said, I try to express my feelings in my private ways by writing about it or something like that so they don't have to be the recipient of all my emotions all at once. I'll also try to occupy myself with other things that I enjoy. Still, the right person will appreciate how hard you fall for them so I don't think you should suppress those tendencies or talk yourself out of them. 
1	Not gonna lie I got really drunk the first few times I saw him. 
1	I swear to God I ghost wrote this holy shit. Everything u described is üíØ me
1	So I've done this before, too. In some cases I've realized the person is going to just always be a friend. I can relate to 3 different cases of this in the last 2 years of my life. \n\n\nMost recently, though, was with someone I've known for a while, we'll call her Jasmine, but had already written off as strictly platonic, and I'd been fine with that for five plus years. So knowing that going in to our meetup made it a lot more relaxing. I had to mentally prep myself so I wouldn't "fall" for her again. And it worked, actually. \n\nBut I got hit with something else I was not expecting. Happiness hangover. Ever heard about it? It's when depression hits after having something like a great achievement or vacation or whatever happen. I felt deflated. \n\n\nThis is what I felt the first time I had met Jasmine. This same happiness hangover hit me with someone else I thought was a love interest about 2 years ago, we'll call her Stacy. I fell hard for Stacy, too. In fact, she fell for me, but we had difficult circumstances. She fell for me when I wasn't falling for her, i fell for her when she wasn't for me, it was a mixed bag. \n\n\nSo while it's not really depression I was feeling, I was definitely feeling deflated for 1-2 days, then back to my usual self. It's because we were being emotionally available for each other. \n\n\n\nI should mention when I met up with my friend Jasmine this past fall for a day long hike, we spent all day catching up, opening up about good and bad and happy and sad and explored all of our emotions. This is someone who i've been in regular contact with for close to 20 years now. Heck, I was just now texting her, and she tells me she now has met someone who has turned her world upside down. At first I felt very happy, then a little hollow, but now I'm completely happy. I had to remind myself that the reason we've been such good friends is because that's what friends do, we're here emotionally for each other, and to not get things twisted. \n\n\nEvery time I"ve spent full days with people, be it females or males alike, I can feel happiness hangovers. I felt one after the holidays from my family. I just think that before I wasn't recognizing them, because I was associating them with the time I spent with a woman and not realizing it happens when I spend time with anyone. Being around people makes me happy. \n\n\n\nSorry if it seems like I got off on a tangent. I just wanted to point out my realization I've had over the last few years of why it felt like I was falling hard for women and only being rejected. I'm worried less now about finding the love of my life. The way I figure it, if I continue to have good friends, then the more I do hang out, the more often I am to run into maybe one of their friends that is the right person for me.
1	You also have to be careful of the person you're focusing your attention on. It's the conundrum of an ENFP.  Caring about people and relationships except when they find themselves the victims of the feels. The self absorption and all the defenses get turned on high. \n\n
4	ENTJ <> ENFP combination	\nWhat do you all think about the ENTJ and ENFP combination in friendships and relationships? The good? Blind spots? \n\nI (F ENTJ) have noticed that a lot of my friends are ENFPs and we get along great. I‚Äôve also recently started having feelings for an ENFP and the combination feels really balanced. 
4	Hmmm. In my experience it can be a little rough. I find that I usually get along so well with ENTJs and appreciate their energy, intellect and vicious wit, in many cases. But it seems it always comes to a point of contention or a very acute and specific discord. Irreconcilable differences. Too many fundamental differences, perhaps. 
4	I admire ENTJs ngl. An ENFP could help the ENTJ understand their emotions and feelings better while an ENTJ can help the ENFP to be more productive and actually finish stuff. It would be an "everyone wins" type of relationship :o\nJust be careful to not be too blunt with the respective ENFP. While ENTJs are usually called out for being mean in arguments, ENFPs can be as bad (since we also have Te that activates under stress). Slowing it down and talking things out loud will solve the problem.\nThe relationship will probably get steadier and steadier as time goes on since you'll both know eachother better and the ENFP will start developing their Te better, as well as you developing your Fi.
3	Don't like it. Te Doms can aggravate the enfp's very sensitive Fi often. As a type hypersensitive to criticism and people acting like they know them from what meets the eye , Te Doms who tend to look at the obvious and verbalize their judgments often tactlessly instead of seeking more information from the enfp first tend to cause lots of conflicts. \n\nEntj may feel the enfp is too emotional during conflicts \nEnfp may feel the Entj spouts quick judgments too often and may even look down on their Te and weak Fi\n\n\npros : they can have a good laugh together , enfp may even find the ENTJs struggle with understanding emotional people endearing. ENTJ cares a lot. 
3	Im ENFP and my husband is ENTJ. At the beginning, there were lots of challenges. He was direct and blunt and honest and I was sensitive and emotional. So we clashed. a lot. But the longer we were together and came to understand the way the other person worked, the better we gelled as a pair. Myers Briggs helped a ton, actually. Once I understood his behavior wasnt intentionally "mean", it was just who he was as a person (in the same way me being emotional wasnt something I did on purpose, it just WAS), I could see his actions in a different way. We are yin and yang and so happy together! Nine years! 
2	If you are anything like a INTJ but more Extrovert it probably would be a decent match up. I Am ENFP/INFP and my Daughter is an INFP/ENFP and we both like INTJs. I have not met a ENTJ that I am aware of, yet.
2	hmmmm I think entj could be cool if they are mentally healthy. but so far the entj I met was my ex and he was pretty abusive. however, he thinks I'm an angel to him and he just sincerely view me one of the most reliable person etc..like the feeling aren't mutual, he thinks we are very close and he couldn't even see I resent him.  
2	I am a ENFP guy with an ENTJ girlfriend so maybe I can help. If you do end up getting together I have some advice. Communicate. Tell each other what is bothering you and what you want. I know it can be difficult for ENTJ's to express their feelings sometimes or insecurities or things they are sensitive about but it is not weak. It is strength and it will strengthen the relationship. Don't put up more walls, try to open up. Also realize you two are different. You are probably someone who focuses intently on one thing while he, an ENFP, is a multi-tasker and can seem to jump from one thing to the next and sometimes from serious to goofy very suddenly. Don't let it overwhelm you and try not to let things get to you. If he offends you or upsets you it is almost certainly unintentional so tell him about it and exactly what he did and how to avoid it in future. Don't make him try to guess.
1	Really dislike the majority of them. They get more benefit from our relationship than us - to us they're often very demanding and draining and honestly just mean sometimes... Seriously. There's a reason they're known as a default bitch-mode type. 
1	Thinker versus Feeler. One will want to talk theory, ideas and philosophy. One will want to talk about Feelings.\n\nJudger versus Perceiver. One needs plans and closure. One is flexible and spontaneous.\n\nThey can learn from each other.\n\nGood Luck, that's quite the ride. Not quite as bumpy as an Intuitive versus a Sensor.
10	I hate my 9-5	Wow I‚Äôm an ENFP & I‚Äôm miserable at my job. I don‚Äôt want to seem ungrateful because I know there are others that don‚Äôt have a job. But I seriously hate mine. But yet I have been compulsive with my money before and now i have debt that needs to be paid. And I have a decent paying job. \n\nI quit my job 1 year ago after reading ‚ÄúRich dad Poor dad‚Äù and decided to start an Amazon business to pursue my dreams. But that went south and I lost my investment then had to come back to the job I hate in order to pay bills. \n\nLol there‚Äôs no creativity here. \n\nI just want to have my own online business where I can be location independent. üò™ \n\n\nI‚Äôm just ranting.. and I probably sound unhealthy asf. 
9	Hey, I just want to let you know that I‚Äôm right there with you. Recently someone gave me some very good advice though, and here it is. Think of your job as just a way to pay the bills, and that‚Äôs it. Appreciate the friends you make there, and find a solid group, because that‚Äôs what makes the office life tolerable. It‚Äôs just temporary.\nYou have a lot of time outside of this 9-5 time frame. What you do with that time is what really matters. You need to put in the work and grind on the weekends and after work. You want to be an artist, writer, DJ...etc? You practice your passion then. You want a masters degree? You get it online and do the assignments after work. The work you‚Äôre doing now... it‚Äôs just work. Don‚Äôt place so much emphasis on it. The true, honest life you‚Äôre living are all those hours after work.
3	Wow I‚Äôm literally right there with you, didn‚Äôt go into work today because I‚Äôve been feeling the same way 
2	I think you probably need to leverage your fledgling online business with a "real job" for the time being, so doing both?  It means working a lot, but the upside would be that you might start up a capital fund for yourself for when you eventually do go independent.  \n\nI've been a freelancer for two separate industries for the past 5 years and I've found that's worked for me.  I work in construction, so the money is a little bit better paid than most unskilled jobs but not enough for how dirty, laborious and bullshit it is.  Nonetheless, it has been a place where i've honed new skills despite its negative caveats.  My other work is an audiobook producer.  For the first couple years, I was doing projects that weren't delivering very well before I found my niche.  Then I realized that quality is super-duper important, especially because you are competing against the entire other marketplace.  You have to stand out.  And I do this by having a degree of perfection(clever editing, dynamic voices, SFX, crystal clear quality) that is ridiculous, at least when told to others.  The last project I did took 7x longer than it was estimated because all of the nitpicking I did with details, but because I am paid royalties and get exposure; the results really stand out because I make my time back with money and I am getting more and more followers.  \n\nIf you're going to be a business owner, I believe that quality is the subtle snowball that elicits continued clients and beckons new people to you by word-of-mouth.  It requires a lot of sacrifice because you have to be doing things differently, and better (and probably a lot more time-consuming) than your peers.  This is what I've learned.  I hope it helps you.
2	Same here. Im in a similar situation. We just have to power through this. It‚Äôs not forever
2	/r/financialindependence  \n  \nThis should be mandatory ENFP consideration
1	I feel you. I just got fired from my job lol and couldn't be more hopeful. Good luck 
14	Your opinions of INTJs	Hi, I am an INTJ female. When on the INTJ subreddit this personality type comes up quite a lot as apparently we are quite compatible.\n\nIf you have ever met an INTJ, what did you think of their overall personality? 
14	My boyfriend is an INTJ and we hit it off since we first met. I also hit it off with other INTJs just because we have such different perspectives and discuss every topic possible. They‚Äôre always very intelligent and I am pretty knowledgeable myself so it‚Äôs fun to me to have conversations where I learn things and can share things that I know. I feel slightly intimidated and I love it bc it gives me a challenge. The only part ENFPs and INTJs clash about is expressing feelings bc he keeps a lot of his emotions and feelings to himself and I‚Äôm always showering him with love. 
10	In relation to myself, they're very balancing, interesting, serious in a cute way? endless ideas and topics to debate and get into with them, they seem a little sneaky before talking to them the way they stay together in their thoughts. Those are just some first impressions, to me their values and character will play a larger role. And that's with anyone's personality.
7	Are you peeking behind our ENFP's friends curtains? I hang out here also.\n\nI really like these nice people. My best friend online is an ENFP. She is adorable, and smart.
5	Wow! I just can‚Äôt believe how many positive comments there are about INTJs! I wish more INTJs could see this to know how much they are loved! (We love you guys too!‚ò∫Ô∏è)
3	***We INTJs are literally the worse***, but we can have the good side of us brought out from time to time and in the right environment üòú
5	I have an awesome INTJ friend that I click really well with. Here's some things I like about my friend:\n- doesn't discount my intelligence because of the manic pixie stuff\n- I enjoy the very logical approach to showing affection. It's also so cute! \n- is an absolute goofball and full of witty jokes when in a comfortable social setting\n- super intelligent = awesome conversations\n- grounds me when I get a little too carried away with my ideas. Great to brainstorm with! \n- we have almost identical sense of humor \n\nYou guys rock! <3
5	Not generally a fan of high Te users. Less annoying than ENTJs but still aggravating often.\n\nenfps tend to joke around a lot and even misrepresent themselves because of their active Ne Fi. They can passionately express something this morning and by tomorrow morning as something completely differently just as passionately. Today they can want to be a counselor and feel so inspired  tomorrow they could write you an essay on why it's not for them. \n\nINTJs are very serious and pay attention to everything you say as if they are studying you. They may get frustrated with the enfp seeking fickless and my form judgments about them and verbalize those judgments harshly which in turn greatly offends the enfp if such judgments attack their strong sense of self and what they deeply value. \nEnfps with especially sensitive Fi tend to struggle with criticism from high Te users even more than they would from Ti 
3	I'm an INTJ. I met an ENFP once at a party. We had a lot of fun for the little while we were messing around. Very quirky personality, very individual. Did not last long though, I'm a very intense person and our personality styles ended up not working out. ie: they were really into arts, and I am basically a computer nerd who programs in their spare time.
3	I rarely meet INTJs but the few that I do meet are very intelligent. I enjoy conversing with them about topics that require me to think. The experience to expand what you know into new territory is very rewarding and sharing that with an INTJ makes the connection extra special to me
3	My fianc√© is an INTJ. It‚Äôs so weird how different we are but we fit together so well. \nSo I love them. üòÇ \nBut they are some of the most intelligent and surprising (in a good way) people I know \n(Our couple friends he is ENFP and she is INTJ so we all get along perfectly) 
3	My cousin is an INTJ and it's great, we're very close. We grew up together and used to have a lot of arguments when we were younger but now we spend so much time together without much hassle at all. We both have a very strange sense of humour and way of communicating that we've built up for a long time and it's one of the best things in my life. He is very private and complicated, it's very interesting to have a peek into how his mind works whenever he lets me (and he hardly lets anyone). I find it difficult to make decisions but he has a very rational mind and helps me come up with logical conclusions. He's super intelligent, we spend a lot of time discussing abstract situations and possibilities and theories within our world and our favourite films and books. He can seem very serious to others and when we're together I can help bring him out of his shell and show people a glimpse of his goofy side. He is honestly such a treasure and I'm so lucky to have an INTJ in my life!! It takes a lot of work to get to know them but since I'm pretty patient and curious its no problem to me :))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI love you INTJs!!!
2	I dated an INTJ (I think, she never took the test) and it was a great relationship... until (well see post history, not INTJ-related). \n\nMy best friend is an INTJ though and he's amazing! We always have such awesome conversations and a ton of fun. He might actually be an INTP though, can't remember. No, fairly certain an INTJ.\n\nwell yeah he's my best friend soo :D
2	They can be fun to talk to and discuss ideas and hypotheticals, but the relentless nitpicky pedantic nature and unwillingness to play along with jokes just kind of frustrate me. 1 on 1 it can get a little boring, no offenseüòò
2	I am almost 40 and my three best friends are INTJs. So is my wife. There is a comfortableness in our differences that we all enjoy. I have been with all of them for over 20 years. And yet, I know that when I see them next, when we're just sitting around and talking, one of them, each of them, will say something that will make me laugh so hard my stomach hurts. And I know that I'll do the same for them.
2	I had a huge crush on an INTJ. I didn‚Äôt know he was INTJ until later on in our friendship. I found him mysterious and I wanted to get to know him better. I wanted him to open up to me and I wanted him to share his interests with me. We met through school in a lab and he talked a lot but never more than he was prompted to and that‚Äôs what interested me. He didn‚Äôt have a problem letting people know his opinions but I wanted him to talk to me without bounds if that makes sense. \n\nStill have a huge crush on him but the timing isn‚Äôt right for either of us. \n\nAlso can‚Äôt tell if he had/has a crush on me too and that ‚Äúchase‚Äù makes me weak and wanting more. 
117	Totally ENFP!	
13	Honestly though, do people actually dream of their fantasies and stuff? It‚Äôs always been just weird/surreal or mundane. I‚Äôve had only a handful of dreams that were actually about love or anything
8	And INTJ. wink\n\nNow I need a smoke. sigh
4	woah i‚Äôve never heard a correlation between ENFP‚Äôs and our crazy dreams! i dream every night and remember them 99% of the time! they‚Äôre always extremely detailed and almost always feel like very long stories. (i know they aren‚Äôt but that‚Äôs how my brain recalls them...) anyways, this is fascinating.
2	I fucking love this
2	I had a dream where I took my head off and kicked it all the way into the moon. There were also pink butterflies singing at the back.\n\nI don't know anymore.
2	My ENFP has the weirdest dreams.
1	my dreams are almost all nightmares, and even the ones that arent have bad endings. Theyre also psychotically weird expansive worlds with long stories
1	Around spring last year, I remember having a dream about the zombie apocalypse and me leading an army of survivors against them when all of a sudden,  a good friend of mine popped up beside me, demanding that I go on a date with him, and that all these fighting zombies nonsense was getting in the way of our relationship (we were /not/ in a relationship).\n\nLong story short, this dream is how I discovered I was harboring secret feelings for my ESTJ best friend.  Liking him has been a pain in the ass. Still trying to get over him tbh. 
1	Dead. Hahahahahaha. 
0	I only dream about my exes, never my current. Lol. 
2	I feel so left out in my family	Hi all,\n\n My brother is an ISFP, my other brother is an ESTJ, and my mom is an ISFP. My dad is an ENTJ. I am an ENFP. I've always not gotten along very well with my family and I often feel like I'm on the outside, looking in. My two brothers are very close and my mom gets along with them. My dad loves to lecture me and others and I hate that. I live farther away than the rest of my family does. I hate getting into fights with my brothers and that often means I can't say what I want to say because I'm terrified of losing them, but that's made me really depressed in the past because I've tried to change myself so that they will like me better and it just makes me feel worse. We just don't see eye to eye sometimes and the things they say hurt me a lot and I get angry, but my two brothers almost never fight. What should I do? 
1	Should u even be doing anything? Lol
5	How do you know when your in love?	What are usually the signs for you that your in love?
6	For me it feels just like any other addiction I‚Äôve dealt with in the past; it‚Äôs the first thing you think of when you wake up and you can feel your body craving for love from that person throughout the day. Good thing about it is that it‚Äôs not harmful for your body, bad thing is you can never fill the craving yourself.
1	When you are listening to Adele and crying your eyes out bc you realize you love him. \n\nWhen you are just sitting next to them, holding their hands, not talking, just looking at each other for hours. \n\nWhen his hugs feel like home. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nWhen you are dreaming about losing someone you love and you wake up crying realizing it was him that you don't want to lose.\n\nWhen it finally ends and you don't feel any negative emotions, just love for him. \n\nWhen you want him to find happiness even if it isn't with you.\n\nWhen you accept that you will always love him even if it is from a far and you guys don't talk anymore.\n\nThat's how I know I am in love. It's only happened once with my recent ex. I wasn't even able to tell him before we broke up. üò¢
1	For me I sometimes fight it. I tell myself, no that can't be, it is too soon, etc.. But finally when I can barely open my mouth because "I love you" will explode out I think I know. :)
2	ENFPs, what are you guys like in the dating game?	I‚Äôve been seeing an ENFP recently and all I can say is that I feel quite disheartened.\n\nNow, I understand that I am an INFP and it is partially due to my insecurity and my overly ambitious nature. However I have been plagued with a lot of doubt lately with the way things have been going.\n\nIf you were dating someone, would you reach out and want to go out with them? Everything feels so distant where I‚Äôm at. She always seems so busy all the time and I always feel like I‚Äôm unimportant to her. I understand that things can come up in life like family friends or how you guys need a lot of time to recharge due to your inferior Si. But at what point is it that I draw the line between disinterest and just taking it as she‚Äôs just an ENFP so that‚Äôs how she functions? \n\nAs a follow up on our last date, I asked her if she‚Äôd be free again this week. To my dismay, she said she‚Äôd be going overseas and I just took it and waited for her to just update me maybe on her trip or something. After 3 days of silence, I decided to text her and ask how the trip was and she said that she forgot to tell me the trip was on friday and she‚Äôs not there yet. I‚Äôve been wanting to see her since our last date yet she just doesn‚Äôt seem to be the same way. \n\nAm I being too sensitive to say that I feel slightly insulted by that? Am I really that irrelevant to her? I just feel that I‚Äôm not important to her, and if I never reached out in the first place then I‚Äôd probably be ghosted and never see her again. \n\nAm I caring too much? Am I expecting too much? \n\nPlease help me out. I have just been so troubled these past few days. 
10	Be direct. Tell her you like her and would love to spend more time together. Don‚Äôt prioritize her if she won‚Äôt do the same for you. 
7	I can't speak for her, but we ENFPs tend to be more on the "if there's a will there's a way" type. So if she didn't propose a possible future meetup or isn't talking to you much, she either has too many things going on with her life or it might be a warning bell that she isn't interested...
3	I‚Äôm really good at dating but it backfires. I think men are really put off by the fact that you‚Äôre not always going to actually be in love with them even if you treat them well and are ‚Äúhaving fun‚Äù with them.
3	It doesn‚Äôt sound like you are caring too much or expecting too much, in my opinion. Maybe that‚Äôs just me, but I would never act like she is acting if I was really into someone. 
3	hmmm I think she isn't not interested to u :( sorry buddy, otherwise you have to be very very patient. good luck 
1	Tell her all of this. Tell her how you feel and what you want and ask how he feels and what she wants. Honestly from this I would say she is not that interested but I could be wrong. Only she could tell you.
28	Who can relate? Where are you in your journey?	I am super curious how much this relates with other ENFP so I figured I would post this here too!\n\nIn the last 2 years I have doubled down on devoting my time to exploring who the fuck I am. Almost 5 years ago(ironically) Mathew McConaughey had a speech going into detail about how the person he chases or his hero is him in 5 years. I think I've reached the point where 5 years ago at 19, me now would be one of my heroes and that EXCITES me! Because I can only imagine how I am going to see myself in another 5 years. I am at a point in my life where I love who I am, I love who I am as a son, I love who I am as a boyfriend, I love who I am as a friend to others. I still have plenty to work on but rather than seeing it as a daunting.. I am EXCITED to overcome it. Because if I CAN be better, shouldn't I OUGHT to? For those in my circle that I care about, and for those outside of my circle that I have yet to meet. I owe it to everyone that has helped me and to everyone who will help me on my journey to be the best person I can be.\n‚Ä¢\nIn the words of Aristotle "Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom".\n‚Ä¢\nAnd the world will be better for this..\n\nThis was from an instagram post \n‚¨áÔ∏è\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Bs3oCErBY18/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1sbhtdzh6rq83
5	I like the idea of having future me as my hero, happy you‚Äôre evolving into your own successfully as well :)
2	Yes! I'm the same age as you, and especially this year, I've begun devoting a lot of my effort to working on myself and becoming a better person. I don't think it's a process that ever ends, but I'm excited to see where my journey takes me. Even looking back at myself this time last year, I'm completely different, and I feel really proud of that (:
11	I have created another subreddit for ENFPmusic since r/ENFPmusic is now inactive.	Feel free to check it out /r/ExNFPmusic\n\nI will be updating it more often if anyone plans to use it.Also if you are interested in being a mod you can DM me.Let me know your thoughts :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: will post music daily to keep the place active
3	That's wonderful. I'll check it out.\n\n There is also a subreddit called MBTI Radio Station. \n\nHave you listened to that?
2	What a cool idea! I'll go check it out haha
2	Confused why my ENFP friend would do this?	i may just be overthinking things, but i told my enfp friend that this one girl and i are good friends. the next day she tells me that he slid into her dms. i mean i‚Äôm not concerned over that but it‚Äôs just the fact that he decided to slide the day after i told him. and this guy may or may not be flirting with me i can‚Äôt tell. 
4	thats very weird, but as an ENFP I try to keep my intentions from ever being bad, I try to never do something with the intention to hurt or cause drama or trouble, its against my values which I value a lot\n\n&#x200B;
1	I'm old and don't know what dms means.
9	He didn't like my cute onesie footie pajamas. Dealbreaker or no?	Took my new guy to a romantic cabin getaway weekend. (new as in we met 3 months ago). I came downstairs in onesie footie pajamas and he kinda mildly scoffed and asked me how old I was. 29 technically.\n\nI think they are cute-- and ideally I would want my potential life partner to think my onesie is endearing. :/\n\nDealbreaker or do I just accept the fact that he scoffed at my ENFPness?\n\nHALP\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS I was envisioning him being enamored by my cuteness and unzipping it slowly-- leading to hot sex on the couch. But that clearly didn't happen.
13	Naw...some men just don't appreciate, Cute.\n\nMy husband would have had the same reaction. \n\n38 years later, he doesn't scoff at anything I show up in. He learned why.
6	A Onesie! Haha I hope my Future Wife wears a Onesie randomly üòÇ we could match to compliment each other! Then get hot chocolate and watch a movie, talk,  play a board game pretty much anything haha after lovemaking ;) but he should appreciate your inner child :) sorry you didn't get that response 
9	what else do you like/not like about him?  i‚Äôd say if this is a pattern (scoffing at stuff you like) - you may want to discuss it with him and evaluate the relationship based on his reaction and the outcome of the conversation. 
4	I had a partner who hated it when I wore rompers. I freaking love rompers. I don't date him anymore, not because of the rompers, but because I learned I valued being able to do what I wanted without someone jumping on my enjoyment. The pattern appeared in enough ways elsewhere I was over it
2	it's enough that you enjoy it
2	seems like a pretty fickle straw with which to break the camel's back.  If this is reason enough to be a dealbreaker, it sounds pretty toxic.  Next question is: is it you, him, or ya'll?
2	Yeah, what type is he? I would have had the type of reaction you wanted, not to be weirdüòÑ\n\nEdit: I would say this is leaning more on the deal breaker side.
1	What type is he?  I‚Äôm not surprised a guy was not glued into your enfp awesomeness. Enfps often go for sticks in the mud (I‚Äôm with an infj and yes he is!) \n\nEdit: infj became infinite on autocorrect ha 
1	35 here.\n\nI just hopped on for some time wasting after a dude left my house.\n\nI'm wearing a fuzzy Harry Potter onesie and the dudes thought it was the best.\n\nWait for the dude that loves you AND your onesie!
1	.......I love enfps lol 
1	Are you really that insecure that something having to do with a onesie is a dealbreaker?\n\nHow much so you love somebody you would break up with over a onesie? \n\nExcuse me in the case you were joking, but I generally expect people not to.
1	To be fair, if I was with a girl who wore a cute onesie and didn't like it when I unzipped it slowly, I'd be a little upset. Maybe he was just bracing himself for a possible disappointment?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNah. The potential reward far outweighs the potential disappointment. Boy shoulda smiled, kissed, and unzipped.
1	I'm going to be very direct and say that you sound pretty immature/childish if you cling so strongly to this idea of being cute and endearing that an opinion on pajamas would be a dealbreaker. 
1	Boo that guy.
97	Having that image of your perfect self.	Does anyone else constantly strive towards an image of yourself in your head? This perfect version of yourself that seems almost unattainable. It‚Äôs what keeps me improving myself, I know deep down that I can truly be an amazing person, I view myself as incomplete, but this is fine, at least I have something to work towards. 
34	I call him the √úberBensch (my name is Ben) and he represents and exemplifies all of the character traits and qualities I want to have in my life. Sometimes he's motivating and I'm excited about becoming more like him. Sometimes he feels so far away and I feel like hot garbage. Sometimes he pisses me off. Haha. 
18	Yes I do! I tend to idealize a lot of things. I have an idealized fantasy about the perfect romantic partner, for example. 
5	Yup . That's so meee! That's what keeps me going cz deep down  I know I'm worthy of my dreams.  ‚ù§
3	Yup! I've been weight training for years on and off and have not achieved my 'ideal image' yet because I've been inconsistent throughout the years. Making a big effort to get there this year! And you're absolutely right, even though I haven't gotten there yet, it gives me something to work towards and so I don't see it as a 'personal failure' just a personal goal.
3	Yes, but I would also like to point out that if anyone IMPoSES this on me, I get instantly pissed. Only I‚Äôm allowed to think I‚Äôm not good enough!! LOL
3	Yes indeed. Let that give you focus - but don‚Äôt let the search for excellence overwhelm you either. Find the balance. 
3	So I‚Äôve been struggling with this one lately. It is a part of our personality, but does anyone find it realistic? Has anyone achieved that ideal version of themselves in their head? If so, were you happy, or did your ideal version just progress to something new? \n\nFor me it‚Äôs to the point where I almost don‚Äôt recognize the person I see in the mirror. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not me‚Äù is what I frequently feel when doing so. I‚Äôve worked tirelessly to learn to accept myself just the way I am. I‚Äôm curious as to how others view and deal with this.
3	Are you sure everyone doesn‚Äôt do this?  Enfp here and I definitely do though.  Even when I was a kid I would make lists and try to be perfect and always seem to be falling short.
3	I‚Äôve always believed that the idea of ‚Äúfeeing unfinished‚Äù or ‚Äúnot being my perfect self‚Äù was always a backwards way of looking at things. You are perfect already. What you strive for is to enhance and amplify your inner self throughout life.\n\nWhat we really want is self actualization, where we are in the perfect element for us, with the skills we‚Äôve developed to be 100% us.
2	so me!! i think it‚Äôs because of Ne, that makes us visualise all the possible scenarios. we project our ideals of ourselves to the future so lots of romanticisation and idealisation. not always for the better though. i‚Äôve learnt to be careful with my thoughts the hard way. 
2	I can‚Äôt remember the philosopher at the moment, but someone once said we all feel the person we could be beating softly somewhere below the person we are now.
1	Yeuuuppp.
1	Absolutely, and one of the biggest parts for me is I want to eventually become the perfect father and the perfect husband, and Im only 21, and have never had a long relationship
1	This omg yes this. Tbh i really didn‚Äôt become self aware until I discovered that I‚Äôm an ENFP and through that understanding I have become more self aware and on top of that I have been able to better understand my self and my feelings. Through all of that it makes it easier to strive to be my perfect and even though it‚Äôs highly unlikely to achieve my perfect self the steps I am taking to get there is bettering myself in more ways than I could have imagined* 
1	Absolutely, but I also tell myself to love me at every step of my journey because I'm the same "me" no matter how much I weigh or what I go through (: I consistently strive to be better but still appreciate where I'm at and how far I've come. 
1	Yes I'm already improving!
1	I'm in hospital at the moment from punching a wall because of this. I'm way too pressured right now to be better, it's like I'm at the bottom of a well right now, surrounded by everything that's going wrong in my life; surrounded by everything that I'm not.\n\nIt's a phase and it will pass, but it will come back. It's a pretty red flag in my life, though. I'm always a calm and composed person but I'm highly considering therapy at the moment.\n\nJust waiting for my x-ray results üëå
1	Unrelated but related, I was obsessed with Chris Watts family murders saga and at the end i concluded that the only way the detectives got him to reveal gradually everything was because Chris had an idea of his ideal self and stuck to it so much that he believed in it more than the situation at hand. You could see him showing this ideal confident good-guy front, and wasn‚Äôt even acting while at it. The detectives could have played bad cop and force him to talk but they played to that front ideal self he was putting up. Moral of the story is that ideal self,  while it‚Äôs a noble version of self to pursue and even build on, Don‚Äôt hold on to it so strongly that you fuck up your reality. I guess
1	Yes but sadly this perfect image I have for myself is what can sometimes cause my anxiety. I can really go down on myself if I didn't achieve my own expectations and can put way too much pressure on myself to "improve". It's good to improve, but I think I have issues with expecting too much from myself. 
1	I do. I came across a video by Dave Powers about ENFPs and following through. He said that in order to use our Si, we have to understand that everyone "pays their dues" to be better. whether it be running/walking every day, getting enough sleep, cleaning up our room, etc. Things that I hate and suck at. But I know that "paying my dues" helps me cope with doing tasks that I loathe. 
1	Mainly woman that agree? I don't do this. I do think of things I want to do and for which I have to improve myself.  But do not keep an image of the ideal me. Why would I do or need that? Smells a lot like a big ego thing.
0	Nothing and no one is perfect; don‚Äôt put that kind of pressure on yourself! üò≠ though there is nothing wrong with working and improving parts of yourself tho lol don‚Äôt mean to get that confused. 
2	Motivational Monday!	\nToday is a new day! A fresh week! An opportunity start something new and get back into life. \n\nWhat inspires you, /r/ENFP?\n\nPost stories, quotes, and images that give you life. Need a little rally? Don't be shy posting your goals; let /r/ENFP give you a pep talk!\n
1	I just found this sub as well as my type not too long ago and I'm excited to check this community out!\n\nAnyone wanna talk about grad school? I have a BS in Biology and I want to go back for a Master's in either Environmental Science, Entomology, or some kind of professional/technical writing. Only I have no idea how to narrow down the search process and what to even expect. Hell for all I know this could be a total pipe dream. 
1	ENFP and flirting	i have an ENFP friend and he sometimes calls me cute? i‚Äôve read that ENFP‚Äôs are naturally flirtatious so i can‚Äôt tell when he‚Äôs actually flirting or not? i don‚Äôt even know if he likes me. he would always stay up to talk to me and fall asleep while we‚Äôre talking. he‚Äôd say he‚Äôs not tired and he likes talking to me so he stays up but ends up passing out 2 minutes later lol. he also teases me a lot. he says he‚Äôs going to leave and hang up but he doesn‚Äôt. one time he did and then called back saying ‚Äúreally nothing?‚Äù as if he expected me to call him back. (i didn‚Äôt know if he was joking or not) i can‚Äôt really tell. i‚Äôm not sure what to make if this situation and if he‚Äôs actually flirting with me or not??  
3	We're like golden retriever puppies sometimes so it's kinda hard to tell his intentions just from a post. It sounds like you dig him though right? You're gonna have to either talk to him about it or make a move, whichever sounds less pants-wettingly terrifying. 
1	Would you like him to flirt with you?
1	I always wants  to chat with someone I like, and stay up in the night, but I also fall asleep easly. We as ENFP love ppl. And we need attention and acceptation. That's why he wanted you to call back, he wanted you to show him your affection.\nSorry for bad english
1	Sounds like he likes you to me. But the only way to find out is to ask him yourself.
9	Flirting 101 as an ENFP	So, I am a currently 20 y/o male. I didn't make this post because I have a horrible dating life (might still be a little scared of sex, but I don't worry too much about that), but instead because it feels like I have no control over with whom i end up. It always just kind of happens. I'm guessing because it falls in line with the whole follow-your-heart-thing. But for some reason when I see a pretty girl I can't plan and make a move, only when it just "happens". I was wondering whether someone had similar experiences and or advice?
6	I also have this problem were I wonder off and bump into ‚Äúthe most amazing and perfect human‚Äù and I get myself into more serious things than other people would, simply because i follow what I‚Äôm feeling in the moment. My advice is, try to slow things down. If it‚Äôs the right person it won‚Äôt matter. They‚Äôll stay interested, you‚Äôll stay interested and in the end you‚Äôll have a lifetime together. If it was meant to be a disappointment you‚Äôll probably won‚Äôt be fascinated by them after a few days/weeks and you‚Äôll be able to see the relationship for what it is. It sounds a lot easier than it is in practice tho. 
3	Just gotta go for it sometimes if you feel a pull/ spark. If not, don‚Äôt sweat it- more will come!
2	So just to clarify, you wish you could plan to make a move? Is there a reason? Just trying to understand better before trying to give you an answer. 
4	Okay. \n\nHave you ever had a Cafe Latte with Vanilla?\n\nSo Milenco, you're twenty? What movie is your newest favorite movie? Do you like the Marvels?\n\nAnd while we're talking, I just flirted with you.\n\nNow before you shudder when you find out that I'm 60, this was practice.\n\n"Tell her you like her Shoes". Works everytime and the smart girls know why you said this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;

4	Favorite marijuana strain	I've been looking for a strain that might help bring out my personality a little more. I feel like the strains I've tried either mellow me out too much or cause me dumb out for a sec (which can be quite annoying since I smoke both day and night). Any suggestions?
6	Green Crack. All the way. Helps with creativity. Makes you feel good. Not a sluggish sort of strain. 
4	Excellent question I am following
3	My fav is called Chemdawg... it's very relaxing but with very little brain fog and it's awesome for gaming or listening to music. Sour diesel is awesome as an upper and if you can find green crack buy it! Green crack makes me talk and talk and talk. Just to clarify Green Crack is a strain of cannabis not actual crack. Girl scout cookies is great too for activities like skiing. In general though weed makes me anxious around new people. Alcohol is the way to go for me in very social settings.
3	I had one recently that I'd never heard of before called "Forbidden Fruit". Had a really unusual (but pleasant!) fruity smell, and it didn't feel like it slowed me down. Helped a lot with my general aches and pains.
2	Casey Jones and gorilla glue are my favorites!
2	Sour Diesel all the way. Allen Wrench is my favorite but I never find it anywhere anymore. 
1	I love Chocolate Fondue! My fellow ENFP pal and I smoked it for the first time together and had alllll of the laughs and creative motivation. I highly recommend it! 
36	My pet name for my bf is Monkey. I just opened our text convo and sent him this at nearly 2 in the morning. Anyone find this relatable? (He's an INTJ, for anyone who's wondering)	
7	Whaaat\n\nThis is the nickname my ENFP boyfriend gave me after about a week of knowing each other. He has me listed as Lil Monkey on his contact list.
5	Yes!!!! All of this!!!! I have to share this with my husband (an INTJ) because he'll appreciate this!
2	üòÇ i relate because i find myself coming up with these analogies 
2	Yes! and is this your boyfriend? I know him well, lol\n\n[https://youtu.be/b6vEsCJgO9o](https://youtu.be/b6vEsCJgO9o)\n\n&#x200B;
2	DAY MAN woahhhh fighter of the night monkey woahh champion of the sun
2	Yess I constantly have thoughts and they just go from one thing to another to another until I‚Äôm at the most random weird thought and then I share that with my boyfriend (also INTJ) and he‚Äôs always like wtf what made you think that.. and I can never explain how my thoughts brought me there 
1	Yeah, Yeah .... totally .... I made a Mr Bugsby and Ms Weasby with my gal at about 2 in the night too. They were cool guys to hang out with during the wee hours.

3	ENFP - ENFP Relationships	Hey fellow ENFPs! 17 F here. So recently I met this guy (by recently I mean 4 months ago) he's also an ENFP and he's a year younger than me. We started out as friends but we got along incredibly well and now we are at a little more. We both feel like everything is moving a little too fast but neither of us can seem to stop. We just get each other so well. I know that we are young and everything so I wanted you're guys' opinion on ENFP - ENFP relationships. I hope you have a wonderful day everybody!
3	I don‚Äôt know,  but I want someone who compliments me by being stronger where I am weaker. Someone who can hold my kite strings while I fly, but keep me grounded. Someone who doesn‚Äôt agree with ALL my ideas. \nI‚Äôve been married to someone like that for 37 years and knew her since I was 15\nBut that doesn‚Äôt make me an expert, so . . . \nI would say; see what happens, but do not shut off that part of your mind that knows better IF it starts objecting. You know that stupid, annoying part that tries to stop us from making bad decisions while we try to ignore it. 
3	In my (22F) experience I think an ENFP-ENFP is one of the best matches. I‚Äôm really intense when I like someone and I need someone who‚Äôs on the same level as me when it comes to that. I‚Äôve tried meet people who‚Äôs very calm and slow with their feelings but it just doesn‚Äôt work for me. I recently dated an intense ENTP-guy and it was perfect for me, so I say go for it. But if you start to feel that maybe it‚Äôs going too fast after all, talk with him and I‚Äôm sure you get your way around it. Good luck! 
2	What‚Äôs it like dating the same type as you!! 
2	Do it!  I had the absolute most beautiful life-changing relationship with another enfp at 17.  At that age, especially, girls need someone kind, introspective and validating.
2	It can be a beautiful relationship. The ENFP I know was so romantic and liked taking care of me. It was like we had the same ideas of romance and same expectations out of a relationship. Sometimes it can get boring though because we think so similarly. It's not like the banter you get out of another type where they are endlessly amusing and entertaining because they're so different from you. Good luck!
1	Yep, maybe half are still together of the people I knew. I think that might be a little higher than average 
41	Small talk erodes my soul	I know that people say that no one likes small talk. But I started an office job about 6 months ago and I can barely take another empty ‚ÄúHow are you‚Äù ‚ÄúGood, how are you?‚Äù ‚ÄúGood‚Äù and it seems that for some of my coworkers, never going beyond that level of conversation is fine. Everyone seems so goddamn happy to wade these shallow conversation waters.\n\nAnd it extends to my house. My roommate only wants to talk about the weather, or complain about her coworkers. I try to talk about how I‚Äôm feeling and she immediately ditches. \n\nWhy does no one want to talk about feelings, or meaningful concepts, or philosophy, or anything along those lines? I don‚Äôt mean rhetorically, I want to know genuinely what y‚Äôall think. Am I just surrounded by Sensors? Thoughts.
14	small talk can be fine. It's a way to generate positive feeling. Consider it like a knock knock joke. The intro is lame, but we're waiting for a punchline to have a smile at.\n\nsmall talk is really Fe though, so it feels a bit unnatural at first. I use the redundancy to find something humorous in the routine, so i let NeFi have a bit of fun.
7	Most people, especially in jobs, etc. don't want to really get close or form a relationship with everyone, or even many people at all.\n\nBut I don't think it is a Sensor thing. Personally I hate small talk. But I also don't necessarily want to talk about feelings or meaningful concepts and especially not philosophy which I consider mental masturbation in a way. Questions with no answers. Just arguments. I would rather just joke around and be silly and do bits.
3	I feel the same way. I hate when people say "how are you" without meaning it. That being said, that particularly thing could be part cultural as well. I'm American but spent the last 1.5 years abroad, mainly in cultures where you don't dare say "how are you" unless you want a real answer (it would be disrespectful to say how are you as a greeting). \n\nI also don't think it's necessarily a sensor thing. I'm with a sensor roommate right now and he'll occasionally have the deep conversation. But I don't share those deep feelings that I do with other intuitives. \n\n Try use the small talk to get into jokes or deeper conversations maybe? You kinda gotta play the social game sometimes i guess
2	Umm...While it is incorrect to 'judge' someone's type, my guess is that you may be an INTP or even INTJ, like myself. Not likely, an INFJ but maybe even ISTJ. More likely, INTJ is my guess.\n\nYou very and most likely will be correct in identifying as an Intuitive. That is obvious from your (and mine) dislike of small talk. We also write very similarly.\n\nThe Feelings function would identify you as someone who enjoys and leads with their feelings.\n\n Thinkers prefer to talk about ideas, philosophy, and theory. We are constant learners.\n\nAs for the P or the J. That is your preference for how you go about deciding on closure. Are you spontaneous and enjoy flexibility or do you Judge...need closure and plans. Are you an organized person?\n\nJordan Peterson has a nice talk about how people like us, Creatives or Intellectuals need to seek out a community, a coffee shop or like-minded individuals who want to have these conversations. I exhaust the sensors in my life with theory and philosophy and my "little lessons", sigh. Sometimes, a tomato is just a tomato.\n\nIt is etiquette. In the same way that we read micro-macro facial expressions, they read our body language and our body language is instinctively different. We need to speak the words that reassure or explain us to them.\n\n Sensors, who live in the here and now, they need this small talk to establish connections and understanding. \n\nRecently, I read that people are divided into three groups; Talkers+Touchers+Listeners. \n\nGuess which one you may be?
2	Your roommate immediately ditching when talking about feelings or things outside of her is probably a sign your roommate is a narcissist
1	Maybe they are using small talk to hide something that is hurting
1	man i get this dude. people at my school never talk about meaningful shit they just talk very 1 dimensionally. it sucks mannnn
1	UGH! I feel the same so often. And, it's not just the empty ‚ÄúHow are you‚Äù ‚ÄúGood, how are you?‚Äù ‚ÄúGood‚Äù ; I dismiss most of that as just cultural norm of greeting. It's in the majority of my interactions nowadays.
1	Yes and no for me. I hate idle talk, in the same way I hate people who don‚Äôt get straight to the point and mumble and try and hide true intentions behind bullshit words (I have asshole, lazy coworkers who do this). I do like small talk that is as a conversation starter, where I can start to add wit, and get to understand people much better and make them laugh and smile. That makes me feel good.
1	The average person is inferior and feels the need to fill silence with noise, because they have not yet learned to appreciate silence and it makes them feel uncomfortable when they must be self-reflective. \n\nBut there's not really any good reason not to indulge them, to show a little kindness for their broken state. 
1	My thoughts exactly. While I'm good at making small talks and certain situations do call for it, I despise them as they are mundane and shallow. When I talk to someone, I want to establish a real connection and have a meaningful conversation that actually makes each other think and get to know the other person better. Small talks bore me to death and feels like I'm wasting my time and energy. I can never bond with anyone who doesn't know how to hold a real conversation. 
1	I don't mind "small-talk" at all. The point of small-talk is to build rapport and comfort -- most people are not going to feel comfortable talking about deep topics with people they don't know that well, but they still want to connect, and thus they say something like 'how are you' or 'wow it's cold today' or whatever. It has nothing to do with shallowness. 
94	Recently took a personality test again after a few years to see if I was still ENFP, because I wanted to see if my personality had altered, and I AM still ENFP! Yay for test reliability. Just found this sub and feel at home after just a few scrolls. Power to you/us all!	
15	I usually test ENFP, but sometimes I get ENFJ, most often when I'm back visiting my parents house. I've lived away from them for 15 years or so, been married for 10, have 4 kids, but it's interesting how my personality seems change a bit based on my being back there. 
12	Actually tests are extremely unreliable. People are constantly getting all kinds of different results on different tests. You are much better off looking into the cognitive functions and finding your type yourself. It's pretty easy to do.\n\nhttps://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/if-youre-confused-about-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-read-this-an-intro-to-cognitive-functions/\n\nThen check this out: https://www.typeinmind.com/nefi/
9	I took it 3 times just to make sure and yeap still got that ENFP :) 
17	The test screwed up twice.  Yay \^_\^ !!!
5	I test myself every year or so, I alternate between ENFP and INFP. Fun to see the changes
3	I recommend doing research into the cognitive functions, tests are extremely unreliable, everyone gets a variety of results, and of which, none may be correct. 
2	That's great :) which website did you use? if you don't mind me asking
2	The test sucks to be honest. Half of my friends tested as ENFP and we‚Äôre all so different. I might be the only real one 
2	I usually test as INFP or INTP but I'm an ENFP
2	I took it again for fun once in a while. Always ENFP. It explains my behavior well and makes sense.
2	I've taken so many different versions of the test over the course of the past 4 - 6 years, and I always come out to be ENFP. When I was in my first year of college and going through SEVERE depression, that was the only time I tested as anything else (ISTJ).
11	Am I the only ENFP who gets his creative projects done?	yo so like i know that a lot of ENFPs go around, start projects, and never finish them and move to a new one. im never like that with my creative projects, i work on them a lot and i just finish them. i know i am an ENFP, i taken the test a bunch of times and always got ENFP and i relate to a lot of these post on the subreddit but the main thing that always confuses me is that a lot of you guys dont finish projects but i do? tell me your guy's thoughts, any other ENFPs are like me?\n\nEDIT: i may have a lot musical ideas i played with sitting around on my hard drive but they are no where near close to being presentable, its just 3 second loops. i dont finish them because its sucks or i am actually musically stuck with it
5	I finish a lot but i start a lot too. Its not about finishing always, its about trying it out and see how i like it. 
2	I actually have ADHD which makes it much harder to actually finish what I set out to do but I actually have finished some stuff! I‚Äôve written short stories and songs and made art work and I‚Äôm so proud of it. A lot of stuff I also don‚Äôt finish, but at least some stuff actually gets done. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs like a requirement or anything, just kind of an in-joke because we‚Äôre a group that tends to get bored and move on to the next thing fairly quickly.
2	I used to be like that, too! But ever since I moved out on my own, it got a lot harder. I don't know, I guess that back when I didn't have to worry about my own cooking and cleaning, I just used all that space for art and really got things done. But nowadays I have yet to find that ideal balance - sometimes I barely get the work done I actually get paid for. :')
2	I start more than I finish. \nThe excitement is higher at conception than competition for me. \nI get it done if I need to. 
1	Do you have any pieces of advice for the majority of ENFPs who don't get projects done?
1	I would say it's 50/50. I love to cosplay and I usually finish those, but whenever I write music or books I won't finish them
1	To many ENFP's the idea is just as good if not better than the actual execution of something. And we jump from idea to idea without actually getting a thing done. The details of actually finishing something can be so boring. And I think it is often about the process of creating rather than making a finished project so once we feel we have satisfied the craving that made us create one thing we move on to a new, different thing.
1	Nope.  Not the only one.  I always finish my creative projects.  I think this is true of young Enfps but after a while, your Si remembers all you wanted to complete and kicks your butt.
1	I don't - it's something I still struggle with. I could complete them if I forced myself, but oftentimes I just don't have the drive or feel the same way that I did when I came up with the idea. 
59	Bringing back this one back/ because *it fits*	
3	I watched almost the whole Office series, up to the point when Michael leaves; because of this sub.  I wanted to get a sense for what an ENFP is like, and it seems like the Office is a thought-experiment of 'what if an ENFP controlled an environment with impunity'.  \n\nI think if left to our devices, we can be cruel clowns who find both wonderful value and completely dissociative notions towards our fellow man.  This jump in emotion, it's based on a radically explosive empathy that is too easily distracted and provides too much impulse for the brain.  I found the Office horrifying, even though I found myself falling in love with all of the characters and trying to justify Michael's actions along with them.  \n\nI think that we are these spurs for magic in our own niche worlds, but it's a complicated mess because we create so much fervor and energy but don't know how to control, constrain and restrain ourselves.  It's kind of an awful existence to be the Pagliacci of magicians, but i think that's who we are.
4	ENFP - unsure of what career path to take	Hey everyone,\n\nSo i've finished high school and i'm about to enter university. I've chosen a commerce/advanced science (climate science major) double degree for now. However, I'm really unsure if its the right fit for me for many reasons. This is because first of all I've been hearing that prospects for science grads in Australia arent so good...and to be honest, I'm only doing commerce as I think that its transferable skills could help me out towards a career based on helping the environment, which I've decided would be my main focus. (e.g. environmental consultant, urban planning, environmental).\n\nRight now, I'm working in retail, and although its at times tiring, I really enjoy it as I get to help customers and be active. Thus I cannot imagine myself in an office, doing businessy stuff like accounting and finance, although theres a part of me that wouldn't mind helping businesses solve problems to do with their employees or finding a way to make a product more appealing to customers (basically anything on the social science side). \n\nInitially I wanted to be a physiotherapist, since I've always liked sports. However, its starting to get really saturated. Even then, there is demand for them, but I reckon most of the demand is in aged care...which isn't a sector I'd want to work in honestly, as it sounds boring.\n\nAlso, I had been considering other career paths like nursing, because although it may be very draining at times, the variety and social interaction could be enough to keep me going. I've also been thinking about landscape architecture, because it would allow you to make cities more green and liveable, and also since I've been drawing for fun recently. However I've talked to some people and they've said that its pay doesn't really compensate for the amount of work and the long hours involved. But then again every job has its drawbacks..\n\nSo I'm kind of at a loss as to which major I should do. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for my thoughts being all over the place, and sorry for sounding really pessimistic - i'm just confused and unsure of everything lol\n\nbtw, I did Software design in my senior years of high school, and I did not like programming, and hence was incompetent at it. So I don't think software engineering is a good major for me, even though some ENFPs excel in it.\n\n&#x200B;
6	My advice would be to not consider yourself locked in to anything or locked out of anything else. Most people have no idea what they actually want to do right after high school. And most people don't really need a grand career path to be happy in life. Sometimes people know, sometimes people go big, but it is not necessary to base your purpose in your career path. If you can pursue your purpose in your career, cool! But you can also volunteer, intern, start a side business or charity, write, protest, and throw your loose change at causes you believe are helping. Don't believe for a second that you have to have it figured out. You have a basic plan, you're good to go for now. You will likely change your plan a couple times at least and that is also good news because you'll be narrowing it down to something useful. Whether "useful" feeds into what job you get or what you bring to a volunteer based organization on the weekends, it's still good. \n\nCheer up, friend. The world stays big, even after you pick a major. ;)

2	Try being an undeclared major for a semester or year. You can take some core classes you need for every major along with unique electives to see what strikes your fancy.
2	My thought is not to worry about if a field is saturated or not. Otherwise you will head towards something that you may not really like. \nI work in a saturated field but have found a niche that allows me to charge more, have people wait  on my schedule and allows me to have fulfillment knowing I‚Äôm not  just another boring company. \nYou have unique qualities that if you can, exploit them (let your freak flag fly), you will stand out from the crowd. \nIt also helps to surround yourself with people that like to do the boring stuff like filling out forms and actually finishing things. 
1	you should do some shrooms.  shrooms are great at answering questions you already know the answer to but can't answer for yourself until you're there.  
8	ENFP‚Äôs behaviour when in love/in a crush	Hi ENFP‚Äôs! Just some questions about male ENFP‚Äôs that have a crush on a girl mid twenties. \nI read a lot about you getting shy when in a crush but imagine having a crush on a friend you‚Äôve known for like 6 years and text with everyday for the past 3 years....\nDo you like to provoke the girl to see her reaction a lot when you have a crush on her? \nDo you generally like to explain new things/create new experiences or do you only do that with a girl you have a crush on? \nDo you pay extra attention to the emotions/reactions/behaviour of the girl you have a crush on? \nJust asking for a friend (kidding of course)
3	Just to make sure I got this right, you're trying to find out if your friend of six years with whom you've been texting daily for the past three years?\n\nIf that's the case, I think it might be easier for you to describe how he acts around you so we can figure this out together :)
2	*imagine having a crush on a friend you‚Äôve known for like 6 years and text with everyday for the past 3 years....*\n\nHas your crush, excuse me. Has your friend's crush been texting you (them) for three years without moving forward?\n\nIs this texting the extent of the relationship, or has the/ your relationship evolved in anyway past this point?\n\nHas the crush invited the other person out for a friendly outing, included them with the other friends on a group activity? \n\nAre you both in the same geographical location or is the crush an online relationship?
2	Haha thank you for the many replies. I will give you some more details. \nWe have been friends and coworkers (makes things complicated) for 6 years but see each other almost everyday only since 6 months so we got more close.\nHe invites me over for every planned activity with other coworkers but also for some alone time now and then. Like coming over for dinner before we went to another coworkers house.\nWe also went to the casino where I had never been before and he had so much fun explaining me everything. Another colleague was also there for the first time but got none of his attention. When I am turning introvert for some reason he notices it immediately and asks if I am not in the mood to do something for example.\nHe also opens up more and more... calls me several times a week to ask how my day was. Makes sexual jokes sometimes and provokes me with questions. He asked me jokingly to look arrogant at him where I look at him up and down. He finds that very funny. He then asks ‚Äúyou like what you see?‚Äù I didnt answer that but he found that even more funny and kept asking that.\nSooo.... thats it for now I guess. I have many more details. \nHe is friendly and bubbly with everyone but I do believe it is different with me because we share so many interests and look at many things the same way.
1	Agreed - can you give us some more details? A lot of these questions can have different answers depending on the situation.
1	well, we do more info to help your friend here ;) wink wink wink, but\n\nAre we shy? not necessarily , I overthink a lot, and sometimes end up declaring my feelings too late, used to be worse when I was younger, but I learned to be more straight forward\n\nDo we provoke? hell yeah if I fee; comfortable enough, even with friends\n\nDo we like to create new experiences? Yeah with all friends, but usually if I like someone I do put a priority to adventure with her\n\nDo you pay extra attention? YES, a lot of extra, all the way extra\n\nJust kiss him already, youve know each other for long, and maybe he has always liked you, or maybe he just recently started to
1	I have actually managed to be in love with some women for 6 months without them ever knowing. It is possible, even for a direct enfp. For some reason I have some extreme rejection fears, so even when it was extremely clear for other people that a girl liked me, I didn‚Äôt see it. \n\nIn terms of attention. In my head I give an insane amount of attention to the woman. I think of her so much. In the real world it really depends. In social situation with the girl I tend to be all over he if I like her. Alternatively if I am feeling sad I retreat and I am very silent. \n\nMy point is, don‚Äôt let how he acts dissuade you. It can mean anything. I think there is quite a big chance he likes you, but don‚Äôt get mad at me if he doesn‚Äôt.
1	You're going to drive yourself crazy with this mentality. Do yourself a favor and kiss him (if you're bold) or tell him you're interested (slightly less bold) or start giving off your own non-verbal cues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo be honest, I DON'T THINK he likes you because ENFP are usually pretty bold if they are sold on you. But then again I might just be saying this to get you to prove me wrong. 
7	Fellow ENFP ladies, how do you feel around that time of the month/ deal with your period?	
11	I‚Äôm extremelyyyy emotional and moody right before it. I cry a lot but once I start my period, my emotions chill out. 
8	I have intense pms/pmdd so my mood swings are awful :( I drink a lot of raspberry leaf tea and I try to take extra care of myself and get enough sleep 
4	I get pretty intense PMS emotions and my body positivity goes on a roller coaster, one day in feeling pretty cute and fit and the next day it's "your fat and your legs are too big and manly" but now I'm used to it and tell my negative emotions to go eff themselves and just take extra time for myself, sleep a lot, workout (it helps with my cramps and emotions), and just generally remind myself that it's gonna pass soon and that I'm all good. Hope that made sense lol
3	It is bad. Really bad. 1st, there is the night of no sleep. It is the night before pms. I get absolutely no sleep, and I usually get 8-9 hours so that is rough for me, and it destroys my sleep schedule so I have a hard time going to bed on time the next 1-2 weeks.\n\nNext, the pms. If something even minisculey bad happens, (sometimes that is not even the case), I spend an afternoon crying and hermitting. It is like I have no control whatsoever of any emotions.\n\nNext day, I get my period, and it all clicks. I am no longer an emotional hot mess, and I now know why I was crying so much the prior day, which brings some comfort. But then comes the cramps. Imagine what it felt like if you pulled both of your lower back muscles, but they kept on wanting to move despite that. I am popping pain relievers all day. \n\nThen I go through the motions of the rest of my period until it goes away then comes again the next month. \n\nI really should track my period, but I keep on forgetting to, so when it comes, it comes rofl. 
3	I have really bad pms and then once my period starts I‚Äôll either be super crazy the whole time or super lethargic.
2	Mine gets pretty intense too- mood fluctuation, huge cravings too, irritability 
2	I‚Äôm mostly okay. I‚Äôm pretty good at controlling my emotions. Now and again I will get testy, but I‚Äôm quick to apologize when I snap at someone.
2	I got superr emotional and moody, lol. I've mellowed out a lot as I've gotten older, but it still hits me pretty hard. 
2	I don‚Äôt really get so angry, I just extra crazy/silly/hyper and people around me are wondering wtf I‚Äôm hyped up on üòÇü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

This 30 page book is only 12 chapters long, one chapter for each of the 8 styles of grip, a conclusion, and two introductory chapters.  Well the first book I linked to on amazon is a more in depth version of the article I linked to.
4	Avoid staying indoors, get out and do an activity and keep doing it several times
5	Go for a drive with friends
2	Playing creative games like Minecraft with friends, having some time to hang out at least once/twice a week, shopping, or eat yummy foods does help a lot for me!
2	Getting out of the house and hanging out in the company of others. Helping others also does a lot of good. Just small things where you can see the positive impact of your actions.\n\nYou want to feel important and valuable to society, which you are. Share that value with others. Even if it's a small thing. 
4	I feel like I unlearned how to feel my emotions in intimate relationships, help	A month or so ago a friend of mine (24F) from drama class told me (26M) her boyfriend broke up with her and despite her saying that their relationship was troubled, she is still really hurt and upset about it.\n\nLast night after our class we went out for drinks with some of our friends. As soon as we found a table, she quickly got herself a strong drink and proceeded to insist everyone joined her, saying she really wanted to get shit faced. It didn't take long until she started hitting on me. The thing is, I'm not into her.\n\nEven though we've become somewhat close, I'm not really attracted to her and only want her as a friend. At any rate, while I didn't reciprocate or just plain ignored her moves, she kept insisting with progressively more incisive moves until I eventually caved in and kissed her.\n\nNeedless to say, I didn't want to do that and even though it's been nearly a day, I feel like shit. I wanted to tell her I wasn't in the mood, or that I just saw her as a friend. I couldn't bring myself to do it, though, especially considering how messed up she was after her boyfriend dumping her. I forced myself to do it so this girl wouldn't have to think she's not good enough. So I caved and did us both a disservice since right afterward when she asked me if I didn't want that to have happened I said that lately, I hadn't been feeling a lot, which pissed her off. I meant that with no malice, I was just genuinely sharing what I felt with the intent to communicate "I'm not in the mood, sorry."\n\nI just wanted her to back off and chill, but of course, what she did instead was to tell people on our table "do you know what he just told me?" I mean, yeah, I'm pretty fucking pissed that she did that, but what's truly bothering me is that all this just confirmed that, in fact, my emotions seem to have left me. I had never been hit on by a woman like that before, and while I imagine this could really feed someone's ego, I just felt... nothing.\n\nOutside of my love life, I can experience all sorts of feelings, good and bad. For some reason, however, lately, I haven't really felt anything. I'm not insecure or anything, on the contrary, I'm very confident of myself, which I suppose only makes this weirder.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a rant or if I'm just venting, but I would love to know if someone recognizes what I'm talking about and how I can go through this. I spent the last decade of my life chastising my emotions, trying them to bow to logic and reason and I genuinely feel I unlearned how to come in contact with my emotions when it comes to intimate relationships. Thanks for reading, you guys. I love you all. <3
3	Hey man you sound like you are experiencing depression. I would suggest you try to go to therapy to try to see if you can find the ability to feel again.\n\nAs for your friend you just need to be completely honest with her. It may have seemed nice to kiss her and to not tell her the truth that you aren't interested in her but it's not kind. Sometimes you need to tell the truth and potentially hurt feelings for everyone involved to be true to themselves in the long run.
1	Ar√© you sure you just haven‚Äôt met people you are genuinely interested in?? Did you feel like you were ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to have feelings about her or something like that? She is only a friend, so why would you feel something if you‚Äôre not into her, you know? Or maybe I misunderstood how this example makes you feel that you have no emotions in intimate relationships...it doesn‚Äôt sound like this was any kind of intimate relationship. I‚Äôm only saying this because I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre depressed-it sounds simple: you‚Äôre not into her like that. No big deal. 
1	Adventure Time Sunday!	\n/r/ENFP! What shenanigans have you been up to this week? Any new adventures planned for the next?\n\nLet's here some stories!
4	Adding in fillers when talking with someone	Started to notice when someone is telling me something or explaining to me, I use words like hmm, okay, ohh, yeah yeah, oh ok, righht. Feels like im just rushing the conversation and by adding these tidbits im not listening as well. Any thoughts?
7	I use the same terms and I think most people do. I don't feel as if I'm rushing the conversation so much as showing them that I am still invested in the conversation and listening to them.
2	yaa, almost like pressing teh skip cutscene button. like, can we get to the next great cool thing already??
1	Feeds the ENFP with 5 minutes of distraction that will also generate great insight onto this subject.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UnIDL-eHOs\n\nThe key insight happens near the end of the video roughly 4:30 (near the conclusion) to explain why this word is so useful, why this word is so powerful.  Aka the most important point was saved for last so it is lingers in your memory.
289	Yup, that's me. Anyone else?	
61	This is almost insulting how accurate it is. I feel so attacked. 
27	yes. my husband asks me all the time ‚Äúhow does it feel to never finish anything?‚Äù. lol. \n\ni took up knitting so i‚Äôd actually be able to finish things on a regular basis. 
20	You need to learn the Shadow Clone Ninjutsu.  If ENFPs learn this technique they will be unstoppable.\n\nUntil you ENFPs run out of energy due to overuse and not using your inferior Si to recharge =D
15	Let's see, following are things I gotta do: \n\n1. Finish my book\n2. Write for my blog\n3. Learn coding\n4. Draw a comic\n5. Read a specific book\n6. Read a specific book #2\n7. Read the downloaded episode of a podcast (downloaded it yesterday)\n\nI guess these are plenty of tasks I have left in the middle. I don't know which ones I will finish though.
12	This is so me! I feel like I finally learned to manage it though. \n\nNow rather than never completing a previous task, I work on three or four at a time. I really enjoy my projects, so my break from one isn't just procrastinating anymore, it's continuing work on a different project and right now I finally feel as though I found a good balance of types of projects that I'm not really getting bored of any one thing and have just enough to keep a steady daily pace. This is what has worked for me :) 
13	Can I be frank for a minute? \n\nAs long as he already has a place to stay and enough material and space, I don't see the problem with just starting one structure after anoter...who says he has to finish? Maybe that's the source of joy for this person, exploring new ideas, rather than finishing them. Heck, I'm sure if someone came and told them they urgently needed a place to stay, he'd either offer them to take refuge at his crib or just finish a house for them. But for now, there seems to be no *'reason'* to finish....namean?\n\nCUT THIS PERSON SOME SLACK, jesus.
3	See, the trick is to stick to ten things, and then keep going through the haphazard loop haphazardly replacing finished things with new things. :D
3	As an INFJ, I admire this so much about ENFPs, although I have known plenty of ENFPs who do finish projects (with the exception of the deadline being right around the corner). :‚Äô) Anyhow, it‚Äôs always a reflection of your creativity which is so wonderful.
3	Hey, we'll get back to the other thing. Eventually.
2	Someone tell me how to stay disciplined lol
2	I FEEL PERSONALLY ATTACKED
1	Painfully true
1	Guilty ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1	Also me trying to be a reader. I spend more time adding to my book collection than reading it. If it's not in the first 2 chapters I'll never know what it says... 
1	Painfully accurate. I usually jot down my to do for the day. I end up doing a little bit of everything, but not actually finishing anything. I have to actually force myself to finish even one. 
1	For what it's worth, I'm an ENTP and this really seems more true to ENTPs, as we are known for juggling between ideas and never really following through with a single one (unless were arguing or trying to prove a pointüòÇ ). I can totally realte to this!!! But I also have noticed that ENTPs and ENFP are REALLY similar in a lot of ways.
1	Literally me with my yard projects rn üòÖ
2	Book: The Empath Experience	Has anyone read this? I've just started it and it's crazy how much of my personality and routine it touches on. I'm in my 30's and just now realizing how messed up I've been my whole life trying to fit in to society. I can't wait to finish this book. Wonder if anyone else (or if all ENFPs) relate to being empaths.\n\nFor readers, I'd love some insight whether personal or overall review. What other book(s) have helped you?
1	My mom is a seriously empathic person but she's an INFP.  I am an ENFP, but I don't think I'm an empath. I love to understand people but I can't do it instinctively on my own. I observe and I engage, then test out theories of connectivity until I feel I've gotten close to the truth. 
1	I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm an empath. I can‚Äôt really ‚Äúfeel‚Äù what other people are feeling but I‚Äôm good at being sympathetic and kind\n\nI try to be nonjudgemental and have been told that I‚Äôm easy to talk to
9	ENFP keeps mention about me ‚Äúfuture boyfriend?‚Äù	this enfp i‚Äôve been talking to somehow finds every reason to make comments about my love life. (it‚Äôs non existent btw) he knows i haven‚Äôt had a bf before, yet he keeps joking that i might‚Äôve. he says stuff like ‚Äúgood pick up line (we were joking around) you should use it on your crush or future bf‚Äù i also made this thing i told him i‚Äôd give to my future bf and sometimes he brings it up saying stuff like ‚Äúoh now i see why you made that for your future bf.‚Äù what is this supposed to mean? i know not every enfp is the same but i just want some feedback? i don‚Äôt know how to read this person
8	Hahaha he may just like joking around, or he may like you, ask him if he likes you, he'll probably like talking about feelings either if he likes you or not in a romantic way, the talk will make you guys closer
8	He's either flirting with you or just being nice. He might not even know which. Sorry.
4	My entp friend did something like that all the time. When we encountered a single guy, like a new acquaintance, he makes a comment like ‚Äúyou guys should date‚Äù, like out of no where, and make things super awkward. I think he enjoys how it makes other people uncomfortable. He is teasing you. If it is like ghat I would just play along and go further. Say something like ‚Äúactually it is for you‚Äù or something. Or ‚ÄúYou are welcome to use it yourself‚Äù
2	He likes you and wants to be your future boyfriend. If he keeps saying it... it‚Äôs obviously occupying his mind
1	It's a joke he doesn't realise isn't very good. It kinda implies though that you are good enough to have a bf at any point and that he is sure of it. Somebody joked around with me about gfs, which I had none of and I found it to be a bit overwhelming because I am kinda sad I had none, but I had to joke around about having one all the time. (T)He(y) stopped after.
1	He could like you. Or he is just a good friend and wants you to be happy with someone in a relationship and is trying to be encouraging. Could be either. You'll have to ask him not us. :p
67	One of you guys, I think :D	
22	deciding that random pinata is exactly what you need to make your whole day perfect, as if its been waiting for you your whole life? Failing to think about the logistics of the plan? Falling back into an existential crisis only moments later? sounds about right
12	ENFP: Ooh, hang on...let me just get this one little thing....
5	Lol, ENFP husband basically did something similar to this swatting at a fly... broke a lightbulb that exploded all over he place into the tub on the chandelier in our bathroom.
6	This is meant as playful. Love ya.
3	Yep. That's usüòÇ He didn't even check to see if any managers or workers are watching lol. #whatadaredevil
2	Hahahah üòÇ
2	Pfft. Ne would have constructed a way better way to get this down 
3	ESFP
1	No, I would have thought of a creative, efficient way to get it down. Maybe an immature ENFP might do this.
3	ENFP for sure...	
2	Wait... is that not how you supposed to coffee? 
17	My interpretation of my moods as an ENFP	
3	from left to right. a e s t h e t i c, beautiful, blob boi (or gorl), and metal overall, AMAZING ART!!
2	The Si-Fi HAHAHA so trueee. \nthis is cool!!! What does the Ne-Te mean to you? 
2	A mermaid with wings for Ne-Te ?
2	I love the blob
6	Brainstorm on Google docs	I love Google docs, oh man I have brainstormed so much at random times, I am so glad it is there on my docs, almost every single time!\n\nWhat are some cool things that you have brainstormed using google docs?\n\nI have written a few attempts of my fictional novel, questions for dating and getting to know people, questions for self discovery and self reflection, emotional processing guide, rough draft of self help book, anime shows that were epic, 
2	I DO THIS EXACT THING! I have schedules and ideas and 5 years plans. 
1	Yesss... I created a whole Values workbook taking exercises from a few diff worksheets I found online. I come back to this every so often and write down wya by which I like living each of them and defining my boundaries with it too. \n\nI can share the template if anyone is interested.\n\nPs. Airtable, Notion and Mural are also some of my fav tools
1	I use Yahoo Notepad. But honestly I usually just send things to my self as emails for later, either from my phone or my email right back to itself. I have like 2000 unread emails I sent myself of ideas and things.
8	ENFP-INTJ relationship	Guyss! Have you ever been in a relationship with an INTJ? Tell me your stories! I'm an INTJ currently in love with an ENFP
9	Okay, I'll bite.\n\nBeing in a relationship with my INTJ has been so awesome, and I love her to bits.\n\nWe met on Tinder (lol) and I convinced her to meet up with the prospect of a picnic in a park. Well, two hours beforehand I realized I hadn't planned well enough to make it to the store on time for food, but I had scowered the town I was in for the absolute best green tea I possibly could. I came to the date with a canteen of iced green tea, two mugs, and told her to eat beforehand. We went to a park, and then went to a bubble tea shop on a whim, and then we watched the sunset at a tall parking garage. She expected way different but said it was very romantic lol, and we hit it off great and within two weeks we were dating. Six months later here we are.\n\nThere are a lot of stories I could tell. She really has helped me to become a more grounded person, and I do really love her.\n\nThere was another time where it was her birthday and I wanted to surprise her. I made her believe I was busy at an event for an organization I usually go to but I got out of it and secretly bought candles, flowers, stuff like that. I went to the restaurant and asked them to set up a table for us with the candles and the flowers and that I would be bringing her by in about 25 minutes. I picked her up, took her to this nice restaurant, and she melted. She loves how spontaneous I can be sometimes. Honestly, I didn't have that much of a plan the day before hah.\n\nAnyway, there's so many wonderful times I've had with her, it's hard to choose, and there are countless small fun moments we've had. We made a pillow fort and played video games in her living room once, and that was really awesome. If prompted for more I could think of some more stories.
4	I was with an intj once and it was very boring and I dumped him after 2 months of dating. 
3	I think my ex was an INTJ. It was a great relationship for the first 6 months, but circumstances got a bit crazy and she revealed her bad side... both of our bad sides which were irrespective of personality types. You can see my post history ;( \n\nHowever those 6 months? EPIC. It's like we completed each other. We could even "read each other's minds." 
2	I went on one date with an INTJ and was not interested. But I felt like he was just checking off boxes and saw ENFP and thought " oh, they are compatible with me" and didn't care about me as a person so ew. (Also several other things)
1	One, two, three, four!	
7	Tiranosaurous Rex!\n\n\nü¶ñ \n Did I got it right?\n\n\nI just wanted to use that emoji... \n\n\n\n\nü¶ñ\nHere it is once again\n\n\n\nü¶ñ\nShit! Fucking hide your children he is not stopping! \n\n\n\n\nü¶ñ \nAaAAAaaandkflsljslshdhzlzxbxn.... \n

67	Getting lost in time?	Does anyone else here lose track of time super easily? \n\nIf I'm interested in something I'm researching or I find a place to walk around etc. I feel like day spills into night without my noticing.. there's just not enough hours. And it's so hard to go to bed before 3am so maybe it's a sleep schedule thing too? 
13	hashah, its 2am, im supposed to be in bed 2 hours ago, also, i end up late for work a lot because of this shit. how does 15min shower turn into an hour!?!?!?!?
4	Sometimes I feel like I've been doing something for hours and then like just a minute passed
3	There are definitely not enough hours in the day. I hate feeling time constraints.
4	I notice this mostly after I've been hanging out with a good group of friends having a beer and great conversation and then all of a sudden it's 4am :)\n\nI also find that it happens with work. I will get deeply engrossed in a topic and I'll miss an appointment/meeting or be late-ish. I've noticed that I have these moments where I get a prolific amount of work product done and then I'll think about something for weeks and have another "moment". During these times I will lose track of time and I don't really care about the world around me because I have to be in the moment taking advantage of the momentum/energy/inspiration. 
3	Yea when I'm really engrossed in something I lose track of time very easily.  
3	Yes that's meeee
3	Yes, definetely need more hours per day. There's just so much I want to do and also get enough sleep.
3	Time is an illusion.
2	yes!!!!!!
2	[deleted]
2	There is always more we could do. Going to bed can be frustrating. I know I can just do it tomorrow but maybe I'll watch one more Netflix show...
1	(Survey) Relationship Between Personality Type and Drug Use	
3	having a single drug of choice makes me doubt the design of this survey. Not many drug users I know that aren't multitaskers
1	Dam this is really interesting...hm relay some information of your findings after you get a sizable amount of responses.
1	None.
6	What kind of music do you guys listen to & how important is music in your life?	Hey fellow ENFPs! So I had this random thought: *Do personality traits influence the type of music one's into?* Let's open up a little discussion, mainly for the sake of curiosity & fun. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What genre(s) of music do you guys love, and what element of songs (e.g. instrumentation, lyrics, rhythm, melody, form, timbre, etc) is most important for you?  Also, how important is music for you in your life?** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for me, I pretty much listen to everything from classical to EDM, going through phases of exploring a specific genre at a time, mostly dependent on my general mood. But my favorite genre has always been hard rock & modern metal; metalcore would be my favorite sub-genre of metal, and it's what I always end up going back to. I take importance in lyrics more than anything else; there's nothing more comforting than listening to music that I relate to. I love songs with complex, poetic lyrics that makes me ponder about what the writer must've been thinking & feeling while they wrote that song, and love exchanging interpretations of the lyrics with others. Music has always been an outlet of my emotions & I just CANNOT live in a world without it lol
3	99% of the time I listen to The Weeknd. Apart from that i listen to instrumentals and R&B.
3	I love metal! the elements that are most important for me is the way the melodies can convey so many feelings of empowerment, violence, melancholy, I love the way the songs progress in metal, how the song can take so many turns, in the bridges, solos, interludes and headbanging breakdowns, its amazing, specially because I cant stand monotone songs that are just one beat and one riff all throughout. 
3	I am big on lyrics too!!! The message of the song matters more to me than anything else. There are some songs that just have a catchy tune that I like too, but the songs I LOVE have a message behind them. Top bands/artists for me include Colony House, A Great Big World, The Rocket Summer, Owl City, David Archuleta, Ben Rector, AJR, and, most recently, Alec Benjamin. \n\nI also like One Direction and Pink. Not all of their stuff but I REALLY like some of their stuff. Haha. \n\nI also love lots of Musicals (all Disney, Greatest Showman, Dear Evan Hansen, both Mama Mias (I know that is technically Abba music, but I like the movie versions...and the versions by the A Teens) Guys and Dolls, Saturday's Warrior, etc.), classical music, film scores (Harry Potter series in particular... but the new Spiderverse movie has an awesome one and so does Tron), and the Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square. There are also specific songs that are from movies that I love too... like the one Matilda dances to and the one at the end of Little Monsters with Fred Savage. \n\nPlus, I love Youtube and being able to find random non-mainstream talent. Peter and Evynne Hollens, Piano Guys, Lindsey Stirling, Schmoyoho, Cinematic Pop, and Vocal Point are a few of my favorites. \n\nAlso, the greatest popular song of my childhood is a tie between "Larger Than Life" by the Backstreet Boys and "Blue" by Eiffel 65. Back then I think I cared more about aliens and spaceships than about quality lyrics... I also was a big fan of Aaron Carter though, but these were dark times. \n\n\n
3	Ok so music is obviously very important despite me not actually knowing how to play any instrument myself. This seems contradictory but I‚Äôve tried dabbing in guitar and piano and it just never happened, although according to my dad I have an ear for music. \n\nMusic helps set my mood mostly. I can‚Äôt listen to a happy song if I‚Äôm feeling angry, sad or introspective. Any previous mood goes out the window and I usually immerse myself in the song completely, sometimes to the point where I‚Äôm walking down the street and feel like a mood or character from a song. Because music has such a powerful influence over me, sometimes I limit my exposure to it. If I‚Äôm feeling depressed and don‚Äôt want to wallow in self-pity I stop myself from listening to The National, or Nick Cave, etc. \n\nI‚Äôm not sure what I look for in music but bursts of emotion seem to do it for me, The songs that make me feel and cry the hardest usually have this... sort of like a build up to an explosive chorus. But I mostly like pop, rock and shoegaze. The dreamier the better. I love day-dreaming and imagining scenarios.  My favourite bands (so far) are Beach House, New Order, Kero Kero Bonito, The Pillows, Mitski, Cocteau Twins, Joy Division and The Cure (and The National, sometimes). I also use music to help move my body. It‚Äôs very common for me to need to do something quick, pop an upbeat song and get it done. But in silence it seems like torture... A sense of rhythm and narrative seems to be really important for me. \n\nOk!!! There is one thing that really pisses me off. When a good song has a person‚Äôs name in it. It‚Äôs such a turnoff, I don‚Äôt know how to explain it.
3	Music is one of the most important things in my life. I don't know what I'd do if I went deaf lol. I play guitar, bass, ukulele, piano, drums as well as play around with making beats on Audacity and FL Studio.\n\nAs for listening to music, I'll listen to anything but most country. My favorite genres are alternative, rock, and lo-fi.
2	Music was the most important  thing to me for years until I turned 25 and got a serious girlfriend and for what ever reason has faded a bit, though I still listen and get excited about it nearly everyday. I love the lyrics and always have, I like to interrupt their meaning and what they are describing. But I also like the movement of energy in a song, like when the instrumenting picks up and the singing gets slightly more aggressive.  When the vocalist has a style that hell randoml;y get very intense(sort of screaming) for just a line or two and then back to normal , I love it! My Chemical  Romance, Bright Eyes, and Manchester Orchestra do it the best.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLove the National!! his voice is amazing and he seems really sensitive and its gets me deep.  blink-182 was my favorite growing up(have a tattoo of their logo). LCD Soundsystem is some of the best music I have ever heard.\n\nMore weird stuff - Boards of Canada and Burial.  Rival Dealer by Burial is unbelievable to listen to in the quite dark. Also Ulrich Schnauss  
2	Down-tempo dark pop.\n\nBut Also sometimes bubblegum pop.\n\nThen sometimes pop punk.\n\nOccasionally techno.\n\nI move around a lot.
2	I love almost any genre. When I was younger I was into country, and now I‚Äôm more into indie singer songwriter and generic pop songs. I love songs you can dance to. 
2	I need music with a good voice. I can't really enjoy instrumental that long and don't like metal or screamo or anything. I don't like metal singing either, for some reason that strange half-Broadway tone just gets on my nerves. And I only like some rap. I really need an  good voice where I can feel the feeling in it and good lyrics.\n\nI listen to a lot of different stuff but more op focused, whether radio pop, indie pop, or pop rock. I listen to a lot of female artists more than male, and a lot of singer-songwriters but also bands. My favorite is Fiona Apple. I also love Paramore, Kate Nash, She & Him, Panic! at the Disco, My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy, Jack's Mannequin. I also listen to people like Taylor Swift, Demi Lovato, and other more mainstream pop.\n\nI'm a 32 year old guy btw. :p
2	I like a little bit of everything, I don't know if I could say a 'wide variety' but I love soft rock/rock from the 70s a lot, very freeing and unique.  I only like a handful of 80s songs.. I like contemporary Christian, Classical, even a *little* bit of Baroque.. Oh! I also love it when Rock blends some orchestra type feeling to it, like 'Live and Let die' for ex. by Paul McCartney, or ELO music, I definitely enjoy the composition and subtle dynamics of the music itself more than the lyrics. I don't really like rap, or pop.. I like 90s country sometimes, I went through a phase for it like two years ago.. I like video game music, Celtic vibey music, This is just a very brief overview of some of it because I'm going to go make something to eat, now you have me wondering why I like certain things.. but love this question.
1	Looking at the amount of comments, you really hit a soft spot on all of us!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor me it's also all over the place:\n\n\-Techno, it varies techno is just so versitale\n\nDavid august [https://open.spotify.com/artist/1cS5EoXVqz7aON00AkVBBA](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1cS5EoXVqz7aON00AkVBBA)\n\nHe has a history of being a composures and it show in his relaxing techno\n\nI HATE MODELS [https://open.spotify.com/artist/1cS5EoXVqz7aON00AkVBBA](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1cS5EoXVqz7aON00AkVBBA)\n\nThis is guy makes grim hard pounding techno and I love it. Especially "it will last forever"\n\n\- Rock\n\nRed Hot Chilli Peppers\n\nJust love their chill and hard going vibe, their newest album is also da shit\n\nBryce Fox\n\nNice and slow kinda jazz like\n\nAND SOOOO MUCH MORE, but I should get back to my homework. You should really check out david august and I HATE MODELS, it's almost like therapy for me
1	Fleetwood Mac (**especially The Chain**), Zac Brown Band, Tom Petty, The Weeknd, Brothers Osborne(21Summer, I don't remember me), Peter Frampton(While My Guitar Gently Weeps), Lynyrd Skynyrd are my tops. I think you'd like Junkyard and Heavy is the Head by Zac Brown Band if you like Hard Rock. 
3	Can an ENFP become a web developer?	Hi, I'm an enfp and I was wondering if you guys can help me out? I'm very confused regarding my career.
6	An ENFP can become anything.
1	I have read that web development is dynamic and helps things stay interesting for ENFPs. I love to play with SQL coding if that helps.
1	I am an ENFP web dev, so I'd say so!\n\nHere are some reasons why I think it makes a good fit:\n\n\- it's dynamic, ever-changing and, once a developer, there are dozens of different specializations to take. It will rarely get boring.\n\n\- it's an incredibly portable skill which allows location independent work better than any other job. \n\n\- with our people skills, ENFPs can be very valuable members in tech teams, which (it is true) are often full of IxTx types. Diplomatic intelligence, an ENFP's strength, is often sorely needed and highly appreciated.\n\n\- should an ENFP dev decide to freelance, their people skills once again help to set us apart, as self-branding, marketing and keeping relationships with clients is often the part that other developers dislike or aren't as naturally good at.\n\n&#x200B;
1	Yes, like any other human
4	In what areas do you inspire others?	We're known as "campaigners" or "champions". We're described as making others want to follow us when we believe in something strongly enough. And with the infinitely diverse areas of interests of ENFPs, there's got to be one of us that's a great advocate for every subject out there (for me, it's reading and libraries; but I've been told I inspire others to be more creative or pursue their passions).   \nSo I'm curious! What are your specialties, fellow inspirers?
3	For me, it‚Äôs music :) But also being a teacher and helper everywhere I can. I like to learn and then spray the information.
3	I've been told I inspire people to be their authentic selves.
2	I care about animal rights as well as feminism, social equality and equal opportunity, gay rights, racial equality and basically anything that allows the downtrodden and oppressed and disenfranchised to get a chance at the table and to get equal opportunity.
1	I hope within my faith as that is my passion, I also regard psychology and learning in general highly, so encouraging learning. 
3	Can I get some help with my ENFP teen?	He's sixteen, since he's started high school it's been one bad decision after another. I've tried every punishment I can think of, nothing works. For the most part I've always let him learn from his mistakes, and try to give him as much freedom to make his own decisions as possible, but at this point he's going to end up ruining his life. What do I have to do to get thru to him? Any advice would be appreciated, thanks.
3	What are is hobbies? Who does he hang out with? An ENFP will turn *bad* by being around bad people, the Ne and Fi will usually blind a person to others faults and a developing Te means they will rely on others to tell them what to think. An ENFP can be pretty easily manipulated by people who know how to exploit them, particularly younger ones. \n\nI also don't know the exact situation (and don't need to) but want to reflect on how your son is his own person and perhaps what you find to be bad decisions based on your own logic and systems may be very different in his perspective. Obviously there are some bad decisions and behaviors that are more objectively bad than others (opiate addiction/drug use that interferes with school, being abusive or toxic in relationships or friendships, being rude to those they perceive as beneath them, just to name a few). So I just want you to reflect on whether you are frustrated at your son taking a different path than you want him to take, or if what he is doing is really bad for himself and those around him. 
3	Is he open to talking to you? I hated listening to my parents when I was younger because they would always lecture me and never asked me how I felt or why I was doing the things I was doing, which meant they also gave me useless advice because it wasn‚Äôt relevant. If you do talk to him, make sure you really listen. When you think you understand what he‚Äôs saying, ask again. Especially if he‚Äôs young, he might not even know what he means so it might take some time to get to the bottom of it. Be patient. Time was the thing I always craved from my parents, and never got. 
2	If punishment doesn't work (it rarely ever does with anyone), try incentive. Rewards for good behavior. Because otherwise he has no reason not to do bad stuff besides fear of punishment, which frankly is not much. But if you give him something to drive toward, something to work for he will have a goal and a reason to stick the course.
1	enfp teen here. I dont know the \*exact\* situation that he is in, but no matter what it is, communicate to him how \*you\* feel about the situation. Furthermore, let him talk to you about how he feels about the situation. Punishments would probably make us feel belittled, and that you are "the man" that we have to fight. Hope this helps!!
3	graphic designer here , hows your working life?	hey my fellows, I'm enfp just got my first job last October,as a designer in company , mostly graphic design but I also needs to do some window design. project decorations etc, my company has four brands so I overwork almost everyday. id like to know how other graphic designers ' working life are? is it common?\n\nso okay..I today feel especially bad because I am asked to make two window designs and one enviornment decoration in..one and a half day...... and last time, I had to think and make 7 interior printings for a brand new restaurant in almost a week (while still have other project on hands). my manager still think I'm not fast enough and its duty to finish things on time no matter if I need to overwork, because if the outside decorations aren't attractive enough, people won't come in to have meals and company has to waste thousands a day because I can't keep the whole project on time (its because  I have lots of other design to do)\n\nI'm really in conflicted about keeping the quality and the quantity , tbh I rather overwork and work more hrs on each project so I have qualified design, one day I can show my portfolio and be a freelancer. but still I'm adjusting and balancing myself ,because deadline is deadline ...  in my country , leaving office on time is very rare, and design industry is notorious for overworking. how about other graphic designers working life here? thanks
1	I'm probably not going to be much help, but these are all the reasons I left the industry there was far too much demand for quantity over quality, customers never listen to your professional advice & bosses expected you to stay and finish the days work, which wouldn't ever be so bad if there weren't 20+ projects every single day. \n\nI couldn't find a good work/life balance and, for me, sacrificing my quality and dealing with pretentious, untrained know-it-alls wasn't satisfying at all. I was always happier freelancing but our market here for even freelancers is really saturated & difficult to compete in. \n\nIf you have a chance to do in-office work as a professional & it doesn't suck the life out of you, then congratulations I'd stick to it as long as possible and make some really solid connections that really appreciate your private work so when you do leave to freelance you have a good customer base and word of mouth already going on about your work; already be thinking about your own marketing and branding, what you'd do differently with your own customers, how you'd approach projects on your own vs in shop. \n\nGood luck! Don't let the customers suck the life out of your soul. 
79	My mom (INFJ) and I got our auras photographed!!	
35	ü§î
18	Guys I know stuff like astrology and auras and chakras and Wicca and ouija and tarot and anything that is basically magic is REALLY appealing and can be super fun, but we gotta keep a level head and remember that that‚Äôs all it is. It‚Äôs fun. It‚Äôs not real. As much as I‚Äôd like for magic to be real, it‚Äôs not. \n\nEven MBTI is kind of magic-y and only has some validity because your type is based on how you act, unlike astrology where they tell you how you act based on your type. \n\nI say this because it‚Äôs really easy to get taken advantage of by charlatans if you truly buy into this kind of magic. Hate to say it, but this is pretty obvious fraud, and I think OP kind of knows it :/\n\nYou tell from several things. 1. The colors all have the same level of saturation and are of the same color palette. If this were real don‚Äôt you think there‚Äôd be much more variety? 2. If you look at the edges of the colors, they have only a couple variations of shapes. The edges of the clouds have the same exact divets in many different pictures. 3. Double exposure is very literally how they made fake ghost photos in the late 1800s/early 1900s. They‚Äôre basically admitting to being frauds. \n\nI hate to be such a downer but some of these comments seem so genuine and believing and it‚Äôs difficult to see people I empathize with so much not recognizing fakery for what it is. \n\nI get it, I really do. I‚Äôve always been fascinated with this stuff and I love doing tarot cards and ouija boards and pagan rituals and shit like that. But you HAVE to remember that it‚Äôs not real. It‚Äôs just fun. 
9	This is really cool
4	wat
5	 Not that I believe in auras bit I wish I was having an INFJ mother instead of ISTJ
3	If you enjoy a bit of self-deprecating humour, you should post this on r/intj and r/intp as well...
4	Haha, I've done this before. My colors came out pretty similar...\n\n[http://oi63.tinypic.com/11vjomo.jpg](http://oi63.tinypic.com/11vjomo.jpg)
6	Seems about right XD\n\nI usually 'associate' infj's with a deep hue, something dreamy / mysterious 
2	This makes sense lol
1	yikes
1	wow this is really interesting.
1	Hey you and I have similar auras ! Mine is indigo in the center and yellow on the outside. My friend read my aura. This is so cool though. I wanna get this done
1	I wonder what my aura color is?
7	Slowed my mind	Just had this very bizarre feeling. Usually my mind is a rush and trying to figure out anything is near impossible without writing it down/externally visualizing it. I was trying to remember something I was looking for 10 seconds before and just told my mind ok, slow it down and retrace your steps. My mind the. Went in slo-mo mode, with a single voice of consciousness slowly talking through what i was just doing. And boom, figured out what i wanted to ask (wanted to post a question if there is a reddit for finding historical art pieces, trying to identify a sculpture of medusa i learned about in college that i cant find anywhere. \n\nAnyway, off to bed. Treat ya minds well compadres
3	God! I relate to this so hard! I'm constantly getting random impulses to search or do stuff and then something else breaks my train of though and I have to stand there like an asshole completely still trying to remember  saying "what was I gonna do? " my roommate laughs all the time, I usually remember by slowly retracing the things I was thinking before I lost the train of thought and finally I will reconnect the dots and remember! It feels mmm mmm so good for some reason. 
2	How old are you? I find most ENFP's are more zoom-minded and hard to focus when younger, all Ne, but when teens discover more Fi, which doesn't necessarily help, it just adds more to think about and feel about. But when you get into your twenties and late twenties you start to develop your Te and are able to focus and become more organized and efficient. Then in your 30's and after you develop your Si and learn the value of routine and can really focus even more.
42	ENFP who needs emotional depth in other relationships. Anyone feel the same?	I‚Äôve had maybe two people in my life whom I have connected with deeply, emotionally, physically, and psychologically in a relationship. One completely broke me and it took me over two years to process that emotional connection; It was so deep we read each other‚Äôs minds. \n\nI have great friends, very social, have a lot of dating experience, and I can connect with people very easily. In general, though, I feel people‚Äôs‚Äô thoughts when they touch me (once things become intimate) and I don‚Äôt like feeling objectified. It‚Äôs makes me really sad about the prospect of being with a man, as if very few really emotionally intelligent men exist. \n\nI actually, gasp, went on a date with a trans person recently. No connection, really, but I wasn‚Äôt objectified at least. I keep an open-mind. \n\nI‚Äôm cute,  intelligent, well-read, humble, kind, and finishing my education. I have a huge heart, but sad at the idea of being actually alone romantically. And I have many people in my life who would love to date me, but it‚Äôs just not there for me. \n\n\n\n\n
19	If you're in college, that's really peak hookup culture. Male people get better at being real people from there on out.\n\nThe bad news is you're cool and smart and warm hearted. That's hard to find. If you were a shallow boring normie you'd have partners up the ying yang.  Being cool sucks 
9	I feel the same way. I‚Äôve dated a lot of sensing types and over time it‚Äôs okay - but it‚Äôs not super special. It feels like you both just don‚Äôt get each other. So you can‚Äôt truly give your heart and mind completely without feeling like there‚Äôs something better. \n\nDating nfp types makes me feel so connected though.. but it feels like in a normal working society I rarely meet them. (From my experiences they‚Äôre usually designers, artists who you meet through networking / friends but never out in social environments) \n\nFor friends it‚Äôs a mixture of both. Different friends help with different activities, hobbies, and interests. I‚Äôve never belong to a big friend group so it‚Äôs nice having some surface level connections because they can be fun but also a lot of deeper ones for 1 on 1 coffee meet ups, brunches, introspective chats etc. 
6	Yeah, meeting and casual dating is easy for me but meeting that someone who seems to check all the boxes is a rarity. One of the reasons learned about MBTI. It helped thin down the dating pool on online dating and made it easier to find what I was looking for.  \n\nI first find someone with the similar values and interest, then personality traits I find attractive. I tend to go for INTJs but INFJs might be more what you are looking for. Unfortunately they are the rarest of the MBTI. Check out r/infj and see what you think. 
5	Yes, I'm only 20 yet still crave deep connections over everything else. I can be very forgiving with other negative qualities if that connection is there. \n\nThat's definitely an enfp thing. We are the most introverted extroverts due to Fi!
4	I feel you 100% 
2	"I‚Äôm cute, intelligent, well-read, humble, kind, and finishing my education. I have a huge heart, but sad at the idea of being actually alone romantically." 100% me but dude version.
2	I don't know how you feel about this but have you tried online dating? You can cut through all the bull and really find someone you are compatible with. You can start really getting in depth with each other in a way that doesn't happen as easy (if at all) meeting and dating in person. All my relationships have started online, either through dating sites (OKCupid is free and good), or other places like Twitter or Omegle chat. I met my current girlfriend in an online Cards Against Humanity game.\n\nWhen you are communicating online there is a freedom. There is no pretense and because you can't be physical yet you have to focus on your minds and hearts and a deeper connection. I've learned things about people they have never told anyone and gotten closer very quickly than some real life couples I've seen that were together for years.\n\nAnd when you do meet in person? No regular casual date with a stranger can match that magic.
2	You sound just like me. I have had very few deep connections as well, the few I did have also took me ages to get over. 
2	This is my life 10000000000%%% holy mother YOU ARE NOT ALONE. This is seriously why I come here hahah 
2	I've been feeling the same way a lot, OP. Even post-college, most people tend to be like that (in my experience). I feel objectified a lot and it's super rare to meet people I actually like and have a real connection with. My partner and I hit it off right off the bat, and I feel really emotionally connected with him, but right now we're in different countries and it's so hard - like we can video chat and send each other dumb memes and stuff, but it's just not the same. \n\nI've really only had deep/profound connections with other Intuitors to be honest (not that I haven't tried dating Sensors, but I just find them to be kind of boring in general), and since we're already kind of rare to begin with + I'm picky, I end up in similar situations as you: a lot of people want to date me/are interested, but it feels really shallow (I'm in an open/poly relationship). I hang out on this sub because I have no one I really connect with irl now that my boyfriend is gone and I'm tired of trying, honestly. 
8	Nightowls	I am self-employed, so I make my own schedule.  I find myself gravitating towards the overnight shift.  I'm not sure why, but I can't get anything done all day; then 9pm comes around and I get antsy and I start to work and I have a really good rhythm.  Usually it will last until 5 or 6am.  Anyone else?
2	I usually stay up all night, sleep all day. I go to bed at 7/7:30am and get up at 3 or 4 pm. Whenever I try to change my schedule I always drift back. I prefer the night. It is quiet and peaceful and not so bright and intrusive. That's when I get my alone time.
1	Me too. I realized too many distractions make me weak. Like literally take my energy away. So I keep moving around and procrastinating. The best thing is get myself a small private room with nothing in it(rent office). It calms me down and relaxes me. 
1	Me too! I‚Äôm more productive during this time and sometimes I like the quietness away from the distraction. It‚Äôs hard though with friends and a partner who functions on ‚Äúnormal time schedule‚Äù. They don‚Äôt like me sleeping during the daytime. But I need my rest! 
20	I feel like some of my fellow ENFPs would enjoy my drawings. we all like bright colors right? let me know what you think	
2	Love these
2	I love the mountains and the moon!
1	Keep working on defining your own personal style, I see you have potential, its very unique! 
1	This is dark. I like it. \n\nYou should share this with r/infp, it's right up their alley. 
1	I really love all the red ones
1	Nice.
1	Love your work! You are very talented. 
5	How do you motivate yourself to finish something well?	I love doing things that require skill, like playing the piano. However, I have a hard time motivating myself to finish something perfectly, like learning a piano song well enough to play it in public. \n\nHow do you motivate yourself when what you are doing loses its excitement?
1	Learning an instrument is always the best in my view,\n\nI'm going to dedicate more time to learning my guitar :)\n\njust perfect it in your 'bored time' don't make it too big in your mind like committing yourself to x amount of time everyday at 5 o'clock just integrate it into your down time, has to be something you enjoy 
12	Anybody else feel conflicted between being a thinking or feeling type?	I've watched and read a ton of ENFP type descriptions, and I kinda feel as if they're accurate, but as much as I see myself as a starry eyed dreamer, I also kinda see myself as the bold critic, always speaking my mind in defiance to norms and sensitivities. I also come off as very lacking in feeling, quick to pick fun of anything trying to appeal to emotion or draw me in. I hate the idea of not being in control of how people perceive me, or my existence being the spectacle as opposed to my personality. Now, I'm not going onto here to say I'm NOT an ENFP, as I do believe that much of the way I act is rooted in my fi and much of my thinking is efficient rather than analytical, rendering it extraverted. Also, apart from what I said right now, I can also come off as playful, energetic, perpetually smiling and trying to cheer people up, I'm just horrible at expressing feelings. I don't know if everybody can relate to this post, but I just dislike the stereotype of ENFPs being perpetually sensitive and accommodating, and I also dislike the stereotype of being naive and easily prone to emotional connection, as I'm very cautious with emotional connection. I'll always cite Bo Burnham as a cynical NFP, if that helps you understand kinda where I am. Hope this resonates, and I hope this was coherent.
5	This really made me out to be a ton more emotionless than I am. I have deeply held fi shit that is mine and that's my heart. Ok go on with your day
4	Te child. You are enfp, dont worry
3	ive been typed as  intp so i understand. The subtlety is the play between perception vs judging functions , and the extraverted vs introverted function. \n\nAs enfps, what people see is our Ne and Te at play. What makes us do things in the world (judging functions) is our Fi and Te. Fi and Te work from the information fed from our leading perception function Ne. People can NOT see our Fi as it is hidden from sight, they only see it through how we interact with Ne or with Te. \n\nGiven a high enough level of maturity of Te, you might actually be perceived as a thinking type because that is what people see but Fi is actually acting in the background with Te acting as translator.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
3	Yes, I completely relate to this. I had also saved this quote from Pinterest (no author listed) that I really related to:\n\n‚Äú...the ENFP is also that gap between the Rationals and the Idealists. Their function order NeFiTeSi means that they project a rational ‚ÄúNT‚Äù temperament to the world and NOT the so easily hurt temperament of the Idealist. Many ENFPs LOOK and ACT like NTs while maintaining an inner Idealism. Te means an ENFP can be a ruthlessly efficient machine not this procrastinator because we have ‚ÄúP‚Äù and not ‚ÄúJ.‚Äù Te gets stuff done and Si remembers what got done, remembers the past and can recall on learnt experience. \n\nSo in total the ENFP is an extremely passionate, innovative individual brimming with new ways of seeing and thinking about things. The ENFP is an Idealist who stands up for what is right and is outwardly a Rational who isn‚Äôt likely to show their emotions at all, but rather to be a high achiever, implementing strategies and getting stuff done.‚Äù
2	You just might have your Te more developed than your Fi. I get it I can be the same way. Have you done Enneagram stuff? I'm a 7w8 and thus am more assertive and Te than many ENFP's that are 7w6 or 4's etc.
1	I was strong Thinking until I did shrooms\n\n&#x200B;
14	ENFPs, do you guys like isolating yourself?	I‚Äôm an INFP. I‚Äôve been seeing an enfp girl for a while, and I noticed that she tends to isolate herself, a lot. She‚Äôs extremely passive, but sometimes she can get really into talking with me, but then at times she can just disappear and take half a day to reply to me. She seems to be more daring across text by actually flirting with me but she seems really shy in person. She will never say the things she texts in person to my face. When we go out it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm her gay best friend and not her boyfriend lol\n\nHow does this all work? It‚Äôs like she has two modes: Completely excited and into everything or completely uninterested and wants to isolate herself from the world. No middle. \n\nDo you guys feel like this? \n\nIm an INFP myself so I understand since I need alone time too, but I feel like she seems more extreme than me. How does it work lol
11	Hey this sounds like me! I‚Äôm either very high energy and flirty or wanting to be completely alone. I need the alone time to recharge üòä Also I‚Äôd say as she gets to know you more that shyness will dissipate.
9	>How does this all work? It‚Äôs like she has two modes:\n\nYes ENFPs have two modes, and all humans have at least two modes with at least one thing.\n\nWhy does this occur?  It is due to Auxillary Fi, but it also has to do with very weak and crappy Se.  *How can I explain this simply I ask myself?*\n\nENFPs like to not "harm things", they do not like to instill their will onto others if the other person does not want to be forced into dong X, so they mentally sequester themselves instead of trying to instill their will onto other people, systems, and so on.  Even when it is completely unnecessary.  *Now this is dramatically over simplistic*, but you see the ENFP is free for they recognize they can merely go to a new place in order to experience new FEELS inside of themselves and to process the existing FEELS until they are ready to reattach to the external world once again. . . But it is not really this simple due to inferior Si (skips how inferior Si is related to all of this.)\n\n(Note I love this fact about ENFPs.  I find it freaking adorable but that is just how I am built, other INTJs like it or they are annoyed by it, or some other dozens of things.)
6	aaaayup!  Before I accepted that I needed alone time I acted like that.  Now I tell people before disappearing most of the time. 
6	It's due to inferior Si. We don't maintain our energy reserves as efficiently as others and then we need to shut down past a threshold. 
5	Sounds like me lol. I do this if I really like the person. It's easier to express myself through text. In person I'm way more shy. I can also be a slow texter because I like to focus on the present, not on my phone. \n\nA nice intermediate between phone world and real life is darkness. If you can, stay up late in bed talking to her (in person) in the pitch black, or if you're not at that level, take her for a late night walk to look at the stars. When I fell in love with my gf I had a similar feeling of being crazy about her but still kind of feeling like strangers during the day when I would see her at school. The best way to get over this is to sleep over some night, stay up late, then spend the next morning/day hanging out in bed for hours. The continuity of being together between night and day helps the connection. Also if you can both really express your feelings in the dark and then wake up next to each other, that helps bridge the gap. That's what worked for me anyways!\n\n
5	I‚Äôm a chronic isolator. I love people when they‚Äôre around me, but I‚Äôd very happily stay at home before that. 
5	Recharge periods. While I love all my friends and family and will spend loads of time with them, that energy gets spent incredibly fast. When I don‚Äôt get enough alone time, I slow down and become disinterested in people. Alone time is necessary for me.
3	Yeah I definitely feel the up‚Äôs & downs part. Sometimes I‚Äôll be the life of my friend group and all about the vibe, then the next day I‚Äôll want to get away from everything and just read or play video games by myself. But when I hangout with people I‚Äôm almost always on that ‚Äúup‚Äù phase and want to be around people. I would be pretty straightforward and initiate a conversation about it. Idk about other ENFP‚Äôs on here, but I always appreciate people being honest and not beating around the bush. Just don‚Äôt be a dick about it, be sincere
3	This is totally me. My isolation time increases dramatically when I'm stressed, anxious or depressed, too. 
2	I've been extremely isolated the last few weeks, and it is entirely my own choice. (Granted, being "isolated" as an ENFP I still see my friends like once a week and go dancing, but instead of having plans almost every night it got more like one or two nights a week) \n\nI'm not in a good place right now and things feel very transformational for me, which is making me hermit a bit. I had my first (very pleasant) poly sexual experience this morning, and am in an intense fight with my ex at the same time. So I'm in my bedroom, moping and drinking wine, while we have guests in the house - ignoring them completely. \n\nSorry, this doesn't answer your question, but I'm so overwhelmed right now! I think a feeling of being overwhelmed is what makes us go hide most of all. We experience emotions very strongly, and it can be too much sometimes. 
2	Sounds accurate \n\nShe maybe nervous around you in person? how long have you guys dated?
2	I just have to write because this is how i act(enfp, f) in the beginning of the relationship. Its not like I dont like the guy, obviously I wouldnt see him if I didnt, but as soon as the relationship starts I feel so overwhelmed by the possibilities the relationship can go, I guess I freak out Especially in person. I have to go into my private space and try to understand whats going on in my emotion. If the guy I am dating becomes pushy... like buy me gifts or try to find reassurance, i immediately turn off and get a little mean even. This is so bad. I commend the last boyfriend who stuck around for all of this. Treating him like a gay best friend sounds too familiar, if shes like me, she is trying to feel out how this is going. Because Im usually very sweet and bubbly, the guy gets taken aback from this inconsistency. Anyway, your situation may be completely different. My advice is use unexpected humor to lighten things up. 
1	for me it sounds like she hasn't warmed up herself enough for you, maybe it takes longer time for her, or she is still thinking if you guys match a lot ( could only be suspicion and insecurities, not always depends on when you guys really doing  )
1	Sounds exactly like me! Yes, often find myself in isolation every once in awhile. Sometimes it is tough to snap out of 
33	is it me or its common among ENFPs (Relationship related)	Firs post, Sorry in advance for any mistake. And definitely this post is not a perfect one.\n\n\-\n\nSo basically, I as an ENFP (M) want to be in a relationship. I have noticed that a lot of girls do like me and some even start showing signs of interest but it is exactly at this moment that, I either start ignoring them a lot or just dont be that friendly to them. Is it just me or its kind of common among ENFPs? And Any idea on how can I overcome this situation? 
18	Sounds like you might have an avoidant attachment style. I'd recommend doing some reading about attachment theory. 
9	HA!  I was just trying to explain this to a dude on a second date last night.  The way it ended up coming out was something like:\n\nSo, I have enough self awareness that I LOVE all new people and am warm, friendly, and inviting when I meet anyone.  I also know that when it passes from acquaintance/friend to possibly something deeper, I pull back,m come off fairly cold and just focus on taking in information and deciding what those feelings are or how deep they go... but that always comes off like I lost all interest.  \n\nSo, I'm sorry for that, but it means I really don't know where you stand in my head and feels yet and I need to think about it, but thanks for bringing it up and talking about it rather than just assuming.
4	Maybe it‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt like them back and you don‚Äôt want to give off the wrong vibe by having them think you reciprocate their feelings so you back off for a while.\n\nOr maybe that‚Äôs just me, hmm
7	This feels like my girlfriend. She seems really excited to be around me at times but then she will take half a day to reply me and completely ignore me some times
6	As ENFPs I think we fall really quickly cause we get really excited and also fall out of infatuation really quickly too cause we get bored of things. \n\nAlso ENFPs loved being loved and hate being boring and lonely so we tend to rush into things without thinking about everything. \n\n(I'm totally generalizing here and might be projecting my own undeveloped ENFP traits hahaha)\n\nPlus you're young. People around this age are super lost and experimental so relationship and flings come and go quickly. It takes a while to really build a solid connection with someone and that's just for friendship. Its even tougher with a potential partner. \n\nYou're in your 20's. You gonna date a lot of random people. Good and bad, but all experiences are good. You're gonna learn and grow and change a lot. What I've learned so far is you can't rush the process. You gotta go on bad dates and date someone that'll cheat on you. All that ends up making you, you! So embrace whatever the Universe has in store for us with open arms :-)\n\nEdit: words
3	same fking problem here !!!
3	Ok man, you have to be careful because I have personal experience with this. Because of trapped emotions from your Fi, you could be avoiding be loved to avoid vulnerability to such emotional pain. I had problems with attracting maneaters for this reason. I had the thrill of the chase of being loved but yet still far away from it.\n\nI had to be alone for sometime, process trapped emotions over and over, learn about my gifts, learn a daily routine for mental toughness, actually finding a dream to work on, and that gave me the abilities to have success with dating by 10 times fold with no more maneaters!!!\n\n&#x200B;
3	I‚Äôm the same way. Once someone starts showing interest back in me or in me in general, I like the attention but I‚Äôm never into it. I always like when I‚Äôm curious whether they are into it or not
5	i'm a girl and this is constantly happening to me it feels like a curse and probably why i go after emotionally unavailable people.. and then they turn emotionally available and i run 
2	Bro, I feel you. I'm an ENFP and I can't believe it happens to others. \n\nMy brother is an ISTJ, and he is always talking about girls. He makes fun of me for being so 'idealistic'. \n\nI'm straight but I keep ignoring girls too. \n\nI haven't done anything right now to overcome this situation. But I think it's worsening with time. 
2	My special move is not attracting anybody, but if I do, they lose interest within a month. Yeehaw
2	If you don't mind me asking, what's your age? There is an ever so slight possibility that you just aren't ready for commitment. It may even have to do with your values and you just haven't found what you're seeking for in a girl. I'm currently seeing an ISTJ (F), I know right.... polar opposite, however, in theory, it should balance out. Maybe that's what you need, a personality which would like to settle and is very loyal. Then again you maybe just haven't met a girl who is interesting enough or extroverted, the issue is on your end, you need to figure out what you want. Using the terminology "them" does not help your case also, you need to focus on one girl whose values mirror yours. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen you talk to multiple girls who are flirting with you at once, it's superficial and will prevent you from wanting to enter a relationship or care for one girl. Just find one where:\n\n1. You have similar Interests / Values  eg. (bushwalking, loyalty etc.)\n2. You enjoy her personality and one on one time with her (conversing) (she's interesting)\n3. You find her attractive to a degree\n\nThen give her all your attention, if the feelings are mutual, voila!\n\nGood luck, you may be an ENFP but you are in control of a lot of things :)
2	I have this all the time and instead attach to my shitty ex. I think it's an avoidant attachment style weirdly disguised as an anxious attachment style, since I act anxiously attached to someone who is clearly a shitty person and has treated me horribly in the past, and I use it as a crutch to not get attached to anyone new - who might just be worth my time if I gave them the chance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBuuut that's just my two cents in my situation, maybe others can relate! 
2	Research anxious/avoidant attachment styles. There are also levels of anxiety, psychopathy, machievellianism (forgive my spelling), and narciccism (dark triad, anxiety, attachment styles). \n\nAll of those metrics can apply to all personality types in different degrees. \n\nIt sounds to me you have anxiety, or an avoidant attachment style. 
1	Maybe you‚Äôre a Sagittarius?
1	Oh well, just like who you like :) nothing so horrible about that
332	Mah hart.	
67	But... They said Hi back, that means we're getting married!
28	I inadvertently cured this with a deposit on a Bengal kitten. I‚Äôm not currently dating (working on me) but I still can be weak at times and might entertain an obvious jerk who paid attention...\n\nAfter I committed to this new kitten, I‚Äôve  learned that I am no longer weak to that. I mean if you aren‚Äôt all that, you‚Äôre not worth me losing focus on getting my house ready for my new baby. \n\n**I‚Äôm not suggesting any of you get a fur baby to fill a void but I think sometimes we just want something to get excited about and a promise of a connection. Lol**\n\nEdit: sentence structure

19	Any ENFP here having a real hard time moving on? Would love some feedback	I have noticed this problem since my early days. And now as I'm getting older I totally understand that there are things in your life that was not meant to last forever and everybody around me taught me that's just how life is. But I find myself ruminating over beautiful things that happened and why I could not salvage it at the time and if I were to have a second chance, the things I would do differently, etc. Everytime I feel this way I feel like being a dick to the current people in my life and how ungrateful I am to have them and having the time of my life and yet I kept thinking about things that does not exist and probably never will. I genuinely love where I am now, I feel like I'm very lucky to have what I have but why am I feeling like this? Or is this just one of the traits of an unhealthy ENFP?
8	I‚ÄôVE BEEN OBSESSING FOR THREE MONTHS OVER A FRIEND WHO STOPPED TALKING TO ME AND MY FRIENDS HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME CRY ABOUT IT EVERY DAY YET I AM INCAPABLE OF MOVING ON OR LETTING IT GO AND I AM ANNOYING MYSELF AS MUCH AS I AM ANNOYING MY FRIENDS HELP HELP HELP 
3	ENFPs particularly struggle to let go because they see all of the possibility in what could've been with that particular person. It sounds like you need to take time to process your emotions (see my last post in post history about crying alone) so that your Ne (extroverted intuition) can start generating excitement about the future possibilities. \n\n
3	No 100% I‚Äôm terrible at moving on, I dwell too much on what could‚Äôve been, we always see the best in things and in people, so it‚Äôs hard for us to not think ‚Äúwhat could have been‚Äù. You just gotta learn that it‚Äôs always just a possibility and not reality, and that there‚Äôs bigger, better things out there for us. Love <3
3	This is because that memory still has something to teach to you. There is something about it, that your mind is signaling that's improtant there.\n\nThe point of our memories is not to keep an objective record of the past. The point is to prevent you from getting hurt. You have not extracted the lesson which will do that.\n\nI personally used Jordan Peterson's therapeutic writing program - Past authoring - to help me with this. However any therapeutic writing assignment would help. It's so much faster and more affordable than therapy.\n\nBut to write out your memories and gain closure takes effort. However it works and is worth it. 
3	As a kid, I never really had a ton of friends and was not at all "popular" so when I entered High School I did so in a bad emotional state romantically. I've had crushes find out I like them only to scream in my face and run away haha. When I was a freshman I met this guy he was a senior at the time. He was the first guy ever to show any kind of attention in that way and I did a bad thing and held him on a pedestal, in my eyes he did absolutely nothing wrong. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter meeting him in Freshman year we went out off and on, I was basically his backup he dated me until he found someone he ACTUALLY wanted to be with. I was naive and thought well he always comes back to me it must be fate, we must be meant to be together. A lot of the time when we were together it was secret because he couldn't bear the fact that other people knew he was with me. He would be made fun of and was just really cruel and so he would never want to be with me publicly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI spent literally my whole high school life in this kind of relationship. I could not get over him even if I tried. The little bit of attention and affection he shared fueled my infatuation with him. Even after highschool, we were on and off. I always felt like "this time it will be different" and the last time we were together he seemed different more mature, he didn't care who knew and saw that we were together, I met his family he met mine. We were gonna get married and everything. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe moved away for college, and all of his stupid behavior started coming back, he wouldn't call, wouldn't talk to me, I understood he was busy but seriously didn't have 5 minutes to call me or anything. I ended up moving near him for my college because I thought well it would be better if we were near each other.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut he never made the effort he never tried to come to see me, and I was 19 in a city I knew nothing about and he didn't even care. It was then that I was like this is just ridiculous, but I wanted to be the grown up and either break up on the phone or in person. Every time I would call and leave a message to call me, he would call me crying, saying how he would change and all that shit. I am so gullible sometimes, and this kept happening over and over again finally I was just like no we're done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI saw him a couple times after that and it straight up killed me because he had a new girlfriend like not long after we were not together. A good couple years later we met up again for some idiotic reason but I am so glad we did. It was the very first time I felt NOTHING when I saw him NOTHING. I looked at him and was like what did I see in him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause I didn't know it at the time but when I moved to that city all alone at 19 I was maturing fast and becoming an adult, he went to a college with his twin brother. Nothing changed, he was the same guy I met in freshman year. It was so easy to see that he would never step outside of his comfort zone and become a better person, he cared way too much about what other people thought to even have a thought of his own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Spent the majority of my teen life in love with someone I shouldn't be, finding it absolutely impossible to get over him and live a better life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S: Friends were NOT helpful haha they were always just like "just get over him" that is the worse phrase ever, its like if I could, don't you think I would have by now?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow I am 28, been through the wringer with relationships, I have a really good guy now, but still trying to learn how to feel again haha. Being in relationships takes a lot out of you.
2	I had a break up that really wrecked me. It was one of the hardest things I've done but so necessary for my personal growth. It took me four months of crying and sadness to heal. One night, I tried mushrooms and really examined myself and where I was emotionally. I burned all the stuff of his I still had in a symbolic, if very dramatic, gesture. I felt so much better and more free. \nEven after all that though I still think about our relationship all the time. Things will remind me of him or us and I get caught up in thinking about how it could have been different or what went wrong or any number of things. The thing that is different now is that it doesn't make me sad anymore. It's more of a process. I just hope it doesn't las forever. 
2	Yeah I do the same and I used to overthink so much to the point I would get migraines. Now, I realize people are goin through shit every day. We all got family problems, financial problems, housing problems, and everything else in between. You never really know what someone is going thru. You know what they tell you but you don't know what's really going on inside their head. So realize people need space and time to deal with their shit and sometimes dealing with their shit doesn't include you. So accept that and move on. I know it's easier said than done but if you do it enough times and you talk it through your mind logcially, you'll begin to emotionally let it go. 
2	[https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2016/10/02/10-things-terrify-enfps-according-304-enfps/](https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2016/10/02/10-things-terrify-enfps-according-304-enfps/) . I think this link will help your current worry a lot. I also feel like you are feeling right now. My suggestion would be. Stop regretting and look for better opportunities atm. Plus this I think by reading many articles, is a common thing among ENFPs but im not sure if this is only for unhealthy ENFPs or for healthy ENFPs also. As I think, no matter how successful you are, you will have regrets. 
1	Yup, I feel this, I‚Äôve been trying to get over the same guy for a year and a half :/
1	This is because of the pain of disappointment that comes from life not playing out as you imagined it. This is a huge problem for ENFPs, myself included, because our Ne is our number one function, we imagine, see the big picture, and that helps to fuel us, but it will always be different than we expected.\n\nWith the pain of disappointment, it is easy to be bitter about it, and then you want to that on other people. I have been trying to accept this Ne being wrong most of the time thing, and it sucks, but it is helping me be happier.
1	Yeah I'm really terrible at letting go and have been that way since I was a kid. I get very emotionally attached to people who I come to love, both platonic & romantic. I start to love them deeply, like a family. Because of this, it usually takes me years to move on from breakups and close friendship fallouts. It's also very painful and confusing to see how it's so easy for some others to cut out their "once loved ones" from their lives so fast. I honestly feel like it's normal for humans to have a hard time letting go, if the love & the bond between them were sincere and strong. \n\nOn the other hand though, having this trait often makes people like us to be vulnerable to fall into a toxic relationship/friendship and get stuck there, unable to call it quits
9	High expectations on other people	I know that when I give something, I should not expect anything in return because I‚Äôll only get disappointed. But is it too bad to hope... that people will try to get to know me as deep as I know them?\n\nEvery person I meet, I put in effort, time and feelings to break down their walls so I know what makes them the person they are- what their fears are, what are they passionate about, what motivates them....\n\nAnd yet, no one ever tries to get to know me that way. Is it my fault? Because I only volunteer information about myself when they ask, and I don‚Äôt when they don‚Äôt ask at all... I don‚Äôt easily open myself up especially to people who I know are just asking for the sake of asking and not really genuinely concerned about me. \n\nBeing an ENFP is both a blessing and a curse sometimes. I have many friends but I think none of them has ever really broken down my walls. \n
7	Its not your fault. In the same way that we are externally focused, others are internally focused. Often we are attracted to each other (for friendships or relationships). We help them express their inner self, and they help us become grounded within ourselves. \n\nIf your friends are comfortable sharing their depth with you, then they are probably comfortable with you sharing your depth with them. The difference is they are not the kind of people to ask those questions, because they don't know what they want to know. Because they think it might be too personal. Because they are the kind of person that usually shares but doesn't ask, just like you are the kind of person that usually asks but doesn't share. \n\nStop waiting for your friends to read your mind. Next time its appropriate, ask your friend if its okay if you get a little personal and then share some stuff. Break down your own walls a bit and let others in. 
3	I once thought that all adults are wise. I was wrong. I once thought others know what they are doing and I should just shut up and learn. This worked well for me but others are just as clueless if not more, some are even oblivious. I learned how hurtful betrayals felt. Now I'm very careful of who I am willing to let in and can spot bull shit like a radar. But most of all, I learn that expectations are made to only disappoint. Things almost never go the way we want. Now I want to see people for what they really are: what they believe in and what they value.
3	Lol, it's so funny how I'm the same way and I think about this all the time too. I'm a open book if they ask but if they don't, well... they're not going to get a lot from me. Fortunately I have a couple of friends who I will just tell them how I'm feeling without them even asking because we're at a comfortable place with eachother but even then, if I feel like I'm being "too much" or a bore, then I'd isolate myself completely from everyone. I think about how it could be my fault that people don't really want to know me as deep as I know them and I've come to conclusion that it is my fault. I think that assuming they're not genuinely concerned about me because they don't ask about me is my fault. Don't get me wrong, I STILL do this, to this day but what I do now, or try to do at least, is whenever I ask them a question about them to get to know them better, I try to throw in something about myself before asking the question or relate to them after they tell me their answer. It gives them a chance to kind of ask me more questions about my response and then they're able to get to know me more too. This doesn't really work all the time but hey, it kinda gives the other person more of a chance to ask you questions and it helps you see if this person is someone you can trust.
3	I'm reluctant to share my weaknesses too until I trust the person, I wouldn't give too much away if there was a shallowness in their asking either.. so I can relate with most of this. Maybe it's the Fi ? 
7	When to push yourself, when to take it easy?	Any other ENFPs have a hard time balancing this? I tend to operate in extremes when it comes to pushing myself to work harder/more and taking it easy. Either I work myself until I‚Äôm exhausted and snapping at everyone, or I slack off and take ‚Äúsick days‚Äù from work. What is the balance you have found with this? Why do you think this imbalance comes about for us ENFPs? Is it possible that I have learned that taking care of MY self is considered slacking? (Also related-I work in a stressful job).
6	I apply finance/ econ thinking. I'm also a nerd.\nI've a reserve pool of energy ( money).\nI want more energy.\nI either get it directly through food.\nOr through feelings directly or indirectly.\n\nI get that return by investing energy in the form of action and thought processes.\n\nI strategize how to get the best return based on the above.
2	Push yourself when you feel like you need to, aka when you feel guilty about taking a sick day. Take a sick day when you feel guilty about overworking yourself. Take care of your body with a healthy diet and exercise. Take care of your mind with journaling, hot baths, fun, and self-expression. It‚Äôs all a balance
1	Yesss, idk if I‚Äôm feeling lazy or am actually physically/ emotionally exhausted. Then feel stressed from this predicament

11	Be wary, that your fantasies will create a phantom image between you and your attraction. You have a certain level of attraction to someone. And when you begin to fantasize and think about this attraction, you are creating emotions that were not there to begin with. You are manipulating the image that you see in front of you. Notice how much power your perception of the world has over you. And then stop doing it. Stop doing it because you are creating a phantom image between you and your attraction. You are creating an illusion between you and truth. You may say to yourself that you will remember, or that you know true attraction and that it doesn't matter, but that is ignorance. You still have a choice to fantasize, but you are creating inevitable suffering for yourself.\n\nIt is good to have attraction, there is something between you two that is mystrious. Let it reveal itself to you, instead of thinking that you are going to get married, or thinking that she is the ideal one, or thinking how you are attracted to her, or why. Let it remain a mystery, let the answer come to you. When the question dis pears, bring it back again, and stay with it forever. That is your love. It's the attraction, it's the mystery. So why are you so moved to kill that? To discover it? Take your time, as slowly as you can. Be with it. Enjoy it. Love it.\n\n
7	Why dis so true, so sad
5	INFJ: "I need to stop being nice to weirdos"
2	Good for you mate. Don't have too many children.
2	I feel like male Enfps do this more than females and I couldn't tell you why this seems to be the case.  
8	To show yourself, to be yourself, to what extent?	One thing I can conclude while going through this reddit every day is that most people who type ENFP tend to be a bit emotional. I am as well.\n\nWhat this means for me is that I have a enormous need for expression. Both about inanimate as animate things. In my free self (with good friends), I say whatever I feel and do whatever I want (with the exception of hurting, or hindering others too much of course). \n\nApart from this, I do however, also feel an enormous emotional pain throughout every day. For this I have been going to a therapist. What we have come to, is that this pain is a result of me not listening to my own desires/feelings so to say. It is an anger/frustration that comes up because I often hold my self back. This can be a situation where people hurt me and I don't tell, but this could also be a situation where I am really grateful/like someone for something and don't tell because I am afraid to come off weird, or to say it in common ENFP terms; 'too much'.\n\nAs I now understand it, to avoid this, I should instead of listening to my fears, follow my heart and gut more. Of course you should still always take the other into consideration, but not so far as to let your fears use it as an excuse. \n\nSo in short, I am an incredibly expressive person, but hold my self in a lot as well, resulting in a immense inner frustration. \n\nMy question is, how can I see the line between something I want, and should therefore express, or the idea that something is too much/could better me done another time. \n\nAccording to my best friend, I make my life unnecessarily hard by holding back. That by being my pure self more, I wil have an easier time finding people, but also most importantly, I will feel happier about myself.\n\nBut then with my current situation, I just don't know what is right. Do I text the girl I love that I miss her, or do I wait 1,5 weeks till she is actually back again. Texting her that I miss her, my fears tell me, would be too much since we aren't a thing yet. \n\nSo this is where the pain comes from, the endless frustration on what I can and cannot be according to myself. \n\n
7	You can be both a listener and the express yourself, to yourself. You never truly need someone else, it's always a call from within, to go within. To be within. It's a call to yourself from yourself. \nAnd this is why it feels too much, or wrong to you. It feels wrong to put those desires out them. Because there is something wrong about it, there is something deeply selfish about emotions and forcing your desires and wants on another. \n\nWe're all expressive people, and when we hold ourselves back, we create resistance in the flow of life. So things bog up in us, and those things are our emotions. The key is not to go out and express those emotions, because then you would be communicating the stuck up emotions. The key is to release the resistance, to heal yourself. When you find a way to be whole, without expecting anything from the outside world, in other words, when you accept your current situation in life, not from an emotional perspective, but from a rational-Now-perspective, life will begin to flow again, the emotions will start clearing, and once they're cleared, you will be able to communicate. You will be able to tell your beloved, not that you miss him, or that you're sad or angry about something. You will share your love, your happiness, your excitment.\n "Hey beautiful, having a great time I hope! Can't wait until you come back and tell me all about it!"\n\nAccept your situation, and accept that you feel a certain way about it. But realize, again and again, that it's not how things actually are. Just like everything changes, this too will pass. Let that be a strength to you, and so feel and be sad or whatever emotion you feel. And remember that this will soon pass. So learn all you can from it, while you can. Don't act from it. You already know the results of acting from that emotion. It feels too much, because, frankly, you emphatic creature, it IS too much(Or very likely to be perceived as such). \n\nThe next time you see a therapist, I'd say to ask him, "Please tell me, as directly, and honestly as you can, How can I be happy in life again?" "How can I be happy without needing anyone or anything else in life, **right now**?" Because if you manage to do the second question, then you will always have a partner. Because people are dying for someone that is not needy, someone that will listen to them, that will be there, without demanding anything in return. \n\nAll the love, good luck.
1	Yeah man, I found I cannot be myself too much at work  because I do not trust people too much. I really don‚Äôt care what they think of me but I hate it when my thoughts and expressions are criticized. Like they feel they can patronize me and what not, and I can‚Äôt chew them out or start drama. Not anymore anyways.\nAs far as the woman texting thing, I always went by the rule of no response until she responds, that has helped me be successful with dating a few times over
153	Does anyone else love being social, but need to be completely alone to process emotions ?	If I'm not completely alone I don't feel safe. I'm a dude and not comfortable enough to cry in front of friends or most people yet. I've only cried in front of my ex and one other girl. \n\nI've realized that I do NEED my emotional process time though. I've gotta chill out for at least an hour or more each day to just feel my emotions and let things come out. \n\nIf I don't I feel numb, low energy, get headaches and other psychosomatic symptoms. \n \nI'm a type 7 enfp though, emotional expression wasn't the best in my family which was super logical. And I was bullied for feeling sad. So it's hard for me to feel and release, but I love when I'm in touch with my emotions even when they're sad emotions because it's so deep and authentic. 
38	Definitely, not only to process emotions but to reflect, learn lessons, and grow too. I absorb a lot of stuff when I'm with other people, but I don't really think about things and internalize them until I'm alone. If I don't get this alone time then I stall in my progress/development, I lose focus and become distracted, and become anxious.  
16	Yes this is the nature of Fi valued and Fe subdued.  (So _ _ FP and _ _ TJs) but it is even more so the nature of Fi being in the auxiliary or tertiary slot, the "arms" slots / the "producing" slots (so I am refering to E_FPs and I_TJs.)\n\nBorrows some other person's words to help make my point.  She is a ENFP and if I recall correctly a type 7 (do not quote me on the type 7 bit though.)\n\n>https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/12/how-each-cognitive-function-manifests-based-on-its-position-in-your-stacking/\n\n>**I_FPs who have Dominant Introverted Feeling:**\n\n>* As a dominant function, Fi manifests as a moral compass that points its user toward the direction they ought to explore next, based on how they feel about the information at hand.\n\n>* The dominant-Fi monologue:‚ÄúI must decide how I feel and where I stand on these issues before coming to a conclusion about what to do.‚Äù\n\n>#E_FPs who have Auxiliary Introverted Feeling:\n\n>* As an auxiliary function, Fi manifests as a method of reflecting on and assessing how the user feels about his or her past actions.\n\n>* The auxiliary-Fi monologue: ‚ÄúI need to isolate myself to process how I feel about the activities I‚Äôve been engaging in lately and decide whether or not to keep doing them.‚Äù\n\n>**I_TJs who have Tertiary Introverted Feeling:**\n\n>* As a tertiary function, Fi manifests as strong, unwavering set of morals and values which the user draws upon to dictate many of their major decisions.\n\n>* The tertiary Fi monologue: ‚ÄúI must adhere to my values and morals at all costs ‚Äì even if doing so is unpleasant.‚Äù\n\n>**E_TJs who have Inferior Introverted Feeling:**\n\n>* As an inferior function, Fi manifests as a general disdain for emotional expression and a fear of being perceived as ‚Äòweak‚Äô by others.\n\n>* As Fi matures, its user will begin to identify the role their own personal morals play in their lives, and allow those morals to take on a greater role in their decision-making process.\n\n>* The inferior-Fi monologue (prior to maturation): ‚ÄúFeelings are for the weak. I have no time to attend to such trivial matters in either myself or others.‚Äù\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>I'm a type 7 enfp though, emotional expression wasn't the best in my family which was super logical. And I was bullied for feeling sad. So it's hard for me to feel and release, but I love when I'm in touch with my emotions even when they're sad emotions because it's so deep and authentic.\n\nSo with my crappy childhood I am sometimes like this character with stripes (even though she is an ISTJ, but that is besides the point.)  Watch 50 seconds please.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3P38sY_Lfs&feature=youtu.be&t=98\n\n>but I love when I'm in touch with my emotions even when they're sad emotions because it's so deep and authentic.\n\nYes it is the best (to touch the emotions and recongize them and to call the emotions out by their name), but also the best is to let the emotions flow like a river, and stand in the river and feel the flow, and be changed by the flow and you find peace and joy in this movement of the river, this movement of the emotions.\n\nFeels the urge to post 10 more videos from the series I just linked.
13	Yes, this is exactly how I am as well. It is Fi, it means hidden, intense, complicated feelings as well as the decision making judgments of authenticity.  I use journal time, I do some affirmations, and I cry when I need to but when I am alone. I had experiences with people judging me when I did show tears and it is just so odd to me how people think that emotional processing is weakness because it is the complete opposite of that. \n\nIt is weak to numb feelings and play with distractions all day. 
7	Hey! Infp here. I get you. The other day I broke down crying at a small party, seems like I can only cry when I'm drunk, it was so embarassing. I got in trouble for expressing emotions when I was little so I find it hard be vulnerable Infront of others. Also Fi needs to process emotions on their own, internally. Fe users need to express their emotions, kinda like how Te users think more in action and by talking.
5	Oh man, I completely get this as a fellow ENFP. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince I've moved in with my partner, I've felt like I've been unable to find time to be completely alone. I've become that anxious, distracted person - and am really unable to react emotionally at the moment because I haven't given time to sift my thoughts through my values.  This is causing a bit of grief to both of us since before when I was living alone I was a much more centered person. Now I feel really unsure of myself all the time. \n\nHe's also a hardcore introvert and we live in a  small apartment/large city, I find it difficult to get away and have my own private space or claim space within our apartment to myself.  I know it's the right thing to do but I can't seem to distinctly separate us or find room for "me". \n\n&#x200B;\n\n If anyone has suggestions on this, please let me know!  
4	Yes this is due to introverted feeling. Emotions are very deep and internal for ENFP‚Äôs. We don‚Äôt like to share them, or it‚Äôs uncomfortable for us to. When we share emotions to others, we tend to do it in a very factual manner by using our Te (extroverted thinking). 
3	Yep it‚Äôs the same for me. I like socializing with friends but I need my alone time afterwards or I‚Äôll start feeling drained and tired, even sick sometimes. But the same goes for me when I‚Äôve been alone for too long. I get really depressed and tired of my thoughts when I don‚Äôt get to socialize for a long amount of time.
3	Yes! I think this is one of the defining characteristics of an ENFP
3	its like I get so swept up in the other person, I cant think about crap
2	Yep
2	I feel like this is the common thread that binds us ENFPs (or is it ENFPers?)
2	Yeah we are the most introverted extroverts. The ENFP stereotype is bubble and crazy and random. But that's only like 30% of the time. We really need our alone time to process and learn new things.
2	In our modern day society, crying is one of the inevitable taboos. We don't know what to do when a person is crying, because we feel like we have to do something about it. So it is discouraged. As an ENFP I can sense that it will be harsh for others to witness this side of me. Yet I don't mind it, I put myself over others because of this, in a detached manner. I will cry if I feel like I need to, and I will give myself my own, detaching from the other world if needed.\n\nThe real downside not to let yourself express and process your emotions in a social environment is the repressing element. You will get used to doing this and it will make things harder with a partner, and even with yourself! \n\nI suggest a practice to you, sit in front of a mirror, and just gaze at one of your eyes(pick one and stick with it). Gaze until it hurts and you start crying, without blinking. If you blink then open your eye. After a while close your eyes. And continue doing this. You will process your emotions faster, and you will develop self love and lose any repression that you may have. A good mantra "I let go, in body and mind", as you release tension in your body(again and again).
1	....Type 7?
27	Do any other ENFPs have atrocious sarcasm meters?	Unless it‚Äôs REALLY obvious and exaggerated sarcasm, I have a hard time telling if someone‚Äôs being sarcastic. Someone could say something like, ‚ÄúOh, yeah, I met Neil Armstrong when I was 5‚Äù and everyone would know it was sarcasm. Except me. I would completely accept it as an absolute possibility.
9	As an ENTP I can confirm that I have the same reaction funny enough I use a ton of sarcasm myself 
7	This is actually something that I‚Äôve thought a lot about recently since sarcasm often creates a rift in communication and understanding with certain people in my life.\n\nI have a lot of issues picking up on subtle sarcasm & issues with people who constantly use sarcasm since I can‚Äôt ever tell when they‚Äôre being serious or not. Unless it‚Äôs used in a dramatic tone or the content itself is something extremely outlandish, I‚Äôm not going to understand until I pick up on non-sarcastic cues following it. Usually it ends in me saying‚Äô ‚ÄúOoooh, you were joking. Okay, I get it now.‚Äù. It often leads people to think I‚Äôm naive, stupid and/or don‚Äôt have a sense of humor, all of which are not true. \n\nI don‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs related to my personality though, more so with some aspects of my upbringing. 
5	I like irony and dislike sarcasm. If someone is using sarcasm then I assume they mean it deep down.
4	All the time.   And then you become hyper conscious the rest of the time of interpersonal interactions after it's revealed.  
4	It's weird. As a kid I was the god of sarcasm and wondered why my parents didn't get it. Now I use it less and have a harder time differentiating, just like you. I don't get it when I dont expect it. As you said: it could be true and you don't want to judge somebody prematurely, even if it just is to display your open-mindedness.
4	What? Me sarcastic? Never. 
4	Never had trouble but I am usually the most snarky one in the group. 
2	 Y E S 
2	Not really, most people I know know how to convey a sarcastic joke, by having a big smile while they are saying it, making it obvious its sarcasm with the tone and what not. The times I have been confused its usually because the other person was not really signaling it was sarcasm or was out of context, hahaha in other words they didn't know how to properly be sarcastic.
2	I don‚Äôt have problems detecting sarcasm but I‚Äôm atrocious at doing the sarcasm. It sucks because I love sarcasm but only like 1% of the human population actually understand when I‚Äôm being sarcastic. 
45	Getting over someone	I just realized I've gotten so much better at this, and I had a dialogue with my self and I reached these conclusions:\n\nThe reason why its hard is because I had so many ideas and plans and scenarios in my mind of what I wanted with this person, and I feel frustrated that because of reasons that are out of my control I was never able to get those imaginations to materialize, and if I was just given another opportunity I could have done better to make them happen. But by accepting that those things were only happening in my head and just weren't real, and by categorizing them in the same realm of all the other weird impossible scenarios Im always imagining, I can look at them more coldly and realistically, see them for what they were and what they are now, truly impossible imaginations. \n\nAnd learn to accept the reality, get out of my head, store the good memories in the place I go when I need to be uplifted, but not let my self live in them, yeah go ahead cry about them, get it out of your system, you okay now? okay, accept they are now gone and be thankful for them. And store the bad ones in lessons not to be forgotten. \n\nAnd now lets go!, lets keep working on myself, I have all these free time now that I can use for a new and exciting project! Now lets use my free imagination head space to help it become real!\n\nSo this is how Ive been dealing with getting over someone, wanna hear your thoughts, hope it helps.\n\nhope you guys have a wonderful day!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
10	Thanks for sharing.  I relate to this a lot. My last break up, my inner child just wanted to to grab the asshole, shake him, and be like BUT ALL THE ADVENTURES YOU'RE THROWING AWAY just because I challenge you too much... COME ON.  
9	i felt like i ghost typed this. so me! the reason why i keep getting hung up over exes or people i will never have a chance with is because i keep idealising/romanticising them and i psycho myself into thinking i actually have feelings for them. \n\nalso, admire your drive. all the best <3
4	Thank you for sharing this! I can relate to almost everything you said! I have this huge crush on a guy. I‚Äôve had a lot of ideations on what could happen if we were together. All the adventures, or all the movies or series we could watch, all that stuff.. but a few weeks ago, I found out he‚Äôs seeing someone and that just crushed my hope that there could be an us. It helped for me to force myself to accept the truth. Iam still in the process of moving on (we‚Äôre good friends, so I can‚Äôt just cut him off and move on) it helps channeling my energy and focusing on something else more productive and meaningful for myself.
4	Hey! I'm an infp. I admire your attitude, I try to tell myself similar things. I resenate with what you said about possiblities, I often find myself court up in my ideals. Recently I've been feeling like deep down inside me there's something urking me saying I could never love again. Between FiNe dreaminess and Fi-Si loops it can be pretty tough moving on even when I no longer have any feelings for my ex. Kinda reminds me of when I hear people talking about species of animals that mate for life, if their mate dies that's the end of their love life, maybe I'm one of those species. I've heard that Delta are the most "fairy tale" like of the quadrants. I think it's important to be open and take risk when it comes to people and relationships, because if you stay in your bubble you may never find your "prince or princess", even if your bubbles is filled with dreams and possibilities and all the hope in the world. We must learn be strong and confident enough to live our lives the way we want, grow and leave the past behind us. Even if that means getting hurt, sometimes getting hurt is a healthy part of life.
5	yes, this fits exactly into the formula I use when it comes to processing emotions. So what you described fell under 2 and 3.\n\n1. Love failed to be given\n2. Love you can no longer give\n3. accepting the way things are and the ways things happened
2	Thank you, this is, really helpful.
2	I feel this completely! My last break up was unbelievably hard. I went into a shadow self (I was already in my shadow from other life events) and so after we broke up I went into a loop of how things could've gone better, attacking myself, etc forever but recently I decided to just get over her. \n\nPart of what helped was reading the enfp survival guide which I actually found to be quite accurate. It also has a section on relationships and break ups which stunned me for how accurate it was.. it made me realize that ice gotta let go, instead of turning my extroverted intuition inward and thinking of everything that could've been. 
2	YES! This is it exactly!! As a songwriter too I reeeeeeallllly tend to live in the what-ifs, and thank god I at least have somewhat of an outlet for them, but woooweeeee does it get rough. I mean, I have a knack for constantly seeing the best qualities in literally everyone I meet, which is usually good, but it gets to be an issue when you gotta deal with a toxic person who treats you like shit and still you're over in the corner thinking about all of the pOteNtiAL !! that's going !! unused!! and they could be soOoOo imPacTFUL with their gORgEOus brAIn and TaLenTs  and We could be so GreAT TOGETHER !!! if oNLy !!! Nothing throws a worse wrench in the healing process than this, seriously. I like your point of view. It's ok that I still recognize the good in people who've done a lot of bad, and it's a good quality to carry through most of my life, but it's SO important to understand that recognizing and accepting the bad and de-emphasizing the good doesn't make you a bad person when you need to move the hell on and continue to spread joy where it's actually wanted!!! I hope I can get better at this this year.
1	yes my fellow ENFP, explain things! I love to explain stuff all the time. 
14	Do dominant personalities try to control and manipulate you?	Do dominant personalities try to control and manipulate you?\n\nI think people tend to think I‚Äôm childlike, naive, and absent minded. I notice there have been men (and women) who tried to take advantage of me and control/manipulate me? Little do they know but I can see what they are doing. Then when I act serious, assert myself, and bring out my masculinity to protect myself, they are surprised and back down or they don‚Äôt like that and try to continue their aggressive\nBehavior. \n\nI feel really burnt out from being mistreated that I often act tough and masculine to keep people away especially toxic people. Ugh, anyone else relate?\n\n\nAnyone else relate?\n\nThanks.\n
8	Yep, there is one guy in my group of friend who is harassing me since some time, at first I thought it was just being playful and without the intention of hurting me but I noticed he would come back more and more and having a really bad attitude toward me as time goes. One day as we were leaving my friend's house he decided to talk about what I was saying the other day about the that fact that I decided not to eat meat anymore, but he played my character with a childish attitude and made me look like a young and na√Øve innocent boy, saying my words with a little voice ect that's when I was 100% sure that douche had a problem with me. I didn't let him finish as I was very angry and told him that I would eat his dog and he would see then if i'm a vegetarian. Hard but effective, I don't ever heard of him since. But my group friend will surely propose something near in the future, I don't know if I will go. I hate knowing that there is conflict somewhere, and if it's toward me I'd rather not go, so I don't know how it will goes from now. At least i'm free of that toxic guy. (Idk if my english is good enough to tell stories, I hope it's understanding)
6	Yup! I remember I shocked some of my friends when they found out they could not play the ego stomping game with me anymore. oh man they were so upset I started laying down boundaries, but I did not go through hell and back multiple times to let people walk over me!!
4	Yeah, but joke‚Äôs on them. I can hardly resist turning it into some type of cat and mouse situation, just for entertainment. If you see that their perception of you is erroneous, you can leverage that against them to beat them at their own game. 
2	Yes, except the part on calling on masculinity. I tend to think of it as calling on authority. I've practiced talking and thinking in a more authoritative manner and learning to trust myself more in that. The book _the Power of Presence_ helped me a lot. \nI also actively try to make only promises I can keep and follow through on what I say. That was a problem in my life for a while that led people to treat me with less respect. 
2	Yes. But you probably do the same to others. It's a natural balance that are established. 
1	Yes, but I'm gullible and will fall for it for a bit before picking up on it. 
1	i love it. we are extremely adept at sensing the motivations of others. it‚Äôs super tough to take advantage of me at my old age of 35 and I constantly call people out on their shit. 
1	I wouldn't hardly give them the title of being a dominant personality type, more so manipulative and mean spirited to try to do that if you're being a nice non-confrontational kind of guy.\n\nI would say most people aren't just mean like that, but the ones that are in my experience were in some kind of authority position teacher, supervisor etc. and if they didn't like me they used my dislikes to their advantage if they could.. so yeah being manipulative..\n\n I think if there isn't a personal factor involved for their treating you this way, then they are just that way (to accommodate their ego or something) and do that to anyone they can. Because we as enfp's naturally want to do our own thing and not be obligated to strict commitments or routines ex.. maybe they see that and don't like that bc they want to keep control.\n\nI'm a female, so I typically just get out of the situation if I can where I'm not on their radar. If I have to be around them I can get rigidly stubborn and insubordinate in the nicest possible way :P  My teacher and I once passively aggressively cussed each other out in a calm exchange when I was in 10th grade in front of the whole class.. when he wrote me up I refused to sign it. That wasn't right of me looking back, \n\n....he started it XD \n\nTip\*  Try your best to keep your calm and just get away from them\n\n&#x200B;
1	Yes!
0	They try to do anything because you are unconsciously giving it way. Some part of you likes that, and wants that and needs that, in order to grow. We always attract exactly the right people into our lives, it's never someone else's fault, it's always us seeking something. \n\nIt's not why are we attracting manipulative people, because no one is 100% like that. Why are we attraction and encouraging manipulative actions or dominating actions? \nWhat is a dominating action? It is an action that is decided and followed through, with or without the other person's approval. The middle ground, is honest action, an action that is decided rationally and taken after your partner's approval.\nWhat is manipulative action? It is an action designed to change the will of someone else to accommodate your own selfish desires.\n\nSo why do these manipulative sides are given lee-way? Why do you want people to manipulate you? Maybe you want to see if you can endure? Maybe you want to see how much power someone has over you? If he succeeds in doing so? What if a person is so dominating and manipulating, that it no longer seems like that, but instead it is just assertive and powerful(Filling you with respect instead of feeling dominated), or is just charming and smooth, making you feel attractive and attracted?
0	ENFP guy (maybe likes me idk) how do i make him jealous? i know he keeps mention comments like oh you‚Äôve probably had many boyfriends in the past etc. if i post a picture with a guy friend of mine, will he take more initiative to fight for my attention, back down, ow get hurt?	
16	By don‚Äôt you. Oh. I know this is gonna sound crazy. Just fucking tell him how you feel. Be honest? Why do people gotta play these stupid fucking games. 
10	Play stupid games and you are going to win stupid prices.
7	This is a very rude thing to do. I recommend not doing it at all. 
6	Depends on the picture, odds are, he'll probably back off if he likes you. Feuding for a taken girl is pretty un-ENFP behavior. If he thinks or knows its just a friend, it won't have a significant effect. This also assumes that he checks your social media enough to notice. And I think it goes without saying that this is a rather uncool thing to do. If your goal is to drive this person off, then I'd say your plan is pretty good.
3	If there is something Enfps *hate* it's contrived drama or inauthenticity.  Your approach is completely wrong.  Just spend enough time with him and he will eventually make a move.  No need to play games.
2	I'd back down if I were him. The thing I hate most is thinking I need to convince someone to spend time with me or choose me over others. Literally the worst.
1	*Flashes-back*, in my memory, to an event that lasted several months, that occurred 13 years ago.  *Does not share the event*, for it is a private story between 3 people.  It is private for the story ended in a great result for 2 of the people but it caused much pain and reconciliation, and yadda, yadda, yadda.
1	If he is really into you, yeah it may work, I know Ive gotten pretty anxious and started overthinking a lot when I girl posted pics with other boys, but this only worked when we had already dated a bit and shared feelings of liking one another, but I wasnt sure of her intentions. in the end I ended up backing out, cause I hated the hot and cold shit, it made me feel insecure, and when I realized that I didnt want to be with someone that made me feel that way.\n\nNow if he isnt completely falling for you, it wont work he is just gonna back off.\n\nJust be honest, tell him your feelings, Ive said this many times, with ENFPs you really can just do it, even if we dont feel the same way, it wont be awkward, if we care about you we will keep you in our lives, and if we know your feelings we may start seeing you in a new light, and hey, maybe develop feelings and decide to give it a try!\n\nif you feel like posting pics with a friend of yours just do it! but not with the intention of making others jealous, thats not healthy.
1	I don‚Äôt think this is the best strategy to get an enfp. He may play for a little bit but might shut you out if he finds your not being authentic
1	Acting in this way (and to be honest even considering it a possibility) betrays an insecurity in you from my perspective. Plus, games like this only beget more games directed back at you, whether that be from him or someone else. Do you really want to be caught up in playing these jeolousy provoking games with people? Wouldn't you like a more authentic and sincere relationship/friendship?
4	Finding Solitude in a Relationship	Since I've moved in with my partner, I've felt like I've been unable to find time to be completely alone. I've become that anxious, distracted person - My partner last tested as an INTJ/P, so he is extremely sharp and witty whereas my reactions tend to be slow and filled with feelings. I am unable to react emotionally in the moment because I haven't given time to sift my thoughts and feelings through my values, and additionally not having time to process these things have made me feel emotionally congested. This is causing a bit of grief to both of us since before, when I was living alone, I was a much more centered person. Now I feel really unsure of myself all the time.\n\nAs an INTJ/P, he's a hardcore introvert and we live in a small apartment/large city, I find it difficult to get away and have my own private space or claim time within our apartment to myself. I know it's the right thing to do but I can't seem to distinctly separate us or find room for "me".\n\nIf anyone has suggestions on this, please let me know!
5	talk to him and let him know how you feel, he probably needs time of his own even more than you do since he is an introvert
4	Nothing is worse than feeling all on your own, nothing is worse with having company and still feeling "lonely" in such a space.\n\nTalk to him about this and be willing to be systematic and trial and error till you escape this ***unbearable*** state.  Find what works for you, and do not be ashamed with finding what works for you.\n\nJust because you like / love your partner you owe this to yourself and your relationship.
3	Well first of all INTJ and INTP are very different and have none of the same functions.\n\nBut that's not important here. You need to set bundaries and make alone time for yourself. Just because you might both be home doesn't mean you have to hang out together for example. And Maybe suggest they go out with friends more or try to get them involved in a hobby or something outside of the house so you can be alone more. Or a hobby which will engross him so much you can do your own thing. But the key thing is to talk to him and tell him all this, that you need alone time to process more. As an introvert he should be able to understand this.
2	Like I said on the other post try get a larger apartment where you can each be in different rooms
2	I like the common room in my building, coffee shops, taking a walk to the grocery store or a friend‚Äôs to clear my head, working from home occasionally when he goes into the office.
3	The Telltale Text	I hate sending a text to someone I like.  Time seems to slow down and the method of my contacting them (either phone or computer) becomes this gleaming monolith of dread.  The more I try to meditate on not worrying or thinking about it, the more I catch myself inadvertently thinking about it so the stakes unwittingly raise.  \n\nIt puts too much stress onto what I hear is such a casual first part of a relationship.  A lot of people believing ghosting isn't ghosting until the third date.  Meanwhile, if I get ghosted from this first message in a bottle, I stand at the shore despite myself looking at the waves and waiting.  Because I think as an ENFP we are prone to be optimistic fantasizers who want to believe what they imagine.  And messages in bottles are romantic, so is mail and so texts should be too.  But they're not.  They're dreadful.  
2	Fuck, this true, "gleaming monolith of dread", its awful how my phone is no longer my phone but this thing I hate to pick up, in fear that she still hasnt answered back.
2	It‚Äôs the worst!!!! Sometimes I actually have to turn off notifications and only allow myself to check at certain intervals. And then stay busy AF reminding myself that I‚Äôm a boss-ass B and how great my life is with or without that other person.
1	uffffff relate so hard.
1	Ughhhhhhh relating hard over here tooo
268	DAE feel like a complete sociopath when you arrive at this state of reflection too?	
54	Yeah I laugh as a coping mechanism so when I talk about what I went through I smile/laugh and sometimes even downplay what happened 
26	To me, it's more like I acknowledged that I'm gone through some bad things but I'm not still actively still suffering from it.
21	Ha, anytime anyone asks me why I hate my mother.
17	The more traumatic something was, the more flippant I tend to be when I talk about it. I don't feel like a sociopath, but I can see how others might see it that way. \n\n*"You can tell them anything if you just make it funny, make it rhyme..."*
9	No.... but it took a FUCK TON of therapy to not feel that hahahaha\n\nI look at it as a privileged now.  I was forced to face my shit because it was so bad.  Most people can make it through life without ever really facing themselves. 
3	I notice myself doing this. Like, my suicide attempt was only 3 years ago but feels like a lifetime ago and I talk about it so flippantly that people seem put out. I always have to say that I'm probably not going to try it again, so chill out. 
3	Yup, it makes it even worse when you say it with a smile. Then they all look at you like you are a monster....
3	My therapist literally cried at my first session with her, & I‚Äôm like chill out lady, it‚Äôs not even that bad! (& it‚Äôs not!)
1	YES. 
1	100% me
1	My grandmother hated me. I was the only grandchild born out of wedlock. I was a bastard. She used to put cigarettes out on me. Ive told a few people and their reactions i guess are to be expected but im just like ‚Äúyeah...she was a cow‚Äù 
1	INFP here, oddly enough, can confirm it
1	I used to do this when telling people my dad died. It was a way of not having to cry. But people thought it was really really weird so now I just don't talk about it anymore and that's actually not a solution 
1	Yeah. I can tell someone I fixed myself a painkillers-caffeine-alcohol coctail when I was 15 and be totally cool about it, even find the story quite funny
92	INTJs are the best/worst	
15	The last block of image , i know that INTJ might be giggling in mind from 1st to 4th  but then there is no 5th block which will be the INTJ hugging the ENFP & removing the suicide shit out of her/his mind \[lol though i see the point of empathy\]\n\n 
8	Not true, I take people with suicidal tendencies seriously. Rip the damn suicide note, give em a good scolding and try to help fix their problems. \n\nHmm, I don‚Äôt know if this is a worse idea. None of my friends has gone and done it though. So maybe it‚Äôs effective. Lol.
9	A funny story between me and a friend (who I think is more an INTP) - we were driving, and I spot a Tesla on the road. I wistfully say to myself, "someday I'll be able to afford one of those..." \n\nI'd been stuck in a physically and emotionally taxing job making 12 bucks an hour, he was a host at a restaurant, and finances had been a topic of more than a few conversations. \n\nHe responds, "you will." \n\nI get all warm and tingly inside. I'm so touched by his faith in me that someday I'll be more financially successful in my career development. I'm looking out the passenger-side window and just grinning.\n\n"... Tesla plans on making them more affordable and cost-effective for average consumers."\n\nI simultaneously laugh and die a little on the inside. \n\nHahaha, but seriously, if that's not the most accurate portrayal of our beings - the dreamy, emotional one and the pragmatic logician. He didn't even realize what he said had been misinterpreted until I explained why I was laughing! 
6	I love that the top post of this are INTJs making to the point corrections to this comic. They are special biscuits. <3
3	But which one is supposed to be the INTJ and the ENFP?
2	Got any more of them?
2	Ladies: How To Tell A Guy‚Äôs True Intentions	
6	I actually watched the whole thing. You brought up some solid points but I believe it does not actually address the main points women are concerned about. You basically set a filter over a filter over a filter, and believe this will leave you with the guys with "good" intentions.\n\nWhat women are concerned about though is not who the guy is, but will is he serious with HER (what's the difference between an asshole and an asshole that actually likes me?). Women like to pursue assholes and hope to change them, not noticing they do, and this will mostly fail. SOME work out though and this is the scenario they hope for. This is at least where I would see the issue.
10	Walking while listening to my jams	So yeah, ever since I can remember every time I'm walking or commuting anywhere alone I put on my headphones, do you do the same?\nBut recently the thought came to my mind, if this is something good for us enfps, I mean, maybe if I wasn't on my music, I would seem more approachable, or I would be more observant and notice when there may be an opportunity to interact with someone, because of our extrovert nature, do you think it would be better to stop listening to music all the time, or do you think nah? üòÉ 
4	Maybe you can try it once and see how it is for you hahaha
4	one headphone in an ear, the other free.  That's how you telegraph: 'i'm interested if it's interesting'
3	whenever i‚Äôm walking/commuting i always have my earphones in, i can‚Äôt stand pockets of time doing nothing but staring into blank space. music gives me something to focus on, especially if i like what i‚Äôm listening to. but you‚Äôre right, whenever i‚Äôm around people i hate being on my phone. i‚Äôd rather talk than the awkward silence, but this could be because my parents taught me that it‚Äôs rude to be on your phone 24/7 when people are around you. 
2	I can relate though because I dont like being on my phone when I'm around people unless they are all on theirs and ignoring me lol. I prefer the interaction with them.
2	I literally listen to music almost every hour of the day. When ever I'm walking somewhere I definitely have my ear buds in.
2	Nah, I need my quiet time. Often I've had a crap day at work and just want to listen to some screamy punk music, not talk to randos on the bus. 
2	All in all I tend to always wear earphones when I'm outside alone, unless I'm on my bike since that wouldn't be safe in traffic. I feel like it keeps some creeps away at least! And in the end, people will still stop me to ask for directions or what time it is or literally anything else, since the earphones aren't as obvious as headphones. :')
1	I never did and I never do. Mostly because I think of earbuds or whatever as a way of drowning out the external stimulus. And if I‚Äôm walking around drowning out external stimulus, there‚Äôs a good chance I get run over by a bus.\n\nOr, even worse? Miss out on an awesome conversation and possible adventure with someone sitting next to me. 
1	I used to do this, but man...you gotta hear the hidden chorus of the world! Listen and absorb the sounds around you. Even the busy city, albeit most sounds are regarded as noise, learn to hear the individual channels in the cacophony.   \n\n\nCheck out this TED talk:  \n\n\n[https://www.ted.com/talks/julian\_treasure\_5\_ways\_to\_listen\_better?utm\_campaign=tedspread&utm\_medium=referral&utm\_source=tedcomshare](https://www.ted.com/talks/julian_treasure_5_ways_to_listen_better?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare)\n\n  
6	Ignoring	Fellow INFJ here. \nI want to ask other ENFPs. Do you tend to ignore your past people completely? Like they're ghost to you?
10	For me it depends! If I cut them off, they‚Äôre dead and may well be 6 feet under. If we drifted apart over the years I‚Äôm always happy to talk but won‚Äôt seek it out with them. I have a lot of friendships that aren‚Äôt constantly maintained but when we catch we CATCH UP.
3	Interesting question. There have been several times in my life where I've had to let important people go--including my best friend and one other extremely close person. When these incidents happened, it wasn't because I didn't care about those people or because I stopped loving them. It was simply because they in some way had a negative effect on me and stopped me from progressing in life. I've often contemplated trying to reconnect with those people and even have put guilt on myself for not doing so. I guess I felt like I was somehow being selfish when in reality I was just trying to protect myself. \nIn other words, while I may not contact a person for various reasons, I never forget them, nor stop thinking about them. 
2	No.
2	From my past experiences, I realize that connections should last forever but sometimes it's best for two parties to move on. The fact that a connection is not existing does not equate to their disdain for you. In fact, I had to cut off ties with a lot of women in the past because I realized that selflessly, they won't grow from the experiences I can provide and selfishly, I won't grow from the experiences they can provide. This doesn't change the fact that I still deeply care for them and I want to wish them the best in their life, regardless if things ended poorly or not. This is why I don't ever want to forget about anyone in my past. They all mean something dear to me and I hope that I left them good memories and happiness when they reflect back into their past.
2	ENFP(M). Depends on the why they are past people. If I hurt them by ending a relationship or something, I am going to give them all the space, out of respect and maybe a lot of guilt.
2	^(*I am not an ENFP üôÇ, remember that. üôÉ* )\n\nBut to an ENFP this is a false dichotomy, a false artificial distinction created by the nature of language and how language does not accurately describe the mind.  (Aka black and white thinking.)\n\nENFPs **ignore** their past people, ***until they don't***, there is also an **observing** nature as well, and the observing is in **conjunction** / **tied together** with the ignoring even though we may via language say ignoring is the opposite / antonym of observing.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt never goes away to an ENFP, any trigger can remind the ENFP and then they observe the past person as a present person even if they can't see that past person with their eyes, there is still a bond, a web of connection.\n\nI like the term **present** vs **absent** to explain this dichotomy.  Those word choices are important in philosophy on how something can be salient now in the present, and suddenly not salient as if it absent (like a ghost) but snap your fingers and change how you view something with your point of view and suddenly the formerly absent thing is very present / salient in your mind again.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd the nature of EN_Ps is they love their point of view shifts with their god damn frustrating and super lovable Ne.  üíñüíû\n\n&nbsp;\n\n^(*üôÉ A reminder I am not an ENFP, I am just trying to share my learned experience with lots of EN_P life experiences, me trying to process them on my own understanding plus knowledge, and me also learning some theory of what other people think the foreign / alien EN_Ps are like, what drives the beautiful artifice and the beautiful soul that is them. üôÇ*)
2	Not deliberately, and for the most part not at all; I try to keep the peace as much as possible and I usually still have genuine positive feelings towards these people at least a bit and so that's what I'll channel in their direction, even if it's not perhaps as overt as it might've been. I sorta have to force myself to ignore toxic exes and the like, actually. It's like a really stressful will power exercise that usually ends in me looking their way all sad and getting another song out of it:/ artist's curse I guess lol
1	It's sometimes frightening to meet the people we share past with, because we've changed so much since then, and we're afraid to be judged about it. Or maybe we're afraid that we've outgrown them, so it will be harder for you to relate to them, or worse you'll have to pretend.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that there is a good reason you were friends once, even if you don't know it. Trust that this person is and will be still your friend, even if your differences have grown, agree to try to overcome those differences in the small interaction that you have with them. And don't expect things to go either way, just be there, loyal and sweet as you've always been. 
1	No I don't - in fact I like keeping in touch with people...I never know when I might need them again or we reconnect. Life is long. I've only ever cut off one person and it's because she made me so angry it makes me uncomfortable to talk to her again. I tried talking to her about it but it just took too much work for me to get through to her why I was hurt. She was much younger than me so I just decided to give up and the hurt still lingers every time I see her photo. That's why I avoid her.
31	Do people find you ditzy and childlike?	26 year old female over here. All my life people have underestimated me and think I am ditzy, an airhead, and childlike because I am scatterbrained and out of it. Often I think men like me more because I come across like this. They will say,‚Äùyou‚Äôre so cute!‚Äù \nPeople also say I am weird, quirky and awkward. I also tend to express my exaggerated emotions on my face which can appear childlike. When I get excited it can be exaggerated. People will often say I seem like I am in my own little world. I noticed I liked being around 3-4 year olds when I was in child care because I noticed my sense of humor was similar to them.\n\nAnyone else relate?
8	Yup. Totally. 28F here and I get ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so cute/childlike‚Äù literally all the time. My younger boufriend keeps telling me I‚Äôm like a kid all the time and it‚Äôs getting a bit annoying tbh.\n\nIt‚Äôs also a bit annoying in professional circumstances, being cute and kind makes people think you‚Äôre either not doing your job well or that they can simply play you and you won‚Äôt realize. Joke‚Äôs on them, ha.\n\nI don‚Äôt relate to the kids part that much though. I never knew how to talk to kids or old people, or what about.
10	Not at all. Actually, I tend to be more reserved than most people I know. I tend to dislike people who are vulgar and obvious, because they leave very little to hide. I find people who are also reserved very interesting because getting to know them is like unwrapping a gift; there seems to be an unending list of things that I didn't know about them.
5	I take the opportunity to blow their minds.\n\nOooorr, write them off as superficial and not really worth much of my effort.\n\nBut! The most amazing feeling is when you have someone around you who can enjoy your "ditzy, childlike" self, but also appreciate, value, and use your passion and intellect as the powerhouse it can be.\n\nAccording to 16personalities.com, both Michael Scott (The Office (U.S.)) and Michael Scofield (Prison Break) are both ENFPs dispite being wildly different from each other. That blows my mind. The depth we possess often goes unnoticed by a lot of people, and it really hurts. Even Michael Scott, the beautiful idiot he is, possesses such a strong passion and desire that goes unnoticed and untapped except for key moments. And the cold, collected Michael Scofield has such a big heart that he has to keep from the world because of his childhood trauma, and the fact that he's trying to break out of a prision (which he gets sent to for the sole purpose of saving his innocent brother from the death penalty).\n\nWith all that being said, it's real pain to be painted as a one-dimensional person when we have such a multitude behind us. All we can do is strive to be understood by the people we care for, and find understanding people to care for us.
5	I'm actually quite reserved around people I don't know that well... but once I get close and "reveal the Real Me^(TM") I start getting called cute too... and yes it *does* mean I'm often taken less seriously...   \n\n\nI'm trying to find balance between staying true to myself and keeping the serious aura when needed but it's not easy.
3	Yeah, ditzy check, exaggerated emotions check and sense of humor matching that of 3-4 year olds plus love being with them check. Now do tell me where do I sign if this is like a full time job opportunity?
2	I've gotten the same estimation by people that I'm acquainted with, not my friends or family so much\n\nI am pretty scatterbrained though (>\^-\^)> 
2	hmm. some of it yeah, i'm male though so my temperament is more mellow. I wouldn't say people think of me as childlike, maybe in my imagination and wonder for things, but not my behaviour. I've definitely been referred to as ditzy and airheaded before lmao. a girl once said I show my emotions on my face a lot so that's also a thing
2	Yes of course! I love it when I get to blow someone's mind away though, when they realize I have incredible intellectual stimulation to provide them! They are like "hey, you are just a big kid, how do you know so much about the universe and neuroscience?"
2	I ghost wrote this post
1	Unfortunately yes... Kills any respect people have for me at work.
1	You're not alone. I'm 20 and while I've been described by others as mellow, I still feel like a 5-year-old inside--I often think others perceive me as such. In a field I'm good at like writing, art and music, I feel more comfortable and confident in what I'm doing. However, there are times when someone asks me to do something and I easily overthink it and end up doing something stupid. I used to really struggle because I didn't know how to use common sense (a skill which I've discovered that I have--I just don't always use XD). I'm pretty scatterbrained and have to write stuff down to keep track of everything. I don't always pay attention like I should and find myself randomly bumping into walls and knocking stuff over. This is especially bad when you sleep in a bunk bed and something falls from about 9 feet up and makes a huge CRASH in the middle of the night, waking up the rest of your family with your mom and dad shouting, "ARE YOU OKAY?!!!"\n\nI used to work in childcare and often felt more comfortable working with kids rather than being with adult. I now work in retail. I feel more comfortable now on my new job and think that it's essential for my personal growth and maturing into "adulthood". I found myself getting really stressed out one day with my managers standing overtop of me watching my every move. Funny thing is that they were super nice and trying to help me but I get intimidated fairly easily, even when no one is mad at me. I'm a huge overthinker XD\n\nBut you're not alone. I think that's one misconception that people think when it comes to ENFP's. They think we're a bunch of babies who are immature when in reality, we are highly intelligent, emotional beings who thrive on adventure and new things. 
1	As a 26 year old dude, I'm fortunate to not have those ditzy/airhead/cute labels put on me. Which doesn't mean that I don't act the same way, its just how people perceive male vs female ENFPs. Sometimes however I come off as condescending, at least that's how it seems. In my mind I'm being encouraging and engaged by nodding along and saying "yep, mhm, that's interesting, etc." \n\nBut yeah, I also wear my emotions on face and exaggerate them too. One time I was getting lunch with some coworkers and they were cracking up over how excited I was at the server explaining to me how they make their pork rinds in house. They definitely thought it was *cute*. \n\nFWIW I've had plenty of guys think I'm gay because of things like this. If someone is talking to me I want them to feel valued, validated, and as though what they have to say matters. So sometimes this means listening to a guy dominate a 30 minute conversation about how hes gotten into brazilian jujitsu and it changed his life, and I nod along, smile, try to relate, and reiterate the points he makes about how its impacted his life. Some guys think I'm flirting with them. But pretending to care is better than letting him know that the conversation is boring to me. \n\nAnyway. Its good to kinda understand what people's first impressions of you are. If you don't like it you can work to change it. Otherwise just know that you are deeper than it looks on the surface, and use that to your advantage when you can. 
1	Whenever someone tells me this, it represents to me that this person has lost touch with his inner youth. Don't give into what they're saying. You're not ditzy and childlike. Some part of you are, but that's not the whole picture. You're also mature, and mature people can relate to 3-4 year old in an authentic way, that's not weakness or digression of character. There is just more to you in that area of life. But you're also a child. Get what I am saying?
4	Weekly Support Thread	\n/r/ENFP has always been and will always be a place that lends an ear. Large or small, get it all off your chest. In this corner of the internet, you will be heard. We are here to support one another. We are all we have.\n\nThis doesn't replace the individual posts; it's just another avenue to start talking, MBTI related or not. Sometimes you need to check in more than once before you feel restored. That's what we're here for.\n
3	Been struggling with a few things in the past year and a half. Ive learnt to accept myself, i know why i do what i do and why i am who i am (thanks r/ENFP). But i always have a few problems. (btw im 16)\n\nThe main one being that ive been deprived of physical contact for a while and i feel a thing called skin hunger (having a crave, a need for physical contact, hugs, cuddling in general, with someone more significant). I have a few friends who help me out and give me those good hugs but im talking about having that person to cuddle with.\n\nBecause of this as happy and bubbly as i am, on the inside i feel a weird void (especially at night). A weird feeling on my chest. It tones down emotions and i feel empty. When i found out it was something to so with relationships i finally broke down (ofc no1 knows).\n\nI know that most people i know think im attractive, i know i can get a gf and im just waiting for someone that I'm attracted to but its not just physical. I want sth meaningful with someone who is thoughtful (the trait im valuing the most is intelligence).\n\nI also know that its just about waiting. But i need a fix. And since it has to do with my personality you guys maybe can help me out?\n\nPs: no hugging my parents doesnt do much. Im talking some deeper stuff because its not just skin hunger i also feel lonely. I know i have friends but i changed school and now its all superficial. also 90% of my current "friends" are really dumb and really basic. They are fun but you cant talk about anything decent (so basically only girls for "one night stands"
73	I struggle with severe anxiety and depression and I have a lot of problems I face in my life. But when it comes to facing the problems or taking the steps to deal with them I procrastinate them because the whole "planning the solution" is too stressful. Does anyone else deal with anything like this?	Any tips perhaps? 
20	I would suggest trying therapy. If you can't afford it try your local county mental health clinic like I did. Or if you can get on a medicaid insurance so therapists take those kinds of insurances. And if you are scared to try it just think of it as a doctor. If you have a cold you see a doctor, this is no different.
24	Yes I often have felt overwhelmed. Try making a list of 5 easy things you can do today that will make you feel better. Try hard to complete all 5. Make at least 1 of the things a self care item. Tiny changes over time turn into big change. 
10	I'm the exact same way. I have a lot of anxiety and deal with depression which has caused me to procrastinate and be indecisive in very important areas in my life. I've been very stagnant and that has made my feelings of depression even worse.\n\nI looked honestly at myself and decided what I want in my life right now (a degree, significant people close to me, a healthy living plan, time for hobbies etc) and I started making changes in my life to move it in that direction. Step by step, it's not a fast process. But once you start and start noticing the difference, it really helps the momentum. There will be days that you dont aant to do anything, so don't if you don't have to. I still spend weekends watching Netflix. \n\nMake appointments you need to make, go to them. Call your friends, make new ones. Adventure by yourself, adventure with a friend. Write in a journal. Paint a picture. Make your bed!\n\nMake healthy decisions. Choose healthy thoughts* Thinking optimistically has a huge impact on how you handle your day to day thought process. Pay attention to your thoughts and turn them around when they start to get dark.\n\nAnd definitely, if you feel like this is a life long problem and not just a right now thing, talk to your doctor about how you can get help. I just did and I'm so happy to be on the path to getting my mental health sorted. \n\nEdit: I never touched on Positive Affirmations and Mindfulness so I updated a line
4	I feel this. Like, procrastination = more stress over substantially less time?
5	Yes, I too fall into this category. The stagnant part is so accurate and I've found the answer is to try and pick what is most realistic in your choices whether it is job related, significant other related, or hobby. I find that I have trouble choosing between things because I'll take all* options into consideration, even those I really wouldn't pursue, yet I still want to do them! Therefore it is imperative to rule out anything you know isn't for you, as cool as it may sound.\n\nLastly, no matter what you choose, you can always change your mind whether you're one week in or one year. 
3	I feel that way sometimes but normally  when I actually start getting the gears grinding and I'm actually down on my back checking shit out under my car or whatever, it never feels as bad when you're in the middle of doing something. Like when thinking about it ahead of time it's easy to feel all sorts of ways about doing ANYTHING. Just like jumping out of bed in the morning when you're ganna be late, you just need to dive into that problem, get it done, and then remember the next time that it is never so bad when you are in the middle of doing it. Not to mention putting effort out to fix issues or whatever is a positive feedback loop. 
3	oh yeah, trying to figure out solution with all the Ne possibilities floating around, and not sure which one is the best COA because you can see all the many different solutions that play out in twenty different ways.\n\nI hear ya man, I hear ya. I am finding this where I have to be more "practical", (blah hate that). I am sticking to solutions that make more common sense. That is working for me so far, a pain in the ass, but working.
2	Are you me?
2	This is me :(
1	Yo i understand, im in the same damn boat
1	journalling helped me immensely, as an extroverted feeler it helped me hone my Introverted Feeling skills and understand myself and my situation from a new perspective.
1	Yes and honestly that‚Äôs part of depression. What helped me was my mom making an appointment with me to see a therapist and seeing to it that I went. She actually drove me there lol it helped a lot!

5	worried I won‚Äôt find something to motivate and keep me engaged long-term	Just found this sub and it‚Äôs great! I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm just posting this to vent or what, but any and all advice is welcome. I‚Äôm having a hard time breaking this cycle I always find myself in, and now that I realize it‚Äôs just part of my personality, I guess I‚Äôm just looking for ways to cope. So far, I haven‚Äôt found anything (career-wise) that‚Äôs piqued my interest long enough to imagine staying for more than a few years. After college, I found a cool design job in my hometown. I‚Äôm an artist so this was ideal; good corporate benefits, loved my co-workers. Stayed for a few years, but something deep inside of me was drawing me away from the monotonous routine of a Midwest office job and toward the ocean so I quit my job, packed a car, drove to the west coast where I knew NO ONE and took up scuba diving for a living (not as easy as it sounds but at the time, it felt like life or death, so I made it happen). I was living my dream! You mean I get to lose myself in the beauty of the ocean day after day and witness true joy in people? Yes please! But after a few years, I realized this wasn‚Äôt sustainable; the thing I loved so much was becoming work, thus losing its appeal. I wasn‚Äôt making enough money to survive, and I found myself starting to crave the stability of an office job with benefits again. So I found another design job and at first it was great, exciting, so relieving! I‚Äôm not struggling (as much) to pay rent, I have my weekends back, it‚Äôs great! ...But here I am two years later and the monotonous routine is getting to me again. When I start to get bored with something, my mind wanders, my performance suffers, and I don‚Äôt want that to happen. My employers have all liked me a lot, I‚Äôm easy to get along with, I ease tension between other people in the workplace, and I think when I‚Äôm motivated by something, I can be insanely productive. But it comes and goes and at the end of the day, deep down I know the t-shirt I‚Äôm being paid to design isn‚Äôt really helping humanity in any way, so I get bored. Like, I‚Äôd rather go on a cool hike and meet a new tree than work overtime for you.\n\nI‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm never going to find that thing that truly captivates me, that grabs me and pulls me in so hard I can‚Äôt imagine ever doing anything else! \n\nI have no desire to start a business or climb a ladder; I‚Äôm not motivated by money and I‚Äôm frustrated that I need it to survive. \n\nAnyone have any words of wisdom? I feel like I‚Äôm always just barely scraping by, and I don‚Äôt know why I do it to myself. 
2	Treat your job like a job. Get a hobby/sideline where your passion/interest lies. That way, you don‚Äôt get to be bored of your job, because it‚Äôs just work. And you get to look forward to a hobby when you get home.\n\nThey say never let your passion become your work. Separate them.\n\nFor example, I‚Äôm a programmer. I handle clients and web projects during work hours. But after work, I have my own little projects on the side, it can be learning a new programming language, developing an app idea, or contributing to open-source projects that help a community. Bottomline is, learn to compartamentalize things in your life.
2	I feel the same way a lot when it comes to routine, I keep telling my close friends that I want to be dropped off to maintain a beautiful farm somewhere with a wonderful family I could meet, be with the animals and ride horses explore the land and the near by town I made up in my head.. make a new friend.. I know it sounds random but, I get it. I'm going to take a couple courses online to start on the path I want to go towards what I hope will lead to some kind of career that will be more meaningful and helpful to people! Start something that you love and brings meaning into your life / others lives, there's always something. It's just the getting it together that's taxing lol
1	Well what do people usually thank you for? What act of service had you feeling almost invincible afterwards? What are the things that you are really good at but for you it comes easy? What are your niches?(had recent post about that actually)\n\nThese are the questions that I asked myself that helped find me my ultimate dream. The real why to keep things moving. Which is to influence the masses through writing and speaking about emotional processing. 
7	ENFPs and Anxiety	Posting here because you all are awesome and it‚Äôs nice to know that others who are like you can relate. I don‚Äôt know many ENFPs IRL, so here goes. \n\n\nI have been struggling with anxiety as of late, and I‚Äôve been trying to work on this in therapy. I am myself a therapist, and I work with an exceedingly difficult client population, and must continue to do so until I am fully licensed. From there I can build my own private practice, but until then I am stuck working with highly suicidal individuals, and at times even abusers themselves. My anxiety manifests in that I often feel terrified that I am saying/doing the wrong things for my clients. I am also thrust into conflict situations pretty frequently. My way of dealing is that I say what I think, and then later I fret over being too rash. I feel that I am constantly seeking constructive feedback about my work performance and rarely am getting it. It is the nature of this work, I know, but it is compounded by fearing that I can‚Äôt ‚Äúsave‚Äù all my clients (especially the ones who become suicidal). \n\n\nThis anxiety also plays out in the social realm as well. When I am with friends, I am carefree and silly, and say provocative, goofy, and thought provoking things (well..at least I think they are though provoking). Afterwards I often beat myself up, and deep down I think I am really telling myself ‚ÄúAh! You were too much yourself. Now they have seen how you really are and will want nothing to do with you.‚Äù It SUCKS! I want to be unapologetically myself, but have deep anxieties about being aloof, clueless, or otherwise not self aware. I‚Äôm afraid that I am unintentionally hurting people or annoying them...or both! Growing up my parents had very limited insight into their negative behaviors and I am terrified to be like them. I‚Äôm constantly doing mental checks. \n\nDo any other ENFPs struggle with social anxiety, or just anxiety in general? Where do you think this stems from for you? What are ways that you are able to find the support you need when feeling insecure? Thanks peoples! \n\n
3	Yes, I had social anxiety disorder most of my life. In recent years I've overcome it but now have general anxiety that can be intense. I used to care so much what people thought I never did or said anything for fear of being disliked. I haven't had friends since middle school because of it and all my relations have been online or started online.\n\nI have gotten over it just from a lot of exposure to people. I worked at my county fair in the grandstand for 10 fairs and had to deal with so many people, sometimes angry or drunk. I also worked at an incoming call center and had people talking to me all day non-stop. I also was in a serious relationship and lived with her for a while. I think just getting older and maturing helped too.\n\nI have struggled with insecurity and thinking I'm ugly and a loser, boring, and many other bad things and have felt others secretly feel all these things about me but I've realized no one has ever said any of those things about me. Just me. And in fact they often say good things about me. I am starting to believe them. I used to think people were just being nice or lying or making fun of me but now I'm realizing they weren't. It has made me so much more confident. So my advice is to think of all the bad things you think others feel about you and then compare that against things others have actually said. I think you will find they don't match up and that people actually love and respect you and think you are great.\n\nI have also learned not to care what people think. I take criticism as a way to learn and even welcome it. After all how can I know what to change  and grow if I don't know what needs work? And I don't take things personally. People can have opinions but that diesn't mean I need to believe them or let them affect me. And I take it this way: say something about you, call you a name, etc.. First of all they're a jerk. But think about it this way: either they are telling the truth, in which case don't worry about it, or they are lying, in which case don't worry about it.\n\nAnother thing I learned is to think about this, how often are you thinking about others? How often are you focusing on others and their shortcomings? How often are you watching people when they come in a room or paying super close attention to them all the time in a social setting? How often are you laughing about someone behind their back when they are turned away? How often do you think about something someone said earlier and laugh about it and think bad things about it? How often do you focus on something a friend said and think bad things about them but don't tell them?\n\nYou probably don't do any of these things, at least not very often if at all. So why do you think others do? In reality you are doing what you have demonstrated, think9in about yourself and what you have done and said, either in the moment or later, over-analyzing everything. And guess what? So is everyone else. Everyone is thinking about themselves, not really focusing on others or others' behavior.\n\nAnd finally you need to love yourself. No matter what you do or say you are you and you should love you. No matter what anyone says they can never reach the deep strong core of you. Don't let others ruin your goodness. Love yourself and if others don't they aren't worth it.\n\nOnce I was able to get all these things through my head I find now I don't even think about what others are thinking. It is amazing. I think about it so little I don't even think about not thinking about it unless I read things like this and remember how I used to be. I hope that can happen for you too.
2	I used to let social anxiety rule my life from age 12-20. I'm now 24 and my best, most simplified advice is put yourself in uncomfortable social situations until you become comfortable, then step it up a notch. \n\nKnow what anxiety feels like and let it leave on it's own. Trying to force it out only magnifies the issue. \n\nI reccomend making a "hierarchy of fears" and then challenging every single one. Or, if you want much quicker results, embarass yourself in social situations. Sounds shitty because it is but it does work, and very quickly.\n\n In college I had to give tons of presentations (trigger word lol) and to combat my anxiety I would simply embarrass myself in front of complete strangers on the way to class as a way to pregame my nerves. Something simple like high-fiving strangers or just singing loudly allows your brain to realize that nobody cares about you or anything that you do. After I would get to class I felt much more loose and focused. Think of it like a personal icebreaker for you and society. \n\nWe ENFPs have fortune telling levels of intuition and it bleeds into our insecurities to form irrational thoughts. 
2	Hi! So I don‚Äôt suffer from anxiety, but I‚Äôve had anxiety in my life throughout college due to a lot of health trauma that happened. I can‚Äôt offer much advice except this golden nugget: \n\nMEDITATE !!!! \nREALLY focus on deep breathing through your diaphragm, even when you‚Äôre not meditating.\n\nI also recommend listening to the audiobook of Eckhart Tolle‚Äôs ‚ÄúA New Earth: Awakening to Your Life‚Äôs Purpose.‚Äù\n\nBelieve in yourself. Honor yourself. Love yourself. Know what you are worth. You are kick ass and a caring, intelligent person. Protect your boundaries! Being your authentic self 100% will prevail in your favor in the end.\n\n
2	I have had that anxiety, it‚Äôs depressing! I started lots of mental and physical self-care and meditation as well as just hanging out with myself and enjoying my own company. Once you‚Äôre drinking in your own coolness you‚Äôll realize how desirable a friend you are. Once that happens its automatic confidence! \n\nI wish I had a friend like you! Keep being a great human and know that the only person‚Äôs behavior you can control is your own. You can show someone the way out but, they may not have the perspective or the open mind you do to take it. \n\nI lost a family member to suicide a few years back. I was rewinding and trying to think what I could have done differently. I remember one quote I heard somewhere that helped me. It explained that choosing to live or die both take courage. All moral questioning aside, ultimately, I believe its the choice of the individual. \n\nI knew that his pain would pass and he could live the remainder of his life completely different. He saw it differently.. its not that he couldn‚Äôt grow. The pain was too much for him in the end. 
2	I do. I know it is basically unobtainable but I of course prefer to be liked by many. I worry that I may seem too odd, etc. I also struggle to maintain my confidence and second guess myself sometimes. I am also hoping to become a therapist. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre doing great, and good luck :)
5	ENTJ (F) - How do I know an ENFP (M) likes me?	Typically have gone for INTJs in the past, but an ENFP has caught my attention. We‚Äôve built a friendship, but I think he might be interested in more. So, ENFPs, how can I tell the difference so that I don‚Äôt cross any lines and make the friendship awkward? How do you act when you like someone? 
6	ENFP dude here, when I like someone I'm generally flirty and talkative. I'm full of witty banter. My intuition tells me if they like me back and if so, I dont waste time and I ask for a date. Ask him out! 
3	It depends. If they are a friend already (jokes on me they always are), I try and rapidly increase the amount of time I spend with them and the emotional depth of our discussions. This is to make it less of a surprise for them when I ask them out, and for me to gauge if I'm going to be rejected, or rejected hard. \n\nGauge if he's friendlier with you than he is with his other friends, particularly female ones. He may also be protective of you, physically and emotionally, at least in subtle ways. \n\n I'm not very good at the whole touch escalation thing myself, feels too weird for me, so if he doesn't start doing that don't worry too much. You can also ask directly, but if he'll probably confess eventually. Enfp males, myself included, often grow more romantically inclined torwards peers over time, not less.\n\nAnyway, hope that weird ramble helps you a little. Best of luck!
2	Yeah, for sure, ask us out! It might surprise him, and surprises are awesome!   \n\n\nENFP(M) testimony
2	I am a ENFP guy with an ENTJ girlfriend so maybe I can help. When I like someone I make a lot of jokes, and sometimes they can get a bit saucy or sexual. Flirty. I also ask them tons of questions because I want to know everything about them and tell them everything about me. Honestly it's hard for me to know exactly since I end up liking pretty much any girl I've ever talked to for more than a little.\n\nBut if you do end up getting together I have some advice. Communicate. Tell each other what is bothering you and what you want. I know it can be difficult for eNTJ's to express their feelings sometimes or insecurities or things they are sensitive about but it is not weak. It is strength and it will strengthen the relationship. Don't put up more walls, try to open up. Also realize you two are different. You are probably someone who focuses intently on one thing while he, an ENFP, is a multi-tasker and can seem to jump from one thing to the next and sometimes from serious to goofy very suddenly. Don't let it overwhelm you and try not to let things get to you. If he offends you or upsets you it is almost certainly unintentional so tell him about it and exactly what he did and how to avoid it in future. Don't make him try to guess.
2	Hi! ENFP (F) here and my bf for about 2 years is an ENTJ. Look - I might be going in a different directions here. When I first met my bf and was charmed by him I was being witty and trying to keep the banter going. But I think about 2 months in I felt something more serious feelings towards him and for some reason I went all quiet and shy around him lol :D Be mindful that this might happen as some ENFP here as I read previously experienced the same thing. When this happens, I urge you to just go for it! We love your directness! That was my bf did at the time, he felt something was off and he asked me why. I was being honest with him and what I love about ENTJ is that you guys never beat around the bush. So he offered me the idea of being a couple and the rest is history :)
1	Ask him out! I don't think it will be awkward as long as you're ok with him saying no. Taking initiative is super attractive to me (although I'm a girl, but I think it's the same for guys)
10	I know it's all relative, but remember to be grateful!	
2	You're right. Thanks for the reminder! 
5	Any enfp folks into astrology?	I have a Taurus moon, gemini rising, sagittarius/capricorn sun. Honestly having a cusp sign is so difficult.  
5	Iirc, astrology has been decisively disproven by modern science; however, all this means is ALL the stars are yours, not just a few :)
2	libra squad where u at
1	astrology is so overrated. it has already been debunked. go search about the 'barnum effect'
1	I have never really believed in it but someone on Facebook posted about it and how it is a very unlucky time right now or something according to astrology? And it has been the most unluckiest time in my life and for my whole family. It's insane. My girlfriend was in a car accident. Then something very bad happened to me I'm still dealing with. Then her aunt found out she had cancer. Then my uncle found out he might have cancer. Then my aunt today slipped and broke her elbow. :O
1	I like reading about astrology, though I don't believe in it. It's more of a just for fun thing for me.
1	For any fellow ENFP dealing with post-breakup feels

12	How do you stay focused?	Hi fellow ENFPs. It seems that ADD type behavior is very common with us. \n\nRecently I realized I'm very very bad at focusing on things. This is probably why I was super bad in school and now at work. There is a 'To-Do' list in my head, but every time I wake up, I end up going on my phone for a few hours (like right now) and I know that I should have read a book or finish up my portfolio. I've been 'so called' working on my portfolio for a year now. It should have been finished last year, which could have helped me get a new job. Now I'm unemployed and I'm still struggling with finishing it up. This isn't an art portfolio btw. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are other things I need to do such as: lose weight, eat healthy, reading, brushing up on english and math, learning other programing languages. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI always find myself either doing none of them, or starting and never finishing. If I was focused, I would have reached my goal weight 15 years ago. If I was focused, I would have been more smart and gone to grad school. If I was more focused, I could have made a lot of things and people would take me seriously and I would be of value, but my life has just been full of unfinished projects, unfinished informative knowledge, unfinished life, and unfinished career. Everything feels so half assed. It's so bad that I have to teach myself English (grammar, punctuation, forming sentences) and math (fractions,  percentage, and stats) again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt really sucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR - How do you stay focused long enough to finish something or reach a goal?
4	Hi there fellow ENFP,\n\nI also get distracted. And yes, people don't take me seriously because of this. I hate it. I hate it so much that sometimes I wish I wasn't an ENFP.\n\nBut I am, so I devised a way:\n\nI keep doing one task. No matter what other distraction there is, I keep doing the one specific task or the one specific goal.\n\nWhat's my task?\n\nI'm a freelance writer. I write for websites and agencies. But there's a downside of being a freelancer. I don't have a social life. \n\nSo, every now and then, I think of changing my career. Get into sales or teaching or something with more social interactions. \n\nBut do you know what I do?\n\nI just let the thoughts rest. I keep writing. And eventually the thought dies out. A great inspiration for me is Elon Musk. He isn't an ENFP but he is super-focused. If he takes up something, he achieves it. \n\nI hope my advice helped. 
1	I feel you so much right now. \n\nWhat worked for me is reframing everything. Its not that I wasn't focused enough, I just didn't prioritize (x) enough. If your only goal every day is to keep living, then thats what will happen but you might not achieve much, for example. \n\nDevelop an idea of the person you want to be. You want to be the foolsmate that eats healthy? Develop an idea of what healthy eating is to you (theres lots of ways) and then execute. The only difference between you today and your goal is doing it. Every time you get hungry, every time you even think about food, make conscious decisions about what to eat. Are you the kind of person who eats the junk or eats the healthy food? Your decisions are what makes you. \n\nThe same goes down the line, but it becomes easier as you add more discipline since those new habits start to form. 
1	I use the pomodoro technique :)
1	Focus is a learned behavior for me. So I'm not naturally good at doing it. Sometimes I'm still really, really bad at it. But it's the continuing to try, continuing to make one thing at a time important enough to do *when I don't feel like it*, continuing to do the prep that sets me up for success....all that continuing is what has taught me focus. I have to write things down, I have to commit to a routine (not a schedule, that make me die inside, just a general outline), I have to make tiny goals and not obsess over big ones (like drinking x amount of water on this day, not focusing on losing 20 pounds, and going from there). It is the hard part for ENFP types that what we value is often made up of daily disciplines. We want to already be in the galaxy, not sit around checking equations to build the rocket. But everything has to start somewhere. \nGo to bed an hour earlier than usual and wake up 20 min earlier than usual for a week, use a regular alarm clock rather than your phone, and keep your phone on its charger in another room. Do it for 1 week and see how you feel. Not promising it will help, but again, you gotta start somewhere...and usually the "somewhere" is not a very romantic beginning. 
1	I get distracted so easily...  i usually hit my vape and try to focus my attention on one task at a time. People think im super dumb and clumsy if i try to do 2 tasks at once...
1	I let my passion take over my focus. This is exactly why I need to find the best career and goals for myself. When you love the work you do, you are invincible, and if you don't know what that is, keep searching. You'll  go through a lot of failures, but you will find it because if you are serious in knowing, your efforts will add up to something grand. My advice: search for your passion and act upon them. Good luck!
1	You need to stick to a program. Focused thinking has to be trained for us. The experience gained builds on. We naturally gravitate to diffuse thinking but having the ability to focus is really great and calming.\n\nDario Nardi had presented once to google employees that an enfps brain lit up once it had gone through loads of practice and is able to rehearse in a state of flow. Having a program to follow forces us the necessary practice.\n\nOnce you've acquired the ability to focus, you won't look back.
2	Is Will Smith ENFP or ESFP	
5	ENFP superheroes in movies/TV shows?	I love superheroes and I was wondering who could be ENFP's? I think I might have some ideas:\n\nBarry Allen from The Flash- He's a team leader who seems emotional and optimistic, is very passionate about his speed and gets depressed whenever he loses it. Deeply supported by family and friends and capable of motivating just about anyone.\n\nMiles Morales from Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse- Literally the first five minutes of the film should say a lot. Listening to music and drawing in his cluttered bedroom, didn't pack for school yet, has quite the number of friends. Has never seen his true potential until >!circumstances and loved ones push him.!<\n\nPeter Parker from Spiderman: Homecoming? - Dorky, friendly, laid back, strategies always revolve around thinking outside the box.\n\nThose are some of the ones I can come up with. What do you guys think? Agree or am I wayy off? Who are some potential others?
3	Well, I mean, ENFP  is often labeled ‚Äúthe champion‚Äù or ‚Äúthe hero‚Äù and in alignment charts, we usually get the main character, so a lot of superheroes are probably ENFP.
4	Shazaam
2	All spideys are amazing, though it could be argued that most are introverts.  not exactly a "superhero" per say, but Aang could fit the bill pretty well. Also, Kirishima from BHNA gives off pretty big enfp vibes
1	Just searched because I was curious. Different articles forums said Harley Quinn, Nightcrawler, She-Hulk, Jubilee (X-Men), and someone said Magneto might be. A Marvel chart showed Professor X, Balder, Sue Storm, and Captain Britain.\n\nhttp://mentalfloss.com/article/65218/10-myers-briggs-type-charts-pop-culture-characters
1	This is kinda a bummer, I thought ENFP's generally liked superhero shows and movies. 
1	I've actually googled this a couple of times, but most finds just state Harley Quinn (she's cool though) and call it a day. 
144	I feel like the ENFP identity is a swirling mass of excited emotion and vulnerability, and so this piece really called out to me.	
21	‚ÄúSwirling mass of excited emotion and vulnerability‚Äù \n\nNAILED IT
7	Wow this is amazing and takes my breath away. I think you‚Äôve tapped into a deep dark mysterious place inside of all of us. No wonder INFJs and ENFPs can be so close. You are so special and your soul is so beautiful. Please keep doing your art work. You are an artist in many ways. I‚Äôm so glad I got to see your work. 
6	Its really wierd of those ENFP‚Äôs i know (including myself) they are either super vulnerable or they are not at all
5	Yes the nature of Fi is a swirling mess of excited emotions and vulnerability.  You poor ENFPs =)
4	Then Acid is definitely the thing for you.   <3
2	What a display of Fi.
2	You know what‚Äôs interesting... I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of you all also gravitate to creating/admiring black & white art. I only realized recently how I lean towards working in B&W photography and even my drawings I stick to monotone. \n\nAnyone got a theory on this? \nWe love complexity in detail but sometimes neglect the color - almost as if it‚Äôs like we just wouldn‚Äôt even know where to begin adding in color once the Ne has done its thang. (At least I think that‚Äôs what it is for me. \nNe prefers intricacy in form, while Fi leans towards color/vibrancy/provoking the emotional experience (most strongly contrasted in my observations between ENFP art vs INFP art)
1	Yup that about sums it up. 
1	I vibe with this
1	Idk if I'm ENFP or any of the MBTIs anymore, all of these ENFPs seem really hqppy and I'm stuck in my own head\nI'm not vulnerable at all but I am a jokester and things do hit me hard if I let them.  I feel alone in this world
2	Finishing creative stuff?	I love art and music and everything like that but of course I fall into the very enfp trap of starting a billion projects and not finishing any of them. It's either that or I whip something up in one afternoon. I just want to finish a long-term project ONE TIME haha AHHH. Any tips? 
1	I‚Äôm going through that same struggle right now üò™
1	I like drawing, and I always have so many ideas. So I made a drawing Instagram page, and I have to finish stuff because otherwise the page would be pretty empty. So finish stuff so you can show the world :D 
2	What are the coolest, in depth, video game stories that you have experienced?	I say Xenogears, Playstation One\n\nMetal Gear Solid 1,2, and 4\n\nHeavy Rain, PS3\n\nXenosaga series, PS2\n\nKiller7\n\nDues Ex-Human Revolution\n\ncan't think of any others at the moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
3	Journey, \nLimbo,\nRime,\nInside,\nAbzu,\nBraid...\n\nThose games makes me dream as an ENFP. Just even with the Soundtrack.\n\nIt‚Äôs about the story. What it makes you feel. Forget the graphics.
2	Chrono trigger
2	Far Cry 3 for sure
1	God of War (2018) PS4 \n\nDragon Age Origins PS3/360/PC Inquisition was also very deep
1	The Bioshock stories, Metroid, Soul Searching, Metro, Borderlands.\n\nI'm sure I have already played better ones but I can't think of them atm.\n\n I think the stories of Final Fantasy, Devil May Cry and The Legend of Zelda could also be quite interesting but I'm not a fan of their gameplay so didn't really delve deep into the plots.
1	Uncharted 2, 3, 4\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2\n\nHotline Miami 1 & 2\n\nSuper Mario World SNES
1	I absolutely love Ni No Kuni! ‚ÄúNi No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch‚Äù had the best storyline of the two; in my opinion. The art work is beautiful! Almost done with the second installment‚Äôs expansion packs now. These are on PlayStation 3 & 4. Happy gaming!
1	Silent Hill 2 beats them all. No questions asked.
1	Silent Hill 2 is revered as one of the greatest games of all time. SO many people just got lost of it's symbolic story. It was way ahead of it's time with it's representation of people with schizophrenia and sexual abuse victims. Can't recommend it more! Just beautiful.

7	How do you guys notice you inferior Si's?	&#x200B;\n\nPersonally I feel like it makes me very reclusive every once in a while, just to avoid being surprised/my plans being messed with.
7	Someone on this sub said a few days ago that they felt like they sometimes engaged in internal conversations and the voice was like "an elder that takes no shit from anyone and knows what to do" (I'm paraphrasing). But yeah Si is super crucial the more you age, it's basically the rudder on the ship that is ENFP. I'm actively trying to develop it because it helps with follow-through and concrete evolution. 
4	For some reason it‚Äôs really easy for me to hate someone‚Äôs guts. Anyone else relate?	Usually just my gut feeling. For example I had a teacher in high school who was quiet wealthy from what we all assumed was inherited money. He became a stereotypical rich jerk and every math question became about him about him and money. This is just one example but when I come across these people I automatically have a massive set against them. 
7	I think that when someone seems morally unjustifiable, it‚Äôs not hard to turn off all positivity towards them.  Being a braggart, acting superior to others, and generally just unkind behavior always turns me off.  I try to ‚Äúcrack the egg‚Äù with people like this before I give up entirely though. This has been a lot easier as an adult than it was when I was younger though. In high school and college I made snap judgements about people, but now in my early 30s I‚Äôm pretty tolerant to a point. Once someone proves to be morally bankrupt, I shut them out entirely.
5	No. I find it easy to love soneone's guts though. :p\n\nBut seriously I don't judge people easily. I walk in their shoes, figure out how I would feel in their situation and I learn to understand them. See things from every perspective. It doesn't mean I agree with them but I understand how in that situation they got to how they think.\n\nThis is usually an ENFP thing, seeing all the possibilities with Ne and how we would feel in all those possibilities with Fi.\n\nTry to be more open-minded and not judge as much. You don't know what a person has been through or who they really are inside. But if they are an actual bad person who hurts others, etc. then feel free to judge or take action. But don't judge too quickly in case you're wrong. And remember people can change.
3	Rude and ungrateful people piss me off, but I don't hate them.  Usually makes me wonder what the underlying cause is and to better understand the issue or bring out the better in them.\n\nOthers, like your teacher, also set off tons of red flags to me.  Someone to be extremely cautious of, but not necessarily dislike.  The red flags could be anything from is this person looking for help to will this person stab me in the back as soon as possible.
2	My Ne thinks about the possibilities and my Fi wants to feel good and my Te wants to learn from others. \n\nSo if someone seems boring (Ne turnoff), an asshole (Fi turnoff), and not someone I'd like to learn from (Te turnoff) then I'm probably going to give absolutely no shits about them. For me to hate someone though they'd need to cross a certain line, depending on context. But I'm definitely not a fan of boring dumb assholes, and rich jerks are often boring dumb assholes who think they aren't boring because of their wealth and that they aren't dumb because of their wealth. 
2	for the most part, I love everyone. That being said, there are a few people who I rly dont like. namely, people who dont understand teh feelings of other people, and act on whats "fair" above what would make everyone happy. As well, people who abuse my kind nature to manipulate me into doing crap are yucky
1	Sooo... I love basically everyone, but I form opinions very quickly. I definitely judge people in my head, but I try not to let my judgement affect how I interact with them because I want to have positive relationships even with those who are less-than-positive. There are select individuals that make doing so near impossible though. 
2	Any Enneagram 8s out here?	I was wondering. What are your experiences of having both an ENFP mind and an 8 body. (this is how it feels for me, but of course you can have your own interpretation).\n\nHow do you think these two classifications, but also most importantly these two different parts of your personality work together in your life?\n\nAlso compared to other ENFPs, and other 8s.\n\nWhat makes us the type of 8 that almost nobody believes exists?\n\nLot's of question haha. Ask me things as well if you'd like. I am interested to hear what you have to say\n\nThanks.
1	I have tested 8 once I think. Other times 7w8. I got 9 before though and others. I don't really like tests because of the unreliability.\n\nBut I assume you mean you assertive and tough, maybe stubborn? Because that can be me. And sometimes argumentative. I don't like to argue but I always end up doing it. Or I'm just discussing and the other person is arguing (my girlfriend). I have become more assertive and confident in the last few years. Know what I want more, less indecisive. I used to say "Whatever" a lot or "I don't know" but now I say what I want.\n\nI think it is more developed Te. It is all about efficiency, getting things done, and often feeling like you're right. I hope it doesn't make me a dick. I don't think. There's a difference between being assertive and being an asshole. I try to be kind (not nice, since that doesn't really help people). I tell the truth. No white lies. I can be blunt. But I am trying to help people.
1	haven't had the chance to test. Where would you recommend?
45	This hits hard	
10	This is my favorite movie, and I have a tattoo of it on my back. Clementine's the one I read as ENFP though! Still, I totally feel this quote.
7	YES DAMN IT.
4	\-Quote from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
3	I have tried over the years to not be like this, it hasn't been easy. The idea of someone returning affection is powerful and, especially at a younger age, we tend to read friendliness or attention as interest. Especially because we ourselves are already interested by default. I feel you man. 
2	I'm a big Jim Carrey fan but I don't like that movie. Most ENFP's seem to though maybe those are only female ENFP's? I don't like the idea of erasing any memory but especially that of a relationship. I don't want to lose a memory of love or of myself. It is part of my history and what made me me. Plus if I loved someone I will always love them at least a little and never want to lose a piece of my heart.\n\nAs for the quote yeah I get that. I find it hard to be just friends with a girl. I automatically start feeling things for pretty much every girl I meet to some degree. But if they are nice and friendly? Oh man. If they even seem like they like me at all I fall right head over heels. Even if we are different the thought of someone liking me makes me like them. Thus any friendliness automatically makes me think they might be interested and I become interested.\n\nLike most eNFP's I'm a hopeless romantic. I just wrote this in another thread but as ENFP's we see all possibilities so why can't one of them be happily ever after with this new stranger?
2	Someone's clingy
9	Is your favorite book or movie the last one you read or saw?	I find this trait to be really common with me.  I fall in love with good art and then want to share it with everyone as "the best" or "my favorite".  But this happens so often, that I'm sure I'm not just coincidentally absorbing new information at a gradual rate of improvement.  I'm just hyped.  
4	Not necessarily, but the last book I read or movie I watched is usually one I'm going to talk about, whether I like it or not. It's hard for me to single out a single book (My favorite movie is *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* but it's close between that, *Amelie*, and *Pan's Labyrinth*) so I have about three or four and my favorite one is which one of those I've reread the most recently. Right now, It's *The Gargoyle* by Andrew Davidson, which I wholeheartedly recommend, but honourable mentions goes to *A God Among Insects* by Quil Carter, which is the latest in my absolute favorite ongoing book series, to the point I approached the author on twitter to tell him how much I was loving the first book as I was reading it and now he's one of my best friends. He's an INTJ so I think that makes sense though.
2	no, my favourite movie was the first one i ever saw. lord of the rings. my favourite book i finished a year ago. 
2	I think we are just overexcited about new things
2	Hmm I am definitely mildly obessessed with whatever movie or book I just read/watched, but I cannot deny my favorite book and movie.  \n\n\nMovie: Meet Joe Black\n\nBook: Hitch Hiker's guide to the galaxy.
1	No, I stay true to my favorites until something can take those themes and ideas and build upon them and improve them.\n\nFavorite movie: Terminator 2: Judgement Day\n\nFavorite book: Fahrenheit 451 \n\nFavorite band: The Doors\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI definitely have new media that I discover that I get really enthused by but so far, these have yet to be dethroned. You should always be adding more knowledge and ideas but I think it's smart to have a consistent measure with which to compare and critique.  
1	I try to be objective, or I guess you could say consistent about subjective material.  If a movie was really that much better, was the action better?  How about the scenery?  Acting?  Music score?  Did the fight scene top my favorite movie's fight scene?  Let's me still get excited without falling into that trap of best thisthing evar.
1	No, not quite. Although I will talk a lot about what I most recently saw, I do have some specific faves that will probably not change because they‚Äôre my faves for a specific reason: they usually opened up a new way of thinking or a path, and that‚Äôs how they maintained their status throughout the years.
1	I have a hard time choosing favorites of anything and hate it when people ask me what my favorite "x" is because I can't just give a short answer. But then again I also have a hard time remembering specific details about things that are not recent, as well, so it's always easier to be excited about something I just watched or read. Anyone else have this problem?
2	F to a T?	I'm an ENFP through and through but sometimes wish I was a T! Something tells me all of these damn feelings are getting in the way of quick decision making and productivity.. Is there a way to work on this? Er.... no lol #changemystars
2	Have you studied the cognitive functions? We ENFP's do have a T function like everybody. We have Extroverted Thinking as our third function. It is focused on systems and puzzles and how things work together, organization, efficiency, and action, getting things done. To help develop this more try doing puzzles in your free time more. Not just jigsaw puzzles but like word problems, visual puzzles, organization puzzles. Try to boost your efficiency and your drive to get things done and organized in the best way. Organize your house or apartment, your closet. Really get into that mode and you may find the enjoyment of getting something done, and done the right way.\n\nTo know about cognitive functions check this: https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/if-youre-confused-about-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-read-this-an-intro-to-cognitive-functions/\n\nAnd this: https://www.typeinmind.com/nefi/
1	There are plenty of guides to become more efficient readily available on the internet. There are also guides for rational decisionmaking. \n\nForget cognitive functions. MBTI as a model is very limited in its scope. 
1	Read technical books. Te is about external systems. It should come up to a point where you can read anything and get it.\n\nIf you want to apply better Te to life, make everything a process where you're simply a product manager of your life.\n
1	Love it, thank you all. 
3	ENFP- I did something crazy today	I dunno how to start this thread cuz rn I am still feeling the adrenaline rush in my body after what I did. I want to get this off my chest now. \n\nSo today I decided to message my ex's current gf. The breakup has been 2 years already. I have moved on to a new relationship but still I cannot help my curiosity to know the true color of my ex. I still wanted to confirm my ex is a playboy who cheated on me but kept denying his secret affairs when i found out. I asked that girl if she had experienced the same shit like I did. Guess what? She is now going through what I used to go through 2 years ago when I was with my ex. My ex is still flirting with different girls behind his gf's back. He has promised to "change" for his gf but of course I know he wouldn't. Before talking to his gf, I still had doubt about our breakup but now it turns out that I have made a wise decision to leave him and move on. After all, the past relationship in which I spent days crying more than laughing was totally toxic. Now I know he's a total liar and manipulator for sure. Though I still feel bad cuz I might have ruined the girl's( his gf) day, I just don't wanna see more people get their heart broken.  \n\nNo judging. No hating. I am just an ENFP who has taken the courage to be honest with myself. Feel free to express your views if you have anything to share. \n
1	You should probably move on. It‚Äôs been 2 years. It makes you look like you‚Äôve got too much time on your hands and are still hung up on him. I don‚Äôt want to give any of my ex‚Äôs that impression. I want them to notice how much better off I am without them and how much better I am doing. I don‚Äôt think that was a smart move, but I‚Äôm not judging. 
115	I get crushes TOO easily, is this an ENFP-thing?	Guys I need help. Like the title says, I get crushes too easily. This time I‚Äôm having a huge crush on my dentist. I have a tumor in my cheek and cheek bone so I see him every week. He‚Äôs just so funny and I feel so safe with him. That‚Äôs about all it takes for me to get a serious crush on someone. \n\nIs this something you can relate to? I feel like it‚Äôs most probably an ENFP-thing so I want to know if you guys can experience the same thing? (And would it be totally wrong of me to do some flirting with him?) 
78	Can totally relate! Literally a stranger could smile at me and I‚Äôll be like ‚Äúwow what if he‚Äôs the one?‚Äù  All the time. 
64	Aww my crush is an ENFP. You guys are so dreamy and adorable
39	yeah, this part of ENFPs being all or nothing people all the time. I am the same way, when I liked someone, I really, really liked them, thought about them all the time, looked at their public facebook profile, etc. 
27	Yeah, I'm always getting crushes left and right, I just learned the hard way that people will let me down and I shouldn't idolize anyone, and focus on myself. But sure if they are reciprocating keep flirting you never know
28	I always imagine with my future life with someone even after just a pleasant conversation or a nice look. Definitely not healthy. 
21	ohhhh ya, one *genuine* conversation and im fucking SWOONing. Or if you smile at me :X
17	Yep. For example yesterday I met this Finnish dude in the train, had a pleasant and interesting conversation with him... He was too cute. Both looks and personality. And he even had that habit of drawing a little sketches to ilustrate what he was talking about I do have, too. We are never gonna see each other again but. But damn, I love him. Now excuse me, now I'm back to mourning.
17	I feel like it's cause we always see the good in people. I can definitely relate though.
17	Oh yeah ahahah people are dope and interesting and sexy and *IT‚ÄôS NOT MY FAULT I‚ÄôM WEAK AND BISEXUAL*
11	This is SO creepy. I was about to write this EXACT thing.\n\nI crush on so many people. Then I get nervous around them until the crush goes away. Worst with newly gained friends.\n\nI guess it's a mix with us being optimistic dreamers and seeing a lot of the best in people
11	I can relate AF, it's just every time I "like" someone it then suddenly becomes "I wanna have kids with them". Yet the cool part is: reason always tells me "dude, you said this for too many girls before this one, how do you know this is actually the ONE" - other me: "I know, she is THE ONE" - one week later, after the whole hype disappears it starts again with someone else. It's frustrating but the nice thing is I could say I can willingly crush on someone haha
8	lolll this is so crazy hahaha . but no I don't relate, and I had brace for three years, and I saw my dentist every month.\n\nI'm pretty slow in dating, it takes at least few months to put my doubts aside and start to like someone. 
7	Is nobody going to link Someone New by Hozier? \n\nFine. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/bPJSsAr2iu0
5	Same tho. 
6	100%. Who I'm interested in will change based on who I've seen most recently. 
5	incredibly relatable, wow. i get attached to people way too easily and it's so annoying >:-(
5	i feel the exact same way, one good conversation and i'll literally LOSE SLEEP OVER YOU. \n\nbut also another question relating to this- is falling *out* of love quickly also an ENFP thing? I tend to crush really, really, hard for a month or two, put all my time and effort into a person, and then instantly wake up one day not liking them. for no reason at all. (the trouble is by then, my charisma's gotten to them and now they love me.) do any other ENFPs have similar experiences? 
3	Lol big same
3	Man, I almost feel like I cycle through people in the groups I hang out in. Just little infatuations that pop up for a short bit of time. I generally try to ignore them...they pass.
3	It's most definitely an ENFP thing. You know what's really a bitch, though? Often times, we're not romantically interested in someone but our personality comes off as flirty. So, when it comes to our type, you either get someone who is a tease or someone who is clingy. It's a struggle.
3	I get alot of virtual crushes or crushes on video games characters or novel protagonists, actors, store clerks you name it! I start feeling so sad that they aern't real, the perfect boyfriends, sigh.
3	YES! Happens to me. Its not like crush per se but its very similar. I get excited to see this person, I take extra care to be presentable. I flirt and be all happy giddy round them etc. But it doesn't really evolve into romances, usually just good friendship with that extra interesting bond. I feed on this type of relations, they keep my need of novelty in check. 
3	I'm supposedly ENFP and I rarely meet a girl I'm attracted to I guess I'm picky
3	Dude this is exactly how me and my current boyfriend started datingüòÇ (we've been together for over a year now) but I literally had one good conversation with him and realized how cute he was and then I started talking to him and thinking about him non-stop and then we started datingüëåüòÅ
2	So it's not only me it seems.
2	Definitely. I had a huge crush on my psychiatrist. He was kind of a dick, but he is funny, so there‚Äôs that. Lol. He‚Äôs probably 30 years older than me but feelings are feelings. Lol so many feelings ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòé
2	I have this and I hate it. I feel like it gives the impression that I'm desperate. 
2	Most ENFPs I know: hell yes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe know: I develop *infatuations* easily, but it takes a particularly amazing individual to give me butterflies nowadays.\n\nKeyword: limerence
1	I can relate for sure.  When I'm into someone, I'm *really* into them. I guess what's important is that you're self-aware of this trait so you can act on it in the best way for you... Me personally, I'm recently out of a long term relationship so I really don't want any serious relationships right now. Which can be *really* hard when you can easily fall for someone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhether you want to act on it or not, just be aware that disappointment and heartache are possible outcomes of throwing yourself out there. That's just the nature of dating and trying to get to know someone. If you don't think you're prepared for that possibility and/or you don't think you're able/willing to try to take things slow, I'd suggest holding off. \n\nOtherwise... just go for it! I don't know if it's an ENFP thing but I know I definitely have FOMO tendencies. But the next person doesn't have to be *the one.* It's possible to enjoy the company of someone without committing your entire life to that person.   \n\n\nOn a kind of related side note, I don't know if there's any data regarding ENFPs and polyamourous relationships but I feel like ENFPs would be much more suited to that type of lifestyle just because they often have so much love to give. I'm not saying I necessarily condone or endorse it, and I don't have experience with it myself. But I'm certainly curious about the number of ENFPs that do choose that lifestyle and whether it works for them.
1	totally. 
1	Oh my gosh ME TOO!!! it's such a pain. I had a HUGGEEE crush on one of my professors and it was just a big YIKES. Before that it was a guy in my class. (People that give me a lil more attention than usual lol) distance and knowing that I dont really really like them I just enjoy their attention helps me 
1	No, not an ENFP thing. I think this is me too. But maybe my criteria for "too easily" varies from yours to the degree that my experience isn't comparable.
1	Yesssssss. God I get obsessed easily 
1	Omg. Thank god it‚Äôs not just me!!! I fall so easy and get attached sooo easy!! I just started a friends with benefits relationship with someone when we both agreed we both were not in a place for a serious relationship and I obviously got overly attached to us.
1	I have a crush on everyone I've ever met
1	Yes!!!! It‚Äôs very easy for me too to get tiny crushes, and a LOT of the time friend crushes. Especially when I‚Äôm not in a relationship, it‚Äôs like whoever gives me ~special attention~ first gets all of me
1	I think it's true when you're younger. Lately I've been reading my diaries from when I was in middle school and high school and pretty much every other month I'm gushing about how in love with some dude I am (90% of them I had to look for in my yearbooks because I couldn't even remember who they were) granted, I graduated hs nearly 20 yrs ago 
1	I used to be like this when I was young but not anymore. I feel like this fades with more life experience. 
1	Do you ever feel guilty when it‚Äôs someone you‚Äôre not supposed to have a crush on? Like when it‚Äôs my direct manager, if they‚Äôre cute and caring, it‚Äôs over I‚Äôm swooning. \n\nI once crushed on the dad of the family I nannied for! It passed though. No one found out. He kept his distance from me and wasn‚Äôt too nice or anything. I just like thought he was so sweet with his kids. Aaaawe  
1	I relate too hard to this. It makes me so sad. I can genuinely see a life well spent with so many of the wonderful people I meet. And all of those lives look different. Children. Pets. Arty. Travelling. Settled. If that connection is there then I want to expand on it. I actually find it really difficult at times to let go of those crushes too. üò≠\n\n(I will just say that it‚Äôs normally a slow process btw just to elaborate. But once I identify there‚Äôs what I consider chemistry; that‚Äôs it üòÖ)
1	It‚Äôs also easy to THINK you have a crush, but be over it after a day or two.
1	We're hopeless romantics. We see all the possibilities so why can't one of those be happily ever after with this cool new person?
1	Yeah. Sometimes I feel like this is a curse but then I realize the right person will love me for this someday. I‚Äôve pretty much made the same deal with myself no fwb only possible dating cuz I suck at fwb.
1	I'm laughing because this is very me and I hate it
1	Hahahahaha we‚Äôve talked about this.
1	Not really lol, but that's funny!\n\nI rarely ever develop interest or a connection with someone for some reason, but when I do it seems to happen fast like I'm unaware of why 
1	Does this ever work out for anyone? LMAO I get this a lot..
5	It's Too Excited Tuesday!	\nCAN I GET A HELL YEAH?! It's Too Excited Tuesday! Unleash the happy!\n\nWhat makes you excited? :D\n
13	ENFP and highly agreeable. How can I be more assertive?	Anyhow has resources or tips for me to become more assertive in relationships and also professionally. I am a 27-year-old woman, doctor and friendly. In fact, I think I am too friendly and I make a lot of effort to ensure that I don't offend anyone and no one is left out. I feel that in a social setting I am too externally focused and not so much in sync with how I feel or with how I think. I find myself agreeing to things I probably shouldn't. My mind is super critical but I am too cautious to be critical and speak my mind, in case the person hearing it won't like my opinion.   \n\n\nI am in a relationship right now with someone I don't really want to be with. He's nice and all but I just find him boring but I just can't bring myself to break up with him. He's going through exams for the past 3 months and I have been hesitating from breaking up with him worrying that if I do, it'll affect him in his exams. Now that his exams are nearly over, I feel a certain obligation to stay because I made plans with him and I don't want to break my commitments AND ITS A GODDAMN ENDLESS CYCLE.   \n\n\nThis is just one of the situations in which I found myself in because of this "agreeableness". What do you fellow ENFPs think? What would you advise me?  \n\n\nThank you <3
10	When I originally learned about being an ENFP, I read a quote from a CEO that said something along the lines of 'being agreeable and collaborative to the point of my own detriment'. I resonated deeply with that and have made a real effort to be more assertive and direct. However, even at my most direct, I'm probably still not as direct as some or even as I think I am being. I guess what I'm saying is that you can probably afford to be more assertive than you think you are being, because your default will always be to not be. And because you're like that, when you actually tell people what you think, rather than saying what you think they're wanting to hear, you'll be much more convincing.\nCan't help on the relationship side of things, but let this be an encouragement that when you're being direct, you're probably not going to offend anyone, even if you feel like you are. 
5	Hmm. This is wild to me. Most times I'm overly assertive because I know I'll be angry later when I reflect and inevitably decide that I was slighted. But, I should say that this is wild to me now, but back in high school I was super super "agreeable." What helped me a lot was researching a bunch of random info so that I felt more confident and backed up in my opinions, regardless of someone else's reaction.\n\nIf you know that you don't want to be with your boyfriend, you should definitely break it off ASAP. You will feel so much more of a sense of freedom and more confident to start your new assertive life!
3	Consistency is key.\n\nI find, as male, you have to be consistent in your actions and dealings.  It doesn't mean cold and assertive necessarily, but it helps to be in a position of power.  What I mean is, if you were like me, I always felt comfortable "winging it" and taking things as they come.  As well as this may work, it leads to inconsistent dealings.  I do my homework now before giving my full take.  For example, I wouldn't repeat information that I've heard from someone else without verifying it personally.  I'd imagine that's your creed as a doctor, but of course helps with confidence which tends to be the main issue.\n\nI also prefer to act more by putting the ball in their court.  If I've done A, and B, why haven't you done C?  It shows your direction without leaving excuses.  My strength is being able to lay out my plan (which we're talented at) and letting others figure out where they need to fall in.  Gives others a gauge for expectations.  If you see yourself in a home close to work one day, lay out the vision.  Maybe he'll see he doesn't fall into that plan or if he does, he steps it up.  Hope that helps?
2	Being nice is ok, but it is better to be kind. Being nice is agreeing with everything. Being kind is being honest. For example if someone asks if they look bad in an outfit if you are nice you will say they look good to not hurt feelings or whatever. But that is not being kind because they will go out and think they look good but others will see how bad it looks and they might end up getting embarrassed. White lies or agreeing just be nice or keep harmony aren't actually good in the long run.\n\nTo really be assertive you first have to know who you are. Develop your Introverted Feeling. Be more decisive. If anyone asks you a question try never to say whatever or it doesn't matter or I don't know. Think. Feel. Even if you like one option only a tiny fraction better voice that. Get in touch with what you really want and don't be afraid to speak it.\n\nIf everyone says they want to eat at one place but yo hate it don't be afraid to say so and suggest another place. Maybe they will want to go there. Don't make your own life miserable to keep peace with others.\n\nYou have to consider yourself as a person just like anyone. If you wouldn't treat someone else badly or neglect what they want or need don't do that for you either.\n\nAs for your boyfriend, I get it. This can be a hard situation. But remember what I said first. It may seem nice to stay with him so he doesn't get upset, especially when he had exams, or because you made plans but is it really kind? Because you are a person, remember? And it is obviously hurting you. But it is also not kind to him. You don't care for him and yet you are basically pretending to. To his eyes he thinks he's with someone who thinks the world of him but that's all a facade. That kind of stinks doesn't it? Shouldn't he be with someone who really likes him? And shouldn't you be with someone you really like? Give you both that chance. As the song says sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind. Give you both the chance for real love.
2	I wish I knew more of the mentality of people like yourself who worry about being taken advantage of, so as to help. I had to go thru the Navy which was the epitome of taken advantage of someone. I feel that the key may be to recognize your value and what you bring and expecting others to fulfill their roles and obligations as friends, family and coworkers. Sometimes saying "No" when you dont want to do something or cant do something is a good start cuz it makes others realize they need to think before asking too much of you. \n\nTrying to break up with your BF is a tough one. Do not tell him it's cuz he's boring though. That would be devastating to him. Instead be honest with what you want and if he's unwilling to change or meet you halfway, then that's cause to end the relationship. Try to let him down gently but firmly. It wont be easy or painless but you need to establish your needs aren't being met. \n\nGet some more advice about the BF from other people cuz someone will have a better idea of what to do. Hope this helps.
2	End it with the boy please. Staying together longer will just make it worse. 
1	Wait until his exams are over then headshot this relationship. Life is too short to spend with people you don't click with. If you have to, think about it as a service to him too. He can be with someone who appreciates him more, and you can be with someone more enthralling.
15	Caffeine?	Anyone else not really need caffeine to function but still drink it bc it‚Äôs a lit time for us ENFP? Or is it just me lol drink a whole energy drink and jam out in my room n paint or something 
5	Yes, it's mind blowing that I'm not completely addicted to coffee since I drink at least two cups a day. I don't need it, but if I'm chilling out in the morning I'd rather be drinking coffee or tea than not.
3	I‚Äôm a full on addict and I blame Lorelei Gilmore 
3	YES! 
3	I use it as a replacement for my ADHD medications (which I need to get refilled), so I kinda low-key need it atm...
2	i used to drink coffee and energy drinks but now im caffeine free and feel better
2	Yes! I don't need it but I want it so I'm gonna have it. Makes my mornings more fun üòÅ I start every morning with some music and an iced coffee üòÅ\n\nSorry for intruding if you only wanted responses from ENFPs lol, i'm an INFJ 
2	Are you me? I love coffee and I don't need any sort of caffeine but I still drink coffee daily and even twice a day. All it does is get me more wired than I should on normal day
2	INFJ here, I didnt know i could love any type instantly until i found this thread haha. this is the cutest reason to drink coffee ever
2	Coffee or any caffeinated drink has never seemed to have a very strong impact in my level of awakeness (is that even a word? Oh well)\n\nThat said, I drink coffee for the taste and for social reasons. I love having a conversation or reading a book over a cup of coffee <3
1	YES BUT IM STILL TOTALLY CRAZY WITHOUT IT TOO 
14	Intimate ENFPs	‚ÄúGet intimate with an ENFP‚Äù should come with a warning label.\n*Friendly flirts with everybody\n*Moves like Heart in Awkward Yeti\n*Calls you weird\n*Insults you\n*ALWAYS emotional\n*Gives PDA, then disappears\n*Hugs you when you want to be alone, needs ‚Äúsolitude‚Äù when you have finished introverting\n*Expert at Cat and Mouse\n*Is probably a cat
12	You are talking about unhealthy ENFPs though.
8	üêà 
4	Can confirm, am cat.\n\nSeriously though, I relate to this back and forth thing. I feel like I can't directly give affection without coating it in a thick layer of witticism/sarcasm. Such things as "I can't say you're handsome, your head would get even bigger" and other such are basically my love language, I'm allergic to clich√©d romance (despite being a walking clich√©), and yet I'll be the first to lean in for a hug or to lean my head on someone's shoulder.\n\nI'd write my own instruction manual, but I don't even know how to guess how I'll react so something until it happens.
1	Meow\n\n&#x200B;
1	Sorry about that. When ENFPs are not in a good space we can be careless. We get distracted but the INTJ helps level us out. \n\nRemember that a good relationship is a two way street, no matter who you are!
29	Being touch starved	I broke up with my boyfriend of six months just a few weeks ago. It was the right move to make, but I‚Äôm already feeling that physical affection withdrawal. \n\nLike, bad. \n\nWhen I like someone, I literally want to be attached to them all the time. Having that skin to skin contact calms me down, makes me feel loved, honestly keeps me balanced. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I lie awake at night with a weird pit in my stomach unable to sleep because I miss having someone to sleep with so badly. \n\nI feel like ENFPs in particular would be prone to this. How do you guys deal with being touch starved so badly it‚Äôs starting to negatively impact your life?
17	Kidnap an INTJ, keep them locked in your basement, then force physical affection on them at your own whim.
9	Ummm... Look for cuddle buddies on tinder? Hug your friends more? This is a hard one. I've been touch deprived and it took a while, but eventually passed and I got used to a lower amount of touch. 
8	My love language is touch. I relate to this entirely. 
8	Lmao same lets all cuddle each other 
6	I act like hugs and closeness bother me but it's one of the few things that makes me legitimately feel better. I think some people know I dont actually hate hugs so they play along with me. I'd give you a hug, we all should try a group hug type thing. I think that would help a lot. 
8	My bed is right next to the heat vent (it‚Äôs waist level). When I‚Äôm about to go to bed, I turn up the heating and flip my blankets over the vent so it blows hot air under the blankets and especially heats up my bed up for me before I sleep. That way, it‚Äôs super warm and cozy, and I never have to go to sleep alone in a cold bed. :)\n\nYou could probably achieve the same with hot water bottles under the blankets.
4	Probably has less to do with being an ENFP and more to do with physical touch being your love language. My love language is words of affirmation, so I crave that, not really being touched. In fact, if I don‚Äôt adore you, don‚Äôt fucking touch me. Lmao 
3	I sleep with an extra fluffy pillow just for wrapping my arms around while I fall asleep. It‚Äôs not the same as a person but it helps. üòÑ
3	I TOTALLY know where you're coming from. It has been my college experience. Random hookups were my temporary solution for a while, and they really worked, until I stopped finding guys I respected lol. For now, I just try and spend time with my friends as late into the night as possible, because that's the hardest time for me if I only have the comfort of my thoughts. Also weed. Definitely weed.
1	I struggled with this and found someone on r/cuddlebuddies, and we are still good friends nearly three years later. I do think a lot of the guys on there are just thirsty and looking for a date, but there are some genuine people on there. If you have cuddle parties in your local area they can be fun too! Another option is trying a professional cuddle therapist if you have the money.
1	It's been 6 years for me. I felt the same way at first, but it dies down eventually. I'll get bouts where I'll be nostalgic for it, but it's no longer something I feel is in dire need of fixing. 
1	Have you heard of cuddle parties? Sounds weird but they are legitimate business and are run by trained professionals. You and others all cuddle in a non-sexual way with enforced rules.
1	I never encountered the term ‚Äúphysical affection withdrawal‚Äù ever in my life. Only now, and I‚Äôm in med school. Lol.
3	Big interview Friday!	So yeha guys I have a job interview Friday, the job is to be a video game planner, who besides other things is in charge of coming up with ideas for games! I really want this job, it's a part time job, kinda like "game planner apprentice", but it's fine since I'm still a student, I just really want it!\n\nAny advice, specially when it comes to answering to strengths, weaknesses, and overall what to watch out for in how I could come across.\n\nSo far I've had some interviews and they didn't pick me, but it was for a full time job, so maybe they wanted me to have a little more expierence.\n\nWhen introducing myself I like to say that I'm a passionate person who really works hard to get what I want, and I never give up!\nMy main strength I mention is to be a quick learner.\nAnd my weakness to be that when it's something that I don't feel passionate about, I tend to procrastinate doing that thing, but in order for that not to happen I try to come up with ideas for making the tasks more fun to me, so that I feel excited about doing them.\n\nI also give concrete examples of scenarios where I have used my passion, quick learning, and solved my procrastination problem.\n\nSo yeah I would like your guys input and expierence and if you want any more details feel free to ask love yall<3
2	My strategy is to usually look up who is interviewing me. Ask them about their accomplishments and what not. In my last round of interviews I looked up my interviewers and found out their history. First interview I looked up how many technical certs he had and asked how long he had them and bla bla bla we talked for like an hour and a half. Then with the next one it was the CTO, so I looked him up and saw he used to own his own small company. I asked him about running his own company and everything you had to do to keep that afloat and unexpected things he ran into. We spoke for quite a while. So inquiry them as much or more than they look into you.
1	Good luck! You sound like you have good answers. I usually say my weakness is I can be a perfectionist because that can also be a strength too.\n\nOne thing to do is to email them the day after the interview and thank them for giving you an interview and tell them if they have any questions to feel free to contact you and provide contact info again. Then if you don't hear anything in a week email again. Say how you interviewed for the game planner apprentice position and haven't heard anything and wanted to know how the process is going. Give some of you strengths and credentials for the position again and express how you are really interested in it. Then reiterate how they can contact you and provide contact info again. Then if you still don't hear anything in another week call them and basically do the same as that last email again but by phone now.\n\nThis all keeps you in there mind and also shows that you are interested. It works. It will put you ahead of others who don't do any of that. And don't forget the email day after interview because that shows gratitude and they might be miffed if you don't.\n\nHope you get it!
1	Are they toxic? How do I get rid of them without hurting them?	My friends do annoy me some times. Other times they are very dramatic and I hate the dramas. So I feel like avoiding them, but I don't have the balls to tell them because they haven't done anything wrong to me (well except that 2 friends). \n\nI always think of getting rid of these group of friends and stop hanging out with them because I am sick of it all. But they always invite me to hangout with them. How do I get rid of them without hurting them since they haven't done anything wrong? 
3	Just decline offers to come. say you are busy or have something else to do. Eventually they will invite you less and less.
2	By the way you are telling it, I feel like either 1, you really care about them and their feelings or 2, you don't really care about them but you do care about not being an asshole cause you don't want to violate your values.\nIf it's the first case, you should really talk to them, and try to figure out a way to better the friendship let them know you just want a big heart to heart free of judgment, if they don't want to or you try it and doesn't work, well you did all you could and tell them then that you are out.\nIf it's the second, yeah also talk to them, but a solution I can think of is that you kinda "ghost" but not really, you just don't initiate contact until they do, once they do, isolate one of them, the one you get along the better with and tell he or she the way you are feeling and that you want to tell the rest and maybe he or she may help you isolate them one by one so you can talk it out.\nI mean you can always just ghost them or just keep pretending that everythings fine, but I feel like that would just hurt more people in the end. 
2	About 2 years ago I lost my friend group. This was due to various reasons (I got a boyfriend, moved into a different dorm, stopped binge drinking, etc). They HATED it. I took control of my own life and it was beyond infuriating for them. To this day they still hate me. I, on the other hand, have been doing better than ever. \n\n  \nI've found myself to still be super sociable, but more wary of unstable types of people. I even have friends *now* who have toxic tendencies and I can't be around them for more than maybe an hour or two.   \n\n\nI think knowing your limit with people who make you generally unhappy is SUPER good. A lot of people are afraid to say no, to stand up for themselves, or to even take action and remove themselves from a toxic social situation.  \n\n\nAs an ENFP I can definitely say it's a lot harder for us to cut people out of our lives, we aren't naturally antagonistic and negative-seeking people, so doing something hard and upsetting can be pretty challenging. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd say that maybe you could just distance yourself? That's what I did. Stop texting as often, preoccupy yourself with things that YOU like to do, (ie, not things that you usually do with them). Maybe just don't go out with them on the weekends or get lunch with them as often. I mean, if something terrible happens, sure, I'd cut them out instantly, (I had to do so myself), but if things are just uncomfortable and making you unhappy, just gradually fade off. Be assertive in saying no. I know, it's SO HARD. I'm so bad at saying no, but I've learned a little. "Thanks but I'm going to stay in today/tonight" usually works. Don't leave room for pressure like "idk maybeeee", because then they'll keep persisting. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the most part, I want to believe that what we deserve comes to us in time, so maybe you'll find a great new group of friends just by separating yourself from this one. Good luck!!!! :) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
31	Anyone else feel like they must become famous in order to justify their own existence?	Like I feel this sub conscious pressure to become famous so I can spread positivity and encourage happiness. I feel like if I don‚Äôt become this huge influential rock star then my life has gone to waste (i‚Äôm a guitar player). All I want is for me, my family and my friends to be put in the spotlight so we can never go to waste. Idek dudes but it‚Äôs been getting to me lately. 
12	The better feeling lies in  loving what you do everyday and with that you will truly live an impactful life....\nLike by helping that kid learn guitar you are Already a rockstar. And a rockstar that helps others than spread the message TO help others.  Idk bro does that make sense. \n
5	I feel kinda the same way but I want to do it also cuz of how much I feel like I could give back to an entire fan base of people. I'm sorta working on it too but I'm content with keeping things grounded and real as much I want to be big and bright. 
4	Why must you justify your own existence?  You are not some machine, you are a subjective human being that experiences things on your own internal plane.  Your experiences are real just like the color of the sky.  Feeling you need to justify your existence to others is your Te trying to process some need that is not being met, your Te is saying you need to be effective, efficient, productive, or in your example famous and rich both in money and social connections.\n\nYou do not need to justify your own existence!\n\n------\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n^(This is comming from a person who struggles with these issues.  Whose thoughts used to be dominated by them to the point of obsession.  Who has changed but still struggles with these thoughts some of the time where some mornings or some nights they sneak up on him and hijack my mind but when I say my mind I feel tempted to change the grammar for it does not feel like my mind anymore.  Sometimes I want to escape and go away when my mind is hijacked with this NEED to be something else, this NEED to be not me.  I feel like Charles Xavier in the Days of Future Past movie where I want to run away, I want to escape...***" No... I don't want your suffering, I don't want your future!"***)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nKindness is the answer, the answer is not effectiveness but instead kindness.  Kindness, benevolence, compassion, generosity, empathetic joy for others, and once you channel these things for others you can channel these things back to yourself, to treat yourself as an other temporary till you can feel the kindness and then you reverse the position and can feel attached to your own body, for once you are kind to yourself again you can hope again. You can feel hope and find joy in this world that is a mixture of good and bad, it is a mixed kind of thing, but you also realize you can change the mixture, you can change the ratio, you can cultivate the good and the positive hope.\n\n***Be*** *BRAVE* ***enough to be Kind!***\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow what I said about me may not work for you.  What may work for you may be a different way, a different path, and a different method.  And that is okay üôÇ\n\nSurprise me!  For once you realize the world can also be kind you realize it can be full of wonder and multiple different things can exist at once simultaneously.  You say you want to be famous, well that means to me (based on the origin of the word etymologically speaking) fame means to talk, to speak, to pray, to summon (as in magic), reputation, renown, to celebrate.\n\nSurprise me, for I am listening, open, and patient. üòä
3	I feel the same dude . And sometimes I feel frustrated that things not going the way I wanted and my life is going to be wasted . I want to be  multiproffessional and famous . I want to be a doctor , a gutarist , a artist and also an dance choreographer . 
3	400000%. but not just like..vapid famous, more like, i need all the messages i convey through my music to be heard and i need to be recognized as one with them
2	Nope I don't feel that at all. In fact I wouldn't like it too much. I'd rather be helpful than famous.  I'd rather a few close friends that I love than a room full of people that I don't know who the heck they are.  I think it could be very disassociating to be famous.  People know you but never really *know* you.
2	This subconscious pressure/feeling you speak of is spot on. 
2	Yes but I do it to open more doors and opportunities to live a wackier, more fun life. Also it's like the peak of extravagance you can achieve as a human, so why not???
2	I get it. I often feel I have so much skills and creativity that would be best used to entertain people and make their lives better or distract them from their troubles. But I'm not doing that (yet) and it is frustrating. It is not about fame per se, that is just a side effect of entertaining a lot of people.
1	U mean "heard of" and high social status?
3	INTP - ENFP Relationship	What do you guys think about INTP - ENFP relationship?\n\nWe have different point of views about almost everything (sometimes perfect, sometimes not) with my boyfriend, but I would like to hear your stories about INTP's.\n\n(I am an ENFP and boyfriend is INTP)
4	my husband is intp. his way of thinking absolutely baffles me sometimes. he‚Äôs not very personally thoughtful most of the time (and he‚Äôs a horrible gift giver) but then occasionally is super sweet - granted, some of that may have been his upbringing. for the most part we make a great team.  we‚Äôve been together for 6 years and married for 3. 
2	I and my bf have very similar views. core values and lifestyle .and he can be kinda thoughtful and sweet when he is next to me. I think the relationship is healthy and great, we are both hardworking. fun. creative .sharing simlilar views .we get each other pretty fast and share similar hobbies (except he loves coding I love drawing, else one of us has new idea, the other is in it).\n\nhowever, the constant issue is he doesn't show his affection or caring much. I think its fine when he is next to me , he touches me frequently even if he doesn't show by talking . but when in long distance , we really have to be good in texts and talks , in order to have good conversation and some affections.  
2	How to deal with contradictory nature?	How does one reach a conclusion if they dispute every sub-thought along the way? üò´
5	Go outside and tare all the grass out of the ground 
2	I set a time/day when I have to make the decision. Could be 10 minutes (for something like which movie to watch) to several months/years out (for things like moving or changing jobs). When the time comes, I force myself to pick something and start moving toward my decision. I'll either feel good about it or I'll freak out because I realize it's not the way to go. Either way, I come to know what I really want. \n\nSometimes I have someone "make my decision" for me (usually silly things like what to order at a restaurant). When they say what I should get, it either sounds perfect (that is rare) or I'll almost immediately be able to identify what I ACTUALLY want. 
1	discussing the decision with other people
1	Heck if I know üòÅ I usually postpone it until something or someone else decides for me. Or delay it until I need to take a decision and then take it on the spot. The stress tho‚Äô... the stress is awful until then. But postponing and delaying might end up in me not taking a decision, so I like that.
3	Fear of public speaking/teaching?	HELLO MY BUBBLY BEAUTIFUL REDDIT FRIENDS! I need some help. I have a bit of an issue with social anxiety and thought yall would be the best equipped to help me overcome it and break out of my shell. \n\nI'm training to become a spin instructor and I LOVE IT. I have so much fun practicing and running thru new playlists on my own and I can do lights, speaking, timing etc without an issue! HOWEVER when there's someone else in the room with me, I go into derp mode and mess up and my voice cracks and I get anxious and the more I mess up the more flustered I get. It's an endless loop until complete destruction. I wanna teach asap because the studio needs me, but I can't get past this flustered effect. Any advice? I know my first few classes won't be perfect, but I'm trying to make sure I feel good about what I'm putting out! People pay for these classes and I don't wanna disappoint!\n\nTldr; I'm having serious issues doing anything in front of people. How do you get past the fear of messing up (because the fear is my only battle left to fight here) 
4	Practice\n\nPractice speaking in front of small audiences of people that you already know. Even one person. Or give a ‚Äútalk‚Äù to the mirror
2	I can imagine it feels hard to read an entire room of people when you make a mistake. Then to regain confidence with all those in the room while being watched is tough! Furthermore, first impressions are everything sometimes when you get clientele in their first experience with you! \n\nI think you are doing the right thing with lots of practice in the mirror and having a profession that you are passionate about! Its way easier for anyone who is well practiced and passionate to speak about their craft :)\n\nThe point there is I can totally relate! When I am presenting a powerpoint in front of a room full of executives I get that same nervous feeling and sometimes ‚Äòmess up‚Äô in my eyes.  I‚Äôve learned to be able to laugh at myself and make a joke at my own expense (even if I need to practice that joke). Even addressing nervousness in the crowd before you begin can help to harness the nervousness. You‚Äôll feel more connected to them and them to you just by sharing a common human emotion. There have to be some others that might be just as nervous as you! I know i‚Äôd be nervous in my first spin class :) \n\nAll the best to you!
1	Agh. I've been practicing for months. I used to throw up every time but after 4 months now I just uncontrollably shake like a tiny wet dog that got left out in the freezing cold. Idk what to do 
4	My boss told me to stop being passionate about too many things.	I am a recent grad working for an online retail start-up. Part of the reason I am working at a start-up is because I thought it would mean working on multiple projects at a time. Although this is indeed the case, the guy that hired me sat me down today and told me that I needed to learn to focus and complete one project at a time. This makes complete sense. He said that the sense of achievement that I will gain from mastering a single area is incredibly satisfying. I don't disagree with him one bit... But why is this such a painful thing to accept for me? It seems that as soon as the project passes the ideation phase, and it comes down to actual execution, I become overwhelmed and start to feel completely incompetent. How can I overcome this? Especially in a non-collaborative environment? What is the best practice for an ENFP to follow through on independent projects? I really want to overcome these fears and anxieties and gain credibility for being able to see a project through magnificently from start to finish. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few more questions- Is me not thriving in execution phases of projects a problem? Or does it mean I must find an occupation where just brainstorming is enough lol? Or is it that I need to go through jobs like these ones to ultimately land a job in an environment I will thrive in? Should I feel stifled by what my boss said? What's the best way to look at this situation?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny tips/opinions/thoughts appreciated. Thank you!
7	My opinion is it's a really good skill to have to finish what you start. The thing is, finishing a project isn't as fun to us. But you have to remember that dedication is better than motivation/inspiration. I could sit in my room all day with ideas but that doesn't make me feel better nor does it help me achieve anything if I never finish what I start. It could just be a thing we all have to learn. It's not that it's our weakness, it's just not our strength. It's a strength that you can build, and if you build it you'll be unstoppable.
5	It's a classic ENFP move to be super excited during the start up phase of an idea and then to lose focus as soon as the monotony of actually seeing the task through sets in. You're not incompetent, you're just bored and that's fine! However, due to the requirements of your job, it's probably best to see these sorts of things through. As you work hard at staying the course, pushing through the boredom and finishing things, the easier this practice will become!\n\nDon't get yourself down, you're just ready to move onto the next thing before this one is done. 
2	It‚Äôs really important to be authentic in order to be a healthy ENFP. ‚ÄúStop being passionate about many things‚Äù is horrible advice imo. 
1	I think all ENFP's get this. It is so fun to play with ideas but actually doing things can seem a bore. But you can get better at it by developing your Te. Try doing puzzles in your free time more. Not just jigsaw puzzles but like word problems, visual puzzles, organization puzzles. Try to boost your efficiency and your drive to get things done and organized in the best way. Organize your house or apartment, your closet. Really get into that mode and you may find the enjoyment of getting something done, and done the right way.
66	sunday night feels	i wanna drink wine and dance in italian streets and i wanna twirl and twirl in sundresses until my heart feels full and my head feels a lil dizzy and i wanna lay on the ground and feel the grass kiss my back and i wanna fall in love with the way that my body moves to the lyrics of all the right songs and i want to look into the future and create this life where i want to get up everyday and live and do i mean really live!!! like shouting from the rooftops about lovers that i was never really in love with and about the love i have in my heart right this very second, i wanna shout and not be afraid of my own voice and the sounds it makes throughout all of my transitions; like fuck i‚Äôm really bad with transitions, i wanna shout about how life can be so tricky but also about how beautiful he is when he‚Äôs sleepy and mumbling¬†and how sometimes i struggle to breathe when he tells me he is in love with me; because how could someone love someone who‚Äôs got all these emotions, i wanna shout about all the things i have done wrong but i wanna tell the world that somehow i will make them right, i wanna shout about all the good i‚Äôve seen and the happiness i‚Äôve felt and about all the people who have touched my life and made me a better person just by knowing them,¬†i wanna shout and i don‚Äôt want to be quiet, i wanna shout and scream and laugh and love. this life was made to be mine, i‚Äôm not going to apologize anymore.¬†
21	I feel like a spy coming over to this sub (I'm an INFJ) but damn I just love you guys. You *are* life.\n\nAnd you specifically, OP, write really well.
8	Oh wow, I love it!  Thank you for sharing this!
8	This is incredible. A poem from the internet that I will read out loud to my boyfriend. I will attempt to take credit although I‚Äôll tell the truth when he asks, but he will agree that he heard me in all of these words too. 
6	Dude I'm from INTP and I feel the same way. You're good at conveying emotion. 
6	>  my body moves to the lyrics of all the right songs \n\nThis is SUCH A POWERFUL sentence, I loved this post. Thank you.  \nI wish I could see you one day dancing in our streets here in Italy, I'll be the one who will shout "YOU GO GIRL" from the window!  \n
4	I wanna put this to music\n\nLet's make a song
4	Beautiful! I felt every word like it were my own ‚ù§Ô∏è
3	Love this!
3	Did not expect to be this impressed on Reddit. Wow. 
3	Oh I love it!!!!!
2	Nice writing! 
2	Sunday night feels throughout.
1	beautiful
3	New to reddit	Hello my fellow reddit users, I'm an enfp too and trying to settle down in a community and learn more about this site. 
3	GOD I LOVE THIS SITE XD
2	E P I C. G A M E R. M O M E N T. 
1	Hey fellow ENFP, welcome to the club. Welcome!
1	Hellooooo wanna be freely weird? 
1	HiiiiIi! welcome! I don't have any ENFP friends or know any ENFPs in my life so this is sort of my safe haven.  We all love to chat and talk about literally anything and everything, so I assure you, it's fun!
1	YYYAAAAAAAAAY!!!
142	Do any other ENFPs deal with an incredibly intense need to feel loved/liked? If so, how do you handle this?	I have a very deep-rooted need to feel loved. I know I am loved as a fact, but feeling it as an emotion is super, super important for me. My main love language is words of affirmation, and lately I've been frustrated by my need for affirmation in order to feel the love I know my friends have for me. I experience emotion deeply, and also struggle with anxiety and depression, so this doesn't help. \n\n\nI try to cope by reminding myself that people do love me and how they've shown me this, but sometimes the negative thoughts are extremely loud. Sometimes it's hard to love myself well because of this, and not only see the negative aspects of myself.\n\nDo any other ENFPs deal with this? If so, how do you cope?
71	I don‚Äôt struggle so much with my need to be liked, but I can‚Äôt stand being disliked.  My mind will obsess over it, and I‚Äôll keep trying to think of how I can at least get the person to neutral.
42	Yes, 100%. Struggling with anxiety and depression too. I feel like as an ENFP that‚Äôs really common... makes me sad to see all my fellow people suffering like this. \nI‚Äôve started going to therapy so hopefully that‚Äôll help. I‚Äôm still too early in the process to see any results but I really hope it‚Äôll work. \n\nHang in there and know you‚Äôre not alone! :) 
38	I don‚Äôt usually care if people like me or not... until they don‚Äôt. Then I‚Äôm on a mission to win them over. Like... I‚Äôm a mother fucking delight... who the hell doesn‚Äôt like meeee?! 
19	I get this. I also tend to notice when other people are sad or down and then when I‚Äôm not myself and kinda depressed it feels like no one notices. Even if the roles were reversed, I would notice and say something to them. I just wish people treated me the same way I treat them
12	I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve felt more related to before by another ENFP. I struggle with anxiety/depression/BP2 and the constant reassurance that I‚Äôm loved/liked is almost necessary üò±
11	Yes. I just keep in relationship to my values, as an ENFP, and keep trying to go forward in this life, trying to meet good, interesting, genuine people, who can love me, give me affection, etc., even though everyone I've ever met is an asshole pretty much, a predator, shitty friend, etc.
7	I do have the deep desire to feel loved by people I care about, and my first love language is words of affirmation too!  I don't care too much if I'm liked by people I don't know though.\n\nJust be yourself and if someone isn't drawn to you let them go, you'll have fewer relationships maybe but definitely better ones
7	I‚Äôve learned the only way to help this is to develop my authenticity ie secondary function -introverted feeling. You gotta let yourself be yourself so people can actually love you for you. Robin Williams struggled with this a lot. Sometimes we put on a show or performance don‚Äôt let people get to know the true us. 
5	I have found that experiencing love, actually feeling loved, was something I subconsciously avoided. The vulnerability it caused me also caused trapped emotions to surface. those really sucked but my mind seriously thought if I felt them for one second, that I was going die. \n\nso with this, means there is a void to be filled, since the love from others was rejected, I had to find other means of finding value, such as having everybody like me, such as having a hot girl friend, such as being the best at video games, best at the piano, blah, blah\n\nbut I am better now, I found that receiving love and value for self is an going process but at least I am on the right path now. \n\nbut yeah, I had to deal with trapped emotions, 10 to 15min intense feelings of emotional pain(aka emotional processing), had to spend time getting to know myself, and lots of personal affirmations
3	I cannot wait till I get to go home to someone every day
3	Honestly, give up and make yourself into someone YOU love. You will go crazy trying to make people like you. I tried to kill myself when I was 16 because I realized I could never do it. Over time I developed into the person who fit my goals and my ideals and that has brought me so much more happiness and stability. Figure out what YOU like in people. What YOU think is important. Then become that. Meeting your own goals is the only way to happiness. You can‚Äôt control what others think. You can control what you do and what standards you have for yourself. 
3	I totally relate as an ENFP whose first love language is also words of affirmation. I used to be a lot worse but this past year I was in a bad social situation and only had myself as a friend and I grew a lot from that experience and now whenever I'm feeling down, I'm able to build myself back up again by reminding myself with my own words of affirmation why I'm amazing. My heart still bursts when people express their love for me verbally and I do often crave that validation but I must say, I think I'm in a much healthier place after having spent so much time alone and learning to love myself üòä
6	Yes ENFPs deal with this.  I have thoughts for INTJ deal with this also, so I am similar but also different in an ***alien way***.  6 other types also deal with this (for a total of 8 types.). \n\nNow the other 8 types also deal with this (for a total of 16, 8+8) but they deal with ***other problems / trials / tribulations first*** and this need to be loved occupies their thoughts but other occupations may have primacy / presence while this need is not entirely absent it is just lower on the hierarchy for other needs shove to the front of the line of their conscious thoughts.\n\nI will share more later, it is theory it takes up space, furthermore it is more fun / joyous to listen to others where they share their Does Any One Else experience this stories üòÅü§©üòçüòé
5	Yeah 100%, I hate it. Even when I don't even like the person I need them to like me. This is basically why I've occasionally really bad breakdowns.
2	Did I write this?
2	Yes, I'm basically Michael Scott.
2	Not me, I have cultivated a core of good friends from which I get the love and appreciation I need. But my family was extremely loving and supporting, so maybe it‚Äôs easy for me.\n\nI think this fades away with becoming more mature and secure, so maybe work in that direction :)
2	I have the same question myself. I really want to be appreciated for the things I do. But at the same time, I tell myself to just do things without any praise because ... well, why not? Being nice isn't wrong. Then again I just feel underappreciated ...
2	If I wrote post about this feeling in myself, I would name it "being an attention whore" or something. However, your wording may be more correct. For example, while at one period in life, due to spending excessive time on dating websites, I was promiscuous and polyamorous and what not, but I never felt really loved by anyone. I felt wanted, which is not the same as loved. Ever heard biblical tale about just king deciding which of two is a mother of the kid? One "loved" it so much, she agreed that the kid will be split in two using an axe or a saw, so she has her part. Another woman, one that truly loved the kid, would tell that "please no, give the kid to other woman but don't kill it". That one loved truly. \n\nOf course, having attention, people talking to you, people messaging you, people liking you (and your posts, duh!) is an addictive and good thing. And I wouldn't say being loved is better, because it's NOT an upgrade of being wanted. This is totally different state and different emotion.

1	I had this problem, but turned out it was mainly mentall illness (bpd). Focusing on myself 24/7 and going to therapy helped a lot.
1	For me I used to be uper obnoious to be around because it always had to be about me, I had to say something, do something and be part of everything.  \nAfter some heavy backlash/rejections it turned to the complete opposite for a while where I wouldn't go out at all apart from going to school.  \nNowadays I feel like I found a decent balance of the two (the reclusive part might be my inferior Si? It's this feeling of just wanting to do my own thing sometimes)
1	I kinda used to. Honestly i ended up finding awesome friends who've helped me out a lot. 
2	Romantic novel recommendations??	Hi!\n\nAny recommendation for a funny romantic novel to read?? I usually prefer contemporary novels with a lot of humor that can keep me entertained. \n\nI would really appreciate any suggestions!! \n\nThx in advance!     
5	PRIDE AND PREJUDICE! (it's hella romantic and it made me laugh a lot, Elizabeth and Mr Darcy are both really funny in lots of parts) 
3	Jane Eyre\n\n&#x200B;
2	Have you ever read Terry pratchett? Not so romantic but very funny. Neil Gaiman's _Stardust_ is romantic and funny too. 
2	Well, I have several but in all of them, the humor eventually drains and drama ensues. So would you be game?
2	Uh, you‚Äôre in for a treat! Try David Lodge. You should start with The Campus Trilogy. I know it says it‚Äôs university-related but read each book‚Äôs synopsis and you‚Äôll see it‚Äôs also relationship-related. Also, another book by him: Secret Thoughts.\n\nPS: Don‚Äôt forget to come back and let me know if you liked his books!
5	What would your predictions be on an ENFP/ISFP relationship?	
3	My sisters and mom are all ISFPs. I think there is great compatibility potential when the ENFP learns to focus on the "now" and the ISFP understands the importance of abstract ideas. When I was younger, my sisters and I would always argue, and my mom wouldn't want to pitch in because she doesn't like dealing with conflict. Over the years, I learned how to appreciate my sisters' views. Now we are all close to each other! üòä
2	My girlfriend is self typed as an infp but I think she's more of an isfp.\n\nI'd intuitively understand an infp but an isfp requires me to bridge the communication gap.\n\nI like how she's very different from me. The Fi Dom of an isfp is way more reactive than an infp. She's like a passionate flame seeking experiences. It speaks to my Ne and Fi and shows what a strong Fi Dom is.\n\nThat being said, when she's uncertain about things, she acts rashly in ways I don't necessarily understand.\n\n
1	u/proxyone13, I‚Äôm so bad at remembering what Ni etc. stands for. Can you help me out? 
1	GETTING HITCHED. 
19	Do you keep your feelings very private?	Hello fellow ENFPs.  Are any of you very private about revealing your innermost feelings?  What I mean is - if anyone at all were to come to me crying or hurt, I wouldn‚Äôt judge them at all for it and would feel sad with them and want them to feel better.  I would probably offer them a hug and talk to them and give them something to cheer them up or let them know that I cared.  I wouldn‚Äôt leave until I knew they were ok.  Obviously for my friends, but I would even do the same for a stranger.  People seem to reveal very personal things to me, even people I don‚Äôt have a deep relationship with.  I don‚Äôt mind.  I love helping people and want them to be happy and loved.  \n\nHowever, when it comes to my own feelings, I am very guarded and almost never share them.  I have to feel very close to a person in order to open up in that way.  I abhore crying in front of people.  Honestly if I cry in front of someone, they should take it as a compliment that I feel that comfortable with them.  I never say I love you to anyone but my family.  I gave someone a book with a very heartfelt inscription on it last year.  I have never done that before.  It felt like a huge risk, and I almost didn‚Äôt do it.  People tend to think I‚Äôm a very happy and silly person, but I don‚Äôt often share this side of myself.  I feel extremely deeply, but it is very rare for me to share it unless it is with a person I deeply trust.\n\nDo any of you have this problem or experience?  I wish I were not like this and could let people in more easily.  I think I am very sensitive and don‚Äôt want to get hurt.  I had bad friendship experiences growing up, so I‚Äôm sure that plays a part in it, but I wonder if it has to do with our temperament as well.  This is another reason that I was confused about testing as an extravert.  I am such a private person in this regard, although otherwise I might seem like an open book.
11	I wouldn't say VERY private, but I do restrain myself a bit in regard to that. 
6	I use to but I've been working on being more vulnerable with people. I will share feelings I've had in the past with people in order to relate to what they are going through but if it is something I am currently dealing with it takes some extra work to get it out of me. I don't intentionally try to be a private person, I just get uncomfortable when people can "see" me...(my therapist is putting in work in 2019 lol)
3	I used to be, until I realized how good it feels, and how helpful it is. 
3	This is so me. I‚Äôm in a relationship now though with someone I feel comfortable with and can trust and I‚Äôm not at the point of crying in front of everyone but I have given myself a space to cry by myself and let things out so that I can hold space and eventually be able to be that open and vulnerable with others 
3	ENFP survival Guide by Heidi Preibe talks about this struggle too, it is a very good book, only like 5.00 bucks for ebook, and if anything a great reference guide
2	Yes, I don't share my most intimate feelings with barely anyone and if I choose to tell a secret or my deep feelings it's a rare occasion and if they don't seem to care or be invested like I hoped I'll downplay it and act like it's not a biggie. It even feels weird discussing it like this to a stranger lol.\n\n That's how "Fi" works I guess? It's our own feelings that we cultivate inside, our inner world. It can be seen as selfish for different reasons by others. 
2	Not private ... at all. I can‚Äôt help but express my feelings every chance I get. It‚Äôs like a physical need. 
2	I 100% relate. I do think a part of it is the experiences we had growing up. I am a lifeline for many people but I have a hard time letting people into the very personal feelings of my own heart. 
2	Yup I'm exactly the same. I have a couple of friends who I'm happy to talk about my feelings to. The rest I feel don't know me well enough to understand without me explaining at length and feeling like I'm boring them. Despite that I'm very happy to listen to other peoples' emotions and comfort them.\n\nI think it's something to do with a desire for self sufficiency with my emotions. I've needed to be self sufficient at times and so I think they've reached a stage of being slightly incommunicable, and I'm not really used to doing so anyway.
2	I both do and do not share my feelings, generally I‚Äôm completely closed with regards to my feelings, but with a select few, I offer insight in the form of cryptic statements. Because I both do and do not want to let people in.
2	I am the same way man. I am an open person but that does not mean I will open my real thoughts and feelings.\n\nEspecially after others have taken advantage of my vulnerability in the past.\n I am the shy extrovert. Also being alone you still use Ne all the time, samething with INFJ, ISFJ, etc, they are always using their Ni or Si even being around people, that is why they get drained being around them. \nENFPs still love to be around others, if even people are just talking around them and not to them, because they still gives something for Ne to play with that is beyond their own thoughts 
1	I keep a lot buried deep. I just recently bore my soul to someone and it was terrifying.... Mainly leading up to it. I knew the person would understand though, and it turned out to be an amazing conversation. \n\nThat being said, I think people don't reciprocate as fully as I prefer... Because I don't know how to explain things clearly and I always worry that people won't understand or will misinterpret what I'm trying to say... So it has to be someone who I feel is really engaged and willing to put in the work to really understand where I am coming from. They don't have to agree with me, but I don't open up unless I think the person try and show some sort of empathy. \n\nFor most people, most of the time, I feel like they wouldn't understand or would be apathetic to my  feelings, which would be the WORST. I'd rather them just not know how I feel.
1	Yes & no. When it comes to positive feelings, I open-heartedly express them to others but I keep any negative feelings deep inside and rarely open up to anyone about them unless it is someone who have gained my full trust shows genuine interest, love, and empathy. But even with them, I don't open up 100%. It's just hard to open up to anyone about my deepest feelings, mostly out if fear and rejection. I would give off subtle hints here and there, but have rarely been direct about it. It's something I've been trying to improve recently but keep finding myself back to square one whenever I sense judgement or lack of reaction/empathy/affirmation from whoever I open up to. 
1	You hit it on the nail. I am absolutely the same way. I love taking care of people and am absolutely judgement free about whatever I hear or see. This could be because it makes me feel trusted for someone to share their emotions and feelings and vulnerability with me. I strive to be someone who is trustworthy, so I relate back to what I hear by talking about how I‚Äôve felt and dealt with the situation, hoping to provide advice and encouragement. \n\nWhen it comes to sharing my own inner feelings, I really need to trust that person and that takes time. It‚Äôs almost as if I don‚Äôt want to be known, but I want to know what makes others tick and I can usually make very accurate guesses regarding personality and preferences. I feel like I present different parts of myself with each person I meet and I am working on integrating everything. \n\nIt‚Äôs a process of trusting your closest friends to have the best intentions for you and believing it. It‚Äôs hard when you feel like you‚Äôve had to rely on yourself for so long and are also knowledgeable about all the different ways in which you could improve your situation.. so it actually is more helpful for someone to simply sit in the silence with me when words cannot encompass the swirl of chaotic emotions storming within. 
1	I find it impossible to be private ! 
1	Science careers	My wife recently took the MBTI and typed as ENFP multiple times. She's currently a biology post-doc researcher and although she's passionate about biology, she feels she's lost interest in academia.  Reading the description of the ENFP seems to have also reinforced a notion that she needs to pick a science career where she works with people in a face to face capacity.\n\nAre there any ENFPs in science happy with such a career, and if so, could you share some details. She's seriously considering becoming a **field scientist** at a company instead of academia. Thanks.
1	Although I ended up not going in that direction right out of high school I always wanted to become a Marine Biologist! I may do this in the future. I became a Tech Analyst instead. I saw it as a challenge and curiosity and found I had a talent for analysis. I realized that the research could be a lonely job but, getting to present and collaborate my findings with other analysts was VERY rewarding. It was the intellectual stimulation I needed and with other like-minded individuals that made the job rewarding. \n\nThe point I came to ultimately is that it really only matters that my passions are bettering humanity in some way; directly or indirectly.\n\nScience rules!
114	Long time depression and being ENFP.	I've been depressed for awhile now due to personal reasons that I don't really feel like disclosing online. \n\nIt really saps the life out of me, I haven't felt myself for a long time. I was the most ENFP person possible and now i'm just... a husk of my former self. I show flashes of being myself at times, especially at parties, I tend to be a complete social butterfly. But most of the time i'm a cranky fucker who is trying to get my life figured out. I hope 2019 I redeem myself and become a better person. It's hard to not be cynical and jaded in times like this but i'm trying my best\n\njust a small rant i guess, ignore me 
60	Step for step guide to get out of depression\n\nGet out of bed (at the same time and before noon). Make your bed. Eat. Try sports (motivation booster). Cold shower (motivation booster). Do the dishes. Don't listen to sad music. Maybe do something useful or work against isolation (contact friends). Eat. Sleep. Repeat. \n\nAvoid hunger, anger, loneliness, tiredness.
30	This is deadass the most I've EVER related to another ENFP. I do hope you get to return to a more positive version of yourself, but until then thanks for being a salty curmudgeon with me.
16	I was the same.\n\nGive yourself permission to be your true self.  \n\nDon't seek permission from anyone else.\n\nWho cares what other people think you should be.  THAT'S THEIR PROBLEM.\n\nIt helps me a lot. \n\nMeditate.\n\nBe YOU.
10	same boat.  it ebbs and flows.  \n\nrest well, stay hydrated (i think it does a lot, curiously) and know that things are often not as bad as they seem.  This is my credo.  it does me ok.
10	Our energy is  porous. \n\nIs there anyone you‚Äôre around that makes you feel worse?  IE: BFFs, moms (notoriously known for this)\n\n\nReduce spending time with them. Negative energy is probably from someone you love.  \nYou can love someone and not internalize their lifestyle or problems. \n\nNow that you have space, fill it with JOY. \n\nBreathe. Honor your blessings by using them. Honor yourself by taking the best care of yourself. \n\nYou‚Äôre fucking awesome. There‚Äôs nothing you need to DO to be awesome. You are awesome. \nJust like a lion is awesome cuz it‚Äôs a lion.\n\n\nYou are brilliant and beautiful. \nHonor your greatness and fill your life with joy. \n\n\n\n
5	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO1mTELoj6o \n\nWatch this, it literally changed my life for the better, I still watch it from time to time when I feel down and I'm trying to figure out what the source of my sadness/self-loathing is \n
3	Take your time. In the true sense of it and in everything.
3	I am feeling that you are struggling with what I am dealing with. How nothing goes as you imagined it and all the events in your life are connecting completely out of place and out of sync from what your intuition was telling you. And now it has to come to accepting that your imagination and your intuition will always be turned up upside down from practical matters and common sense and now life is so disappointing having to accept all of this? Arggghh
2	I'm happy that you keep on going :)\n\nMy diagnosis is bipolar. But recently I have been thinking about this idea. It is possible to be depressed and happy, just like it's possible to have good mood and be unhappy.\n\nIt's a weird thought but it really helps me stay optimistic. Of course it might just be the nature of my illness, because my mood is very chaotic.\n\nIt's up to you to decide if you agree with it or not.
2	Hey man I'm in the exact same boat at the moment. I don't feel like myself at all and I haven't for a long while now. \n\nI'm working on getting back to me.\n\nI reckon we can get through this buddy. I believe in you. 
2	Absolutely. I'm a grumpy old homebody now. I used to be like this magical life of the party full of curiosity, and whenever I'm happy that comes back, but rn I suck. Just give yourself as much time as you need to get back.
2	I can relate. This year has been really tough for me because so much shit happened in my personal life and with my career. I am doing a hell of a lot better than I used to, but I still feel cranky as fuck some days, so much so that it really bothers me how much I get pissed off at other people. I never used to get THAT mad at people, but now I can't stand socializing for extended periods of time. I miss the old me...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis winter doesn't help, with the lack of sun and all. I live in a northern climate and I just bought a light therapy lamp that I try use every morning and sometimes after work. It definitely supports my mood.\n\n&#x200B;
2	I relate to you on this as a fellow ENFP
1	https://youtu.be/Lb3PzxwEKCQ Give this guy a whirl, it helped me to realize a lot about myself . It should show you a new perspective about depression . Hope you find happiness again friend. :)
1	You need to talk to someone friend. 
1	I feel like my depression has formed me into an ENFP, at least to an extent
1	I am in the same boat. Crazy life situation knocked me out. Now my habits and life are in a funk. \n\nHere's what I've learned. \n\n1. It's okay to feel what you do. We as ENFPs need time to process (Fi). Set aside some time everyday to just feel your emotions. It's okay to be sad and emotional. \n\n2. Your habits probably got out of funk. Part of my depression and lack of movement in life is that I have no routine. Routine, while seemingly not an ENFP trait, is actually necessary for us to thrive. \n\nFor example: wake up and sleep at the same time every day. Eat healthy. Meditate every morning. Read your goals each morning. Workout every morning. \n\nRead "miracle morning the book." It teaches a lot about the optimal morning. \n\n3. Set realistic, achievable goals!\n\nHere's to both of us getting out of this funk. Good luck!
1	This is how i feel right now but i feel like an outsider also i dont even know if im enfp
1	Hey, are you getting help? Medication? \n\nI'm ENFP and also have Severe Anxiety and Chronic Depression. Just because you're ENFP doesn't mean you can't be Depressed. I've been fighting mine a long, long time. All ENFP means is that you fight yours a little differently than somebody with a different personality type, not that you're immune. If it weren't for my meds and therapy, not to mention my support system, I'd have lost my battle a long time ago. \n\nPM me if you want. 
1	Do one thing consistently everyday. It can be reading a book, practice some type of art for an hour everyday. For me it was writing diary. Whenever I noticed myself falling back into depression, I had already stopped my daily streak. 
1	Just here to say, as a fellow ENFP, that ENFPs give great advice. Love y‚Äôall! 
1	I need to say, this is exactly how i am right now. I have battled clinical major depression for many years. After recovering from it i decided to work on expanding my social life ( i was pretty much a recluse for 8 years in a toxic relationship while working on a startup). When expanding my social life, I went from 0 to 100 very quickly, being every where, making many friends, having a great time. I became known to everyone as a social butterfly - perhaps it is something that comes naturally to me without even realising it. I think i got addicted to that, as well as the alcohol to keep it going. It was only recently that i found myself not being able to create or hold on to a meaningful romantic relationship that my emotions crashed again, my depression, anxiety and general sense of worthlessness came back - i started back on anti depressants again.\n\nWhat am doing this year - i have started on Dry January, no alcohol so far and it has been kind to my health, mental well being and wallet. I am working on creating more meaningful strong relationships with people, rather than just superficial ones. I am still going to be a very social person, I love it, and people do love me for it, i will just need to be very aware of what I am doing and why.
1	I‚Äôve also been in a rough patch lately. Normally I always have something to add to the conversation but lately I don‚Äôt have the energy to even say a few words. Hang in there <3
1	I understand. Ive been chronically ill for six years now and it has destroyed me. 
1	I just got myself out of a depression that lasted over a year. The MAJOR game changer was changing my mental track. I had to remember to think positively, how to see the good along with the bad. For every bad thought, I thought of the opposite. "I've put on so much weight, I'll be fat for the rest of my life!" Nope nope nope "You have put so much work into learning how to eat healthy and be healthy, put it to use!"\n\nHealthy habits and lifestyle is major! Someone said get up at the same time every day, before noon! That's a great start. I'm 6am Mon-Fri and 8am on the weekends. Make your bed, brush your teeth, drink some water, and eat something easy and healthy every morning. Scrambled eggs, oatmeal, yogurt, a smoothie. Just have a morning routine.\n\nTake care of your appearance. Call friends, make new ones- people on Tindr are actually doing that! Go for walks or do sports or work out. \n\nMake goals directly in relation to the things that are upsetting you in life and work out a game plan.\n\nIt is a lot but just work at it every day. Keep making small steps and you will be on your journey. 
1	I'm with you. I've been going through major depression and complex grief issues after losing my mom due to an illness about about a year ago. Depression has been changing me into someone else. I used to be a go-getter in life who was self-confident, very optimistic, ambitious, and energetic about everything. Used to smile at everyone and had many days where I would wake up feeling happy and have thirst for life. I had big dreams and goals and worked hard towards them. I used to have a lot of friends and was well liked by others. \n\nBut depression and grief took away all of my self-confidence, self-esteem, and the sense of control in life. My mind spirals into the dark nearly everyday and I'm too tired and sad to function. I've become pessimistic, apathetic, bitter, and lonely. It's hard to genuinely smile and feel happy anymore. Most of friends who I confided in walked out of my life once I opened up to them about my darkest feelings. And I often feel like I'm being overly clingy/needy, too sensitive, annoying and burdensome to the few real friends who stayed and keep fearing that they will eventually leave me too. I feel pathetic, unlovable, and undesirable and life feels meaningless and empty. There are many days where I just want to give up and be done with everything. Depression is truly exhausting and soul-sucking. There's nothing more I want than to somehow turn my life around and get out of this rock bottom. \n\nI've recently made the decision to seek out professional help, hoping that it will help me find some direction in life and help find myself again. I hope you will do so too, and wish you the best on your journey. Remember that you're not alone on this battle, and keep fighting. Good luck and best wishes. 
1	I feel you bro. been there myself these past 6 months (intense break up). I'm getting out of it now. What really gets me going is knowing how much I am loved and admired by certain people I love and respect. I know that I can do ANYTHING if I set my mind and attitude in check. I think it's safe to say that ENFPs fantasize a lot, so I fantasize about what I'll be like or doing in the future (and stop myself when I fatasize if the one that got away). Try to listen to some hype music (saw someone mention it in the comments). I know I absolutely LOVE depressing music (specifically sad love sings) but now I'm avoiding them I until i know I feel nothing when I hear them. Listen to "Los Amigos Invisibles", just a recommendation (idk if it's your taste or if you'll get into Spanish music... but damn these guys make me want to wild out every time I hear them üëåüëåüëå) \nMy blessings to you and I hope you get better ‚ô•Ô∏è
1	Saaaame. 
1	Have you been taking care of others more than yourself ?  :(   \n\nThis was the only thing that made me real sad. Like not-leave-the-house-or-get-out-of-bed sad. Flying-of-the-handle-at-the-ones-I-loved sad; only to make me hate myself more. No one was returning the favor and I was running on empty all the time. I would try to feel better but, it was never enough.\n\nIt was no ones fault. I just lost sight of my self-worth. You are still you, still vivacious. I was just feeling mentally under-the-weather. \n\nIt took time and self-care. Lots of it :)\n\nI took myself on many dates! Things that you remember that made you feel most alive make great medicine for your mind. \n\nAll the best!
-3	Depression is a lie as is everything you know. All is one single process, vast as the the universe and beyond. If your brain wants to "fit in and conform" to the "next major narrative" then that is perfectly understandable.\n\nMost people hide the painful emotions even from themselves, and those who do not and who are more sensitive later on are passed off as "defective" and have to be "treated".\n\nWe get "depressed" and "excited" for the same reason people with similar first names have more chances to marry. There is a trivial meaning behind it but the brain cannot consciously access it.\n\nSell noitcaer, erom noitcani.
5	Motivational Monday!	\nToday is a new day! A fresh week! An opportunity start something new and get back into life. \n\nWhat inspires you, /r/ENFP?\n\nPost stories, quotes, and images that give you life. Need a little rally? Don't be shy posting your goals; let /r/ENFP give you a pep talk!\n
1	Hardship inspires me. A devastating breakup, a huge life change that turns my world around, all of these things have broken me before, for a time. But they also have always seemed to inspire me to turn the negativity into positive outcomes. They force me to alter my views of the world, to take on new perspectives, to reevaluate myself. It's not always easy through this process to stay positive, but everytime I go through something hard, I think I come out wiser and stronger and happier with my growth and self understanding. \n\nI experience depression and sadness on and off, but I'm so proud of how my need for positivity always wins out in the end :) 
5	ENFP thing or just me?	I have this weird thing that happens every now and then, especially since I‚Äôve gotten older.  I‚Äôm wondering if it happens to other ENFPs or just me.  It‚Äôs very hard to explain, but sometimes when I‚Äôm talking to someone (about any ol‚Äô subject), I begin to have an outer-body experience.  I start to hear myself talking and it‚Äôs like I temporarily become a complete stranger to myself, my voice, and what I‚Äôm taking about.  It feels super uncomfortable but lasts no more than a minute.  It‚Äôs like my body goes on autopilot while I watch myself from a different perspective.   Yikes... as I type this, I‚Äôm realizing just how weird this really is.  Only happens a few times a year, but it‚Äôs the strangest experience.  Does ANYbody else have this?
6	That's not a usual ENFP thing. You maybe having a Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder.\n\n" Depersonalization disorder is marked by periods of feeling disconnected or detached from one's body and thoughts (depersonalization). The disorder is sometimes described as feeling like you are observing yourself from outside your body or like being in a dream. However, people with this disorder do not lose contact with reality; they realize that things are not as they appear. An episode of depersonalization can last anywhere from a few minutes to (rarely) many years."[https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/depersonalization-disorder-mental-health#1](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/depersonalization-disorder-mental-health#1)\n\nPlease consult a doctor for this. I hope this helps.
3	This sounds like a potential mental health issue rather than MBTI (altho I‚Äôm *certainly no doctor*)\n\nIt reminds me of what I‚Äôve read of [depersonalization](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dissociative-disorders/symptoms-causes/syc-20355215), especially the body on autopilot, watching self from different perspective, becoming a complete stranger to self and out of body experience\n\nIt wouldn‚Äôt hurt to talk to your doctor about it
2	Dude, this happened to me when I moved to a new country to study, the first couple of MONTHS I felt like this, the experience was so surreal I couldn't believe I had accomplished this thing, I had work so hard to get there, the first couple of months I was just trying to adjust and organize my thoughts and feelings.\nI spent so much time in my head that I felt like my body just roamed and went here and there and I watched it come and go. I slowly came back to feeling like myself and entering my body after I started to make great friends and adapted to the new environment.\nSo yeah maybe we are both weird
2	Probably not the same thing but if I get the last word in or say something and it‚Äôs quiet, it will echo in my head repeatedly and sound super weird and not like me 
2	It‚Äôs called dissociating. It has nothing to do with your MBTI type. It‚Äôs a symptom of a potential mental health disorder like anxiety. I dissociate frequently when my mental health is out of wack. Find some coping tools for anxiety. 
2	This happens to me! Though not as often anymore. I noticed it was more when I was in sensory overload (lots of people, loud music, etc.) I always enjoyed the feeling, actually. 
3	ENFPs, what obscure song/genre do you love but are too scared to show friends?	Let us hear it! The weirder the better :)\n\n**Also send links**
7	I have a massive obsession with Electro-swing. Nobody else I know finds it interesting at all. I love it so much, I dance to it in the evenings in my pajamas a lot.\n\n[Caravan Palace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBGSJ3sbivI)\n\n[Parov Stelar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twqM56f_cVo)\n\n[Yolanda Be Cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAOPIvBoxa8)
5	I like apocalyptic Christian hip hop. haha. Like this: https://youtu.be/tFyXm-HfYBU
3	The bands "infant annihilator" and "anaal nathrakh", but I'm more afraid that even though they all now I'm a metalhead I do sometimes enjoy pop and happy shit like ariana grande, Disney songs and romantic 80s ballads haha
2	Music from the movie Baby Driver
2	I don't have any friends. But I will say Taylor Swift? Love her and not ashamed. (I'm a guy)
2	I listen to a lot of rock and usually hate music on the radio. I still never hide my guilty pleasures like Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift or Harry Styles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut the one song I think I'll never be able to share with my friends is Micro Cuts from Muse.\n\nTook me a while before I liked the song myself, but now it's my ultimate workout/ running song.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y31WAq4cENo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y31WAq4cENo)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess you made this post so you could also share your own obscene music. So what is your obscure song/genre?\n\n&#x200B;
2	[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85fVsUylk5I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85fVsUylk5I) \-  Ashley Monroe - "Hands On You" \n\n# [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsfDpW7PYN8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsfDpW7PYN8) - Morgan Wallen Covers Jason Isbell's 'Cover Me Up'  (I am going to get some of these lyrics tatted on me)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkPrXL-H5Qc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkPrXL-H5Qc) \- Florence + the Machine: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrR\_gm6RqCo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrR_gm6RqCo) \-  Mac Miller: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert (I love the song 2009)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8a2EosJIbM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8a2EosJIbM) \- Hobo Johnson and The Lovemakers: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert (Creve Couer is my favorite on this one)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcuMd\_N7mmA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcuMd_N7mmA) \-  Excision & Illenium - Gold (Stupid Love) (ft.

2	Music is an outlet for all the negative feelings I keep bottled up inside so the fast, aggressive nature of metalcore music with relatable, emotional lyrics has always been my favorite genre of music. It's often dismissed as just "angry" and "screamy", but that's actually not true. I get that it can come across as "intense" for some but that's just because metalcore is brutally honest and expressive about emotions. People just tend to jump to conclusions like that because they don't listen to the lyrics. The lyricism of some bands (e.g. Architects, Silent Planet, Dayseeker, Currents, etc) continue to amuse me with their emotional and philosophical depth. Metalcore is such an genuine genre of music, unlike many popular music these days. Also, the music and the whole community as a whole puts major emphasis on mental health and are expressive advocates for it.\n\nAs an ENFP, I'm obsessed with the notion of searching for the deeper meaning of everything and seeking out for understanding from others and social/emotional connectedness, and this happens to be the genre that gives me all those things. Also, metalheads tend to be some of the best people I've met; they may put on a tough exterior but a lot of them actually have a kind, sensitive heart and are often very open-minded and philiosophical which is very appealing being an ENFP. I wish more people would open up their minds and be more willing to explore this genre. I listen to pretty much all genres, but metalcore is the one that I kept coming back to over the years\n\nBut yeahhhhh, people are often surprised and confused when I tell them I listen to metalcore because I don't "look" like a metalhead and am usually am very friendly and bubbly with people lol. So I don't tell them until they have my trust and are open-minded enough
2	Mongolian Throat Singing. Look up a band called Black Horse Mongolian. Thry are üëåüëåüëå
1	I‚Äôve been listening to a lot of anime covers, particularly Leeandlie‚Äôs. I really adore her! 
1	Matt and Kim. 
10	How do you get along with sensors?	Just curious to know how ENFPs get along with sensors.\n\nI ºve noticed that a lot of INTPs say sensors drive them crazy... but how is it with our kind? Are you good friends with any? What ºs it like? 
15	My closest friends are mostly intuitive, but I think ENFPs are good at being friends with all different kinds because it is interesting to know people who look at the world differently, like sensors. \n\nI think when we say we are driven crazy, what we mean (at least for me) is that the sensors are tougher because ENFPs can be sensitive. I find it's easier to interact w/ the N types because for them it is a little more natural to be sensitive to what we need, what not to say, and are more in touch with the meaning behind our words or body language. \n\nAnd I mean this generally. I think this does not apply to all sensors, but if I've got this right, I think communication and tact are a little bit easier for us. 'Cause for sensors, information is straightforward, while for us, there is a whole world of meaning behind every action/thought/gesture. (A blessing and a curse - I've found this to be overwhelming sometimes, and wish I could just "act" without thinking so hard about why I do things or what the big picture of my actions are).
5	I may have a bit of a skewed perspective since I was raised in a family of all Sensors... It is tough sometimes but once you know to take what they say with a grain of salt and perspective it's a lot easier to get along with everyone. I sometimes get irked by sensor personalities but it's by no means a massive issue. One of my best friends is ESTP and he calls himself the "Extra Special Turd of a Person" and it's so accurate hahaha can count on him for adventures and good times, but I wouldn't try to have emotional conversations with him (he just ends up giving me a weird look and changes the topic).
4	I don't get along with them well. In my experiences so far with them, they're not emotional much at all, they're not sensitive to how others are feeling. They're logical in their nature. 
3	I get along fine with them. Although communicating with them can be an adventure. Apparently they prefer people start at the beginning not the middle...who knew?
2	One of my best friends is an ESFP, amazing guy. Full of life and doesnt get as dragged down by thoughts and emotions as me. So cool to be with. \n\nThe only things that sometimes bothers me is that he is too avoidant of negativity sometimes, but then again sometimes we have really deep moments as well.\n\nI just love his lust and bravado for life. He is one of the very few that can match mine (when I feel good).\n\nI am too much for most others, he gets me. 
1	Sensors?\n
1	Two of my best friends are ISTJs. If you find one who is more mature and well rounded, it can be pretty great. I learn a lot from them, and they help bring much needed structure into my life. They have a deep side to them, you just have to work a little harder to find it. Overall, I have found being friends with them to be a very rewarding experiance that has positively challenged me and broadened my perspective on things.
1	They honestly drive me crazy too as an enfp. I was mistyped as an intp for awhile, but I was just super unhealthy mentally. When this happens, we rely on our shadow functions, one of which being introverted thinking, which led to my mistyping. 
-8	ESTJs drive me crazy. Really if I could enact ethnic cleansing it'd be with the lot of the ESTJs. 
85	I cleaned up my files and now I feel like I can actually manage my life lol	
19	Congrats! I do the same, feel great, then fill up my desktop again within two weeks
12	Me after getting 3000 unread emails down to 0, with an 80% chance of missing something important by just mass deleting
12	This was me after putting the apps on my phone in folders
8	So you mean you put all 43 items on your desktop into "FILE ARCHIVE"?\n\nI kid, I kid :P
5	lmao ikr 
2	Good job! :D
2	I give it 7 hours
1	This is what I did as well! You don‚Äôt wanna see my Documents folder though... 
1	Wohoooo, blender!
1	Love your background! Is it your fav color?? Coz Lavender is my favorite color! üíú
1	Lol the *subtle* music plug
1	Good for you! I feel sooo achieved when I fix any sort of clutter in my life, especially my computer files and stuff. I totally relate :D
1	Ozark: ENFP/INTJ relationship AF	Wendy and Marty Byrde give a classic archetypical performance IMO
3	I can see Marty as an INTJ but think of Wendy as an ExFJ. She seems like a Fe user, IMO
5	On a scale of 1 - 10, how messy are your rooms?	How do you make your room ENFP proof? 
15	Honestly ? By living with a neat-freak INTJ. Mess upsets him so much ( and I don't want to create negative feelings for him ) that I become a neat freak myself.\nObviously, I do every part of the cleaning with music.
3	Either a 1 or a 10 lol
2	Honestly 15 it's very messy 
2	Right now finally a 1. But it took me about 1.5 of procrastination before I finally cleaned my room. I guess it was a steady 7 for 1.5 years
2	I would say around a 4
2	99. üòÇ
2	3 or 4!
2	I defy your ENFP scale.  My INTJ answer to your question is No Comment! üòÅ
2	 5, but I always make sure it smells nice 
2	I don't even sleep in there it's so messy.
1	6,4
1	8
1	Maybe a 6
1	8 if I‚Äôm being real hahah
1	Some days a 5 some days a 9.. Im decently clean but sometimes I get in moods where I want to deep clean everything 
1	8 dude
1	How does one crank this dial to 11? Actually right now it‚Äôs only a 9, not too long ago I had to clean it to allow access to some repair men... so I got it down to a 1, but once they finished I spiked to an 8 and have been slowly climbing again.
1	omg so messy; 10, please send help.
1	6.5 It‚Äôs a cozy type of messy and I‚Äôve seen a lot worse.
1	Hmm, right now about a 5. But just because it was a 9 two months ago and couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore. Went to a 2, now back upwards lol.
1	Like a good, solid 9.
1	Starts off as a 1 then days later a 9
1	Right now a 7 but I usually clean it once a week really well and progressively get it messier everyday
4	Observation about physical senses memory	I generally don't remember looks well, by eyesight. An INFJ closest girl friend of mine of 5 years, I couldn't recall her face well if I wanted to, nor the ENFP girl that I've known for a couple weeks. \n\nHowever if I were to recall their body shape, how the hair feels, how the skin feels, I believe I could easily sculpture them.
2	Pretty much the same, we aren't very good with details. For us a person A is a mix of x, y, and z. If we see x, y, or z in isolation we are very uncertain (at least in my experience) if it's person A.\n\nThe same is for words. I will remember what somebody wanted to tell me and how it made me feel, but I will hardly ever remember the exact wording. It's like I put the story together in my own head how I want to remember it, what leads to quite some misunderstandings.
1	Hmm, I'm the opposite. I never forget a face. I am extremely visual. A visual learner.
2	I'm looking for some album suggestions!	I feel like I'm in a musical drought, I need some new stuff!\n\nWhat is your favourite album? I like a lot of different stuff, so genre isn't an issue.\n\nI like stuff that invokes a lot of feeling, send yo shit fam!!
4	Anything by tame impala or arctic monkeys is what I‚Äôm jamming to right now. Tame impala is a perfect vibe and also the lyrics are really clever and fun
2	Some favorites of mine are: \nEverywhere I Go by Lissie; Jungle by Tash Sultana; Until We Go Down by Ruelle. They may not invoke feeling directly with particularly powerful lyrics alone, but the songs as a whole to me are the kind that take you on a journey. I hope you like them!
2	I've been listening to indie pop/rock kinda stuff and it just has such a chill, happy vibe and every once in a while you get a good sad song. But to name some artist's I'd say Hippo Campus, Cavetown, Attica Riots, Declan McKenna, boy pablo, Lunar Vacation, Good Kid, half‚Ä¢alive, and the Wallows (featuring the main guy character from 13 Reason's Why & Goosebumps - I didn't know he was both an actor and in a sick band)\n\nI always have music phases and this is my current one. Hope someone likes it too! \n\n(I apologize for my sporadic comment lol)
2	i have two absolute favorites and i couldn‚Äôt pick!!!!! they are\n\nGolden Hour (2018)‚ÄîKacey Musgraves\n\nand\n\nCleopatra (2016)‚ÄîThe Lumineers\n\nNot super indie or anything (I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre pretty well known) but hey, maybe it‚Äôll help :)
2	All of Odeszas albums 
2	"Excerpts from a future past" by h√§llas, a new band doing amazing 70s vibe chill fantasy rock \nIf you are feeling really adventurous\n"Misleading evil" by Hazzerd is a new thrash metal band is very fast but has this grooves that will have you headbanging and dancing, while also having very melodious stuff to help you catch your breath 
2	My favorite artist is Fiona Apple. She only has 4 albums but they are amazing start to finish. Few artists can make an album where I love and feel all the songs. She is the best lyricist I've ever heard and also the most intense. If you want to get into her like me start with Extraordinary Machine. It is lighter and feels good. Then work your way back to her first 2 albums which are more intense and painful. And her latest album which is more mature and different.\n\nOther than that I love Kate Nash's first album. Anything by Paramore. My Chemical Romance Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge and The Black Parade, Panic! at the Disco first album and second. She & Him Volume 1 and Volume 2. Arctic Monkeys first 2 albums, particularly first (Whatever People Say I am That's What I'm Not), Fratellis 1st album. Finally Woken by Jem. These are the albums I have listened to full through many times and love every song on them.\n\nBtw I'm a 32 year old straight man.
1	The BROCKHAMPTON albums are not lacking in emotion at all especially the sad boi songs and the ending tracks each of the SATURATION trilogy feature Bearface who is a master or expressing emotion. The Hippo Campus albums are fantastic and semi-experimental. Joji is the definition of sad boi. Bon Iver is a classic if you wanna feel a lot of emotions quickly. Lush by Snail Mail is an incredible guitar driven indie rock album and Soccer Mommy has Clean which is another amazing indie rock narrative driven record. I'm an ENFP that knows a lot about music. 
1	Hamilton, Steven Universe album (dramatic: ‚Äúit‚Äôs over isn‚Äôt it‚Äù), the fray, panic! at the disco, Hayley sabella, leeandlie‚Äôs anime covers can be hella dramatic because #anime, some of the music from spirited away/castle in the sky/Princess Mononoke (my fave soundtrack is from Kiki‚Äôs delivery service)
1	I also like Imogen heap‚Äôs album Ellipse!
1	The Evens, Pavement, sheer Mag, Cat Power
1	Colour and the Shape by Foo Fighters. In fact i‚Äôm pretty sure Dave Grohl is ENFP, maybe that‚Äôs why i‚Äôm so connected to his music? 
1	look into the artist Flume. he‚Äôs a very talented artists that makes electronic music but some of his songs are SERIOUSLY packed w emotion. smoke & retribution, hyperparadise, and intro are my favorite.\n\n
27	10 minutes in this forum helped me clear up my confusion of what I am: ENFP	I have been one of those people who were JUST NOT SURE which type they fit .. as I could see myself both introverted AND extroverted, thinking AND feeling  - depending on my mood, current phase, and people I am with.\n\nI was quite happy to be sure of my N and P (albeit sometimes still debating with myself about that). \nI am one of those people whose scores in a personality vary from day to day, minute to minute, thought to thought  (‚ÄûWell I am extroverted but I can be quite introverted as well..‚Äú, ‚ÄûOh am I really sure that this is true for me? Maybe the opposite is also true?‚Äú)\n\nI started with believing I was ENTP, then ENFP, then INFP, then INTP and then back to ENFP. \n\nSo spending my first minutes in this forum cleared this up for me, as it showed me that everything I was experiencing was but a symptom of what I really am - once and for all: ENFP (Ne)\n\nAmen :) \n\n

16	That INTJ is happy, you can see it on its face.
4	Which is intj and enfp
2	Adorable! I think I would get a dog if I knew this would happen.  But alas the queens would not be ok with this. üòâ
15	I retook the test out of boredom and got ENFP	I originally got INFP to start and have taken multiple times since out of curiosity or boredom since and get either INFP or ENFP. So I am subscribed to both subreddits as a way to better understand where I belong more. However, I've read many different articles online and discussion boards and have come to the conclusion that I'm truly an ENFP. Where as my I and E function is almost in the middle every time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's said that we are the "most introverted extroverts" which definitely rings true for me. I enjoy being alone and such but have weekly and regular meetups with friends and always look forward to them. And in spite of this I find myself craving being alone with my thoughts and reading/writing but not sharing what I'm really up to all the time with everyone. I take initiative with people who are more Introverted but take a back seat to those who are more Extra. I don't know what any of that really means, if anything, but it's just fun to speculate and wonder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut at least I know for certain that the other personality characteristics are consistent. Just the main thing that changes is my output and implementation of them all. Don't know if anyone else relates to this but thought I would share anyway. Thank you and have a nice day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n 
6	You should try reading about the cognitive functions if you have not done that already. Many people say that is the best way to find out your type. See which one fits best with the way you think.
3	Definitely feel you on all of this! I tested into ENFP consistently, but took another test that put me in INFP. Probably not super uncommon with these personality types.
3	OMg i literally just subscribed to BOTH forums a MINUTE ago and the first thing I see is your post !\n\nI can relate 100% and while I am quite sure of NFP (although sometimes on the thinking side as well) I vary between E and I ... I think when I was younger I was definitely E but once I got older (late teens maybe) I kinda began to move towards the I .. \n\nNow, I feel like I am both - depending on situation, mood, phase and people I am with (I SO know what you mean with taking the back seat in some relationships and then taking the lead kn another) \n\nMind-blown haha :) 
2	Heeey enfp/infp squad!! 
2	I relate to this very strongly! I take the test somewhat frequently, and was ENFP every time until a few years ago during a major depressive episode, in which I became INFP, however, after that episode I was once again ENFP. I definitely tend to become "chameleon" around others depending on the energy level. Around introverts, I seem like a strong extrovert, however, around other extroverts, I'm more introverted. To me, balance is important, and in social situations, I like to take the role of whatever will best balance the situation. As you say, and from what I've read, yes ENFP's are the more introverted extroverts, and we like balance. I enjoy silence, and lively conversation, but need a balance of spotlight, and being in the background speculating and processing what's going on in front of me. 
2	I have heard ENFP's always question if they are INFP's but INFP's never question if they are INFP's. We are the most introverted extroverts as you said. We need a lot of alone time, like tons, to learn and analyze and decompress and enjoy the things we like. We are only the fun, silly, social stereotype a little bit of the time. But INFP is not just the introverted version of ENFP, we have different functions and think differently. \n\nBut you should understand the I or E just means our top function is introverted or extroverted. And Jung used introverted and extroverted differently. To him extroverted meant directed outwardly and wide, while introverted is directed inwardly and deep.\n\nI talked to an INFP guy a lot about our differences and the biggest was that because he as an INFP led with Introverted Feeling he needed everything to be related to him or his values or emotions for him to consider it important or worthwhile. Anything theoretical or silly or not personally related to him was not important. I did a creativity exercise where you imagine a spoon (or fork) and try to think of as many different ways it could be used besides for eating. I can think of 50 easily. But he couldn't really do it at all. So I had to frame it like he was on a desert island and only had a spoon and then he could think of things to use it for.\n\nSo for an INFP their Ne is incredibly limited as it is their 2nd fuction, only used for things that pass the Fi test. For ENFP's we use Ne without limit, completely free and unrestricted as itis our dominant function. Then we pass it through Fi after (if applicable).\n\nIf you have no idea about functions check this:\n\nhttps://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/if-youre-confused-about-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-read-this-an-intro-to-cognitive-functions/\n\nhttps://www.typeinmind.com/nefi/
2	I test between 50/50 and 55/45 split for I (majority) to E. I know what you mean; I'd say I'm an extroverted introvert. I test INFP and INFJ so I subscribe to both.
2	What functions do ENFP need to develop and how have you tried developing them?	Was chatting with an INTP friend who was telling me about the four functions and how I need to develop my fourth function. I don‚Äôt understand what he was saying but I feel I need to develop my ‚Äòthinking‚Äô as I‚Äôm always making very emotional decisions. \n\nWhat is best for enfp to develop and how to develop them?\n\nThanks :)
5	you should really learn the ENFP survival guide! (jump to after the attached link if you feel like skipping the explanation of the functions, to read them after the advice of how to develop them)\n\nto understand cognitive functions you need a little research, but this is how I understand them, in order of how we access them:\n\nNe is the overthinking, the theory making, the crazy ideas, the always getting distracted and having a lot of shit in mind\n\nFi is our value system, also the principal function we go to when making decisions, is the "do unto others as you want to be done upon yourself" core value we hold\n\nTe is the logic we have to solve problems, look for better ways to do shit, criticize, debate and also make quick decisions.\n\nSi we use to store all the interesting knowledge,  following detailed instructions, and keeping a system, helps us being consistent, reliable, and actually implementing our ideas.(yeah doesn't sound like us, because if its underdeveloped it definitely isn't us, but it can be! we have it in us.) \n\n[https://www.typeinmind.com/nefi/](https://www.typeinmind.com/nefi/) here you can read more about them.\n\nFrom my expierence, the best way to develop my tertiary(Te) and fourth(Si) functions has been with friends' help! \n\nI have a very close friend who is an ENTJ and they lead with Te so it has really helped me to be more efficient and logical about what I do, also to help me see how fucking smart I really am.\n\nMy roomate is an ESTJ they lead with Si, so he has helped learn to keep habits and routines and get shit done.\n\nAnother way to really develop your Si is to get into an exercise routine and healthy eating habit, trust me it does really help a lot not having to worry about not dying of health problems and looking fooking hot in the process. \n\nBut Te and Si go hand in hand that developing one will develop the other, I think to kinda tackle Te more you should do lots of good shit for your brain, like problem solving tasks like puzzle video games! finding friends with whom to debate with, feels like your INTP friend can really help with that! \n\nIm still in the process of developing them but I wish you good luck!
1	Here man, check these out for a starting off point:\n\nhttps://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/if-youre-confused-about-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-read-this-an-intro-to-cognitive-functions/\n\nhttps://www.typeinmind.com/nefi/
3	Can ENFPs seem more like other types (even or ESPECIALLY to themselves) than other types ?	I ask this because for a very long time I didn‚Äôt realize I was F .. I feel like I behaved like a ENTP on the surface - even fooling myself - in order not to get hurt. And also because my mother is quite irrational and I felt like I had to protect myself by being logical and ‚Äûright‚Äú .. so basically, BECAUSE I am ENFP I acted like an ENTP \n\nAlso, I feel like albeit being an ENFP, I have become a little more ‚ÄûI‚Äú than I used to be and I feel it might also just be BECAUSE I am ENFP and it can be quite draining .. \n\nCan anyone relate ? 
3	Yes
2	You Ne valued users (the NPs) can endlessly loop with figuring out your types.
2	I can relate to this. First, enfps are one of the most introverted extroverted types. Extroversion for enfps is in the realm of ideas not necessarily with people. I always thought I was more of a T type too.  I realized though that the information i process is funneled through my morals and what I feel as being authentic which is the Fi personality trait at work, so despite my resistance to it I‚Äôve concluded I‚Äôm definitely an enfp.
1	Have you studied the cognitive functions? Because then you will see that you might just be using oe of your other functions at certain times.\n\nhttps://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/if-youre-confused-about-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-read-this-an-intro-to-cognitive-functions/\n\nhttps://www.typeinmind.com/nefi/
2	When interacting with other types, which dimension expression do you find most important ?	I‚Äòve noticed that the most important dimension is N/S for me (definitely preferring N over S) and that will usually determine if there is mutual understanding between me and the other person .. \n\nOrder of importance of preferred function: \n\n1. N over S\n2. F over T\n3. P over J\n\n\nCan you relate ? 
3	I was gonna comment about how I love other neurotic people....until I googled and realized the N is for intuitive
2	N first :) I've grown up a lot though and come to really appreciate S's, but don't always expect a deep conversation from them. The others simply vary. I have friends of all types. Closest tend to be INFXs or ISFXs
2	N first. I tend to bond by telling stories about life, philosophizing, trying to find abstract meaning... The S I‚Äôve encountered are more interested in concrete things it seems. I‚Äôve really had to push myself to be able to interact with S. It‚Äôs very rare for me to get along with one without our values clashing. 
1	Definetely N over S, but I don't really mind about the others though
1	Have you studied the cognitive functions? There are 8, an inward/introverted and outward/extroverted type for each letter of the Myers Briggs. 4 of these make up each type.\n\nhttps://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/if-youre-confused-about-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-read-this-an-intro-to-cognitive-functions/\n\nhttps://www.typeinmind.com/nefi/\n\n
1	Adventure Time Sunday!	\n/r/ENFP! What shenanigans have you been up to this week? Any new adventures planned for the next?\n\nLet's here some stories!
1	My ESTP boyfriend, my INTP brother, and myself are all going to a place called Andy B's next week where my older brother (INFP) is a bartender! I'm excited because I've been before and it was so fun. We played lazer tag, arcade games, Virtual Reality, and bowled for free! (because my brother works there - but only on weekdays it's free for us, and we still have to pay for food) Now I'm ready to take my ESTP boyfriend because I know he'll have a blast :)
5	ENFP guy whose new to Reddit! How many of us are here? :D	
2	Welcome to our secret hideout bro. 
106	I gave a homeless guy a warm sandwich and a hot chocolate on a cold night	And then my phone‚Äôs navigation system magically worked again.\n\nI was like ‚ÄúOmg maybe there‚Äôs a god!!‚Äù So I told my boyfriend about it.\n\nBut then the navigation system broke again after I told him. And I was like ‚ÄúMaybe I shouldn‚Äôt have told anyone about my good deed!‚Äù\n\nBut then my phone kinda got fixed but kinda not. Turns out it‚Äôs just broken.\n\nBut hey at least a homeless guy got a warm sandwich and hot chocolate tonight. 
26	Literally the Lord's work 
17	What kind of sandwich? I'm hungry and this is an important detail.
6	THIS. This is what the world needs more of. The silly, goofy, kind-hearted, good samaritan ENFPs.
4	You‚Äôre awesome :)
4	You're funny. 
4	This sounds like something I would do lol. 
3	Oh boy
1	That was really nice of you!
1	lol, I read the title and was like "Ugh, virtue signaling much?" (Not that it wouldve changed the good deed at all!) but then read the next line and had to laugh 
1	The world definitly needs more people like you. I wish I could give more to the homeless, but I often dont have food/money on me at the time. Either that or parents ask me to  "move on"
7	Has anyone had a successful ENFP/INTJ Relationship?	I've heard a lot about this dynamic duo of these Myers Brigg's types in a relationship & am curious if there's merely just initial attraction or if it can pan out long-term?
10	Married. In love. Been together for 10 years, married for 2 years in May. He keeps me sane, I keep him insane. Its perfect.
6	Been married 15 years I think. Holy crap is it difficult and absolutely did/do we have to work at it. I‚Äôm pretty sure we called it quits multiple times. I would like to think we‚Äôre both good people, just different. A therapist real early on said we were welcome to come back but she‚Äôs never seen a couple like us work out. So we found a therapist that believed in us. \n\nMy wife frustrates me to no end (it‚Äôs mutual, I assure you) but I could never see myself with anyone else. She is everything I want and am trying to be and am working every damn day to make a better emotional connection. Every year it gets better as we both mellow out. Retirement is going to be fricking awesome.  \n\nI would absolutely call our relationship successful. Not sure if 15 years is long enough to declare it but I think we beat the over/under our friends and family had on us. 
5	Of course people have.  That said this relationship long term relationships are a marathon and "mirage / illusion" relationships^(more on this term later) have problems with the middle of the relationship while they can have fabulous / fantastic starts and fabulous / fantastic ends.  Quotes an INFJ author.\n\n>The end justifies the means.\n\n>But what if there never is an end?\n\n>All we have is means.\n\nENFPs and INTJ relationships being "illusion / mirage" have problems with "energizing" each other for the day to day things, and keeping the day to day things close.  But relationships are multifaceted and you do not just have a relationship with your partner but also with other people, and the environment itself.  The "illusionary / mirage" relationships work a whole lot better if the ENFP is getting the right amount of goldilocks Si energy from other sources (not just their partner, but their partner should contribute), and the INTJ is getting the right amount of goldilocks Se energy from other sources (not just their partner) for when the ENFP is energized (and they need Si energy to properly function) and the INTJ is energized these two partners have a whole lot of fun being near each other, but if they are not getting this energy there is frustration, spinning your wheels, avoidance, inflation, brake, resentiment, and a whole lot more other words.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow what is this "mirage / illusion" type thing I am talking about?  It is a socionics term.  Each type so ENFP will have relationships with the 16 other types.  Socionics thinks there are 14 different types of relationship, 12 types of relationships where there is some form of symmetry where both sides are getting something from the relationship, and 2 types of relationships that are asymmetrical where one partner is getting all the benefits while the other person is being sucked like a leach / used like a giving tree and thus these 2 asymmetrical relationships have 2 different roles and 2*2=4 and 4+12 = 16.\n\nSo what I am saying is each type has an illusionary / mirage relationship and with ENFPs it is the ILI (ILI is the 3 letter name in Socionics and the 4 letter name is INTp in Socionics naming, but most MBTI INTJs are Socionics 's INTps for their naming is weird.  And most INTP in MBTI are INTj / LII in socionics.)  Likewise the ILI / INTp / INTJ illusionary / mirage relationship is also the ENFP.  Things that are fare away the INTJ and ENFP agree upon, moments of relaxation are also fun, these partners rarely fight, the problem is are they making sure their partner gets what they need in more concrete, physical, sensory stuff, are they being provided for?  For what an INTJ needs from the world in material providing things is different than an ENFP and the skillsets of an INTJ and ENFP are both great / grand but they suck at providing what the other partner needs.  So if their needs are being met the relationship works great in the middle phase, and if their needs are not getting met well like a  marathon runner they may lose distance and progress.
3	Yes. The secret to success is to keep your ENFP tied up in the basement or freezer. 
2	yes
2	no
1	Not for me! Great potential and initial attraction. I really think attachment style plays into this pairing working long term too. Attachment in these terms is essentially one‚Äôs overall level of ‚Äúokayness‚Äù (I‚Äôm okay and you‚Äôre okay). In my youth, I was never the overly independent ENFP type, (in attachment terms, I have never had the avoidant attachment that many articles about ENFPs discuss). I have always been much more anxious/preoccupied, so when I was unhealthy I did not do well with super independent partners. Didn‚Äôt like overly clingy ones either, but this is a different topic for a different time so I digress.\n\n\n. I wanted someone to travel with and go on adventures and just experience life with. I think INTJs want the opposite of this, or so it seems/ has been in my experience. I‚Äôm 28 now, but when I was younger -NTJs (or Ni users) were very career focused, whereas I was ‚Äúahhh let‚Äôs just have fun, career can come later‚Äù. They enjoyed my fun, but it was distracting to their long term goals. I think their long term goals are important, too. INTJs (and ENTJs) have big dreams, and I think they need to feel they have accomplished them before they really settle down and allow themselves to be distracted by a special someone. 
1	Yes. My INTJ and I got married and were looking forward to growing old together. There were hard times here and there that came about more as a result of our individual broken family origins (and at times exacerbated by our personality differences), but the beauty of it was that we were both goal-oriented and highly committed to improving our relationship by whatever means necessary. 
1	Friends, yes.  Lovers, no.
1	the dynamic is overrated. \n
1	Define "successful".
1	I‚Äôve been in a loving relationship with an INTJ for the last 4 years. <3 I would describe ourselves as loyal, constructive, protective, physically independent (LDR), curious, enjoy just spending time together, love love talking, & emotionally dependent. My partner definitely brings stability to my life. I bring chaos and validation and hella emotions to his. We can have times where our steps in life don‚Äôt match up, but we have the same goals. Our motto is ‚Äúwe‚Äôll find a way or we‚Äôll make one.‚Äù\n\nDespite how differently we approach problems, there‚Äôs a magnetism in how we understand each other and complement each other so well. From the first week we met, I knew I‚Äôd do anything for him. <3 \n\nTo echo what others have said, part of what I‚Äôm doing atm is some self-improvement. My partner felt pressured that I considered him my world, and felt that I had too much happiness dependent on him. (He‚Äôs much more career/financial stability- oriented. I‚Äôm the ‚Äòlet‚Äôs get hitched 3 years ago bc the world runs on love‚Äô type). Now I‚Äôm getting into running, cooking, tidying up, etc, which has been improving my mood. He seems happy knowing my mood has been more stable & consistently happy. Like a lot of y‚Äôall, I have depression/anxiety, and when bouts hit, I depend a lot on my partner, because no one else really gets me...???\n\nIn short: we think very differently. and we love each other, very loyally. he shows his emotions around me; I feel safe and more organized around him. There are conflicts, but we always look to improve ourselves and solve the conflict. Open conversation is a must. Especially when one of us is feeling burnt out by the other (him- when I‚Äôm too needy, me- when I‚Äôm not feeling cared for enough). \n\nHe‚Äôs going to be a lawyer, and I‚Äôm going to be a clinical psychologist, of course.
1	Yes! Been married 5 years.  I mean I want to either punch him in the face or get him into bed 99% of the time...  \nBut seriously, we are a power couple and we even each other out.
2	ENFP and procrastination	So, I don't know how procrastination fits within the ENFP personality. I'd say it is probably very frustrating (as for all personalities). \n\nWhat are your thoughts on it?\n\nWhat is the best way for an ENFP to cope with it? (Not that s*** on the internet, I want pure reddit advice)
3	Yes, procrastination is very real with ENFP.\nThe last year I use Mel Robbins‚Äô 5 second rule to get myself to do things right away
3	I try to focus on using my Ne for the positive side of procrastination. Since I can easily see the future and what is expected I can use this an  opportunity to get things done earlier than most. I can then use this vision to connect to the bigger picture of a great work ethic, since how I do anything is how I do everything. \n\nI do not always do it but it helps me procrastinate less. I am currently working SQL coding instead of playing games all day like I used to. That way I can be prepared when there is an opportunity. 
2	I've learned to accept it, I've developed my Te and Si to a point that I feel sure I'll have enough time to do what need to be done so I don't stress about it, for example:there is this report I have to do about a CG model I did, I've had this assignment for months, I took one free Sunday to do the model and a little time in class, and have been procrastinating writing the report for a month, is due to Tuesday, but I know it'll take about just an hour to do it(yeah probably it will most likely three or more hours) and tomorrow Monday I know I'll get my ass in front of the pc first thing in the morning( we'll after breakfast) and get it done!\nSo one way to not feel frustrated is to be aware of how long doing it will take and know that you have set time apart to do it, and then feel free to procrastinate until it comes, and if for some reason you feel like doing it before that, do it!\nAlso it can help to find ways to make the boring task more fun, be excited about a new album you'll have the opportunity to listen while you are doing it, or about what you may learn or the skills you'll practice while doing it, if you feel excited about doing it you may not even want to procrastinate 
0	Myers-Briggs personality test has no validity whatsoever	[https://www.vox.com/2014/7/15/5881947/myers-briggs-personality-test-meaningless](https://www.vox.com/2014/7/15/5881947/myers-briggs-personality-test-meaningless)
15	If it's non existent, why did you take the time to find this sub and post? The test has minimal scientific validity, I agree, but it's far better than horoscopes and people love reading about themselves (me included)
9	MBTI is considered to be a soft science section. Yes, it's more of a theory, but honestly identifying my type helped me a lot.\n\nI'm mostly just gonna point out that yes, we're not technically just one type. It was explained that we are both extroverts and introverts, sensors and intuitives, thinkers and feelers, judgers and percievers. But that's where the concept of Shadow functions come in. For example, if I, as an ENFP Ne-dom ran with Ni instead, I would be unhappy. Can I do Ni functions? Yes. Do I want to do Ni functions? No. And if you pull my inferior Si out of the bag I wouldn't like it. That's just how my brain works, not unless I get slapped with cold trauma that would rewire the way I think.\n\nMBTI isn't supposed to just generalize people, it studies certain and specific individuals to help them based on the cognitive functions. You're more likely to heal an ENFP by feeding their Ne, but if another ENFP was tested with Ne failure and was using their tertiary Fi, then your interaction with them should be different than the Ne one ... yet, they're still ENFPs and still unique from the other at the same time.
4	Duh. Study the cognitive functions and decide for yourself.
3	> "The characteristics measured by the test have almost no predictive power on how happy you'll be in a situation, how you'll perform at your job, or how happy you'll be in your marriage."\n\nThat's not what I was taking the test for in the first place, plus I beg to differ - it definitely does predict how happy I'll be stuck in a dumb repeat-task job versus a creative job.\n\n> There's also another related problem with these limited choices: look at the chart above, and you'll notice that words like "selfish," "lazy," or "mean" don't appear anywhere. \n\n...Implying things like "lazy" and "mean" are scientifically explained. They're not.\n\nI agree that MBTI itself is mediocre (my INFJ friend got repeatedly tested as INTJ), but the Jungian theory & functions themselves are *far* from being useless. Just read some Jung and if that doesn't help, you likely haven't thought it through. Jung's theories are **far** beyond any modern psychology that I know of (prove me wrong) and he's been dead for almost 60 years. \n\nPeople just haven't grown up to him yet and of course nowadays here comes quantum physics suddenly explaining every "quack" theory (like synchronity) that people ever had before discovery of quantum physics. Obviously there will always be people who disregard **completely** anything that can't be explained by science and can't get around the fact that there always will be things unexplained by science, but that doesn't mean we should hinder ourselves by not making our own (intuitive) observations and decisions.

-6	So why bother talking and discussing about something that is non-existent? Don't get me wrong, I took the test and I came out as an ENFP, but if the results are based on total BOGUS why even bother? This is a serious question and I woulf love to hear different viewpoints!
9	What do ENFP's think about the motto "facts don't care about your feelings"?	Just genuinely curious.
16	It depends on the context, but I think it sounds like someone is trying to act rational in order to ignore the point of a discussion. 
5	I'm ENFP 4w5 and I 100% agree with this.
7	Facts don't have feelings to being with. So I don't necessarily agree with the statement.\n\nI see facts as an objective way to observe what happens around us. We choose how to respond to that through our emotions. If facts don't align with what we want, we can get frustrated. It's truly our stubbornness that doesn't care about the facts.
8	My experience is that this motto is most often not applied to facts, but to a narrative based on a selection of (cherry picked) facts. \nThe selection is often based on your values and, if heavily opposing my deep held values, feelings will matter to me. ( I will also spell out exactly 8378 other, equally true, facts to show why I feel you are wrong.)\n\n
3	It depends on your definition of a fact. Is it something like an unchangeable way of the world, like death? Or is it something completely changeable, like human and animal rights, ‚Äúhow things are,‚Äù and the ‚Äúway the world works‚Äù? \n\nYou should also consider that feelings are going to happen whether you want them to or not. Feelings are facts. You‚Äôll have to embrace your emotional side and keep discovering the nature of your own mind and being, before you can truly understand your own biases and misconceptions. What you might think of as a fact of life, might actually be something you really *really* want to think of as a fact of life, because of some experience you had that‚Äôs still deep inside you.
3	The person who said this has very inferior Fi.
4	I‚Äôm totally down with the saying.  I‚Äôd just say that facts rarely convince someone on their own, otherwise people would believe in global climate change:)  \n\nIf you want to change someone‚Äôs mind appeal to their emotions as well as their logic.  
2	Its fine. Facts are still subject to interpretation. It means as much to me as someone saying "look at the data". Like, okay, you still need to communicate the information. Feelings help you communicate. Your facts mean nothing if you can't do that, the world turns regardless of facts. 
1	Meh, I agree with it logically. It‚Äôs similar to ‚Äúthe truth hurts‚Äù or ‚Äúlife isn‚Äôt fair‚Äù. It‚Äôs objectively true. However, I can‚Äôt imagine anyone saying it in any discussion who isn‚Äôt being a dick 
1	I think it‚Äôs something people say when they actively enjoy antagonizing those who are more emotionally vulnerable than they are.
1	True. But feelings do care about facts, sometimes. There is a stereotype of all Feelers that we can't be logical or our ruled by our feelings. But I know as an ENFP, although I have strong principles and values they are not illogical and if I get new information I can change and adapt them.\n\nBut as for the original question. It basically boils down to "Some things just are, no matter if you like them or not." Like death. Or taxes. But the thing about that is that your attitude towards facts can change and your feelings towards them so that you can accept them.\n\nOn the other hand it also could be that someone is trying to present a "fact" without regard fir someone's feelings. Like saying someone is ugly. That may be so to you but you don't have to say it. Facts may not care about feelings but people should. If you don't you're an asshole.
1	Well. The point of that statement is if there are statistics that clearly indicate that whatever a person is going on about is false they can't hang on to their argument just because they are more emotionally involved.
1	Yes !! I love Ben Shapiro 
1	I feel that it is a fact! \n\nI can say that facts may not care about your feelings but, I do! After all, I am human and we are all sharing this human experience. Emotion exists no matter how much self control we use to reign them. We all feel to some degree. So, why deny them?\n\nFacts are not evil, it‚Äôs how we wield them that brings harm or haven. \n\nStay classy
1	I would say that feelings don't care about your facts. \n\nLook at the Great Orange Oompa Loompa.
53	My best friend and I: INTJ/ENFP duo	I don't hold much stock in all these personality tests because everyone's an individual and all, but I still like looking at 'X characters as myers briggs personalities' etc etc and I do have a soft spot for them because it feels a bit more sensible than horoscopes (for example). Anyway through browsing r/INTJ yesterday (I'm an INTJ) I eventually ended up here and stumbled upon this idea that my personality type fits really well with you guys (supposedly?). I scoffed a bit, but out of interest asked my best friend - who I have really dynamic discussions with and love spending time with- what her type was and lo and behold: ENFP. Feels kind of bizarre but also a sense of 'oh right, of course, that makes sense' !
52	ENFPs corrupting the souls of INTJs one moment at a time.
12	I agree with you that there are a lot of determining factors besides a type that brings chemistry to a relationship, but I adore the typical cognitive functions of the intj person,(being enfp) our differences mesh well usually.  There's a silent understanding in the quiet moments and the banter and discussions are fun too.
10	I'm an ENFP.  Three of my lifelong best friends are INTJ's.  It just works out that way.
9	I am male and almost 40. Of my 4 best friends, 3 of them are INTJ. The other one is another ENFP. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an accident. People come and go, but these are the ones that stuck with me. And I only found out about their MBTI types last year. We‚Äôve been friends for twenty years or more. 
8	I‚Äôm an INTJ, my best friend is an ENFP. All our friends tell us that we each have very different personalities and wonder how we can relate to each other so well. I don‚Äôt know how either, but one thing I know for sure is that we can discuss philosophical things and random ideas for hours and hours. I love my ENFP best friend so much! 
3	Confirmed. My BFF is INTJ and so is my boyfriend! And my ex üòÜ
2	INTJ best friend as well. They're surprisingly energetic. They get me out of my house doing productive stuff. Doesn't get too deep and emotional usually, not compared to the depths of my soul and emotions as an ENFP anyway. But there is definitely thought provoking conversation! 
17	I made a comment on another ENFP post and thought I should share what I commented cause what I‚Äôm discussing actually has been making me kind of sad the past few days. Read at your own discretion... it‚Äôs long	Yo I‚Äôm an ENFP girl and I‚Äôve always thought that my quirky personality hinders me from being perceived as sexually attractive. I always feel like I should hide around people l like or just in general (which is bad I know). But, it took a lot for me to get to the point where I can be the extroverted friend in a friend group rather than having a panic attack from entering a store where I have to speak to a cashier. After all that l went through to get to this point, it just wouldn't be right for me to hide myself. You may be asking why I feel like people perceive me as sexually unattractive... its cause I have always been friend zoned, a rebound, used because someone was bored, or I am at least 90 % of the time rejected. I have never been genuinely approached by people who would actually like to take me out for the sake of getting to know me as a person rather than how good I would be in bed. I fear that no genuine approaches have been made because l am the "weird" girl. I used to try and approach people but after my last experience I have given up even trying to talk to new people, even to make friends. The situation was pretty heavyweight so.... yeah. I feel like I have reluctantly accepted the fact that people will probably never find me worthy as a significant other. I have accepted the heavy feeling of lonesomeness and no longer try to rid it from myself. It sucks cause l am a very protective kind of person so l would be a very attentive and supportive partner cause l care about people SO MUCH, almost too much. I would die for some of my friends even no matter the pain they put me through some days because, well, the heart wants what the heart wants and it cant be changed. I surround myself with my close friends any chance I get but it never takes the loneliness away. All I desire is a person that I can cuddle with, make soup for them when theyre sick, watch them conquer their biggest fears, wake up to their face at the dawn of day, and just overall feel a caring presence by my side This got real dramatic oops but I havent exactly vocalized or put my thoughts into words before but this was a post that was suitable enough to do so. If you read this far, thanks for your time. TL:DR I am an ENFP and have struggled in the relationship department as well. Like the person who originally posted this, I feel the need to hide my personality too. It has affected me a lot. Thats the gist.\n\n\n\n\nOkay so I was trying to respond to a comment and ended up typing out A SUPER LONG add-on to the post so I am just going to paste it below:\n\nWAY TL:DR- I discuss how I portray myself to others around me, purposefully through expression and non-purposely through my job or friends. Because of all the factors piling up on top of each other, I feel like it is impossible to seem desirable in a romantic relationship.\n\nHELLO THERE. FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE COMMENTING IN THIS POST, THANK YOU I LOVE THE FEEDBACK!!! ITS SUPER LONG SO READ AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION. \nFor context, this was being typed out as response to someone saying they dont view themselves as conventionally hot or sexy because of their personality. I heavily elaborated on my view of this below. Plus, some of the stuff I am talking about goes along with stuff other people commented. Anyway, welcome to the much longer second half of the post:\n\n\n\n\nyessss exactly. I can never imagine myself as being objectively ‚Äúhot‚Äù or sexy. In either a professional environment (I work at a restaurant as a Hostess)I tend to hide the quirky parts of my personality since I take my job pretty seriously: to give our customers a good first impression of the place and, just in general, envelop a more professional demeanor... A lot of the times when I work (and I hope this doesn‚Äôt come off as bragging cause I swear its just mere fact), I get told at least once or twice a shift that I am attractive and/or should model. These comments are typically coming from older women/men at least in their 50‚Äôs. I feel that the reason they find me conventionally attractive is just from a objective standpoint: I tend to wear more feminine business/ business-casual clothing when I work/ (a lot of the times I wear things that show my figure. I feel that I have a pretty feminine body/face. The only thing that right off the bat isn‚Äôt presented as feminine is my hair cause I have a pixie cut. BUT older women tend to have shorter hair more often than younger women from where I come from and therefore, they don‚Äôt find it super odd that my hair is cut short. A lot of the times they will say that love my hair and thats its very ‚Äúdaring‚Äù cause younger women where I live rarely cut their hair my length. sheesh what a long parentheses.), I also feel that I give off a ‚Äúhousewife‚Äù vibe because, as a hostess, you‚Äôre expected to take care of customers and make them feel as comfortable as possible (being a hostess is clearly a more traditionally feminine role and, as the majority of customers here are older than 60, my position at the restaurant fits into their more boxed perception of women), and lastly, clearly none of these people are trying to start a relationship with me. they only see me as attractive from a surface level view and the farthest sort of relationship that is possible to develop with me is to make a good impression on the restaurant in order to get ‚Äúbetter quality service as a regular.‚Äù \n\nOutside of work, I tend to portray myself as more androgynous: I wear my hair short as mentioned before, I wear a variety of clothing but (most days at this point in time) its fairly neutral/androgynous, I rarely wear makeup (but thats mostly cause I don‚Äôt see it as a necessity. Whenever i do do it, I LOVE it. I just prefer to save it for special occasions), I keep my eyebrows as thick as possible cause #thickeyebrowsruletheworldyo‚úåüèº(also, fun fact, I mentioned in my original post that it took me awhile to feel good about myself... the reason I have felt so poorly about myself in the past was because of HEAVY bullying. One thing kids targeted were my eyebrows. Now, i‚Äôm proud of them and somedays wish they were thickerüòÇ sometimes i just feel that people when specifically men are hypothetically attracted to me, its a turn off), sometimes I purposely make my voice sound deeper cause i like the way it sounds, I am very confrontational and opinionated person rather than passive (and am not afraid to be open as yall can tell, lol) I am a slight natural-born leader and come off as pretty dominant, I am a very artistic person and hang around with the ‚Äúartsy‚Äù people, lol (also, another note on friends, I have a huge amount of acquaintances, a medium amount of people I can call friends, and a very small hand full of close friends. among the entire population of people I associate with, there is a pretty fair amount of diversity. With my artistic friend group, I fit right in :) and they embrace every part of me and its just great in general. Little to no complaints here as a whole!!! Next, the people that are, idk, your ‚Äústandard meme lovers, genuine people that want to find meaning in life, and STRONG personalities‚Äù (this friend group is so hard to categorize as a whole so this my best description of them all as a collective bunch, lol), I seem to fit in if you are analyzing outsider perspectives of our group but, from within the group, I feel that I just kind of mix in like a salad. There‚Äôs different personalities in the group and we are all unique in our own way but we fit together except, I feel like the ‚Äúlettuce‚Äù of the salad. I don‚Äôt stand out in the group because 1) there are some god damn STRONG personalities in the group that take the spotlight any chance they get so its hard to even express three words of your opinion before you are interrupted and 2) my sense of humor is very different from the majority of the people so when I try to make a joke or be sarcastic, no one laughs or sometimes acknowledges it. I am kind of the throw away friend in the group; if I were to leave the group it would affect NOTHING. you may be asking while I still tag along with this group... its because they have a genuine need to find the purpose of life and are always lively and energetic and are willing to have productive and in-depth conversations. I CANT GET ENOUGH OF IT so I stay. Lastly, I have a ‚Äúchoppy‚Äù all-girl group that is as girly as you can get: they all love to talk about the hottest dude on their netflix shows, love makeup, and just in general exude extremely feminine personas (I like to deem their base personalities as ‚Äúsouthern charm‚Äù: each person is the epitome of a local boutique next to a coffee shop on the main street of a college town. thats the best way I can think to describe it) Now, I describe the group as choppy because, as with typical girl drama, some people just don‚Äôt get along! What a surprise! now, for the people that I pick out of that group and actually like to be around, its about 4-5 people. When we are all together, there is an underlying sense of ‚Äú...something is off.‚Äù the thing that is off is me. I am the person that stands out the most because I am the most different out of them all, the least feminine: I am a metalhead and they listen to trendy music, they are a bit more subdued and passive while I am loud and quirky, they all want to go into a science field and I want to go to an art school, they all want to keep up with their instagrams while I want to stay on track of the current anime that i am watching. YALL GET THE GIST. I stay friends with these people because I can sense that they really care about me... and I really care about them!!!! although my conversation style is a little outside theres, some days they appreciate my own and adapt to it and we have some really meaningful conversations!!! I also like them because they have a clear path in life and are so so SO driven and its inspiring! I tend to hang out with these people the least because they are the most different from me. sometimes its hard to feel a connection because most of the conversations do feel a bit like small talk (and as an ENFP, im pretty sure my personality craves true human connection), sometimes I‚Äôll make a joke or show them a new interest and you can tell that they are immediately put off by it and judgmental about it. sometimes, when they are put off by it, its in a humorous manner and they end up genuinely laughing and finding some slight enjoyment out of just how strange it is. then, i find entertainment off of how how weirded out they are!üòÇ overall, this small group of people are pretty cool and im happy to have them in my life. OMG THIS WAS AN EVEN LONGER PARENTHESES JESUS CHRIST. lets continue with the rest of the post) \n The last thing i want to discuss is identity type stuff. You guys have already gotten a taste of the fact that I am not the most feminine person in the world. You may be wondering ‚Äúomg is she questioning her gender identity?‚Äù the answer is no longer. It took a very short time of being curious of my gender identity to figure that I am without a doubt a cis girl, just tend to have a few masculine tendencies. The only time someone misgendered me is when I was sitting at the back of a lecture hall, wearing a baggy Pink Floyd t-shirt, and my hair was of course short. The professor kept calling me sir until the very end of the lecture when they realized I was a girl and profusely apologized. I told them that I absolutely didn‚Äôt mind and took no offense to it. Actually, I do prefer to be called dude or man as a casual thing just because it evokes a kind of ‚Äúcool‚Äù, ‚Äúchill‚Äù vibe (but one time, someone used he/him pronouns and I was immediately so uncomfortable hearing it. she/her definitely preferred) That being said, if I wanted to take part in a male friend group, I could easily be considered ‚Äúone of the boys‚Äù just because I am comfortable to be around: I dont harshly lean feminine or masculine and am pretty adaptable to any sort of social situation.\nThe problem here is that I am not SUPER clear on my sexuality yet. I don‚Äôt think I am fully straight and a lot of my friends don‚Äôt think so either lol. I guess I would define myself as bisexual with a strong male lean. So, if i were to try and start a relationship with someone, I would most likely center my sights on males.\nWE ARE COMING AROUND TO THE FINALE OF THE POST WOOHOO. \nOn top of everything being said about how I am as a person and the way I portray myself to the world, I feel like its pretty impossible for me to come off as conventionally hot or sexy when it comes to relationships, specifically men.\nBAHAHA wow I could have just used the short paragraph above to describe how I feel but nope! My ADHD brain says otherwise.
9	I like quirky girls i get so bored with normal people so you sound really fun to talk to. I also dont like makeup.  Im not doing well in the relationship department either. I was too focuseed on college and missed opportunities.  You should look for some smart guy. He will probably enjoy your quirks\n\n24 m btw
7	It's easy to be 90% of time rejected when we're the ones putting ourselves out their 90% of the time more than others. \n\nBut I feel ya. This could have been written by me. And you are my new best friend!  <3\n\nI've always been told  (mostly by my mom) "you'd be so pretty if..."\n\n"You'd be pretty if you didn't wear unmatching socks and no makeup and if you didn't wear a dinosaur suit out of the house..." haha. You get my gist. \n\nWe ENFPs don't want to compromise. We want to be loved for quirky US. We think our weirdness makes us lovable and there's something wrong with the rest of the population who wants us to be normal.\n\nBut don't compromise my friend! You will one day be loved for you!
2	Hey its me, from the other post and I think I may have some thoughts :\n\nYou know the reason I made my first post is because I had the feeling that some enfp qualities come off as feminine on men, which would be damaging on a guy, but totally awesome for a girl! Like being super passionate, loving, caring, fun, creative, intelligent. \n\nSpecially because most girls(specially observant instead of intuitive types) at least to me can be boring and superficial, specially if they are immature.\n\nAn ENTJ friend just posted a couple of days ago here how totally in love he is with his enfp girlfriend and how he loves how open she is to the relationship and doesn't hold back, because we guys are very afraid of moving too fast and appearing needy, which is a worry that I feel dissapears with enfp girls because they are so comfortable to be with.\n\nI feel like for us enfps when the other person shows too much interest instead of scaring us away, makes us like them more and want to invest more. \n\nSo for you girl, I do confidently believe your time will come, and if you want some advice of what you can do is try to look sexier. (and please I'm not trying to be misogynistic, never!) \nI personally love when a girl takes the time to look pretty, specially for a date, and I try to do the same! To Look my best, when I'm going out to meet new people too, and I find it gives me a lot of confidence in myself when I like how I look! \n\nSo find a style you like that makes you feel pretty and sexy and of course working out helps a lot too, to boost one's self image, but also is great for our enfp mental health, we need a little of order  to keep us in check, and getting a healthy habit helps us develop our Si, which makes us be an even greater version of ourselves! üòÑ <3<3\n
2	I went through basically the same thing all through high school. I supposed I was too weird for someone to want to date me. Their loss I think, cause my first year of college I found someone just as weird and wonderful and intriguing. \n\nYou're probably meeting just a lot of boring, shallow guys who wouldn't understand you anyway. You keep a look out and you'll find someone who's weird and wonderful, too. Get involved in things you love, go to new events, new adventures, and you're bound to run into someone great!
2	Hey there! Now, I won't say that I would be exactly the same if it was you that I met... But I certainly doubt it's about you being an ENFP.\nHere's my story (might restore some hope at least!)\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/ae42dc/so_i_need_to_pick_at_your_brains_for_research_and/?utm_source=reddit-android\n\n\n\nWithout saying that finding any ENTJ will solve your problems, I'd say that you shouldnt sell yourself short. I've spent approx 10 hours every day for 5 days straight talking with her, and I can't get enough.\n\n\n\n\nI'd actually advice you to read my post, and then decide if you want to read the rest of this comment or not. \n\n\n\n\n\nAre you sure? \n\n\n\n\n100%?\n\n\n\n\nOk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, I'd say that my studies in psychology and job as a "personality/character trainer" (not about MBTI, but personality in general) could be of some use for you if you want to see if that is it. From what you write here it sounds like you somehow act in a way that makes you seem like (forgive my bluntness) ... Well... A rebound/plaything. \n\nLet's assume that it is something you "do", or something about the way you act, or your character (if there is something, I'd rather put my money on that), that makes you uninteresting to people as a potential SO, then I'd be happy to talk with you and see if we can figure out the source.\nAssuming that it's something about you, and not the people you hang around... If it's the people you hang with, then I can't tell you much more than "do a spring-cleaning in your friend-closet, cause you have shitty friends".
2	I feel ya, mate. I always feel like even if at first people like my weird and quirky traits, it won't always last. How long can someone find weirdness endearing or cute? At the end of the day, it probably gets boring after a while for them to deal with my crazy ideas and odd requests.\n\nPlus, cute is nice, but hot is always better! And that is something I can't see myself being.
2	I can definitely relate. I‚Äôve read the multiple posts, read the ENTJ guys post that randomly (?) got linked here, and I think it all boils down to attachment style. NTs tend to be avoidant attachment style, which means they thrive on minimal attachments. As an ENFP, I have always found that I have an anxious attachment style and have historically have needed a lot of reassurance. Now, I‚Äôm not saying you can‚Äôt be an ENFP with an avoidant style, as certainly those exist, and boys/girls chase after them because they have this ‚Äúdon‚Äôt care, don‚Äôt need ya‚Äù demeanor (which is a cover up, btw...we all need connection of some kind..more on that later). \n\n\nSomething that I HAD to learn, and consequently, something that quelled my insecurities, was that IT IS OKAY to want connection. I never believed it was, and that made the problem worse. Those with avoidant attachment styles (again, not always NT types, but frequently they are avoidant) would reinforce the belief that my need for connection was not okay. My belief that my need for connection was ‚Äúwrong‚Äù got garbled and mistranslated and basically boiled down to me telling myself ‚ÄúI am not okay. Something is wrong with me.‚Äù Wrong. Our human need for connection is inherent, and it‚Äôs good..no matter how weirdly we may ask for our connection needs to be met! There are people out there who see your needs and their needs as good, and they are secure attachment style individuals. Go get one of them. They are probably sensors. Hahaha just kidding. In my experience that has been true, but I know securely attached intuitives exist. I just never dated any when I was younger. x.x\n\nEdit: to add on to what ENTJ guy is saying, maybe the part of us ENFPs that we need to optimize is just simply..being okay with ourselves and our needs. I think it‚Äôs one of the best ways we can improve. Peace out.
2	I just responded to another post with something similar to what I'll say here: just be yourself. Cliche but the thing is if you weird people out or are too much fir some that is ok, you are weeding out those who you don't belong with. It would never work with them so don't feet. If you are yourself you'll find someone who loves you for you, not a mask you put on. Because wearing a mask all the time is tiring.
2	Reading through the comments, it sounds like "I'm not gonna change for anyone!" is the anthem here, which is kind of the exact opposite of ENTJ logic (which is "always adapt, improve, perfect"). Over the years I've seen my sister pass up/push away so many good guys simply because she "shouldn't change who she is", when the things they bring up is, from my/their PoV, actual valid points that can be very bothersome in a relationship. And for some reason, my mom keeps telling her "you shouldnt change for anyone!" which is also bad in my mind.\n\nI've always tried to improve my weaknesses, train away bad habits, and downplay some of the sides of being an ENTJ (like the overly confidence spike we get in our mid-teens. If I hadn't, I'd be a fucking outcast, because it was WAY overboard for a period...). Why? Because they weren't doing any good, and dealing with them made me a much better person. I'd say if I hadn't, I'd might actually be a very unhealthy entj at the moment.\n\nI'm not saying you should do a complete make-over, or change things that are actually good (objectively, not subjectively), but my point is that you shouldn't lock yourself up with all the things that actually could be burning your bridges, or making you a harder person to be with (ironic coming from an ENTJ üòÇ). 
13	How in god's fuck does one stop doubting type?	Ok ok I hear me out.    \nI've recently gotten into Typology and I would say I've gotten pretty deep. However, I'm just really getting sick of me doubting my type. I'm going to assme this is a result of Extraverted Intuition. Every other few days or so I find myself finding the most **bullshit** reason I am xxxx type. If I can remember correctly I think i've debated whether I was, ENTP --> ENFJ --> ESFP --> INFP --> INFJ --> INFP --> ISTJ(Yeah I don't know how either) --> ENTP --> INFP --> ISFP --> ENTP --> ENTJ --> INTP --> INFP --> ENTP --> INFP--> ENTJ --> ESFJ --> Right back to INFP. I've come to the understanding that I will not fit into this neat little ENFP box and ahve realized I'm pretty close to the other NPs, but it seems somehow I still question it, then blow the situation up x100 and find myself literally bulldozing each and every source of information I can find until my mind gets the proof it needs to shut the absolute fuck up. I just ask, how do I turn it off or tune it down?  
10	I think you need to take a break from MBTI for a bit.\n\nWhat might be happening to you is similar to when you focus on a certain word for too long and it starts looking weird. Just walk away for a bit and clear your perspective.
5	read into function stacks. for long years I've been a noob that thought that entp are just like enfp, just entp are more "cold" or enfp are just like enfj, just lazier\n\nfunction stacks is much more set in stone and definite
3	I! COULD! HAVE! WRITTEN! THIS!\n\nJust the other day I changed my flair back to ENFP from ENTP because I started to doubt whether I used Ti over Fi\n\nMy journey: INFJ -> INFP -> learned about the functions + antidepressants -> ENFP -> ENTP -> ENFP\n\nOr something like that, idk. Probably more going back and forth between the same types. Actually, I‚Äôm sure that there was more going back and forth\n\nI am certain that I use Ne in there somewhere but I always get into this ‚ÄúBUT WHAT IF‚Äî‚Äú mindset where I suddenly doubt everything\n\nFrom what I‚Äôve heard, it‚Äôs not uncommon for Ne-doms to do this. Perhaps Ne-aux to a lesser extent
3	Haha I have a sister who is an ENFP and I even heard her say, when she initially got into typology, that she believes there are more than 16 types in the world- "There must be."\n\nSo something that helped with her, and might help with you, is that by doubting in this way shows you're an ENFP. Aside from the obvious that Ne has clearly been affecting you is to know a checklist of sorts:\n\n1. Do you believe in infinite possibilities(at least, perhaps, before you came to know typology)? If so, know that NO other type does this.\n2. Do you spend a month or two, at times, or maybe weeks, figuring out why you did something in the past- the specific reason? If so, this is evidence of the blind spot found in the 7th function. In an ENFP's case it's Ti, and while I don't know how deep in the rabbit hole you've gone with the functions allow me to say that the Introverted functions keep the Extroverted functions at bay. As Jung put it, the Introverted functions allow one to stand as a point of reference to judge the outside world, which is also why Fi and Ti are considered the "Rational" functions. If one allows the extroverted world to consume them than it leads to hysteria- Jung's words- as they are concerning the self with something outside their control. And I think in terms of checkpoints you got the hysteria down.\n3. "Gets the proof it needs to shut the absolute fuck up."---> That's Te- the need for evidence- talking, instead of trusting the self in terms of thought(Ti). Also, here's the thing about Te: it's based on locality. Similar to Fe, in that it consistently seeks outside itself, Te gets wrapped up into believing whatever they are exposed to if it comes from a valid source. The Thinking function is about how the world works, and for an ENFP that definition is constantly in flux. With NO grounding in subjectivity(except for personal values, Fi), the Te will constantly link up with Ne and -BOOM- one gets posts like this one. Also, in terms of their thought process, as there is no sense of accuracy(Ti) the ENFP will be a walking contradiction, like my sister saying "yes no" in the same sentence and then giving me a blank stare as if she has know idea why I'm getting upset because she "genuinely sees things from every side"(No Ti).\n\nAnother thing that one ought to know is that one cannot be confident of an extroverted function, it must come from an introverted function as it is you. When an ENFP believes they're stupid, gets offended when people doubt them when they explain something(Te), and then just crumbles when they make a bad decision, especially upon reflection...... There's no Ti. The ENFP is confident of their feelings, and while their feelings might go up and down- at least they're there. I say this part just as a way to say that I think you're doing fine with your typing, keep researching, but yeah maybe cool off a bit. You're not doing anything wrong, every type comes to know typology under different circumstances as each respective type experiences reality sooooo differently. BUCK UP CHAMP.\n\nI'll tell you what I tell my sister: the moment you stop doubting your thought process and stop contradicting yourself, the moment you stop seeing the infinite(outside of typology), and the moment you believe yourself without seeking outside input because you just know why you've done anything throughout your life... THAT is the moment when you questioning being an ENFP will be plausible; no sooner(but if it happens after 20 years than yeah, totally doesn't count). Again, no other type does these things, only an ENFP. And I'll also tell you what I tell my sister when she's freaking out... "Stop it."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOH.... and just FYI, as it seems it bothers A LOT of ENFPs, without Ti to support your function stack your Fe will run rampant; they're opposites. Ti is being impersonal to situations, and Fe is all about making others happy and ensuring they're okay...... And how does this phenomenon manifest? The lack of being impersonal causes an ENFP to need to be liked by others. YEAH, everyone wants to be liked, but not like this..... They want to make others happy, Fe, and wants to be liked because of it very often, no Ti.\n\n&#x200B;
2	MBTI types are fluid, so there's no need to ascribe a lot of value to it. I fall in between a few different types (INTP, ENFP, INFJ) depending on my mind state and how I present myself. The point is using MBTI to develop and to gain a bit of self-understanding but ultimately you probably are more like one type but not completely.
1	> I just ask, how do I turn it off or tune it down? \n\nENTPs like you can't chill unless they debated something to death even with themselves, right? I totally agree with /u/whatsappennin: give it some time. Typology is a journey.
1	Bro you need meditation. Gotta practice quieting that racing mind of yours :)
1	OMG that‚Äôs me üò≠\n\nI have been varying between ENFP, INFP and ENTP .. and I totally get what you‚Äôre saying with ‚ÄûWell AM I SURE ? I could also be xxx..!!‚Äú\n\nAt least I was always quite positive that I am N and P .. \n\nAnd Now reading all this I am quite sure I must be ENFP (Ne)\n\n
1	Bulldoze away. That's how I did it, in time, it becomes clear. You can proceed by elimination too. I see no xSFJ for example, so I guess you don't relate to SiFe ?\n\nBtw, your doubt are probably caused by how you define the functions. Maybe check out socionics for more info (and more credible than random online mbti stuff)\n\n
1	A few suggestions here:\n\n1. **Drop the self-administered tests.** They tend to be inaccurate when you're on the border. Instead, understand what each of the four dichotomies represent and decide for yourself where you lean. The following pages from Prelude Character Analysis provide very good explanations: [Extravert vs. Introvert](https://preludecharacteranalysis.com/explore/extravert-vs-introvert), [Sensing vs. Intuitive](https://preludecharacteranalysis.com/explore/sensing-vs-intuitive), [Thinking vs. Feeling](https://preludecharacteranalysis.com/explore/thinking-vs-feeling), [Judging vs. Perceiving](https://preludecharacteranalysis.com/explore/judging-vs-perceiving).\n2. **Understand the function stacks.**  Behind every four-letter combination is a **unique** set of preferred ways to engage with the world. They are ordered by frequency/ease of usage, collectively known as a "stack".  Even a single letter change (e.g. ENTP to ENFP, or INFJ to INFP) can result in a completely different stack, with different functions and orders. A good place to start understanding stacks is [www.typeinmind.com](https://www.typeinmind.com) \n3. **Ask others for input on how you "appear" to them.** Other people typically have a better gauge on how you come across to the world.  Once you've done 1 and 2 above, take your own hypotheses and validate them with close friends and family who understand you. For instance, you might show them the E vs. I page and confirm that you demonstrate the E traits more frequently. \n\nGood luck and have fun exploring!\n\n&#x200B;
1	Hey this article might help you. It describes how each function behaves based on it's positioning. Thus you can get a better handle on which functions you use in which position perhaps:\n\nhttps://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/12/how-each-cognitive-function-manifests-based-on-its-position-in-your-stacking/
4	Commons ENFP careers/career advice?	I‚Äôve finally decided on a major I think (classic ENFP) and I was curious what kind of jobs other ENFPs typically have. I don‚Äôt like being tied down to one thing (besides relationships), so I‚Äôm nervous about sticking with one career. I am currently on track for education and work as a science teacher at a museum. Any advice for a wandering soul that will make an ENFP feel content and confident? 
5	If it feels right keep doing it.  Don‚Äôt give up on things too easily, but don‚Äôt expect to know your exact direction in life.  I‚Äôm not sure how old you are, but I switched focuses four times in college before finishing with a degree in outdoor education.  My only cautionary note would be to major in something that DOES pay the bills.  Don‚Äôt just chase money, but the part of my degree I enjoyed most doesn‚Äôt pay enough to survive.  I don‚Äôt regret it, but I don‚Äôt use my degree at work, which in the grand scheme is a huge waste of money.  \n\nMostly though, you‚Äôre probably young and you have a lot of time to try many things.  Listen to what you enjoy and what you‚Äôre passionate about.  In my early to mid 20‚Äôs I thought I was running out of time.  Now as I get ready to enter 30 I‚Äôve found that all the life experiences I‚Äôve had have allowed me to get a lot of different jobs, and I‚Äôm a lot more confident in myself and direction I‚Äôm headed.\n\nYou‚Äôre in for some amazing formative years. Keep your heart open and you‚Äôre head up!  
1	I think the most important thing is to not seek validation from other people. I really struggle(d) with that growing up and in college (and I guess now sometimes too). I switched my major like 4 times. I graduated with a generic business degree. I‚Äôm now an Accounting intern, and I absolutely love it. I remember hearing how accountants are boring or how it sucks, and as an ENFP, I knew that I didn‚Äôt want to be boring or have a boring life, so I didn‚Äôt let myself step into that box. But in that time, I completely dismissed an entire field based on others‚Äô perceptions. So now I‚Äôm doing something I really like, in a field that‚Äôs probably not associated with ENFPs, but it suits me and that‚Äôs all that matters. My advice is to go out and shadow and try everything. Call up/email local businesses and ask to shadow them. Even if you think you may not like it. Who knows!! Go experience as much as possible so you won‚Äôt be left with the excuse of ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôd like this!‚Äù  \n\n\ntl;dr Your Myers Briggs isn‚Äôt an end-all, be-all to career. Choose for yourself; don‚Äôt listen to what others suggest you do. Go shadow tons of professionals and make the decision for yourself. You‚Äôll be way happier and in control that way. 
1	Hi!!!! So I‚Äôm a senior in college so it‚Äôs safe to say I have zero career experience, however, I do think I know what I want in my professional life. \n\nI am a business (marketing) major and had actually switched *from* management, because I thought it was too dry. I like open paths and endless creativity, where wit, humor and open minds can come together. I‚Äôm not sure about you, but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve set as my goals for a job. I love working with others and connecting people. Delegating, bossing and being very cut-to-the chase isn‚Äôt my thing, so I don‚Äôt really want a job like that. \n\nI believe that knowing what you what, what works best with your personality, and what makes you happy will give you the best reward at the end of the day when it comes to your career. \n\nI have no idea if that helps but I thought I‚Äôd at least try!!! :) 
6	Seeking Authenticity	For most of my life, I'd struggled with being me. I was too hyper, too soft, or carefree, or didn't follow the guideline of what a man or an adult should be, and was constantly told so. It crushed my self worth and esteem, and with it the anxiety and depression and misery came. \n\nI want to be stronger, more established, but I don't want to lose my heart, or myself in the process. I've never known what it means to be worth something. Alcohol and other things help me turn off that switch, whether it's anxiety or my need to help the hurt and suffering. Trying to manage it all, it was too much, and I lost everything and ended in jail without a dollar in my pocket. I'm exhausted but I refuse to give up. \n\nIf you've read this far, thank you. I currently work at a hotel, and this job makes me miserable. I joined it because it was the only place that called me, but also because I could help and care for people. This place has tried to teach me how to pretend to care for our customers and to be something fake and uncaring. No one here values anyone or anything except the highest paying customer, or what status they have, and I loathe screwing people, and helping the powerful be more powerful, and them knowing they have money, can throw us around. It's been like this all my life, everywhere, and the only place that hasn'tbeen like that has been the military.\n\nHow can you be authentic, but still be highly productive, successful, and function? I want to be there one day, and I want to be proud of being who I am for once. I want to be the happy ENFP, and human, that you guys are
1	Read about halo effect. Its the thing that makes people see you in biased, overhyped way. Romantic guys for example: one is branded a creep and other a romeo for doing EXACT SAME SHIT. \n\nObviously the things that turn on the halo switch are something along the lines of: good looks, charisma, high energy, success.\n\nI had good looks and bad grades. So looks and negative success. People from my Uni would tease and dislike me, while people from my dorm would love me
1	How would you know that you are being "you"?
4	Anyone have minimalistic tendencies?	I hate having stuff. Like a lot. I try to keep 2 pairs of pants, 5 t-shirts, 2 pairs of shoes (not counting my Chacos of course) and just really hate stuff. I try to keep my life simple and don't want things over experience. I feel like our draw towards human connection could mean there's more me's out there, lemme know!
3	Haha I'm the total opposite I'm a hoarder, I like to have many options and I never know if something will ever become useful in the future, but I get what you mean I wouldn't like to have too many of some stuff, and what I actually end up using day to day is 0.10% of what I own 
3	Everything I own including my clothes can fit into my backpack and you would just think I am a college guy with a backpack. I love the idea of being able to pick up at the drop of a hat and go anywhere. I would want to appear as a simple and modest person on the outside but have storehouses of creativity and richness inside of me. To me, being minimalist allows maximum creativity and opportunity
2	Yes! I get rid of stuff when I feel like there's too much. Whenever I visit my parents house I go through everything and throw away things that are not needed. I feel as though when my parents get older they've been hoarding more stuff. They never notice whatever that it is that I've thrown away. I really just like the look of a clean room. I think it's because I have so many thoughts in my head that a clean space helps reduce the noise in my head. 
2	I‚Äôm somewhere in the middle\n\nI have a moderate amount of things and frequently give things away when I realize that I don‚Äôt use them\n\nI have some collections. I have a box of gemstones‚Äîno idea how many I have at this point and some are too big for the box‚Äîand 12 succulents
1	I do. But I'll have lots of *something* if I need lots of it. So clothes are such for me that I need many different coz I like to stylish myself. Other things tho, keep 'em to minimum. I generally don't like photos, pictures, unpractical gifts that just lay around, I don't have a TV (nor will I ever want to), and I definitely don't do things like collecting vinyls or CDs or books - I'd rather DJ with digital files and read on a Kindle.
1	Ha We discussed this on intj you might find the answers amusing\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/af5i2r/anyone_here_wear_the_same_everyday/?utm_source=reddit-android
24	Trying to be all things to all people	Naturally as a lot of ENFPs are, I find myself constantly wanting to improve myself and the ideal self that I aspire to be slightly alters with each bit of information I pick up. At this point it's almost like trying to swim to the moon. I want to be this multifaceted and complex creature that is mysterious yet inviting. A person of complex ideas but who gets enjoyment out of simple tasks. \n\nThere's this phrase in the Bible about this person named Paul describing himself as wanting to be "all things to all people" and I feel like that is what I am aspiring to do. 
6	Yep, I feel this deeply too. There's a great quote in a Stephen Covey book I read- Something along the lines of trying to be all things to all people and exhausting yourself into meaning nothing to anyone. I don't have a real answer for this other than-try to protect yourself from burnout. Boil it down to what you know of who you are and work from there. ENFP's want to master everything and very well might get good at a lot, but ultimately we're all created with unique gifts that we should utilising. \n\nAt the same time, you're an ENFP for a reason, maybe it's not so bad that you want to aspire to bigger and better things. Just don't put the pressure on yourself to do it all now, and all at once. By the sounds of things, and statistically if you're a pretty textbook ENFP, there's a fair chance you're an enneagram 7. Have a look into that - it might give you a bit more insight into the 'everything, now' struggles that we deal with!\n\nEph 4:1 also has a bit to say about Paul and what he thinks about life, keen to hear your thoughts. 
3	I like feeling useful, but at a certain age it became too much.  Sure, I have the skills to be all things to all people, but I don't HAVE to be all things to all people anymore.  People can ask me when they need help. 
3	One can't be all things to all people for that requires perfect Fe and perfect Ti.\n\nNo humans have perfect Fe and perfect Ti, even the _ _ FJs and _ _ TPs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo instead be yourself, accept yourself with all your flaws, and be yourself while also being kind, generous, benevolent^1, practicing loving-kindness^1, compassion^2, empathetic joy^3, and an even soul^4 / even mind / equanimity.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI am pretty sure as a *former Christian* üòâ that Paul himself puts this into words.  We can't be all things to all people, we just literally can't, and that is why according to him^(Paul in Romans) we are justified by faith and we are saved by faith.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqkaBEWPH18\n\nBlah, blah, blah Greek words that share the same roots but there are different versions of, blah blah, blah CHARIS as in grace, blah blah blah more Greek words as in EUCHARIST as in thanksgiving, blah blah blah CHARA as in joy / gladness / source of joy, for once we unburden ourselves and recognize our limitations but how we can be saved by other people, it is only then can we be joyous, only then can we acknowledge grace, only then can we be thankful. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n>At this point it's almost like trying to swim to the moon.\n\nAs Robert Browning said in a poem once before.\n\n>...\n\n>*Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp,* /\n\n>***Or what's a heaven for?*** *All is silver-grey,*  ...
10	Lost what to do in a situation I don‚Äôt want to be in	Laying out a but of backstory then ill get into it\n-been working with a family startup company for 7 years, doing a bunch of things from 3d modeling, videos, articles, benchmarks, illustrations. \n-worked with the company in high school, loved the work at first and believed in the products. My passion has dwindled over the years.\n-no money has been made in the 7 years i have worked with them. Currently my parents fund my bosses living expenses and my living expenses. \n-been bouncing around projects for the past 7 years, not releasing anything. There have been close moments, very close, but nothing has gotten to market.\n-after graduating college in may, went to china for 5 months to work with the company in person. My boss, his wife, and son. I lived with them as their 4th rm. They have an office but we worked out of the apartment, would‚Äôve taken months to get ready to work in the office.\n-the past 5 months have been the most stressful of my life. Their family was in a failing marriage and my boss has said that he really wanted me to come to china with a large factor of needing someone else to help their marriage. Living there was painful. My boss was diagnosed with Aspergers and has a very forceful personality. An engineer at heart, and extremely particular with everything and everyone. Not the direct cause, but was stormed to and screamed at for missing a spot while cleaning a pot. Every day was some sort of shouting match with someone in the household. The first couple of months, there would be fights so bad my boss or his wife would storm out and leave, not talking for days. She would regularly stay at another place for a while. And these fights would start from tiny things. One of them was because they couldn‚Äôt agree on what internet package to choose and she left for 2 days and he went out to get drunk. Didn‚Äôt witness anything physical but said that in the past it has happened. It got better over time, fights didn‚Äôt last as long, big fights happened once a month vs every week, and things were picking up socially. Still huge amounts of passive-aggression when i left, basically every conversation. Before visiting i had planned to stick along for a while but now... i want out.\n\nEverything in my body is telling me to get out of this situation. I mirror what i am around, probably too much and it has caused me to lose a sense of self, but i do not want to be in the situation. I picked up on the passive aggressiveness which is something i did not do beforehand, and my temper has gone way up since the events. My boss keeps trying to change to make me want to be happy in the situation but all i want is out. He wants to be in a master/apprentice style with me, but i want to go back to school and actually pay attention in class and pick up what i learn. I told him i dont want the master/apprentice lifestyle and he said go prove that there is a better/different way, and if i cant prove it isnt the best way than there is something wrong with me/him/our relationship. \n\nIm going back to live with them, planning for 6 months and in the hopes of financial independence and helping get the ball rolling with the company so that if i leave, another person could pick up where i left off. I dunno what im asking or saying, just needed to get my situation into writing. Im clueless what to do. I hate that i sound like im having the opportunity of a lifetime but complaining about it. This just isnt what i want to do and i feel im wasting the opportunity for someone who wants this lifestyle. I want to be done with the entrepreneurial way of life. Just want to focus on what I personally as a person want to focus on.\n
2	ENFP intuition is a bitch.  If you want to get out that bad, I'd say listen!!!!  As someone who was raised by people like that and ended up in a lot of relationships like that when I was younger, they usually only escalate without intervention, hard work, and therapy. 
2	>no money has been made in the 7 years i have worked with them. Currently my parents fund my bosses living expenses and my living expenses.<\n\nWhat are you doing? If it's negatively affecting your mental health, you're supporting this unstable 'mentor' AND you're making no money for 7 years THEN LEAVE. Am I missing something here? Is it not obvious to you? As a fellow ENFP I wish you good luck. Take the initiative and assert yourself as the director of your own life.
1	Bail. It doesn't actually matter what lifestyle (master/apprentice) your boss thinks you should have. If you think you should have a life that is financially sustainable, progressing in your education, and without regular shouting matches, then leave. 
88	Do ENFP males have to hide who they are in order to get/keep girls?	I've been thinking about stop being myself around girls, cause up till know it has only hurt me. I tend too appear too enthusiastic, which makes the girl think I like them way more than I do, and that they can walk all over me.\n\nOr I've been told by them that they feel so comfortable with me as their friend that they dont want to try becoming something else for fear of it eventually ending.\n\nClose friends female and male have always told me that I shouldn't try to change who I am, that Im a nice guy and a gentleman, funny, interesting, super fun to be around and all that nice shit they say about ENFPs, and if she can't see that or appreciate it, or show the same interest and respect I show for her, she just don't deserve me.\n\n But as much as I love hearing that, I don't know if its true, cause in my experience, being myself just doesn't work.\n\nId like to hear the success stories that you've guys had (if you've had them) were you just were your self and it worked, and what type was she? I've kinda lost faith that Ill meet "the one" that likes me for being me. thanks! much love always.\n\nUpdate: hey guys I wanna say thanks! that your comments really helped me and I feel a thousand times better about myself and I love you all that much more!! I decided that even though I may have to tone down a bit, I shouldnt try to fake being someone that I'm not, and just be more direct with my intentions from the beginning of meeting a girl I'm interested in, but also not try too desperately to look for a relationship, yes, get myself out there and meet new people, but primarily focus on my own self improvement first, and relationships shouldn't be forced, it should happen naturally. <3 hope this post helped a lot more of people than just me! 
59	I'm an enfp guy. A lot of girls seem put off by my enfp-ness (lol) but a lot of girls also tend to find my hyperactivity and weird, fleeting interests cute. For whatever reason most girls who like me tend to be very intelligent. The more ditsy ones tend to think I'm weird and that I talk too much.  I had a happy relationship with an entp in highschool but we broke it off when we both left for different colleges. I am in my second year of college now and have had a few flings (had a nice few weeks with an intp but she got very into me and it scared me away because I have commitment issues) but its really challenging to find someone who I feel comfortable being myself with. I've found that women in general find me very fun to be around though, so don't lose hope! Just keep being you, but try to reign it in just a bit when meeting new people so that you don't scare them away, then after you are acquainted and more comfortable with one another you can fully unleash  your enfpness, potentially in more ways than one! 
18	My husband is an ENFP, I‚Äôm an INFJ and we have been together for 8 years. We met at church through his cousin/my roommate. He‚Äôs always been himself and has never hidden it. I wouldn‚Äôt want him to pretend to be someone else! He‚Äôs a good man, outgoing and very loving. Just be yourself. 
15	Don‚Äôt let yourself fall into the nice guy trap. Seriously.\n\nThe best thing you can do is be a direct communicator. If you like someone, tell them. Let them know that you‚Äôre a personality type that is easily excited, and you want to share experiences with them on that level, get to know them intimately, see how things would go. If they don‚Äôt want that, then let them know that‚Äôs fine, and move on. Don‚Äôt let the ‚Äúfriend zone‚Äù idea get to you. It‚Äôs easy to lament and turn into a self pitying schlub (especially because ENFPs are so emotional in general.) Do not let yourself.\n\nENFPs are typically charming, so it can often work out with a bunch of people. Explore!\n\nBut as another poster said, I think eventually you may end up settling down with an intelligent person. I married an INTP fairly young and we‚Äôre still very much in love, despite some bumps in the road here or there.
29	No I think being an ENFP makes it easier with women. It sounds like you just need to actually flirt more. Also are you talking about online dating/texting or just interactions in general face to face? 
28	As an ENFP male that's been in a committed relationship for 5 years, the answer is: "no, you don't have to hide who you are'. \n\nTldr: Self-esteem is both sexy and necessary to truly love someone else, but also remember that no one is perfect.\n\n\nMy GF actually approached me my senior year of high school asking if I'd like to go to prom with her. I just graduated university in Dec and she graduates from a different university in May. We spent 4 of those 5 years in a long distance relationship (only 2 hours apart, but that still meant I'd only get to see her about once of month). \n\n\nThat being said, "the one" is bullshit. Soulmates are bullshit. When you put someone (I don't care who) on that high of a pedestal, they are going to fall and you both end up hurt for it. NO ONE is perfect. I'm sorry if that seems harsh, but if you think that someone will come into your life that is perfect (maybe you don't think this way and if so, just ignore this section) then you are setting yourself up for failure and I'd hate to think that you might.\n\n\nLastly, and this is something I've had extensive discussions with my therapist about, the saying "you can't love someone else before you learn to love yourself" is true. I've been in your position before and I wasn't a big fan of myself (and if you're asking about changing who you are, I assume the same from you), until I decided to try fixing my self-confidence by myself. I was tethering myself with co-dependancy (my self worth = what someone else thought about me). Since no girl seemingly loved me, why should I love myself? I started living for me... and less than 3 months later, a girl I paid barely any attention to (she says we sat at the same table in study hall the prior semester, but I legit have no memory of her being there) asked me to prom and I decided to say yes because I thought it'd be a safe bet. If we last, great! If we break up by the end of the week, at least I can say I've had a girlfriend in high school. 5 years later, she's my world and I'm just waiting on the money to buy her an engagement ring. \n
13	Hi! INFJ female here who's been talking to an ENFP male every single day since we first met at the end of October (pretty long distance, met at a mutual friends party)!\n\nThe thing that makes me the happiest about talking to him and feeling so connected is when he shows his appreciation for the fact that I don't judge him, and he feels like he can be as enthusiastic as he wants to be. Whereas with other people in general he sometimes feels like he needs to turn it down.\n\nI love his enthusiasm, even as someone who is more reserved at times but also just as enthusiastic :)\n\nI also just admire his ability to want to be himself at all times!! Coming from someone who is more of a social chameleon. Not to say that I am not genuine or am "fake", but just speaking to Fe and my admiration for Fi. He has great, consistent characteristics and comes off as comfortable, confident and emotionally intelligent.\n\n\nI think this might not happen with all types... But to me it's important because I feel if someone were to hide who they were or tone things down, I would notice it right away! \n\n\n
10	Stay authentic my friend. Be the best version of yourself. 
9	No. Love yourself and own who you are. I can assure you that there will be women who‚Äôll be attracted to you. Next, love yourself more and open yourself up to the world. 
9	>I tend too appear too enthusiastic, which makes the girl think I like them way more than I do, and that they can walk all over me.\n>\n>they feel so comfortable with me as their friend that they dont want to try becoming something else for fear of it eventually ending.\n\nI feel like both types of girls that would do these things to you aren't very considerate about you in the first place. Take it as a filter for people you aren't compatible with?\n\nI'm an INFP. Broke with with my ex-ISTP after several years of dating in the summer. Not a ton of experience dating but I wanted to try opening up my heart.\n\nMet an ENFP online five months ago online and dear god he caught me so off guard. He kissed me within the first half hour of our first date and kept me pretty flustered all night. Talk about enthusiasm!\n\nI will admit it put me on reserve mentally after we spent the night together. Without my prompting he reassured me that he didn't think of me as just a fling. After I went home we kept talking and clicked so much that he made it official with me by the third date.\n\nThe right person will love your enthusiasm and personality so long as you respect them as well. 
7	I can relate to this so much, as an enfp male. \nI think we‚Äôre just a rare pick. But I‚Äôd rather not change my whole personality for someone else. Even if there has been times I wanted to. 
6	lol ENFP chick and I get the same from dudes. 
6	Hey man, fellow ENFP male here. \n\nI have a story that recently happened that applies to this! \n\nAll of my past relationships I tried changing myself to be the man that the woman I was with wanted me to be. It wasn‚Äôt until recently I realized that‚Äôs why a lot of my relationships failed, or ended with me in heartbreak. At the end of the day the real you is going to come out regardless right? \n\nI had given up, but decided that for the next time I‚Äôd try being myself and see how it works. Wound up finding someone who actually liked me for me! Granted, we had to break up due to other issues (not related to us at all) but it felt wonderful to have someone like me for me. \n\nDon‚Äôt give up! ‚ÄúThe one‚Äù is out there, but you‚Äôre not going to find them if you‚Äôre not yourself! My friends say the same thing ‚Äúdon‚Äôt change yourself‚Äù. If you find yourself having trouble transitioning from ‚Äúfriend‚Äù to ‚Äúmore than friends‚Äù than maybe she‚Äôs not the one for you. Good luck! 
8	**Possible unpopular opinion coming**  \nFirst I would like to say that on average, being an ENFP generally leads to more dates rather than none.\n\nSecond, while most of us here are ENFP, we are all widely different people, and our ENFPness can come across in different ways.\n\n**But my unpopular opinion is: maybe,** though hiding or repressing is certainly not healthy**.** Look, if you want to make friends, you have to practice being a good communicator. If you want to make strides as say, a manager, then you have to understand work behaviors and communication styles. If you want to get past decades old family dynamics that are hurtful, you have to experiment with ways of bringing up difficult conversations. \_The same holds true in dating and romantic relationships\_. Your personality is not infallible because love is involved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can certainly find a significant other without doing this work. My twin brother has a long term girlfriend and yet does not work on himself or his relationship at all. He's also a hopeless romantic. But he has also told me of the many very difficult flaws in his relationship as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**When it comes down to it, learning about good communication skills within the context of dating is not bad, it's healthy.** You begin to understand fundamental relationship dynamics, become better at communicating your feelings, and you establish strong foundations for your relationship to help make it last.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not saying to run over to /r/seddit and become a PUA. I'm just suggesting that its worth investing in your communication skills, and be mindful of how you present yourself. The same advice someone would get for work or home or friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n...also I'm sorry but as an ENFP, many ENFPs drive me nutty sometimes because I don't feel heard in conversations, or their energy is offputting, or they are distracted, and I have heard these same criticisms thrown my way. These are all issues I continue to work on as I become a more mature version of myself, and a more mature ENFP **<3**
6	You gotta ask yourself. Do you want to be uncomfortable the rest of your life by faking it or do you want to be in a relationship you enjoy? Stop putting so much pressure on trying to make it happen. This way they will come to you. 
6	I found that I have to be very forward with my intentions before getting to know the girl. I used to just get to know her and then decide if I liked her, but I found myself friend-zoned every time. I learned that if I thought a girl was pretty/cool I needed to give social queues that say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm interested‚Äù and try to make it clear you would like to get to know her for that reason by asking her to dinner or coffee or something. As far as being too open and friendly, just remember to keep the charm but also be cool. It‚Äôs ok to be super relatable and interested, but do it in a self-possessed way that makes you not seem dependent on her for attention. We ENFP‚Äôs are gifted with charm (maybe a bit *too* much) and sometimes you have to control it if you want to get something!
5	Depends. \n\nThe few girls I actually find intetesting and would want a part reship with usually use me for who I am . \n\nI tried a few things out and if I show dominant high status behavior/bodylanguage I can get most girls at least interested. But since I am not interested in such shallow relationships I don't take it further. \n\nIn short if you want to find a good partner be the best version of yourself (and keep working on yourself but on a natural level not in order to please  others )
4	Just want to throw my thoughts into the ring here. I peeped your post history, I was curious how old you are. Couldn‚Äôt figure that out tho but I did see something else.\n\nIt seems like you‚Äôve talked to a lot of girls and it all either ends in ghosting or ‚Äúfriendzoning‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôm going to be honest with you. Stop trying. Never in my experience, or any of my friends, have we really found people we‚Äôve dated because we were trying to date.\n\nInstead, focus on yourself and your friends. ENFPs are magnetic. People come to us, I promise you. Join some clubs. Go out on the weekends. If you and a girl start texting, just focus on being her friend. If you catch feelings, invite her to do friend things with other friends. That‚Äôs a comfortable setting to see if she might reciprocate. BUT don‚Äôt go into those evenings with expectations. Just go in hoping to have a good time. \n\nTbh with you, from my personal experience, I met my long term SO when i wasn‚Äôt even trying to. I just thought he was cute and wanted to hang out. So we started in a group hanging out. And slowly it became just the two of us hanging out. He‚Äôs an istp.\n\nI find I‚Äôm approached and usually crushed on by guys more when I‚Äôm in a relationship. The dynamic of an enfp not trying to impress anyone is easy to fall for. ENFP males are a rare breed, never change.
5	I'm dating an ENFP, he's the sweetest and sunniest boy you'll ever meet - and I love him so much for that (among many other things). Maybe it's harder for you to find someone who will appreciate your qualities fully. It'll be worth the wait when it happens though, I'm sure :) I can't see how hiding who you truly are would pay in the long term if you manage to "attract" someone. 
5	I can relate to all of this, without a doubt everything you've just said has happened to me at some point, but I'd like to add that the aspects of my ENFP personality that aren't traditionally considered masculine such as being emotionally sensitive and ambitious actually has proven to be very attractive to girls. Especially ones who've previously dated guys who were very much the opposite of me, so hearing that for some girls I'm a great person they'd want to be with has certainly boosted my confidence in dating again.
5	Uhhm. I don't really know. I guess that I tend to suppress how "enthusiastic" I am around girls, just so I don't seem so childish. I think I'm a lot more mellowed out now anyway, so it's pretty easy to just be laidback and vibe w other people instead of trying to put up a facade of myself. But if you want to know if dating can be successful as an enfp male, yes, it can, i've had relationships. :)
4	This isn't technically what they were saying but don't listen to the people who tell you that you shouldn't try to change. That isn't what life is about. If you're not actively trying to change yourself then you'll never grow out of the terrible habits that you developed while you were too naive to know better.\n\nIf you're having a difficult time with women (or just in the dating scene in general), then maybe it is a fault of your own. It's not an easy thing to admit nor is it a pleasant experience to go through, but that's why people don't live up to their potentials. It's because transcending your own shortcomings is difficult. People have a set of beliefs or structures that they employ to get them through life which you often regard as the state of reality, and failure is the challenge (or shattering) of those structures which prompts a reassessment and reapproach. This applies to everything in life, including dating. I think that *everyone* (not just ENFPs) need to get out there and start acting in ways that both convey who they truly are and provide the possibility of terrifying failures because it will provide crucial insights into the parts of you that you might need to change but are simply blind to. In regards hiding who you are, I say bollocks to suppressing parts of yourself to the appeasement of others. Unless you're a psychopath, in which case you already won't have a problem with being offensive, then I'd say that everyone could stand to live a little more for themselves to the possibility of offending someone else. If someone is constantly basing their decisions based upon what they think others won't judge them for rather than what they truly believe, then they are not doing themselves justice as an individual.\n\nThe reason why I know this is because I hadn't had any success stories until about a month ago. Any time I've dated someone before my current dating partner (we're not official), it was due more to coincidence or will of the other person rather than intent on my part. It's recently come to my attention that my increasing rate of failure in the last couple of months is not because of any external causes, rather the terrible presuppositions that I held and their failure to bring me to my goal. I have a suspicion that this problem is particularly prevalent for male ENFPs, but I found that I was too high in agreeableness to really go out and get the things that I wanted. This was especially true when it came to women. I justified it as being gentlemanly and nice but in reality, it was just cowardice. It was especially painful to come to that conclusion, but it was true. Every time I met someone that I was romantically interested in, I would refrain from physical flirtation out of fear of offending, out of a fear that I wasn't worthy and would be told no. I would befriend them first - which was a failure to convey my true intentions - and therefore put myself in the friendzone. I told myself it was because I wanted to ensure companionship before I transitioned into a sexual relationship, which, in all honesty, is a noble cause for refrain, but it failed to recognize reality - my own approach to relationships continued to fail me and required changing and that my holding out for 'the one' was really just a veiled excusing of these shortcomings. This is especially scary now with the rise of the Me Too movement and all that jazz, but there is a difference between flirting with someone you're interested in and stopping if they claim sexual disinterest versus a continuation despite their expressed demands. And this doesn't mean that physical flirtation has to be explicitly sexual and aggressive, it just needs to be present and executed properly.\n\nThe thing about relationships is that quirks tend to increase attraction rather than decrease it. People find quirks cute, but only when romantic prospects have already been established. Therefore you won't have to change yourself if you approach a new relationship in the right way because there is nothing inherently wrong with those minute beings of character. The only thing that might require changing is the way that you approach these relationships in the beginning. This is why it's so important to put yourself out there. Are you having difficulty starting a new relationship? Why? Maybe you're not meeting enough people. Go out and meet some people then. Does approaching strangers you don't know intimidate you? All the more reason to tackle that area of UNexpertise. You can't get better at something if you don't get out there and fail at it first. You're going to be abysmal at something you're new to. Children don't watch people walk for long periods of time and then suddenly know how to do it. They try and fall and bruise themselves and try again. It's the same with interpersonal relationships. Failure in intimacy is most often spawned from a mere lack of exposure. Unless it's delivered unto you, in which case you REMAIN lacking in that part of life, you can't get better until you're willing to fail. That's why you need to get out there and realize how many people there are on this planet. A failed with one relationship is not the end of the world because you can so easily transition that energy into the beginnings of another. When you voluntarily subject yourself to these things, you realize that you are bigger than the fears that you have and that overcoming them is what makes you STRONG as an individual. \n\nSorry for the rant, I hope some of that made sense. Please dispute me if you disagree with anything or let me know if you have any questions about my ramblings
3	Don‚Äôt change your behavior - part of our appeal is our genuine interest in most things and our authenticity. My friend once told me that I didn‚Äôt need to have ‚Äúgame‚Äù to pick up chicks ( I had been curious if I could still pick up chicks). He basically said it doesn‚Äôt matter for me because I can just make friends with anyone and that works better than any sort of weird, thought out flirting/mating/attraction technique to try and get girls.\n\n But, I will say, my over-enthusiasm has shot me in the foot. It‚Äôs easy to overshare with someone you just met/just started talking to - try to not over share or speed past certain milestones in conversation because you feel so comfortable talking to a new girl. Either they don‚Äôt care or think you‚Äôre catching feelings too quick, or both, neither of which seem to be good things. Then you never hear from them again lol.
3	Speaking as a guy who's been in a long-term relationship with my ENFP girlfriend, and as a person with many ENFP friends, I think that there're multiple aspects to this.\n\nA large part of it is that society has certain expectations around the concept of "man" and "woman". (We might talk a lot about "toxic masculinity" but I don't believe for a second that any woman would actively seek out milksops totally lacking in male aggression). \n\nI think a fair characterisation of that societal image of a man can be described along "*STJ" lines: strong, dutiful, stoic, money where his mouth is, and quite importantly - disagreeable in temperament (this is somewhat related to aggression and antipathy in males).\n\nNow - whether by a stroke of misfortune or not - ENFP males just happen to be temperamentally at odds with that fundamental idea of a man. The very construct of your personality aligns you guys more with the ethos of women than with men: kind, agreeable, compassionate, loving etc. \n\nOne solution to this of course is to find partners who do in fact appreciate those personality traits in intimate relationships. (Off the top of my mind I'm thinking of April Ludgate and Andy from Parks and Recs.) Find friends who appreciate those traits in groups, whether they come from men or women. Be honest about who you are and build a community around you that appreciates you for you, rather than pretend to be a caricature that you're not.\n\nBtw - some individuals that I think have found success as men BECAUSE of their ENFP-ness are Russell Brand and Will Smith.
3	I have tried acting "tough" in the past but it mostly was just me being insecure and covering it up. Nowadays I tend to embrace the insecure/awkward aspects of me and people seem to react positively to it. It damn sure is better for myself.
3	Nope, I‚Äôve been with my lovely lady for 3 years and she likes me just the way I am
3	Don't do it.
3	I've heard ENFP males tend to mature late, and my own experience confirms this.\n\nFirst, the good news: my ISTJ wife and I celebrated 10 years of mawwiage last August. We've known each other 11 and one half years.\n\nThe bad news: I sucked at being a friend to any female, any friend, not just romantic, when I was younger, up until my mid-20s.\n\nBut the change was also a bit of a lightswitch change: at one point I still sucked at being a friend, I wasn't confident in who I was, I sought validation from others, I was clingy and cloying and weird, and 3 weeks later I was quite a bit different and 3 weeks after that I met the girl I'd marry.\n\nI think my personal problems were over thinking others responses to my actions and words, not getting hints, being too much of a chameleon, and probably a few other things.\n\nThe catalyzing event was being the third wheel on my first trip out of the country, from California to Italy, getting separated from the other couple early in the trip, then spending 2 weeks by myself in and around Venice. (yes, it was pretty much awesome, but included a good deal of panic right about where we got separated. I spent New Years in the Eternal City and spent it not seeing the city or the massive party at all).\n\nI spent the time writing. Not Journaling, but writing, and and watching people (it was after the tourist season) and walking about. And I guess the things that changed about me were that I was OK with myself now, I am confident in who I am.
3	You need to try having sex with them instead of forever being their friend and your problems will stop
3	Not every girl (or person) is going to like the real you. But that's ok. That just weeds out the people you're not supposed to be with because it would never work. Be yourself and find those that love you for you.
3	Dude, as ENFPs (yep, I'm one too), we practically have dating super-powers. We're enthusiastic about life, genuinely interested in people, capable of being incredibly charming, can read people like a book and know how build a genuine, real human connection with another person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust relax into yourself, be calm, in the moment, and confident with who you are with no apologies for being you. The off putting hyper enthusiasm we sometime exude, I think, often comes from situational nervousness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPractice mindfulness for a bit of general grounding and becoming more comfortable in the moment and with who you are and just learn to let things flow. Get good sleep and do some exercise to burn of some of that extra energy we so often have spilling all over the place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd flirt ... learn how to flirt. We are brilliant at it!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm in my mid 40s and have been in long term relationships my entire adult life. Trust me, as ENFPs, we have some real advantages in that area and can definitely make that side of our lives work.
6	Seriously don't. I don't know about you but trying to change my behaviour would end up in such a mess mainly because being ENFP is so much me. I would always be in contrast with myself and this would probably end up in more failures and attracting girls that don't meet my standards. So dude. Be yourself no matter what and be proactive! \n\nI have reached the conclusion that it's better to die single than to be with a not-my-first-choice-but-i'll-have-to-settle-girl
4	Jesus, this is sad because I'm in the same boat. However, they way I've interpreted how girls see me is that I'm too flirty when I'm honestly just being friendly. I think a lot of girls steer clear of me thinking I'm a player. What's even worse is that I was raised by mostly women so I've always felt more comfortable confiding in them and simply being friends with them. But, having a female friend has been rare and if I do make one, it doesn't last long, maybe because of misinterpreted feelings on their end.\n\nSo, as of now, I'm trying not to focus on dating. Maybe I'll cross paths with a girl who is comfortable with my ENFP qualities and it'll all be effortless.

2	ENFP(M)(28) here. I have had many relationships, although I would say we all were going our different ways. Out of all of them really only two never tried to change or be bothered by my enthusiasm. One thought because of what I was like, I could do anything. The other, was asked why they haven't tamed me, or tried to mellow me out. Her response was that any kind of behavioral adjustment would just ruin me.\n\nBoth of these relationships were with INTJs...I kinda have a thing for hard working pouty girls who know get their way.\n\nSo don't change who you are, the ones that are worth it see the value in your authenticity.
2	If someone doesn't like who you truly are, why would you want to be with them?\n\nBut I'm gay so being quirky and artsy and silly might be perceived differently
2	I think I know exactly where you're coming from - and a lot of what you're saying echos my feelings 20-25yrs ago (I'm nearly 40 now). I don't have a solution, and my personal experience I've come to learn isn't necessarily typical - as I married young and fortunately my wife grew to love who I really was (vs the person that she thought I was when we met) during our first couple of years together (this year will make 20yrs that we've been together).  That said, here's my story, which I believe has some similarities with yours so perhaps will let you know that you're not alone and that there is definitely hope. No need to rush - just have fun and it will come.\n\nIn high school, I always found it difficult to actually get into romantic relationships.  As others have advised you, "don't fall into the nice guy trap" - and it is apparently really easy for us to do... But I didn't know this back then (hell, I didn't even know what an ENFP was) and so I was generally aloof when I liked someone, was overly shy, was overly concerned about messing something up and so often avoided trying anything, emotionally invested quickly, didn't realize I was being 'overly nice', etc. I never had the least bit of problem forming very close long term relationships with females, multiple of which actually started out after discovering that they'd had a crush on me previously - but then without knowing it, I'd friendzone myself. I later realized that folks aren't mind readers, and don't like to wait around for you to work up courage slowly, and so you wind up just becoming platonic friends after the initial attraction is replaced with familiarity - this is just how we work biologically and psychologically. I also learned that just because your intentions may be pure that everyone will interpret them as such.\n\nAs a result of some personal/family issues my 2nd half of high school, I found myself facing a lot of life stuff - one of which was a change of schools. Once at my new school, I kind of realized that I could remake myself and actively sought out to do so. Part of this process was just not caring about "being in a relationship" so much - as others have suggested, just focus on being the best you and having a good time.  I found that this seemingly helped my 'marketability' a bit - folks like people who are comfortable, who have depth, and who are having fun, so more folks tend to want to hang out, which exposes you to more opportunities for friendship and possibly romance.\n\nNow for the 'controversial' part of my tale (not really, but). Part of my decidedly not caring about being in a relationship as much was also coming to the realization that some of the things that many people want from a relationship could be found without being in a long term relationship (e.g. intimacy). I also picked it up in my head somewhere along the way that while many females of course often do want a nice guy, they're often not attracted to "too nice" of a guy (perhaps because with a lot of the non-ENFP male population, this can often signal ulterior motives by way of misrepresentation). While I felt like I was being about the same level of niceness to them as I was everyone that I wasn't romantically/intimately interested in, apparently that level of attention/niceness could also be interpreted negatively (clingy/emotional/odd/etc). So... I adopted a "not as nice" approach when it did come to romantic pursuits - I've, after 20yrs of reflection, come to believe that I wasn't actually being more of a dick or anything, but instead I was simply exhibiting more confidence and more directly expressing interest -  and as I am sure that you've likely been told before, people often find confidence attractive.\n\nBut it's funny... My senior year of high school felt like someone of a transformation... With my new approach to intimacy, I found my romantic record improving. I quit caring so much about what people thought and started trying to be more true to who I felt that I was - changed how I carried myself, how I dressed, what interests I pursued, etc.,. There's a lot of truth to "you will never succeed if you don't try" - and my increased confidence plus my decreased caring just made things happen more organically. For me, getting out of my element was also initially a big help - beach trips or school trips that exposed me to new people enabled me to be less self conscious, find some romantic success, which led me towards a greater understanding of how this all works across the board (like back home). Confidence. This continued into freshman year of college before meeting my wife, and ultimately contributed to me meeting my wife... As where I seemingly could never find romance before, romance was seemingly regularly finding me.\n\nSo.. To bring this back full circle to your original question - I suppose I did, in some ways, find success in "hiding myself"... But in hindsight I don't know that "hiding" is how to best phrase it... I think that it's more about learning the reality that how people interpret your actions often wins out over your actual intent. I did wind up talking romantically with some females that I'd previously been friendzoned with, some of which did confide "I just figured you were trying to get in my pants" - because that's apparently often what non-ENFPs are up to when being really nice. My being "less nice" provided the needed space for them to get to know me - then when they did get to know me, they realized that I was really a nice and, at times, insecure guy (vs my persona of confident outgoing party guy). Order of this process of discovery matters. If they feel that you're being overly nice out of the gate, then their guard may be more likely to go up early on. Like I said, this is something that my wife actually explicitly told me early on in our relationship as like moved towards love - "You're not the guy that I first thought you were when we met", which is a good thing because the guy she initially thought I was was "fling material", not "put a ring on it" material...\n\nBest of luck, fellow feeler!
2	As an ENFP gal dating an ENFP guy: unfortunately, your ENFP self may not fit into the stereotype of a masculine man, but I assure you that there are potential partners out there who will appreciate you for your beautiful, ridiculous self.
2	Yo Im an ENFP girl and ive always thought that my quirky personality hinders me from being perceived as sexually attractive. I always feel like I should hide around people I like or just in general (which is bad I know). But, it took a lot for me to get to the point where I can be the extraverted friend in a friend group rather than having a panic attack from entering a store where I have to speak to a cashier. After all that I went through to get to this point, it just wouldn‚Äôt be right for me to hide myself. \nYou may be asking why I feel like people perceive me as sexually unattractive... its cause I have always been friend zoned, a rebound, used because someone was bored, or I am at least 90% of the time rejected. I have never been genuinely approached by people who would actually like to take me out for the sake of getting to know me as a person rather than how good I would be in bed. I fear that no genuine approaches have been made because I am the ‚Äúweird‚Äù girl.  I used to try and approach people but after my last experience I have given up even trying to talk to new people, even to make friends. The situation was pretty heavyweight so.... yeah. I feel like I have reluctantly accepted the fact that people will probably never find me worthy as a significant other. I have accepted the heavy feeling of lonesomeness and no longer try to rid it from myself. It sucks cause I am a very protective kind of person so I would be a very attentive and supportive partner cause I care about people SO MUCH, almost too much. I would die for some of my friends even no matter the pain they put me through some days because, well, the heart wants what the heart wants and it cant be changed. I surround myself with my close friends any chance I get but it never takes the loneliness away. All I desire is a person that I can cuddle with, make soup for them when theyre sick, watch them conquer their biggest fears, wake up to their face at the dawn of day, and just overall feel a caring presence by my side.\n\nThis got real dramatic oops but I havent exactly vocalized or put my thoughts into words before but this was a post that was suitable enough to do so. If you read this far, thanks for your time.\n\nTL;DR I am an ENFP and have struggled in the relationship department as well. Like the person who originally posted this, I feel the need to hide my personality too. It has affected me a lot. Thats the gist.
2	The real challenge is knowing who you are. Getting to know who you even hide. Cuz I don't really know.
2	Get sexual asap. No = no and yes = yes
4	As an ENFP, is it possible to put the cat back in the bag?	I‚Äôm a poly ENFP guy and I‚Äôve been in a loving relationship for 14 years. However, 18 months in to catching a serious case of the feels for a close female friend, I told them that I‚Äôd like to maybe take them on a date and that I‚Äôd felt that way for quite some time. Queue a serious friend zone incident.\n\nNow I get that this was probably the outcome I should have expected. Poly is a niche that not everyone feels comfortable exploring. I‚Äôm still pretty heart broken though because I‚Äôm normally pretty good at reading a situation and I‚Äôve always felt like there was something more underlying our closeness. Perhaps that was just a case of ‚Äòmaybe if you were single‚Äô though as she alluded to.\n\nAnyway... my ultimate question is, can you put the cat back in the bag once it‚Äôs out? Things are super awkward between us now and it‚Äôs pretty crippling to have laid it all out there only to lose a friend in the process. Is coming back from this kinda thing to just have a normal friendship even doable for ENFPs? It just feels like a huge ask right now...
6	I‚Äôve had a very hard time doing that myself in a similar situation, unfortunately. And it sucks horribly because I really, really miss my friend.\n\nFuck.*queue the tears.* lol üòÜ
4	I think rejection is always really hard, perhaps especially so for very sensitive types like us. I've had a couple things over the past year with guys that I genuinely really liked as people - one was just a flirty thing and the other resulted in dating for a couple months. In both cases it wasn't a good idea to proceed further than that, and in both cases we sat down and talked it out so that we wouldn't lose each other. It was fucking awkward at first of course but I'm happy to say they're both very close friends of mine now :)\n\nIn my experience, letting it fester is going to make it way worse. I think we tend to overthink EVERYTHING and wondering how other people are feeling definitely keeps us up at night. I know it sounds impossibly uncomfortable but I'd suggest talking to her. She'd probably appreciate it if you approached it in a frank way - something like "Hey I know this is gonna be an awkward talk but I just want to clear the air and let you know that I'd like to still be friends."\n\nBest of luck!!
3	All awkward passes eventually IMO.  sometimes it just takes a little space.
2	In my experience, totally possible and common to still be friends. Easier if not a hetero situation, though.
2	I think it's possible to return to a more normal friendship over time. It may never be exactly the same as before, but you can return to something healthy and sustainable if both of you genuinely want it to continue and be totally platonic. The thing is, it can be awkward and disturbing for the other person, knowing you're crushing on them and probably fantasising about them. Give her plenty of time and space to process this - you probably also need some distance to get over your feelings and move on.\n\nI would also add, if you want to continue the friendship, don't flirt with her at all, confess feelings repeatedly or ask her out again. I (ENFP female) have had to end a number of friendships with men because they just keep trying over and over, even when I've told them I'm not into them. It's very disrespectful and off-putting, so don't misinterpret any continued friendliness as romantic interest unless she explicitly says, "I like you in a romantic way and want to go out on a date together".\n\nIt might help to say something like, "Look, I know this probably feels really awkward and uncomfortable at the moment, so please take all the space and time away from the friendship that you need. It would also probably help me to get over my feelings to have a break. However, if we do rekindle the friendship, I promise I will never ask you out again, and I will do my best to make you feel safe and comfortable. I want to respect your boundaries and keep things genuinely platonic."\n\nThe other thing I would seriously consider is how to avoid this happening in future. Did you find out if she is seriously interested in polyamory? Or did she talk about wanting to try polyamory? If not, then it's pretty unlikely she is going to consider it, even if she likes you in theory. Most people are monogamous, and most women aren't so desperate that they will date someone poly just to be in a relationship - whereas a lot of men are that desperate that they will date poly women just to have someone.
2	Champions and Campaigners?	As I scan these forums I‚Äôve been surprised to see how micro everyone‚Äôs view of ENFP‚Äôs seems to be.  Not trying to sound judgmental in anyway, but I expected more of the Champion/Campaigner discussions and people more concerned with changing society for the positive or using their empathetic intuition to make sense of the world than I‚Äôve seen.\n\nTo me being an empath and using that to make sense of everything has been such a piece of what makes me ENFP.  Anyone else feel the same?  It‚Äôs been interesting to see ENFP‚Äôs in a more personal light but I‚Äôd be lying if I said I wasn‚Äôt a little bummed to see such a lack of Campaigner/Champion discussion.
3	>people more concerned with changing society for the positive or using their empathetic intuition to make sense of the world\n\nENFPs can certainly value changing the world toward what they believe is a greater good (and I'm sure that many of us here do) but perhaps xNFJs would be more likely to strive toward this vision due to their Fe and Ni\n\nAn INFJ friend of mine was very humanitarian-oriented and her sense of "feeling" was more other-focused than my own (due to my Fi vs her Fe) in the grander, community sense
2	>I‚Äôve been surprised to see how micro everyone‚Äôs view of ENFP‚Äôs seems to be.\n\nThat is the nature of Te, as in "To Know"\n\nWell complex things are hard "To Know" all the things, but with complex things it is still easy to know some things we can do to improve, to change, to put into motion in order to become better, to improve, to enhance, and to still do it, to know "how to do it."\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe champion and campaigner still exists in the ENFP even if its not obvious present / expressed on the outside, it is instead an internal fire that never ends, this Fi is introverted after all, this eternal fire that drives the fleshy matrix of the ENFP.\n\nThis eternal fire is the heart of the ENFP, and thus...\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPIVOTS\n\nto heart and brain.\n\nhttp://theawkwardyeti.com/chapter/heart-and-brain-2/\n\n^(PS you should read all the awkward yeti comics, I just pushed you to the heart tag for all ENFPs are the heart that drives and powers all the other organs with its optimism, depression, all the other emotions, all the things...somewhere there is a comic of heart burning the list of brain saying we can only afford these thngs.)\n\n
2	You know, I feel like I come to this reddit for personal help in things I'm insecure about myself or to learn a little more about people similar to me.\n\nBut the reason I don't talk about my plans to change the world is because I am sure of how I want to do that and maybe others are too, and I don't feel like I need too much help at the moment. But I'm not afraid on asking for help whenever i get a little sidetracked! \n\nBTW I want to make games that makes people lives way more happier and fun! That's how I want to change the world, putting a smile on everyone, also by just being an example of optimism and values(specifically my Christian values) and also when I have children raise them in the same sistem of tolerant and loving values to keep the next generations to come as happy and good people as I can. 
1	I don't discuss those things on reddit /shrug too much push back and gaslighting when you say you're an empath.
1	I don't really know how I could improve the world at the moment. Yes I could do little things like help the disadvantaged, but I am way to focused on fixing myself right now. Once I get my own shit in order, I'll start taking care of the world more. \n\nAlso, my current 'problems' with the world are out of my reach to solve. I usually tend to route for the issues that are the underdog. In my country that means advocating how out education system could be so much better, even though I live in one of the most advanced countries in the world.\n\nI am also really into the feminism discussion, but that usually just brings up too much hate. I have often quite critical of some parts of feminism, but this then gets me instantly branded as a right wing sociopath, even though I am not right wing at all. \n\nAt the moment I just find the world a bit too frustrating to be saved. In my darkest thoughts I do not really see how it is worth it. I'll vote for the parties that I believe will try to fuck up things the least, and I will go into a profession with which i can later contribute well, but now as a 21 year old college student I will first focus on myself.\n\nLike the expression of doctors. You can't take care of somebody else if you don't for yourself.
1	Those ENFP's aren't spending their time on Reddit.\n\nAlso while we may often have ideals of how we think the world should be we often seem to keep things as just ideals or ideas. Sometimes ideas can be better than the real thing. Or the real thing doesn't seem actually possible, but the idea is still fun to think about.
17	How ENFPs do One-Night Stands	They will always be friendly and flirty with whoever got their attention and expecting somehow that they can get the desired person to bed without having to ask directly while worrying if they might get to attached 
20	I got attached every fucking time, felt shit in the morning if she wasn't around or struck by the "should I stay or should go" song if she was still there.\nI used to write little hints around her room if she left me alone or even leave my number somewhere but luckily they never called back. It wouldn't be a one night stand right?\n\nOh, I almost forgot, when I came back to my friends I was always in the "I find the one" mood and "she will call me back" head-in-the-clouds state. Useless to say how much they laughed.\n\nThat's why I'm not into One-night-stands, they're a lot of fun but too quick to be enjoyable ...
15	my list of partners is over 30 and only one of them was a one night stand. i just can‚Äôt have fulfilling sex with someone if i don‚Äôt feel a deeper connection. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
8	The last girl I was with, had the possibility of being a one-night-only thing. I didn‚Äôt know how invested she‚Äôd be in a relationship since we were both so young (18 yrs old). \n\nThat was over 20 years ago. We‚Äôre now married and we‚Äôve never taken a break on our relationship. So I guess that‚Äôs how I do it!
3	so relatable 
3	i do ons all the time mostly because i like the mystery and intrigue of a new person and the build up which eventually consummates in bed. i don‚Äôt actually care particularly for the sex. after that, i think we have to do activities together to recreate the ‚Äúadventure‚Äù with a person otherwise just meeting up to have sex is boring
4	this is why it never happens 
2	I have had only 1 one night stand, and it was a one night stand because it was a total mistake and I didn‚Äôt even like the guy. But champagne makes me a little silly ü§™
4	My rebound fling turned into a 6 year relationship. Strings come preattached

1	HA So called out right now!\n
17	How do you personally "read a room"	I typically read the room by noticing how people speak and if they are engaged with their speech or disengaged which can tell me if they are excited, bored, don't really like something, arent happy a specific person is there etc. And another thing I notice is the breathing patterns of individuals. If people are breathing heavily I can sense anxiety, fear or embarrassment etc. I'm sure I use other methods by observing body language and eye contact but these were what I notice myself measuring primarily.\n\nHow do you personally read a room?
10	I am a nurse so I analyze people physically and can't turn it off. Weird limp? Is it hip, knee, ankle, sciatica? Clubbing nails. Ruddy nose/face. Ashen/bronze skin? Nails yellow/thicken/dirty? Skin dry/flakey- liver/kidney issues. Petechiae? Bruising, wounds? Emotional or emotionaless/flat/withdrawn. Anxious/overreating? Pupils small or large inappropriate to the lighting in the room? Thin hair/breakage. No hair on legs, male over 50, arterial perfusion issues? Recent change in habits. Poor appetite/overeating. \n\nI am not making any judgements at all. It's not in my personality at all to judge in that way. I just notice them. I casually notice these things passively in the back of my mind. I am trained to do this to give me more info to help the patient. Before I even listen to your lungs or lay hands on I've assessed a handful of things. Because noticing things like dirty/thicken nails or dry flaky skin or matted oily hair in a patient can tell me a lot about their home situation. Are they able to care for themselves correctly? Are they showering? Bruising in various places on body, are they falling a lot at home and not telling us or do they have a clotting issue? Should we run a panel to rule it out? Is the patient acting different/subdued when a certain family member is in the room? Are they letting that person speak for them? Is their a possibilty of abuse going on? I should wait till that persons out of the room to ask if they are safe at home. Watching what they eat or what their family brings in for food gives me an idea of how well they are controlling their diabetes at home. Is my heart failure patient complaining our bland food and wanting salt. Do they understand the relation of salt/high sodium foods they eat at home and why they are being admitted for fluid overload and can't breath. Is the patient flat/withdrawn? Is it anxiety being in the hospital or is there something going on at home? Have a heart to heart and realize their son recently died and they need support. Even though they are admitted for pneumonia and didn't mention this we can help because we assess something is off. I walk in and my patient is sleeping. I see them having apenic pauses. Have they been tested for sleep apnea? Oh they have but won't wear their mask? Do they understand the relationship of that decision to their admission for a heart attack. \n\nIts very helpful in my job and what I trained for but I can't turn it off.
5	a good one is pace and dynamic of conversation. Is each person taking a turn, somewhat taking their time to thoughtfully express themselves. Are people smiling while quickly talking over each other and landing on the person most animated or loud. Is the attention on a particular person of interest to the group. Is the room hanging in a casual comfortable silence, chatting only so often about something applicable.  Stuff like that. 
2	Personally I first get gut reactions but I'm also an Empath.  I go by feeling first.  If everything is quiet and still I'll know that people are uncomfortable or feeling uneasy or self conscious. In other situations, I'll scan around the room and spot the people who seem to be involved in serious or private conversation, they are often standing very close to one another sort of sealing themselves off from everyone else.  I tend to migrate to areas where women are just laughing and talking and things feel light or bubbly.  I kind of avoid the spots where men are and head toward the woman, but I'm a woman :)
2	When I am interviewing with a team, I am able to notice very small subtleties that allow me to accurately access how the interview is going so far. Most of that information is gained by the questions they ask and what style they choose to ask me. Subconsciously, I think to myself, "why did they ask this question?" or, "why ask it in this style?"\n\nI would leave the interview thinking I did well or miserably performed poorly. Over 90% of the times, I am right!
2	I look around, smell the air a little, look at how people are acting, and what is in the room. I go based off of expectations of what I've been told about it, and who I know will be there if I know any at all.
2	I usually do my rounds, see if the vibe is upbeat, mellow ect and match the energy with mine. And then notice the person who is looking out of place or not having fun and go get to know them so they feel included. 
1	I read other stuff in a room, not people like that. I am actually bad at knowing what others are feeling. Unless they're an animal.
71	Do you ever think in multiple perspectives at once?	Sometimes when contemplating a decision I "consult myself" in what I refer to as myself in the ages. There is Jillerski the child (pure/innocent/simple minded) then there is Jillerski the father (concerned about impact on others/future affects on others) and then there is Jillerski the elder (no bullshit/straight up/tells it how it is) \n\nIn my mind I have these three around me like we are in a circle conversing and I represent the current time in my life I'm at now (Jillerski the ambitious young adult) \n\nSometimes these exchanges all happen in a few seconds or for longer periods of time.\n\nI was just wondering if anyone else did this
32	I don‚Äôt have defined personalities, but I definitely have had conversations or arguments with myself. They‚Äôre actual voices that say different things.\n\nI told my INTJ gIrlfriend once that I had this. She thought it was creepy as hell. Now that we‚Äôre married with two kids, she still thinks it‚Äôs creepy as hell. 
14	I do this too, but mine are less defined.  I change based on what environment that I‚Äôm in and who I‚Äôm with. I am also influenced by books or movies that I watch. Not just how I think and act but what I wear. Like if I‚Äôm feeling more mature I dress fancy. Not sure if that makes sense. 
11	You know, you just made me realize I do kinda do this, and I think I will define the perspectives in a similar way that you do, because I do always think before making a decision in a optimistic-everything-will-work-out/I-hate-this-unfair way (me the child), please-be-careful-dont-get-hurt/I'm-glad-you-happy-but-consider-others way(father), you-know-this-will-probably-fail/this-is-a-good-idea way(elder), and the present me just kinda listens and tries to make a good decision out of the advices, wow, present me is such a passive fuck\n\nI guess this is why I sometimes take so long to decide, shit 
12	My therapist noticed this in me and has had me have separate conversations with my ‚Äú11 year old self‚Äù and my ‚Äú35 year old self‚Äù (I‚Äôm 26) to allow them time to speak. It sounds silly but it actually worked quite well. 
3	i do this sometimes. it can really help with processing information. i find it helpful to add more voices in with different life events. kind of like milestones. i don't always understand the perspective i'm getting at with any particular voice though, but if you have enough things tend to work out.\n\nits kind of like they're different aspects of the totality of me, and rather than i myself taking part in the discussion (though i guess i do, now that i'm putting words to it?) its more like i'm the leader and they are my advisers...
2	Yup I think kinda like this. I have a voice in my head saying "you, got this!" Or "you probably shouldn't be doing that" *continues to eat tub of ice-cream. Then I have so many thoughts that I yell at my other self, "Shut up! Can we take a moment of silence. Jeez!" O.o 
2	I definitely believe that I have some different facets to myself.... like a boy me and a girl me for example. Sometimes my inner monologue is masculine sometimes it's feminine, the voices change with it... and the way I see myself physically. 
2	I encourage you to look in to internal family systems. :)
2	This is very interesting I think many types do something similarly. I don‚Äôt typically argue my thoughts but they do evolve in stages and no doubt it can be different sides as a possible dominant meaning one abstract nature verses another. But it is one. However I have multiple many many multiple thoughts at once that occur most of the time. I‚Äôm more than likely seeing from multiple perspectives really it is like another dimension seeing through and all sides of the subject at once. But I‚Äôm INFJ and I‚Äôve heard that if the types were different drugs.. I‚Äôd be LSD so that does explain a lot. Haha. But it‚Äôs probably the same system as what you speak of.. it‚Äôs just very abstract comparatively.
2	I don't know if it's the same thing but I definitely weigh every big decision I have to make from both sides, and can go as far as imagining all future outcomes of my choice (Yes, very much like Doctor Strange).\n\nFor example, if I find myself attracted to someone, there's always a side of me that berates myself for liking that person ("Is it their cute hair? It's just their cute hair, isn't it?"). I do this continuously till I prove to myself that I actually like them for who they are, not simply for physical/aesthetical purposes (happens sometimes).  
2	I've started doing this over the past 2ish years! (I just turned 27)\n\nI think this is great proof of evolving maturity (especially for ENFPs). I read that when we are young we are exactly like you described, pure/innocent/simple minded, and as we grow up we start to recognize patterns and start to think whether or not to act on them. I feel like this is basically where our cognitive functions start to emerge and kick into higher gear. \n\nJillerski the child is probably the manifestation of the Extraverted Intuition (our primary function, interacting with the world, interpreting situations and relationships, picking up meaning from context)\n\nJillerski the father is probably the development of Introverted Feeling (secondary function, values, beliefs, worth)\n\nJillerski the elder is definitely Introverted Sensing (our last function on the list, which is usually very underdeveloped when we are young and crucial for long term stability, and it involves reviewing and recalling past experiences and seeking detailed data to proceed carefully without repeating past mistakes).\n\nI could be wrong! I'm no psychologist but I've read a few books about ENFPs... If anyone wants to correct me please do! :) 
2	I talk to all the quantum me's in indras web. Just about little daily things. If I'm thinking of them, it's likely some of them are thinking of me. So we talk this way. Same with extra terrestrials. Some of them are thinking about life off their planet, and at least a few of those have to know some of us think of them too. Then viola, communication can ensue. I talk to my cells in a similar way. Just like I'm a cell in something, I talk out too, not just in. \n\nAs far as this timeline and mundane human crap, when it comes to decision making, I talk with intent amongst my different brains. In the modes they prefer. Left, right, mid and rear. I consider my gut and my skin part of my brain, and my little cell buggies, so they aren't excluded but they 'speak' very differently. 
2	All the time. I appreciate the friends who give me space to express it all. The rest just think am too much\n
2	I do this quite often and although i think it's a blessing, it's also a curse because it leads me to indecisiveness so it takes me 56456 hours to decide on the simplest thing - let's say what should i eat for dinner. Like, should i eat apple pie or vegan burrito? I'll never know...
2	We're all alright. 
2	Yeah I got 4 afaik. One takes over from time to time. I put it down to having separate desires and each requiring a particular behaviour.\n\nOne is the achiever (military all or nothing balls to the walls style 110% efforr)\n\nOne is the comfort chill seeker (wants a steady pace, good food, chilled life)\n\nOne is the fun thrill seeker (people loving, childish and goofy)\n\nOne is the darkness (only shows if I get seriously pissed off or wronged)
2	I posted a similar post on the INTJ (Inner Dialogue) subreddit and most people were saying we experienced this. I suggest having a look to see what they said. Im not sure if it is the same thing but I agree with what you're saying.
1	This is pretty normal for Ne-doms. Only natural if you're an ENFP.

4	making friends in a new country	i recently moved to germany (munich) from the US for work and the last thing i thought i would have troubles with is making friends. i‚Äôve been feeling very lonely and socially anxious which is so unlike me. i think i have lost a lot of my confidence not being able to speak the language and also i just feel super out of place in terms of how i look and dress. basically all the options i see seem bleak or slow or maybe i‚Äôm being too picky:\n\n- befriend coworkers - i prefer to keep my work and personal friends separate because i feel like i need to present a certain persona at work. i also feel self conscious at work, just like someone going to a new school for the first time where everyone is already friends. any time i enter group conversations everyone has to switch from german to english and i feel like it‚Äôs awk (yes i‚Äôm learning german but it‚Äôs gonna take awhile)\n\n- meetup groups - i‚Äôve found some friends through here but only through the ones involving group activities. but now with the winter there are less activity based ones and more just random happy hours, which tend to be a lot of small talk and weird female/male dynamics.\n\n- sports - an expensive option. i‚Äôd like to do ski trips but it‚Äôs hella expensive. i could probably try some other indoor sports although i‚Äôm not particularly interested in them, but might be necessary as i like to do active things\n\n- living with people - i chose to live alone as the housing market here is really difficult when you don‚Äôt know anyone. but i think it‚Äôs best if i eventually transition to a shared living situation.\n\nmeh. now i think warmer places are more conducive to friendships, there‚Äôs just more activities to do outside.\n\ni think the biggest thing i have to get over is the drop in my confidence level. i know it sounds really stupid but i feel like all these europeans dress and look so nice and i‚Äôm like this asian chick from the west coast who lives in leggings. and i don‚Äôt speak german and it‚Äôs like even forcing myself to make eye contact with people is difficult. damn, i just don‚Äôt feel like myself at all\n\nany suggestions for other avenues to meet people or similar experiences are much appreciated
3	I am short on time so can't respond much. \n\nI've lived in a couple different countries too, and even spent 1 month in Germany. I was actually going to live in Germany long-term with an ex!! \n\nFirst, it sounds like you've got culture shock. Look it up. It's normal and a struggle. \n\nSecond, don't worry about not speaking German. Germans are used to speaking English. Most people are. I was very insecure about speaking English in Europe for the longest time. \n\nIn fact, Germans in my experience are happy to and prefer English. I know you're in Munich where it's more "German," but still, they'll speak English and won't mind it. \n\nOne struggle will be when you're with a group of Germans and they're all spekaing English then someone starts spekaing German and you get locked out of the convo. When that happens, single one person out to create a side conversation in English. Slowly it'll roll over and people will start English again. \n\nBut honestly I feel your struggles bit time. Don't worry, I've done it before, many times. \n\nAlso mentality is everything. Start reframing everything positivley and you'll see positive results :) \n\nMaybe Tinder would be nice if you're single? Even just to make friends. I've used Tinder just to meet people before. It's funny because I'm a guy, and usually it's the girls that use it to meet people. \n\nCheck out Couchsurfing. You'll meet other travelers that share your struggles. Hopefully you'll meet some expats too. \n\nLook for Facebook groups for expats, there should be a "foreigners in Munich" FB group. \n\nMaybe post on Reddit too? While living in Bulgaria I posted in /r/Bulgaria saying I'd buy drinks for anyone that met up with me. Made some great friends, met a few weirdos, and one of them is one of my best friends to this day :) \n\nAs a fellow ENFP, all I can say is SOCIALIZE. Get out. Put a lot of effort & focus into that. Focus on making one good social connection that can introduce you to others. Then once you infiltrate that circle you make friends with everyone, meet their circles, etc. and BAM you're famous as the cool leggings Asian west coast chick in Munich... positive reframe :3 \n\nI'd write more but GTG. Really nothing to worry about. I've moved to a new country a few different times... It's a fucking struggle but sooo worth it. Good luck :) 
3	Maybe you can find inside activities that work for you. Like board games or knitting or photography. Munich is a big city there are probably groups for everything. \nI'm not German but I'm often in Germany and know a lot of Germans. In my experience, they need more time to get to know you but once that is settled you have friends for a lifetime. They don't care how you dress as long as it is clean. \nIf you want to talk feel free to DM me or chat. üòä
2	Can totally relate, and personally I would hate moving to a foreign country because there‚Äôs nothing I fear more than feeling like a foreigner myself ... an outsider.\n\nThat being said, I‚Äôm sure it will turn out differently for you since you came up with the idea in the first place - you‚Äôre probably better at adapting and eventually fitting in than I am.\n\nYou mention warm countries as a plus when moving away - so this is a cold country? May I ask which country?\n\nI‚Äôm from a cold country myself and yes, it does limit your possibilities of socializing. You have to know people and be invited to come over to their house cuz people don‚Äôt just hang outside and meet new people randomly ... not at this time of year anyway.
50	What are your Niches?	I found a new way to reflect on self. Niches are basically the knowledge of hobbies and interests you have gained. All of this talk about putting up Niche blogs and channels and I thought, why not just brainstorm on all of my niches? Turns out I had no idea how cool this was until I wrote them down. \n\n \n\nCustom Building Computers\n\nGraphics Cards\n\nConsole gaming\n\nPC gaming\n\nCognitive Functions\n\nEmotional Processing\n\nEmotional Intelligence\n\nSQL\n\nPiano

12	Fitness, dance, cats, makeup/beauty, interpersonal relationships, improvisation (more in real life contexts than stage acting, although I've done that too), breaking down concepts and teaching them to others, geography/sense of direction/spatial awareness, cooking/baking

Questioning everything. Whistleblowing. The Intelligence Community. HIM. Personality Disorders. Fantasy v. Reality. Music. Neuropsychology.
10	I go through periods of hyper fixation on certain topics, and then get bored (not sure if this is an ENFP thing or not) I tend to invent theories or go through huge projects. i'm actually pretty proud of my accomplishments, but they're all useless now. \n\n**Cats:** my first fixation- i can name and identify every single breed of cat out there and the breeding history of each type. (really helpful)\n\n**Harry Potter:** pretty typical of a lot of kids honestly\n\n**Speed Reading**\n\n**Ukrainian History** ([http://www.vlesknyha.com/](http://www.vlesknyha.com/))\n\n**Novel Writing:** (my most productive fixation) i wrote a 300-page novel, with a lot of plot holes though\n\n**Philosophy/Sociology:** (another productive one, but not practical, i wrote two papers on new theories i invented)\n\n**Music Theory:** i can now play almost any instrument by ear (not too well) which is cool but useless\n\n**The Sixties Scoop:** really interesting (horrifyingly so) and overlooked event- [https://indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca/sixties\_scoop/](https://indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca/sixties_scoop/)\n\n**Eva Peron:** brilliantly interesting historical figure\n\n**Socionics/Cognitive Functions**\n\nI'm sure there are more, just can't think of them right now. The frustrating thing about having these fixations is that i put all my energy into them (and they're usually interesting but impractical), which detracts from the energy i have for  everyday productivity. \n\nat least my life isnt boring!!! i can live with that!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;

2	I think this is one of the best posts I've seen on this sub. Literally shows how amazing ENFPs are with all of our interests. It's also incredible to see so many people with similar interests.

3	this is honestly such an intresting thread its so cool to hear about other people's intrests!!\n\ni noticed a lot of people mentioned self-care. is fixating on self-care common for sp-blind people? i'm a sx/so and often find myself fixating on self care, kind of to make up for my overall lack of sensory awareness of my own needs. 
1	History (ancient and medieval)\n\nReligions (non abrahamic ones)\n\nNo memory to write more :>
1	I think we, as human beings, should generally be interested in pretty much everything, and some of your list is just general hobbies, but I get what you mean about *very* specific niches. I'm that way with smallpox. I consume every scrap of information I can about it. It's completely fascinating to me.
1	Tarot/Oracle reading; Nature/Nature Spirits; graphology/handwriting analysis; crochet; cats and birds; art; pen and ink drawing; reading; and womens spirituality
1	I tried to find patterns in the interests listed in this thread because I went in expecting a variety of interests that are all over the place.\n\nIn general, I noticed that most people here are interested in various aspects of the human condition (psychology, language, etc.) with a focus on interpersonal relationships, i.e. there's less of a focus on how humans function as a biological organism. \n\nIn other words, NFs gonna NF :D
1	Wake boarding&skiing, sports, traveling, going to shows/festivals, Mexican food, cats, any and all movies/tv shows, occasionally will work out, MUSIC (odesza, Alison wonderland, nectar, rl grime, ZD, slightly stoopid), piano but I haven‚Äôt played lately.. never had time in nursing school for a lot of things I used to love doing so I‚Äôm looking for new hobbies if anyone has suggestions!

21	I think I Te Bitch slapped someone today...	There's this guy I work with who has said some hurtful things to me in the past "as a joke." But I can't shake the feeling that he just wants to take me down a peg. Well, I asked him to not joke like that last month and to be respectful and that he hurt me and he half-heartedly apologized and said he would. I gave him the benefit of the doubt.\n\nFast forward to today and he's back to the same tactic. Well, the guy is an open book with the way he talks, and it was pretty obvious to me what I could say to make him feel some of what I felt. I don't know what came over me because I don't want to be petty, but I cocked back my insult and slung it as far as I could into his insecurities. As intended, the insult was very effective, but that's not a good thing. Yes, it felt good saying it, but to be real I feel like I sank to his level.\n\nI don't want to be this way, is there any healthier way of telling someone to STFU? I realize many examples of the Te bitch slap are arguments and not insults, but I feel like this fits in and honestly I feel legitimately terrible about it. \n\nAny fellow ENFP advice would be greatly appreciated
25	Sometimes a bitch slap is needed. Don‚Äôt feel bad, I bet it straightened him out a bit.
5	I got no advice tbh but I'm curious about what was said. 
3	I have done this, only when backed into a corner by someone, and honestly they deserved it but I still felt gross. You can apologize if the situation warrants it and he acts like a kicked puppy, or he could be the kind of asshole who needs to be knocked down before he behaves like a decent person. In that case don't apologize, it'll ruin any ceasefire. Just hold your head high and respect yourself. 
3	Adult bullies exist, and the ways to deal with them in adulthood are similar to that in childhood. \n\nSometimes a bully needs to be slapped in the face. Some types just naturally lean on others boundaries and insecurities and get entertainment from getting a rise out of others, and whether or not they realize it their words do matter. Letting these types go on in life without facing any repercussions (such as social disapproval or getting their own shit thrown back at them) just enables the behavior. \n\nIf someone hurts you again after telling them to knock off that behavior, you have every right to make them uncomfortable. Its not your responsibility to just take it in order to maintain cohesion, because the other person is not interested in the same things you are. You wouldn't intentionally hurt someone else for your own amusement. \n\nIts good to feel bad about hurting others, i'm not saying to go out into the world looking to put everyone in their place. But just like its good to feel bad about hurting others, its also good to feel proud for defending yourself. Don't be afraid of that. \n\nIf you feel like you went too far, you can apologize to him privately and reiterate what you've said before. But unless you really feel that way, just let it be. The thing about work is that people are forced to be around each other, and because of that its everyone's job to try and maintain a healthy environment. The people who cause unhealthy or toxic environments are always unaware of what they do. 
1	Wouldn't it be nice to hug him next time?

1	Being direct and expressing your feelings and wishes to someone can work well with *some* people. Others seem to really need to be 'taught a lesson', unfortunately. \n\nSometimes, a "talk shit, get hit" mentality is the only thing that gets through to some people. Especially ones that delight at jabbing at people they know will likely be too nice or polite to retaliate.\n\nSometimes giving someone a taste of they're own medicine is exactly what needs to be done, as long as you don't make it a habit or do it out of retribution, but, do it for the sake of *education*...if that makes any sense. Some people won't learn to stop being a dick unless there's a consequence they can understand (like a well-aimed jab at their off-putting behavior).
11	Just checking in	Tell me about what is going on in your lives. Any new recent discoveries or obsessions? Do you like your jobs? I‚Äôd love to hear. 
12	Yesterday I was trying to decide between two potential love interests, this morning I picked one, this evening I freaked out and decided that I don‚Äôt want either of them. Flying solo is too fun! What will tomorrow bring?
5	I'm 33 and living alone for the first time in my life, and in my very own house.  I thought I would be a lot more lonely, but I'm actually really digging the solitude.  I can fully embrace being a nightowl without worrying that I'm bothering anyone.
3	I‚Äôve been delving into the horror movie genre, lately! I‚Äôm currently obsessed with The Witch (stylized ‚ÄúThe VVitch‚Äù) starring Anya Taylor-Joy
2	I just went to the Texas premiere of dragon Ball super, broly. I felt like a 12 year old watching cartoons again, I was so amped afterwards!
2	So excited for this year in general! Made a resolution to actually get out there and start introducing myself to people in the hopes of making new friends instead of others to strike up conversation with me. Really looking forward to the prospect of meeting new people and possibly making new friends!
2	Today at work we brought in a consultant to meet with the team and review our Personalysis profiles and talk about ways we can improve our communication and how we interact with each other. It was awesome because everyone wanted to be there and enjoyed the experience. I kept trying to figure out how this system could align with MBTI but quickly gave up on that and just enjoyed the conversation. 
6	As an ENFP, what would you say your love language is? Mine is touch and gifts and I feel deprived of both in my life	This is almost like a small rant, but I feel like I give a lot to the people i care about in their love languages that I know of but feel a sense of loss with mine.\n\ni realized this after a lot of self reflection, but I‚Äôve noticed that I have taken on a bad habit of SEEKING. I often do or say things that I wish my close friends/dating person would reciprocate. However, when they DO reciprocate I don‚Äôt enjoy it as I envision it happening or I feel that it‚Äôs forced. My SO doesn‚Äôt like touches so that‚Äôs already out of the question. \n\nFor example, I would look at the person I‚Äôm dating (ENFJ) at the end of the day and be like, thank you for being in my life, I really appreciate you hoping that maybe one day they‚Äôd say it too to my satisfaction. OR sometimes I‚Äôd buy them a shirt I think they would like as I‚Äôm shopping etc. And hope that someday they‚Äôll bring me a small thing as they are shopping too. \n\nI‚Äôm not sure if this is the dreamer, floaty, commitment-avoidant person in me but just wanted to get a sense if anyone else felt the same way! 
6	However you just described this habit of seeking - I certainly exhibit that as well. It's hard elaborate and I've little other input to provide but at the very least I just wanted to mention that as an ENFP I know exactly what you mean and that I do it too and that run on sentences are acceptable and that I'm not even sure if I completely understand what's constitutes a run on sentence or simply gibberish.\n\nHope that helped! üëç
3	Same. I'm a words of affirmation & quality time type of ENFP girl, & I do the same thing you mentioned to my husband in an effort to make HIM feel loved so I in turn can feel loved, I guess, even though in retrospect it's a rather passive aggressive way to evoke affection... Lol
3	Words of Affirmation 100%. Having an INFP boyfriend, I feel a bit deprived sometimes (I can compliment him all damn day), but his love language is touch, so I‚Äôve been trying my hardest to notice when he wants to cuddle, or less obvious touches like stroking my hair, or his hand on my knee when we‚Äôre sitting together, stuff like that; And I‚Äôve noticed he does it constantly, which makes me feel so loved, though we communicate it differently 
3	Time>Touch>Words>>>Acts/Gifts
2	My top two are touch and words of affirmation. I DEFINITELY seek words of affirmation, always have from friends and relationships. I feel I‚Äôm always writing thoughtful, deep notes of appreciation in hopes to receive it. It sucks because it doesn‚Äôt happen often, but knowing my SO‚Äôs love languages are different helps, and I feel loved by recognizing how he shows it! (However, I would NEVER be compatible with someone who didn‚Äôt like physical touch, it‚Äôs very important in romantic relationships for me!) 
1	I confessed to my therapist that I feel like part of the reason I'm down lately is because I rarely get physically touched now that I'm out of a relationship. I can't imagine what it's like to be in a relationship and not get a moderate amount of it. My other love language is words. 
0	Gifts and acts "I made you a laundry" are non enfp things
8	I've been in my shadow self for too long...	Edit: I also went into a dominant-tertiary loop which wasn't good either lol \n\nBeen reading a lot on enfp literature, and I've realized I've spent wayy too long (7 months) in my shadow self. \n\nIt all started in June of 2018 when I was forced to leave a country that had became my home. \n\nSaying goodbye to my friends, home, lifestyle, routine, and most importantly... Girlfriend was terrible. \n\nI'd have to be gone for 3 months. For the relationship, we planned on being apart 1 month, together 1 month (abroad), then apart 1 month. \n\nAs I read about the ENFP shadow, it shocks me how much it calls to me. \n\nI let my life fall apart. I let my finances get screwed. I let my relationship fall apart. I made decisions without considering how I'd feel. I tried to escape my hell but it only made it worse. \n\nI wish that I could've read the shadow stuff beforehand, so I'd know how to keep myself stale during the process. Maybe then I'd still have her...\n\nRight now I'm in the process of slowly reactivating my Te and sometimes I'm reactivating Fi. Ne is still repressed or fearful/paranoid for me. \n\nAll that being said I'm an enfp so you already know I'll recover and come back stronger, with time :) \n\nJust had to share I'm grateful to know this now for the next time shit hits the fan, and maybe I inspire a few of you to research the shadow stuff because that's what's gonna keep you together when it all falls apart...\n\nP.S. With Fi coming back maybe I can see about that relationship being fixed...? 
2	Goodnight hun!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
1	What do you mean by enfp literature? Give me domek examples please.
16	How to make you happy?	What can you say to make an enfp happy?\n\nIn friendship? \n\nRomantically? \n\nProfessionally? \n
21	Listen to them. Be interested in their ideas. Relate to their feelings. Be a good human being. Take care of yourself. Then take care of them. 
17	A "good job" is a little piece of piece of serotonin candy for the brain.  If you want to get them a cake, say, "You are a good person."
11	friendship: Go with our flow and be ready to talk about lots of stuff and have a lot of fun! but also let us know when we may be going blindly enthusiastically into something that might not be good for us\n\nRomantically: be the warmest most supportive being on this earth, be authentic, say what you mean and  want all the time, no reservations, feel free to go all out on us, you can trust us\n\nProfessionally: fucking help us focus and get shit done, be very strict, dont sugar coat things, even if we may get a little offended we fucking need a firm hand to push us to go through with stuff, remind us of what needs to be done we can easily forget stuff that you may not think anyone could forget
12	I appreciate you.
11	Be my cheerleader. 
6	ask them questions! prompt them to talk about what they love! let them inspire you!  
3	In friendship: be present, be supportive, let us help, give us accolades.\nRomantically: be present, be supportive, let us help, give us accolades, be cute as hell with us.\nProfessionally: help us stay focused, be supportive, let us help, give us accolades, but definitely tell us what we can improve or we won't know we need to.
2	romantically, just really activley show how u feel us. don't be shy or don't forget to actually "show" lol . like you guys are pretty forgetful about responding or showing affection .... that could make us frustrated. 
1	I‚Äôm an INTP male dating an ENFP female. All of the above is true. 
1	Be honest, whatever comes to your mind
18	ENFPs frustrated with themselves?	Any ENFPs here are just fed up of themselves because of how conflicting your own feelings are (Fucking honestly feel like I have 5 different feelings all running in parallel, each one deciding to "PickaBoo!" at the world every 15mins), how fickle your attention span is, how like sometimes you're really passionate abt something and like 30 mins later its just gone?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf yes, what do ya do?
7	I learned to counter this through positive thinking. I force myself to think about what could go right and what I‚Äôve done well. Read posts about self-love and have sweet notes posted around your room, or set your lock screen to something empowering. Think of all the little successes you‚Äôve had- you probably didn‚Äôt realize just how many until now. 
2	What emojis do you guys use?!	I just had a fun thought! My emojis of choice are:\n1. pondering ‚ÄúI wonder‚Äù emoji ü§î\n2. my heart is full of love and excitement emoji ü§ó\nAnd 3. Being silly/crazy emoji ü§™ \n\nI dont actually use the third one that much, but I would say that one, along with the other two are pretty good representations of the ENFP personality. What do you guys think?! What would be your top 3 emoji ENFP representatives? And which ones do you  frequently use?\n\nIt would also be fun to choose other emoji combinations to represent other types and see if we can guess which type we were going for.\n\nAlso i hope the actual emojis show up in this post both on phone and computer formats and not a lame rectangle or weird symbol.\n\nCheers! ü§ó

1	I don't usually. I only use the old fashioned ones like :) ;) ;P xd etc.\nEmojis are too girly for me to be honest. 
1	Well, I mostly text my emoji-loathing INTJ husband, so the only one I really use besides the heart is the shrimp emoji.\n\nThere's an Iliza Shlesinger comedy routine where this dude sends her an epic-length bewildering/insulting text she has no idea how to respond to, so she decides to just confuse the fuck out of him and reply with nothing but a single shrimp emoji.\n\nIt's become sort of my "what in the hell do you expect me to say in response to this" hieroglyph.
133	Hopelessness is an ENFPs worst feeling.	For many of us, not being able to shape something to the way we like can be frustrating, especially if it‚Äôs a topic we‚Äôre well-versed in. We feel we should be able to do what we want. Hopelessness causes an ENFP to feel frustrated with everything- even things we once enjoyed. It‚Äôs like, we‚Äôre stuck. If the task is out of our hands... well, goodbye happy life-of-the-party, hello angry-at-the-world. We often feel that people should work harder, should at least try and use their potential. For the ENFP, it‚Äôs all in or nothing. Our message to others is simple: If you‚Äôre going to do something, please, don‚Äôt do it half-assed. \n\nAgree or disagree? 
21	Happy cake day and i completely agree with you.
15	I rarely feel people should work harder. I always assume they‚Äôre doing their best with the capacities they have at that given moment.\n\nBut I DO feel that hopelessness is my worst enemy, just not in regards to my work life. At times, I feel hopeless thinking about the future of my autistic daughter because her diagnosis is an everlasting rollercoaster ride and when we hit rock bottom I often find myself panicking over the thought that we‚Äôre gonna land here over and over again ... probably for the rest of our lives. That‚Äôs just how the condition works. And that‚Äôs a dark and hopeless spot.
11	This was me when I slowly realized that CS wasn‚Äôt what I wanted major in. 
9	I agree - and have been feeling this for a few months now. Any suggestions got getting myself out of this hole ????
9	I have convinced myself over the years that there is always something I can do to better the situation, *always*.\n\nBut maybe that‚Äôs a privilege I have without realizing it. A big hug to everyone who‚Äôs struggling, it really can‚Äôt rain forever my darlings.
6	I wholeheartedly agree.  The day I lose optimism in something is the day I'll be genuinely terrified of myself. Every single thing I do, my hopes and dreams, all count on the fact that I can make a difference. If it's not there, I don't even want to think of what I'll do.  \n\nI genuinely hope you merely pondered about this,  not experienced it.  If you find yourself in that position, I really hope you find your way back to the light. \n\nOh, and happy cake day! „ÉΩ(¬¥‚ñΩÔΩÄ)/
4	Mostly I direct it toward myself. It's like for example I have an exam coming up and get caught up with other stuff to prepare my battle plan in advance and then as the exam approaches and everyone else is pulling off all nighters and scrambling to finish the portion , I slowly but surely begin to start losing hope and giving up midway because I know I haven't prepared up to my standards and then I tell myself why do this stuff all half assed and I become complacent and then that's exactly what I end up doing reinforcing my half assedness instead of trying harder. \n\nIt's a well conceived recipe for self sabotage and disaster that mixed up with the whole self righteous BS of not putting the ''ideal'' effort to get the grade I deserve makes it worse lol
3	Agreed. The life after failing out of College is a blur. It hit me like a whirlwind. It lead to me desperately trying to find myself again, trying to find purpose but with added stress of making it a career. Everything I did from that point on wasn't up to my standards. Now fast forward 3 years later, going to a job I hate, counting the hours till freedom... Its so hard to get back to the ambitious person I once was.  All hope was lost and all I can do is blame myself for not pushing myself and not believing in myself. 
3	Agree, tenfold.
2	It‚Äôs how I feel when I‚Äôm experiencing a panic attack. Other symptoms feel so minuscule compared to it
2	Totally agree!
2	Totally agree. I can't deal with half assed. It will always be all or nothing. 
2	This is why I like you guys, always shooting for excellence!
2	yes, its the worst. For me also stagnation
2	I identify a lot with this, although I'm ENTP. 
2	You get frustrated because you have a preference to how things should be shaped, according to your **personal** liking. Because it is a topic you are "well-versed" in, you are essentially invested in your own preference so deeply that other ways, whether they are actually inferior or not. Are disapproved. You then become frustrated because it's not done according to your liking. You get hopeless because you think your way has no place in the way things currently are, and there is little you can do about it.\n\nNobody should "try to use their potencial", everybody is already there. Doing their current best. And their current best changes every moment. Nobody should work harder, and do anything that you think is right. Because we all have our own individual path. You just think that if you were in their position: **you** would work harder. **you** would try to use your potential. That's being hard on yourself, and you're projecting it onto other people. Be aware.\n\nYour message is impure, and your intention will not be received as you'd like. Read it out loud. It comes from a place of disdain towards others. Love.\n\nMy message to you is,\n\nRemember that we all have our own shapes and ways we like to do things. MBTi shows us how different we can be from each other. But don't let that deceive you. Our differences are minor, and un-important. You're not special. You're just one of many people who think they are special. Embrace yourself, and others. And love every way. Love every shape. And when it's harder. Then don't. But be aware of this judgement you are expressing.
1	Yes. I'm feeling quite hopeless right now. Bad break up. Stuck in a city I don't love. Money problems. Home is on the other side of the world but I can't go there for at least another months even if things go well.... ;/\n\nI don't like seeing this side of me. I feel like so much of my life has passed me by in this past year for NOTHING. It's been a fucking disaster. \n\nI just want my old life back before I lost it all... Before the world crushed me. 
1	There are many ways to die in the west.  Just like there are many ways to live in the wise, live and thrive.\n\nHopelessness is one of the ways to die, it is one of the ways an ENFP hates to die.\n\nBut there are others as well.\n\nI do not like the word "worst" for worst should not be used to compare things when the things compared are present compared to things that are absent.  Aka you are only giving me one choice and making that word "present" while you are not giving me the list of the other choices, the other choices may be 2 more things, 3 more things, 10,000 more things, or a million more things.  And you have already decided that hopelessness is the worse of those 10,000 things.\n\n----\n\nI have more to say but lets do that as a follow up post for it is long.
1	How is this different from other types? Doesn't everybody feel frustrated when they can't do what they want? And frustration is different from hopelessness, isn't it? 
6	ENFPs most diverse MBTI type?	Just wondering, but going through the sub-reddit makes me think that when it come to MBTI, ENFPs have the least in common with each other (I know 4 other ENFPs, all of whom are completely different from me). Is my assumption correct? If so, why?
12	In general people are going to be judged for their actions, this includes hobbies. ENFPs bounce between things like a pinball sometimes. You'll find ENFPs everywhere you go, and they'll all be different because they are in to different things. \n\nWhat ENFPs share is a strong Ne and a weak Si (until its developed). Fi and Te will develop at different times depending on the environment though (you can be an ENFP with Ne and Te being your strongest functions)\n\nWhat that means is ENFPs share a perspective of life that seeks excitement and novelty. Everything has endless possibilities. We struggle to follow through to completion, at least naturally. We often don't notice our surroundings or how often/quickly we change. An ENFP can go on a week-long vacation to some other country and come back seeming like an entirely different person than when they left, for example. \n\nI don't know if this makes ENFPs the most diverse. But its part of why ENFPs are so diverse 
4	They‚Äôre all different but there are certain traits that tie them together. I know tons of other ENFPs that seem totally different from me. 
3	An ENFP rooted in Te is quite different from one preferring Fi. I have this idea - let's try it right now (repeat) vs   I could change things into this - but it doesn't feel right for me.  
1	Funnily enough, according to Dario Nardi, ENFPs actually had the most similar brains compared to people of other types - SJs actually had the most unique individual brains because they tend to be highly specialised in one particular area. ENFPs, on the other hand, tend to take interest in a broad range of areas and hobbies. I think ENFPs appear unique because we tend to emphasise authenticity and often aren't afraid to stand out as being a bit different to the crowd. We can also be quite eccentric, creative and expressive.\n\nHaving said that, I do find that the other ENFPs I know are quite different to me in many respects. They often have different interests, passions, hobbies, careers, values and beliefs to me. We may share similar cognitive functions but it doesn't mean we always connect on a deeper level in terms of similar values and worldviews. I've found that Enneagram type, attachment style, cultural background, life experience, physical/mental health and so on can make a huge difference to a person as well.
1	A lot of it I think is Fi. It is a very individualistic function. It allows us to really know ourselves and what we value and how we feel about things. We develop very strong principles. The thing is we don't all develop the same strong principles. We all have different things we feel super strongly about and will fight for, and sometimes those things oppose.
17	ENFP and To-Do Lists	Does anyone else have a really hard time with to-do lists? I can make them since I always have a million things on my mind. However, when I start getting organized and numbering priorities, I often feel exhausted, because I feel like the work will never stop. I'd rather do things spur of the moment, but I know that doesn't help me get things done. Seems like my productivity is obviously very much P based, but that tends to frustrate me and makes me feel like I'm not doing enough and be careless/inconsiderate to my actual desires. Makes me get stuck in a Ne/Te loop. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get out of this funk?  
7	I actually HAVE to do them because I mess Up everything If I don't and I keep having all this mental load without having spelled it out somewhere. But yeah, I only started doing it 4 years ago.
5	INTJ here, I also have ADHD-Predominately Inattentive, Dyslexia, and other stuff that makes organization and automatically difficult.\n\nI hate To-Do lists for they take me out of the moment and I become so focused on the To-Do List that I lose track of the present and I make more mistakes because of that.  \n\nYou see what we call attention is actually a complex of several types of attentions that do different things and they work with each other and they pass data along from one attention type to another and transform this data along the way.  We can't engage all these attention types simultaneously at 100% but instead we assign ratios of these different attention types and they add up to 100%.  Thus using one more attention type more intensely actually makes you bad / worse at using other attention types.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe solution to this is to think holistically and to figure out the types of attentions you are strong with and the types of attentions you are weak with.  Identify the attentions you are weak with and find artificial means to have external memory devices that to interface with it is not exhausting, it is instead enabling and energizing.  Note taking, to do lists, etc should be something that helps you and not makes you worse at your goals.\n\nLinks a video on this.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tpB-B8BXk0\n\nSome proactive strategies happen at 4 mins in, but watch the first 4 minutes even if you do not have ADHD like I do.  I also have more thorough / in-depth videos but I was trying to go for short / concise but if you want more I can provide more \^_\^
4	The app Habitica is a productivity app made to look like an RPG\n\nI had a great time with that for a while but, lately, I just jot down a few bullet points when I need to remember to do things
4	I have two separate to-do lists: one is 'just for today' and the other is for the prospective next week or month or even 6-months (big projects)\n\nIt is essential to not overload the just for today, to possibly even schedule the tasks with a timeframe.  It's also a huge bonus to include really easy tasks like 'walking the dog' and 'make coffee' on it, just for the satisfaction of crossing some things off from the get.  That satisfaction creates momentum.  \n\nthen for the big projects list, maybe set aside a week or a few days for each big project.  Break up your big project into piecemeal tasks for your daily to-do list, as each big project usually contains a multitude of mini-tasks.  
3	The Ne/Te loop can be self-sabatoging, to be sure. And not only does P-based productivity tend to frustrate me, it can also frustrate others! \n\nI'm quite imperfect but one thing my counselors/therapists have helped me with is using a mantra: "Just do the thing. Just do the thing." (referring to the very first thing on the to-do list - and please make sure the to-do list is realistic for the day!). The problem is I see EVERYTHING on the list all at once and get overwhelmed (or, in a sense, mentally constipated lol).... so if I just do the first thing, that's the very first step to getting "in the zone." I read somewhere that ENFPs often have trouble entering a "flow" state. But if I never take the first, second, third, fourth steps, I'm not even TRYING. The more I follow-through on the "Just do the thing." the more I realize it's not so bad and it's actually satisfying to check things off, and it slowly but surely gets reinforced.\n\nFor practical tips: I use Google Keep for a To Do list app (because it is simple and because I can also put up other notes where I write down random ideas - it gets a little messy, but it at least caters to my P). I don't number things. If I complete a task partially and now must wait on someone else to continue, I break down the task from "do xxxx" to (a) "talk to and discuss with so-and-so important information about xxxx" and (b) "wrap up xxxx" so I can compassionately feel accomplished for what I'd done that day (a). I can seamlessly and simultaneously use this both on my phone and on my desktop computer on [http://keep.google.com](http://keep.google.com)
2	I use to-do lists when I really have a lot going on otherwise I start forgetting things.  But I don't number them.  Maybe if you don't number the things and just start doing and crossing off?  And take little breaks from your list to get coffee, look out the window, etc.
1	I have been making to-do list lately, mainly all the important things/responsibes I should take care of . Its been helping a lot, jot'm down and throughout the day i check things and write notes, that way i can dick around and if ive checked everything then ive done everything that needs to be done and helps to not feel stressed. I even put some fun things to keep the list from being dreadful. 
1	I'm pretty textbook ENFP, but move towards ESTJ when at work, due to the requirements of my job. However, if I'm at home and my wife asks me to get a few things done she'll write them down on a list. I usually add some things on the list that I've already done and cross them out straight away, it either helps with feeling overwhelmed about how much I'm locked into for the day, or does nothing at all but make me feel better about my inability to commit to getting things done! 
1	Nope. Hate them. I tell myself (and anyone who will listen) that the difference between what I get done with and without them is not big enough to warrant making myself miserable using them. \n\nNot to mention, every time I‚Äôve tried to get in the habit of using them, I spent more time looking for them than actually using them!
2	ENFPs as Fe-users?	i was originally mistyped as an ENFJ, until i realize that i was definitely a Ne-dom. However, i still identify with Fe, but in a weird way. I was wondering if anyone had any familiarity or insight into this?\n\nBasically i find myself very very adept with using Fe, probably as much as Ne. However, I tend not to *value* Fe as much as Ne, and kind of feel fake when i use it, despite the fact that i am very good at it. Any other ENFPs with a similar experience, or have i mistyped?
7	I will explains how this works in Socionics, but instead using the MBTI terminology for simplicity.\n\nENFPs are strong in 4 things per Socionics.  Ne but also Ni, Fi and also Fe.\n\nENFPs are weak in 4 things per Socionics.  Te but also Ti, Si but also Se.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut you ENFPs value Fi and not Fe even though you are good at Fe, for really complicated Fe tasks require Ti to be performed well, and ENFPs value Te even though you are weak in it, but ENFPs do not value Ti, and Ti really freaks out the ENFP.  Why does Ti freak out an ENFP per socionics...[skips]... just take my word for it =)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Any other ENFPs with a similar experience, or have i mistyped?\n\nNope from a theory perspective you are describing it perfectly. =)  But please continue sharing lived experiences everyone, I love listen to lived experiences even though I am not an ENFP =)  They are my blanket and I love to snuggle in its warm, soft, covers.
4	\nNo sorry, not me. I strongly dislike Fe and of all the MBTI functions this is the worst one. The fake social game, loved and lived by so many as an accepted standard is a nightmare come true. Yuck. 
1	I agree with roland00. I am an enfp and feel the same way as described by the OP above. I was raised by an esfj father in a deeply religious family. I sometimes think maybe I was taught to value Fe, but I‚Äôm really using Fi when I think I‚Äôm using Fe. In other words, I think I‚Äôm using Fe but maybe I‚Äôve adopted the golden rule as an Fi value. I also think your Enneagram instincts come into play here: self preservational (self), sexual (one-on-one interaction), or social (the group) instincts. Whichever one comes first causes you to value that instinct above the other ones.
1	Why did you conclude you were an Fe user?
3	ENFPs and organization- What are your solutions?	I'm an ENFP in school, and i've been wondering about the most effective organization/work management strategies for people like me. I'm your typical spontaneous, all over the place, new-idea-every-minute ENFP, and obviously this leads to me being a procrastinator, at least at tasks and assignments I find uninteresting. \n\nMy question is: Would forcing an ENFP into a routine, organized work style help them become more well-rounded, or push them out of their comfort zone to the point of being unhealthy or stress/depression-inducing?\n\nThanks so much, and I hope this is able to help other ENFPs with the same problem!
4	I don't think an ENFP works well being forced into one way of working or one way of thinking or one way of organizing or whatnot. It breeds resentment and stress when the rules don't make sense to the ENFP. \n\nNot to say these aren't useful skills though. But you will need to try things out and see what works best for you, however obviously winging it isn't going to get the job done here. \n\nI'll plug what has helped me a lot, Marie Kondo. I don't follow her method to a T, but its been really helpful to me. and the method trickles down into almost every other aspect of my life. For me it has come with an understanding that everything in my life has its time and place, and sometimes i don't get to pick when it is something's time (usually I don't), but it has to be done and I'm the one to do it. I hope this helps in some way. But overall I encourage you to research effective organization and work management strategies and figure out what makes the most sense to you. Most things are going to make sense because order (in some way) makes more sense than disorder, which is why its important to not stop wherever you start. 
2	Actually I've felt that having a little bit of a routine and organized environment helps me a lot to actually be productive in my hobbies, by having a clear free time to work on them, \n\nfor example: \n\nEconomically I was able to get a full scholarship which helps me know that I have a stable income every month, and I dont have to worry about money.\n\nEmotionally I have a great relationship with my family and friends, have no partner for the moment, but that is fine I still feel loved and know I have people I can trust, also Im a little religious and praying every night really helps keep me at peace, so I dont have to worry about getting depressed.\n\nPhysically I was able to get into a workout program which I actually enjoy, but I get to not worry about my health and if I look unattractive, cause now Im objectively hot af, which helps to not have to worry about self-confidence \n\nProfessionally, Im in the job search part of my career, but because the other big parts of my life are so organized I can use all my free time to go all out on it, and once I get a stable job I wont have to worry about it and focus on my hobbies on my free time, and of course being a good employee, which will be easy if I have fun on my job\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR having organization and routine helps me eliminate things that would take too much brain space if I worried about them, giving me more brain power to tackle my new ideas and be happy 
1	What I did in school was have a monthly planner and write all my big deadlines on them, then smaller deadlines and look at it every day. I would also write down other important things in the planner(dates, concerts, etc). It's not a lot but it helped me to visualize all the dates and break things down.\n\nBut then again, apparently I'm pretty organized for our type. 
1	For me, I struggled doing homework regularly so I just kept reminding myself hoe happy my teacher (who I liked) would be if I did my homework and made that the motivation for doing it 
4	Brainstorming, Let me borrow you.	So, I'm reaching out to see if anyone has a better idea for my presentation.\n\nCurrently working as a Networking Consultant, and the company kickoff is next week. Each of the Network Engineers has to do a ten minute presentation  on how we are going to be more billable**(this really relies on the sales guys trusting us)** in the next coming year.\n\nNow I started this career path about two years ago and I didn't start professionally until 1 year ago, so I am incredibly new to this and learning everyday. So most expectations for me are to study and learn about the industry.\n\nMy Mentor told me that I am really humble with the other engineers which is great, but if I want to be a proper consultant I really need to let my ego properly shine. Customers will keep relationships with the engineer who talks the talk and walks the walk. \n\nSo my plan for the presentation is to talk about how I am going to develop my E.G.O.\n\nThree part presentation covering:\n\n**E**ducation(both past, and future)\n\n**G**uidance(this seems so brown nosy, so I am not too attached to this)(I work with guys who have been doing this longer than I have been breathing, and I have learned more from them than any book I have read)(Mainly this topic would talk about how the engineers are a team and work together on most projects not just the project lead)\n\n**O**rganization(blep)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCriticisms?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any better suggestion for what **G** could be or even a better Idea for the presentation in general, that would be awesome. I can roll on with this current setup for ages if need be, but I would love to hear what others think of this. \n\nThanks for your time
7	LOSE THE ACRONYM! Ok, now that that's out of my system, let me try to speak in a more civilized manner...\n\nLOSE THE GOODAMN ACRONYM!\n\nOk, that didn't work. Seriously though, your presentation  has to serve you, not the other way around. As witty as that acronym might sound, I bet your supervisor is more interested in results. Instead of wasting your time chasing words that'll vaguely represent whatever you have to say, think of the story you're trying to convey. What images are you trying to evoke inside their heads?\n\nPlus, when they say you have to work your ego, I'm pretty sure they mean it's a good _auxiliary_ skill to assist you in your negotiations should you need to assert yourself as the expert who knows what he's doing. \n\nHow do you feel about people that lead with their ego? I bet that's not a pretty picture that comes to mind. :)\n\nDoes that make sense? Let me know if that's helpful and perhaps I'll write some more if you find this useful. Good luck!
2	(Guidance part)\nGive them some tips, real life anecdotes (doesn't have to be real just make up sth good and present is as if it happened), don't bore them talking to much about team work, cause that much everyone knows.
2	I 2nd the losing of the acronym. It feels, off. Since I don't know your situation well I can't speak on what exactly you should speak about, but I believe that if should come from the heart and you should trust your gut. If you can hit on what makes you tick, you can harness that energy and I've found that works well for me in my speeches. I harness that energy because it's contagious. It moves people, and as a result of that people will be interested in you. The second step being following through when the work comes, and when it comes I hope you put your nose to the grindstone, because people will be paying close attention. \n\nHope that helps. 
47	When compatibility is not enough (an ENFP x INTJ love story)	She stepped into the stranger's car and they sped off towards Malibu. Because he doesn't drink. And he didn't want the typical first date. "You just want everything on your own terms, don't you?" "Oh, you have no idea."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe kept telling him about her extraordinary experiences and he keeps putting a frame of scientific language around them until she said...stop. You don't have to accept my experiences, but don't try to contain or reduce them. He felt silent and in the space of that silence she felt how desperate he is to believe everything she's saying. There was a push and a pull. A complementary way of thinking. They drove beyond Malibu and got out to look at the stars and the waves dashing the rocks. He told her about his ridiculous experiments in minimalism, where he kept taking stuff away from his life until it broke him. That's so dumb and so beautiful, she said. He says he thinks about going into the woods and living as some kind of neo hunter-gatherer all the time. I understand the impulse, she said. Modernity does push us into this life of meaningless desperation. But it IS our reality and running away from it is futile and ultimately very artificial. Then they talked about whether it's possible for any individual to be self-actualized without society being self-actualized in some way already. They both spent most of their twenties in a dead-end relationship and most of their thirties thus far single. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI thought I'd just be single forever, he said, but I've come around to just how good love feels. Too many people look for a lifetime of commitment when they can't even be committed to the moment, she said, isn't it beautiful to just keep choosing each other for as long as we can?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"But then how can you ever be secure?"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n "Are any of us ever really secure?" \n\n&#x200B;\n\n"I guess I just proved your point."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe was so sure after that night, even though they haven't as much as kissed, that she was in love. She made soup and baked bread for their second date. He shoved the food thoughtlessly into his mouth. "It's good," he said distractedly, before launching into a bitter, misanthropic diatribe that seemingly came out of nowhere. "If I actually cared about humanity," he said finally, "I'd probably work on software that would solve the healthcare problem. But I don't." Chilled to the core, for once she didn't know what to say. The evening ended with her showing him the door. "Please leave so I can stew in my own disappointment."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat was that. Except she somehow couldn't stop texting him. And he couldn't stop texting back. She feels an expectant rush every time her phone dinged. "People like you, don't they. They don't like me." "They all like me, but they don't get me." Once in a while, one of them would push to meet again, which would make the other one all squirrely and distant. They took turns doing this. This is exhausting, she thought. I need to stop. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe met the ESTJ at a French bistro for their first date. They clinked their their glasses and picked at a cheese plate. He's a manager at a French international company. He showed her the two cell phones he has with him at all times. This one is my tether, he said. I have to stay available in multiple time zones. The conversation flowed carried along by a scintillating stream of bubbly. "You're so free," he said. "You're so stable," she replied. Oh but nothing is more exhilarating than freedom. Ah, but after a while, nothing feels better than stability. His friends doesn't like it that he's been single for so long, he said, a single man feels out of place when everybody else is coupled up. He insisted on getting the check, and making a stupid detour on his uber so he can drop her off at her doorstep. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLater that night the phone dinged and she felt the familiar lurch. It was the ESTJ. Texting like the gentleman he is. When can he see her again? She tried to push down her disappointment. Of course the INTJ won't text her first. Not when she has been cold to him. That's not how it works.  She imagined herself at a party with the ESTJ and all his friends in coupley-couples, the ripples of well-to-do laughter. Wouldn't it be nice if she could be free enough and he could be stable enough for the both of them? But that's not how how it works either. 
13	The sweet spot is being completely secure in your own self so that you can love and appreciate other people's strengths, weaknesses, and different ideas and lifestyles
8	Fuck fuck fuck. I tell my friends all the time that love isn't for me. May you're right, maybe just choosing each other for as long as we can is all we get. 
11	The INTJ in this story is who I would have been into in my late teens / early 20s. At 29 he sounds annoying as fuck and that ESTJ sounds lovely. Making sure I get dropped at my door? Yes please! I'm too old for mind games, wondering how someone feels, waiting on replies, pessimism and nihilism. Give me the stable person with their shit sorted who I'm still excited to get a text back from. The stable person with their shit sorted who makes it clear how into me they are, where conversation flows easily, and we are chasing each other equally. Give me the stable person who wants to go on interesting dates and be silly and have adventures. Give me the stable person who makes me laugh every time we talk. Someone stable who I can have deep conversations with. I know that stable person is going to have my back and support me when life isn't going well. \n\nI fell passionately in love with an ESTJ woman like this. \n\nI'm currently dating an INFJ like this and have no chill about how much I like him already.\n\nStable does not have to mean boring. Stable can still make you feel excited. Stable doesn't have to limit your freedom. \n\nBy the way, I think you are a good writer. The part about the INTJ's reaction to the soup told me so much about the character.
5	What is this trying to express?
4	i did a cry
3	Keep going! OMG don't stop now... I felt this in my soul.
7	Beautiful writing.
7	The back and forth is the story of my (past) life. Settled down for an ESFJ with a strong (and surprising) adventurous streak.
7	I want to bang my head on my keyboard because of how much I relate to this story and how many emotions just ran through me. 
12	Fellow ENFPs, do you love yourselves?	I just wanted to ask if you guys like being an ENFP.\n\nFor me ... being an ENFP is amazing. I would never give up on my type. I love how we're able to come up with ideas in milliseconds. I love how we're able to feel empathy for other people so we can act upon good things. I love how we see a lot of nice things in this world even though others can't quite look at what we're thinking.\n\nDo you guys feel the same?
15	Big difference between loving being an ENFP and loving yourself as asked in the title.\n\nI love being ENFP but I hate myself for all the overthinking I do all day every day.\nI am my biggest fan while also being my biggest enemy.\nThat‚Äôs not ENFP exclusive though I guess.
5	Do I love myself? No.\nWho is myself? I am ideas? I am type? I am mood?\nYes when I get sad, or depressed. When I feel miserable. It is one of the rare moments, in which I know. That I need to love myself, accept myself. I embrace myself in those moments, love is just a by product, it's the state that follows the action I take towards myself.\n\nIn everyday life, I wish I could maintain love towards myself all the time. But I know that some of the ideas, some of the thoughts that I, have, are bleak in color. The comparison I make in my head is to the inspirational thoughts, which I value very much. And as a result of this value, anything underneath it, anything bleak: Gets repressed, rejected, or at least an in-difference to it, a neutrality at best.\n\nIt is easy to love your inspirational self, ideas that you find beautiful. But when you do that, you are discriminating between your good side and your bad side, so to speak. Can you love your weirdness, your bestiality, your cruelty? Your pathological sides? Can you empathize with **that**? Because we rather not to. Because if you can empathize with that. Maybe you are that? And then are you still this beautiful creature you've built yourself to be? Underneath all that, you're just a human being. Snakes and all. \n\n But back to your question. I don't think there's just a thing as loving yourself enough. It doesn't exist. But you can love yourself enough. Love yourself enough so you can be yourself. Whatever is left, is your purpose. Your path. Your lesson. Your feelings. Your self. And beyond that? Maybe you'll find the Self.
4	Too much. You get it.
2	Honestly am split between wanting to be an ENTJ or remain my ENFP self. My ENFP side says to help as many other people as I can, but my ENTJ side would make me capable of doing so most efficiently (while making me less empathetic).
2	A few things are at play. Do I love myself? Yes. I've worked on that, it wasn't always true, and it wasn't always easy. I love myself relative to my past self, and relative to how I feel about others. There is no one I value more in my life than me, and thats how it should be (i think).\n\nDo I love being an ENFP? eh. Sure. Its what I am (I think). I love being an ENFP as much as I love being my gender, or my sexuality, or whatever else could be a similar comparison. Its who I am, I didn't decide it, I had to accept it. Once I accept it I can understand the strengths and weaknesses, and work on improvement. I am never jealous of another type, I can value what others bring to the table though. I believe that there isn't anything that any type can't do, its just things come easier to some than others. This is why being a type isn't a limitation, it just is. 
2	I try to help other people too much probably. I feel like I‚Äôm worthless sometimes and it‚Äôs draining. Not really the ENFP of me just that I have pretty low self esteem. So much that I‚Äôm fine with hurting myself to aid others. I think I get my empathy part of being an ENFP from not wanting others to feel as worthless as I do sometimes. I think it‚Äôs getting better tho. I really do love all the things you mentioned and I would not want to be any other personality! I know I made it sound like I was some insecure depressed person but I‚Äôm not haha
2	I feel like my answer is kind of a projection of my idealism. \n\nI love my traits and my inspiration. i love being an ENFP. I love the endless future of possibilities that i can picture myself fulfilling. But i don't really love my reality, and how my ENFP traits practically manifest themselves. \n\nBasically, i'd make the most amazing book or movie character ever, but just not the best real-life person. I don't love myself now, but I still believe in myself. (sure hope that's enough!!)
2	OP yes yes yes to all the things you posted :) Sometimes I can get down on myself and self-critical but I really do love myself.  Even though I've made some huge mistakes underneath it all I'm really trying just not perfect.
2	I love the potential that I could become. But I guess I would rather be an ENFP if it meant having to lose the ability to feel on a deeper spectrum 
1	No I don't. I have zero self-esteem unfortunately. But I don't necessarily think it's the ENFP part of me that I dislike the most. It's my mental illnesses and being a highly sensitive person. Those things have made functioning in the world so much more difficult.
1	our people pleasing nature makes it super tough to love ourselves because we struggle with who we actually even are and also want to be authentically ya at our core. however, once i hit 30 (i‚Äôm 35), i really started to embrace me and shined in my own quirky way and have become increasingly in love with me. the less i sacrifice myself to make other people happy, the more i love myself. 
1	It's just not about me these days
1	I mean, I do? But not really. Depression is kicking my ass...
14	Self control?	Is it just a me thing or do some of you guys also sometimes have difficulty with self control. A thought comes up and off I go!
2	Yep. Impulsive doesn't begin to describe me. I should never be allowed to talk to salespeople, but everyone around me thinks I'm the responsible one. Its tough. 
1	yup, so me. 
1	It happens\n\n&#x200B;
1	Impulse control is super hard. I usually establish my level of impulse control when I walk into a room or something. Like, movie theater, have more impulse control....unless we are at the Alamo Drafthouse and it is a viewing party....then super low control, do all the things, and carry everyone's mood with my momentum!
397	Its me...	
17	Lmao why is this so accurate
24	Same. My room is an absolute mess and every time I try to clean it I get distracted by some random object that I forgot existed
10	You think this is bad, wait till you met the _N_Js who hate to clean their room even more than you _N_Ps.  At least the process of cleaning your room recharges you even if you do not want to do it =P\n\nYes I am ***whining*** as an INTJ who has a messy room who is laughing at me.
14	Lol this is so accurate I feel a little attacked
5	I've packed a d moved in the last two weeks.  Every time I need to close or open a box that's 45 minutes gone
3	This is charmingly hilarious.. INFJ with thumbs up to all you adorable ENFPs and anyone who cleans like this üòâ.
4	WOW this literally happened when I found not one but TWO old flower crowns in my room while cleaning üòÇü§£
4	When you cleaning browser tabs and end up with more tabs that what you started with
7	I was cleaning my drawers at work on Monday and I found pink lace rabbit ears so I put them on my head and walked around with them, went for lunch with them etc. \n\n&#x200B;
3	Entp here but also relatable
3	HAHA I relate but I don't clean
2	We are such a fun bunch to be around! 
0	Do ISTP's automatically dislike us?	I posted something on ISTP, and the way I see it it was not critical in anyway, just an observation mixed with a bit of humour.\n\nPeople are now passive agressively downvoting whatever I say, and I really don't get why. they are not even responding, just downvoting.\n\nNo clue what I did wrong lol
7	lol dude, you just went over there and said they would hate you (or us) without providing any further information. I respect that you are just curious but man, you gotta give them something to work with when you want some answers xD
4	No ISTPs do not automatically dislike ENFPs.\n\nYet ISTPs are kind of like cats, and if you enter their personal space or do things that are unpredictable to an ISTP (creatures of Ti and Se, the two weakest functions of an ENFP) the ISTP will hiss not to dominant or scold an ENFP but instead to say *help, help, I am being attacked* and I want my personal space again.\n\nGive the ISTP cat their personal space again, and they will just ignore the ENFP.  Ignorning is not the same as disliking.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>I posted something on ISTP, and the way I see it it was not critical in anyway, just an observation mixed with a bit of humour.\n\n>People are now passive agressively downvoting whatever I say, and I really don't get why. they are not even responding, just downvoting.\n\nWell that is your first mistake, for human relationships in the physical plane are naturally absurd if you look at it with a magnifying glass.  They may make sense in micro, but assemble enough macro and something will always be absurd / not make sense in a holistic fashion.\n\n***But the internet is different.*** Our sense of self is completely different with the internet for we have physical safety, we have anonymity, yet we do not have attention and emotional safety on the internet and this freaking confuses the body and mind for this is not something we evolved to handle.  Blah, blah, blah stuff with philosophy such as Sartre's "The Look" and more.\n\nLike I said before think of ISTPs as cats.  On the weird realm that is the internet, downvoting is the equivalent of hissing.  The problem is this behavior is absurd for it does not give the correct form of feedbacks that tell the person why you are hissing and there is NO USEFUL information communicated.  It is so basic of information communicated that true communication on the internet is often absurd.\n\nIf you only want upvotes and downvotes, and your emotions are going to be affected by this you are not going to be happy on the internet for the internet is a place that is a lot of noise and very little signal.
3	Well, for one, it's totally your fault, but it's also true that it's a problem area. \n\nConflict relationship in socionics. You've got no function in common. ISTPs are good at what you're bad at, and vice versa. I think both types recognize that, but the thing is, you don't value what they are good at and vice versa. That NeFi process of looking for new ideas and perspective that you like ? ISTPs suck at it, and they don't see the value in it.\n\nThey don't really like debating eitheir

35	Very typical convo with my ISFJ boyfriend	So I was helping my ISFJ boyfriend make his bed the other day and we had a conversation that made me laugh:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nENFP: why are we putting a top sheet on, we never use it?\n\nISFJ: Because that's how you make a bed....\n\nENFP: but we sleep on top of it half the time, it doesn't make sense and it's just more laundry\n\nISFJ:.....Because you're supposed to, this is how you make a bed\n\nENFP: But WHY?!?\n\nISFJ: JUST MAKE THE BED!
12	Borrows the words of a wise ISFJ\n\n>https://twitter.com/thatoneisfj\n\n>How ISxJs process Ne related info: all this WIDE OPEN SPACE contains so many possibilities of fucking things up, too much uncertainty omg can‚Äôt handle\n\n>How ENxPs process Ne info: WOW so many COOL opportunities! Think of all the awesome things I could do! What happens next?!\n\n>-----\n\n>How ENxPs process Si related info: UGH too many restrictions and routines cramp my style and make me feel caged in get me outta this SLUMP\n\n>How ISxJs process Si info: what a nice comfortable routine I‚Äôve got going, the world is predictable and safe, I feel so peaceful and stable\n\nJust make the damn bed ENFP, this is how the ISFJ recharges themselves.  You like Si don't you, the right amount of Si (the Goldilocks amount of Si, not too much and not too little, not too hot and not too cold) to the ENFP helps you self soothe, helps you recharge, and so on and so on.\n\n-----\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is said by an INTJ who has an ESFJ grandmother who insist on people making the bed with military precision or there were lectures for hour.  This same INTJ also had an ISFJ mother who was much easier in many areas compared to her ESFJ mother, but in other areas she was ***even more stubborn.***\n\nWhat I am saying /u/KGypsyB is I heart you and I understand üíû
6	Haha, I have escaped the tyranny of top sheets.  They are dumb and pointless and we NEVER make the bed üòÜ
6	I actually kind of understand your ISFJ.\n\nI mean, I think making the bed is stupid, because you're just going to get back into it and mess it up, so I don't do it until I'm about to get back in it (to make sure sheet and blanket are lined up and will cover me correctly).  The only people who are going to see it are me and the dogs, and the dogs care even less than I do.\n\nDuring the summer, I often completely remove the top sheet from my bed.\n\nOf course, I live in Oklahoma and have no air conditioning, so that top sheet is 100% unnecessary during the summer, so...
3	I said adios to my top sheet long ago! I do make the bed though, but that's to keep my doggo off the pillows where my face goes.. 
2	Hahahahahahahahaha omfg that's my sisters!!! Obviously they are ENFP and ISFJüòπüòπüòπ

11	Public speaking for ENFPs	I have to do quite a lot of public speaking and presentations for my job. Audience ranging anywhere between 10-200 people. \n\nI have a talk coming up in front of 1800 people next month üò±  \n\nI KNOW. \n\nHow do other ENFPs feel about public speaking? And does anyone have any tips or tricks to handle nerves when speaking in front of such a large audience?\n\nWe, or at least I, kind of thrive from attention but only for a little while before I want to hide away somewhere. And attention from nearly 2k people is a whole different ball game. \n\n(Can you tell I‚Äôm procrastinating from actually practicing my talk? üòÇ)\n
7	I love public speaking. Makes me nervous, sure, but it‚Äôs something I enjoy. I kind of just skim over everyone in the room as if they‚Äôre not there and I‚Äôm just at home practicing in front of my mirror. Definitely know what you‚Äôre going to say and have cues to remember them so you‚Äôre not constantly looking at notes at take a swap breath. Public speaking is the most common fear but people are far less judgmental that we think they are.\n\nEdit: it might also help that I consider Robin Williams to be an outstanding example of ENFP and as a standup comedian, he did a lot of talking to huge crowds. Try to emulate that maybe.
5	Love public speaking!\n\nThe ability to communicate ideas to a large group of people in one of the most personal ways imaginable is exciting to me.\n\nMy advice, prepare until you are confident in your material and presentation. As others have stated, people are less judgmental than they seem but also, people notice mistakes less than you would expect.
4	I'm terrified of public speaking, I get panic attacks even when I'm one of the people asking questions in a crowd after some speaker announces q&a and this is so conflicting because people view me as a great leader and I know I can deliver engaging and inspirational talks, just if I didn't get this crippling sensations every time I need to talk in front of people. I wish there was a sentence or two that could help me out like you are asking for. It doesn't help I have very thin skin and blush immediately, even when a person just says hi to me when I get excited to see someone.  But its probably nothing to do with enfp its just some baggage from my youth I guess. Sorry for being irrelevant it just gets me so emotional even thinking of public speaking. 
5	Not an enfp here, but I definitely suggest that you plan breathing pauses. I tend to forget to breathe and then I have to stop mid-sentence to breathe. That takes away the flow.
3	Remember to pause, breath, I try to remember that I am the master of the moment.
3	I'm an ENFP (tag is MIA). I get pretty nervous but I actually don't mind it. I find that the more personable you are and the more "yourself" you are on stage or up front, the easier the experience will go.
3	I can get nervous public speaking, but I don‚Äôt mind it too much.  When I was in college and had to do class presentations all the time, it was fun.
3	What helps is to find at least one person in the audience that is visibly enjoying what you are saying. In. A room of 1800 there‚Äôs bound to be at least one. Act like you‚Äôre talking to only them, but keep moving your head and address the full audience. Knowing that what you are saying is captivating at least one person is more than enough for me to relax, hopefully it helps you.
2	I usually do good with public speaking just be natural and do it like your talking one on one
2	Thanks all, keep them coming!
2	I hate it, but when the time comes I love it. My public speaking techniques changed with my instructor. He said he would storm into the room with the Imperial March at every speech and dominate. Before your speech, exercise a bit and chew some gum: just don't choke! \n\nOn the first few seconds you get up, people will already be judging you, but that doesn't matter, because you don't care about them and they don't care about you. Know your audience and answer their question: What do I get from this? How does this benefit to me?\n\nI was taught to have a particular selfish mindset in a way, yet it's true. Why care about everyone else right now? Who cares what I say? I don't care about anyone in the room, they don't care about me. I'm trying to look out for my own skin and they are as well. \n\nTake a deep breathe and smile before your speech, it really helps! I suggest note cards so when you get lost, you can pick up easily. \n\nRemember to have fun and be a badass. You're gonna do a great speech. Don't care about anyone or anything when you're up there. Pump yourself up with music and go!  
1	I love it. Feels like a get another injection of energy and wit. Found out I enjoyed it by making music and then performing. Now I do freestyle musical performances and spoken word and it makes me happy. 
1	terrified of it but i love it. 
1	I love public speaking. Just be yourself and sometimes it is best that you prepare a bit of your talk early. I mean we are good at talking spontaneously, but with the big amount of audience, better practice it first :) either way good luck!! U can do it!
4	Manic Pixie Scream Girl	Hai guys. I usually type as infp, but recently I‚Äôve been wondering if I could actually be an Enfp? I have suspicions that I lead with Ne, especially when I look at my relationship history.\n\nI would say that i‚Äôm a very adventurous and impulsive person, and I believe my loved ones would see me this way as well. I don‚Äôt always shy away from the spotlight and can easily entertain a crowd of people with no issue. The thing is, I do have periods of melancholy and do go into hermit mode every now and then. But I notice that if I spend too much time alone, I become restless xD\n\nLooking at past relationships, I notice that I entered them really quickly, had a lot of fun, and then got restless and disappeared. Idk if this is an enfp thing or a mental health issue..üß∏ My exes seem to refer to me as the one that got away because of how detached I can be. But I tend to be very fun and show people a good time in my company. I don‚Äôt know many infps that have these traits. But I can‚Äôt completely rule out infp because of my love for writing and intense introspection. I believe I am very in tune with my Fi as I am constantly checking in to see how I feel before making a decision.\n\nIdk, what do you guys think? Have any of you ever been caught between figuring out wether you lead with Fi or Ne?
3	Hmm, I just had a thought. I'm no MBTI expert, but from what I've learned our last function, also known as the Interior Function, tends to manifest itself through rebellion.\n\nNow, as you know, the ENFP and the INFP cognitive functions are exactly the same, they're just in a different order.\n\nWith that in mind, seeing as you're struggling to type yourself through your primary and secondary functions, perhaps the key lies in your inferior function!\n\nJust to give you an example, as any stereotypical ENFP, \nI have a hard time preparing meals and would much prefer if I could snack indefinitely--it's way quick and easier than having to prepare a whole meal. That's inferior Si manifesting itself, the part of me I have the hardest time accepting.\n\nDoes that make sense to you? I hope this helps!
2	i'd say you're an enfp\n\ni also wondered this question myself, but it's pretty well-known that enfps are the most introverted of extroverts, and so i guess this justifies the "hermit mode" \n\ni also have the restlessness thing with relationships! i tend to idealize, seeing the person as they could be rather than as they are. i fall in love with ideas more than people. then i'm disappointed, and i periodically go through phases of self-isolation when i see the person in a practical light. \n\nI'd say your infp traits can manifest just as much in an enfp as well. i also absolutely love writing and self-analysis as well! 
1	I have heard ENFP's always question if they are INFP's but INFP's never question if they are INFP's. We are the most introverted extrovert. We need a lot of alone time, like tons, to learn and analyze and decompress and enjoy the things we like. We are only the fun, silly, social stereotype a little bit of the time.\n\nI talked to an INFP guy a lot about our differences and the biggest was that because he led with Fi he needed everything to be related to him or his values or emotions for him to consider it important or worthwhile. Anything theoretical or silly or not personally related to him was not important. I did a creativity exercise where you imagine a spoon (or fork) and try to think of as many different ways it could be used besides for eating. I can think of 50 easily. But he couldn't really do it at all. So I had to frame it like he was on a desert island and only had a spoon and then he could think of things to use it for.\n\nSo for an INFP their Ne is incredibly limited, only used for things that pass the Fi test. For ENFP's we use Ne without limit, completely free and unrestricted. Then we pass it through Fi after (if applicable).
144	I relate to this on a different level.	
11	describe yourself in 11 words: "This puppy cant concentrate on one thing for 3 seconds"
11	Note that the puppy doesn't do anything. He doesn't smell the plant, he doesn't play with the ball. Make choices my dudes. Do both if you must but do something. You'll be happier. Also : WHAT A CUTE PUPPY. 
5	ENFP = shiny object syndrome 
2	Visual representation of my mind at any given moment. 
1	Awwwww
2	I just can't. give. up.	I am not so sure if this is having an ENFP brain, or typing as enneagram 8, or a combination of the both.\n\nWhen I have set my emotion (not mind, emotion) to something, I just have to win/conquer/finish it.\n\nOf course, as an ENFP, I have the tendency to not finish things, that is why it is important here to make the distinction between something I have to do like homework, or something I am emotionally attached to, or passionate in other words.\n\nWith an assignment I care about this means endlessly continuing till it's perfect in my eyes.\n\nWith women this means, not with all of them but especially now, that once I have sensed some possibility I will go on till I have her, or till I am emotionally destroyed and completely obliterated (has happened before lol).\n\nThis energy I feel gives me an enormous amount of strength, but it is also hard. It conflicts with the blockages that are also part of my system. On the one hand I am trying to go forward as fast as I can, but on the other I am withholding myself so much sometimes.\n\nwhat are your Thoughts, experiences, ideas, feelings?
3	Welcome to Te and Se.  Shadowed / Subdued Se in an ENFP still exists and it causes certain things you are describing.  Shadow / Subuded Se is not a valued function so sometimes it is super energizing and sometimes it is super frustrating and many other times it it has little value / it is neutral.\n\nAnd there are times where you take a trigger that starts with Se and are able to transform it.  The transformation of material / ideological things. And you ENFPs get super energized where you transform this into Te, this process can cause such pride.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat am I talking about?  Read this link which is a description for an ENFP.  *But read it out of order.*  Read the Se part and then read the Te part, and then read the 6 other parts, *IN THAT ORDER.*\n\nhttp://www.sociotype.com/socionics/types/IEE-ENFp/
2	I feel like this happens anytime someone would say, "This isn't something you could do anyway." WELL GUESS WHO IS GONNA BE PROVEN WRONG?!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI AM CAPABLE AND LIMITLESS!
1	I so get this. Sometimes in my head some people become this almost ethereal beings that I MUST get to know and I feel them on such a deep level that its mind boggling. I feel for them without even knowing them and I get all excited and I try very hard to connect. Usually it turns out it was in my head mostly and when the bubble bursts its not pretty. But I can't ever say to myself I'm sorry for not trying. And at the end its worth it because I feel live and this feeling... Its like the best drug in the world :D
11	Do you feel any kind of cultural pressure where you live that makes you suppress your true self?	
5	Fuck yes. I live/grew up in the deep south/bible belt and I couldn't be more excited to get out. I spent a semester in Rome for school and felt so free and like I could wear/do whatever I wanted without judgement.
4	FUCK YES! I live in japan where everyone likes to keep themselves inside their littlefucking bubble and I just want to go and pop it and make them stop being so square, shy and depressed and start having a lot of fucking fun, the sad part is I just end up getting tired of trying and start keeping myself in my bubble, but my bubble has friends that keep me sane, also getting drunk in bars helps a lot to loosen them up and gives me license to be my weird self
3	Raised very conservatively Christian in the south. And omg I couldn‚Äôt stand it.  I am living more north now but I still feel like I‚Äôm not myself. \n\nI love piercings and black and doc martens and keeping my hair shaved... and yea people are afraid of me, which is the complete opposite of what I try to achieve..
2	I‚Äôve had at least THREE DIFFERENT people suggest that the reason why I don‚Äôt have many close friends in my classes is because of my overwhelming enthusiasm and that I should tone down the energy. 
1	Any Asian in Australia
1	That is the nature of "The Look" \n\nhttp://existentialcomics.com/comic/235\n\nWe humans treat each other as subjects with subjective feelings we should respect, but we also treat each others as objects where we expect people to comply and confirm and we do all this **subtle** social pressure, and this subtle social pressure can be quite painful in acute ways but also in it can feel like weight is on our shoulders, literally "a tax" that is a weight on our shoulders.\n\n>Bad faith (French: mauvaise foi) is a philosophical concept utilized by existentialist philosophers Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre to describe the phenomenon in which human beings, under pressure from social forces, adopt false values and disown their innate freedom, hence acting inauthentically.[1] It is closely related to the concepts of self-deception and ressentiment.\n\n>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith_(existentialism)\n\nWhy the hell I am talking about existentialism I do not know?  I should have merely said YES. at the start of this response to your conversation. \n\nüôÇüíû
1	I have news - it's not culture. It's hard wiredbiology. They for example made tests on liberal, leftists white people and - a great shock - they were treating ethnics like some inferior people
1	I love in Alaska and Hans to check myself every now and then.  A lot of conservative folks who HATE liberals, so expressing my views needs to be done cautiously sometimes.  Especially as an Iranian-American.\n\nHowever, using my ENFP gifts I can usually get to know someone and frame conversation in a way that they‚Äôd have to call me a terrorist or say something offensive directly to me to express their views.  It‚Äôs actually been a strange slow process but working in carpentry I have the time to get to know people and change their minds.  It‚Äôs hard to call someone a gun hating liberal when they go hunting with you.\n\nIt‚Äôs an interesting place, and although there are a lot of classically conservative people I‚Äôve found you can never judge a book by its cover up here.

7	So, I need to pick at your brains... For research. And you get a small love-story in return.	Hey, to you I might be a breath of fresh air or the neurotoxin that will give you shivers as long as you breathe the air I'm in, depending on your experience with ENTJ's ((might be a tad over the top, and the ENFP I met was simply unhealthy)).\n\nNon the less, I come in peace. I have had the pleasure of knowingly meeting my second ENFP, and my impression is the opposite of my previous one. How opposite? The first one I met (in the army (which could be the reason for our issues, given how I am when I'm in leadership mode, AND in the army) ended with me seeing him as a breathing lazy nuisance (in his defense, the army wasn't really for him), and I ended up publicly shaming his lack of effort in anything that required it and complete ignorance towards anything that required him to pay attention and sacrifice 30min to anything that required him to do something he had to put effort into and wasn't entertaining to him. \nBut this isn't why I'm here now if you want to read all of that story, it's in here as well (bosted back in 2015, if I'm not mistaken).\n\nNow, for the main course, context. \n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî(etc etc) \n\nNow, I have had the pleasure of meeting my second ENFP, a female, and I can tell you right now that I have never struggled with controlling my emotions... Until I met her.\n\nYes, I'm in love, and I'm both excited and afraid of how the floodgates of all my affectionate, loving, caring, protective, almost possessive and straight up horny feelings, are trying to burst through anything that might pose as a hindrance for them to reach this scaringly perfect match.\n\nI don't know how well you know ENTJ's, but I don't put a lot of effort into relationships I don't see a future for. \nI have only told one girl that I love her, and I'm 24 years old (been in a few relationships though).\nI am very aware of my emotions, especially when they are a response to other people, and I am very good at resolving/calming/ignoring them if I don't gain anything from showing them (what I mean by gaining is everything from friendship, to climbing over others to get that promotion).\nYou get the idea.\n\nAnd no, this is not me bragging, I'd almost say that this is the opposite. I'm just painting a picture.\n\nBecause up until now, this woman is almost perfect, and I am for the first time in my life, terrified of screwing up with a girl, and of the way I am moving our relationship forward.\nBut, for some unbelievable reason, she responds with an almost childlike ecstasy whenever I lose my posture and gives the relationship a push forward. Why am I terrified of pushing it forward? Because for once in my life, for some fucked up, unknown reason, I am pushing it forward at my speed. And instead of jumping out of the car, every time I speed up a little, she lifts her hands up and laughs... What the fuck is wrong with you guys?\n\nMy current theory is that culture is a big part of it. She's from Ukraine.\n\nHow we met (you can skip to the next "‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî" if it's of no interest):\n\nI saw this "worldwide social/dating app" add on Facebook, and for some reason decided to test it out... \nWhen I created the account, I was bombarded with messages from girls almost instantly, which ofc, in this day and age, rose my suspicion, so I decided to run some control checks. I bought the cheapest "point package", and replied to one message, from the most attractive girl, with the least "whory/desperate" opener. \n"Hey, nice to meet you, would you like to video chat?" this was to see if she was a bot or not. Which she wasn't. And she was just as beautiful as on the pictures, maybe even more if I dare say since she wasn't wearing make-up, but still almost stunned me by how cute she was.\n\nI wasn't sure what to say, my next immediate thought was "they're getting paid for this...". \nHer first words were "omg, you're actually handsome!" which made me even more suspicious. This isn't how the women I have in my country play, where's the "I'm just browsing" attitude every girl who looks like that seem to have? \nI responded with "look who's talking!" why the fuck would I say that? Just boost her ego like that? My "game" had abandoned me like she probably would the second I didn't take the lead in the social dance we all (in the west at least) waste our time on, to scare away guys that are too sweet and innocent to stand through even one "shit-test" that most girls in that league would serve them...\n\nShe was covered her face like a shy girl and made a small high pitched "iiiiii", and got red as a tomato... What the fuck, where's the reality I know and despise (for its inefficiency), right?\n\n\nWe carried on with some standard introductory small-talk, and then my points ran out. I had some left and thought I'd conduct my last test. Is she paid for this? \nI asked her if we could move to another app like Snapchat or Facebook to continue our talk there... For free! And she said she didn't have it, and that she couldn't download it for some reason... And she didn't have a computer. \n"haha, busted." I thought... \n"but I do have 'telegram'! Add [phone number]" \n\nWtf? Is this real? \nWe moved on to that app and bonded over text, and I got her to create a WhatsApp account so we could call with video. And things moved rapidly. \n\n-skipping ahead to a relevant/surprising point-\n\nShe did admit that she actually does get paid a percentage of the points guys spend, and she's there to earn money on the side, nothing else (girls, pm me if you want to know the app, and live outside of the US. Guys, it's a waste of time)...\nBut for some reason, I, after she's been on that app for 2+ years, pushed the right buttons for her to want to get to know me more.\nMy ego shot through the sky when she told me, I had to switch my tranq-gun to fully-automatic to calm it down again. \n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\nShe told me that she's an ENFP, and I immediately put that to the test, because of my previous experience with your kind, but she passed with flying colors! \n\nNow, I've been videoing/texting with her every day, making time for each other (I have my job and side-projects, and she has worked and is a law student, but I still do everything to make time for her, and she does the same, surprisingly) since early  last December, and now I've booked a trip to Ukraine to meet her in mid-February... \n\nWe are at the stage where we both say "I am glad in you" - \n(I took a leap of faith and told her that I want to say that, English is a pretty simple language when it comes to expressing levels of love, so to not scare her away, I explained to her the five different levels we express affection in Norwegian, and with a crude direct translation, that is what we say in Norwegian before we say the equivalent of "I love you", which is something I only say when I (at least, not saying that all Norwegians treat those words with the same respect as I do) am at the point where I know I'm ready marry you) \nbefore we f.ex. hang up. And I've daringly explained to her, with some restraint (I know pretty quickly if I want to go all in or not, I'm not sure other people are) how I feel about her, and shes openly said she feels the same way. \n\nNow, I realize every time I take a leap of faith like that, she seems to feel the same way, and it scares me every time, because of how unusual that is for me, and the girls I'm used to dealing with (in the west, the culture for girls in Ukraine is pretty damn welcoming for guys from the west who treat women in the "old fashioned way" i.e, with respect) girls who would react in the exact opposite way (given that they have the looks to match, my woman (fuck, I'm already seeing her as mine) is "model-good looking", I've dated 3 models in the past, and I'm not exaggerating about her).\n\nSorry for all the brackets, I tend to do that when I want to be detailed... \n\nSo... Given that I've provided you with (hopefully) and an entertaining and way too detailed/long story and a peek inside the ENTJ brain, unfiltered... \n\nCould you help me out? Even though things are going surprisingly well, I am still speeding blindly. I have little to no experience with ENTP's, and I really don't want to mess this up! \n\nAnd no, I'm not going to follow your advice blindly, it will all be a reference in the back of my head. I just need some form of the idea of how ENFP's think/acts, all insight is welcomed.\nBut my Te is panicking, as it has too little experience to confidently move along on...\n\nGive me whatever you have, a description/perception of love, sex, mindset etc, as long as it's informative. Heck, I'll even take your general feedback on my situation, and if you wonder or need some more info about me or our situation, just ask! \n\n\nThe textwall ends here. \n\nTL;DR? Then I don't need your comment. If you don't have the time to understand my situation, then I doubt you'll be able to provide me with useful feedback. \n\nEdit: excuse any bad grammar, I'm not a native English speaker, it's 07:23 in the morning, I haven't slept anything, and I wrote all this shit on my smartphone. \n\n2nd edit: fuck it, I'm not going to get any sleep now anyway. Corrected some spelling that I noticed.\n
2	You know what bro, your situation fucking rocks!, we as ENFPs go all out on love, and if she has already showed that much interests as long as you dont fuck up too hard, she will keep being hooked, we love loving and once we are really into someone we completely fall for them and sometimes blindly like everything about them , even the things we shouldn't. show real interest in her, in how her mind fucking works, and help her through her mood swings, get to know what she is feeling without her saying anything, and just be your genuine self, throw out all the "game" advice that goes against what you really want to say and do to her.
1	I would love some tips regarding warning signs to look out for. I am terrible with "hints", so knowing some ways enfps show their warning signs on would be great.
1	I am really glad I took the time to read your story. It reminded me of a little 4 month fling I had with an ENTJ cop once (he might have been an ESTJ..his S/N axis was pretty 50-50 divided). Anyways, how fast to take things was one of the major areas we struggled with. He had a lot of past family issues from his parents getting divorced. He‚Äôd say things in the heat of the moment like seeing himself moving towns to be closer to me if things continued as they were. I only got to see him once per month because of the distance though, and that was tough on me. I pushed the progression a little harder than he was, and that ended it suddenly. There was a ‚Äúpros and cons discussion‚Äù about us continuing and to him there were more cons, and that was that! It sucked but we are still decent acquaintances and have both moved on. He actually texted me the week to say he was moving in with a girl after dating her for 3 years! He was like ‚Äúremember how tough that was for me??‚Äù Haha he still seemed terrified, but I didn‚Äôt point that out. I had one other experience with an ENTJ, who was ‚Äúall in‚Äù with me. I was kinda ‚Äúmeh‚Äù towards him (just wasn‚Äôt super strongly physically attracted, it sucked) and he said I hurt him pretty badly, but he moved the hell on. We stayed friends though too. \n....\n....\n....\nMy observation is that ENTJs are either all in, or they dip their little toe in to test the waters before breaking off the commitment! Sounds like you have your ‚Äúall-in‚Äù girl, no?

Does that sound accurate?

49	How do you guys choose something to commit to?	I have so many interests and ideas that I seriously cannot choose which one to pursue. I love music and can sing well, so I want to do music. I am smart and love building computers so I want to start a computer repair shop. I love analyzing restaurant ambience and want to get into interior design. I am passionate about car bodies and would love to learn 3D modeling to design them. I am a great cook and love food and want to start a burger food truck. I want to make skits with my friend and be a YouTuber. I want to get into local acting.\n\nI want to do all these things but if I commit to one I don‚Äôt get the others. I really want to be good at something though, but I cannot seem to get myself to focus on one thing, and therefore none of the things get done. \n\nHow do you guys cope with this? I‚Äôm tired of being unproductive when I know I could be great at any one of these things if I set my mind to it.
21	I feel you, I am also constantly pulled in different directions. Its hard, but the trick is to understand that if you pick one it doesn't close the door to the others forever. Think through these different interests or passions, write down what capital investments you would need and some benchmarks to hit to keep you on track. Have a goal in mind, and when you reach that goal you can re-evaluate if you want to keep going down that path or if you want to switch it up and start a new journey. But reaching a defined goal or end point is a nice time to walk away, and there are going to be souvenirs to keep to remember the journey. \n\nRegardless of the paths you take, you'll learn a lot about yourself and others along the way. 
9	When you find out let me know. Maybe you could own a restaurant/computer repair shop. You're the cook who puts on live performances. You're restaurant has food trucks. In your down time (lol) you go to school for the 3d modeling. All of this is recorded daily on your YouTube channel. \n\nHey an enfp can dream right?
15	Honestly I'm going through the same thing. Have you ever listened to Jordan Peterson's bit on Peter Pan and the Man-Child? It's pretty damn interesting as an ENFP. He talks about how a child is nothing but potential, and how that's okay. But as you become an adult, you sacrifice your potential to become competent within something, and once you're competent you have more freedom to pursue more things later. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjfClL6nogo&t=71s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjfClL6nogo&t=71s)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy own bit here: You more you think, the more you freeze. As an ENFP I think myself into solitude and anxiety. I think, "What if this isn't it?" Because I too, like many things. Music, roleplaying, philosophy, psychology, leadership... etc. How do I choose? Well The way I see it is that if I act and move forward in life,  maybe that will bring me more meaning. Maybe that will teach me what I really care about and what I don't. I know that I'll meet friends in the path, and maybe those friends will open up more paths for me. So maybe you just have to choose one and go with it. If it doesn't work out, you don't have to hold onto it. If you were holding a hot cup that was burning you, you wouldn't keep a hold of it. You can put things down, emotionally, and that's okay (I know as ENFP I get really attached to things). I don't know. I don't want to add too many cliched metaphors for you, and I don't want to come off as a know-it-all. I simply want to help you on this journey we are on as people and as an ENFP and I think you should just act, and see where that takes you. That's at least what I've been telling myself. I would love to hear your input. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck on your journey!\n\n&#x200B;
3	If you can't decide what you like most, think about what are some prett cool secondary Things. I chose to Go into IT (not art history) because I liked both, but IT gave me more options for pursuing jobs and changing them if I didn't like them.
4	Ask my INTJ.

4	You can kill many birds with one stone.\n\nFrom what I can tell, you can\n\n    - combine your passion for computers and 3D modelling\n    - develop a good sense of aesthetics with interior design\n    - pivot that sense of aesthetics into your acting\n    - use your acting skills to make effective YouTube videos\n    - start making YouTube videos where you cook and have a laugh with your mate\n    - use YouTube revenue to buy that food truck\n    - start vlogging your aesthetic food truck travels around the world\n    - use that massive income to give the truck awesome body mods\n\nAt that point, you have won life. But something still bothers you. A small piece is missing. You\n\n    - give away your wicked food truck\n    - have a breakdown, become homeless and lose everything\n    - start wondering what is life actually for\n    - find a broken laptop in the bin, repair it using your skills\n    - go to the closest lunch cafe and analyse its ambience\n    - ask the owners for the wifi password\n    - go on Reddit\n\nSo what I'm wondering is... it really necessary to be very good at something?
3	I suggest that you focus on the passions that will be most rewarding to you in the long run. I'm in my 40s and wish I'd had the foresight to focus and get my priorities in order so that by now I could be comfortable and able to afford to enjoy my other passions. I focused on having fun and avoiding stress/sacrifice and not wanting to play politics et cetera and now I have no savings and am solely managing because I have a pretty good support group of family members and friends. I appreciate the help but I'm not comfortable mooching. I would love to start earning money so I can repay them. \n\nIt seems kinda tacky to want money as opposed to more lofty things but sadly that's how the world works. The lack of a steady income, health insurance, and other factors have kept me depressed for quite a while. With over a decade of professional experience as a corporate trainer in the Philippines, I immigrated to the U.S. four years ago and haven't been able to land a corporate training gig since. It gave me a chance to try jobs I never would have considered in the past, such as retail, and I appreciated the experience. But it also did quite a number on me, confidence-wise. I now know that culture shock--which I wasn't anticipating--can be a long process.\n\nMy current game plan: I'm still gonna stick to my principles and be as authentic as possible, but I'm not gonna be as picky when it comes to acquiring income. My resolution: Earn mo' money.\n\nAfter four years of complacency and a miserable holding pattern, I'd like to think that I'm ready for a change and am looking forward to a new adventure.\n\nI wish you luck. I wish me luck.
3	ugh speak to my soulll.. I think part of the problem is that we can see the greatest potential of anything from the start.. the idealized end result of each pursuit.. and they're all amazing.. and it's like how do you turn down any of those? it's like we can *feel* them and know that they're possible (i.e. seeing yourself years in the future as a brilliant songwriter performing at Madison Sq Garden after your first guitar lesson or something).. and when something feels so vivid/almost real in your imagination already, it feels like you're *giving up something amazing* (the potential outcome) even though you never technically had it.\n\nit's k we'd probably take over the world without this Achilles.. prob better for the rest of mankind.
3	Just gonna give you a simple answer. I try to commit to something that I think will always be anle to surprise me in some way, or be interesting you know. 
3	I had the same issue when I was younger (and still do tbh). I went with my gut at the time. This doesn‚Äôt mean I was right though. I pursued one interest and found myself always going back to the other ones I didn‚Äôt pursue. I was equally interested in going to school for psychology and art. I started art school but didn‚Äôt finish. Went back to school for psych and got my BA. Now I‚Äôm applying to grad school but my interest in art has been in full swing again so I‚Äôm trying to be strict and learn from tutorials and giving myself deadlines with art projects. \n\nI guess it‚Äôs about flexibility and the balance of a hobby and a career. Just because you commit to one thing doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt explore something else. \n\nGood luck \n\nEdit: to clarify, going with my gut didn‚Äôt make me wrong either. Just well versed in multiple interests. 
2	time management is kinda my dictator.  But my personality is one of a nefarious little anti-authoritative rapscallion who keeps narrowly missing execution.  I do this by provoking deadlines as if they were the bite of a dragon and then at the last moment, slitting the throat of a project.  It requires the adrenaline of always being almost late and intensely perfect.
1	Hmm, sounds a bit like you're experiencing these different aspects in your life and saying to yourself, I can do that, but better!  It's probably true, but it's also easy to lose sight of the grunt work and discipline required to get there.\n\nIt might help to do a little research into how long some of these areas of interest take to master.  Can you see yourself spending 10 hours a day flipping burgers, cleaning your food truck, then spending the rest of the day buying supplies, figuring out how to advertise and where to drive?  Don't let the work get you down, anything worth doing is going to require work, but some are better than others.  Never hurts to ask either.\n\nJust do yourself a favor and don't go down the path of comparing yourself to others.
1	I just go as far as i can with each of them, to see what I like best and what flows the best w me, until I literally have to pick\n\nAlso, for me it's choosing between working at a zoo/conservation, and working in civil rights law . So my criteria is which I'm most passionate about, which is most important, and which I'll be best at. I'll never be able to stop wondering what could have been, so I never shut doors and always keep my options at least somewhat open.\n\nAnd, you can keep hobbies. Once you get successful enough you can open a food truck on the side, etc. Or create a new establishment. Like a chain restaurant with a food truck, and you and others sing in live performances
1	What are your core values?  What brings you most fulfillment?\n\nI listened to Jordan Peterson in one of his lectures and I started hearing a theme of more so Who you want to become rather than what do you want to 'do' ? and that made me narrow it down. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think this is the test that helped me recently\n\n[https://www.onlinepersonalitytests.org/corevalues](https://www.onlinepersonalitytests.org/corevalues)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;

2	Weekly Support Thread	\n/r/ENFP has always been and will always be a place that lends an ear. Large or small, get it all off your chest. In this corner of the internet, you will be heard. We are here to support one another. We are all we have.\n\nThis doesn't replace the individual posts; it's just another avenue to start talking, MBTI related or not. Sometimes you need to check in more than once before you feel restored. That's what we're here for.\n
2	I'm just here for some ENFP advice, but it's nice to see that you're sticking up for each other!
2	Any of you enfps working or studying in stem fields?	How is your experience? Do you enjoy your work? Do you face any difficulties? How would you compare yourself to your peers? There are fewer enfps in stem fields, what motivated you to join this field? What advantages do you have in this field as an enfp over other types? Do you have any advice for other enfps in this field? Answer whatever questions you like.
2	I am a Family Physician/General Pracitioner ENFP - disadvantages are definitely that I spend way too long talking to patient's about non medical issues which often gets me in trouble (being behind schedule). Advantages are being able to interact with people from all walks of life and hearing incredible stories.  I would recommend the health care sector for any ENFP's out there. 
3	Bryan Dechart (the actor who plays Connor in Detroit: Become Human) and his girlfriend Amelia Rose Blaire are just the perfect ENFP couple!	Hey guys! I was just curious about hearing your opinion on that topic, and was so glad that my sister introduced me to this game a couple of weeks ago.\n\nMaybe some of you were already fortunate enough to dive into this masterpiece of a game (if not, and you have a PS4, definitely do it!) and did also watch Bryan's and Amelia's gameplay of their own characters in the game.\n\nI've just watched a video of them and am just so certain that both of them are ENFPs in real life! Perhaps I've missed something, what do you think? If you had to type both of them based on this video, what would you say?\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GXzBeAs4Wc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GXzBeAs4Wc)\n\nEnjoy your day, folks. Cheers! :)
7	How can a guy attract ENFP girls ? A crush post	I just wanted to say that I always am crushing really hard on ENFP women (most E-types, actually ) :P .   I have a huge, huge, like yuge crush on Ellie Kemper ( watched The Office and Kimmy Schmidt multiple times now because of her).    \n\n\nIts a bit funny because I am quite an introvert, and my mannerisms and gestures are polar opposite of the aforementioned type of girls I want to attract. What can I do to attract more extroverted girls in my life?  Because of my job (I work as a researcher, obviously), my social circle involves somewhat more introverted women.   How can I increase my chances?  Help a guy out.  
16	So I'm an ENFP. What turns me on it teasing or silly banter. I like to be shown new things. You have to be willing to talk A LOT. Don't try to control me, I'll run. Be spontaneous as opposed to having your days planned. Surprises, attention, seduction. Intelligence. Dont let us walk on you. Have boundaries. I love dating writers or anyone passionate and exciting. \n\nHow to attract me? Be relaxed and funny, show me your skills but in a subtle way. Ask me lots of questions about myself. Be open and not critical. Try to show emotions and be able to listen to my long, circular rants. \n\nDon't hold me to a schedule, it doesn't work. Be willing to "share" me with others. \n\nHope this helps! 
7	I can't speak for all ENFP women, but I know these are some of the things I like in a guy. I always find funny guys attractive. Witnessing guys being kind and sweet always leaves an impression on me. Respect is a big deal‚úä Compliments always make my day, even though I don't know how to accept them all the time lol. I'd recommend dressing fairly decent most of the time. (But once you get with an ENFP then I'm sure they won't care what you wear and will love you for your dorky comfy clothes). Also! ENFPs take criticism to heart so try not to say something that could potentially hurt their feelings. I know I get butt hurt pretty easyüòÇ Introverts are actually very interesting to me personally so you shouldn't try to be too extroverted to get an ENFPs attention, but I do suggest that you initiate a conversation that could potentially lead into a deep talk about life or anything philosophical. \nHopefully this helps some! Good luck!
3	How to attract me?  Be breathing. \n\nJust kidding. Well... kinda. haha. \n\nStroke my intellectual/philosophical side and talk a little bit on the deep side.\n\nGood luck! 
3	I think as an INTP (or for INTJs. Goes for both, since same strengths), you don't have to do much. ENFP seems to like us for whatever reason. \n\nThe problem is more managing to interact with them once they are attracted to you. Seems like they are actually quite shy.\n
3	Be yourself, we're naturally drawn to intuitive introverts because there is a lot of good ideas and conversation stored inside of you guys, we are the most introverted of the outgoing types so be aware that we like our independence too and may seem half shy if we're nervous around you.  \n\nSpeaking for myself, I'm a little old fashioned I feel compared to my generation, so while I may hint about a date I'll never straight out ask a guy on a date, makes me feel undesired, and every female wants to feel desirable, \*more so\* than men often based on different priorities that each gender values more, combination of social norms & biological instincts.\n\nBe yourself, be kind and talk about what is important to you, if you guys value the same things and share the same worldview and passion it could be a positive start 
3	lollllll this somehow makes me giggle lol. u r like a shy guy can't hold ur secret anymore and decide to confess loud and clear hahaha.  very intp. (in my opinion )\n\nhmmm so I think having the same value of life and wanting to have the similar life styles, are ultimate keys of long term relationship.  then personailty compatibility and the skills of managing relationship. so I think despite from personailty attraction, you have to make sure you know the things above enough, so that as you know yourself more clearly you attract the people who have similar values as you. I think this is what built the stablerelationship . \n\nhowever ,  if you are only asking for attraction:\n\nif you are looking for extroverted girls only then the goals are pretty wide,  I would think E people like company and showing affection in general. if you are looking for enfp, be creative. decisive. hardworking. open minded and knowledgable. YOU REALLY DONT NEED TO BE LOUD AND EXTRAVERT to attract us :) some of things we really don't like : very dry talk. boredom. judgment . inflexibility. cynical. negative. and horrible people.
2	I absolutely LOVE when a guy compliments my intelligence. This may be only a thing that I do, but I always look for the most reserved guy in the room and kind of watch to see what he smiles/laughs at during the group conversations to gauge whether we'd be compatible. I think you can determine a healthy amount about people by watching their behavior in a group setting. If I think there's a chance we could get along, I try and physically relocate myself closer to him in hopes that he'll be more comfortable making a move. And if he doesn't, I do lol. I'm more extroverted and pretty much only date introverts so I think you are right to try for an ENFP!
2	well.. Im a dude, but you know what would be awesome, if you can get to know the girl so well that you can know without her saying anything when she is having a mood swing, we can sometimes just feel down for no apparent reason and if you where to see that  and ask her whats wrong while saying that she can trust you, you wont judge and youll listen, shell die for you. the way you say this is very important cause ive had friends notice im feeling down but they dont encourage me to deal with it they just point it out, and it feels so awesome to have someone really genuinely care about you that much. but at the beggining just be willing to show interest in them and be super fucking warm!, good luck
2	Creative mind, lot of ideas, new things, willing to talk, doing something unusual. We dont like anyone who sits home only. We enjoy moving out of our comfort zone.\n\nJokes and fun, but nothing cheap. Nice silly gifts. Give your ENFP you know quite well and you want her some small gift - like bring her favourite cake/coffee/little chocolate/flower etc and leave it on a desk or send it to her via delivery (not coffee most probably but others). Show her you care.\n\nDont try to control us. Let us having our space and some time alone (so if we stop communicate, doesnt mean you did smtg wrong)
2	i think in this case, your type works in your favour! as an ENFP, i love the idea of being able to "crack" the introverts and get to know them. Humour is a very solid first step. Although ENFPs tend to naturally join the more social, popular circles, they have a certain need for quirky, funny introverts to help balance things out. \n\nBe witty and sarcastic, and don't try to "fit in" with the extroverted crowds.  Individualism, even when it's quiet, is what we value. At parties, we'll pick out the people that are a little unconventional, and we're drawn to them.\n\nWhen you're trying to start up a relationship, play a little hard to get. We can be flighty and get bored with "easy" people, so make sure you dont pour all your feelings out too soon. (THIS DOES NOT MEAN: dont get into deep conversations with us. on the contrary, please please do) Just keep a little mysterious. \n\nSorry if this doesn't make a ton of sense, just my personal take on it! Good luck!
2	Thanks for this OP, and the responses.  I‚Äôm INTP and have found out that ENFP are freaking catnip to me.  I don‚Äôt really understand why, being so different in many ways, maybe we balance each other out...idk. But somehow I love y‚Äôall haha\n\n\n\n
1	Idk for other ENFPs but for me it would be be really kind, sweet and romantic, as well as teasing hehe :)
1	One thing to know is that ENFP's are the most introverted extroverts. We can be fun and silly and like big fun children (in a good way) but that is only some of the time (honestly like 30%). The rest of the time we like t e alone and learn and analyze and process.
6	How does Ne feel to you?	As an Ni-user I'm curious about how Extroverted Intuition is experienced as a Ne-dom. Maybe that helps me better if you guys could try to describe your experience with it (I could ask the ENTP-sub as well but Im only following u guysü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)\nThanks already!
7	Im also very curious about how Ni works, please tell me!!\n\nFor me Ne is mainly like thinking about a hundred things at once, and wanting to do many things. Like jumping from a browser tab with guitar lessons, to one where Im reading about game design theory, designing your profile web site, while talking to my sister on instagram and writing this post, all while in the middle of class (and totally getting ehat it is about, even though I didnt necessarily listened to every single word teacher says).\n\nAlso is like when im telling a joke I can come up with the weirdest of things, like  walrus intestines trafficking as a viable profession for the protagonist of said joke.\n\nIs like when writing something, a report, story, whatever, you start with one point or message you want to focus on and in the middle of writing it you get so many new ideas and you end up re-writing and erasing a lot of stuff, revising it to make sure it makes sense while reading it, cause it made sense in your head, but sometimes when checking you notice is a mess and its time to fix.\n\nIts like wanting to have a thousand different jobs, like being a game developer that is also the guitarist of a thrash metal band, while also being a super successful writer and comic artists who owns his own bar. and actually find the time to work on all of them(this may be more thanks to Te), even though is usually better to focus the majority of the time in your main passion, which is hard to define but not impossible.\n\nIT FEELS AWESOME\n\nI think that's what Ne is for me, maybe I'm wrong, maybe Im an undercover CIA agent trying to get an answer from you so I can get your location via awesome hacking and track you down and kill you for being responsible for Global warming and the decay of western civilization, or maybe Im just a product of your imagination, anyways, hope this helps in any kind of way
3	That‚Äôs kind of a hard thing to describe... given we‚Äôre Ne doms, Ne is a fundamental part of our experiences... but if I had to put a finger on it, I‚Äôd say (for me) it‚Äôs almost like being able to look at all the possibilities of how to use something. This is why I am a hoarder, there‚Äôs just so many uses for things, so I should keep it in case I need it later.
3	In my personal experience Ne is like having previously lived a thousand lives yet they all happened in the future and memories of all that experience appear when triggered by thought or sight both intentionally and unintentionally. 
3	Hi, ENTP bug here. What all the NFS are describing (except the one about the thousand lives) is pretty accurate for people of my type. \n\nIt‚Äôs like starting a workout routine someone made for you and 3 pushups in, you decide to add jumping jacks because it seems to make sense. \n\nIt‚Äôs pulling a recipe from a google search and then partly through your thoughts say ‚ÄúOOH! You could try putting this seasoning in!‚Äù \n\nIt‚Äôs making plans to hangout with a friend one to one, and then halfway through planning you consider adding other people to the mix because what you‚Äôre planning might be even more fun with these other people around. \n\nI‚Äôve noticed in my verbal communication there‚Äôs a lot of cuts in ideas:\n\n‚ÄúI like this song beca- and this isn‚Äôt based off of what you‚Äôve said earlier... kind of, but I‚Äôm not like trying to copy you - but I like this song because it reminds me of a time when...‚Äù\n\nWhen we‚Äôre REALLY on with our Ne, oh boy. Those cuts in ideas are permeated throughout the convo
2	A good explanation is that Ni is like finding a needle in a haystack. Ne is like finding a haystack in a needle. You can look at a ton of information and divine the best choice and then progress it forward to how it will develop (from what I understand of Ni). On the other hand we can look at one thing and expand it out to every possible way it can develop and be different or better.\n\nA creativity exercise I like is to think of a spoon (or fork) and think of as many different things it can be used for besides eating with. This seems to me like a very Ne Dom thing to do/enjoy. I even tried to do it with an INFP and he couldn't really do it that well because he led with Fi so needed things t be important to him before using Ne. But the thing about Ne Dom is it is first, thus without limit, unrestricted. It doesn't care about reality, logic, what is possible. It just is purely creative and brainstorming and imagination. Yeah some of the possibilities won't work but to limit is to limit creativity. Better to just think of possibilities freely then narrow after.
1	in my (probably biased) opinion, it's brilliant!\n\nas a Ne-dom, I can see all the outcomes of almost every situation. I can see connections and patterns, especially in people, and i can imagine endless possibilities and decide on the direction i value the most. I can easily incorporate new information and other people's viewpoints into my plans, and find it easy to be spontaneous and adaptable. \n\n&#x200B;
1	A million possibilities fly into my mind, sometimes all at once. It is hard to choose which thoughts and words are appropriate for the situation. I notice connections, such as relationships and communication styles. I look for the theory that goes with the situation I am seeing before my eyes. All of those things I just said. Lol
11	Why does everyone use abbreviated terminology, such as "Te", "Si", etc?	I find it annoying and confusing, but maybe that's just because I feel out of the loop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan someone please explain?
15	**Si** is introverted **S**ensing, **Se** is extroverted **S**ensing.  Notice in the abreviation the 2nd level is telling you the direction (introverted or extroverted) for the Sensing.\n\n* **Ne** is extroverted i**N**itution, **Ni** is introverted i**N**itution.  Another (perhaps better) name for initution is pattern recognition where you are creating a pattern from the concrete data.\n\n**Fi** is introverted **F**eeling, **Fe** is extroverted **F**eeling.\n\n* **Te** is extroverted **T**hinking, **Ti** is introverted **T**hinking\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n^(So now you know the 8 abbreviations that correspond to the 8 most important concepts in MBTI / Socionics / Jungian Cognitive Functions that make up Jungian Personality Temperament theory.  *BUT WHAT THE HELL* are the 8 important concepts supposed to mean?)\n\n**Points to the sidebar** on /r/ENFP \n\n>**Description**\n\n>ENFP (Ne-Fi-Te-Si) is a personality type within Jungian Cognitive Function theory, \n\n> * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_cognitive_functions\n\n>which categorizes people according to their intrinsic differences in cognitive attitudes. ENFPs are often positively nicknamed the "inspirers".\n\nI don't personally like the wikipedia sidebar on /r/ENFP as the first link you should go view.  It is a great link but you should start with other "texts" first.  I prefer these 4 links.  I have these links in a specific order.\n\n* http://www.cognitiveprocesses.com/Cognitive-Functions/ This terminology is literally written by Linda Berens one of the big wigs of MBTI that has her own, type 8 models of MBTI.\n\n * Notice in the big link there are 8 small links to get a more thorough description of the 8 functions.\n\n* Similar but different https://www.careerplanner.com/8CognitiveFunctions/Cognitive-Functions-Simply-Explained.cfm This termiology is using the John Beebe terminology which is compatible but slightly different than Linda Berens. Article written by Michael T. Robinson.\n\n* https://personalityhacker.com/nicknames-for-8-jungian-cognitive-functions/ (A more simple explanation, but I started with the complicated first before pivoting to the more applied for a reason.)  Personality Hacker focuses on the applied side of MBTI, let me quote A major part of our mission at Personality Hacker is to make powerful concepts accessible and simple. Not because people aren‚Äôt intelligent, but because people are busy and many things vie for our attention.\n\n* https://i0.wp.com/www.psychologyjunkie.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/INFJ-Functions-with-Shadow.jpg?w=841&ssl=1 Note this 4th link is just an image. (It is the most simple, most applied of the 4 links I just gave you.)  All humans ask the same 8 questions but in a different order for each question either gives you more information of something or helps you organize the information in a practical / praxis way.  The order in that image is an INFJ.  The order for an ENFP is read the right column first, and the left column is backup / subdued when the right column can't do the main thing.\n\nIf you want to read the wikipedia read it after those 4 links.  I am sorry if I gave you more homework.  Probably too much homework for one siting, but the first link is a great starting point üòä
4	i - INTROVERTED\n\ne- EXTROVERTED\n\nT- thinking\n\nF- feeling\n\nN- intuition\n\nS- sensing\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe abbreviated terms are referring to the cognitive functions, which are processes we all use in a certain order that make up our overall way of percieving reality and making judgments. \n\nAs an ENFP, your functional stack, or the order in which your cognitive functions falls, is :\n\nNe (extroverted intuition) - concerned with percieving and exploring new possibilities. Its an indirect relationship with the external enviornment. Not what is, but what COULD be, by recognizing patterns, connecting dots and building webs or potential inevitibilities based on what is being percieved. Because this is the ENFP'S primary function, this can manifest as being predominantly motivated by an underlying sense of restlessness that is combated by being occupied with new ideas, people or scenarios that may or may not have any relevance to your present reality. \n\nFi (introverted feeling) - concerned with getting in touch with a person's needs and feelings/ desires and the nature of it. Fi is an internal function that focuses on the individual's emotional experience, the implications of such experiences and understanding the nature of it before projecting what is learned as a universal rule of thumb. Because introverted feeling is the 2nd function of an ENFP, this can manifests as bouncing from person to person and attempting to connect emotionally in order to learn something new about the nature of the human condition. It can also lead to an ENFP having many "friends" but feeling somewhat alone.\n\nTe (extroverted thinking) - productivity and understanding/ organizing the external enviornment in a consistent manner. It seeks to refine and improve.  Because this is the third function of an ENFP, it is not a process they are generally experts in utilizing. This can manifest in moments of stress for an ENFP and lead to a tendency to become controlling and  at times exploitative of others. On the upside it can manifest as an ENFP potentially bringing their ideas to fruition. An enfp is more likely than another type (for example infp) to make their vision a reality, as Te is not stimulated soley by the IDEA of a desired outcome but the ACTUALIZATION of the desired outcome. Not to say that INFP don't get shit done. It's just easier for ENFPS. Generally.\n\nSi (introverted sensing)- concerned with recalling and storing details and past information. An indirect relationship with external enviornment. Not so much what is but the IMPRESSION of what is and all associated information that is relevant. Because Si is the inferior function of an ENFP, it can manifest as a lack of grounding or flightiness. Enfp's can generally struggle to find value in traditional roles or ways of living (ex, 9-5 jobs). Si provides meticulousness and attention to details as well as a sense of grounding which ENFP's can initially lack.\n\nThere are 8 total cognitive function and they all interact and serve one another, This created a dynamic interplay of processes that influence the tendencies of an individual person. It is NOT the personality per say, as it is just parts of a machine. \n\nWhen you consider all the functions of an ENFP, you can resume this as a type that has their self actualization on display and wishes to lead by example. \n\nThere is waayy more to this then what I've presented and it could be tainted with my own bias and perception, so I recommend you do further research into this topic, It's super fascinating! Hope this breif summary helped. 
3	Those are cognitive functions, I suggest reading about them. Every type has four main functions (some connect it with socionics and acknowledge shadow functions etc)\nENFPs cog function stack is Ne Fi Te Si 
1	For the same reaosn everyone use abreviations, it's faster to write/say.\n\nWriting "Extraverted Thinking" or Te is an easy choice. If you don't know what Te is, research the cognitive function. Personally, I recommand sociotype.com (from socionics) 
1	Here's a really good starting off point:\n\nhttps://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/if-youre-confused-about-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-read-this-an-intro-to-cognitive-functions/\n\nThen this: https://www.typeinmind.com/nefi/
204	Does anyone else here ‚Äútouch‚Äù on many different groups but not fully join them like bounce around and end up being surface level friends with a lot of people, but deep with only a few	
61	Ne craves ***new*** interactions\n\nFi craves ***deep*** interactions\n\nThe tension between the two can cause different outcomes in many ways, the way you describe is how many (but not all) ENFPs are.  You get\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBABNSLKyJw
30	Yup. I am currently on a break from meeting new people, even though I crave it, since I really don‚Äôt have enough time to catch up with existing friends. It‚Äôs funny, one of my INTJ friends recently got upset that after a long time of hanging out together, we suddenly stopped meeting as much, with me being busy all the time. And she told me this:\n\n‚ÄòFor you, your friends are all equal, of the same importance to you, they‚Äôre all in a long line, and you have a lot of them. Sometimes, you get some out of the line and you spend time with them for a while, and then you get bored or something, and you put these friends back in the line, and get other few friends to hang around with for the next period of time, and so on and so forth.‚Äô\n\nVisualizing this made me realize I actually am like that. But it‚Äôs not only cause I get bored, it‚Äôs also cause I realize I was neglecting other people for too long. What can I say, we are what we are and it‚Äôs in no way harmful on purpose.\n\n\n\n
22	Oh my god...story of my entire life! It makes it hard to keep up with everyone you want to or that you find interesting.  Maybe not surface level, but definitely not enough time for everyone I want in my life.  That‚Äôs the social butterfly effect right?
15	Me to a T. It‚Äôs actually interfering with my ability to feel like I‚Äôm actually loved. I struggle because I feel like everyone is replaceable and so am I. 
9	This is exactly what happens to me. I have many many friends but only a few ‚Äúreal ones‚Äù that are like brothers to me. When I‚Äôm feeling down and the real ones are not around I sometimes feel like I have so many friends that I have none and I end up feeling lonely.
6	Yes. My introvert friends said I have a lot of friends or maybe what they meant is I have a lot of circles. But at first I didn't rlly think so bc I dont have many deep friends. But now that I think of it, I have many surface level friends more than any average people do. Lol. Im loving it though. 
5	It me
4	I take a lot of personal satisfaction from maintaining a lot of relationships‚Äîany of which could become deeper if given the right chance.\n\nI literally have friends all over the country and on multiple continents that I keep up with. It‚Äôs to the point where I pinged my Facebook circle that I would be in Phoenix, AZ and two different couples offered to put me up for the night. I genuinely enjoyed reconnecting with all of those folks and it would likely be a similar case in most places I would visit at this point.\n\nI completely recognize that this sounds like bragging. So for caveats, no I don‚Äôt know a lot of these people very well and it‚Äôs entirely possible that I overestimate their willingness to engage with me. But I absolutely love making friends and I‚Äôve worked hard to be good at it. I try to be genuinely grateful for everyone I meet, and to show them the most honest and loving side of myself that I can.\n\nThe few close friends that I have...idk how to even describe the way they make me feel. I didn‚Äôt think I would ever be close to people like these friends. I didn‚Äôt think it was possible, and I still marvel at the fact that I‚Äôm somehow a person that they want to be around.
3	Yeah i do that
3	This was me in college.  I‚Äôm still somewhat like that, but I‚Äôm too busy these days to dwell on my lack of deep friendships.  
2	Story of my life. I think it‚Äôs a more subtle form of Ne-Te loop. I try to address it this way: It takes a bit of practice but the moment I find something interest (aka all the time) I stop and think to myself ‚Äúwhat am I giving up if I use time and energy in this way? Do I really want to do it then?‚Äù\n\nIf the answer is yes then yay! Adventures! But if the answer is no, it‚Äôs much easier to not be stuck in FOMO if I took some seconds to remind myself of what I would actually miss out on.
1	Definitely. During my high school years, I found myself trying to meet new people by joining clubs. First club I joined was my high school instrumental band. I met a couple of people and hit it off with one in particular. Sadly, I never really became good friends with any of them and the one great friendship I had with this one girl just vanished over summer. Next year I then joined my school cross country/track team after transferring from my previous school (long story üòÇ). But yeah in there, I actually formed more deep bonds with people on the team and I still keep in contact with a couple of them despite being in college. In college however, I broke put of my shell and talked to many people. Lol I know a lot of people. But I only really have a few friends which I consider as "close friends". Long story short, yeah ENFPs tend to do this for the most part.
1	Argh yes... This just hit me yesterday... I don‚Äôt really know how many people really consider me their friend, aside from like 2 or 3, the rest may look at me as someone who‚Äôs just there... interesting and amusing, sure,  but comes and goes at random... I wish I could change people‚Äôs perceptions of this behaviour, but I wouldn‚Äôt change my life rn. I‚Äôm happy with all the friends I have and how hard I worked to be able to meet all these wonderful new people. I‚Äôm sorry sometimes I can‚Äôt spend as much time as they want me with them but it‚Äôs really not personal. The people who understand that, I‚Äôm happy to keep calling them my friends. The rest can go. 
1	Yes, yes, yes.   \nAnd once I leave that group/circle of friends/acquaintances, most of those friendships fade, too.
1	Absolutely. Doesn‚Äôt even have to be groups. I do it with games, books, tv shows, everything 
1	I have a lot of friends, but I take time to really focus on a few. My idea is to go deep, instead of wide. What I have noticed though is that if the friends I'm making aren't as interesting I won't want to go deep with them, so that could be why you're jumping around. Another thing worth noting is that lately I've cared less about objects/things and more about people, so I've avoided groups that meet for the purpose of doing somethings in regards to their objects they are into, if that makes sense. So I try to avoid groups that meet to play video games, or meet to work out, or meet to watch anime/Netflix or anything else that's fandom based. I meet people now based on our interest in having an experience with each other. In hindsight I probably sound pretty pretentious right about now. Sorry!
1	MOOD. For a while I would cry whenever anything would mention a ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù like the kind that‚Äôs there for you and you randomly go to each others houses and stuff. I still don‚Äôt really have anyone like that but my friends and I do hang out more often
1	Been there my whole life. Bunch of okay friends but no best friend. No one thinks of you as a best friend. I‚Äôm always the second choice. Not even when I tried really hard to actually join their group, you just hang around the edge. It‚Äôs like a taking group photo with your friends but you always end up being the photographer. I‚Äôm never in the picture. \n\nGood thing I found better friends and my soulmate in college. I told my new friends about this and it‚Äôs really comforting to hear that they think I‚Äôm the one who ties the group together.\n\nAdvice from my new friends that actually cares about me: don‚Äôt put your heart and soul into people who doesn‚Äôt give you a single fuck. It‚Äôs better to cut out those people in your life. Not worth it. 
1	I've got two totally different groups of friends, and I'm definitely deeply connected to them. They are all my brothers and sisters. \n\nOne group is into drugs and drinking and art and music and nature. The other is into board games and video games and church and they don't drink or do anything that could be morally questionable.\n\nBoth groups represent aspects of my personality and my interests. Both are people I love with all of my heart. And both are there for me when I need them(and vice versa).

15	What are the Self-help books you found more useful and resonating?	Let‚Äôs compile a list of books that might be useful for us ENFPs!\n\nI start:\n\n- ‚ÄúSo good they can‚Äôt ignore you‚Äù by Cal Newport\n\nThis one is useful for us because we tend to crave meaningful work, and he gives a rational recipe to obtain it in the modern world. Newport is definitely not an ENFP and his book was not written with our type specifically in mind so it comes off as a bit preachy and paternalistic, but I think his analysis is so rational and so well backed up by facts that it ends up being convincing also for NF types.\n\n- ‚ÄúThe power of habit‚Äù by Charles Duhigg\n\nFor us who loathe structures and constraints, I think this one is a tough but needed reading. I found it helpful, it‚Äôs definitely easier to achieve my dreams if I structure my day around them and not just rely on willpower (a *very* limited resource in my case).\n\n- ‚ÄúDeep Work‚Äù again by Cal Newport\n\nI swear I‚Äôm not being paid to sponsor him ahah but this is the one I‚Äôm reading now and it‚Äôs a cold shower, but one that every ENFP needs in my opinion. He illustrates the benefits both professional and personal of ‚Äúgoing deep‚Äù, aka taking the time to focus on specific topics with all of your attention for several hours a time, several times a day and per week. I think us Ne doms find this anxiety inducing at first, because it illustrates how something contrary to our nature is actually very rewarded in the world. But I think us ENFPs really need this beautiful ode to depth, it‚Äôs pushing me to get out of my comfort zone in a way that makes me grow a lot.\n\n- ‚ÄúHow I stayed alive when my brain was trying to kill me‚Äù by Susan Rose Blauner\n\nAdorable, wholesome, kind, understanding but yet functional and useful. For those pesky Si overtake moments.\n\nWhat are your favorite ones?

1	How to appeal to the ENFP‚Äôs Fi?	Hello, INFJ here. I‚Äôm curious about Fi in ENFPs, so I figured I may as well just go straight to the source. \n\nI‚Äôve been dating an ENFP for a few months now, and I‚Äôm having a really hard time expressing my feelings. With Fe in an INFJ, it‚Äôs important that we discuss what we are feeling to interpret it again as data and finally process it. I know that Fi users can pretty much sort things on their own, and don‚Äôt always feel the need to talk about things. However, I have things I need to vent to him but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll feel like he won‚Äôt understand, as his Fi can come across as more Ti, and he tends to approach situations this way. What I need to talk about has nothing to do with our relationship, it‚Äôs about my toxic family and insecurities and such. \n\nHe has mentioned before that he doesn‚Äôt like to feel suffocated in relationships, will talking about these deeper feelings suffocate him?\n\nWhat should I do to communicate to him \neffectively whilst likely being a blubbering mess? \n\nHow do I show him he‚Äôs important to me?\n\nAny input is welcome. Thank you so much for your time
7	Hm. If this guy is truly and ENFP then you shouldn't have issues. Either way you shouldn't have to worry about expressing yourself to your SO. Are you sure he uses Fi? There is a general interest in the emotional affairs of others with this function so it's a little strange that you would feel he wouldn't be open to listening. When you say he approached this more like Ti, do you mean to say that he digests your feelings in a very technical way? He could be defaulting to Te. Does your boyfriend by chance respond by offering pragmatic ways to resolve the situations that elicit your emotionality?\n\nYou could start off by explaining that you want emotional support, and not solutions ATM. Just someone you could vent to. You've been feeling a lot of weight on you emotionally and feel that expressing hwo you're feeling will help you heal and move forward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour feelings have reasons behind them but ultimately the feelings are somewhat their own thing and the only action you can take with your feelings is simply to FEEL them and let em go. 
6	You are overthinking, this but that is our nature (hello fellow IN_J from an INTJ üòä) but it is also natural to be overthinking / hypervigilant regardless of type when you had a shitty childhood (I did as well.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo lets talk this out since you are already in overthinking mode =)  Lets do this fellow IN_J\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>I‚Äôve been dating an ENFP for a few months now, and I‚Äôm having a really hard time expressing my feelings.

What I need to talk about has nothing to do with our relationship, it‚Äôs about my toxic family and insecurities and such.\n\nHun we need to talk about Arm Functions (your 2nd and 3rd function for all types, regardless of ENFP or INFJ) but we need to talk about your other Arm Function, your tetriary function (Ti for INFJ and Te for an ENFP) not your auxiliary function (Fe for INFJ and Fi for ENFP)\n\n* An ISFJ and INFJ's need ***to be understood*** is due to Ti not Fe.  It is due to your tertiary function, your tetriary always has the same introvert / extrovert energy as your dominant function but you are weaker at your tetriary function compared to your auxillary function.\n\n* An ENFPs and ESFPs need is **to know things*** which is due to Te not Fi.  This is very similar to the Ti in ISFJs and INFJs but how this "thinking" manifests is very different due to different introversion and extroversion energies.  Te is more practical due to its extroverted nature of the thinking, while Ti is more abstract and anayltical.  Ti wants to analyze the experience, while Te wants to know what to do with the experience, how to organize the experience as Linda Berens describes it.  Ti wants to know "why it is" while Te wants to know for knowing allows one to "how to do it."\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd from this tetriary function with the same introvert / extrovert energy as your dominant / leading / hero function you then pivot to the 2nd function you are much stronger with.  This 2nd function will provide cathartic relief.\n\nENFPs with their Fi want to love / want freedom to love, and INFJs with their Fe want to **be** love**d.** Now it is not a single binary separation for ENFPs also want to be loved as well they just want the freedom to love a little more and INFJs want the freedom to love / be in an environment which allows them to authentically love but they also want to be loved / treasured just a little more.\n\nBut the freedom to love requires **knowledge**, it requires the ability to organize this active feeling of the kineticity of love. \n\nJust like the ability to be loved, requires **understanding** to know what something authentically is and to love it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>He has mentioned before that he doesn‚Äôt like to feel suffocated in relationships, will talking about these deeper feelings suffocate him?\n\nQuite the opposite.\n\nTelling your ENFP your history but not **requiring** him to understand how powerful your history is to you, but to let him know your history and him to gain knowledge from it, this will create a bond with your ENFP.  It is pure Fi stuff but the Fi stuff needs a Te foundation.  The ENFP will understand that these secret events happened in your past and he will understand 80% of it and will try to understand 98% of it, but the ENFP is comfortable he will never understand 100 or 104% of it.  He will love you anyway even though he will have Zeno's Paradox (click the link for the image) \n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes\n\nwhere 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%, 99.999% will never equal 1 exactly but the ENFP is smart enough to understand the concept of limit, the concept of calculus even if he is great at math or horrible at math he will innituiately get it due to the magic of Fi and Te.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>What should I do to communicate to him effectively whilst likely being a blubbering mess?\n\nENFPs love blubbering messes, for one can be a blubbering mess and still be awesome and that is the nature of Fi.\n\nThink about this for a second, a person that is happy or sad is made of the same atoms, the only difference is how those atoms "dance."  A dead person and a person is alive is made up of the same atoms, the only difference is how the atoms "dance."  A person asleep lost in dream world or a person that is awake taking in new information via the senses is the same atoms the only difference is how the atoms "dance."\n\nAn ENFP wants to know what moves your world, ***what moves the thing-onto-yourself that is you.*** What animated you?  That is what an ENFP wants to know with his Fi.  And an ENFP will always have imperfect knowledge of you due to how our inner worlds can't be shared directly via language, but an ENFP will be able to pick up the important parts of your inner world via their applied experience of one's Te, the tertiary function for an ENFP.
2	Do you want to bring your unhappiness to the relationship? Are you two ready to handle personal feelings with each other? \n\nWhen you're in a relationship with someone. It will give rise, an opportunity for your deeper personal feelings to rise to surface. These feelings will make you angry, resentful, sad, grossed, averted from each other. Anything but love. See love is not one of these feelings, but is the natural state you are in, when these feelings pass. Feelings pass. Don't hold onto them, so they will pass effortlessly as possible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is extremely important that you both be honest, and loving with one another. Because if one of you is not strong enough. The feelings you or he will bring, will overcome you. And your relationship will suffer.\n\nIt's important for you to know, right now, that you can go through these feelings and pain. And that even though you are going through that. You need to know that he loves you. That he will be there, for you. Don't expect anything out of him, but to be there. nonjudgmental, unwavering. As a man, not a boy. Boys feel suffocated, men will not find themselves in such situations, and if they do, they will deal with it as accordingly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBe yourself, this is an important time for you to learn more about who he truly is. And what you need. Beyond blind love.
1	If he truly cares about you, and he's a typical enfp, and you being an infj it should all just flow very naturally. Sounds like you're being a bit hard on yourself, even if you do cry and become blubbery if he cares it'll be okay, it happens. Showing someone you trust them is showing them they're important to you too. Trust your gut.
1	Just communicate. All of this you've told us, tell him. The insecurities, the questions. Let him know how you feel and ask what he wants.
3	Badgers?	This is probably an obvious question and has probably been asked before (I'm sorry if it's been asked a lot)  but we're Hufflepuffs, aren't we? 
7	I‚Äôm a gryffindor 
4	Ravenclaw for me!\n\nWit, curiosity and creativity are up my alley. I think I‚Äôd be one of the eccentric Ravenclaws who follows my artistic pursuits but also wants to learn all about Herbology and Care of Magical Creatures
4	Lol ya we share a degree of personality traits but we are all uniquely different people with experiences that shape us so no we are not all hufflepuffs thank you. üòÅ
4	I've heard that many ENFPs actually belong in Slytherin?
3	I get Griffindor everytime (stupid spelling), but I honestly love hufflepuffs with all my being and want to see them grow to be strong and healthy #hufflepuffprotectionsquad
2	I see ENFP's as Gryffindors. The best, brave, cool, awesome, usually popular, champions, lions, gold.
7	Being human?	Thoughts and emotions continually swirl through my mind. Each thought evokes a myriad of emotions, pulling my heart and mind in polar directions. I am paralyzed. I take a moment and attempt to observe myself objectively, and chuckle at my existence. Being human is strange, stressful, potentially rewarding, messy, and just fucking strange. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nExcited/nervous to see where life takes me and to see who I become.
1	Nice
8	Playing Skyrim as an ENFP	 If you‚Äôre familiar with the game Skyrim ,(and being as you‚Äôre on reddit, probably are), and are an ENFP ( this being the the subreddit, you probably are) you might have had a similar playthrough in this game as I. ( or any open world game tbh) \n\nAs you make your way out of the first cave, your mouth gapes in awe at the vast beauty that stands before you. Mountains to hike, treasure to find, adventures to have ! Knowing that it‚Äôs probably important , you should follow the man that helped you escape to the next town over. But WAIT?! What is this path that leads away to  the forest unknown? It looks so pretty, and there are butterflies! so Obviously this man is just dragging you along a boring path in a dialogue filled shipwreck..  You‚Äôll get back to it later.\n\n* And the main quest was never finished *\n\nThen,\nproceed to talk to every npc about their life, with the  wide variety of options they have to offer in their discussion  /S . Always claiming to help them , in their moment of downfall , never to fully\ncomplete the quest. However, it is nice just listen to them, offer advice if possible.\n\nProceed to make about 20 more new games, each branching out in different directions , yet never to be fully completed .\n\n

3	Possessiveness of partner	I want to have a boyfriend, but the thought of me being possessive of my bf like I did on my ex is terrifying me. So does any of you have the same problem and how do you tackle it? 
3	We're commited people, that's just the way it is. Something you can do is try to empathise with your partner as much as possible and really put yourself in their shoes reflecting on your own behaviour. But if your partner cannot accept that you're committed and trying your best, they're just not right for you. \nMoreover, being scared about dating isn't going to help. The whole point of dating is trying to find a partner in a fun way, no stress.\nI believe in you!
9	Always Thinking How Things Can Be Better/Improved	I find I often think how things could better or more efficient, faster, cheaper, whatever it is. I guess it is Ne seeing possibilities mixed with Te looking for efficiency and  the best way. I always am looking for or seeing ways things could be improved whether it is technology/inventions, businesses, products, movies, TV shows, books, apps, websites, etc.\n\nI find things are often inefficient and the reason is either it's cheaper (though this is false as it would be cheaper in the long run if they actually invested a little to make it better now) or the main reason is it just is. That is, it has always been that way. Things were originally designed or created in a certain way but they still use it now despite improvements in technology, etc. I hate tradition like that.\n\nAnyone else always seeing how things could be improved?

3	It's Too Excited Tuesday!	\nCAN I GET A HELL YEAH?! It's Too Excited Tuesday! Unleash the happy!\n\nWhat makes you excited? :D\n
2	I met an INFJ, it's funny how we just instantly hit it off and have never ending conversations. \nI HAVE AN INFJ YOU GUYS 
2	Not feeling particularly excited today. Worn out and sad. My cousin passed away from breast cancer a month ago and I'm seriously missing her and stuck thinking about death and losing people today.
1	Reading Sapiens by Yval Noah Harari. Always makes me feel creative
1	EVERYTHING!
1	Thank you! 
5	Serious People and Not Serious People	I've noticed some people take themselves very seriously and are serious all the time while others don't take themselves seriously and are fun, silly all the time. I'm not sure if it's a Myers Briggs thing or not.\n\nOne place that it is easy to see this is with actors. It's not about whether they do comedies or drama but the way they are in real life and interviews, etc. For example Jonah Hill plays in mostly comedies but in real life he seems very serious and takes himself too seriously. But Seth Rogen seems like he is silly/fun in real life too. And there are drama actors, award winners who I think are actually light and non-serious in real life like Eddie Redmayne.\n\nPersonally I am a non-serious person. I take myself and life non-seriously. I like to be silly and funny and  fun and play. I use puns and word-play and dad jokes. I think some people take themselves too seriously.\n\nHave you noticed the dichotomy of serious and not serious people? In their real, relaxed state, not when acting (and I don't just mean actors as I think everyone puts on a mask in different settings).
1	I found an article from the author of the survival guide for ENFP‚Äôs and she claims many tests inaccurately identify ESFP‚Äôs as ENFP‚Äôs.\n\nFrom her article:  ‚ÄòWhereas the ESFP often feels as though they‚Äôre suffocating if they are away from people for too long, the ENFP feels as though they‚Äôre suffocating if they‚Äôre around people for too long, as their dominant extroverted intuition function thrives on idea generation, not direct interaction with their external environment.\n\nESFPs also tend to be more emotionally expressive than the ENFP type, as their emotions are primarily based on what‚Äôs going on in their lives. The ESFP often shares their struggles and dramas freely with others, wanting input as to what others think of the situation (hearing other‚Äôs opinions also helps them to see the situation from other angles and come to a more informed conclusion as to what they should do about it).\n\nENFPs, on the other hand, tend to search for the root cause or underlying reason behind their emotions. Rather than sharing the concrete details of the situation at hand with others, the ENFP is more likely to seek out psychological models that help them to understand why themselves and others are acting and reacting in certain ways. Though they do feel things incredibly deeply, the ENFP takes on a more clinical approach to their feelings than the ESFP, who focuses predominantly on resolving the situation at hand in as direct a fashion as possible.\n\nHowever, ENFPs are often misrepresented as a type that is expressive and dramatic about their feelings, since many ESFPs mistakenly refer to themselves as ENFPs.‚Äô\n\nAs an ENFP I can be whatever a group needs me to be, but no matter what I need a huge long breath afterward and like 2 days to recenter myself and process.
27	Do you ever hide your intelligence from people?	ENFP guy here. I am always afraid of appearing as one of those people that flex on others with their intelligence (eek it just makes me cringe thinking about being like that) so I purposely try to appear as average as I can. Yet, combined with my ENFP antics, most people just assume I am dumb. This hurts because  I want to be authentic with myself, yet I also value being humble and modest around people. It's like two of my values conflict with each other.\n\nSometimes when people mock me for being dumb I just want to pull out my Te and read them for filth.
30	I read the room, I adapt to who I'm talking to. This pretentious well dressed guy? I'll be a pretentious well dressed guy. My friends who like hockey, drinking beer and eating nachos, I'll be their friend who drinks beer and eat nachos, not bore them with my so called intelligence. It's a balance and I like to play with it. I show what I want to show.
6	Yeah, i feel you. I hate seeming arrogant but I also don't like seeming dull. Hitting a good middle point where you are competent and interesting is about saying enough to get your point across, and leaving enough close to the chest so anyone interested in more can ask if *they* want to. Oversharing is generally what happens when someone appears to be flexing their intelligence. Is my two cents. Few people intend to sound smarter than everyone. \n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that appearing "average" is not a good thing. Who that "average" is is going to depend on who you are surrounding yourself with. If you try to sound average around a group of people who are below average, then when you interact with people who are above average you're going to miss the mark. Same goes the other way. I know its cliche, but just "be yourself". If you're smart, cool. Everyone needs smart friends, be the smart friend. But as said before, don't overshare. 
3	Nods I think this is a common thing for ENFPs. ^(I am not an ENFP)\n\nI think this is common thing for ENFPs because of function order reasons.  Has to do with two things.\n\n* Ne vs Se, where the Se is Subdued / Shadow yet you ENFPs are so strong at Ne.  You naturally pick out patterns, even complex patterns very quickly.  Yet the rest of your body / brain is playing catch up so while you have the general form down pat, the actual sequencing of the complex data you are playing catch up.\n\n* The specific order of the 4 Judgement Functions with Fi, Te, Fe and Ti in the specfic function order locations.  This 2nd part I can't really explain easily the theory and lets not talk theory, lets instead have you read a socionics^(variant MBTI) description of the ENFP\n\nFocus in on the description of your Se for ENFPs but hyperfocus on the interactions of the 4 Judgement Functions (Fi, Te, Fe, and Ti)\n\nhttp://www.sociotype.com/socionics/types/IEE-ENFp/\n\nThese issues you brought up in this post /u/jillerski are brought up in that description of an ENFP that I linked to above.  So many intelligence tasks are so easy for an ENFP, other intelligence tasks are not hard but they are "complicated" and thus the ENFP wants to keep their thinking private until they are challenged, or until you are confident you can implement the idea into practice, you can make it physical, you can be effective and efficent.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Sometimes when people mock me for being dumb\n\nThis is a different subject, but ENFPs loathe mocking in all its forms.  They almost 100% always see it as the not best way of doing something and almost always is harmful / negative in some way.  Mocking is a triggering thing for an ENFP in almost all its forms in almost all its relationships / context we can use the word mocking the ENFP will be sour at.
3	Yep.  Doesn't help that I was a very arrogant kid and other kids didn't like me much.  Got better when I was a teenager.\n\nNow I tend to play the bubbly archetype a little too much that it's probably hurting me more than it's helping.
3	i feel you. i‚Äôve had friends been passive aggressive/mortified when they realised i‚Äôm not just happy-go-lucky/stupid all the time. i actually enjoy pursuing knowledge and academic excellence but my enfp personality hides all of that. it‚Äôs something i‚Äôve come to accept and i try to look at it in a positive light. it‚Äôs always nice to prove someone wrong and give them a little surprise :)
3	Only in menial jobs where I act like an idiot so I can be lazy because my employers don't expect me to be any better than I'm being.
2	I do the opposite, I‚Äôm narcissistic to a certain degree when I have no one else to rely on(which happens quite a lot) in order to push myself 
2	Just hide your arrogance, not your intelligence
2	Yes and no. I don't hide my intelligence, but I also have learned to hold my tongue a great deal more. I used to like showing off, but found it only alienated me. And I like companionship a great deal more than feeling superior. So I'm cautious about how I let it out.
2	Yeah. I don‚Äôt wanna end up on r/iamverysmart or anything 
2	I don't try to hide my intelligence but don't force it on people either. It just comes out.
2	I try hard to humble myself before everyone, even my kids, but more often than not it's looked upon as weakness to others.  It especially attracts individuals with power issues, leads to conflict.\n\nI'm not afraid however, to speak my mind.  Just make absolutely, 100% sure when you do you're infallible.  Run over it a few times in your head if you have too.
6	ENFP v ESFP interaction	
2	Well done! =0) I always wonder how people always play into our button pushing ways. Like, every. Single. Time. LOL. 
1	Hey guys, made this vid with my brother and thought it ended up being a good interaction video b/n ENFP and ESFP. Guess who? :)
133	People keep thinking I have a crush on them	I'm pretty sure this is an ENFP problem! I'm super friendly and enthusiastic, and apparently this makes people think I'm interested in them. This is far from the first time it's happened, but just now my roommate told me that she thought I had a crush on her! I wish I could be my normal affectionate self without worrying about it.
61	You can solve this by actually having a crush on everyone and therefore validating their theories
66	We are in love with the world...\n\nBut yeah, its hard not to lead people on. Sort of wish people were more affectionate just so we wouldn't sand out so much. \n\nEdit: or Maybe its just hopeful thinking on their part that we are crushing on them because we are so sexy. 
33	This thread is hilarious.  Yes to this whole thing.  When I worked at Starbucks, my co-workers multiple times accused me of flirting with all the customers.  It legit made me feel bad because in my mind I was just really interested in talking to the customers and wanted to know about them as people and hopefully be a bright spot in their day.  Like I just genuinely like people, and if I could find a job to spread sunshine and flowers and happiness and sprinkle it on people‚Äôs heads, I would.  Apparently not everyone in the world thinks that way.   \n\n\nAlso my enthusiasm in sharing things of interest with people has made them think I was doing it because I had a crush on them.  For example - one of my science teachers  who was my absolute fave (quite frankly I did have a gigantic crush on him because he was so smart and in a circus too) was quite cheeky later on and insinuated that he knew I had had a crush on him the year before.  Although he was right (I don‚Äôt think I hide it very well), I think he took my constantly being in his office asking him random science questions, my constant emails asking questions about mysterious things of the universe, sharing scientific articles and books with him, cracking nerdy math jokes, and requesting to do extra experiments outside of class as excuses to be around him.  Looking back on it, it‚Äôs probably not typical to see that kind of enthusiasm from a 30-something woman.  After I left his class, I continued to talk to him hoping things would continue as before, but he stopped talking to me about sciencey things and started talking about ‚Äúnormal‚Äù ‚Äúnon-school‚Äù things and asked me out.  That relationship ended, but sometimes I wonder if he did not understand that that WAS the normal me.\n\n\nAnyhow - I don‚Äôt think most people are used to all that natural childlike enthusiasm.  I remember one time being at dinner with some acquaintances and looking up at the moon and saying how pretty it looked, and they looked at me and laughed and were like, ‚Äúyeah....it‚Äôs the moon‚Äù as if I were being silly to wonder at it.\n\n\nAnyhow....I imagine we make people secretly in love with us from our joy of life and they wish we did like them.
13	Happens to me like atleast twice a month.\n\nAfter the second or third conversation they start giving me the flirty looks and im like: "ahhh dangit"
5	hey it's cute to be a ENFP though. i am a INTJ and i can't imagine being as energetic as you. We're so lazy
6	Yeah, though, maybe that is what other types think flirting is? Or maybe its how some types flirt but its how others interact with the world. So people confuse someone being nice and friendly for someone showing interest beyond that. Though clearly from their perspective it can be downright impossible to tell the difference, especially if they are not used to people being friendly just because they are friendly. 
5	As an INFJ, I like how friendly you guys are  (even to a cautious turtle like me), I just wish you guys would maybe refrain from really flirty banter that makes me think you're into me. \nFor example, an ENFP I once knew told me: "you spark my imagination so much, you're a special girl", discussed travelling together, what romantic/sexual things I liked. \nTurns out he wasn't into me; he ghosted. \n\nI just wish ENFPs would refrain from sexually flirty banter, because chances are I will fall for you, lol. Or just be honest anyway. \n\nThat being said, I love how you guys brighten everything wherever you go and come up with crazy stories and ideas. 
19	Hol' up though. We flirt. We know we're flirting when we flirt. We adults. Let's not write this off as "I'm just being an ENFP hehe." Come on now. 
5	This happens to me a lot as well. It frustrated me growing up because I felt like I had to change how I was in order to not make people feel I uncomfortable. But now I kind of just go with flow. You just have to find a comfortable balance between identifying and respecting people's boundaries and being yourself. 
4	Yeppp. Relevant example:  https://imgur.com/gallery/P5sDdIU\n\nI've never had to argue with someone about not flirting before
3	I have that problem too 
3	I‚Äôm so glad it‚Äôs not just me. Most of my female friends are married so I‚Äôm pretty comfortable just being me and joking with them or whatever, because I treat their husbands the exact same way so they know that it‚Äôs just me. \n\nBut on a handful of occasions the last couple years I‚Äôve had female friends or acquaintances who completely misread me and then I‚Äôm the bad guy for leading them on*. Most recently, a friend was upset with me because I wouldn‚Äôt treat her the way I treat my married friends. Well, no, because I know for a fact you want to date me, and if I just treated you normally it would be bad for everybody and you would get your feelings real hurt. \n\n*at one point I absolutely was the bad guy and that was a rough time. But that was one situation out of several and I think my general point still stands.
3	Same but that‚Äôs because I easily find things I like about everyone. I also flirt uncontrollably all the time 
3	I stopped thinking about people thinking I have a crush on them as a problem with me when I realized it was more a reflection on how rare genuine interest in another person is when everyone thinks I have a crush on them when I‚Äôm  just trying to get to know them üòÇ
3	Yes you ENFP's are fucked up. You will fall in love and have sex with anyone then to find out you don't feel anything anymore.\nYoure flirtatious as hell. Even dogs and cats are not safe. \nStrange how we love people more then we love ourselves.\nStop being so damn sexy now!\n\nCheers,\n\nENFP dude
2	it happened to me too. a lot.
1	This has happened to me so many times that for a good 5+ years I was convinced I didn't know what flirting actually was and would occasionally overcompensate by being obnoxious or mean. It was not a fun time, for anyone. 
1	I'm an INFP and it happens to me as well. But now that I'm older, I'm very aware of this and am very careful not to lead people on because I'd never want to hurt anybody. Setting boundaries and sticking to them is important! It also means having uncomfortable conversations with people sometimes because I don't want them to suffer because of me. I think it's very important to talk. I know it often feels like it's their problem and you have better things to do. But if you've ever been on the other side, you know how much it can hurt and how much time you can waste on wondering if somebody likes you etc. 
1	Happens so often, I find myself having to pull out words like mate, friend, buddy or casually mentioning some girl that I‚Äôve been talking to, to void any suspicions.... 
1	Yeah, happens when you give too much eye contact üò©
0	Ugh yeah. All the fucking time.
1	I've seen some of your names appear with your type in blue, how do I do that?	
2	I have the same question! 
2	There is a pinned post at the top that tells you how to set your flair.
21	Unemployment as an ENFP, general anxiety, and a sense of doom.	I'm an ENFP in their early twenties. I've changed my career path so many times, and currently live with my parents and have been needing to rely on someone so far the entirety of my adult life. I've had several "jobs." I do freelance character illustration. I write. I administrate groups. But most of that doesn't make anything but pocket change. I've worked in a ton of minimum wage entry level jobs. Fast food, retail, entertainment... I really enjoyed customer service actually, but it's not something that I can live off of. I've had medical training and was on the path to becoming a nurse for awhile when I dropped out because of how unhealthy I was at the time. I needed to get myself in order. And since then, it's been a couple of months and I feel my entire drive to the medical field has been lost and I have no idea what it was I saw in it anymore.\n\nOn top of this I have an anxiety disorder which makes suffering through a job for longer than a year or even just a few months difficult(a thing that I guess a lot of ENFPs have trouble with), I'm constantly feeling anxious and beating myself up for basically having no part of my life together. I know I've heard the whole, "Pick a career you can endure for awhile while you figure out one you actually like," bit. But even ones I "can endure" don't pay enough to make ends meet and I basically feel like I'm stuck as a "failure."\n\nDoes anyone else ever feel like this? Any tips on how to stop this, or how I can start to figure out what career path I can be on?
11	The only advice I can give is to be easy on yourself. Every different career path that you've had helped to clarify exactly what you really want, and you couldn't have known without trying it all. Trust yourself and trust that your path is leading to something hugely fulfilling and rewarding, and cherish this time you have to figure yourself out and learn more. We have the creativity to imagine really bright, really out-of-the-box futures, so don't limit yourself by making your current situation too relevant. \n\nOn a more personal note, I'm *dreaming* of a life more like yours, dabbling in many different crafts and exploring more of my interests. Medical school hasn't really allowed for as much time and creativity. 
3	Best job I had was 14k a year sorting through trolleys of items lost in the post for an auction house. I even worked Saturdays for free. I Loved the people, the customers and loved the job. It was different every day and seeing the fruits of your labor when the random items you found sell was exciting.\n\nI was there for 4 years after uni and made redundant when I relocated with the company to Thier (now failed) warehouse/online sales idea.. I was gutted.\n\nI went to a car auction after redundancy and tried to become an auctioneer, but failed as they stopped training them shortly after I joined. My role there was basically a receptionist and complaints handler, but the people were alright.\n\nI needed more cash so I found the first job my photography degree got me; taking photos of car parts and running the website for a small motorsports components company. I basically sat on my own all day with a camera and a website and it killed me for a year and a half.. it also bought up childhood bullying i repressed and the anxiety I always drank away and I quit. I have been in CBT therapy for months, and I was on benefits until i got my new job.\n\nNew job is photographing cars and managing trade sales for a Vauxhall dealer (guess they are Opel in the US) which pays the bills and more and is going ok so far.\n\n\nI would focus on hobbies to be honest, until a career seems right. It takes a while and I have done loads of buying and selling, delivering things, nightclub photography and always trying side hustles... But as a 29 year old who has had many a job, open water swimming, making music, cooking and baking always make me feel calm am centred, whereas the hunt for the perfect career always left me feeling like a failure, stressed and depressed.\n\nJobs are just Jobs, you go there, you get your credits to spend, you pay bills and treat yourself. Build hobbies, relationships and cultivate a sense of self.. read books, paint, draw, explore, jog around your town or city, get involved  in random classes... dont let a job define you and don't search for the perfect career (as hard as it is I know) because everyone's job has a shit side they don't tell you about, because that's what most work is. Shit, but you gotta do it \n\nMake your life your career, and if you don't like your job, just chill, have a go at another and you will find your feet and something you enjoy.\n\nThat's my (maybe shit?) Advice.\n\n\n\n\n
6	Hey,\n\nso are you self diagnosed or did you seek out for professional help already ? Thats the most important thing, because to search for solutions on reddit or wherever on google is often just a symptom of an anxiety disorder. And even if you get a satisfying answer here, tomorrow you'll have the same problems again.   \n\n\nYour problem is probably that you're too self centered right now, you put way too much pressure on yourself and try to work on something that you can't figure out by overthinking again and again.. Don't get me wrong it's a symptom of an anxiety disorder and you will find your way out sometime. But what you need is someone professional to talk to and rearrange your goals. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd please please please I don't know how much you're guided by this MBTI thing... It's just a personality test. I hope that there more than 90 questions about you to answer before someone knows "everything" about you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	I don‚Äôt have concrete advice because I‚Äôm going through something similar and trying to pull myself out of it. I (26F) moved back in with my parents for grad school (MFA fiction writing). I really feel like I‚Äôm in the only career I will ever be good at, and teaching is rewarding at times but also stressful. I haven‚Äôt been getting positive feedback in my writing so I haven‚Äôt been submitting to places and getting the external validation I‚Äôm used to and as a result I feel like I‚Äôm not a good writer and don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm still in the program. But I‚Äôm halfway through and know it is depression and anxiety and mental illness in me that wants to quit.\n\nHave you ever tried DBT workbooks for therapy? They help me logic out why I‚Äôm having strong impulsive emotions.\n\nTake care!
1	Any job can be fun if you work with the right people! Life is fluid and we can do just about anything we put our minds to! Just finished working my way up in a company over 5 years (started at 25 years old) from call center customer service agent as a temp ‚Äòone year tops‚Äô job to a Senior Client Services Analyst. I worked hard, gained great experience, and observed as much as I could to gain free skills! I took side projects above my position and was not afraid to make mistakes since I made sure my managers knew I was learning. All the knowledge will serve me in other various positions in the future. \n\nIt was fun in the beginning but, the people I eventually came to work with in the end after layoffs was not the cream of the crop. So, I stepped down and am working on finding my next adventure! \n\nI like looking for tech startups because you get to be a part of the excitement that builds a company. Also, you get to see the inner workings of a baby company. \n\nI‚Äôve learned that I love working in jobs with people but, also that have a quiet time downtime element. Other than that, I try to go into anything that tickles my fancy! \n\nSounds like you have a very cool talent already! You could look into online work, too? I get social anxiety on and off depending on how well i‚Äôm taking care of myself, and in those times I always miss my work from home job!\n\nAll the best to you! 
1	Don't stress out too much about not having the job of your dreams or switching your career around too often. Trust the process and finding something that you are somewhat interested in and stick with it! Times will get hard, but if you keep working at it, success will follow you. :)\n\nPersonally, for me, the reason why I feel anxiety regarding careers and jobs is that I feel as if I will not be good enough or I get overwhelmed and stressed out about the workload. Not sure how much you relate to this, but if you do, I recommend that you pick up the book *Grit* by Angela Duckworth. This book teaches you about the idea of hard work and consistency and the use of passion to show how professionals become the best at what they do. Highly recommend it. It has personally helped with a lot of the anxiety during my current moment of unemployment!

3	Looking for german speaking penfriend	Hi ENFPs.\nI learn german and I thought about how to improve my german so an idea came to my mind to try it here, if there is any nice native german speaking ENFP (or other type as well!) who would be my pen friend to exchange some emails. Currently Im on B1 level but I want to push forward  both - my grammar and vocabulary. I dont expect anyone to teach me (maybe correct sometimes lol) only I need someone to communicate in german with as I have lack opportunities to speak with native germans where I live and I think the conversation (both written and spoken) is essential for progress.
1	I am German and haven't had a penpal/penfriend before. On one hand in intrigued and on the other I feel like it could be bit... unfulfilling? Why not try though heh
1	I'm also german but my communication skills aren't the best.
53	Do you guys ever get overloaded?	Hey fellow enfps! I was just wondering if any of you ever get insanely introverted after spending a couple days heavily social. I just spent the last 10 days on vacation with my family and best friend, which was sick, but now that I‚Äôm home all I want to do is be alone. I‚Äôm not as talkative as I usually am, and I don‚Äôt really wanna text or talk to anyone and when I do talk to people it feels kinda forced. Does this happen to any of you guys and if so, how do you deal with it?
40	Welcome to introvert hotel.  You ENFPs visit said hotel from time to time, unlike 8 other types that have permanent rooms in said hotel.  Yet these 8 other types, myself included, do like to go outside every now and again, from time to time üòâ\n\nMake sure to sign up for the introvert hotel frequent flier card, after 8 stays at our hotel, you are entitled to one hug redeemable at the bearer's of the card request.
15	All the time. I usually just excuse myself, tell people that I'm super overwhelmed at the moment and usually they understand. 
7	Oh my gosh I totally do! I take a few days "off" and isolate myself, basically. Hang out in bed, watch movies, listen to soft music.
5	Ofc
5	Absolutely! Sometimes for weeks at a time depending on how social I‚Äôve had to be recently. 
4	yet, that little bit of extroversion that‚Äôs left slips out in the form of this post :) me too.
3	Yes
3	Deffo
2	Oh yeah. Sometimes I need a whole weekend off.
13	I don‚Äôt relate to feeling taken advantaged of or that I give too much (in relationships)	I do always searching for deeper context and meaning. I can empathize and certainly don‚Äôt mind providing an ear for others that need it. I‚Äôm always revisiting and residing my internal framework. I do try and pre-empt and fulfill people‚Äôs desires though.\n\nBut I have a strong sense of my personal needs, wants, and motives. I never compromise that for others and put myself (fi)rst, so that if need be, I can KEEP being helpful to others.\n\nWhat really drains me is not being able to use Ne. I do have a habit of overpromising, maybe that‚Äôs the people-pleasing part.
2	I suspect this might be more related to Enneagram Type, as Type 2 and Type 9 ENFPs tend to struggle more with feeling taken advantage of or giving too much. Other Enneagram types don't seem to have as many issues with this. 
178	This makes me so sad.	I was driving with someone I consider a friend (we hang out occasionally). I ended up opening up that me being hard on myself often leads to crying sessions. They told me ‚Äúyou?? Hard on yourself?? Yeah right.‚Äù And I asked ‚Äúwhy ‚Äòyeah right‚Äô?‚Äù And they said, ‚Äúif you were hard on yourself you wouldn‚Äôt act the way you do.‚Äù\n\nHonestly I was shocked. I know I have chosen a lighthearted and easy going persona to show to the world, but that doesn‚Äôt come close to who I truly am as a person. I have such high standards for myself - both in my professional and personal life. I lose sleep and have crazy anxiety over the fact that I‚Äôm not performing sufficiently enough to meet my various goals, whatever they may be. The fact that someone (a friend, to be clear) assumed that I was some la-dee-da worry free forest fairy kind of wounded me for a moment. I have learned to accept this viewpoint from acquaintances, but it saddened me to hear that come from a friend. \n\nHave you guys had similar experiences? When will people finally learn that spontaneity does not equal impulsiveness, and that a outwardly positive personality does not mean lack of depth or suffering. 
55	I know exactly what you mean. Unfortunately man people can‚Äôt distinguish, and even I sometimes feel like this and it really upsets me. I stop acting like my normal self, but then usually in a couple of days I decide not to let them affect me and just be myself again.\n\nTry not to let them affect you. As long as you know within yourself that you‚Äôre working as hard as you can. You can‚Äôt control what other people think, so try not to let it affect you.
25	I am the same way. I'm an extreme perfectionist for things I care about, including work. I made a comment to a friend/co-worker one time about how much I berate myself & beat myself up in my head, and her response was, "No, you don't beat yourself up, do you??" \n\n I mean, I just told you that I do, and it basically goes on anytime I mess up, so, yeah. 
26	Yes, outward appearances are deceiving. Sometimes it‚Äôs the funny outgoing person who is the most clinically depressed. Look how many comedians struggle with it! I don‚Äôt do it very much these days, but in the past I‚Äôve been extremely anxious and perfectionistic and self critical. Part of it would COME from the fact that people around me assumed that I was dumb and ineffective.  Older me knows I‚Äôm smart (smarter than average) knows I‚Äôm effective, knows I‚Äôm deep and knows I don‚Äôt have to prove it to anybody. I like people who underestimate me- they always end up surprised and often embarrassed.
19	So many people have been tricked into believing that to be successful, you constantly have to be stressed, miserable, and beating yourself up for every little thing you do or don't do. Others have realized that they have the power to control how they react to stress, instead of it controlling them, and are able to keep their heads above water instead of succumbing to it. We ENFPs are not happy-go-lucky and blank-minded all the time, even if we look it - many of us have simply learned that we can choose how we react to things. Realizing you have the power to not automatically drown in misery is one of the biggest, most powerful secrets in life - and those that haven't figured it out yet are always intensely jealous and baffled over those that have. Please, don't let anyone guilt or shame you for being more outwardly emotionally stable than them - no matter what they say!
6	Have they not heard of Robin Williams? Just because someone has a fun outside doesn't mean their inside isn't very troubled.
17	Ask this person what actions they're referring to. You're probably talking at crossed purposes, based on unspoken assumptions about what each of you, and others in general value. You've focused on your outgoing demeanour as 'acting the way you do' but that may not be the point. We all have blind spots.
5	Yes thank you for posting. Can relate
6	I had a surprisingly similar experience which literally HURT my heart and changed my perception of that friend.  She asked me why I cut my hair so short, so instead of lying or deciding to cover up my problems for once, I opened up and decided to tell her why. \n\nThis was a pretty big deal for me as I usually don't open up about personal problems even to my closest friends. \n\nI told her I decided to cut my hair because my hair was falling out, I had regular hospital appointments for a severe illness and my doctor told me my hair was getting increasingly weak and falling out fast due to severe depression. \n\nThe friend looked me dead in the face and LAUGHED. She laughed.  Then she proceeds to say to me, "why would YOU be depressed?" with the biggest smirk on her face. Another friend was with us out of earshot, then she went and told her and they both laughed about it. \n\nI was so surprised with the way she and her friend reacted, I sat still unable to speak. I was literally speechless. In that moment I hated myself and my stupid ENFP front. The whole day I didnt speak to her because I was so upset, but I don't think she noticed anyway. Whatever.\n\nIt was a big deal for me to open up like that and I don't open up to anyone anymore because of her. It still hurts when I think about it. 
10	To be fully honest, that sounds like a flaw on your friend more than anything. I personally have terrible luck with romantic partners, but my acquintances and friends are all wonderful additions to my life. I've never once opened up to any of them to be met by "lol as iffff". Sure, some people show general disinterest in talking about it, but they don't openly diminish my troubles. All in all I feel that most people I know are wise enough to know that a happy demeanor does not mean everything is going well on the inside.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThough yes, I do believe I'm just somewhat lucky in that aspect. I'm sorry your friend doesn't value your feelings as true... :(
3	Recently I somehow ended up being conveyed to tell what was the matter with me having a down. I wrote her that for some reason I hate myself occasionally and that I feel like I am unloveable in any way or fashion. Her response was very sweet and something along the lines of "if somebody is, it's you. Just because you don't look for dumb basic bitches that doesn't make you unlovable" and a little more. It made me even sadder for the moment, but it's nice being told something like that either way. 
3	Definitely. My ex wife used to say the same thing sometimes. Then get mad when I reacted poorly. At the time, my emotional responses were extremes, either things couldnt fail or couldnr be fixed. But i digress.\n\nThats a common misconception of our type. The best thing you can do is look at yourself honestly and consider your friends opinion. Are you honestly that way, even to yourself? If not, let it roll off and pay attention to what situations your friend might be talking about. Theres no harm in trying to learn more about yourself and this is something everyone, not just ENFPs, could benefit from.\n\nIntrospection is hard sometimes üòÇ
2	This sucks so much!
2	Ummmm..... YES.  \nI actually just had a similar encounter  last night where a good friend of mine was giving me what he thought was friend jokiness, but it definitely went deeper on my end (as usual). He kept saying weird stuff like how I try to remain an enigma (through my highfalutin banter and outward arms length demeanor?) or how I moved away but they still see me all the time (I moved three hours away and they're like... my favorite friends... so of course I see them every month when I come to town).   \nI feel like they think I've got all this confidence and high self-worth consistently, when it really just comes across that way when I'm in the zone of 10 people all of whom have really cool things to say and I find it easy to feed on that. More often than not though, I'm an absolute mess. I come down from where I live to celebrate their accomplishments while I flounder by myself to create my own.  (goodness forbid they realize that I am a far distance from able enough to do it alone). If I talk about these insecurities I'm never truly heard out, or even worse clappedback with "You sound super insecure right now." Didn't need that thanks. They're all really great people though, and if I was a little more outside my own head I could stand on those pillars and succeed but... meh... I'll keep on trying.
2	YES. I know exactly how this feels. \n\nOne time, I sobbed on the way home from a friends' gathering because we were all having light-hearted conversation and for some reason, a friend called me "petty" and it wasn't meant to be entirely joking, but she said it semi-seriously and my other friend chimed in, agreeing. By the time I could say anything, the conversation moved on.  These were friends I'd known for years, but we were getting to be pretty close and  \*knew\* I never did anything considered to be petty. I have no idea why I was so upset over it, but I guess it was the fact that I let people in and they got it completely wrong about me.  
2	For a lot of time I was that super over enthusiastic peppy person. When I entered high school I developed (eventually diagnosed) clinical depression, but no one would believe me. I‚Äôve literally had people say to my face that they‚Äôre not sure I can feel anything BUT happiness. \n\nProbably the best example of this is a meeting my parents had with my guidance counselor when they finally believed me. I was sitting quietly curled up on a chair while they were talking and explaining the situation and it was one of those days I would‚Äôve rather slipped off the chair and laid in a ball on the floor. My guidance counselor looked *directly at me* and said ‚Äúshe looks totally fine‚Äù. It was then that we learned she‚Äôs an academic counselor and not an emotional one. 
2	OP this is the story of my life... :( \n\nThis is why I have such a difficult time making close friends, yet have a very easy time making friendly aquaintances. \n\nMost people honestly just don't pay enough attention to those around them.
2	\*hugs\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYeah. And it is hard to talk honestly, how hard i can be to myself (for to a point that i practically hate myself). 
2	I have done something similar to an ENFP friend of mine, not as close as bad. It's just hard sometimes to accept that you guys can be both completely distracted and unfocused and committed at the same time. Especially if slight narcissism is involved.\n\nTell your friend, if they really are a friend, how you felt. 
1	Don‚Äôt take it to heart too much. Says more about your friend than it does you. You have a right to self-definition and a right to declare who you are and vocalize your self-reflection. Anyone who cares that much to doubtlessly retort about something you were saying about yourself probably has a chip on their shoulder and just wants an opportunity to divert the attention back to themselves and how much they struggle. Or they don‚Äôt want the discomfort of someone speaking about struggling. You were saying ‚ÄúI struggle‚Äù and they were essentially saying ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt struggle.‚Äù Fuck ‚Äòem. But also know that they are coming from a place of lacking/scarcity not abundance.\n\nEdit: To answer your question, I have gotten this type of reaction before, too. Not lately, but I remember getting this a bit in high school and college. This experience sounds very painful especially coming from a friend. So I feel for you.
1	I've actually said this to my BF! "You don't suffer, you're always making jokes". That's what it looks like. Then I realized it's not true. He doesn't suffer the same way I do, but he still does.
1	It doesn't define you.
1	Who the fuck cares what they think. There's no awards for being hard on yourself. Keep it at it and do things the way they work for you. 
1	One time I told my sister that I failed my exams was because I was depressed and she said "what? You meant you are crazy and you wanna attempt suicide?" And she laughed. She actually thought I was joking when I was really struggling with school.  But I am glad I turn alright now. 
2	Motivational Monday!	\nToday is a new day! A fresh week! An opportunity start something new and get back into life. \n\nWhat inspires you, /r/ENFP?\n\nPost stories, quotes, and images that give you life. Need a little rally? Don't be shy posting your goals; let /r/ENFP give you a pep talk!\n
116	Word for word, this is exactly it chief	
15	As an Enneagram 4 ENFP I super do NOT relate.
16	Ehh, maybe as a teenager but not as an adult.  
7	Also sounds a little ESFP 
5	I know I can struggle with that. I love performing for myself and for others, but if I fail in my responsibilities or in things I eagerly said 'yes!' to, I self judge pretty hard.  
3	Wahhh!\nüò£üò£üò£\nAll true 
3	That's how mafia worksn
3	I‚Äôm a 4w3 ENFP, but I 100% relate to that too! 
3	Why does it say level 5? This is obviously about us 7s üòÇ
2	These are the symptoms of mania.
1	Not me at all. I think I was tested 9w1.
1	Well I guess I just learned today that I am a 5 cause this is so me.... Haha
1	Haha. I noticed from the MN part from your name same as you can know that I was born in '99 haha. I'm from Mongolia, too.
1	Ah haa! You got me! :P
4	Tips for asking an INFP out?	There's this INFP girl (20F) in my drama class which I've (26M) come somewhat close to over the past few months and all of a sudden I've developed a crush on her. \n\nHaving many close friends who are INFPs, I thought this would be fairly easy to pull off (asking her out, I mean), but this girl, in particular, is just tough to read. We've hung out at my place a few times with friends from our drama class; that's how we got closer actually: I asked her if she was into board games a few months back and she said she was, so I invited her over for a game night with my friends and she said she had a great time. Since then we've played a couple more times and recently she even suggested we watched a movie during one of those encounters (all of which are always accompanied by at least two other people.)\n\nThat being said, I'm not afraid to talk to her about how I feel and I'm cool with whatever result that comes from it. What I would like to know, however, is *how* I can best approach her. She told me she's only dated once before (that was a few months back and she broke it off saying her ex rarely wanted to hang out with her) and even though I wouldn't call her shy, I suspect a direct, in-your-face approach might scare her off.\n\nSo my dear Redditors, what do you think of this? Fellow ENFPs, how would you act in these circumstances? Lovely INFPs, how would you like to be approached in a situation like this? As always, you're the best and I love you all. Thank you for reading! <3
3	I had success with an INFP woman when I just was upfront and asked her out, then the date went well because I built her up like crazy the more she shared with me. \n\nThey Love authenticity and courage. She told me at first she did not want to go out, but respected my courage to ask her like that and turned out she really really liked me after. 
2	Hey! Female INFP here. I would suggest you should ask her out to spend meaningful time together 1:1. Maybe you have shared interests? I love going to the opera, art museums, movies PLUS as a must to hang out at a caf√©, bar, at home etc afterwards where you are able to talk in private and discuss your worldviews, family and friends relationships, dreams. You could also invite her over to cook something together (maybe foreign cuisine, a fancier dish, a dessert you both love etc)? Try to be open and show your vulnerable side, your insecurities (even if you are not used to) and understand hers. Good luck!
1	I used to like an INFP friend last year (and he liked me!). Normally, I take the "leading" part and ask the other person out, but this time, I'm not sure why, I let things just happen. And they happened.\n\nWe were constantly chatting and sent each other funny things and also cute messages (that could let the other one know that we had the interest, but it wasn't obvious at all). Since we share our group of friends, we could be together quite often and we spent time together in our micro universe while the others had no idea.\n\nAt the end things happened, we watched films in group, but ended up holding each other's hands and that kind of things. Then one day we just saw each other and we kissed, so naturally, so expected but not planned... it was nice.\n\nWe are no longer together (no drama involved! our feelings just fade away, maybe it was just a summer romance after all?), but we are great friends and still share our friends (and also, why not mentioning it, we are also friends with "benefits" iynwim)\n\nWhat I would get out of this is that maybe you don't have to do anything more than spending time together, having meaningful conversations and keep the flame high, it will cook naturally. But this is not the absolute advice! Asking her out wouldn't be "forcing things" or anything!
1	I too am into an INFP, but our story is a bit different. It's really personal, but I really want to help you, since it's great having an INFP as your partner. \n\nMet her at a New Years Eve Party by my cousin's. We were just playing X-box games, talking about stuff with everyone, and then I realized, that a girl was sitting in the other end of the couch, looking at her phone. I was already flirting with 3 other girls, but I was like "I'm not letting her to miss out on the party so I tried to initiate a conversation with her."  She had a pink ACDC sweater on, I asked if she listens to them, or just likes the design. We then talkef for a good 5 hours straight. I kinda played around with the idea of dating her, but she brang up that she had a boyfriend so I just dropped that idea.\n\nFast forward a bit, and we are bestfriends or more like soulmates. She told me things even her boyfriend didn't get to know. Depression, sh. Etc.\nWe met a lot of times and started developing a crush on eachother a few weeks after she broke up with her boyfriend. We really became a really important person in eachother's lives. Then I got a girlfriend and I've seen the signs of her becoming a bit sad because of it. (She was really good at hiding them.) I broke up with my girl in a few weeks (It was a long distance relationship and she couldn't maintain). We had our first date then with my INFP. It really was more romantic then our other meetings, but it wasn't like an official date, we just mark it as our first one. \n\nThen a week or two later, she got the idea that she would like to drink some champaign with me, on the way home we started cuddling in the back of the bus, and when we got home (we haven't yet drinken at that point.) we had our first kiss. \n\nThe next day, we met to talk about the situation, and decided we should try being in a relationship together. \n\nShe barely ever gave me any signs of a crush, but everyone told us that we do look like a couple. They predicted us having a crush on eachother. It was really funny to talk about it before our relationship. She always pointed out how she didn't want to be in another relationship for the next few years. It was really hard to see it coming. It was spontaneous. 
3	I sent this to my ex	Here‚Äôs the full text message I sent to my ex.\nTW quite intense but I thought some ENFP‚Äôs might relate. ¬´¬†I am honestly pissed about the fact that you‚Äôre the only guy that I like to sort of have an intelligent conversation with. There are so many guys that are sort of dying for my attention and yet I only choose to share these thoughts with you even though I don‚Äôt even receive a decent amount of reaction and interest from your side. I know that I do seek attention and am intense in many - or should I say any ? - way but I sort of look at my relationship with ‚Äúguys‚Äù and I am being ignored by those whose attention I value or enjoy. I might just as well be deluding myself into believing that there are that many people who ‚Äúwant‚Äù to hear my thoughts- or, should I say, want to get involved in and depth- and time-‚Äúintense‚Äù discussion on different personal, experiential and non-personal topics; and that I just have a few stalkers that I actually don‚Äôt stalk. In the end, there‚Äôa some loveliness and liveliness to loneliness. The thought that one can be lonely even though there‚Äôs someone out there interested in one provides some sense of entitlement to being lonely, as if it was a deliberate choice that one could actually realistically retract. But I think it‚Äôs just a mismatch and demand and supply disproportionality in the market of attention human attention and affection. As well as some underlying predisposition or assymetry of information that leads one to be bad at not being lonely, which might disproportionately affect some of the supply- and demand- side of some segments of the attention market. The question of whether the internet properly addresses this market mismatch remains a large one.¬†¬ª
7	Don‚Äôt send stuff to your ex anymore if they don‚Äôt seem interested and you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs resolvable. Really just give yourself some space and time to be happy on your own. Get to a place where yeah, he might come back, but it doesn‚Äôt matter because your life is wonderful and full of love everywhere. Like I used to put everything I had into love but it wasn‚Äôt enough because I was always reaching for validation. But I don‚Äôt need validation I know I‚Äôve got an interesting and full life of friends, hobbies, and school, and that I take good care of myself and love myself. That‚Äôs where the good shit is, when a guy can just be a ‚Äúpart‚Äù of your complete and happy life, not the end-all-be-all to your well-being\n\nPs I‚Äôm back with the dude. But if he broke up with me tomorrow I‚Äôd be upset and grieve, but I know I‚Äôd be okay and find love again. But I know how heart-wrenching and empty a break up can make you feel. Take your time to let it all out and keep caring for yourself at the end of the day.
2	The underlying question is why are there so many that all feel lonely.
2	Many people feel lonely because there are too many self centered and ego tripping devices around us. With this comes the dilemma of emotional immaturity on a mass scale. With this comes lack of courage to open up to others, lack of courage to show vulnerability. It is so much easier to play with  dopamine fixes from social media, junk food, video games, porn, netflix marathons, that anyone can get the illusion that they are not lonely, even though they are dying on the inside. This also makes people lazy when it comes to the emotional work that is required to make a relationship run, it is just easier to just let technology take over and never show vulnerability, like never.\n\n&#x200B;
1	I really appreciate it thanks 
1	I really like your take on technology.
3	ENFP with a potentially very unhealthy cognitive stack.	A healthy cognitive function stack for an ENFP should be Ne > Fi > Te > Si, however after recently taking a couple of cognitive function tests my stack looks like Ne > Fe > Si > Fi.\n\nAn INFJ friend of mine was quite alarmed by my result, suggesting that perhaps my high Si is a sign of holding onto too much past trauma. But in myself, I often find it difficult and unnecessary to hold onto negative, bitter experiences.\n\nUpon a bit more introspection I realised I'm quite the victim of the [wounded healer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_healer) complex. This helps explain my very high Fe, but I can't quite explain my high Si. I'm looking for ways to increase my Fi and lower my Fe, then increase my Te and lower my Si. I'm quite new to understanding these cognitive functions so any help/advice is most welcome!\n\nTL;DR - I need to develop my Te and Fi while dropping my alarmingly high Fe and Si. 
4	Tests are unreliable and in my opinion bull. Study the cognitive functions for yourself. https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/if-youre-confused-about-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-read-this-an-intro-to-cognitive-functions/\n\nAnd this site gives a really good, in-depth cognitive function description of ENFP that may explain some of the peculiarities you are having: https://www.typeinmind.com/nefi
3	... I think you're a bit confused, mate. You can't be a Fe and Fi user. Go for an official MBTI test if you want legitimate results.
2	Don't take those cognitive function tests too seriously. \n\nOne thing I've noticed when taking those tests, is that I usually score high on both categories of my first 2 functions. For me, being Ti/Se, I usually score relatively high on Te/Si, as well. \n\nI also tend to score higher on Fi than Fe. \n\nTl;dr-Crap's broken, just read about the functions.
1	This sounds like lack of emotional processing to me. Trapped emotions that need to be voiced and felt and then you can be free their heavy burdens. The cognitive stack is just a natural flow, if your Te was not so good, than you would be able to write so directly and fluid like you do. 
4	Being ignored	How do you guys deal when someone just stops answering and kinda ghosts you, it sucks, and you have no fucking idea if you did something wrong, but I keep going over it and find no clues, its the worst specially when the person seemed to have shown lots of interest before, can someone really be like "yeah I don't feel like talking to him ever again after saying I miss him so much", I understand mood swings and jumping into new projects, but I would never leave someone hanging... We enfps would never do that, why is done to us? 
3	I guess I got ghosted by a dude a few months ago. We had been on a few dates that all ended in sex, I'd made him dinner once, he praised me for both kitchen and bedroom skills and even joked that it makes me a "dream lady". Barring how sexist that is, it was meant as a joke, and gave the impression that he was at least somewhat interested. But soon after we lost touch and he didn't reply to a message I sent. Granted, I didn't pry and send more than one, it's still just some tinder dates - although I did like the connection we were building and was disappointed in the end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo in conclusion, I suppose it just makes me wonder. My guess is something beyond my control happened, or he's not actually down for commitment, and didn't have the spine to talk about it. To be fully fair I'm not sure I needed to talk it out: it was still a very new connection. Sometimes people meet someone else, or their motivations change, or they don't want to deal with their feelings and hide - which I personally, out of all these three, despise the most. It leads to nothing and just damages the person all the more!
3	An ENFP just did this to me.\nPlease don't ruminate on it, it won't help. You don't need anybody who's treating you this way! You need to realize that you are good enough and there will be other people who will value and appreciate you! You most likely didn't do anything wrong! Be thankful they dissapeared from your life. Better sooner than later because they clearly aren't for you!
3	Think of people as streams. Sometimes they will connect to your stream, and other times they will need to disconnect. Maybe later on your streams will align again, if there isn't any resistance.
4	ENFP feeling down recently (need ur opinion)	Okay guys, first of all I want to say that I've done the test a few times and I'm definitely ENFP (male)(been doing it at my high and low times like rn). I am usually the loudest, cheerful person, with a lot of friends and aquistances, been doing great on college, have a wonderful roomate, supporting family (no gf currently).\nThe thing is that lately i just feel... down. Like I dont feel like myself anymore. I have low energy and can't sleep much. Its like all of the things that ever bothered me are coming to the surface now. I've been bullied (okay not too much) that I'm gay when I was in primary school and it kinda made an inpact on me. Not saying that is the reason but maybe i supressed it.  I never had a gf but been with a couple of them. Like this past month or so I feel like I have 0 self worth and confidence. My toughts are all over the place and I constanly repeat in my head what to say. I also zoon out and constanlty feel like I'm somewhere between conscious and uncoscious state. I misplace my things much more then before and constanly turn my head left and right like I am in alert mode all the time. I dont enjoy compny of others and my closest friends have told me that my jokes became too cinycal and harah and that i transmit negative energy. Even a relationahip aith my roomate is far from good. I have a feeling people are scared of me because im too sarcastic (but things amd\njokes that i say in my head sound funny haha). \nI really don't know what is the problem. Even weed doesnt feel good to me anymore, and cant even go with my friends for a drink because I feel anxious around people (and I always had more energy when I spent time with people before!!!) Like i dont know what to say anymore, my brain filters every single thing in a negative way. I meditated and had something like a spiritual awakening half a year ago but it faded and everything went back to normal, only this last 2 months are really getting on my nerves. I read this book that gave me some couragesness to overcome this state by just allowing myself to feel that bad emergy and let it just leave trough me. \nMy memory is also catastrophical, like I cant even make jokes or remember song lyrics (?). And the more I try to find the reason why I feel like this the further it goes.\nPlease I'd really apreciate your responses and toughts on this one. Thanks and much love!üñêüèª
4	I‚Äôve been there. Age 8-12 I was the most hyper class clown, absolutely bouncy and obnoxious. But from age 13 to 19 I was the very opposite- I went from class president to refusing to have birthday parties because I had no friends and did not want to see people. No one seemed to understand the emptiness and sadness that I picked up on and I felt largely invisible. I did not relate to anyone . A number of external things contributed to this but I also think it was a growth stage for me. I was learning that many things about reality were far from pleasant or right when before I had been oblivious. I also had my own family struggles that no one I knew was going through that I couldn‚Äôt talk to anyone about. I also learned that my previous boundless energy/Inspiration/optimism mindset did not solve certain problems and issues effectively. I needed more depth- my mind did a natural pendulum swing in the opposite direction. My personality changed permanently from those dark times and honestly I‚Äôm really glad it did. I learned a lot and think I‚Äôm much more balanced as a person. I‚Äôve learned to get energy and fulfillment from things beyond my default energy/optimism state. People who were attracted to you for your initial qualities might not stick around while you go through this balancing phase. I think we tend to attract people who want to feed off our charisma, which is not a very good dynamic for us. Remember too that life has many ‚Äúup‚Äù periods and ‚Äúdown‚Äù periods as you grow. You will also gain friends and lose them. The most important thing is to embrace the new things you find in yourself and work to understand them, and stay working toward goals. I‚Äôll add that I‚Äôve dated some male ENFPs who were extremely masculine and strong- people frequently draw all sorts of extreme and incorrect judgments about certain aspects of our personality and while it can be annoying I now just let it amuse me because they sooner or later learn that their judgments about me were dead wrong. Being in your 20s also  just sucks sometimes. I know myself so much better now at 30. I‚Äôm more certain of myself and happier from within myself. A lot of that is probably just a maturation thing, but working toward accepting all parts of who you are and believing in yourself is a big deal. I wish I had arrived here at a younger age!
2	https://youtu.be/aoe1-YXuuKU\n\nI know religious thoughts aren't the most popular these days, but I really do believe we have  a loving Heavenly Father, and that this life has a bigger purpose than we sometimes see. \n\nI'd recommend avoiding things like pot and alcohol because they provide very fleeting highs and oftentimes lead to more enduring lows.
2	Hi,I feel you,It's really tough when everything seems not going on your way.I do have the same experience [before.Like](https://before.Like) my friends seems talking behind my back,my relationship was not going so well.The people around me specially to all the person i looked up to seems doesn't like me that much. If I figured it out, I always intend to mind people what they think of me. What I did as a start to know what really the main problem.I tried to write letters to God since He is the only one who could listen to me without any blemish and judgement. Then I started listening to Him what He wants me to understand since He knows me well than anyone else. If you seek Him and His words,He is gracious and very visible to you. Right there I heard Him saying that I don't need anyone approval whether they like me or not, And I don't need to keep on trying myself to like by anyone or to love by them since He love me no matter what I do,no matter what I said. He loves me who I am,Who I was and Who I wanna be. MAybe in this time of wondering who you are, and what is really happening. There's no one could help you,But only God can do,He knows you from every detail you have in mind. He knows you well.He knows your heart breaks,He knows your worries. But God said during those times.He is with you no matter what. Talk to Him. Go to Him. He is the rescue you are looking for. He is ready to grab you and catch you for His warm embrace. And telling you,He never leave you nor forsakes you.He will be with you just call upon Him.
1	I‚Äôm not a psychiatrist/psychologist so don‚Äôt take this as medical advice - but as someone who has been depressed, I‚Äôm convinced you have depression.\n\nDo you have access to a therapist? This is not an ENFP-specific problem, not a result of ‚Äúnegative thinking‚Äù or anything that‚Äôs your own fault. Depression is not something that has a clear cause and an easy solution. Just a very common mental illness that may be helped through medication or therapy.\n\nI also understand the impulse to try and ‚Äúget through this yourself‚Äù, but the true strength comes from being able to admit that you might need help with this. I hope you feel better man - it gets easier.
1	Well the truth is there may not be a cause. It sounds like you are experiencing depression. And that can sometimes just happen without any cause. I would suggest consulting a therapist and seeing what they say and maybe getting some therapy.
1	This is really beautiful. Thank you!üíõ
6	ENFPs, do you sometimes lie to make someone feel good/better?	Or are all your compliments genuine? \n\nThanks
12	My compliments are genuine. If I am specifically asked if I like something and I don't I'll be tactful and say something like "It isn't something I'd personally wear but the colour is pretty / it suits you"
6	I try to stay honest all the time. If I offer a compliment it‚Äôs genuine. However oftentimes if someone keeps baiting (‚Äúyeah it‚Äôs fine‚Äù) or is showing me something they worked hard on (‚Äúwow good job‚Äù) something that I don‚Äôt particularly believe will slip out. HOWEVER, I do strictly believe we operate out of our own perceptions. So I only say these things if I believe it is harmless and probably looks good in the eyes of others. If it‚Äôs about actions or reality, I won‚Äôt lie to people. \n\nEx: my mom really wanted to buy this dress that was colorful, however I don‚Äôt really like wearing bright color. I thought the dress looked bad (design wise) in my opinion. However I know it‚Äôs my mom style and I know other people would like it and I saw that my mom really needed my validation in order to get it, so I told her it was fine and that she looked good in it. \n\nEx: my friend did a presentation and asked how she did and I told her she did okay other than the fact that she missed a few things here and there, but overall she did good and those screw ups weren‚Äôt memorable. However I brought up things that clearly she didn‚Äôt do well, nicely packaged in a compliment sandwich. \n\nI never say things to bring people down, but I‚Äôm honest. If I personally reach out to say something I mean it. The few times I say compliments that I don‚Äôt 100% feel is when I don‚Äôt believe the opposite to be true and I feel it is necessary to bring the person up to a place where they need to be. 
6	i do sometimes dig deeper than i need to in order to compliment someone because i observe that they might really need a boost - but it‚Äôs never a lie, just something i might not normally mention or pay attention to. 
3	For me I never lie if I can help it, especially with compliments. It is always completely genuine. Believe it. I don't believe in white lies or trying to make someone feel better through false flattery. Because if it isn't true it is fake and also if you say someone looks good when they don't or are good at something they aren't they will believe that and potentially get embarrassed when they show others. That's not very kind. I would rather tell them the truth and try to help them be better.
2	Almost never. I dont want people to lie to me so I dont lie them. 
2	Compliments are genuine. Sometimes exaggerated. Never a lie. We just be positive. 
1	i do sometimes dig deeper than i need to in order to compliment someone because i observe that they might really need a boost - but it‚Äôs never a lie, just something i might not normally mention or pay attention to. 
1	Compliments are genuine here. I'll find a way to bring up problems in the most constructive way possible.
1	I honestly don't give a compliment if it's not genuine, so I don't give them very often. But when I want to give one, I'll give it to anyone, stranger or not.\n\nSometimes, my friends have called me out for my wording lmao! Recently, my friend was ruminating out loud about wondering what he looks like on the outside in front of other people, and I said "You look good from the outside!" in response. Apparently, it was taken as, "...but not on the inside..", which was a complete accident! We laughed about it after, but sometimes I'm too specific in my compliments in order for them to be accurate, if that makes sense.
1	I do it, but it's very rare and I tend not to do it if not really needed!\nI also thought "hey, this post is interesting. Everyone replied saying that they never do it. Maybe OP would be happy to hear that someone does it, if I didn't do it probably I would have lied saying YES" :D\n\nBut I do. Seriously. And this is the proof I guess!
1	I try to be truthful. I see disagreeing not so much as a bad thing but a chance to show someone else my point of view or to expose what I like. 
1	Total lies. If it's a specific compliment then it's real but for the most part it's just to build rapport or make someone with shitty self esteem feel good, thus making me feel less like a shit stain on the planet while paradoxically revealing to me the overall selfish motivatons behind the action in it of itself but ultimately making peace with it due to the good feeling I gave the individual involved. Which in itself is selfish cause I only focus on that to make me feel less bad about feeling bad about being fake nice to feel like a good person. ultimately we're all selfish individuals and there's nothing wrong with that. It's natural.  Boom. Revelation acheived.
1	I personally do not lie about compliments. I just try to find a compliment that best suits the person. I'm pretty good at giving them lol
1	Sometimes I soften it/white lie for purposes of not hurting someone's feelings over something small like 'hows my outfit'? or food etc.. if I'm close or comfortable with someone I'll just tell them straight out though because of the security of our relationship.\n\nBut when it comes to important issues I try to be as honest as possible caring more about the principle of the matter than their feelings. Wouldn't this be a lot of people though? not just a type?
110	You're children on Christmas morning everyday and I love it!	You ENFPs see so much potential and happiness in the possibilities of life and just watching you guys brings happiness to me. Thanks for being so beautiful! \n\n- INFP
57	I love being that person and creating fun and happiness for people but man does it suck when our emotional pendulum swings the other way, when times get tough, etc. \n\nThanks for the kind words. 
38	AWWWW, it‚Äôs nice to see people view it as a positive instead of us as being annoying 
11	Yeah, I've always wanted to be a person that spreads sunshine wherever I can, and unfortunately, life has been so difficult for me and now I'm surrounded by really awful negative people who don't really care about happiness. Most of them have addictions and mental health issues. A true drain on my ability to be myself.  I really look forward to finding a safe environment where I can let my light shine and not have someone bashing me the minute I wake up in the morning.
8	What are INFP like everyday? 
7	Children on Xmas morning is a perfect description! I forget how ENFP I am until I read about it again. üòÇ
4	You just haven't seen us in our sad states, or emotional states, or our quiet introspective, alone time state which is most of the time for me and many other ENFP's.
3	I wake my kids up around 6 every time, I can't help it. 
2	<3 thank you
1	THANK YOU this is like Christmas I'm so happy
1	Some ENFs are like that. But I think children eager to open presents belongs to the same ENF archetype as the [Greedy Jewish Merchant](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/007/617/jew_basic.jpg), among others. Keep that in mind.
5	How to get an ENFP to forgive me	I'm an INFJ female and I met an amazing ENFP a few months ago while travelling. Spent 1 month with him then a few months long distance.\n\nLong story short, I was an absolute toxic pain in the ass during the long distance phase. I was demanding and saying really hurtful things when I didn't get my unrealistic expectations met. I expected him to make me happy. \n\nI have identified my issues and I'm currently working on them. I have apologised sincerely and I'm trying my best to show him that I care about him but at the same time I'm focusing on taking care of myself and making myself happy, then sharing the happiness with him. I am trying to be positive and drama-free, and I will be moving to his city for a month (and maybe more if it works, I work remotely). This was a major source of conflict, because I expected him to come to my city to prove he cared. Yes, I have abandonment and daddy issues, I'm sorry. \n\nAnyways, he says he forgives me and he's happy that I'm moving there for a while but I can feel he's colder than before. I completely understand it and I plan to keep on being independent, positive and doing nice things for him until the ice melts. \n\nAny tips? Anyone who can tell me how he must be feeling? He just says there's nothing wrong but he's definitely distant.\n\nThank you
9	The way you get anyone to forgive you. Show you‚Äôve changed through your actions. I‚Äôm sure once you‚Äôre back in his city and you‚Äôre hanging out occasionally he might warm back up. ENFPs do forgive easily, but we can be cautious when it comes to matters of the heart. It will take time and him seeing changes. 
8	ENFPs do not readily hold grudges. It‚Äôs either\n\nA: You wronged him so deeply that you actually managed to make him to be wary of you. \n\nB: He found someone else who he finds more interesting currently.\n\nChances are it‚Äôs B but it is for you to determine. 
2	He's probably just building his trust with you, seeing what happens. like anyone/ type :)\n\nBe open and honest with him, let him know why (the issues you identified within) you reacted the way you did, and if you genuinely care he'll know- and will forgive/ has forgiven you probably. \n\n&#x200B;
2	Unrequited love as an ENFP...Solution?	Hey guys! First post here :)\nI have been lately struggling with the fact that my love toward a friend is unrequited and (perhaps as an ENFP) all I wanna do now is completely retract and withhold my love from her. I already have a reputation of withdrawing, but I don't see another solution to protect my heart from the pain of not receiving it back. And the more complicated part is that we are roommates. Anyone have a similar experience? I know it's just a friend, but friends are particularly special to me and I have had my heart broken many times. 
7	I‚Äôd recommend reading up on the merits of secure attachment and how to be secure and seek out secure people. Wired for Dating is an EXCELLENT book on this based on the neurobiology of attraction and mating. \n\nBasically, a securely attached person doesn‚Äôt withhold love but they also are ok with moving on if compatibility with someone isn‚Äôt happening because they truly believe in their own ability to find attractive people who love them. They don‚Äôt play games and they let go with grace if necessary, and they are overall the healthiest longest lasting and lowest drama type of person you can find. I work towards being that and finding that in my dating partners- currently dating a secure INTJ and it‚Äôs far superior than my past insecure pairings!
1	I had a similar experience and honestly my advice would be, move out as soon as you can - because it usually gets worse over time, not better. You really need space to heal and get over her. I'd also recommend this article: [Unrequited Love for a Friend? Here Are 6 Ways to Deal](https://everydayfeminism.com/2016/01/dealing-with-unrequited-love/)
1	Hey, I'm sorry to hear that. I've had a similar experience as well and you're not alone! Even if it does feel like you are.\n\nYeah unrequited love has always been tough for me. I'd say give yourself time to withdraw and allow yourself to heal. The longer you are in her presence, the more it will hurt. You probably don't want to, but do it for yourself. Don't see her again and move on when you can. I remember I became really stubborn and shut everyone out trying to get someone I could never have. It led me to a really dark and unhealthy place. \n\nDon't do what I did and try to keep moving forward. Move out and find somewhere else to live. You may crumble, but just remember you're strong and you will get better, one day at a time.    \n\nTry to talk to someone you trust about it. Once you've healed a bit, hangout with some friends that will make you whole again. When you're ready, do the things you love to do and focus on it.  
4	Is anyone else sometimes anxious-preoccupied?	I see a lot of posts about feeling suffocated and rejecting lovers. Or leaving a lover once they get too emotional. I can't really relate this at all. I committed pretty hard pretty early on and I guess I'm just curious about the perspective that feels no remorse about going into something just reject it for (what appears to be?) superficial reasons.
1	If you check out articles on avoidance you can come to understand it more. I think the thing some people overlook too is chasing after an avoidant person can make you extra anxious preoccupied even if you were secure before! I score secure now but when I was with (chasing, more like) my dismissive avoidant INTJ ex I was an anxious mess. It was so taxing on my vitality I do not recommend it to anyone. If however you are finding that you are anxious preoccupied even in a secure relationship, that might be something to work on with a therapist who specializes in that kind of thing. I saw one while I was anxious preoccupied and it helped a lot, but getting away from the avoidant partner was like taking an instant sanity pill!
19	I'm an interesting low-key ENFP	I know I'm an ENFP (male 19) but sometimes I really question it. I read stories posted here and find that many are extremely outwardly positive and peppy. You read their stories and you know for sure they are ENFPs based off that. I haven't asked my friends, but I've been told before that I'm actually kinda a pessimist. I'm also very laid back and emotionally subdued around most people. I get spurts of being super energetic and I'm working to be more like that. I know that I'm an ENFP because I've read hundreds of pieces on the other personalities and ENFP is the only one I relate to on that level where you literally stop reading and vocally say, "holy shit, in definitely an ENFP". My mind functions almost identically to everyone here and I love it. I feel actually accepted, but I can't help but question why I'm not an ENFP on the outside. I'm strange, but not manic pixie dream boy level.
12	Don't worry, I used to be like that too in early high school. It's probably because of our Fi or grumpy Te-Si.\n\nPeople forget that ENFPs can be dark and brooding.
7	Have you read about the cognitive functions? We definitely can be the most introverted extrovert. We are only happy crazy manic pixie like 30% I would say, then we need like a week to rest, learn, go over everything we experienced, etc. It is very possible to be a quiet ENFP, a quiet observer. That's me. I don't even have any friends (I had social anxiety though).\n\nI know you've read a lot of descriptions bit have you read this one? It's all cognitive function based so it explains why, not just what.\n\nhttps://www.typeinmind.com/nefi
5	I'm the same as you until my first year of highschool. I think the main problem for my case is my environment doesn't let me explore the inner ENFP that I'm holding. Mind you that my kindergarten-middle school is an escalator school (So i met the same students every year) and I pretty much felt inferior, had some bullying experiences, so in the end there are part that I couldn't express myself well all those years. When I reach my highschool (different place), I felt a sense of liberation and start doing my ENFP thing, exploring all kind of extracurricular activities, being the open ENFP type, liking everybody because we believe everybody is kind in the inside, so on. Of course nobody is the same, but that could be one of the reason.
3	ENFP are always known as the shy extroverts. There has been too many experiences with people rejecting our off thoughts, questions, and people taking advantage of our vulnerability, that we just shut up till we can feel things out.
2	Dude same! While reading descriptions of ENFPS I can relate 100%... but when people start bringing in their personal stories about how happy and positive they are 100% of the time, they lose me. \nI think we tend to conflate hope with happiness, which is a completely different thing. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm right, but one of the things that strikes me as super ENFP is a really deep feeling that ‚Äúevery thing is going to be alright‚Äù (and by deep I mean sometimes you can‚Äôt even access it! I‚Äôm 3 years older than you, when I was your age I would have NEVER in a million years described myself as a hopeful person). I‚Äôm not sure if other ENFPS can relate to that but looking back I see that it was true, I was always looking forward to a better, brighter future. I just knew things would work out, even if rationally I couldn‚Äôt see it. Tbh with you, I think my over-reliance on reason actually led me into a depressive spiral that lasted for most of childhood... because you see, hope isn‚Äôt rational, is it? It doesn‚Äôt have to be. And most of all, I‚Äôve learned that we, and I mean ALL of us, are as irrational as can be. So why put on a mask and try to power through life based on deduction? Sure you end up protecting yourself more, but as a result you also end up risking less and getting to new things which your rational side never let you see. I hope some of this made sense haha. 
1	I was just about to post a question on here, asking whether I‚Äôm the only ENFP who isn‚Äôt super bouncy positive all the time! Glad to meet another one! I‚Äôm more than twice your age, and definitely ENFP. As much ENFP stuff that I‚Äôve read, I don‚Äôt actually recall reading that we‚Äôre meant to be so chirpy happy. I think that may very well just be a matter of how personal interests affect your personality and whether you‚Äôre actually able to focus on your interests or not. I work for a not for profit organisation and have interests in political and social issues, so that‚Äôs not going to make me bouncy! But I‚Äôd prefer to spend my time writing and making music and I find that hard while eking out a living, so that also makes it a little hard to be super happy. That said, I have a great time with like-minded friends and my family, and they often see me as quite playful and funny. ... In short, I don‚Äôt think there is any particular degree of happiness or sunshiney personality required to be an ENFP. 
1	Wow friend, I totally get this, I think ENFPs can look a little different from each other a lot, have you ever looked at the enneagram? Lots of ENFPs are type 7s but tons are 2s or 4s, and there are even a few 9s hanging around here too (that‚Äôs what I am, and it sounds like you could be too) (but it‚Äôs also possible for pretty much any Etype to go with any MBTI). 
1	From what I see, our greatest gift as ENFP‚Äôs is our empathy and it‚Äôs connection to communication.  A lot of us appear more bubbly than we may truly be because people respond better to positivity.  I have so many masks I use to communicate with people in different settings that for my early/mid 20‚Äôs I had to ask myself which mask was really me.  Now at 29 I‚Äôm starting to understand that they are all me.\n\nOn top of that ‚Äòpeople pleasing‚Äô demeanor, you have ENFP‚Äôs that are more philosophical and idealistic and some who seem to be more material(from what I‚Äôve witnessed on these resort forums).  To me one of our personality traits that calls to me is our drive to make things better.  Some people seem more interested in the bubbly adventure where as others may be extremely adventurous but also extremely concerned with the state of their community, country, world, etc.  Neither one is ‚Äòmore ENFP‚Äô than the other but my guess would be those of us who look at darker parts of humanity may be a little less bubbly in our hearts.  I personally use the bubbly thing more as a tool in life than as my entire personality and you may be the same way... or not, but I‚Äôll stop as I‚Äôm probably beginning to ramble:)  just lean into your adventure/curiosity as well as empathy and you‚Äôll intuit what‚Äôs right for you eventually
1	I actually found a great article on misidentified ENFP‚Äôs.  From the author of the comprehensive ENFP survival guide:\n\n‚ÄòWhereas the ESFP often feels as though they‚Äôre suffocating if they are away from people for too long, the ENFP feels as though they‚Äôre suffocating if they‚Äôre around people for too long, as their dominant extroverted intuition function thrives on idea generation, not direct interaction with their external environment.\n\nESFPs also tend to be more emotionally expressive than the ENFP type, as their emotions are primarily based on what‚Äôs going on in their lives. The ESFP often shares their struggles and dramas freely with others, wanting input as to what others think of the situation (hearing other‚Äôs opinions also helps them to see the situation from other angles and come to a more informed conclusion as to what they should do about it).\n\nENFPs, on the other hand, tend to search for the root cause or underlying reason behind their emotions. Rather than sharing the concrete details of the situation at hand with others, the ENFP is more likely to seek out psychological models that help them to understand why themselves and others are acting and reacting in certain ways. Though they do feel things incredibly deeply, the ENFP takes on a more clinical approach to their feelings than the ESFP, who focuses predominantly on resolving the situation at hand in as direct a fashion as possible.\n\nHowever, ENFPs are often misrepresented as a type that is expressive and dramatic about their feelings, since many ESFPs mistakenly refer to themselves as ENFPs.‚Äô\n\nFrom what I see, there are a lot of bubbly energetic folks who are probably more ESFP than ENFP, but it is a pretty blurry line.  The part where she says ENFP‚Äôs will be bubbly but will need to withdraw rather than crave the interaction speaks to me.
1	Soon to be ENFP mom here. How can we avoid spoiling our child, even tough my husband is rich?	Note: Im ENFP, my husband is INFJ. \n\nIm currently seven months pregnant. She will be our first child. My husband and I very much look forward to being parents. But there is one thing which worries us. We don‚Äôt want our daughter to become a spoiled rich child.\nMy husband and I both grew up in the upper middle class. But when my husband was 17 his moms uncle died. He was very wealthy so he left considerable assets to my mother-in law and her sister. Additionally he created a trust for them and my husband (he has no siblings and cousins). So my husband is a multimillionaire. I actually met my husband when I was thirteen years old. But we didn‚Äôt started dating for more than 10 years. And we both had other relationships beforehand. I occasionally noticed signs that he could be somehow wealthy (vacation destinations, no need for him to work while he was studying, gap year, and he never complained about sth being too expensive) but I honestly did not knew how wealthy he really was until after I got engaged to him.\nAfter our marriage we both kept our jobs because we wanted to do something useful. We did spend some of his capital gains too. For example we live in a really beautiful admittedly extremely large home, we are travelling expensively and we have a cleaning lady. (We also give to charities.) So we do not live an extremely frugal lifestyle. And I feel that being wealthy is a blessing.\nHowever my husband and I have seen several children of wealthy people who are spoiled, mean or arrogant. But we want our daughter to become an emotionally healthy, unspoiled person.\nSo what should we do? 
4	You could give the money you would have spent on expensive toys to charity and just being the kid up to be a regular kid without expensive stuff. 
4	Not a parent here, but I'll share my own approach going into having kids in the future.\n\nFirstly, I think you are already ahead of some simply by asking that question. Many people seem to not care so much about raising their child to become very independent and self sufficient. They will oftentimes use money as some ticket to avoid the emotional trouble from their trouble, causing the child to be more spoiled in the long run.\n\nWith that being said, stand very firm to your individual morals and beliefs and try to show your child why they help you grew to be the person you are today. Don't try to brainwash them, because they too should have a chance to develop their own morals and beliefs. Try and be as supportive as you candor them.\n\nBe kind and good to them. Don't make the world to them feel like flowers and roses, because they'll have to learn the truth the hard way. Don't make the world to them feel like hell because that will strip their ability to dream and grow from experiences.  Pose ideas in the most neutral and unbiased way, so that your kid can judge the statement in a very truthful way.\n\nLast but not least, have fun with them. Treat them to a fun vacation once in a while. Laugh at their corny jokes. Create memories for you and your kid. The fact that you are rich allows you to create pricer experiences for them, so make sure you choose the best experiences for them.\n\nFor other adults, if you are not rich, you don't need the most lucrative life to create any experience for anyone. All you need is love and kindness to help others grow around you. ENFPs are awesome for providing that!\n\nGood luck! Seems like your life is heading towards a new chapter of a beautiful long story (:
3	I wouldn't say a child in a wealthy home will automatically become spoiled. Kids in unhealthy homes can be spoiled. I think it is more about the parents and their attitudes. You can't just give your child everything, cater to their every whim or want. That is how they become spoiled because they learn to expect it. Just instill working for what you want as well as asking fir what you want, manners, please, etc. instead of demanding. And being grateful. Instill gratefulness for what they have and get and to not take it for granted. Let them see how it is for other people and children. You sound like you and your husband are well adjusted and have a good attitude so I think that will be reflected in your child.
3	Former preschool teacher, and current college student studying child development here.\n\nSpoiling only really happens when you give your child things that they did not earn. Imo, it's a common misconception that only rich people can spoil their kids. Spoiling happens simply when you reward bad behavior or give a child something just because they whined for it. You can spoil a child with something as simple as a lollipop. That's why it is so so important to teach children that when they do something right, they'll get a special toy or treat. But if they act out (throw an unnecessary tantrum over wanting a toy, for example), they will not be given what they want. So if your going to give your child a lot of special presents, make sure that when you do, tell them WHY they're getting the toy ("its because you always say please and thank you!" "It's because you've been making so nicely on the potty!" "It's because you've been cleaning up all your toys!"). I've worked with a lot of kids and so far, I've noticed that the only difference between spoiled kids and not-spoiled kids is whether or not the parents give into tantrums and give rewards to "shut them up". Good luck!
1	man just teach them regular discipline, that no means no etc. When kids push to find boundaries and find none they become little screaming tyrants that other people do not like and you will not like. Don‚Äôt do anything that will make you dislike your own kids because you will become resentful towards them if they are not set on a proper path during those first five years. Even as a young one year old don‚Äôt rush in to grab them every time they start crying give them a chance to fight it out their developing brain will learn not to connect screaming with getting their way and that will improve their temperament. Let them see danger, overcoming things is how kids learn to be brave and competent and that carries over into their older years. Don‚Äôt let them be a little more tyrant, they are a 20 pound child, they can certainly eat their dinner don‚Äôt let them overpower you. You are not their friend, you are their parent and even if your wealthy they will not care especially in those formative years.
1	It sounds like charity is already a part of your lives! That helped me growing up :)\n\nI grew up in a poor home but, I believe that volunteering your time as a family will help! Even though we struggled with money as a family growing up, we always helped others and were exposed to as many people groups and other families and backgrounds as possible. My mother was extroverted so, I watched her make all kinds of friends and learned from her. She signed us up as a family for volunteer work around the summer and holiday months. It made the holidays more memorable!\n\nYou can volunteer in a lot of different places. It can suit your interests and you can meet new like minded people while doing it too! I raised money to volunteer in mexico as a teenager a few times. It changed my life and taught me to be grateful for what I have, that happiness is not dependent on how much money you have; that true happiness comes from within because money is just a tool. \n\nAll philosophies that can translate to a better financial situation.\n\nSounds like you‚Äôll be great parents!\n\nEdit: Congrats on your new addition!
1	Mare sure that these nice to have expensive things can your child earn - make her earn it by doing some extra job like helping someone, saving money etc. And tech her that she needs to earn money by hard work so she can worth it and not take it for granted. \n\nDont buy her everything she wants.\n\nDont buy her luxurious stuff like clothes or so, why would kiddos wear dolce&gabbana clothes anyway?\n\nBut first of all - she will see you how you are behaving towards money and finances and she will learn from you. So be an example
1	First of all: CONGRATULATIONSSSS!!!!!!!!!! :D!!!  \nSecond of all: Don't buy her whatever she wants, she has to earn it first! \n\nYou also could show her some kind actions to do with your money, like buying things to donate and stuff :)\n\n&#x200B;

3	Is there one mbti that you really clash with?	One you would even say you hate? One you are least compatible with?
7	It would be INFJ.... But I don't hate them. 
5	Love-hate relationship with ISTJ. \n\nSomebody has to be the party pooper at work when it comes to staying in the now. But in social settings, its draining to practically cajole them into trying something new. 
5	My arch enemies are ESTJs. Distantly followed by ISTJs. 
2	I struggle yet have an initial attraction to INTPs. We can vibe with the same niche jokes and activities but then they can't be as emotional and they are too robotic. 
2	ESTJs  by far. They are the hardest for me to connect with. But eventually a friendship can form and be quite rewarding and fun. However, even with the ones I‚Äôm close to, I still feel like I have to be a bit on my guard and can‚Äôt let my full personality loose. 
1	ENTJ- Harsh and controlling- The ones I've encountered anyways, I just want to sneak past them . It feels like even when you agree with them they have to 'win'. like a loud mouth football fanatic that's also a dictator. I know there are exceptions out there, but from my experience.\n\nESTJ- Similar to the entj with aggressive vibe but not as heavy, more of a jump scare type of person- like that boss that pops up to bark at you and tell you you're not being efficient enough.\n\nI don't hate them, just hard to get close to or get along with. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\-enfp
1	ISFJs-have a very hard time connecting. Awkward silence could go on for days OR I‚Äôd end up chatting about something I give zero ducks about. MIL is this type, and it agitates me how passive aggressive she is. Can‚Äôt do conflict to save her life. Also doesn‚Äôt respect individuality in others and thinks that everyone is just like her.\n\nISTPs-my first boyfriend in college was this. Initially got along due to laid back nature and love for music, but quickly claaashed, He was independent but really misguided (IMO). He would do really risky things that could potentially get him killed or flunk him out of college and then get mad at me when I expressed any concern. He also brought out my inner bitch. He constantly questioned how I KNEW things that I intuited. I love psychology and he thought theories were stupid. Very frustrating. Could be friends or acquaintances with one but not date. 
4	Do ENFPs like jobs with Databases?	Any ENFPs out there have a job with Database Administration or Data Expert fields? I have been learning SQL and I have been having fun with it. I am just curious if any other ENFPs enjoy the database field.
1	I like data science, but I don't think it is because I am typed ENFP. I think it's just my interest in math that continuously grew ever since I was a little boy.
1	No.\nBut I have the attention span of a water dragon.
1	I do, I love it. I love the flexibility and learning new things. I do the analysis for my team too ‚ò∫Ô∏è
1	I am an ENFP who works in IT, this past summer I moved a client of mine over to a new ERP system, I got to use SQL for the setup and found it really fun to use. 
1	ENFP data analyst here. I work in healthcare and I love it. :D\n\n&#x200B;
1	Ugh no. Staring at screens all day with relatively little human interaction just depresses me and stresses me out. But if you like it, go for it :)  Not everyone is the same, not even people with the same type, so just do you :) 
1	I was a DevOps engineer at my last job, but easily 30% of it was DBA type stuff.  Really enjoyed it.  Though it was way more on the system administration side of DBA than SQL.\n\nI have a friend who's either an ENFP or ENFJ and he's a data analyst.  He enjoys the technical stuff, SQL, and development, but really doesn't enjoy the work itself as its mostly putting out fires and cranking our reports as fast as possible.
6	How can an ENFP reach its full potential?	‚Ä¶ Does that make sense? Things an ENFP should focus on working on and stuff like that?
15	Develop your functions. We start out using Ne mostly as a kid but develop Fi more too as teens/20's and late 20's/30's develop Te more then finally Si. So work on those 4 functions. You don't have to wait to mature. Try to do creativity and brainstorming exercises for Ne. Really get in touch with yourself for Fi maybe through mediation and deep reflection as well as things that require you to make choices to really get in touch with who you are and what you want. For Te really try to put stuff into action, which I know is hard for us sometimes but we can't just leave everything as an idea. Do puzzles and things involving strategy and efficiency, problem solving, improving things. Look at inventions or systems and try to see how they can be improved (this uses Ne too). For Si learn the value of routine. I know it can seem boring and even like we're trapped when we are in a routine but it is actually nice and allows us to get things done and also relax. Doing simple routines like washing the dishes allow our minds to relax and we can get lost in the simple repetition.
6	Force yourself to do things you don‚Äôt want to ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø routine and discipline is what we usually tend to lack, and that‚Äôs how it gets developed 
3	The first comment is great! You can also read up on ENFP  ego development: https://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/119376473972/mbti-development-enfp
2	I love this. Thank you. Saved!‚ù§Ô∏è
2	Adopt lots of INFPs. Same stack, just opposite preferred order. They're natural talents at everything you'll need to develop in order to be a well rounded person, vice versa.   \n\n\nYour task is to stop them from wasting energy (usually in their imagination - constant push, zero outer world action). They're bad at Te (efficiency, how-to, outer world realization of dream world). It'll be easy for you, and really rewarding! You'll get to assist someone make their visions meet the outer world!   \nIn exchange, they'll handle your life story like they do theirs, except for kinder. (Because they're energy-wasters and like to use this life-plot-forming-skillset for their own life in replaying humiliating memories and alternative endings to arguments that never took place). I mean; they'll remind, revisit, replay. They'll naturally, accidentally, beautifully jam you in to what was important to you all along but you feared wouldn't be as interesting as a constant shower of novel ideas and a rush of unknown adventure. It'll be interesting, but it'll take someone who's interested in where you're coming from and what motivates you at first. If you're secretly ashamed of all the projects you left half-way through, you may have missed these type of relationships all along. If your area INFPs are secretly ashamed of never living out their dreams, and see folks like us pushing everything neverminding things maybe not working out after all, they may have missed out opportunities like you all along.  \n Find each other and form cognitive batteries. Especially ones in same art / hobby / class / project / work, so it won't be abstract.   \n\n\nOccasionally ENFPs try to push (Te) themselves in to Si. Which goes something like: "Personal development? I GOT IT! I'm going to start a routine and really persist this time!". Just gives you more practice at Te (which is extraverted and you already got it) and wears you out. it's a forced loop, not much to gain long haul. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI grew up with infp sibling and it took me (over) twenty years to learn the beneficial sides of it for both of us. I've attracted plenty of them through my life, though. 
1	Thank you for this :D
102	r/enfp, thank you for helping me not feel like an abomination.	I know that that title probably sounds hella weird but bear with me. Just. I grew up in a pretty messed up home situation and for most of my life, a lot of the characteristic ENFP things i do (bouncing between ideas like there's no tomorrow, introverted extroversion, talking forever about anything under the sun, making awkward corny jokes constantly, etc) were always labeled as stupid and I was always stupid for expecting anyone to think different about them. My mother, who was a narcissist, used my emotional vulnerability and etc to basically rip me a new one emotionally any time she felt inferior. And just between that and a lot of messed up stuff that no random 15 or 16 year old should have to deal with, i basically entered a crypto-depressive "introspection" state. Id sleep 16 hours a day and ponder my own existence and just be exhausted, and i recognize jow that that was depression that had been piggybacking off of the rather natural ENFP "go off and think about life" state. And while ive been on the mend for a while now, finding out that there are more people who feel things like i do is...amazing! I just. I always felt like I was the only one. Not in like an "owo im so special" way, but like i was pathetic and broken for being the way I was and that if I didnt change I'd always be hurt and taken advantage of because of how i am. And just, lurking on this sub has honestly really rekindled my hope. Hope that theres folks that are like me, and that there are people who will take how much we love them and not try to wall us out at every single occasion or use it to hurt us for kicks and giggles. So, just, thank you all for being you.
29	You're *our* abomination üëç
20	That‚Äôs a very honest, open account of how you‚Äôve felt about yourself. And such frankness is refreshing. Thank you for sharing this. \n\nKnow that you‚Äôre not the only one who has felt a misfit or misunderstood (or simply not valued for who we really are). \n\nDon‚Äôt give up. Dig deeper. Learn more about yourself. 
12	You are amazing, never forget that üíó
6	You put into words thoughts I‚Äôve had recently. My cousin and I, we‚Äôre like best friends, one month apart, we grew up together. We did the personality test a few years ago and again recently ‚Äî both came up as ENFP each time. \n\nBut here‚Äôs the thing, people say we‚Äôre quite different from each other. Her upbringing was different to mine even though we‚Äôre related. Her parents, her dad is a narcissist and maybe even a sociopath, her mum severely oppressed and depressed because of a messed up marriage she can‚Äôt leave ‚Äî it made my cousin into a lesser version of herself. I‚Äôve always been able to see her true self underneath it all, even if she hardly has herself. \n\nIt‚Äôs terrible and sad what a family environment can do to a personality. I‚Äôm sorry you went through that too. She is the strongest and happiest person I know because despite all the emotional abuse she‚Äôs received in her life - including always labelled ‚Äòstupid‚Äô, ‚Äòflakey‚Äô, ‚Äòindecisive‚Äô, ‚Äògood for nothing‚Äô, even today at age 34 ‚Äî she is still so bubbly, kind, clever, and tries hard to shine through it all. She‚Äôs had severe depression before where she‚Äôs not been able to get out of bed or function. She finds it difficult to hold down jobs or relationships. But underneath it all there‚Äôs a wonderful ENFP slowly making her way to her full potential. Being an ENFP gets better with age. I see that in her and both of us. \n\nAnyway just wanted to share this as your post reminded me of her and the joys of this space. She doesn‚Äôt use reddit or often have the energy to so I pass on some of the things I learn here to help us both feel a bit more seen and understood. 
10	I definitely feel ya on the people not getting you due to growing up in a similar family, however I was never thought of as stupid due to being one of the smartest people around. This may sound like bragging, but the reality is that most of the people back home are simple minded idiots who just couldn't grasp the concepts I spoke about.\n\nI said all of that to say this: Don't let someone else's fear of the unknown stop you from exploring. Tradition has its place, (that felt disgusting to admit...) but Ne doms like us have the ability to smash the mold and create for the betterment of us all.
3	Big mood on the existential depression I used to do the exact same thing... I'm hella happy to hear ur getting better tho thts awesome! ‚ù§Ô∏è
3	Oh gosh. I went home over the holidays to see people and forget how much that "you're fun so you must be stupid" attitude grinds my gears. Like being bitter somehow makes you smart.
3	More like dabombination. If others, even your family, can't keep up with our thoughts, can't appreciate humor, or are too boring to have cool conversations or allow is our alone time then screw em. There are people out there looking for exactly us.
2	Np
2	MFW this sub is hella in denial about our personality type's high correlation with ADHD.
2	Thank you so much fellow enfp for opening up and talking about this. I relate to pretty much everything you said and I'm sorry you had to go through this. It is horrible to notice every single day that you become less and less like yourself. My mom is a narcissist  and I suspect my dad also. My depression got worse as each year went by and now I understand why I felt so disconnected from my true self. I wasn't so energetic anymore, i completely lost my imagination on the way, I even became attached to things or ideas I didn't like as a cause of my education. With the help of my boyfriend (love him to death), u/raisedbynarcissists (god bless this sub) and of course this sub, I managed to get a lor better. I feel like we are a big family here and it's awesome.
2	Damn. It's like I wrote this.\n\nWe're all here for you fam. ENFPs gotta stick together!
2	this is really nice to read. i completely get what you mean with the over-introspection, i went through a depressive stage like that too. its awesome to hear that someone else like me has been able to overcome that. 
2	Adventure Time Sunday!	\n/r/ENFP! What shenanigans have you been up to this week? Any new adventures planned for the next?\n\nLet's here some stories!
1	I've had a mostly pleasant week! Still in an iffy situation with my ex (not dating in any way, but issues with jealousy and repressed feelings) but I had a few moments that I could set that all aside and just relax and enjoy myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI kind of want to talk about last night, which was a decent party overall, that ended with the doors being open to a really cool big hall next to the dance hall. I was super excited and ran in to look around and finally felt like my giddy self for a bit, only to be met by stone cold non-caring/attempt at non-caring from said ex. I'm not sure why this bothers me so much. My cheeriness is part of my being, and something he has always enjoyed. It felt like such harsh distancing - probably to cover up the feelings some more - and I ended up feeling childish because of it. There was a huge lit basement and several old power generators, with glass ceilings up to four stories high. It was so cool! I don't see why he had to be such a buzzkill about it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis sounds like such a minor thing, I know, but damn does it bother me. 
1	I went to a dog show with my boyfriend and we had the best time walking around and observing all the dogs. We predicted winners and saw so many cuties! Then we made a Civilization together in Civ 6. Good day! 
36	Anyone have problems leading a relationship further than flirting?	It's easy for me to gouge out if someone is interested in me, and I like flirting and teasing, which I do on a regular basis if I'm also interested, but when it comes to actually entering a relationship with the person, I cop out and start questioning if I really connect and match with the person, and I unconsciously try to avoid them. I also start questioning myself and if I really want a relationship at all, if I'm not missing out on something by investing time and emotion in that person. Sometimes I even ask myself if the relationship would even be fair for the other person if I'm not 100% interested, and sometimes I wonder if the relationship would be good for them too. 18 and male if it's important.
13	dude..... that‚Äôs me 100% i‚Äôm struggling with this now!!!!! and i‚Äôm 18 too oh my goodness. can‚Äôt help you out here buddy but i hope someone else can give us some tips here
14	22 F here. I can only tell you that you ought to be with yourself long enough until you find out who you are (or what your needs are), what you want to feel, what your future might look like - only then you will know who do you want to accompany you on that road.\n\nBeing in a relationship is hard, it requires responsibility, mutual respect, willingness to understand another human being, and kindness towards yourself (so that you will be okay with opening up emotionally).\n\nAnyway, don't feel like you're obligated to be in a relationship just because people are doing it. Take your time, meanwhile respect other people's time :) when you feel ready, you'll be ready.\n\nAlso, try to be honest right off the bat. Maybe be friends with them first, don't expect to escalate anything too quickly. And enjoy the fun tho.
6	Tell this, tell the other person exactly how you feel. Allow yourself and the other to open up. Then, once you got that off your back, you can either continue and see where it goes (you can never know beforehand), or decide not to do it. (I‚Äôd pick the first one)
5	Oh wow I feel like I ghost wrote this :S 
4	That's probably an ENFP thing. Trying to figure out if the relationship would be gigafabulous for the counterpart. If this comforts you I'm 23-M and still single. Falling every week for someone else. Maybe that's a loop. Who knows.  \n\n\nOh by the way, I do actually think the key here is to change your surroundings. Try out totally different things that in some way capture your attention. New passions, or even hidden ones you left in some remote place for enough time. The higher the number of encounters the higher the chance that it may work out.   \n\n\nI think I have lost my thought somewhere along the line but maybe you got the point
3	I'd even take it as far as say that maybe the reason I'm "hung up" on terrible former relationships and always divert back to that is just because I'm terrified of a true proper relationship with someone deserving of my time and attention, because maybe I feel like I'd fuck that up entirely/don't actually deserve them. Shrug! Off to waste some more months on a literal human dirtbag! 
3	I'm taking a big break from dating right now. I'm a 26-year-old female. In the past most of my partners have been losers with shitty jobs and not great personalities to go along with them. Whenever I meet somebody I like I tend to get way too overeager and shower them with attention to the point that it scares them off. I think I'm destined to die alone.
3	I am SO like this... I also think it's partly to do with the fact that the person I am interested in at any given moment never seems as enthusiastic as I am about the possibility... one of the things I hate most is giving my all and putting out a ton of energy/effort and not getting anything in return. \n\nI also think it's rare to find someone who can really see me for me. I love the people who can appreciate my quirky positives qualities and who aren't afraid to call me out on my equally quirky negative ones.
1	No, because when I wanted to date someone I would ask them out, get a yes or no, and move forward.
1	Any older ENFPs who do this? I think I know an ENFP who's in his late 30s and might have this problem... 
1	Well relationships don't go from 0 to 100 instantly. The other person is almost certainly thinking the same things you are. It is something you and another person feel out together, how you feel and how the other person feels, always questioning. Questioning can be good. It allows you to truly realize what each other want. The real key is communication. Why don't you voice some of these feelings sometimes, what can it hurt? You might be surprised that they don't know what to feel either. Then you can talk it over together.
5	When you jump from one hobby to another and have to recalibrate	
12	How do you get off those nasty ‚Äúit‚Äôs never going to get better‚Äù thought spirals?	Si is a bitch I suppose.\n\nHow do you guys stop it from taking over?
6	It's kind of lame advice, but the easiest way is to just accept that sometimes it won't and make due with what you're given. I'm not afraid to admit that it took a suicide attempt for me to reach that conclusion if it keeps someone else from doing the same thing.
4	I went through this pretty recently in my job search. I thought it was true until I thought more deeply into if it was really true. Bare me and my mathematical thinking, but here are my conclusions after deep thought:\n\nIn life, there are infinitely many possibilities in the future. Some things are more likely to happen than other things, but they all hold some positive chance (if we ignore scientifically proven impossible events). Your future SO may step on your foot in the next 10 minutes, or you will be fired from your current job in the next hour. The infinite amount of possible possibilities imply that in the future, so many things can happen.\n\nThis is where your optimism can become powerful. Now that you have an infinite amount of possibilities, it's true that your perspective shapes how you view life. You can think of each possibility as a marble, where the red marbles represent bad events in your future and blue marbles represent good events. You have all of the power to choose which marbles are red and blue.\n\nSo let's say you got fired in your current job. Your mind is more willing to think that you are worthless and pathetic, so you start coloring more of your marbles red. This is completely normal and acceptable. The fact that you let "your chance of finding a better job" marble be red, does not change (or should not change much) your likelihood of actually finding that in the future. However by painting more of your marbles red, your emotional reactions could hinder that indirectly. Maybe you decide to drink more often to run away from the problem, causing the actual red marbles to increase their probabilities based on occurrence.\n\nBut if you reframe it positively and think to yourself "well at least I had the opportunity to learn this, this, and that," indirectly this skews more of your marbles to be blue, causing your chance of finding the new job more likely, due to your determination and strength.  It becomes a lot easier to overcome problems when you have a positive personality, and fully believe in it.\n\nResults: after being rejected from JP Morgan's data science position after reaching the final stages of the interview process, I took a few weeks off of the job hunt to let myself grieve. Then I decided to pursue my professional interests by joining a research group, and focusing more on contributing there. I met a colleague who helped me expand my network and from one of the connections, I am now being considered for a data science opportunity with both applied research and client serving projects. This is significantly a better opportunity for me, but fingers crossed here! üòä\n\nMoral of the story is, your perspective can really change things, and to your favor as well, especially if you put more faith into your optimism. ENFPs are powerful at seeing the brighter side of life and it's unbelievable for the pessimists to see how happy you'll eventually become. It's not easy, but try your best to put more faith in your optimism.
3	I went through the downward spiral for a month last december. And very typical of us, from avoidance to shutting down, and my mind just goes wild with worst case scenario. Somehow it gets better this week. Try reaching out, just to the people you really do trust, and if it helps to put your mind at ease, talk to your trusted friend who you know aren't part of your worries in this problem. talk about it, little by little, you'll be released from the shackles. Hope you're getting better, because I did :)
3	Read about brain plasticity. Adjust accordingly. \n\nScience, it works! :) <3
2	I realize I'm not a psychic. I can't see the future. Tomorrow could be the best day of my life. How do I know?
11	Are y‚Äôall allowed to be serious?	First off, I want to apologize for posting so much here, I‚Äôm on a mission. Anyways, I find that I am in high spirits most often when in social situations (mostly just work for me), and my serious side usually I practice in solitude. But I‚Äôve realized that when my mood shifts to serious for a good reason, people act like I‚Äôve lost my mind.\n     I understand, it is out of character for me, and I am usually a very preppy guy. But why am I not allowed to have a serious tone when it‚Äôs actually necessary? Does this happen to y‚Äôall? I find it frustrating. Sorry for the rant. You guys take care.
9	People expect ENFP's to be the fun, silly, random unicorns, not realizing we have a huge deep ocean within us and when we let them peak at  that they get freaked out. People make a conception of you in their head and then suddenly you break that mold and  they are confused at who you are. It is easier for people to place others in certain roles. But people are more complicated than that and certainly ENFP's are.
5	I sort of get the same thing... like people don‚Äôt like when I get serious... but I‚Äôve observed over time that I‚Äôm almost always the last person to take something seriously, and because of that, I bring a much larger tonal shift with me becoming serious. So even though it‚Äôs an appropriate response, the tonal shift that accompanies it makes it appear unwarranted.\n\nI find a good way to minimize this effect is to try and uphold an air of lightheartedness to help make the tonal shift more palatable. Remember, Honey Nut Cheerios without the honey just tastes like cardboard.
2	This isn‚Äôt going to be restricted to any particular personality type. Some people are just intimidated by serious talk, but I assure you that there are times when ENFPs get serious as with any other personality type. \n\nYou might be coming off as aggressive/scared/mad/something else negative if you receive such a consistently negative response to being serious, though?\n\nSometimes I‚Äôll preface being serious with something like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mean to be a stickler‚Äù or ‚ÄúI hate to be a killjoy‚Äù or ‚Äúnot to kill the mood‚Äù or ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be alarmed‚Äù or ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt necessarily a big deal but...‚Äù etc, depending on the situation and who I‚Äôm talking to and how I think they‚Äôll interpret what I say. 
2	Oh yeah, I've totally been down that road before. I also have a group of friends that I tend to discuss more life/philosophy stuff with, and when I bust out a bad pun or want to do something goofy, they act like \*that's\* weird, haha. You just can't win.
7	Me at a club or party	I tend to find the most awkward/quiet person and pull them out to make sure they are comfortable enough to have fun. I move around from group to group doing this until I‚Äôm exhausted then I look at what I‚Äôve done. I really enjoy that feeling of making someone happy for being themselves. I get offered WAY too many drinks and I‚Äôm a male. When I‚Äôm just having fun I just keep it going I don‚Äôt want to get fucked up just happy tipsy. \nYou guys feel this at all?
2	Yup.
2	Facts.
2	I try to do the same, but sometimes I just get bored of the conversations, specially since sometimes is hard for me to get shy people to follow along my jokes and start telling me stories, since I prefer listening than telling my stories over and over again the same night, makes me feel a little shity, specially since some of my friends have pointed out how easy they can tell that I'm more interested in talking with cute girls than everyone else, but that's not true, just that with cute girls the flirting is always entertaining at least. My friend(ESTJ) says I should do like him and get everyone's contact since they can always have something I can take advantage from, but I know if I didn't find the person interesting I would have a hard time keeping contact with them, and I don't want false friends I guess... Hehe do you guys relate? Sorry for the rant, I just realize I sound like a selfish asshole, fuck 
2	ENFPs in UX design: How are you liking it?	I am looking to explore a career in UX research/design.  I do not have a bachelor's degree in human centred design but I do have an international BBA. I'll be taking an OCAD course in UX design in Feb as a first step. I was curious to know what your journeys might have been like as ENFPs in this field. Fun? Boring? Too much computer time? Not enough people? Too much work? Not enough work? Not fulfilling? Best thing that ever happened to you?\n\n If you're someone that did not go to school for something related to UX, what are some challenges you faced/what did you love?\n\nAny answer would really help my extroverted thinking visualize my future! \n\nThanks very much! <3
6	Job hopping	Am I the only one who cant seem to keep the same job for longer than 7 or 8 months? \nIt's not that I'm being let go. I just get a little fed up one day and the next I'm starting a new job. \n
5	I hop a lot, too. However, I have found that I‚Äôve stayed the longest stints have been at places that provide flexibility, community, respect for my position (recognition), variety, and challenges.
2	I have a mix of both! I lose jobs and I leave them! \nWhen I lose jobs, it's usually that I've become more interested in the team than my work.. it's not to say that I'm not doing my work, but I get all mixed up in the work politics, make myself sick with anxiety over the workplace hygiene factors (policy, structure, rules) negatively affecting my friends (or supervisors) and miss days.\n\nMost of the time I just get super bored and stop showing up. This last year I've done various smaller jobs working for myself. Nothing to create a business out of, but enough to make enough money to survive (rent/food) :P
2	I feel it. I've been job hopping for a year now, it's kind of fun\n\nIt's making me realize what I love in life \*most\* and I plan on taking online courses to move towards that goal. I have to be somewhere that allows me to have variety and movement.
1	Sort of, but where I live it is not so easy to find other jobs so it;'s usually I leave a job and then am unemployed a long time looking fir another job.
8	ENFP Self-Pity	Hey, everyone. My ENFP friend who suffers from anxiety and depression struggles with extreme self-pity, and I was wondering if there are any users in the community who have dealt with situations similar to what I describe here.\n\nMy friend has very low self-esteem and resorts to drowning herself in self-pity, fueled by her anxiety and depression. I know that especially with depression and anxiety always on your back, it is remarkably difficult to pull yourself out of the ‚Äúself-pity trap‚Äù or even be willing to. I think it‚Äôs mainly self-pity that‚Äôs keeping my ENFP friend from working towards overcoming her mental illness.\n\nMy ENFP friend tends to be absorbed in thinking that she only has two talents and that she lacks the ability to do most natural things such as understanding people, acting pleasant rather than hostile around them, and feeling sympathy for them. First of all, there are a lot of things that come to mind when I think of her talents, so when she is stuck in this state of mind I remind her of these. I tell her not to worry because it‚Äôs normal for a person to excel at a small variety of things anyway, and I tell her that if she really wants to be good at more things, she should start researching and practicing them. But regarding the people-oriented skills... I struggle to find the advice to comfort her. I want to tell her that if she started trying to avoid being wrapped up in self-pity and focusing on herself so much, it‚Äôd become much easier for her to work on her people skills. However, I feel like it‚Äôs too harsh to put it this way.\n\nI understand that self-pity and mental illness feed off of each other so that my friend‚Äôs destructive thoughts are more difficult to prevent than I can comprehend, but I still wonder if she could be doing more to control them. I just know that there are different ways of reacting to anxiety and depression, and out of these she chooses self-pity. It seems like she 100% believes she wants to be happy, but on the subconscious level, she feels most at home within the self-pity trap. From my own experience, I know that despite feeling like worthless trash while you‚Äôre tearing yourself down, it feels therapeutic to pity yourself whether a person is consciously aware of it or not. I think it‚Äôs similar to self-harm in many aspects.\n\nAre there any ENFPs out there who struggle with self-pity? Is there anything that someone else can do to pull you out of it, or help you to realize what you‚Äôre doing so that you can leave it behind? Has anyone successfully overcome it? All insights and advices from the community will be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading; I apologize for such an unorganized and lengthy ramble.
4	You are not a therapist so realize there are things you can help your friend with, and things you can't help your friend with no matter how you can try but someone else with the "expertise" can help your friend with those.\n\n* So get your friend to see a therapist, therapists are great \^_\^\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat can you do for your ENFP, well that is to help encourage your ENFP friend to do more Si and Te tasks.\n\nThese two books are good for learning more about Si for your ENFP\n\n* https://www.amazon.com/Was-That-Really-Me-Personality/dp/0891061703\n\n* https://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-ENFP-Survival-Guide-ebook/dp/B012DP87ZO\n\nAll the while encouraging your ENFP to try new things, to develop new talents, to try new opportunities and these new things, these new opportunities are what will increase the Te of your ENFP.  These things will make an ENFP feel more confident.\n\n* Te makes an ENFP feel confident.\n\n* Si is self regulatory energy that helps an ENFP not get in the funk in the first place but also to battle the funk in a pivot matter once engaged\n\n * These two things work in a complimentary manner much like how humans use both the left and right hand in a more efficient way than using only one hand.  They do different things but they help each other.\n\n* Therapist to help ENFP with other things, things involving subdued / shadow functions.  It is not your job to help your ENFP with these things and these things very much do improve but they improve over long space and time^(via learned experience that is integrated) and trying to increase these things in the short term requires an "expert."\n\n
2	I think this sounds like poor mental health and low self-esteem in general, although being particularly concerned with the self could be Fi-related (xxFPs)\n\nIt sounds like she could benefit from therapy, meds, etc. if she hasn‚Äôt started these things already\n\nSource: Have an anxiety disorder and on meds
2	Me. But it is and has been a work in progress for many years now. About a year ago I was urged by my family to see a psychiatrist and a therapist. Even though I was reluctant at first, it was a great decision. I‚Äôve been taking small steps to get where I wanna be(just mentally stable and presentable, for now) and I‚Äôm relieved I can focus on developing my hobbies(which I hope to turn to a career). Yeah, I still suffer from the anxiety of underperforming but at least now I have the energy to continue developing. I recommend your friend find a therapist. One of the things that helps the most in therapy it just being able to spew and bounce ideas around, and to have those ideas sorted by a professional in a healthy dynamic. I wish your friend the best. :)
4	Would a shy ENFP test as an INFP	I can‚Äôt decide if I am INFP or ENFP. Took the test when I was younger and got INFP. Took it now and got ENFP. Now I am less shy than I used to be, but I do still like my alone time, so I really don‚Äôt know which one I am. I overthink a lot, but I do secretly quite like attention even though I pretend I don‚Äôt. Though sometimes I prefer to blend in. I like deep meaningful conversations but also like joking around. So what am I?  
7	>Would a shy ENFP test as an INFP self\n\nSometimes, there are no good MBTI / Socionics tests, there are just adequate and really bad ones.\n\nTests can't really determine your MBTI this is an idea that Jung had, tests are merely imperfect instruments and they can help some people with introspection.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLearning more about the 8 cognitive functions which MBTI is based around of.\n\nNow lets look at the 8 function order for ENFP and INFP\n\n* ENFPs are (Ne-Fi) + (Te+Si) // Shadow also called Subdued Functions of (Ni+Fe) + (Ti+Se)\n\n* INFPs are (Fi+Ne) + (Si+Te) // Shadow also called Subdued Functions of (Fe+Ni) + (Se+Ti)\n\nNotice the order of the 8 functions with ENFP and INFP are merely switching the order of 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6, and 7 and 8.  In many ways ENFPs and INFPs are the most similar types between ENFP and the 14 other types.  (15 being INFP, and 16 being its own type the ENFP.)  Same thing applies with INFPs with ENFPs being the most similar of the two types besides another person of its own type.\n\nAnd now you see one of the flaws with MBTI tests (there are many of them) sometimes they suck at figuring out whether you are an introvert or extrovert for we all have introvert and extrovert energies and thus we are all ambiverts **in reality** but we are introverts or extroverts **in preference / we prefer a certain arrousal / interaction pattern.**\n\n* Furthermore of the 8 Extrovert types, ENFPs are the most ambivert of the 8 E types, and if I recall from memory correctly a similar thing happens with INFPs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis article helps explain the difference real well between an ENFP and INFP.\n\nhttps://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/09/523471/
3	ENFPs see the possibilities first. They act on their ideas and then judge whether they should continue. INFPs will only act on something once they know they should and only begin to consider possibilities on things they've already analysed. Basics of Ne-Fi VS Fi-Ne. \n\n\nMore info:\nhttps://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/12/how-each-cognitive-function-manifests-based-on-its-position-in-your-stacking/
2	i'm an ENFP, and I experience the same things as you. You don't have to be a paragon of extroversion in order to be an ENFP, it's essential to have time to recharge.
2	I‚Äôve only tested once as an INFP, but the profile descriptions really don‚Äôt fit my character. I‚Äôm an ENFP who‚Äôs just a little borderline on the I/E.  Definitely like spending time with other people, but I‚Äôd prefer them to be my kind of people and I don‚Äôt always have the courage to make a move to talk to others. Definitely like spending time on my own too. Simple as that.
1	Hey! Even though there are a few times when I get tested as INFP, I think ENFP was a more accurate reflection of who I am. I think knowing that my Ne is more dominant than my Fi, which is also pretty high, made me feel more inclined to relate with the ENFP personality much more than the INFP.
1	Yes, potentialy. I had Social Anxiety Disorder most of my life so I obviously would test as an I on tests. But I knew I liked people, I just couldn't be with them. The thing about tests is they are unreliable. You should study the cognitive functions and decide for yourself. Because INFP is not the introverted version of ENFP, they have their functions in different order and think differently. The E just means ENFP's top function is directed outward and wide, while the I means INFP's top function is directed inward and deep.\n\nCheck this site: https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/if-youre-confused-about-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-read-this-an-intro-to-cognitive-functions/\n\nThen this: https://www.typeinmind.com/nefi
380	Every time I try to explain something	
101	Tells a joke and starts laughing at own joke
56	The fucking apology at the end, always.
44	As someone in both camps (ENFP/ADHD), this is both funny and sad. 
22	Holy shit, so accurate
24	I can relate as an INFP but I usually don't tell the full story because nobody's interested XD
20	The prologue is a serious issue, because people think that's the story and start reacting to it. And then it goes like 'yes, but I wanted to say'  'oh you were not done' 'no' 
14	As an IT person I've found a niche where I run trainings more than others on my team. They are very happy with the arrangement. But I have to be aware of this flowchart in my own head, and I've found that taking the time to create a good set of visuals to accompany my presentations helps keep me in line.\n\nIn creating the visuals I've already taken the time, by myself, in my cube, to determine what needs to be said and what doesn't need to be said.\n\nThen, within that framework I have freedom to improvise in the moment, responding to queries from the audience or engaging them in creative ways to make the trainings personalized and maximally effective.\n\nIt's like musical forms: within a defined form the composer has a set of limits, and expresses their creativity within those limits to present a masterpiece of art.\n\nI haven't tried doing this with storytelling, but seeing this chart makes me want to try and see how narrative works using that framework method. 
16	I feel personally attacked
8	Is that not the right way to tell a story?
7	Ahahah totally me....Major side story then....wait, why Was i talking about this ? You said something..so there was a point to this...ah, yes, therefore...*conclusion*...\n\nDid it today ahah
3	[deleted]
4	Strangers edge away from the drunk mess telling story and oversharing* but return because your actually pretty damn funny 
2	I‚Äôm a pretty good story teller. Just know that you have these tendencies and counter them. Keep it brief. 
2	Absolutely what I do every single day. I even think in my head ‚Äúoh shit this going longer than I thought but I can‚Äôt stop here. ‚Äú
2	I read somewhere that ENFPs' stories lack of details. Do you think this is true? 
1	You just summarized my last post into a single picture Haha! üòÇ
1	This was me today actually
1	I once asked for adhd diagnosis, mostly for the adderal. Too bad I wasn't
1	This is the story of my life...when I tell it to other people. Damn you apology! Oh god, I'm sorry.
1	Doubly so when you have ADHD and are an ENFP. But it makes life entertaining. 
1	r/adhdstories
1	My INTP husband says my train of throught is like a Rube Goldberg machine... it's so true!
1	Same but my bonus is that i forgot what i was gonna firstly say and start telling different story and then I forgot again
1	This is any Ne user üòÇüòÇüòÇ (I actually saw the same meme in the ENTP sub a while back)
1	It's really comforting, knowing that I'm not alone with this struggle! So thanks for sharing it and ramble on - I guess :D
1	I love just watching ENFPs tell stories. It may take me a week to realise what they said but it's just they have so much passion and excitement in what they're saying that I can't help but smile.
1	What makes you in a horrible mood that is hard to come back from if any?	What makes you in a horrible mood that is hard to come back from? As in something that someone says or does once that can immediately tick you off and cause you to go into a depressive state? (Not really long term things but feel free to share if you want!)
2	Doesn ºt necessarily put me in a depressive state but people choosing to be ignorant will always make me really really sad lol
1	I have resting bitch face, and people automatically tell me to smile, and ask why I'm in a bad mood. Dude, it's just my face, I wasn't in a bad mood until you said it! 
1	Really just being in pain in general tends to suck any emotional fun I can have. I can't laugh at people's jokes and I have a much harder time just smiling at something 
1	When I‚Äôm excited about something and someone absentmindedly says something that shuts me down. They probably forget right away and it didn‚Äôt mean anything to them but it can bring me down for a looong time 
1	When people judge other people too quickly and/or negatively, ie say something mean about someone or groups of people when they don‚Äôt know them or what they‚Äôve been through 
1	Winter, specifically the last 2 weeka of December as well as the first week od January. Each time, without fail.
2	ENFP with amnesia	So I'm writing these character who has amnesia, remembers nothing about himself, but his personality is ENFP, how do you think an ENFP with amnesia would act like? 
2	They would probably derive their entire personality from their environment. Example; they wake up in their living room and piece together their personality from things around them like people, photos, toys, tools, weapons, books, posters, food in the fridge, sex toys, etc
1	I would search for albums, through the gallery in my phone (if I remember the code), examine every corner of my room and analyze my wardrobe. I would also try to find an agenda to call mutuals and/or try to search my name on the internet (in case I knew it). Oh! And also my computer/tablet, I would investigate everything in it.\n\nI would probably be freaking out in the beginning but I would end up feeling an intense curiosity. I wouldn't stop searching things that could give me clues (and I would probably cry in the beginning)
3	ENFP or INFP (or any other type)	 \n\nHi guys,\n\nso I've been studying MBTI and Jungian psychology for a while now and I'm stuck, since I can't determinate if I'm an INTP or INFP or any other type. I'm 17 years old guy, it that helps.\n\n* I'm pretty sure of the Ne-Si and I think that maybe I have stronger Si, in other words, I'm pretty nostalgic. It's one of the things, that makes me cry, besides relationships and really deep movies. I can recreate an older experience, or the feeling I got from it (mostly recreating dates with my ex in my head). Also under stress, or when I have to come up with a solution in a short time my mind switches to "come on! what have worked in the past? Think!". But at the same time I like change.\n* I tend to be idealistic, I have this dream in my mind, that sometime in future, everything will work out, and I'll have a stable job and a lovely family and it's a goal I want to accomplish. I've been told that I attract the most "autistic"(meant as an insult, not a diagnosis), flawed people around. Also, for idealism, for example, I like my school, my job, my boss and his attitude (he's a phlegmatic to heart), even though they have their flaws, I'm okay with them. And people around me constantly b\*tch about those things. Like yes, I too sometimes like to complain, but most of the time my mind is like "if you've chosen to do this, please suffer in silence". For example one night my friend from school was constatly complaining about our school and teachers, even those that are really great, and I didn't have any problem saying with a cold expression on my face, that if she cant handle it, she should quit and go study tailoring, but if she wants to do this, then she should just shut up and let it be. She was offended by it, very unexpectedly.\n* I hate overly emotional people that tend to cry after every slightest insult. Then I have the urge to apologize, and I dont like that. Also I cant stand people, who really forcefully try to be funny, but they just ain't. I cant stand them. And also stubborn close-minded people.\n* I'm pretty short-tempered, especially, when somebody micro-manages me, or speaks againts my way of doing things. I tend to explode, but I use to cool down in pretty short time and sometimes even regret it. Sometimes, when somebody really grinds my gears, I tend to explode and say every reason why he's horrible and stupid. Sometimes I do it I regret that, sometimes I do, I'm proud of it, but it happens like once every 2 years or so.\n* I've been told, that I have the ability to make people talk about things, that really matter for them, even complete strangers crack opened in front of me, but then I dont know how to emotionally support them, I'm not empathetic. Most of the time, if they open up while messaging, I tend to write a really long message, covered in beautiful words, that offers a solution. But when they come to me again and again and again with the same exact problem, I dont have anything new to say to them, because my last solution is, in my view, still great.\n* But this applies only when Im dealing with other people's feelings. When I deal with mine I tend to be an emotional mess. I've found out that writing poems and essays about the person tends to really help me, and when I've shown them to my friends, they didn't believe that I have written that, because in their eyes it was really great and romantic and stuff like that.\n* I'm a really romantic person and I think it's because in my early teen years, my mother forced me to watch romantic movies with her every weekend, until I started to enjoy it. And my soul animal is probably a crying teenage girl.\n* I tend to go out of my way to help others most of the time. I even remember learning how to control a completely new program, while I was going to town to meet my friends, and at the same time explaining how to control it to my other friend on my phone, since she couldn't understand it (and use google properly for that matter, but it doesnt matter, I liked to offer her help)\n* I've been told that Im overly critical about other people, but cant handle critisism myself, but I dont think thats true.\n* Sometimes people ask me why I'm so negative, but most of the time, Im just discussing every possibility, and they've just heard the most horrible one. I call it realism.\n* I tend to brag about things.\n* I'm a meme-lover, day-dreamer, tend to miss details in the physical world around me and value alone time as much as time spend with others and have tend to not miss social gatherings.\n* I'm perfectionist, highly critical towards myself, and always have been straight-A student, because learning came always natural for me. I also don't have any problem cheating on the test in order to get the best results, even though I see cheating just as a backup plan.\n* I can't hide any of my emotions, when I'm flirting I'm the last person that realizes it and I dont have any problem opening up to a complete stranger.\n* I'm either talkative and expressive as hell (which happens most of the time, especially around my friends) or I'm reserved and quiet.\n* I'm accidentaly rude to authorities and waitresses.\n* I can seem to be pretty insensitive. For example, when I was on a school trip to Auschwitz, after the tour, most of the people were moved and silent. But me? I was deciding what Im going to eat, while I was thinking about every innapropriate joke about jews. Yeah, I was moved too, and the things nazis have done were horrible, but my reaction to deal with serious topics, unless its talking about relationship, is to make fun of them. I think of it as some sort of defense mechanism.\n* Most of the time I have a problem keeping secrets. I either dont realize it was a secret and even if I do and I really try to keep it, it somehow slips out of my mouth in some cue.\n* When I start explaining something, I use my whole body to do it. I'm a visual thinker, my mind tends to thing about everything: concepts, math problems, etc. in images, and using my hands helps me to describe it.\n* I like to be the grey mouse, in clothing, in music style (for example I have a "socially-acceptable" playlist, to which I don't listen to) and in many other different things and I want to be liked.\n* When I want to buy new cloth, I tend to sends pictures of it to my friends in order for them to choose what suits me the best, since I cant decide this myself.\n* I have this friend of mine, that's like the complete opposite of me in his opinions, and we use to argue about everything and that's probably the thing, that our friendship is built on. Most of the time it's really fun, but when we go on a week trip together somewhere, at the end of it, when Im really tired, I tend to shout on him something like "why cant u just be normal" when he still tries to disagree on everything. He is somewhat used to it and accepts it. I sometimes say a ridiculous idea to him, that we start to discussing it, which goes like me: \*says idea\* ... yes, but....yes, but...yes, but...fine, you are right. And because of that some people make fun of me, since they think that I agree with him on everything.\n* I dont have problem meeting new people. I tend to fit everywhere and nowhere at the same time, but I really wouldn't say that I'm popular. In new groups, I use to find someone, to whom Ill be his companion. Most of the time its somebody, who made the first move, since I'm somehow too shy for that and its something I want to change about myself.\n* I somehow have the ability to synchronize with person. For example, even though me and my best friend are not the same, we have the same though proceses, same taste in woman and design. We didnt have that before and our attitudes are completely different. We are in a bromance, I think.\n* I know a heck lot of people, but my circle of friends is really, really small. I dont burn the bridges with other people, I just forget to maintain them. My thought process is like "okay, so because u havent contacted me in the first place, I dont want to bother you."\n* I'm the extrovert of the introverts and the introvert of the extroverts. If I have the feeling, that my point of view will be listened too, I dont have any problem expressing it or lead the conversation, and most of the time I'm the loudest one around. But when I'm in a different setting of people, I can be really quiet, tend to just sit and listen to them for hours at a time, without saying much.\n* Im judgemental about people even though I dont want to, but most of the time I create my opinion about somebody (like hes a musician, hes a technician and that person is a sportsman) from just looking at them or speaking to them for few minutes. Im wrong sometimes, but Im right most of the time. I thought most people do this, but then I found out, that for some, it isnt natural at all.\n* I feel like I'm a walking contradiction. I'm working as a swimming instructor, love playing violin, writes poems, love technology, is good at maths, loves fantasy and video games, love talking about relationships (some friends of my make fun of this and say that Im a woman, because there are "sparks inside my eyes" every time someone starts discussing relationships), works with design and our schools yearbook, newly like psychology (I was obsessivly researching about it for past two months) and I kinda want to see how it all works out.\n* I'm really good with kids, and I have been working with them for past 4 years. I would probably study pedagogy, but in my country that job is poorly paid, so I'm going to study informatics, because much better paid and I like it and understand it.\n* With everything I do, I tend to have a all-or-nothing attitude. For example I either binge-watch a TV series, or don't watch it at all. For me, to start something, most of the time, I need to have the mood to finish it right here and there, or I won't even start\n* I really suck at arguing, since I tend to speak before I think and then somehow contradict myself in every other sentence and cant back my opinions, which in my view contradicts with this ENTP sterotype. And arguing with my ex was like saying a statement, then apologizing for it. I was like a puppy. Until I got really mad about her and cut her out of my life. I still have feelings for her, but in order to secure myself, I just dont want her in my life at all.\n* I'm indecisive and second-guess all my choices and its the other reason, why some of my friends say that Im a woman\n* Most of the time in order to fully understand something, I tend to study about it, understand it with my own logic, then discuss it with somebody in order for my logic to be fixed by the other person's point of view.\n* I don't think of myself as creative. When I paint, I like to capture reality or re-paint, copy, someone else's work. I dont come up with new ways and methods to do something. Most of the time, when Im presented to a system I tend to augment it in my own way that I thing is the best, but it really isnt a new way, just slightly different. And when I come with something like this, I always stick to it. For example, I used to submit a laboratory report (describing the experiment) every month, and I used to do it in the exaxt same way - the method, font, etc for three years.\n* I use to create my own routine and way of doing things and I somehow like it this way. For example Im eating the same musli with milk for breakfast for past 6 years or I created my own way of teaching kids swimming, augmenting things I've learned on a course, and I think that its pretty routine work now, but it still isnt, cause every kid does different set of mistakes and u have to adjust it to them. Like the scheme is pretty much the same, or the exercices, but u still adjust it and correct different mistakes on every child. I most of the time tend to be strict, in order for kids to improve, but I dont have any problem playing stupid games with them and actually enjoy it.\n* I think that Im a bad person, full of flaws, but I kinda like it, since at least my life is interesting this way. Also I want to fix them.\n* I've been tested for ADHD, since our school psychologist thought I have it, but negatively\n* I have written this in one session\n\nI would really apreciate your help, because I can easily manipulate most of the MBTI test, so I cant trust them, and on the 16personalities test, which is completely wrong in my view, because it measures the letters, not cognitive functions. I've got 50% on almost every letter. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese are my results if that helps in some way or the other:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMBTI test:\n\n* E/I depends on mood, with preference for I, most of the time, around 60%\n* N over S 80%\n* T over F at around 50-55%\n* P over J at around 60-65%. When I 've first done MBTI test I've scored highly on J, because I always keep a mental schedule inside my head and like to plan some things ahead. But I've realized that when I plan something, most of the time I fail misserably to actuay follow the plan, also have no problem spontaneously adjust my schedule and hate detail-planned trips.\n\nCognitive Functions test\n\n* Ne and Si, pretty sure about them, Ne being stronger than Si\n* Te preference\n* The Fe/Fi is slightly complicated. I think that I have just under developed Fi, since I'm still in my teenage years, but on things that I have an opinion, I have a pretty strong one.\n\nThanks for your help, I apreciate, if you have read everything I had written.\n\nSorry for my english
2	To be honest you sound nothing like an ENFP or INFP. You actually sound exactly like my girlfriend, an ENTJ: Judgy, impatient, like to help people but not if they keep being idiots, can't hide or control emotions, describes self as a "realist," says things without realizing it will offend someone (very un-ENFP as we naturally walk in anyone's shoes and see things from every perspective so we always know how we'd feel in any situation), hate emotional people, short-temper, good communicator, criticize others but can't handle criticism, always think they're right, negative, brags about stuff, rude without realizing it, not colorful clothes, care about money more than passions.\n\nAlso the part about not being creative and not thinking up new methods or ways to do something is so un-ENFP it is literally our antithesis. But the way you describe augmenting a system to the best way for you sounds very Te, all about efficiency. The things you said about needing others' opinions on things like clothes (very Fe) and being very indecisive sounds like an inferior Fi thing like ENTJ too or a Fe thing, needing others approval/opinion because you can't figure out your own. As an ENFP I generally always know my opinion. That's what strong Fi is all about. So I don't think you are INFP either or ENFP.\n\nGiven your results ENTJ follows too. J is not necessarily about planning, it just means your top extroverted function is a J and I think for you it is Te. You have all the classic signs from what I can see. So either ENTJ or INTJ. Though you may be an ISTJ or ESTJ which would mean you have the same functions as ENFP/INFP but reversed orders which could make sense. Tests are very unreliable. Studying the cognitive functions is a much better way. I think you've done that some already but I still recommend this site for the best cognitive function-based descriptions of types:\n\nhttps://www.typeinmind.com/teni/\n\nhttps://www.typeinmind.com/nite/\n\nhttps://www.typeinmind.com/tesi/\n\nhttps://www.typeinmind.com/site/
2	Is this ENFP making fun of me?	This male ENFP in his late 30s is acting strange. He's always hugging me when we meet, he tells me he is so happy to see me, he told me I look good and we should get in touch. I called him, he seemed so happy and thankful that I did. I could hear him smiling on the phone. Asked him if he wants to meet up and talk he immediately said yes, he'd really like that. He told me he lost my number when he changed his phone, was thankful that I called him and that he has my number again. Thanked me basically a million times. When we ended the conversation he once again said that he'd love to meet me and talk about how we've both been. But he told me that he'll ask me out when he gets back (he got back today) because that's how it's supposed to be - a guy should be the one asking out. He was lauging nervously when he said this. I said ok but then realized that it sounded like a date. When I asked him if he wants to meet up, I thought as old "friends". Ok great. But he didn't call today and I'm wondering if he is just making fun of me? Instead of rejecting me, he's keeping me hanging. And maybe the thing with "the guy is supposed to be the one who's asking out" was a way of him laughing at me for even asking him. He was posting on social media a lot today...\n\nWe have a past. He used to be my private teacher, would flirt with me a lot. Ended badly. Didn't talk for more than a year. What I don't get is why keep hugging me after everything, tell me he's happy to see me (suddenly... after blocking me and not talking to me), tell me I look good etc when he knows he hurt me a lot!!! This is not being nice, it's being cruel. I think he should be old enough to realize what these compliments and glimpses of hope do to someone who's been in love with him. I never do that, I put clear boundries. \n\nI don't get if he's struggling with rejecting me and instead trying to act fake nice? Or does he still like me but is being a coward? When I talk to him, I always get a feeling that he does like me. 
6	Scared to blow it so accidentally blows it. Classic enfp story. 
5	Sounds like he likes you a lot. Given your history that adds layers more to his nervousness. Give him some time. I don't think he's making fun of you. I don't know an ENFP who would do that.
5	Ask yourself this...if it‚Äôs this hard now, what makes you think it will get easier? Relationships only get more challenging as new layers are introduced, not easier. This isn‚Äôt to say they aren‚Äôt worthwhile, because my god, the right one is worth all of it.  \n\nI struggled with a lot of self worth questions in my dating life, so I get that.  But honestly, this back and forth is just not worth the effort in the end. You can‚Äôt make the world turn on your own will.  Just be straightforward and tell yourself what you want out of a relationship...what you REALLY want.  It‚Äôs probably something like security, compassion, love, care, attention, etc. Read the Five Love Languages book to get a better idea, but after you have done some soul searching...ask yourself if this type of relationship is what you really want. Hot, cold, ignores your calls or texts, makes you feel crazy...I imagine that‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre going for.  \n\nOnce you feel like you know what it is you are truly wanting, ask yourself if you get that from this guy. It‚Äôs just part of getting through your mid twenties though.  I‚Äôm in my early 30s now, but I met my wife at 28 years old and we just hit our first anniversary. I promise, when you find the person who is worth all your effort, it won‚Äôt feel so difficult to get all of theirs!  Good luck!
2	>I think he should be old enough to realize what these compliments and glimpses of hope do to someone who's been in love with him. \n\nNo. That's unfair and that's playing games.  Yes, us ENFPs flirt a lot but we WANT you to be overwhelmingly blunt. Everyone responds to us but not usually in a serious manner. He doesn't know what you want and you're expecting him to guess?\n\nIf you want him, don't play mind games. Men and ENFPs particularly HATE mind games. Expecting him to pick up on magical unclear signals is a mind game. Just put it all out there. Any ENFP will appreciate that. 
1	He didn't contact me yesterday. And I tried to call today but he rejected my call. Maybe he doesn't know how to tell me he doesn't want to see me? I shouldn't have called. :( I feel rejected all over again. I don't understand why is he telling me how happy he is to see me, that he'd like to meet me but then completely ignore me and push me away. The only explenation I can think of is that he's just laughing at me. The other one is that he was expecting me to text before that date and when I didn't, he decided he's done. I don't get it. It's always been like this. We get closer and then he pushes me away. And I feel like he's setting up these all or nothing situations and if I don't do something correctly, he ignores me. \n\nWhat should I do now? Leave it? I feel like he's not going to talk to me again. \nMaybe he tested me if I could just let him be the one asking me out? But we agreed upon a date and then he didn't contact me. \n\nCould it be that he's afraid of rejecting me and wants to be nice? But this way he is actually hurting me way more? Is it common for ENFPs?
2	Any fellow ENFP losing interest in people crushing on you?	
7	Happens pretty much every time someone catches the feels. I love a little unannounced/very subtle sexual tension but once someone loses control of that and starts to let their feelings bleed in a more-serious-than-playful way then I'm waaay outta there. I don't need that kind of mess or to feel guilty for someone wanting something from me I can't give. \n\nAmusingly, I married the first guy I met who was sort of "cold" in response to me (who was also interesting and talented). It was so affronting and confusing that I had to stick with him and find out wtf was up (and win him over to my side to prove to myself how awesome I am, obviously).  :P\n\n(side note to people who may be in love with ENFPs and reading these threads for tips: you can't feign that kind of INTJ aloofness and please don't try - we can generally tell when we're being gamed and if you had a chance, it will be gone once you try to manipulate us. be yourself and if it's meant to be, it will be - I left my INTJ and broke his heart before I realized how precious he was to me and came grovelling back)
2	ENFP with CPTSD not thriving	Hello you beautiful people. \nI need help figuring some stuff out.\nBasically, [26F] ENFP who spent all teenage years exploring the physical and metaphysical worlds via copious substance use. During that time I was in a very mentally abusive relationship, lost all of my friends and was diagnosed with CPTSD. I've been working to gain my former lively self back for about 6  years to no avail. I've made a lot of friends within our quadra and so I see them when mutual interests arise, but keeping up with each other naturally tapers off without offence. Due to my CPTSD I spend a lot of my days depersonalizing inside my mind  and trying to pull out via internet searching. I cant remember what I used to like, I havent felt passionate in ages. I'm returning to school (online) to fill up some of my time, but I want to thrive again. I want to enjoy novelty and experience again. \nHave any of you found yourselves in long ruts inside of the house? How did you find yourself again? \nI live in a political city, so there isnt much to do outside of going to the movies, clubs, and shopping.. none of these things interest me at all. I live for the ideational conversations I have with friends when I do see them, but as it stands I feel no meaning or purpose in my life and so initiating plans has felt impossible. When I try to figure out a process for self growth (school, doctors, self care etc) I get so overwhelmed with all of the possibilities, I never actually narrow anything down. Please halp me, share your secrets !\nXoxo
3	Posts some wikipedia not to just be rout, but instead posting some useful stuff and then I want you and me (or you and other people reading this thread) **to talk about it** and what these words mean to you.\n\n>Herman proposed that recovery from C-PTSD occurs in three stages:\n\n* 1) establishing safety,\n\n* 2) remembrance and mourning for what was lost,\n\n* 3) reconnecting with community and more broadly, society.\n\n>Herman believes recovery can only occur within a healing relationship and only if the survivor is empowered by that relationship. This healing relationship need not be romantic or sexual in the colloquial sense of "relationship", however, and can also include relationships with friends, co-workers, one's relatives or children, and the therapeutic relationship.\n\nPosts some more.\n\n>Complex trauma means complex reactions and this leads to complex treatments. Hence, treatment for C-PTSD requires a multi-modal approach.[12] It has been suggested that treatment for C-PTSD should differ from treatment for PTSD by focusing on problems that cause more functional impairment than the PTSD symptoms. These problems include emotional dysregulation, dissociation, and interpersonal problems.[21] Six suggested core components of complex trauma treatment include:[12]\n\n>* 1) Safety\n\n>* 2) Self-regulation\n\n>* 3) Self-reflective information processing\n\n>* 4) Traumatic experiences integration\n\n>* 5) Relational engagement\n\n>* 6) Positive affect enhancement\n\n>The above components can be conceptualized as a model with three phases. Every case will not be the same, but one can expect the first phase to consist of teaching adequate coping strategies and addressing safety concerns. The next phase would focus on decreasing avoidance of traumatic stimuli and applying coping skills learned in phase one. The care provider may also begin challenging assumptions about the trauma and introducing alternative narratives about the trauma. The final phase would consist of solidifying what has previously been learned and transferring these strategies to future stressful events.[42]\n\nTo me this is Zone of Proximal Development, sometimes called educational scaffolding.  It was first proposed by Lev Vygotsky one of the great psychologists that was foundational to psychology roughly 100 years ago (about the time of Jung and Freud but a completely different group of people he was around.)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development\n\nThe ZPD is about establishing an environment and support but not too much support (a goldilocks principle) where you get a combination of structured learning and unstructured learning.  When people think unstructured learning think Montessori  education (you know those elementary schools where children have goals but they are encouraged to do free play and so on.)   Structured learning is giving corrective feedback both with rewards but also advice on how to "tighten" up your skills on how to do it slightly better.   Well ZPD is all about combining both structured learning and unstructured learning till you master a skill and you need less support.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt is about creating engaging environments that are with feedback, and reward, and low stress and what stress is there is slight arousal but never should the person with CPTSD ever feel unsafe for that causes hypervigilance and hypervigilance turns off the learning, turns off creating new experiences and integrating them.  Hypervigilance and vigilance is very much different things.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervigilance\n\nHypervigilance besides stopping learning also causes exhaustion, learned helplessness, and more intense sensory and emotional / limbic feedback.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSpeaking as a person with his own hypervigilance problems, hypervigilance ***SUCKS!!!***
2	First do you have Borderline Personality Disorder with your CPTSD or just CPTSD by itself?  (Some people have both and some only have one not the other.)
2	Although the decicion to buy a pet should never come lightly, having a pet really helps me to have a purpose in life and even some fun when I'm alone.. I'm not suggesting some really intensive pet like a puppy, but maybe a small pet (like a hamster) is something to consider? Just make sure you do plenty of research so you can give your new family member a great life :)
10	Cognitive Dissonance	Do any of you struggle with cognitive dissonance? If so, in what ways, how has it affected your life, and what did you do to align yourself again?\n\nA lot of aspects of my life are very inconsistent and it usually boils down to thoughts contradicting themselves, thoughts not matching emotions, very temporary beliefs, and lack of direction. I‚Äôm sad to say that this has even led me to question my identity sometimes.\n\nI actually know more INTJ‚Äôs and INFJ‚Äôs than I do ENFP‚Äôs in real life despite the rarity of them and so I thought I‚Äôd reach out to maybe obtain a perspective from somebody with a similar framework. Thank you.
2	All humans experience Cognitive Dissonance friend :)\n\nI‚Äôd look deeper into where the dissonance lies, it is a barometer and it‚Äôs telling you something. If you can find out what that thing is and make changes over time, you might experience less of it. 
9	Memory problems?	Have you ever had that situation where u dont wanna forget a memory, but u slowly realize day by day that u are forgetting it, and not matter how hard u try, that memory is fading, to a point if there were no photographs of it u wouldnt even bloody remember?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Its even more frustrating when you remember everything preceding and succeeding the memory, but not the memory itself)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr is it just me? :P
2	Keep a journal :) 
2	Personally, I‚Äôd check out r/nootropics, make more use of the note app on your phone, and look into neurofeedback if you can afford it - these have all been game-changers for me
2	My memory in general is just pure garbage 
10	how do ENFP's behave when they are attracted to someone?	
19	Shit the bed usually lol\n\nIf they're more mature then they'll be more obvious about it and confident. Good eye contact will be there. We try to convey our feelings with eye contact or at least I do. \n\nIf I'm in a group of people and I'm attracted to someone in the group, I won't be able to get as absorbed in conversation with others as much as usual and will probably glance over unless I'm determined not to do so. Then again if the conversation really interests me I can get into it, but the point is the person will be on my mind a lot in the moment
11	Might also depend if we are friends, if not then I might look over with minimal subtlety üòÇ just because I'll be wanting to soak in the beauty of the other person for a few seconds if I really like em. Maybe that's just me though 
7	Depends on the situation. If the person is single, compatible and potentially interested, I am likely to just tell them I like them and may ask them out - but I often feel shy so I do it through a text or online message, rather than face to face. If it's someone who isn't single/compatible/interested then I tend to avoid showing it, but sometimes I can't help flirting a little bit with the person.
3	Mostly teasing comments\n\nTry and spend more time with them and just generally be around them more
2	Depending on who they are and how I know them. If they're my coworker I usually just ignore them and somehow I lose interest when they start talking to me. And now lately, if I like them I tell them straight away and they have been running away from me. Lol. I have a pretty strong personality so when I do like something I go straight for it.
2	tease n flirt
2	probably would try to act chill and normal, talk and continue the conversation u know,  but gosh secretly shy and scared lollllll and would like to have a blanket to hold when we face you. 
1	so.. a few hours ago she posted on instagram a pic of herself: a part of her shoulder is revealed and i noticed a hickey there. im so disappointed. a friend told me that it could be make up but I'm not quite sure. maybe it's an older pic. whatever, i kinda lost my hopes. and no, i wont ask her about it.\n\n\none day i was chatting with her about the marks that I've left on my ex bf (which was one year ago..) and how the next day i covered them with foundation in the girls' bathroom :)))))))))) +another day i was talking to her and i noticed a small redish mark behind her ear and asked if it's a hickey and she said that it's probably a pimple or her cat scratched her. i was a little bit worried and she probably observed that. i dont know what to do...
1	Awkward affff
5	So about Fi	How did y'all figure out your values and make your decisions? I feel so conflicted about so many of them, and it's all messed up. Since I feel messed up it messes with my decision making and it feels like every decision is a bad one. Does anyone have trouble with feeling out your decisions and riding your authentic zone?\n\nCause right now my current leading solution is to go trip on LSD in the woods and confront myself.
1	Can you give an example of something you're conflicted about?
23	Match on Tinder asked me to draw her cat so here it is x)	
6	That is a fat but contented cat.
1	Why is there a black line in the middle of the belly
1	But did you smash?
325	It be like that sometimes	
66	Sometimes I like yo mix it up. Isolate myself FOR attention. Spoiler: this does not work.
30	We have seperate selves with seperate interests, im just beginning to understand this, taking a high level mastercourse on life-productivity with neurolinguistic programming and other stuff incorporated.  \n\n\nThe problem apparently is that these seperate selves dont have any agreement... so you binge out in this other side of you that ignores the side of you that wants to do better.  \n\n\nWhen you go for therapy, the problem isn't you, the problem is the you which isn't there, the alcoholic is hiding within you (example using alcohol) the alcoholic side of you is the one needing therapy, and you are this other version of yourself.  \n\n\nIts about finding mutual interest between these sides of yourself so they can agree - or something, im barely starting on this chapter about it...
16	The unhealthy way to accomplish this is by doing everything alone while chatting to people all the time.
2	I have the same but I'm an ENFJ.\n\nFor me it feels like just not having enough energy and because of that needing to isolate (so not because I necessarily want, although that too at times), because I suck at evaluating my energy reservers correctly and end up giving too much or just overworking or something. Not having enough left for myself or not given me enough attention the way I need\n\nMaybe its something everybody does but we ENFs just perceive it & name it the same?
2	OH MY GOD WHY IS THIS SO TRUE
2	When I was depressed I would isolate myself as a way of seeing who really cared and would reach out to me. That doesn‚Äôt work very well though since I tend to be the initiator, and that‚Äôs not a bad thing!
2	I‚Äôve only just come to the realisation that almost always - like, 95% of the time - I‚Äôm the one who initiates contact, communication etc. \n\nAnd this need for attention (or is just a basic desire for connection?) is often ignored or bypassed by others. \n\nWhich then makes me feel not acknowledged or valued. Which in turn triggers a kind of negative reaction of ‚ÄòWell, sod off then you lot!‚Äô And I then retreat or hide from others üôÅ
1	This picture speaks to me on a very deep level. 
1	The perfect crossover doesn't exi.....\n\nYep it doesn't exist
33	Anybody else open like a thousand tabs, and then forget about them?	Like you keep seeing something interesting "oh I'll check this out later" and open it in a new tab, and all of a sudden you a have thousand open tabs
10	I reached the max amount of tabs on my safari just the other night. On my phone though if it makes any difference. 
4	Yes I have at least 20 open at all times üòÜ
4	I just bookmark everything. I'll check it later. Maybe. I have like 10,000 bookmarks. No joke.
3	At all times, in both Chrome and Safari. And the browser crashes and I get panicky that I can‚Äôt find those sites (that were soooo important that I abandoned them for weeks or months) while simultaneously feeling relief that I can start fresh. \n\n
2	Not just a bunch of tabs, but also extra safesearch windows on my PC for googling things I don't need anyone to know about - and then I end up leaving them open on my PC until it magically shuts itself down in a week or two. :') 
2	I finally found out what happens after I have more than 99 tabs open on my phone's browser, it shows a :D, in the tab count. \nBut yesterday I decided to reboot my laptop, and normally my browser on there has a restore previous session option, well not this time. All my tabs gone. \n
2	This post let‚Äôs me know I‚Äôm home lol
2	I just deleted 15,000 screenshots I‚Äôve saved in my phone. Random stuff I found interesting, intriguing and important. As my New Year‚Äôs resolution- I deleted them all as I think that is a sign of being a hoarder. lol
1	Yep. I always have at least 30 especially if I‚Äôm doing a school assignment 
1	currently 52. I just need them all!
1	My phone tabs need about one minute to all load when it crashes once again. I think it must be about 700. There are tabs from early 2017.
1	Metaphor for my life 
1	4500 on firefox, 600 on opera
1	I love how true this is! That's why I use Vivaldi as my browser. After hunting the perfect browser for almost half my life, (I'll never forgive Firefox for getting rid of Tab Stacks) Vivaldi filled all my needs.\n\nIt allows for great tab management through the side bar. Also, the history function is robust so I know if I close a tab it won't be too hard to find again.\n\nhttps://vivaldi.com\n\nNow all they need is a phone app that allows me to sync my phone history. \n\n
24	Music is life	Am I the only ENFP who finds no purpose in doing mundane routine stuff like shower or cleaning if there is no right musics playing in the background? I cant even start the day if I havent find the right musics to listen to. I feel like its gonna be boring and as an ENFP, i hate boring stuff!
5	You're far from alone. Things I *need* to do feel like chores without music. But with music then I'm being productive while enjoying myself. 
5	I have more wireless speakers and headphones than I can count and I‚Äôm every room of my apartment. Even my shower speaker is a waterproof speaker that sticks to the wall so I can control my music without bringing my phone in. Always gotta find the song or album that fits the day and run with it. Don‚Äôt even use shuffle all that much these days.
5	The universe is sound at the end of the day. Those vibrations control and weave into the fabric of reality so it makes sense you feel more in tune and productive with music playing when you do these kinds of tasks. I myself am a slave to the rhythm. 
3	As a musician ENFP, can confirm. 
2	Umm I that‚Äôs like a foundational enfp thing is hatred of mundane things. I suggest audible it saved my life haha.
2	I make my own music. I sing everywhere. I would much rather sing in the shower than play music there.
2	i use my jbl flip speaker significantly more than my television. i love music so much. 
1	I find it literally impossible to clean my house unless I'm listening to music (particularly 90s rap and R&B). At night when I'm winding down I need something super chill like Radiohead or Damien Rice, in the car I need 70s rock. Yup, music is life 
1	Yes! 
2	enfp reacts to infj (best match for enfp imo)	
2	You should do an ESFP reaction! 
5	I think I have adult ADHD...	I hear this is common with Enfps? I dunno what to do. I literally can't even read books anymore because my attention span goes elsewhere. I'm constantly misplacing everything. I'm always planning this stuff I want to do and not following through with it. How do I even go about figuring this out? Do I talk to my regular Dr? What do they even do to figure out if you have it?
3	This is an extremely common misconception amongst Enfp's (creative personality types), as they tend to be restless, bustling with ideas and having difficult time putting into words what they are thinking as they tend to perceive stimuli more quickly than can be verbalized. I tend to forget things often and have difficulty concentrating too but there is a distinct threshold between that and a fully blown case of ADHD. Try searching ENFP vs ADHD and you'll find an amalgam of videos, trivia, and quizzes to help you understand how to distinguish the two cases.
2	Hi, I can relate :p altough it seems that your head is even more chaotic then mine is.. I function way better if I make lists about everything. It helps me to stay focussed and finish tasks. But if it's that bad that you can't read books anymore, talking to your doctor is a good first step. If they can diagnose you, you can be helped with therapy or even medication. 
1	Have you tried the Pomodoro time management system? It‚Äôs very simple. But, for me, very effective. Without it, I wouldn‚Äôt complete essays or get any reading/research done. 
1	I have ADHD, was diagnosed a few months ago at age 27.\n\nYou can ask your doctor about getting a psych eval with ADHD testing if you suspect you might have it. And yes, there are traits which are just personality, we ENFP tend to jump from one thing to another and be a little spazzy, but you find yourself forgetting things enough that it affects your life, cannot concentrate at work, or find yourself in severe trouble because of lack of impulse control, emotional regulation or not being able to do stuff despite consequences, then it might actually be a disorder. \n\nHow they go about testing for it differs from region to region. I'm in Canada and it took six months from referral by a doctor to proper diagnosis by a psychiatrist. There were sets of questions to identify the prevalence of symptoms and differentiate from other disorders which share characteristics (such as bipolar disorder), then a live discussion to contextualize the results.\n\nIf you want more info on what to expect, you might be interested in heading over to /r/ADHD. \nBut really... Just talk to your doctor. That's the logical first step and they know better than friendly strangers on the internet. :)
9	INFP wondering about ENFPs	Hello ENFPs!\n\nI'm an INFP(-A), and I'm just a bit curious to know what your take is on this. \n\nI have a few ENFP friends irl, and we're very similar (of course, minus the extroversion part). However, I've noticed that some of my ENFP friends tend to be... forgetful? Or scattered? They usually have a lot of interests, but sometimes lack the focus to just tackle one thing at a time. I suffer a bit from having multiple interests, but I feel like my introversion gives me focus, in an odd sort of way.\n\nIs this a common thing for ENFPs?
10	It‚Äôs common for Ne-doms (ENxPs) in general to be a bit scattered\n\nI tend to start many projects and only finish some of them, learn many things, visit as many places as I can, do things on a whim, etc.\n\nMy brain just feels all over the place most of the time
11	Interested in everything... satisfied by nothing. 
6	It's because ENFP's and INFP's have their functions in different order. INFP isn't just the introverted version of ENFP. They think differently. The E in ENFP just means our top function is directed outward and wide, while the I in INFP means your top function is directed inward and deep.\n\nINFP's lead with Introverted Feeling so for you refining things down deep, focusing one one or a few things is that you prefer most. You need everything to be personal to you or related to you or your values or emotions for you to consider it important or really worthwhile (or so I have heard from an INFP I talked to about our differences). ENFP's on the other hand lead with Extroverted Intuition. We see possibilities and pattern and ideas without restriction, ideas bouncing off ideas with no limits. INFP's also have Ne but only after it has passed Fi, thus very much limited in scope compared to what we experience. And likewise we have Fi but only after Ne. So we can be interested in basically everything, it doesn't have to have anything to do with us. It can be silly, or "random" to others but makes perfect sense to us. Everything is connected.\n\nWe can focus on one thing but only after we have explored all the possibilities.
4	Yes. We are like this....
2	Lol yup, lots of interests but little focus. Actually tested ENFP in high school but tested INFP the past couple of times ive done it (22M). Personally trying to narrow down my interests and focus more on one or a few areas rather than bounce around as much. The bouncing is great but the looseness has gotten to me in a bad way to a degree. My dad seems ENFP and continues to be bubbly and scattered but gets along, so its a path many people choose to take and embrace ^^ your ENFP friends most likely love you for your deep diving into subjects :)
2	Ya it takes some real discipline to follow through when the novelty of something new fizzles out. 
2	It's very common with me. I also think I have undiagnosed ADHD though. My best friend is INFP
2	I think it's pretty common. I'm super scattered. But I also have ADHD, so I'm not sure if it's from that or if it's my personality.
8	How do you guys feel when you see someone isn't fulfilling the potential you think they have?	Do you pity them? 
8	it upsets me but I let them live their lives. Because I know that if the change isnt made by their own choice and inner motivation, its just spending time for nothing
6	In my opinion, there‚Äôs no such thing as measurable potential. I used to believe in it, but I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that it was just my own arrogance. The idea that people can be better than they are is flawed in that there are reasons why people are who they are. Major life events shape who we are and who we will be, and we ENFP tend to not really realize that we don‚Äôt really end up having enough information about people‚Äôs lives to accurately gauge who their supposed best self is. In reality, everyone is their best self. In reality, there is nothing to feel about‚Äîexcept our own narcissism.
6	I used to worry but overtime learned to trust people go at their pace and choose according to their needs and I have no authority nor the full understanding to impart judgment regarding how FAR they could and should go. Respect and move on. 
3	Not pity. I feel a need to help and encourage.
3	It's upsetting but it solidifies my determination.
2	Frustrated because it‚Äôs usually the mirror, even though I‚Äôve accomplished a lot my ego demands the validation of a movie star.
2	I can get down with that in a sense.  I‚Äôd say that ‚Äòcurrent potential‚Äô isn‚Äôt a thing but I do think people still inherently have ‚Äòpotential‚Äô.  That‚Äôs to say a person should maintain hope of a better possible future, even if currently they are where they are.  Tomorrow they could get their act together, and work toward improvement.  That improvement isn‚Äôt always objective, but a heroin addict can always become more, for example.\n\nI‚Äôm currently trying to quit smoking cigarettes, and have had to confront the fact that I use it as a crutch when I feel overwhelmed/overstimulated.  In a lot of ways my inability to work through my overactive mind is me not living up to my potential.  The part that makes me waffle is when I realize and acknowledge I could be more/do more I instantly increase my potential.\n\nI feel for your long day.  I hope this is coherent because I just woke up on an airport bench with about 3 hours of sleep.  Here‚Äôs to almost being home, and to catching up on sleep.  Cheers!
1	Why would I pity them? And what business is it of mine what their potential is or whether or not they are living up to it? Everyone's on their own path, it's not for me to say where they should be. 
1	I wouldn't pity I'd try and encourage them

2	Any one here from salt lake?	Every time I talk to someone online or listen to someone who is an enfp I get so excited and happy to find people so much like myself. \n\nSo I decided to take a chance to see if anyone here is from Salt Lake City, UT. The reasoning is to meet up and be friends. It's so lonely out there for an ENFP, I would love to meet someone who is as passionate and interested in things. I just feel it would help me become inspired for my stuff as Well.\n\nThanks in advanced.
1	Holy shit, I am from Salt Lake! Which part of the city?
1	No, but I go there sometimes!
1	I‚Äôm from salt lake!! Downtown! 
16	Watching the Office reruns and crying...	Holy cow guys. I've seen those Michael Scott memes get upvoted and I was always like "what are those guys on r/enfp smoking? Michael Scott isn't ENFP!"\n\nAny time I've seen the Office I've always thought that I relate to Pam, from me being like maybe a Scranton 7 in looks  (okay fine, a Scranton 6) and being artistic and all that...\n\nBut I was talking to someone tonight as you do and mentioning how I don't need to use toilet paper because I'm so cool like that... and then he ghosted and HOLY HECK WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?!!\n\nI'm Michael Scott. I say unintentionally cringe things all the time and I don't even realize it. And I'm so starved for attention that I just blurt out my stupid thoughts to everyone within a distance no matter how bad they are because I have zero filter.\n\nI seriously just cried in the shower because WHY AM I LIKE I AM?!!\n\nWhy won't people love me? Is it because I'm say awkward cringe stuff about my boobs or how I can do weird things like it's boasting or my history of stupidity because somehow I view doing moronic things like a badge. \n\nI love me. Why won't other people love me? And why do I even care if people love me because I'm clearly satisfied with myself and don't need validation from people.\n\nBut why do they all ghost?!! Aren't I pretty? I mean I'm no insta model but I'm regular girl pretty right? I'm not even insecure so I don't know why it's bothering me.\n\nFinally I get it. I get caught up in some fantasy of every potential suitor that comes my way JUST LIKE MICHAEL SCOTT... even though most of the time its so far out of the realm of likelihood that I am even liked by said person I'm attracted to this week.\n\nSo I admit it now. I'm some kind of female Michael Scott who scares everyone away because when I think I'm being funny, everyone else looks on with pity. But I'll go out and I'll do it all again the next day because I like myself too much to change... so why won't they like meeeeeee?!!!\n\nSo I'm off to watch Office reruns and accept that maybe I'm cringe but if Michael Scott can find love despite the cringe, maybe there's hope for all of us.\n\n(oh my gosh this entire post belongs in r/sadcringe. WHY AM I THE WAY THAT I AM?!!)
7	This is wonderful!!!! I like the ENFP cringe /shrug
3	I've seen cringier stuff.\n\nI can relate to you. Just a male version. The only way I see girls not being fallen in love with is when they are a bit over the top funny. Nobody loves the clown. I have been living proof before and I can see it in others. They Just seem to try to hard in any possible way. Always have to talk, Always have to make jokes, always make time for the crush, and adapt to everything they do or say. This effect is amplified for guys because they must extinguish every sign of neediness while it can be considered cute for girls, but that does not change that too much is too much. \n\nI don't even know if you are a case of what I'm talking about but I cannot imagine a average+ girl not finding herself in something romantic unless they fuck up. It's cool to be a little weird or quirky, but being normal (chill you version) instead of putting on a show goes a long way. We like to be an open book and honest with our feelings and letting them out, but matter of fact: being mysterious is a thing. I am turned off by girls that seem desperate, and that they do by talking too much/being too funny/being too clingy etc.\n\n You probably wouldn't fall for such male either. Perhaps you even had the chance multiple times and rejected him for one of those reasons without being able to pinpoint what it is; "what is wrong with me??" He just is too needy.\n\nAnd here I find myself realizing I have solely been speculating all the way along, having no idea if this even applies to you, but eh, don't wanna delete and maybe it helps.
2	None of this sounds cringe to me. If a girl said she didn't need to use toilet paper I'd say "Great! Think of the savings!" That guy who ghosted is an asshole. Anyone who ghosts is an asshole actually, it's a despicable practice. Casper was not friendly at all!\n\nI personally don't believe in cringe, or corny, or any of those other things. Different folks like different strokes. One man's cringe is another man's cream. Er, you know what I mean.\n\nCrying in the shower is useful as it adds more water to wash you. But you shouldn't. Not everyone is gonna love you. It's something I've had to learn to my amazement. But fuck em. If they can't see the greatness in you then they're not the one. That's ok. There are plenty of men in the sea, especially around New York City though they seem awfully stiff (in a bad/dead way).\n\nI'm sure you are pretty. I'm sure you are a Scranton 7. You don't need others' validation to know your worth. Most people are boring, dumb fuddy duddies. Don't worry what they like. Because it's probably something boring and I wouldn't want to be it.
2	I ghost wrote this wtf
1	I feel like its the unfortunate issue of being such a unique individual in a society and culture that encourages and supports the exact opposite, I personally could not contain my laughter when I read that because I could tell you don't literally mean what you said but said it because its entertaining but most people you're gonna meet just won't have the functions to meet you there. I hope you guys keep being you so when I do meet someone like you I get to enjoy all of it and not another cookie cutter human. 
1	Elaborate on the toilet paper thing ü§®\n\n(Also i relate except i say cringey shit intentionally)
1	>I don't need to use toilet paper \n\nAs someone who has IBS, consider me officially jealous.\n\n>stuff about my boobs\n\nI'm listening. Go on...\n\n>Aren't I pretty? \n\nUnknown. Pics?\n\n...Wait....I may have missed the point of the rant...
1	That‚Äôs what she said
1	Yeah I definitely think we are Michael Scott. But I think it‚Äôs a spectrum... when I was younger I was embarrassingly unaware of how I looked to others and prided myself on being so boldly ME! I loved attention, even awkward attention, made stupid jokes and comments. I saw it as well at least I‚Äôm not a coward! I‚Äôll be authentic no matter how others think! As I‚Äôve matured I realize not everybody wants to be authentic and original or even thinks that those are important- and I can understand and even value that perspective. I know that I am a magical unique quirky person but I don‚Äôt have to blast it out all the time just to prove it. I also really value being out of the spotlight, and communicating more fact based things Ive learned instead of jokes, and being more serious and reserved. I know that‚Äôs not my natural state, but as I get older the more I respect these opposite ways of being and incorporate them successfully. I think the unfortunate thing about Michael Scott is he is so hungry to be loved and doesn‚Äôt foster respect from others. I‚Äôve seen that pattern play out in my own life- it‚Äôs not enough to let your freak flag fly, I‚Äôve had to learn to sit quietly with myself and love myself- the boring, forget-able, un-unique parts included. It is very difficult, and has been a long struggle to truly love myself, and find certainty and stability and satisfaction inside instead of from other people because I LOVE other people so much. I think ENFPs love people more than anybody. Blessing and a curse!
1	I am 1000% Michael Scott.  It‚Äôs ok, as you said, you still love you. Your person will come. Mine did and they are chilllllllll and awesome and hot and like all of my bad jokes, it‚Äôs rad. You might as well just accept that you are intense and zany, and that there will be many highs and lows for you, and that as long as you realize these bad moments will pass away and leave yourself some excitement for the future and patience for the current moment you‚Äôll end up alright. Obviously you can also learn from your experiences too and make whatever changes you see fit, but we all know that changing our entire personality isn‚Äôt going to work, nor is that what we even want to do! Also I think it‚Äôs hilarious that you said you are too cool to use toilet paper (I assume it was just a hilariously bad joke?) I live in India half the year and nobody uses it, they all use bidets and they think Americans are totally gross for only using paper (they will say omg if you got shit on your hand would you just wipe it with paper or wash it üò±)  I‚Äôm not cool and I use both. Anyway, keep your head up, who  ghosts someone over a bad joke, probably someone who is not very funny themselves, or also they were grossed out but whatever, find someone else who you can make embarrassing jokes with who will still like you anyway, like a good friend. You deserve that. I never ever thought I would find it and went through like 90 million experiences just like that, but when I finally found my person it‚Äôs like SHOCKINGLY good, unquestionably just very very very good, and I wish the same for you. I had resigned myself to just possibly dating off and on forever and maybe I would never find that person, and was ok with it because I had other goals (ok with it, not in love with the idea though) so dont worry too much and I wish the same for you! You‚Äôre ok and it‚Äôs ok to be sad and embarrassed about it right now too, but just keep loving yourself and pursue your dreams and consider whether you even care at all about using less potty humor in the future lol. 
1	I completely getcha
1	Please don't give up hope! You're just waiting for the Holly to your Michael. The people who ghost are jerks and are just getting out of the way so you can find the one :)
5	Is this an ENFP thing? People always want to do things for me ... and it leads to bad places	I think it's because they respect/value me, want to be friends with me, and in its most harmless form I end up making lots of friends on whom I can call for favours (and I strive to pay them back or be available to them when they need help). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn its most insidious form, friends become so close to me, offer me so much emotional support (and I offer them the same... but often the conversation comes back to me, because I'm usually initiating), that it can become suffocating. In the case of one very close INFP friend, very recently, he ended up developing feelings for me, not putting in place the right boundaries to keep our relationship healthy, and now we're taking a break from each other. I end up bringing out codependency issues. I take advantage of their kindness. I become an emotional vampire. This may be due to how I was raised, by an overbearing, oversupportive Iranian mother who wouldn't even let me wash my own clothes when I was in the house. She wanted to do everything for me.  \n\n\nI'm not sure if this is an ENFP thing. Maybe it's an example of how our type can be emotionally manipulative. But I don't know how to stop.\n\n&#x200B;
2	If you don't mind me asking, how old are you? I used to be an extremely manipulative individual, but as I got older, experienced, and matured I grew out of it.
1	I find the opposite to be true for myself unfortunately. It's very draining you know?
1	I had a similar but opposite thing happen also with an INFP friend. I'm a good listener and he had a really messed up childhood, so I listened to his problems and he ended up falling in love with me, which I really didn't want (I always end up listening to others because I don't feel comfortable sharing about myself, even as the one who usually initiates). I had to distance myself and eventually cut him off altogether because he just became far too smothering and codependent, even after I told him I wasn't interested and never would be. \n\nNot cause he's not a good person who I genuinely liked, but because I could recognize how unhealthy he is and didn't want to be involved. He is def physically attractive but takes terrible care of himself and completely lacks a spine, which was really difficult for me to respect. He needed to grow up and I wasn't about to be a crutch for him. 
15	Is this an ENFP thing or is it just me?	
5	Meh, I'd rather call it a "depression-thing". Not like I can't relate, but I know too many ENFPs that wouldn't.
3	Mood swings	Don't you guys love them and hate them, I was feeling very down but all of a sudden I got this air of optimism and now I feel great! But it sucks when it's the other way around. To older enfps: does it ever stop? And it's not like I want it to stop, I live the positive energy and... I do enjoy the melancholy somehow... is that weird? 
6	Yes and then you can listen to sad songs to try and slip a bit deeper into it and enjoy the superior feeling that no one knows the depth of  your human. But it‚Äôs ok because you enjoy it you also feel like you control it so it‚Äôs not really that bad. As highly emotionally sensitive people it‚Äôs enjoyable to experience the spectrum of emotion as they come.
3	I'm 34. It's better than say my teen years and my twenties but it hasn't stopped
2	It never stops. Just accept it and it will be better 
6	WhatsApp group for All MBTI Types	Greetings, wonderful ENFPs!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe, along with an ENFP and an ENTP have created a pretty cool Whatsapp group. It's a very active group and it's super fun! Everyone is hilarious and very friendly. It's equal number Feelers/Thinkers. We lucked out with a very interesting people's community and on this New Year, we invite everyone to join this lovely community of like minded people :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://chat.whatsapp.com/Ey15CEhWJag1Q1sstl8IrA](https://chat.whatsapp.com/Ey15CEhWJag1Q1sstl8IrA)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: If you're unable to add yourself (Apple users?), PM me your number and I will add you :)
8	How do I not be afraid of heartbreak?	Or not let it effect my mindset when in relationships.\nRecently getting back with an ex, one of the few girls I‚Äôve liked this much. We have a good connection but in the back of my head I can‚Äôt help but think of a potential breakup even when everything‚Äôs going great. I‚Äôm terrified of heartbreak. 
5	Read Daring Greatly by Brene Brown- or look up her Ted Talks. It‚Äôs all about remaining courageous and open hearted in the face of the possibility of hurt and how that is true strength! \n\nBut also keep in mind perhaps you are paranoid about things because there are signs that there are problems- first of which being this relationship already didn‚Äôt work before. Be careful of trying to force something to work simply because you want it to and not on its own merit. I am totally guilty of this. It is hard to know when you love someone if the relationship is actually depressing you and making you anxious. If it is, you can be guaranteed you can find a better one.  The love we feel for those close to us come from US it is OURS, not theirs. Those amazing feelings are something you make! And you can feel them with a vast number of people on this planet. I say this as someone who has been through some hard hard stuff, many times over. \n\nI hope you find the quickest path to your best life and love! Courage :) 
3	Heartbreak is a potential risk of any relationship. But no risk no reward. Think of it this way, you can either be alone your whole life but free of heartbreak (though loneliness is its own kind of heartbreak) or you can potentially find love and happiness but maybe risk heartbreak. Maybe. I like those odds. Better to play the game and risk losing rather than forfeiting the game and making yourself lose.
13	Anyone else ever wish they could be more selfish?	About a thousand times recently I‚Äôve caught myself thinking ‚ÄúI wish I was more selfish‚Äù or ‚ÄúI wish I got angrier and yelled more often‚Äù. \n\nIt‚Äôs weird to confess that. I‚Äôm a classic ENFP in the sense that I‚Äôm very emotionally intelligent and cannot bear to see the sight of someone in pain without helping as much as I can. But a lot of times that ends with me being used, taken for granted, and generally feeling burnt and horribly tired. I don‚Äôt avoid conflict by any means but I will usually shove my feelings down deep and just have a rational and calm discussion with whoever hurt me, leading them to believe that I wasn‚Äôt that hurt by what they did, when in reality, I‚Äôm deeply in pain.\n\nI look at people who are less focused on how other people feel, and I‚Äôm jealous, because other people know exactly how they feel when they are hurt. If someone hurts them, they fly into a rage and yell. And yeah, it‚Äôs bad, but at least it‚Äôs obvious how hurt they were. I feel like I constantly put other people‚Äôs feelings above my own, and then get hurt when they don‚Äôt do the same for me! 
4	I can totally relate to this! Someone will hurt me but because I can understand why they did it I cant stay mad usually even though I'm hurt. 
1	Yes! I know exactly what you mean. For me the solution has been to allow myself to feel ‚Äúnegative‚Äù emotions. I often repress them (my first impulse) because I know these emotions make others feel bad and cause strife. So I used to pretty much leave those emotions ignored, unresolved. The problem is, when you do this, your emotions don‚Äôt really go away. You can forget about them but sooner or later... you have repressed anger symptoms that can come out as addictions or bad habits or self destructive activities. You cry for no reason... or you blow up when you can‚Äôt take it anymore. I realized I often was miss Calm and Placid in all sorts of situations I didn‚Äôt like only to totally and utterly collapse and blow up everything- permanently- later. And I‚Äôd do all this without losing my temper! üòÜ I realized you actually have a responsibility to others to let them know how they made you feel if they crossed one of your boundaries. To smooth it over like nothing is wrong is not just bad for you, it‚Äôs unfair to the other person who will no doubt sooner or later suffer consequences from making you feel less than great without actually knowing it and getting a chance to change their behavior. It‚Äôs a form of vulnerability to share when something made you angry or upset. And admitting that we feel these things can be embarrassing- it means you are hurt-able, like we all are. \n\nSo now, I am ‚Äúselfish‚Äù but I wouldn‚Äôt call it that because I actually very much dislike to have to tell someone my negative emotions they have caused me. I share with them (after I have processed and explored my emotions privately) how what they did effected me  in a calm way, and I take full responsibility for my emotions. But I let them know how what they did made me feel. I apologize sometimes that I am angry with them about it and recognize the anger is from my own sensitivity due to past experiences... etc. the result has been pretty great because most of the time the person who upset me doesn‚Äôt want me to feel upset and they acknowledge how they can be more mindful of my feelings and we both end up feeling a lot closer in our relationship. Obviously with some people you would keep it more simple or draw a boundary without going into your own psychology about it. I found articles on how to create boundaries in relationships very helpful. Such an important skill in all areas of life that never came naturally to me because I want to love and include everyone all the time! But if you do this without understanding and enforcing your own personal boundaries... you won‚Äôt be very happy. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned in this regard, anyhow. :)
47	Paralysis by Analysis.	Hey\n\nI am not entirely sure, if this just a mental thing, or actually true.\n\nI often feel like I am wasting my time. I am angry at myself for not spending my time more productively, like on a hobby or university. \n\nEven though I feel this frustration, I often don't start doing things. \n\nAnd to make in even more confusing, I am not necessarily a passive person. I think compared to how the average human lives their life, I still do quite a lot, but in my mind never enough.\n\nSo when is enough enough? How can I be at peace with myself in this sense.\n\nI am often accused by my mother of living in fantasy, sometimes I am not sure anymore who to belief, me or her. \n\nA friend also observed I am often stuck in thought. According to her, a lot of my problems are imagined. Hence the title, which is a direct quote from her. \n\nIs this in any way relatable? What could help?
14	When i get paralyzed by thought, its usually because I know what i want to do but i feel like im not allowed to do it, or because i am too scared. Do you have any dormant desires you dont admit to people? Even yourself?
10	I have heard these claims by others as well. Really try to pay attention and stay in the moment, I have developed the habit of snapping my fingers to remind myself to stay here and not get lost in thought. In the movie The Secret Life of Walter Mitty he too gets lost in his fantasies, but fixes it by staying grounded through action in our shared reality. Watch the movie if you have the time. Study up on mindfulness, and focus on interacting with the outside world through your physical self. 
8	I am similar to this. I analyze myself into a hole that is impossible to escape. You should look into mindfulness & meditation--two great ways to focus on the now instead of imagined possibilities
4	I recently read a book called 5 seconds rule. Helped a lot. Basically making decisions must swift, else you will think yourself out of it. Thinking generate stress and doubt. When you want to do something, do so without thinking. For example, approaching a cute girl üòè
3	Very articulate post, and I can say with absolute certainty that you're not alone. This frustration you speak of is something I have dealt with as well.. these vast amount of thoughts/options that go through your head in a sort of looping effect. All of which have pros and cons but no clear winners and so a decision becomes difficult to choose if not impossible sometimes. Personally I have more hobbies than I can count but this frustration comes when thinking about changing careers or if I should relocate. Everything is just so interesting so instead of choosing something new, one seems just sit idly by in deep thought weighing the options.   \n\n\nLastly, when you said 'in your mind never enough' and 'how can I be at peace with myself'; I understand what your going through and I think listening to others who have commented on this thread is important, which is to be mindful and meditate. I've been using these techniques a bit over that past year through headspace and believe it or not it can really help centre yourself and relax that inner energy that is telling you what you're doing is not enough and  to pursue more.  \n\n\nAs an ENFP it sometimes feels like our focus is scattered beyond repair through a web of thought and options.. but it also means we aren't settling and as a result we can accomplish very interesting and unique things. But interestingly, the most recent advice I read was that it is wise for ENFP's to pick a path and stick to it..    Hope this helps you realize you're not alone.  All the best
2	For me (May or may not apply to you) I always felt like I could do ANYTHING but the thought of giving my 100% to ONE THING and being ‚Äúit‚Äù was too scary a commitment to me. What if I get locked in to this path and I can‚Äôt change my mind because I‚Äôve invested too much? What if this ends up defining me more than I want it to? These thoughts stopped me from achieving and investing in myself. The comfort of having a lot of options open created a life with less achievement because I was ‚Äúa mile wide and an inch deep‚Äù. For me, I‚Äôve had to realize that submission to a few particular talents or goals is NOT limiting and is not something to fear. That I can still feel freedom even when devoting myself deeply to something and that it‚Äôs ok to not be the best at something or perfect. The things that have stuck with me the longest that I‚Äôve become adept at are the things I loved so much achievement and perfection did not matter. \n\nA general recommendation I‚Äôd give you even if my story doesn‚Äôt describe you is to check out ego development of the ENFP. It has a set of difficulties our type goes through as we age and what we need to learn to become more balanced harmonious people.
2	I understand. I often can't be comfortable doing something because I think of everything else I could be doing. But it is a sign you are not being in the moment. You should check out some Mindfulness techniques and meditation. These things ground you in the moment and allow your mind to be more focused. One easy technique which I use (because of my anxiety) is called 5-4-3-2-1.\n\nLook around and really notice 5 things around you you can see. You may be surprised.\n\nThen notice 4 things you can touch around you or you feel at that moment, even your clothes on your skin, or the chair under you.\n\nThen notice 3 things you can hear.\n\nThen 2 things you can smell.\n\nThen 1 thing you can taste.\n\nYou'll be amazed after doing this simple thing how drastically the world around you suddenly looks. It brings you from your thoughts to the present in a crazy way.\n\nAnother thing is gratefulness. If you can learn to be truly grateful for what you have now in your life. You can have dreams and things you want to do and be but that doesn't mean you can't be happy and content in the present too. It doesn't have to be mutually exclusive. You can be happy now and happy later. Why wait to be happy?
1	Well, i didnt understand well what u said, principally because english is hard sometimes to me, but if that is the point. It's totally normal to sometimes a human completely stop what he's doing to be immobile and wondering about things, i usually that. Principally when i wake up, if that's the problem dw everyone does that
1	I can relate
1	I don't usually get paralyzed by thought, but I feel very related to this.\n\nI'm always thinking that I'm loosing my time, that I could be even MORE productive, when I'm actually in my limits. I always end up trying to do way more than what I can handle. More things for university, more extra classes, more chores at home, and I end up so exhausted. I need to learn how to manage my time, I'm going nuts. I do so many things... but at the same time, I feel bad if I don't do those things. I feel like I'm not doing enough, like I'm wasting time I could be using to improve. I ask myself the same thing: when is it enough? how can I stop trying to do everything?\n\nPeople tell me to get things more calmed, but when I do it they call me lazy or get me stressed telling me all the things I should be doing.\n\nI'm a bit lost in this madness and I don't know what to do.
3	How do others deal with this?	A few months ago I was diagnosed with depression after a few major things happened. I lost my first girlfriend, my classes at college were the most challenging they'd ever been, I started a new difficult tech support job and I was having a lot of issues with friends at school. It all came collapsing down around me and I didn't handle stuff the best because it was really my first time dealing with a lot of this. Getting past that stuff has been impossible and I've only been making things worse for myself by letting me talk down to and hate myself for a few months straight. In fact, two weeks ago I was diagnosed with a pretty severe case of Social Anxiety. I'm constant on edge that I might be hurting someone's feelings or that I might be judged for my depression or my other issues and have been stressing myself out for a long time. I don't really know how to get past this slump that I'm in and I don't want to turn to antidepressants right now. Is there any solutions that me or my therapist might not be thinking of? Mostly she's saying talk therapy and antidepressants help with both of my current issues. I'm in talk therapy, but again I'm not really looking to take antidepressants right now. I have a big fear of if I can't be happy on my own what's the point of living and a strange issue being unable to swallow pills that I can't get over.
2	I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this. I have struggled with depression and anxiety. Everyone‚Äôs story is different but I am currently panic attack and depression free, I‚Äôm the most stable centered at peace and happy I‚Äôve ever been in my life- so I believe you can get here too! Life just sucks sometimes, to put it simply. Less than great things happen and it can drag you down so far from where you know you should be. Then you make decisions from your bad place, and that usually takes you to more not great places. You start to believe this is just who you are now.... you start to see no end in sight. But it is there. I promise you! The big game changers for me were talk therapy (with a GOOD therapist, mine was trained in psychodynamics and motivational psychology among other things, and was an ENFP) and slowly building a support network I could rely on (I had none) of friends and family. I had to repair some relationships, end others, and forge brand new. Having people you can trust is HUGE. I refused to take any prescriptions. Some other things that helped were:\n\n-keeping a routine. Go to bed and get up same time each day no matter what. I hate routines. Routines are death! But... they help.\n\n-exercise or do something physical that you‚Äôre BAD at. Yep! Never lifted weights? Dancing make you feel like a pathetic loser? Force yourself to do something that you can‚Äôt take yourself so seriously with because you are so ridiculous at it. It‚Äôs extremely therapeutic for me because I let go of my inner critic and get those endorphins from activity and learn that hey- I can improve! I‚Äôm never going to be a dancer, or a weight lifting pro but embracing my own suckiness and doing it anyway just for the sake of doing it was such freedom to my soul. Still is. \n\n- validate yourself. It‚Äôs ok to be depressed for a while. It‚Äôs ok to be sad. And anyone in your situation would be! You‚Äôre not broken. Your brain is telling you to make some big changes, that‚Äôs all. And you keep trying and looking at ways to be healthier and happier, you‚Äôre exactly where you need to be. And when you look back on this time, you will be glad you went through it.\n\n-confide in people. For me it was my new friend and my brother. They were not sharing their personal stuff with me- but so started opening up to them and they reciprocated. It was a great relief on hard days to be able to call and vent, and to hear empathy from them. \n\n- read books/articles on how to fix what you want to change in your life. Is often google search about dealing with the issues that were making me depressed or anxious and read how other people handled them. It took me all over the place. Psychology today, Ted talks, Buddhism articles... it became a huge resource of ideas which I could then bounce off my therapist. \n\nHang in there. Life is so hard. It‚Äôs freaking unbelievable! Sometimes I wonder how I‚Äôm even alive all the crap I‚Äôve been through. But life is those peaks, those valleys, those plateaus... as we go up and down, each time we get a little better at surfing it without getting stuck. That‚Äôs how I look back on my past struggles- I was building the valuable muscle to weather future storms without it shaking me anymore.  Feel free to DM if you need a friend! 
1	I have struggled with social anxiety and depression most of my life. I understand not wanting to try medication. But you have to understand, mental illness is an illness. If you were sick with a cold you would take medicine right? This is no different. Don't let the stigma associated with mental illness and medication cause you to suffer more.\n\nOther than that if you can find a copy of Feeling Good by David D. Burns I highly recommend it. It talks about actually helping you over your depression. It has real practical things to do, exercises and tools to use that really work great. It's crazy how simple things can help but he knows his stuff.
4	Any other ENFPs surprised to find out their type?	I was very quiet and shy in school (although once I got home, I was very talkative), and usually had only one or two good friends at a time.  I always considered myself an introvert.  But I‚Äôve taken numerous versions of the Myers Briggs test recently and every time test as ENFP (or sometimes XNFP).  \n\nSome people who knew me growing up but haven‚Äôt seen me in awhile don‚Äôt believe that I test as an extravert.  I was always the one people would tell to ‚Äúnot be so quiet/shy‚Äù or ‚Äúcome out of my shell‚Äù.  I knew a guy in my college days, though, who once told me I was the ‚Äúmost sociable introvert he‚Äôd ever met.‚Äù  \n\nMy sister tells me I match more the ENFP description than the INFP to her.  She says I remind her of Jo March (who was always my idol and who I wanted to be).  I‚Äôve read that she is an ENFP character.  I tend to be more quiet around loud people, so they tend to think I‚Äôm an introvert, but I‚Äôm very talkative around quieter types and tend to tease them a lot and joke around and get them to laugh.  They see me as very outgoing. \n\nI began getting treatment for depression several years ago, and just a few years ago I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder.  Now that I‚Äôm getting effective treatment for those, I feel much more relaxed in my own skin and am fairly outgoing compared to how I used to be.  People who know me now would never know I am naturally shy.  One guy at work told me that for someone who is shy, I must be putting on ‚Äúthe performance of a lifetime.‚Äù\n\nAt this point, I don‚Äôt often know a stranger.  I will talk to pretty much anyone, and I love working in teams at work or school.  However, I am still not very loud, and don‚Äôt often hang out in large groups outside of those places.  I have never been the life of the party.  I spend quite a bit of time absorbed in my own research and projects.  I need that time, but at the same time, whenever I am alone for too long I start to get kind of dark and have to get back around other people to lighten my mood and get back to normal.  I‚Äôm pretty sure if I worked from home, I would become very depressed.\n\nHave any other ENFPs had these experiences?  I‚Äôm still having a hard time accepting this.  Even on my most misanthropic days, though, I still test as ENFP.  
5	Well I think it comes down to the stereotype of ENFP's which is far from reality. We are stereotyped as crazy, bonkers, wild random unicorns. But in reality we are the most introverted extrovert. We can be extroverted and fun sometimes but we also need a lot of alone time, maybe more than some introverts. We can be a people person for a day or a few days then we might hide in our room and be alone for like a week, watching our favorite stuff, reading about new things, learning, processing what we did and experienced, etc.\n\nThe E in ENFP just means our first function is extroverted. Extroverted Intuition. But extroverted meant something different to Carl Jung than what we traditionally think. To him extroverted meant directed outward and wide. While introverted means directed inward and deep. So the E just means our intuition is directed outward, rather than inward toward us, and is wide and expansive, rather than deep and refining. So you can be an ENFP and be very quiet, the quiet observer. That is what I often am.\n\nIf you want to study more about functions check this: https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/if-youre-confused-about-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-read-this-an-intro-to-cognitive-functions/\n\nThen this to read a very good cognitive function description of ENFP's: https://www.typeinmind.com/nefi
2	I've taken the test at least 10 times because of the whole extrovert aspect. I've heard though that enfps are the most "introverted" extroverts and that makes sense. When I'm around people I know well I'm super extroverted but if I've just met someone? I'm really quiet. I remember when I was about 13 I went to Boston for the summer with my best friend and we stayed at her aunts house. This one night (after we'd been there a few weeks) we went out to dinner and I was being sorta an obnoxious goofball and her aunt said to me, "when you first got here I thought you were so shy and you have proved me 100% WRONG!" üòÇ I think a lot of us are this way. 
2	I thought I was an INFP for a long time because I can be very shy. 
1	Yep! I retake the test ALL the time. I have accepted it and can see my ENFPness most of the time but some days/ periods in my life I have sworn I‚Äôm an I or a T. When I‚Äôm depressed I switch to I. Keep in mind too it‚Äôs possible you take on shadow type characteristics when you are not healthy. I‚Äôm not super knowledgeable in this but I believe ENFP shadow type is ISTJ. You might still test ENFP but *feel* more ISTJ due to your struggles. Then there‚Äôs ENFP ego development where you take on inferior traits in a healthy way to become a more balanced person!

6	I am an INTP (28M) and I need some advices on how to treat my ENFP (25F) girlfriend o.o	Hello ENFP people.\n\nMy situation is that, as an usual nerdy INTP, I guess I am having trouble with connecting with people's feelings.\n\nMy girlfriend sometimes says I am too distant, and that I do not express very much that I like her. These issues occasionally rise up between us, and I think they affect her very much.\n\nWe usually talk about a wide range of stuff. It's great to figure the world out and reflect about things with her. I enjoy very much the sex, because we like to do similar things on bed.\n\nI think about buying her presents and taking her to different places (like concerts, museums and restaurants) to show that I like her. I try to send her different good night and good morning messages to keep things dynamic.\n\nBut I think I might be forgetting to do some important stuff that ends up firing these tensions between us from time to time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan you guys and girls please give me some tips on things I should do? Things to talk with her? I love her, and I want to make her happy, and keep our relationship healthy and pleasurable for both of us.
6	Why not just tell her why you love her more regularly? Just point out the stuff she does that makes you happy day to day, spend more time together, that stuff.
6	Find out her love language. \nTry this project for 1 month. Spread out show your love by:\n- words\n- physical contact \n- gifts \n- time spent doing something for her\n- getting out of your way to do what she wants. \n\nThen ask her what showed her that you love her most. Than implement that. \n\nBut there are always to sides. \nWomen will focus a lot more on negative emotion than good emotion . So you just have to tolerate a lot and just let her talk it out. Don't take everything to serious. 
4	Hug her from behind, kiss her forehead, be spontaneous in compliments (think human wholesome Twitter), keep it simple. Just appreciate her input. I mean if you like stuff she does you might as well tell her you do and she'll feel good about it too. Sure you may gift her small things, but keep it simple. Just some ideas.
3	DO. You say you THINK of doing this or that with her. Well, DO it. It will be hurtful if she finds out you only thought about doing x,y, and/or Z for and with her but decided not to. \nAs an INTP, you can live in your own mind. She can't live in your mind and must have real life experience. A lot of it. \nYou SAY you like the same bed-things. Make SURE of that by talking about it OUT of bed. ENFPs are eager to please and they try to win the affections of others, especially those who  put a barrier around their emotions. If she ONLY gets your affection in bed, you will damage her.  Everyone really does love the ENFP and they are often told that - so, if you don't show it and say it often - the way others do, you might as well break up now.  \n\nACTION is your only option.\n\nIf she is ALREADY saying that you are distant and don't ACT like you like her, then she is about halfway ready to leave you - or further. ENFPs patiently try to see the good in others for a long time before mentioning it and eventually giving up. If you have no commitment to her,  then she is probably close to leaving you with nothing but a missed opportunity to be built up and cheered for in all your endeavors. \n\nBuy her flowers, take her dancing, talk for hours,  hold her hand (in security, not necessarily a pda) - Basically, listen to Bruno Mars! (When I Was Your Man) Tell OTHERS how much you love her AND why. Do this in front of her and even when she isn't around. Not only does that re-inforce your feelings in your own mind and heart, it will Also get back to her. \nYes, she enjoys talking about a wide range of subjects. In a romantic relationship, she most WANTS you to talk about you: YOUR FEELINGS. Don't leave that to chance and circumstance. Say that you WANT to talk with her about you and schedule a time. Coffee? Divulge something about your past) childhood and how you think that has affected you now. Ask how she can help you grow, but don't ask her to divulge anything about herself. She will be so focused on helping you that it will renew her interest in you. She will make ways to cheer you on. Then, at some point tell her what you appreciated about how she handled your intimate discussion and then perhaps ask for 1 thing from her past that shaped her. Intimacy is what ENFPs crave. Emotional connection, not necessarily physical. \nKeep doing that, and you will have a lifelong cheerleader who will boost you up. But, if you don't want a lifelong partner, then please stop playing with ENFPs emotions just for the sex. Thank you .\n

2	I dont know if every ENFP but me personally I love little nice gifts, like my ex-boyfriend brought me the hazelnut he found in forest because he thought of me and he thought I would like it. Little, maybe not so significant things for others, which are uber-significant for me, like little nice rock, flower, anything stupid but interesting I might like but its uber-significant to me because its given to me just like that, that the guy thought of me and likes me or loves me and thought i might love the little thingy and he wants just make me happy with it.
2	Her love language may be words of confirmation.
2	Hey, it just sounds like you have different love languages. She prefers verbal acknowledgment while you are more a do things for someone/buy gifts person. It's ok, you both just need to talk about this and learn to understand how the other experiences love. Try to give what the other wants. So for you express your love in words more. It may be hard at first but practice makes perfect. And she will have to do more things for you/give you gits, etc. And You will both be happier. It's all about communication and knowing what each other want.
117	I lost my little sister yesterday	I feel safe here I guess. Just wanted to know y'all are here. I have an outpouring of support from friends and community but you people are like me, you know how deeply I am feeling this and that I feel the need to take care of others even in my grief. I'm not sure how to talk about it or process it and I'm not sure I ever will. I'm missing a piece of my soul now friends. Tell your loved ones how much they mean to you, how loved they are.
22	Hang in there. Speaking from experience, the pain you‚Äôre feeling now, the burden, it will get better. Things won‚Äôt be the same, but things will be better than they are now. You will be able to process this, you will be able to talk about this; as long as you give yourself the time you need. And remember, even though she isn‚Äôt with you anymore, what would your sister want for you?\n\nMake sure you talk to someone though, it could really help your heart mend. (May help them too)
13	i‚Äôm so sorry, love. it‚Äôs going to be hard but let yourself grieve. we enfp‚Äôs tend to shut off everyone in our despondency and for a period of time it‚Äôll help but know that we are never isolated or alone even at our lowest. sometimes talking it out makes me feel better, but you call the shots in whichever way helps you mourn better. this isn‚Äôt enfp related but a quote i really love, and has tided me through loss and longing is, ‚Äòthose we love never really leave us, they become ghosts inside of us and like this we keep them alive.‚Äô \n\nwrite, create art, cry, talk it out. let yourself feel. loss will be loss but the pain dulls with time and someday the only memories left are the wonderful ones. \n\nwishing you all the best. <3
9	Hi. My sister will have been dead 2 years at the end of this month. I know what you're going through. It does get much easier, but you'll think about her every day. Sometimes this results in laughter and happy nostalgia, and sometimes in total grief. \nOne of the hardest parts for me is the fact that other family members, particularly my mum, grieve very differently to how I do. I personally feel that as I could be dead tomorrow myself, I want to experience everything I can and be happy. I also have a very dark sense of humour, which I find helpful. This can look uncaring to people who see things differently. It's all about understanding that different thought processes are as valid as your own. All of my thoughts are with you. 
7	Take all the time you need to sort those emotions. From someone who had also lost their loved one, I agree with what others had said so far. Make sure you cry when you need to, to help you get those emotions out. Let me know if there's anything I can do to help out. Feel free to PM me.
6	I‚Äôm so sorry, that‚Äôs awful.\n\nMy only advice is to talk about her, over and over and over again, whenever you feel like it.\n\nI don‚Äôt think the grief will ever go away cause that‚Äôs the prize of loving someone. And that‚Äôs okay.
4	Im so sorry for your loss. Be strong.\n\nFortunately I havent experienced anything like this in my life, but one I can advise is - dont bottle your feelings. If you are feeling sad, just feel. Accept your emotions, learn from them, write about them to piece of paper or to document in PC. Just dont bottle. This is the only and the most simple way how to process it. \n\nSending hugs.
3	How incredibly sad. I‚Äôm so sorry to hear this. What can I do for you?
3	I'm so sorry for your loss. My sisters are very dear to me, too. I'd rather die than let any harm come to them. I feel you dude
2	I've Lost my Hero my Father almost 22 years ago and i still miss him so much. May he find Peace. \nI'm extremely close with my Mother and Siblings. Death is as natural as Life. Love them and ask for forgiveness when they are Alive. And Remember them in Death.
2	oh no feel so sorry for u, and here are some hugggsss :)))\n\nu know theres gonna be a bumpy road when u try to recover and wash away traumas, but try to stay positive, and listen to songs that heal ur wound, be surrounded with people who give u love and security. I've lose my very close friend, and really, do not try to find an explanation why she has to die and why some other people live longer, or why it happened etc, I tried for few years and still don't get the answer now, and thats just a loop for being depressed and anxious. and I guess it is really not a question we should look for explanation or answer. wish you the best and take care.
2	So sorry for your loss, friend. I can‚Äôt imagine what you‚Äôre going through, just know that you‚Äôll get through it. And as others have said, make sure you give yourself time to process your emotions, let yourself grieve and cry. Everyone around you is feeling the same way and it‚Äôll be hard because you want to care for them - just make sure you take care of yourself too. \n\nSending you all the love in the world. 
2	I know there isn't much I can say to make you feel better, but I can give you a long distance hug.\n\n((HUGS))\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss. XOXO
2	Hugs! We love you!!
2	Oh friend, I am so sorry :( I know nothing can ease the agony you are feeling right now but I‚Äôm sending you so many internet hugs. I‚Äôm proud of you for reaching out in some way. Allow yourself to grieve and go easy on yourself, it is okay to not be okay and survive in the best way you know possible. Sending you and your family so much love and healing thoughts. If you are ever in need of a stranger to listen, PM me anytime. 
2	Condolences. You are not alone in this hour
2	My condolences. There are no words for a loss like this. I wish you and your family much strength.
2	hopefully we can all take some of your pain from you as we read this.   just keep breathing deep breaths.  always come back to your breathing.  breathe in love and breathe out the pain.  stay the course.  üïâ‚òÆÔ∏è
2	Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you how to grieve, don‚Äôt worry about what you ‚Äúshould‚Äù do or feel or where you will be someday with your grief. For once in your life, don‚Äôt worry about analyzing it and just let yourself feel whatever it is that you need to feel. Don‚Äôt let the pressure of everyone telling you about their grief overwhelm your own journey. \n\nMuch love, friend. 
2	I would take charge of a part of your pain if I could. Sending all my support, long hugs and good, wonderful vibes. You will be fine, I promise.
2	Heartbreaking.  Holding back tears from your post. I am so so sorry for your loss. I am thankful for you being willing to remind us how important it is to appreciate our loved ones. Feel free to share any more thoughts or hard things with us here. We are here for you ‚ù§Ô∏è 
2	I'm so sorry for you.\n\nI haven't lost a sibling, but I remember 2 years ago when my parents called, asked if I was sitting down, and told me one of my oldest and dearest friends had died in a car wreck.\n\nWhat followed was a wonderful weekend of remembering, seeing old friends, reminiscing, sharing, ending with driving back home with my older brother (we live a 10 hour drive from our home town where our friend had still lived) singing our hearts out in the car to songs we grew to love when we were all young together with our friend.\n\nThe hardest thing was agonizing over whether what I felt like doing in my grief was the "right" thing to do, and then the relief as I realized it was perfectly OK to process my pain in those ways. Feeling numb is OK. Then feeling melancholy, and sad, and feeling the grief come and go, and remembering, and everything. It was all OK and good to go through. 
7	When do you get gas?	22/M ENFP. So my mom and I are both ENFP‚Äôs and we‚Äôre pretty different when it comes to filling up our tanks. I always fill mine up as soon as it hits empty or once it‚Äôs getting close so I know I have enough gas to get where I need to go. My mother, on the other hand, will drive forever on an empty tank. Curious to hear what other people‚Äôs tendencies are when it comes to this or if it just depends on the person!
15	Am I the only one that immediately thought op meant farting after only reading the title at first?
5	I always fill up at the halfway mark. Fuck having no gas. 
3	driving forever on empty tank is fun
3	When it hits empty haha
1	One needs to integrate your car's Si into your own Si =D \n\nI do not have a solution...maybe I do.  There are devices you can plug into the OBM port (I can't remember the exact name but it is the onboard diagnostic port all cars since the mid 90s have.)  And in many cars you can have it keep track of several sensors including if I understand it correctly the gas tank.  Well some of the devices you plug into these ports can be used for diagnostics while others can even send you text messages and so on via bluetooth.
1	I always fill the tank with around 1/4 left. My fuel gauge is weird and when it‚Äôs below a 1/4 tank the needle looks like it‚Äôs resting on E and my anxiety goes through the roof! I find myself constantly checking to see if the needle‚Äôs moved any lower until eventually I just say fuck this and fill up 
1	Between 1/4 and empty\n\nSimilar to when I charge my phone ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1	Between 0 and 20 miles, but I know that‚Äôs a bad idea 
1	I usually only go to a quarter tank left but I have gone down to only having 30-something miles left before. I like stopping at a certain point\n\n1. so I don't kill my car and\n2. I already know how much money it will be if I fill the tank from a quarter. 
1	Whenever I see a gas station and it‚Äôs less than half full. \nI had a Prius for 10 years and that shit goes another 60 miles after warning light comes on. Then got my new car and discovered I only have like 20 miles when light comes on. Scares me like no other that my car will konk out on the freeway
1	I have 50 km left in my car and will probably drive 45 today.  Fingers crossed my car doesn't stall in the middle of the street (again).
4	Annoying people is normal?	Is it normal to ENFP's try to show their love to people annoying them? Or annoying people just for fun, but also always trying to control the situation to not make people mad or something bad happen? Cause this is a normal thing to be and i wanted to know if it was a normal thing of ENFP
6	I read this as ‚Äúnormal people are annoying‚Äù and instantly agreed 
1	I have a friend ENFP and trust me this is completely normal lmao
1	This is literally my life! \nWhich has cause me to fall into depression because everyone just thinks I'm annoying now. I just want to show my love and appreciation for them or something they did, but it never seems to land and I don't understand.\n\nYou are not alone OP!
1	Yes butits very much light hearted fun
142	Programming is a great fit for ENFP's, don't listen to what the career guides say about it	Hey, fellow ENFPs that are interested in programming/technology!  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know a lot of the guides tell our type to stay clear of these kinds of roles but, speaking from experience as a full-time developer, it's bunk. If you are interested in programming I think it's a great fit for our personality type for the following reasons:\n\n* There's a healthy combination of stability and flexibility. Projects typically change often which mitigates boredom and the pay is generally good no matter where you go.  \n* You can find opportunities where you can work from anywhere so you don't have to fear being "anchored." A lot of developers are nomads traveling the world as they work and I'm not just talking freelancers. Many tech companies have distributed teams and this trend is increasing.\n* Scared of being locked away from people in a dark room stuck in front of a computer? Nonsense. There is so much collaboration and a huge community in the programming world, you won't feel like you're on an island. I can't stress this enough. The developer community is one of the most supportive and generous I've seen. I am collaborating all the time with really interesting people. \n* Programming is something big enough and constantly changing so there's always more to learn. As an ENFP, once I felt my learning slowed in other fields, I started mentally checking out because it wasn't interesting/challenging anymore. I guarantee you won't feel this in programming; there is so damn much to learn and technology is always evolving. \n* There is a ton of opportunity to make a real impact on causes you find important from working with organizations directly or contributing to open-source projects. \n* Have a thousand business ideas bouncing around in your mind? It will give you the toolset to prototype and test a lot of those ideas.\n* ENFP's are underrepresented in the programming world and personalities that are good with people are deeply needed. Not that other types aren't good with people, but you know what I mean here. \n\nSeriously, if you're considering pursuing it, do it. If you have never considered it, it's worth considering. It's not all roses and rainbows, but nothing is. However, it checks A LOT of the boxes most of us ENFPs find important and will give you a mobile launchpad to go almost any direction you want. \n\nHope this helps someone!
27	I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm seeing this. I thought I wanted to go into law or teaching, and then I realized programming is something I do for fun. I was worried it wouldn‚Äôt fit my personality, because of the stereotype I had thought of it, with it being kind of a job for introverts and not creative. However, I found that these are mostly wrong. \n\nBut all of the reasons you listed were great, and it took me a while to figure them out. Thanks for compiling them into a list and further ensuring that I‚Äôm probably going to be content going down this path! 
9	I think this just goes to highlight that your passions and skills don‚Äôt have to be immutably tied to your personality type. \n\nAs someone who loves computers and tinkering with both hardware and software, I thought Computer Science would be the perfect fit for me. However, I‚Äôm horrible at math. I can do it, but it takes a lot of effort and it doesn‚Äôt come naturally to me. I was a straight A student in HS except for math and it held me back from going to university until I was an adult. \n\nWhile I loved the tinkering aspect of coding, the design portions like UI and most of my non CS electives, I really struggled with anything math heavy, like algorithms and machine learning. I also found that assignments that most of my classmates were completing in about 10-15 hours of work, I was spending 40-60 hours on or more and still getting Cs. I ended up dropping out in my last year. After 21 years of doing the same thing and now wanting to change careers, I‚Äôm still struggling to decide what I want to do that will be meaningful and fulfilling to me but will also pay the bills. \n\nAt the end of the day, if you have the aptitude and the passion to do it, don‚Äôt let 4 letters dictate your life! 
10	I have an informatics teacher who is an ENFP and a math teacher who is also an ENFP. So i agree with you every type can fit in every professions. 
8	As an entp, its awesome to see this post. Enfps are passionate and dedicated workers if you treat them well. And every type is capable of great things.
4	Been coding since im 17 and im ENFP and I(23F) find freelance programming is awesome. Meet new people , constantly working on different projects and always learning it‚Äôs dope. 
3	Glad to see this, I was thinking about it too, I currently work in Tec and I would like to become a programmer. But I toughed might not be a great fit. I do really like my current job. 
3	Thank you for posting this! \n\nI tried programming a little while ago. I quitted because it feld too abstract and boring tbh. I want too give it another shot. Any tips?
3	[deleted]
3	Thank you for this!\n\nI am currently working as a data scientist doing a lot of web development in my role for a data visualization tool that I am creating for my client. But although I see how your points are valid, I find some of it not being applicable to my case, making me highly disappointed in development related work.\n\nTo summarize, I have to abide by the specifications asked by the client and the already highly established code infrastructure that I am working with does not allow room for suggestions. So my ideas does not benefit the client in any way, especially when I am not permissioned to hearing the use cases for the visualization. Resources and help that I gain are from documentation after documentation, and I am only able to work in my corporate office under business casual wear.\n\nBut most importantly, what disappoints me is the lack of math involved in my position, which is why I am looking for new opportunities. I think this is just my passion speaking though. \n\nMy question: how should I go about making the most use of my time to enjoy programming before I move forward to another role? Thanks!
3	In my eyes, any career is a good career choice for ENFPs, because we can do what the fuck we want
3	I work in DevOps but love coding infrastructure. I work from home and can work from anywhere on the EST time zone if I wanted too. I love the flexibility and work life balance. I love the work.
2	Hey I just want to say thank you so much for writing this out. As an enfp starting a CS masters and feeling pretty scared about it, this means a lot to me. 
2	Thanks for the morale boost! Really needed!
2	As an ENFP who picked up coding as a hobby 2 years ago, I couldn't agree more. And since I don't actually work in the field and just do it by myself for fun, I'm seeing a completely different side of this too!\n\nEven doing it just for myself though, making Android games let's me explore my creativity, come up with cool ideas and implement them.\n\nNever thought I would enjoy programming! I sucked at it when I took some classes many years ago in high school. But I love it so much now.
2	I agree. I started as a programmer and did that for 5 years than gradually went info more software quality assurance and analytical qa roles. I'm good in mentoring but also great at hunting down issues and troubleshooting production stuff. \nMy neverending need for knowledge took me in all sorts of projects and I have accumulated so much knowledge regrading our software process that people are amazed when I put clues together and identify root causes of defects with ease.\nBeing able to see interconnections and having good ideas is a gift not many have in this industry but it actually works magic. \nI strongly encourage ENFP people to try roles in IT/software dev. 
2	I took several college courses in programming and computer based languages. I never was able to grasp the idea of sitting all day typing at a computer. \n\nSo I ended up in desktop support :) \n\nHow would you recommend an ENFP with tons of energy get into programming? I watch my peers excel at it around me, but they never see my role as less than. \n\nWhere should I start? Currently sole provider, family of 3 with all his free time in the evening. Would you go college classes or online?\n\nLove this group, appreciate any suggestions 
2	Using programming knowledge to become a scripter in games would be so perfect for ENFPs. The entire point (in narrative driven, experiential games) is to script the game based on what players will do / what you want them to do, all so they‚Äôll have a particular experience playing a game.\n\nWho better to do that than the personality type who is most intuitive about other people‚Äôs feelings?\n\nPlus, like OP said, it‚Äôs flexible. You can change jobs easily, and the style of job can be very different. No one is surprised when a programmer has changed jobs every couple years. That‚Äôs good. Because ENFPs tend to want to.
2	I love programming! ENFP working as a data scientist. I think its more about the environment rather than wholly the specialization . I work in a start up environment and do consulting in data science so there is a lot of dynamism! And the people are great  and you never feel like 'just a number' :). 
1	Man. Do you know why programming is so well paid? Because hardly anyone can do it. If 10% of people would make good programs, suddenly salaries would plummet. Anyone can work in Walmart, so salaries suck. \n\nSecond thing: mediocre programmer actually slows down progress of projects, introducing bugs, spaghetti code and bottlenecks.\n\nI love programming... Of calculators ;)
1	I really enjoyed it for a fair while (a decade) before it started eating away at my soul. I then stayed too long because the money was good. Now I'm changing careers to social services where I can help people for a living.\n\nDo with that information what you will.
1	Maybe this comment would be better as a separate post rather than piggybacking onto this one, but anyway...\n\nAs I mentioned in another comment, I thought I‚Äôd enjoy CompSci so I went to university for it as an adult student at 27 with the intent to switch careers but ultimately found it too challenging and lost interest in it, ultimately dropping out in my 4th year. \n\nNow I‚Äôm really itching to make a leap of faith and switch careers after doing the same thing for 21 years. It‚Äôs a bit scary and I‚Äôve really had a hard time narrowing down finding something that I could excel at, I would find meaningful and engaging, satisfies my ENFP tendencies, would be flexible enough to do pursue my passions in my off time (travel, music and long-distance hiking) but also be able to provide a respectable living wage that would allow me to meet my financial commitments. \n\nMy frontrunner is currently teaching, which I think would be a great fit for me. 2 months off in the summer to do what I want, is respectable, fulfilling, challenging and pays reasonably well (I‚Äôm in Canada). However, I‚Äôd still have to go back and finish that degree. \n\nBack on topic, I‚Äôve also been looking at CS again. While I don‚Äôt know if it would fulfil my need for meaningful work, I‚Äôd be able to do consulting or freelance work anywhere in the world, allowing myself to travel and set my own hours. It would also potentially pay well, depending on what I was doing. \n\nI don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs really a question here... lol. I guess I am skeptical about my ability to be successful with Computer Science compared to more ‚Äútraditional‚Äù ENFP careers. I know I can do programming without having a degree, but having that paper definitely opens up a lot more opportunities. And you know an ENFP can never have too many choices (until they do)!\n
1	I LOVE programming, I do not do it professionally, only as hobby and I'm not advanced at all, but I certainly enjoy it and definitely see it as a viable career path in my future, should I ever change my mind about my current path. Thank you for posting this, I feel much more confident and validated in my feelings
3	For an intuitive, I really DESPISE learning from theory and I wonder why?	Programming? Lecture was useless to me. Give me working mini application and I will deduct the theory from that, or at least will understand how to apply the "theory". Math? Screw those definitions. They're a waste of paper in high school books. Dedicate the same paper space to working examples of how to solve this and that, and I will create the theory and my own definitions from scratch (of course I'm oblivious, but I feel like a Newton or Pythogoras in that moment :D). \n\nHell, while not everyone will love my "definitions" it seems many people would find them much more down to earth and understandable, even if they're much longer than some wild mixture of letters and numbers. \n\nBut I wonder why? Were intuitives not supposed to learn from theory, instead of repeating examples like some monkey first?\n\nThis fascinates me to this day and I wonder if anyone else works like that. And why? \n\nAlso, this may feel like bragging, but what I learned during whole university course (and it wasn't really much, I sucked as a student and the uni sucked as a place to learn), I could teach someone that in 4 months instead of 4 years!
2	I feel the same way with many things.\n\nMost of what I learned in programming was  in smaller classes by watching the teacher writing the code in a way that his thought process behind it was more or less exposed. I would pick up clues and details that someone experienced would have difficulties explaining in a lecture due to it being more "static". I can also relate to math definitions which I learned more efficiently with examples, but I'd say my lack of rigor and attention causes way more trouble than learning the theory behind it.\n\nWhere I tend to learn things the most efficiently is in the topics in which I already have some self-taught knowledge and understanding that I acquired while tinkering with it or thinking about it. Can it do that, can it resist this, can it behave such as, what if... \n\nOnce I come across general theory, I'd then compare and adapt my initial knowledge. Guitar scales, for example, seemed downright impossible and way too boring before I learned to play a bit by myself and found out about how notes roughly worked together. \n\nWatching very skilled people performing their task is quite insightful, we ENFPs are good at reading people and picking up clues and subtle actions. Why did they do that first? What tool did he used? How were his fingers aligned? Where is his left hand at? What are they currently looking?\n\nSo to sum it up... I'd say we get bored or annoyed of learning by the book and we'd rather work on our own way of interpreting and doing things, at least in our head.
1	Certain things will annoy ENFPs and learning from theory that is all "analytical" is one of these things.\n\nPOLR Ti inside an ENFP is the reason.  You ENFP prefer Te and using Fi as the connective tissue.\n\nWith ENTPs it is the opposite with POLR Fi where they are fine with the theory but the subjective relations of Fi being the connective tissue annoy / bore / does not make sense to them.
1	This sounds like a lot of your Te and I get it. So much of education is very inefficient and also very one-size-fits-all. I personally am a visual learner. I can try to read about something, theory, etc. but as soon as I see a diagram, pie graph, see it in action, etc. I get it instantly. And I agree that college takes a little information and stretches it out. After all they want 4 years of money, not 4 months.
4	Free bowling	So, last year I had a goal of actually getting with a friend group so I don't always feel so alone. Not to brag, but I was pretty successful, although misguided at first. I thought that I would find it through my significant other at the time, but I quickly learned that her friends couldn't see me as more than "her boyfriend." So moving on from that relationship(toxic for both of us), I joined a Rocky Horror cast that was a phenomenal outlet and brought me close to a merry band of misfits!  \n\n\nThis year, I am trying to ground myself a little better in this reality so I don't just end up playing in my head all day. So at a birthday party yesterday(had completely forgotten about it), and I only 70% really wanted to go. However a combination of posts here and an ENFP youtuber started bouncing around in my head. Yes mentality, 70% means 100%, and so on and so on. So I go, expecting to be out a pretty penny to go bowling at this vintage bowling alley. I walk in and the party is already in full swing, I'm handed a pair of slick black bowling shoes, a drink, and put down at a table with all the junk food you normally avoid. Surrounded by conversation, silliness, warm bodies, and balloons I really couldn't have asked for more....but wait there is more! So as we are winding down I start asking around looking for who is paying for all of this, I don't mind a free horse, but I like to contribute my part. So no one I asked had payed or put down a card for anything...confused I continue to investigate till I come to this lumberjack looking fella, he just looks at me, smiles, and says, "Man, I own the place just enjoy yourself."   \n\n\nReality rules my friends, no matter how distracting fiction and the insides of our mind can be....I think I like this world, and I want to be rooted and woven into it.  \n\n\nAnyway, remember to connect to this world or risk getting lost in slumps and ever deeper valleys. Say yes to the late night invite, talk to everyone, BE BOLD, and remember that I love all of you.
2	H E L P: ENFP girlfriend with an INTJ boyfriend who doesn‚Äôt put in any effort with appearance	Hi! \n\nMy bf and I have been in a relationship for 5 months, but we‚Äôve known each other a little over a year. He‚Äôs an INTJ, I‚Äôm a female ENFP, and we‚Äôre both in our late 20s. \n\nWhen we go out I normally look presentable, I think I have a classy/urban fashion sense but I‚Äôm not super into makeup nor do I buy high-end name brand items. Him on the other hand...he‚Äôs a bit more.... practical when it comes to his wardrobe selection. Brilliant man, but zero effort is put into how he looks when he‚Äôs in public. We went on vacation to the mountains once and he only packed 4-6 t-shirts(those puny and sometimes cheesy shirts),  2 pair of sweat pants (think the really comfy Walmart kind but with 3-4 years of wear and tear), a pair or two of long Jon‚Äôs, underwear, socks, and a somewhat heavy jacket.\n\nMy concern is this: when you go out into the world, first impressions are sometimes all you get. We‚Äôre super competitive and really ambitious when it comes to our careers and I genuinely just want him to be the absolute BEST he can be and it just makes him appear like a bum standing next to me, when I know he‚Äôs not. I can see and sense people looking at us with confusion when we‚Äôre out and about, and I worry that it‚Äôll make him insecure in the long run. He‚Äôs been making more comments about why he dresses the way he does after he sees what I‚Äôm wearing (almost defending the practicality of it...oh, the logic). Like I said, he‚Äôs brilliant, oh and very cute underneath the whole Albert Einstein/Beethoven prodigy genius initial appearance. He‚Äôs very well educated, has an amazing job at a really great company but I KNOW he could do/be better with his wardrobe and just self care in general. \n\nMy questions:\n\n1. How do I tell him or help him without coming off like I‚Äôm trying to change him, be his mom, bruise his ego, or make him feel like he‚Äôs not good enough as is? \n\n2. Are there any guys out there who‚Äôve had their girlfriend/wife tell them this? Was it something you improved over time, or before you knew it your side of the closet was full of ‚ÄúChristmas and birthday presents‚Äù from her? ü§î \n\n\nOpen to all comments but I‚Äôd love to hear from an INTJ male who can kinda help me approach this through their INTJ lensü§ì
4	Try appealing to his logical and practical side. Tell him this is a worthy project to take on because it will make him more competitive in his field and give better first impressions. Also, assure him that it's not complicated. People who aren't into being fashionable tend to see the idea of upping your style game as unnecessarily complicated. \n\nThere are different ways to approach cultivating a sense of personal style and neat appearance. I've found the 'personal uniform' approach works well with INTJs, because its a simple, practical, and logical way to deal with how to dress. My best friend in college was an INTJ, and she asked me for help when she got her first real job in an office. She loved the personal uniform approach and really upped her game when she started doing it.\n\nThe personal uniform approach is basically where you decide on a 'uniform' for yourself. You wear the same basic outfit every day, with just a few minor changes, like different colors or fabrics depending on stuff like season or weather. It's easiest to understand with some examples:\n\n**Steve Jobs** is the most famous 'uniform' dresser I can think of. He always wore loose blue jeans, a black mock turtleneck, and New Balance sneakers. \n\n**Mark Zuckerberg** always wears blue jeans in a natural cut, a grey Cuccinelli t-shirt, and grey sneakers.\n\n**Obama** always wears suits in either blue or grey. \n\n**Hillary Clinton's** uniform is a pantsuit. She does them in neutral colors, often black or tan, with a colorful shell top underneath.\n\nThese are some high profile examples so they are really pared down, but there are others. Some women live in chinos with matching sweater sets. Some women always wear black or navy pencil skirts with a crisp white shirt and black heels. Some dudes always wear skinny jeans, t-shirt, and hoodie in black.  Some dudes live in boot cut jeans and plaid button-ups. These are all examples of personal uniforms. \n\nThis type of dressing is advantageous for several reasons, especially for really logical, practical people:\n\n1) It makes shopping easier. You know what you're looking for when you go out, and when you find something that works, you can buy several of them.\n\n2) It makes getting dressed in the morning simple. There are few decisions that have to be made. This is why a lot of high-powered politicians and entrepreneurs dress like this, to reduce decision fatigue.\n\n3) You're always comfortable. Once you've settled on a uniform, you don't have to deal with that one item you have which looks good but is uncomfortable. Build comfort into your personal uniform, and you will always be comfortable.\n\nTry presenting this to him as a project to take on that will make his life easier and more efficient once it's done.\n\n\n\n\n
3	I'm like him but am female and realised that while listening to my friends talk I like to admire their make up or clothing colour etc. And I realised that looking nice is a visual gift to others. We are drawn to look at art and views and cute animals, likewise we enjoy it when our conversation partner looks neat or interesting or follows current fashion etc.   So dressing up or doing your hair is a courtesy to entertain someone's vision while you are both conversing. Yes I'm autistic lol. 
3	Buy  them clothes, that you know they would like.
2	This is an ENFP sub, so maybe ask the INTJ sub for their input?\n\nI have 4 great friends, all male, and 3 of them are INTJ. It took them a while to figure out how to dress. But the conclusion they all individually came to was that if they wanted to be taken seriously, they needed to dress like it. Even if that‚Äôs not how they think, everyone else does. \n\nIf someone dressed up as a giant yellow chicken was walking around giving advice on how best to diversify a stock portfolio, that person probably won‚Äôt get the same respect as their competitor saying the same thing, but wearing a suit.\n\nBasically, if you look irrelevant or useless, people will assume that‚Äôs what you are. And from what I understand, there‚Äôs nothing INTJs hate more than being thought of as irrelevant or useless.
3	Its a problem withcthe personality type. Born logical  abd dont understand emotions. Youll have to logically convince him the importance of emotion/people skills. Then you can start teaching him these \n\nWe dont understand that people are not all into logic and efficiency like us 
1	Help him! Ok, think Steve Jobs and Monk, and that Facebook-creator guy. They all wear the SAME thing every day. Less focus on wardrobe/style = more focus on the career/creativity etc. So his current style is... Meh. \nTake him to the salon, get him a good cut/style + any product he needs vabd schedule his next 2 follow up appointments right then and there. No walk-in places like sportscuts (unless you tell him he has an appointment and make him set it on his phone). Then go get 1 outfit that is more appropriate for outings/dates. And then buy several of the same one. Tell him he can wear his cheesy Ts under the shirt/sweater that is more suitable. \nOk, when I tell YOU to do this, I'm not saying it has to be you. He might appreciate it more if you enlist a friend or even hire a personal shopper. That might take away the mothering notion. \nOther people pay for his brilliant skills (whatever they are), make him pay others for the style skill that he doesn't possess. \nChances are he has recognized that his style has drawn unwanted attention and that is why he is a bit defensive. The truth is, though, he will never be able to convince the random gawker of the practicality and logic of his dress and grooming.  Ultimately, he WILL appreciate your efforts - IF you have the right attitude. \nPeople change other people. In other words, we DO affect each other. There is nothing wring with intending to affect so no one in a good  way. So, just tell him no so!  Say, "I think it will be benefit you in your career, in the long run, if you make a few changes now and I'd like to help." Tell him you can be as involved as he wants you to be but that you think if he dresses and grooms himself for success, then it is more likely that he will succeed. And if he is consistent with his style, he doesn't have to waste time thinking about the mundane: clothing and haircuts. He can give his mind to  more meaningful endeavors. If he really just wants to wear t shirts, sweatpants, socks with his sandals and a long unkempt beard or something, then he can certainly do so. Especially if he is a millionaire.  It works for those duck dynasty guys. (And their wives are stylish!)
1	Im an Intj male and my advise is try to be like his mother try to tell him how to wear properly and keep insisting (not all the times) but at the same time you should be reasonable and tell him why. Also you can try go shopping with him and help him choose a suitable and a practical clothes at the same times. Don‚Äôt be afraid talking to him he should be open minded person. 
1	Does he want to change how he dresses? Maybe he does, but maybe he's content with it already. I would ask him this first. Just straight up, "Would you like some help in upgrading your wardrobe?" \n\nIf the answer is no, then let him be. 
1	Talk to him and tell him your concerns. Being honest is always better than holding hidden resentments. Don't let the feelings grow into bitterness or dislike.
1	I‚Äôm also an enfp dating an intj and my intj bf doesn‚Äôt care about style either. So I bought him a bunch of clothes for Christmas that are comfy but stylish hoping he‚Äôll wear them :) 
184	This candid photo is epitome of INTJ- ENFP stereotypes... spot the ENFP!	
46	Too much facial expression for a stereotypical INTJ. Remove the muscles in the area of his eyes and you got a perfect one.
18	What a great smile. Good for you, fellow ENFP!
15	I can't remember the difference in percentages, but male ENFPs are far less common than females and so it's just a curious observation for me as a dude to always see my role reversed in gender. Now that I'm in my 30's I don't have the giant smile pictures I used to take nearly every time, maybe life is getting to me ha...
13	The man is clearly the ENFP. Look at his goofy eyebrows. The woman is clearly the INTJ. She is wearing makeup and that smile which she had to learn to present herself to society as more ‚Äúwomanly‚Äù but you cannot miss the cold hard reason in her eyes.\n\nI may or may not be joking. 
11	INTJ commented before the photo: ‚Äúthis is....disorienting‚Äù
9	Typical expression of an INTJ standing in glitter 
9	My boyfriend is an ISTJ and this basically sums us up. This picture is fantastic!
6	LOL!!!! This picture gives me so much life!!!! I heart INTJs!!!!
3	This is what all of mine and my INTJ boyfriend‚Äôs pictures look like lol\n
3	Happy new year! Great captured moment ^^
2	this is hysterical. hahahahaha 
2	So which is which? Sorry the comments got me confused
1	I‚Äôm an ENFP male and would definitely make that face the guy is making. We don‚Äôt really force it lol on paper we look like the female but we aren‚Äôt like that in my opinion. 
6	ENFP Pics on Instagram	Hey there ENFP people, INFJ here, with an ENFP girlfriend by my side.\n\nLooking for a way to stop my worries. Maybe you can help me by understanding better by reasoning or something.\n\nUntil now I felt very good in a relationship to an ENFP Girl, who is surely an Attention seeker :) \n\nBut mostly in a good way. I always appreciated her doing crazy stuff and talking about it...\n\nbut now a year ago, my girl discovered the fame behind posting half nude pics on instagram. And I know what happens if I try to talk her out if something / stopping any obsession she has. \n\nSo I try to reason for myself, how to get along with it. \n\nTo be honest I would love to hear something like "hey, dont worry, 6000 users (that is her follower count after a year) don't matter much, she just wants the easy likes to feel good, they aren't important".\n\nOr something like "nah, you got boring, she moved on to the next thing".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre Girls here, that do the same thing and can tell me, why their boyfriend shouldn't be worried?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
3	Mmm sounds like she‚Äôs got personal issues and insecurities. I‚Äôm an ENFP (sometimes to the core) but social media isn‚Äôt really my thing except for LinkedIn if you count that üòÇ \n\nMaybe you could try digging a little deeper into what that means to her to have that many followers and be so scantily dressed in her pictures. Is there any area you think you might be lacking or skimping on in the relationship: stopped giving compliments, stopped showing appreciation, let yourself go...whatever. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs you but just try and see it from as many angles as you can. 
3	This isn‚Äôt an ENFP thing. People who use social media often are usually insecure or lonely, because well, that‚Äôs what social media does to us. I would bring it up with her, tell her how it makes you feel or how it makes her look. People like this that are constantly looking for any attention can be dangerous, be careful! 
2	dude here but I'm not sure you can get good intel here.  totally depends on her mindset. for some it's like having a superhero alter ego, with a superpower. for others it's getting likes for a cosplay, and have closet dreams of turning it into something profitable. some just love the juice from sexual admirers, and have a hard time putting it down even tho it's not going anywhere.\n\n
2	I‚Äôm an ENFP and I used to seek attention from social media like her as well but that was because I was very insecure. As I‚Äôve gotten a little older and more comfortable with myself, I don‚Äôt care about social validation anymore. 
3	Complicated (?) ENFP-INFJ hookup-turned-friendship	Hi ENFPlers,\n\nINFJ female here with the usual "help me understand this guy" question:\n\nI met an ENFP last summer. Really hit it off, our sense of humour, our propensity for playing with words, interests, my quality of story-telling, it all aligned. Plus he said he found me ridiculously attractive. However, I met him on a day when I found out that I would be moving to another country after 3 months, so I told him that I would prefer us to be casual.\n\nAs you can probably imagine, I fell in love with him. And started to hate that casual thing. He decided to withhold sex anyway, saying that we should just be friends. READ: Friends who cuddle, text each other all day every day, send songs to each other (him to me, not the other way round), sleep in the same bed, and tell each other that they love each other. I have also met all of his immediate family members.\n\nI moved, but visited him a few weeks later and stayed at his place- and again he said he doesn't want to have sex, we would just both end up wanting more, I am dangerous, whatnot. I told him that I already want more, so hey ho :)\n\nUpon my return back to my new home country, he texted me that we should just be platonic friends. And proceeded to tell me about some short-term fling he just started (which ended a few weeks later). \n\nI had a meltdown, but recovered, and agreed to the whole friendship thing. This means: texting every day, now also calling most weekends for hours, being "there for each other" as emotional support in times of need, sending photos of everyday life, sharing jokes, memes, and him still sending me his favourite songs (almost daily). \n\nGiven that this is not really the level of frequency and intensity that characterises my other friendships in terms of communication, I asked him again what keeps him from giving "us" a chance. To which he responded that there's no chemistry. Heartbreaking. But apparently I am his BFF, he talks more with me than with anyone else, respects me, thinks I am truly special, and cannot imagine his life without me. \n\nNow, as heart breaking as this is for me, I am able to accept this for the greater good of preserving what truly is an incredible connection, even if just on friendship-y terms. I'll die when he tells me he met someone he wants to be in a serious relationship with, but I'll cross that bridge when I get there. \n\nBut somehow still my intuition is calling BS on this. ENFP or no ENFP, you're not THAT nice and committed to someone you used to have sex with and could have just dropped like a hot potato once that person moved away. Or ARE YOU?\n\nI'm seeing him again in 2 weeks. Please give me some insights here, because as much as I'd like to just take him at his word, I have held this man, I have listened to him, I talk to him pretty much every day. I can't be that wrong to think that he does have more feelings for me than he lets on. \n\n&#x200B;
1	Not worth your time. Ditch them. If they message you message back. But dont wait around.\n\nThing is, wait as long as you want. But ur already asking questions that prove you are more vulnerable. Dont you deserve a team mate who puts in the same effort?\n\nYou can wait, but can you disatance yourself? The answer seems to be no.\n\n\nCan u still just be friends? (Can u distance yourself from the task at hand)\n\nAsk yourself that honestly? And f**k things that make you hesitate.(no butts, just solid truths) Messure yourself, and play the cards u have been delt.\n\nEdit F bomb
1	This is a tough one.... It sounds like you cannot continue being just friends with him due to your overwhelming feelings, and I'm not sure if he understands that. ENFPs are very caring individuals, but sometimes we can assume "hey, this person is a lot like me. That means what is important and unimportant to me is that same as what important and unimportant to  them." So I'm theorizing that in his mind, he can see you guys being friends long term without it progressing beyond that, and obviously that's not an option for you. You gotta be straight up and really real with him, and let him know that you can't keep going on like this and what needs to change.\n\nAnd also >you're not THAT nice and committed to someone you used to have sex with and could have just dropped like a hot potato once that person moved away.\nYes we can. Out of sight, out of mind, unfortunately. I am an ENFP and I'm a hoe. I have shared a lot of very deep conversations with my hookups, and there are several of them that I have felt a very strong connection with. And it a lot of ways, I love them. I love who they are I want them to be happy. But I'm not *in love* with them. When we're done hooking up and I go home, I'm back in my own world to a certain extent. So just because he moved on doesn't necessarily mean he doesn't/didn't have very intense feelings and connection with you, but it probably does mean that he isn't in love with you. I'm sorry.\n\nTake it all with a grain of salt, everyone is different and maybe I'm interpreting what you're saying the wrong way. Like I said, I think you need to very clearly and directly lay out what you want to happen with your relationship and what the results will be if things do not change from how they are.
35	I'm an ENFP and I prefer having introverted friends/romantic partners. Are there other ENFPs out there who feel the same?	 
15	You ENFP, while technically extroverted, have introverted-tendencies mixed in as well. Even sometimes being called something along the lines of ‚ÄòThe most introverted-extrovert‚Äô. Introverts more easily supply you with the right amount of affection/attention that this type usually desires. Not to mention, all the ENFPs/ESFPs I‚Äôve met seem to be enamored with we introverts‚Äô more ‚Äòcat-like‚Äô disposition (Aloof, mysterious, hidden).\n\nI‚Äôd like to think of ENFPs as Yang: Sunny and warm, with a secret obsession for what others may consider dark or morbid, but it would seem your type believes it more misunderstood and in need of healing. I find myself wondering sometimes though: Is it that your type believes they can mend the darkness? Or is it that this type finds comfort for themselves within the shadowy-sanctuary?\n\nOn the opposite side (same coin) we introverts are like Yin: Mostly made up of the dark, but secretly yearning for the light.
18	yes. most of my close friends are introverts, my romantic partners/people i have been interested in romantically are mostly introverts as well. i find extroverts slightly too draining for my liking. plus some extroverted types literally wear their hearts on their sleeves so there‚Äôs not much exploring/unravelling for me to do which i love! each person is a mystery and i like to slowly decipher them or i‚Äôd get really bored and tired. introverts are amazing. 
9	Most of my friends are introverts and yes, my ideal relationship is with an introverted woman. I‚Äôm consciously aware of the fact that I am attracted and drawn to the quiet, shy women. So I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs normal and natural?
6	I don‚Äôt have a preference. I like extroverts because they ususally have fun ideas and places to go. But my bf is an introvert & i can drag him out occasionally and he is very charming
7	I feel the same way.  I never considered myself to be an extrovert.  I feel more comfortable around people who are a little bit quieter but still friendly.  I like teasing them and drawing them out.  The stereotypical extravert is usually too loud and attention-seeking for my taste.  I like people I can get to focus on me and have a deep conversation with.  As long as they like to do fun things too.
6	Yes I do prefer introverts as friends because I can have deeper conversations with them as with extroverts
4	I really like both. My introvert friends for their peaceful composure and presence, their well thought through remarks and surprising inner worlds.\n\nMy extroverted friends, for their jest for life that they share with me. Especially with my ESFP friend it is very nice that for once the assertive energy doesn't have to primarily come from me.

3	In the past I was never keyed into the ‚Äúextroverted / introverted‚Äù thing until my now-ISTP-boyfriend came around and introduced the MBTI world to me (thus informing me of my ENFP-ness). \n\nOnce I had read about and researched the types, discussing them at length with my s/o, everything in my past began to make sense. It was basically glass shattering at certain moments and situations. I realized that all of my best friends are introverts and most of my successful romantic relationships were with introverted guys. \n\nBeing an extravert who‚Äôs also very quiet (we are the most introverted extraverts), allows me to fluctuate between energy levels. I can be outward and expressive at work and in school and do all sorts of ‚Äúsurface area‚Äù ENFP stuff and then when I‚Äôm with my boyfriend and close friends I wind down and am happier.\n\nI definitely think that ENFPs and introverts chime together well. It‚Äôs healthy because it creates a definite balance (on both ends).
2	I surround myself with ENFPs, INFPs, & INFJs
36	50% of days: Just let me be mad! Everyone else gets to be mad! Other 50% of days: Why so mad? It ain‚Äôt worth getting mad over.	Anyone else work themselves up into a temper by simply overthinking something? And you just want to be mad because why not? It seems everyone else is allowed to get mad from time to time. And then on Other days, I‚Äôm incredibly even tempered and can call myself without thinking too much about it.\n\nI almost wish I was just one type of person so that I can learn who that is and deal with it good or bad. Does anyone else feel like they‚Äôre multiple types of people on any given day?
3	With you on this one... like, if you‚Äôre gonna be mad, you might as well go full ham.
3	This post summarizes my life
2	Yup. Constantly! 
5	STEM Jobs as an ENFP?	I‚Äôm a college student still figuring out wtf I‚Äôm doing with my life but of course all my career tests tell me ‚Äúartist‚Äù ‚Äúsocial worker‚Äù yadda yadda yadda. Problem is is I really want to work in something higher paying and more interesting. I mean I definitely am MOST inclined to be an artist (I‚Äôm a musician and went to a performing arts high school and everything) and while I would love if this could be my career, I know it‚Äôs not a solid career choice and I know what it takes to make it in that industry and I don‚Äôt got it. \nBottom line, I‚Äôm thinking that I want to go into veterinary medicine but I‚Äôm nervous that my non stem inclined brain is going to sabotage me. I do alright in school but I‚Äôm definitely no brainiac (unlike my wizkid INTJ boyfriend). I love animals and I‚Äôm passionate about the work vets do, and I‚Äôm a good ‚Äúmemorizer‚Äù when it comes to things that interest me (I store information about certain topics obsessively) and I‚Äôm a good problem solver (ya girl loves 2000 piece puzzles like it‚Äôs crack) but I‚Äôm just worried I‚Äôm going to struggle too hard and it is all going to be money and effort wasted. \nAny STEM field or Veterinary ENFP‚Äôs in the group?
6	Omg I had very similar fears last year.  Mainly I started back to school to go into STEM because I love science.  All my personality/career tests would tell me what you said and not to go into hard science or engineering or the like.  But my interest inventories would say, ‚ÄúScience! Science! Science!‚Äù With art and social coming next. \n\nI have a very bubbly personality, and I found a lot of people in science seemed to be very serious.  I was very concerned I would not fit in and/or that I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúsmart‚Äù enough.  Come to find out that‚Äôs b.s.  I‚Äôve been making all A‚Äôs and B‚Äôs (even got an A in o-chem).  Pretty good for someone who thought they weren‚Äôt ‚Äúmath smart‚Äù like geeks Jeff or Matt from high school.  \n\nSo I‚Äôd say - if this is what you really want, put your insecurities of how you think you ‚Äúshould‚Äù be or think to the side and give yourself a chance.  I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre smarter than you give yourself credit for.  As for me, I‚Äôve decided to stop having pre-conceived notions of what a scientist or engineer ‚Äúshould‚Äù look like, and just do what I want to do.  Nobody ever made advances in science by thinking the same as everyone else.  (There are actually a couple very famous ENFP physicists.)\n\nSo...go for it!  If it turns out you really do not flourish in that field, THEN you can think about not doing it.  Remember too, a lot of people fail before they succeed.  I completely bombed some tests in calculus and chemistry, but now I‚Äôm fine.  I know a guy who had to start in remedial math upon entering college.  Now he is a calculus II tutor and an engineering major.  And for the love of all things precious and holy...do NOT hold back pursuing something in life out of fear!
3	Qualified nurse here that studies clinical science at uni. 
3	Chemical Engineer here! Completed my Bachelors and Masters in Chemical Engineering  before the age of 22. \n\nStill an ENFP\n\nStill creative \n\nStill wacky\n\nStill earning a bag\n\nDo what you want to do
2	i have an ‚ÄòaRts BrAin‚Äô which means i‚Äôm more inclined to the arts. granted, i‚Äôm better in subjects like language and literature and writing in general (consistent 95 percentiles in school). i‚Äôm more creative than logical. but i realise in recent years that what makes me tick is the rigour of the sciences, so i‚Äôve taken up subjects like biology and chemistry at the higher level, along with mathematics. struggled like crazy at the start, mostly because i‚Äôve let my aRts BrAin and all that mbti career bullshit limit me. i was consistently failing and satisfaction felt like a distant memory to me. i kept working at it, because i didn‚Äôt want a career as a journalist (nothing wrong with that, i just don‚Äôt enjoy writing 24/7), i wanted to challenge myself to be good at something i wasn‚Äôt naturally gifted at and i love the sciences. finished the school year being in the 95 percentiles for my sciences, with various offers for advanced science scholarships for college. \n\nin the end, i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôll actually take up those offers because you know, enfp‚Äôs have crazy aspirations and now i think i‚Äôd like to try my hand at political science! so that‚Äôs going to be a new challenge for me. \n\nbut hey, the brain is malleable. intelligence is a muscle. and mbti career suggestions hold no water. you make your own choices :)\n\nGOOD LUCK FELLOW ENFP!
2	In any given field any personality type can succeed if they are aware of how to leverage the things they are good at and work on or minimize the things they struggle with. Most people in any given job aren't the best at their job, they're just adequate. as an ENFP you are more than capable of being better than adequate at anything you try, as long as it holds your interest. This seems to interest you, you will probably do great at it as long as you stay focused. For me, that is the hard part. I'm not in STEM but in college I started in physics and astronomy (loved physics in HS), moved on from it once I realized I wasn't as into it as much as I needed to be. \n\nBut beyond the rigors of coursework, think of all the great ways that you as an ENFP can prove yourself to be *better* than your peers. Maybe its being aware of how to present yourself. Maybe you are able to connect with people easier, which is great for networking. In any given field the people who get ahead are going to be the ones that rub people the right way when they first meet, and present themselves as being competent and confident. Be friendly and engaging with the professors, they will be the ones writing letters of recommendation for jobs, internships, and graduate schools. Obviously do well in your classes, but it is important to have people connections as well. There is no reason why an ENFP can't do great in STEM
2	Raised in an asian background and was exposed to STEM for the majority of my life.\n \nAbout to complete a bachelors in actuarial studies and statistics, but halfway through my degree I contemplated moving into psychology after doing sales. \n\nHowever I always loved understanding the world around me, and statistics allowed me to understand why certain behaviours come from what variables. Data management is pretty dry but unveiling statistical truths is worth it.\n\nI have a grad role as a consultant and I am really grateful for a job that lets me brainstorm and critically analyse problems in a team. Big shoutout to STEM as a field. I don‚Äôt see any reason why ENFPs can‚Äôt enjoy it. Its puzzles, understanding the world, and goddamn is it not satisfying when you intuitively understand your subjects instead of memorising!\n
5	Anyone else feel like the duality in the latest Black Mirror is yourself?	I‚Äôm not talking about the schizophrenia side, or the being controlled by other people, but I feel like whenever I have to make a choice, I‚Äôm thinking about everything that comes along with it, and that makes me uncomfortable, and makes me question my decisions to the point of not actually making one. Cause I just feel it‚Äôs easier not to make one.\n\nAlthough when it came to the show, I could easily make a really fucked up decision on a whim, cause it‚Äôs a show, or when it comes to my friends, I can easily help them make really good decisions.\n\nTLDR: When it‚Äôs not related to me, I can help people a lot, when it comes to me, I can‚Äôt decide for shit.\n
1	This is so relatable. Might be because once matters get personal the outcome has much more effects on your life so its much harder to decide... but those cornflakes are lookin mighty fine rn 
2	Gay Enfp into intj	Hey Guys.... I really been into this intj guy for quite some time and I have mistyped before because of my insecurities (Nts and Infp) but I have finally concluded that I'm a enfp but btw\n\nI'm really into him and I think we have a strong connection but I think I was being selfish with how I loved the guy he made me feel secure .... Yeah but I don't want him to think I'm using him for validation .. im over that area of life. Blame it on my childhood. You guys think there is any way to make a mends with him and make him believe in our relationship again? 
8	Going to university soon and would love to make some ENFP friends (or one). How do I find/spot you guys?	Any tips on how to spot you/approach you? I'm an INFJ and have had an ENFP friend in the past and would love to find some more. You guys are really cool.\n\nThanks in advance for any answers
10	If someone randomly starts talking to you in public... Pay attention, it might be us.
10	Just look for the person whose deepest fear is not being liked.\n\nOr look for a person who wants to hide in their room as often as they want to be the center of attention.
5	How to deal with my insecurity in the relationship?	So i am dating this ENTP girl and we've been doing well in the beginning of the relationship.\nShe is very close to her friends and used to always spend crazy times with them and after she started dating me she wants to keep the balance and is very Worried about it. She also told me that she doesn't really get attached and "easily gives up on things".\nThe thing is, as time passed, my clingy nature as well as some of my insecurities came to surface, i have been raised by an NPD which developped in me a certain fear of being abandoned, fear of not being approved and a crippling lack of confidence.\nI have always kept on working on them but in my relationship i am sometimes feeling that i am not her priority even when there's no reason to believe so, if she gets out with her friends but doesn't tell me and spends a whole day without talking to me i'd feel like i'm not an important part of her life and get annoyed and sometimes really annoyed. If we make plans to have a movie but goes watch that movie with a friend and forgets our plan i'd throw a tantrum.\nRight now we are way more into each other than we were and she started tk get really attached to me and told me "please do not think about that thing i said in the past" but i still do despite knowing she loves me and that is starting tk ruin my relationship with me always demanding things and i felt like i pushed it a bit.\nI know the origins of my actions but i'm asking for advice as to good practices to not let this ruin my romanticrelationship nor my other human relationships, so please how do i deal with my insecurity,  build a sustainable confidence instead of the temporary boosts of confidence i get and that turn into insecurities.\nWe ENFP tend to be clingy lovers but i feel it's suffocating for the partner and i want to be mentally more healthy and balanced,\nSo i'll be looking forward to read your constructive comments. No hate guys xD
4	I‚Äôm an ENFP and not clingy at all lol. Maybe in my younger days...28 currently. But yea if anything I think my INTJ bf is clingy lol and that‚Äôs sayin somethin for his type! But we also come from different races, cultures, countries, had different upbringings and experiences, different ethnicities, different native languages....At the end of the day she‚Äôs going to tell and show you things that go beyond those 4 letters. My advice: communicate, communicate, communicate till it seems like maybe it‚Äôs too much (it‚Äôs not) you probably just hit the sweet spot actually. \n\nGood luck!
1	I suspect my partner is an xNTP despite testing as an ENFP. He needs endless alone time & for a long time i would panic everytime we weren‚Äôt together. If you are like me then maybe it passes after a while & you don‚Äôt feel that way anymore. But it‚Äôs ok to move on if you can‚Äôt wait on them
9	Forgiving yourself?	I know a lot of us ENFP‚Äôs are quick to forgive others and not ourselves. Has anyone here learned how to forgive themselves and stop putting the blame only on them when something goes wrong? \n\nHope everyone has a wonderful day! 
3	Nope, it's usually my fault and my responsibility to troubleshoot and fix it.
3	ENFPs are strong at forgiving themselves due to being extroverts with strong Fe even though Fe is a shadow function for ENFPs it is a function ENFPs are very good at for ENFPs are strong with two shadow functions Ni and Fe and since Fe is an extroverted function and ENFPs are extroverts there is a natural ego alingment with the energy directions with extroversion and introversion.\n\n------\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHehe but self acceptance is different it is an internal process.  ***That is the rub***, one must deal with ones internal world and accept the truth with various introverted functions internally.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFurthermore, one this occurs one must resynchorize ones internal world with the external world.\n\nIf this sounds like movie storytelling such as the heroes journey by Joseph Campbell or the similar thing with Dan Harmon's 8 step story wheel / circle there is a reason for that. Joseph Campbell was a Carl Jung scholar and assembled a list of Jung essays over several decades calle The Portable Jung.\n\nI am away from the good fast internet but google Dan Harmon Wheel / Monomyth / The Heroes Journey not in google search but instead google image search.  Also notices in some of the more complicated images you see a day / night divide or two trees one with leaves reaching to heaven and another type of branch called roots reaching through the soil for nutrients.  Paraphrases a Jung quote (mixing it wkth some Robert Browning) when we reach for Heaven / The Sky we must also reach for Mother Earth / Cthonic / The Underworld / Hell in order to reach a higher heaven.  Put another way (by a different group of people who influence Jung) As above, so below, to accomplish the miracle of one thing.  
2	This is something I struggle with sooo hard. I'm better than I used to be but like, when I'm stabbed in the back by someone I care about I ALWAYS give second chances. I used to give zillions of chances until I realized how toxic that is. But myself? I beat myself up over literally everything and there are a few things in my past I've tried so hard to forgive myself for and still, I start thinking about these few things once in awhile and then I feel like I'm the hugest piece of shit ever (and they're not the worst things ever, they're pretty common stupid life choices but still...) üòî 
1	I can forgive myself pretty easily... but that‚Äôs probably just because I‚Äôve confirmed that I‚Äôm not very smart, and I know I don‚Äôt tend to make very good decisions. In other words, I can forgive myself because I never trusted myself to get it right in the first place.
7	Why is the pairing of INTJ and ENFP so common?	A lot of posts and websites I‚Äôve been through always pair INTJ and ENFP together, and me and my significant other are INTJ and ENFP. Is it really as common as it seems? And since we‚Äôre the exact opposites does it always work? \n\nIt‚Äôs been so interesting to see so many pairings like this, it really makes me think. Does anyone else have opinions on this?
8	I‚Äôve been married to an INTJ female (I‚Äôm male) for over 14 years and we‚Äôve been a couple for 21 years! You may feel free to ask me anything.
6	Honestly, I guess it's really hard to find INTJs because they're so rare? We're just invisibly drawn to one another. I only did MBTI after we were dating into our 2nd year on a whim. Also made my boyfriend do the same. It wasn't until this sub that I found out how common this pairing was.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt works for my relationship because we're so different in all the right ways. ENFPs are so emotional sometimes, yet rational enough to keep things in perspective. But INTJs are way more rational and logical that they keep us grounded. We provide emotional support to INTJs and can open up a whole new door for them that they otherwise seal up. 
6	There are 4 recharge energies for an ENFP.\n\n* Si > Te > Ni > Fe\n\nThe most important recharge energy is Si, the 2nd most important is Te, so on and so on.\n\nThe 3rd and 4th recharge energies are Ni and Fe.  But it has to be the right Ni and the wrong Ni annoys / frustrates an ENFP, and likewise with Fe where the right Fe recharges the ENFP and the wrong Fe does nothing or can even be counterproductive.\n\nWell an INTJ is good at 2 of these 4 energies of recharge.  Are these the most important energies to recharge this can be argued for all ENFPs need Si recharge energies and some need more of this from their partner and some get it from friends, family, the environment, and via self supply (self supply can't supply Si for long but self supply can integrate Si from multiple sources.)\n\n* So ironically with INTJs the biggest complaint and the biggest appreciation is the INTJ is not energizing the ENFP some of the time but provides other types of energy other times.  Humans beings need energy, we need support, we need appreciation we need connection.  Sometimes INTJs are good and sometimes we are very bad at supporting ENFPs in these things.\n\n* Often when INTJs and ENFPs break up the main reason is the INTJ and ENFP are not being recharged and this frustrates them and either they break up amicably or they break up with passive aggressive / frustration where they feel like their other partner does not get them and they have natural and rational needs and they just do not understand why the partner is not supply the needs especially if the partners intellectually get why these needs are there.  Blah, blah, blah Socionics has stuff on this, google the Mirage / Illusionary relationship type.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOh INTJs can be fun for ENFPs for a whole lot of other reasons besides recharge.  We can be interesting and provide a different but also compatible world view.\n\nWe can have a radical acceptance where we both get the ENFP with us being both _ N _ _ types intuitives in a world that is 75% sensors, and we INTJs also understand the beauty plus the trials and tribulations of Fi and Te.\n\nINTJs and ENFPs intuitively get the other partner, it is a question can they "support / energize / bring the best side out of their partner."  Sometimes this happens and sometimes this doesn't.  There is no perfect / always work compatibility with human relationships, anyone who says there is in fact wishcasting / confabulation.
9	I feel like our types tend to be kind of drawn to each other. I dated an INTJ for 3 years and we had a terrible relationship, but I guess it just depends on what you look for in a partner. My boyfriend now is an ENTP and I feel like we're much better suited for each other than my ex and I were, but I prefer to date extroverts 
5	ENFPs are just INTJs dominated by their feelings.
3	Never dated an ENFP myself but looking back after I found mbti, the girl I crushed on hardest had to be one. Matched that whole bubbly pixie vibe I need to balance me out.
1	I don't know, my ex is an INTJ, and we are still friends. It's unbelievable how well we get along and understand each other.
1	I‚Äôve been dating my INTJ bf for over a year and we were just naturally drawn to each other since we first met and still have sparks but the relationship is a lottt of work because we communicate our feelings and emotions completely different. 
1	As someone out of a relationship with an INTJ, maybe because we never learn our lesson? \nhaha.\nThey're so intense! And take everything seriously. Drives me nuts!!!
65	Hard time making real friends?	Ok, so I don‚Äôt know if this is an ENFP thing or not, or just something that is hard about adulthood in general, or just being a human being?  Wherever I go I seem to be very well liked because I‚Äôm very friendly and (so I‚Äôve been told) bubbly and talkative and funny, and I‚Äôm nice to everyone and make them feel comfortable.  Not loud, just gregarious.  I often get accused of flirting when I‚Äôm just trying to be friendly.  I make friendly acquaintances pretty easily, people like to be around me, but I have such a hard time taking it past that point, to a deeper friendship.  I like people in general, like I see every person as sort of a chocolate with an unknown center and I like learning what makes them special and unique, so in my ideal world, I really would be friends with everyone, the more the merrier.  Needless to say, I found it quite odd when several people this year told me they hate or don‚Äôt like people and will do things to actively avoid them.  I thought they were lying.  Anyhow, I don‚Äôt know how to tell sometimes whether someone sees me as a real friend or not, so I don‚Äôt often reach out to them outside of whatever sphere I know them from (work, school, etc.).  I‚Äôm also afraid of looking needy or clingy.  Growing up I was not popular at all and had a significant amount of anxiety (including social anxiety/shyness) and depression due in large part to that experience.  I was kind of a loner back then, and very quiet, so it came as a shock to me that I tested as an extravert on every single version of Myers-Briggs this year.  I always thought I was an introvert.  Two years ago I finally got my anxiety under control, started going to school again, and worked at Starbucks for awhile.  I couldn‚Äôt believe how much happier I felt doing that and being around new people everyday, everywhere I went, and working with a lot of coworkers.  I would go home happy like my emotional bucket was full.  I think my anxiety had just been making it so that previously being around people had been exhausting and I would seek to be alone to recuperate from nearly having panic attacks.  Anyhow, do any of you have the experience that you‚Äôre very well liked at least on a superficial level and you get a lot of energy and fulfillment being around other people during the day, but then you go home and sometimes you feel sad because you don‚Äôt really have ‚Äúthat person‚Äù you can call at any time or just invite over on a whim?  I‚Äôm single and had gotten used to living alone and thought I liked it.  Then I went on an internship this summer with nine other students, and it was so nice having so many people around all the time.  If you wanted to do something, everyone was just down the hall or a group text away.  Once I moved back home, I decided to get a roommate after realizing how much I liked having people around.  She had told me she was an introvert, but I didn‚Äôt realize she would either never be around (she generally stays at her boyfriend‚Äôs) or that, if she were, she would spend most of her time in her bedroom with the door shut.  All this rambling to say - do any of you have such a craving for human interaction, but still have a hard time finding real, meaningful relationships that go beyond acquaintances?  I think it makes it harder, too, because I have this very childlike personality where I‚Äôm just fascinated by the world when most people my age are kind of jaded.  I‚Äôm 33 and easily get mistaken for someone ten years younger.  I‚Äôm returning to school as a science major, and it seems like the average person wants to talk about football or the Oscars or what so and so did at church on Sunday, and I‚Äôm over here dreaming about quantum mechanics.  I had really developed what I thought was a special work friendship with my chemistry instructor because he would let me talk to him about all these science-y things.  For once I felt like I could breathe because I had someone to get excited with me about these things and I would share articles and books and other things that I found with him.  Then after I wasn‚Äôt in his class anymore, he approached me romantically, which long story short ruined that relationship.  So now...ugh.  I‚Äôm trying to get a chemical engineering degree and am hoping I will feel better surrounded by other nerds that I might have more in common with.  But the loss of that relationship really bummed me out.  Do any of you relate to any of these experiences?
22	Hey girl, I‚Äôm in the same boat. I do have a lot of friends but I don‚Äôt feel like a #1 to anyone. Either because they have SO‚Äôs or for some other reason. It‚Äôs lonely sometimes. I try to put myself out there with meeting new people but rarely does anything go beyond acquaintance-level relationships. \n\nI think you‚Äôre on the right track though ‚Äî finding friends through your daily social circles (school, work, clubs) is much easier than meeting people randomly. I‚Äôm not in school anymore so it‚Äôs hard for me too (24F). I‚Äôm planning to join a volunteer org and a running group to expand my social circles and find people who I have common interests with.  Interested in other comments though!
9	Hey, first I'll say it's hard reading a giant blob paragraph like that. If you don't know you need 2 returns on Reddit to get it to be a new paragraph.\n\nBut yeah I understand. I'm 32 and have no friends. I haven't really since middle school. I've struggled with Social Anxiety Disorder most of my life which kept me from interacting for fear of being disliked and I got panic attacks too. Thankfully like you I am now over that (though I now have general anxiety related to health/death issues etc.) but social-wise I can  talk to people now.\n\nBut I feel like I don't even know how to make friends or how to keep them. I had sort of friends in college because I was involved in Theatre but outside of Theatre stuff and parties I never hung out with anyone as a friend. People would find me fun and funny and would always laugh but if I ever tried to get close to anyone they seemed turned off. They only liked the funny me, not the serious side. Nowadays I only talk to a few of them like a few times a year if that.\n\nIf I ever want to do anything I have to either go with family or go alone. I'm fine with going to some places alone, like the movies, but going bowling or mini gold or other places alone doesn't really sound entertaining. I spend basically every night at home because I have nowhere to go.\n\nBut you are in college again! Seize that opportunity because it is so easy to meet people there compared to out. Join all kinds of clubs, things your interested in, science clubs. Find people with your interested and you should be able to hopefully find friends. Just remember to talk to them and keep them as friends and not let them slip away.
9	Real friends are not created through hanging out or going to dinner. Real friends are created through shared emotional experiences. This is why so many people are in the military and then leave make the statement that the best friends they ever made were from this time in their loves. They faced challenges together. Real life hardship. They bonded.
6	This was like reading my own diary. 
3	You basically just typed the story of my life, lol. Literally everything you said, especially the part where you were talking about being surprised to find you're actually an extrovert, I relate to so much. I wish I had some answers as well. I tried so hard this year to make friends, putting myself out there, etc. But I just never met people I really clicked with. \n\nNew plan is to leave the country and hope I meet some cool, fellow-minded travelers üòÖ 
5	This can definitely be an issue for ENFPs as you all love people (god knows why cuz I‚Äôm one of those ppl who you mentions who avoids ppl on a daily basis lol). \n\nI imagine it like this: ENFPs are like actors and actresses on stage. Everyone loves them because they are entertaining and doesn‚Äôt mind attention. They draw everyone‚Äôs enthusiasm and applause. \n\nHowever after the show is over, how many people would want to actually get to know the actors and actresses on a personal level (besides fan obsession, that doesn‚Äôt count)? \n\nI see ENXPs as performers who are very easy to talk to and be around. They always feel an need to entertain and be loved. In fact, they don‚Äôt like it when their attention is stolen haha. \n\nBut that performance is just a mask. Who can they talk to when they stop entertaining? Many will walk away bc they like the mask, not the person behind the mask. \n\nThe way I see it, if ENFPs want to build more authentic relationships, they must learn some healthy skepticism of human beings and determine who actually likes them for who they are, the quirky, intelligent, morally righteous, somewhat socially awkward, need a sock in the mouth sometimes, annoying and feelings all over the place creature. \n\nIf a person doesn‚Äôt genuinely appreciate these more nuanced aspects of ENFPs, they probably would never be close friends with them. \n\nBesides, for anyone and not just ENFPs, only a few people will become truly close to you. Relationships take time and commitment, and some chance and luck too. So sometimes learn to take it slow and value your worth. Don‚Äôt just give anyone time of the day. 
3	I'm very similar to you, right down to the feeling younger than I am. I'm 39, and right around the time I was 33, I met someone who became my #1 friend...but it was a fairly quick burn and fade. It hurt and caused a lot of anxiety when it faded. We weren't as much of a match as I originally thought.\n\n\nThen another friendship I had at the same time began to gradually grow, and she was my "best friend" for the past four years. It's been beautiful....but.... I can feel it fading as she has met someone who has more opportunity to be in her life more frequently...and the anxiety and hurt I'm feeling! It's on my mind so often, because it was a precious friendship.\n\n\nMy current thoughts on having a #1 friend... don't try to make that designation! Just be good friends with the people that you can be. Friendships will come and go as adults. \n \n\nI found an article the other day, titled Grown Women Don't Need a Best Friend; here's a quote from it: \n\n\n"Psychologists across the board agree that relying on one person to fulfil all your emotional needs is unhealthy;¬†social scientists are even growing sceptical that the ideal of a lifelong monogamous romantic relationship is realistic or healthy. Labelling one friend as ‚Äúthe best‚Äù seems to combine¬†the pressure and commitment of a monogamous relationship with few of the benefits.¬†‚ÄúBecause these relationships are very intense (in a non-sexual way), they are also very fragile,‚Äù said Dunbar. ‚ÄúWhen they bust, they bust forever and acrimoniously.‚Äù¬†\n\n\nHaving one all-consuming best friend may be more appropriate for children, who don‚Äôt have the distraction of adult responsibilities and haven‚Äôt had many opportunities to meet a range of people, than for adults."\n\n\n\n
3	You guys....I did not think I would get this many comments.  0_o  I thought I was just kind of tossing this out into the universe.
1	Hi fellow ENFP!\nApart from being a boy who is 10 years younger than you and not having had any experience working where you get to interact with new people everyday, this PERFECTLY describes me! (I LOVE QUANTUM MECHANICS AND USED TO ANNOY MY 8TH GRADE TEACHER BY FLOODING HER EMAIL WITH SCIENCE-Y ARTICLES! NO KIDDING! I would still do that given I had someone to actually send those articles to!) \n\nWhen you said "and here I am dreaming about quantum mechanics", I thought maybe it was me writing from a parallel universe! And something similar to what you described about your friendship with that chap has happened to me too! I liked a girl in one of my past social circles, who would portray herself as a physics enthusiast, but it turned out that it was very superficial and she wasn't actually interested in physics and was just trying to mess around.\n\nFeel free to message me!
2	Well, yes, making real friends is really hard, for me as well. \n\nI love being around people, sometimes just observing, sometimes talking but not talking about everything. Here is true whats said that I love talking about experiences, ideas, I love when people are talking about themselves because I can see the uniqueness. Maybe thats why lot of people are seeing me as their friend that I can listen and I dont gossip about them. But there is the other side as well - almost n oone is ever asking about me, or listens to me or cares what I want/need to say. And thats when I know it looks like it wont be true deep friendship.\n\nSometimes Im behaving totally as introvert when Im around people, because I just observe etc and then I talk. Mostly Im not talking because I dont know what to say to the certain topic not because I dont want to say anything but I have either very rich internal dialogue with myself or Im just bored and I find the discussed topic stupid (so I switch to internal dialogue and all the 935795830989 possibilities and ideas going through my mind.) Most of the time I talk a lot, Im funny and I have good sense of humour, can talk about everything from cosmetics to technology because I have very huge general knowledge. So I think 95% people (5% are women who think Im flirting with their boyfriends when Im not or just hate me because I can eat whole burger menu with chips and not gain a gram of fat LOL) are glad that Im around them but almost none of them know me truly or who I truly am. Its partly because I hardly share my internal world to random people and Im not that kind of person as some of my friends, mostly girls, meeting new person and being best friends right away.  I realised that when we had Secret Santa at work and my Secret Santa struggled about tailored gift for me because he asked like 15 people Im spending time with even outside the work like going to a pub or doing some sport and they are basically friends and no one could advise him a thing - even such a thing if I watch Game of Thrones or not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	Haha, you write well and clearly, just as mentioned before it is one big blob. Still like I said there is a clear structure, so the only thing missing is physical representations of that structure: white lines.\n\n\nYou are struggling with making it real yourself. Very relatable.\n\n\nYou have rightfully mentioned that a lot of people seem to like you, it is true, you probably are a chill person to talk to. \n\n\nThere is, as you have observer, however, a difference between a chill person you talk to and a friend. This is not universal though. Some people I know see all those people they talk to as friends, while I only consider about 7 people to be my friends. \n\n\nIf you want to be friends, it is like asking someone out in a way I feel like. It is less scary (for me) because there are less feelings involved, but in a way it is the same. At some point you have to ask them whether they want to move on from the we just talk to we'll go for friends and see what happens phase. \n\n\nOf course you don't have to ask them directly, though that is of course a possibility if it feels good to ask that. Do where your intuition leads you, it is usually right and if it's wrong you know it probably wouldn't have worked anyway.\n\n\nI remember one of my oldest friends in particular. We used to talk during the breaks and fuck around a bit (figuratively) during class, but never really did anything outside of school. Eventually, when i wanted to change that, I asked him out on a date (not literally); he liked cars so I asked whether he wanted to join me to a oldtimer museum. From that point doing things together became normal and in no time we were friends.\n\n\nAnother example is one of my other very good friends. With him it was very easy. We had never really talked but we had a mutual good friend and I like something about him. So eventually I randomly texted him; do you wanna chill? he said yes and 2 days later we were chilling almost every night. He is ESFP so that may explain the easiness haha.\n\n\nLastly, even with introverted shyer people this can work. I had been talking to a girl next to me in class for a semester, and eventually she asked me: "what will you be doing tonight", in which I sensed that she meant more and actually wanted to do something, so I responded: "same as you haha".\n\n\nFrom that point it became normal to just ask each other out and to do things, to have fun and talk like friends.\n\n\nI know the struggle, even though I am writing this here I also still go through it pretty often, but in the end it is really quite simple. Especially for someone like us who is generally well liked (because we are, and you are too).\n\n\nIt is really mostly about taking that leap, jumping over the wall, or however you'd like to call it.\n\n\nCommitment is scary, especially in romantic relationships, but also in friendly ones. It is funny how many parallels there are between the two.\n
1	oof! I've been that yo
1	I have a similar vibe. I‚Äôm married to an introvert who *does* want to be around me, so that helps a lot. But most of my other friends are just acquaintances.\n\nMy closest friends live in other cities, but they‚Äôre people I was creatively fulfilled with. We made music, movies, etc on our own time, got real stressed, or were in minor danger (running out of gas at 2am on a mountain...camping in a lightning storm)... and bonded like crazy because of it. However, our whole friendship is kinda based on making, so we drift apart if we‚Äôre not working on stuff together. \n\nYou know what my biggest problem is though? When I get close with new people, *I‚Äôm* the one who ends up feeling crowded. Someone will want to get close, invite me to hang all the time... and it‚Äôll freak me out. It starts to feel like they want too much commitment from me, and my very limited time isn‚Äôt being spent on anything else. So I end up pushing them away in one way or another.\n\nI try to be up front about it at this point, actually. But I can still tell that it bums people out. \n\nSounds like you had something similar happen with dude approaching you romantically. The same sort of thing can happen with friends, kind of. They want to be *best friends*, and that shit freaks me out.
1	As with all the others, this is very relatable.\n\nI spoke to an INTP about making friends recently (we are both late 20s) and I was surprised at first because he had come across so extroverted in the first week of our teacher training course. It turned out that he had just been extraverted like that until he made some friends he thought were good enough. After that he literally made zero effort with new people. But he now has a group of 3 very good friends from the course and they hang out most evenings.\n\nAnd the final very ENFP thing: we made a podcast together about learning to teach, it's called student teachers anonymous, it's on Spotify if you're interested/thinking about another change in career ! Haha.
1	I almost made a post like this a week ago, but more about how to make friends.\n\nLike everyone who replied, it is pretty true.\n\nAlthough my problem is not just finding real friends, but even finding people who actually wants to hang out with me.\n\nI‚Äôm in my early 30s and I realized that I don‚Äôt know how to get people to want to talking to me. I guess I had crippling social anxiety that hindered me from learning how to make friends. I just remember every time I try to make new friends in college, once I get the vibe that people don‚Äôt want to talk to me, I totally shut down. It‚Äôs not a good feeling when you realize someone isn‚Äôt interested in getting to know you. Everyone else seem to have a easy time making friends.\n\nAnother difference is that I have a best friend and 2 other good friends (I think?), but they‚Äôre long distance. I don‚Äôt have anyone near me except my family and my boyfriend. My boyfriend games most of the time, and he doesn‚Äôt necessarily understand my need to go out all the time. He‚Äôs suppose to be an extrovert, but he enjoys staying home playing video games. He doesn‚Äôt hangout with his friends either. He doesn‚Äôt see the point in hanging out with people, nor does he want to talk to them in person.\n\nWhat I notice is that all the people I know have friends who would text them on a regular basis (including my boyfriend). Whereas for me there may be days where I don‚Äôt get a single text. My best friend and one of my good friend is in a group chat together with one other person, and I recently realized we don‚Äôt have a group chat together. I don‚Äôt have a group chat with anyone. \n\nI think my social anxiety has gotten better, but it still hinders me from understanding the mechanics behind making friends, and being my complete self. It gets really bad at work too. Originally I thought I had work friends, but last year I felt that one of them didn‚Äôt like me, so I decided to distance myself from the group. When I distanced myself, no one cared to talk to me or have lunch with me anymore. I was completely alone. It really sucks especially because I enjoy being with people. \n\nI kinda wish I knew how to get people to like me, so I can get some friends who would actually want to text and hangout with me. Maybe I‚Äôm just not an interesting person.\n \nI know it sounds like I don‚Äôt do any of the leg work to reach out to people and I want people to reach out to me, but it‚Äôs not true. I spend 99% reaching out to people and asking them to have dinner or hang out. The people I‚Äôve reached out to never reach out to me. Majority of the time its been one-sided, and I‚Äôm kind of fed up. 
6	Every time...	Sat at the dinner table with family...everyone has given their opinion on current topic. I have been supporting throughout.\n\nFamily member: "Hey, what do you think about it Ozy?"\n\nMe: \*Stomach tightens\* \*constant need to clear throat\* \*minds blanks\* \*Says whatever nonsense comes into head in random flow of consciousness which meanders into various other topics.\*\n\nFamily member: Right...Anyway, did anyone see the game today? \n\nMe: \*Whay am I like this?\* 
2	Why do you feel such pressure? Can't you just say "I don't know."?

2	Shit, here goes another rabbit-hole dive.
8	How to get better at taking criticism?	
5	Hi. I have never really cared what anyone thought of me. Though at the same time I did because I had social anxiety. It's hard to explain. But I guess I mean I have never been offended or hurt by what someone has said. I take criticism as helpful. In fact I welcome it. I prefer that to white lies. If I am bad at something I want to know it and I want to know all the specifics of how I am bad. That's the only way I'll know what I'm bad at so I can improve. Am I bad at sex? Tell me! Bad at working? Tell me! Bad at talking? Tell me!\n\nWhat you need to realize is criticism, whether constructive or not, can only help you. It allows you to grow. Take it as fuel to get greater. If what they say isn't true however then don't worry, it's a lie and you know it. If it is true then don't worry, it's something you can work on.
4	Hi I‚Äôm an INFJ but I also find criticism to be debilitating. I listened to a podcast once about tricking your brain to be REALLY FUCKING EXCITED about the opportunity to improve a process every time you receive criticism. Then after you‚Äôve objectively turned the criticism over In your head a few times, you can rationally examine your behavior patterns. Sometimes your original process wasn‚Äôt flawed at all but I do think it‚Äôs important to always be open to criticism. Otherwise, you‚Äôre surrounded by people who always agree with you and no one is pushing you to grow. 
3	Be ready to listen and ready to change. We take criticism badly because it feels like a jab to the ego. It's uncomfortable to own your weakness especially in front of others. Get through the initial reaction first before able to consider their points. Sometimes even your worst enemies can give a valid critique.
2	I appreciate that you're making an effort and I will therefore try to provide a good answer\n\nIn order to take and give criticism honestly, you must try to detatch from your emotions and categorize objective and subjective into two different groups. Observe your emotions and values from a third perspective and whenever your anger boils up, remind yourself to put the subjective and objective into two different groups and observe the criticism from a third perspective where you extract the objective information to reinforce yourself and leave out the emotion/subject. This wont be as effective but if you really dont want to do that, allow yourself to become mad or upset, but slowly try to wind down so you can become more receptive to criticism and separate criticism from harrasment 
1	I don‚Äôt know if I ever developed a skill at taking criticism. I think a lot had to do with the attitude of the person giving the criticism. Like, if they would be angry or upset if I didn‚Äôt do what they suggested, that would make me more inclined to not accept it. Probably not the healthiest attitude on my part!
1	It‚Äôs important to care about others peoples feelings but not their opinions. Also you do not have to be liked to be loved.
1	When I was younger I recognized that people who give criticism only want to see me improve. They are not trying to be mean, or bring you down. They just want to see you progress, and are willing to invest some effort to tell you how you can

30	Shutting people off	I'm in a period where i am shutting a lot of people off. People trxt me and i takes me a day to respond, cause I don't care for some reason. I am not sure why that is. Do you guys experience similar periods of time?
17	We are too busy being stuck in our own reality and communicating with others often disturbs that delicate conceptualization that we have set for ourselves. \nThis is merely a primitive defense mechanism in order to accommodate that. Realizing certain things make us more upset in general and hence we tend to avoid it subconsciously as much as we can . \nHowever that does not mean that we cannot handle such realities when we have to, we just choose not to whenever it is possible.\n
3	All. The. Time! Most know now to only text me to make sure I'm informed about something but don't really expect me to text back. 
2	I've been isolating myself recently as well. I just can't work up the energy needed to interact with normal people, and I don't really have friends in my area anymore. It sucks so much üòû
1	Is this a common thing to do? I‚Äôve been seeing a girl recently and she just feels so distant all the time, it feels one sided and I really don‚Äôt know if she just doesn‚Äôt care or is this the case?
1	I'm feeling this right now. It's kinda like I just snapped. I'm not concerned with caring about others or being anyone's sounding board. I couldn't care less about other people's ish, when I would normally be stressing over it. Though, I know in a few days or a week, I'll be right back at it. 
1	Sometimes i need to withdraw to process stressful things. Other times it‚Äôs because i‚Äôm feeling depressed.

2	Something I noticed these past couple years and only realized this last NYE: for an extrovert, I've really been feeling introverted at events/parties/going out. I used to be extremely outgoing. I wasn't the life of the party or anything, but I'd introduce myself to strangers easily or go out of my way to include the introverts at parties in fun drinking games or whatever. My acquaintances liked having me at parties because they could count on me to get everyone involved and having fun. Now, I can't be bothered and I just stick to the people I know. I'm not rude and I'll be conversational back if someone approached me, but I feel like parties are so draining now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI still enjoy going to shows, music festivals, and the like, but I feel like I have to recharge longer. I don't have the motivation to go out as crazy often as I used to. I used to love the company of others but now I'm just happy with my circle. I went to an acquaintance's party recently and I didn't know anybody. Old me wouldn't find this to be a problem and just inserted myself wherever. Instead, my social skills (in a party setting) are diminished, I felt, in comparison to Old Me. I find it extremely easy to talk to strangers still, but in an event with my peers, it's all kind of awkward and weird. I feel a bit sad thinking about this. I still go out to shows, but halfway through, I'm like "I can't wait to go home and just watch Netflix." Is this normal for an ENFP??
10	Married ENFP with really conflicted feelings ‚Äì help!	Here's a bullet point version of my problem so it's easy to read!\n\n* I'm a female ENFP (34) married to a male INFJ (38), together 14 years, married for nearly 8 years. On the most part, have been really happy. But for the last 4 years, since having a child together, I've been having completely conflicted feelings.\n* I'm sure this is because by having a child we've felt less connected to each other, I've had less time alone which has made me anxious, and parts of me just don't feel as strongly attracted to my partner anymore.\n* I am wanting to be married but also wanting to be single. Wanting to have a bigger family, but also not wanting to have any more (we have one child already, but fearing having more incase it makes this confused feeling even worse).\n* Oftentimes I feel I'd be happier living on my own. My partner does EVERYTHING for me so I can concentrate on my career (I know, wtf am I complaining about right?), which is amazing but it makes me feel like I have little control of my life. When he's away, it's more difficult to juggle the every day but I feel more in control and happier.\n* I've had rare occasions where I've felt strong sparks/connection with other people, probably INTJ/INFJ types. And though it's never been acted on, it makes me fear there's something wrong with my marriage. I often can't stop thinking about them. Has anyone ever felt this?\n* I feel scared that, though my marriage is everything anyone would want, there is something missing now and I don't know what to do. Why on earth would I break up everything just for a niggling feeling with NO solid reason?\n* I've read us ENFPs find it really hard to leave relationships, and it's true but even more so for me because my partner has done NOTHING WRONG. In fact, he's become more supportive and incredible over the years. But it doesn't stop my feelings of numbness towards our marriage.\n\nWHAT DO I DO >\_<
17	I‚Äôm an INFP not an ENFP but I know we are similar in a lot of ways. \n\nTalk. To. Him. \n\nThis goes for any marriage but especially one where the one you want to leave hasn‚Äôt even done anything. Marriages are about sharing everything with one another. And I don‚Äôt mean for this to come across as rude, but I know it will because I‚Äôm sensitive to criticism as well, you sound very selfish. Take some time to reconsider your morality. How would you feel if your husband felt trapped because you had a child and was thinking about other women he‚Äôs connected with? All the while you‚Äôre working full time to support him... \n\nINFJs are problem solvers. Talk to him about how you‚Äôve been feeling. If you can tell the whole internet then you can tell the love of your life. Both ENFPs and INFPs are prone to getting stir crazy and wanting to experience all that they can. and see life as a big adventure. But I normally get out of this mind space by talking about it with the people I care for and realizing how silly my imagination can be sometimes. 
7	Sigh I understand this problem (I think I understand it, maybe I am projecting here.)  But you are describing a trap that often happens with ENFP and IN_Js, and there are slightly different versions of this trap with ENFP and INTJ and ENFP and INFJ.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n^(I hope my response will be helpful but I have no clue how to articulate this into words, feels, memories, lived experiences, visual examples and diagrams, are in my mind but trying to articulate this into words is hard.  It feels like someone chopped off my heads and my instinct is to draw, or to point, not to say things with words.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEverything works at a ***distance***.\n\nIt seems ideal, it seems great, but there is no **synchronicity** at a *CLOSE* range.\n\nYour partner can't be a useful helpmate that energizes you.  Your partner can be extremely helpful but they are helpful by doing things on their own and then bringing the labors to you.  You by contrast are either feeling unable to do things (for you need some extrovert energy to start things off) or you are energized but you are not synchronized for you are giving things, data, sensations, but not anything you can work with that works towards your strengths.\n\nThis in turn makes you feel like you are all thumbs.\n\nYou feel like you are not really in your body, like you are there but it is not there, it feels like you are wearing a mask and living someone else's life.  It can be a good life this someone else life but it is not you.  You feel alone in a crowd, you feel all on your own, even though your partner is right there.\n\nYou feel a mismatch with you and the environment, even though you love your partner, the environment is off.  The environment is a "Space" that is both already existing there, but also co-created by the multiple people who inhabit the space and change the space itself but also change the energy in the room.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGood Luck, but understand you are not alone for what you are describing is a common thing with ENFPs and IN_Js (of both types ENFP and INTJ and ENFP and INFJs.)  People have found solutions to these problems, but finding the solution that works best for you will require you learning about 5 different couples and taking A from couple 1, B from couple 2, skip couple 3, take C and D from couple 4, and couple 5 will not add anything directly but the insights help you create your own combination of things, your own story, your own solution, your own **more perfect** harmony. (As in the idiom "A More Perfect Union" in the preamble of the US Constitution.)
7	Communication is key in this moment, not just with ENFPs but all personality types. Things won‚Äôt get better until you guys talk. Explain all those complicated feelings. Have him tell you what he is feeling. Find ways to take time for yourself and for each other. 
3	Couples counseling and/or individual counseling
3	This is really common amongst all the types, but I think especially for ENFPs. We like our options. I don‚Äôt know about you, but I love the infatuation stage of relationships. That phase of relationships is very unstable, and instability equals excitement. With ENFPs there is a constant tug of war between excitement/the unknown(in general) and stability. Inferior Si is a biatch. I echo what others have said; talk to your spouse about this. Find ways to invest in yourselves again; keep doing new things together even though you have a child. Find hobbies of your own so that you have new exciting things to talk about 
3	\nTalk to him. Tell him everything you've told us. Literally everything and more. Communication is everything. Maybe he is feeling the same. Maybe not but you can work on solutions together, for example giving you more independence and allowing you to do more things for your own life. And taking more time alone just you two without the kid.
3	So MBTI is a thing based off Carl Jung which said humans do 8 things, whe broke down in 4 categories and 2 different styles in each category.\n\nWe do\n\n* Initution (Pattern Recognition) and\n\n* Sensing\n\nWith these 2 categories taking in information.\n\nAnd we also do 2 categories of organizing information\n\n* Feeling (assigning value)\n\n* Thinking (organizing around value for we have multiple values.)\n\nAnd with each of those 4 categories we do two different styles, an expansive style which is extroverted, and an internalizing style which is introverted.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe in MBTI (and its cousin system Socionics) with acronyms\n\n* Ne, extroverted intuition\n\n* Ni, introverted intuition\n\n* Se, extroverted sensing\n\n* Si, introverted sensing\n\n* Fe, extroverted feeling\n\n* Fi, introverted feeling\n\n* Te, extroverted thinking\n\n* Ti, introverted thinking.\n\nCarl Jung says all humans use all 8 cognitive functions (we call now them 8 jungian cognitive functions now a days.)\n\n**But** even though all humans use all 8 functions, we have a preference, a default with 4 of these functions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Later on two school teachers created MBTI which is the order of these 4 functions that you value.  There are 16 different types based off the order of your 4 valued functions  This is how Myer Briggs started based off the work of Isabella Myers and her mother Katherine Cook Briggs. \n\n* Socionics is an independent developed system that also has 16 types based off Carl Jung.  But while MBTI was developed in the US and Western Europe, Socionics was developed in the USSR and Eastern Europe based off the same thing.  Even though these systems are different they are highly compatible if you know the ins and outs of both systems but to beginners it is best to learn MBTI and only after learning in deep learn how Socionics is similar but slightly disagreements.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo ENFP 4 valued functions are\n\n* Ne-Fi-Te-Si\n\nSo INFJ 4 valued functions are \n\n* Ni-Fi-Ti-Se\n\nNotice the pattern?\n\n* Intuition is strongest for both the EN_Ps and IN_Js.\n\n* Feeling is 2nd strongest for both ExFPs and I_FJs\n\n* Thinking is 3rd strongest (start to become weak) for both E_FPs and I_FJs\n\n* Sensing is the weakest of the valued functions for both EN_Ps and IN_Js\n\nBut between ENFPs and INFJ different styles / directions of extroversion and introversion energy is prefered.  Ne vs Ni, Fe vs Fi, Te vs Ti, Se and Si.\n\nSo lets think of those 8 functions as questions, what are the 8 questions?\n\nLists the order of the INFJ asking the 8 questions\n\n#[Click this Image](https://i0.wp.com/www.psychologyjunkie.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/INFJ-Functions-with-Shadow.jpg?w=841&ssl=1)\n\nThe 8 questions are the same regardless of your type but with ENFP flip the order of the table in the image so the right column is your main way of asking and the left column is the ENFP's shadow.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo you also use 4 other functions, so with\n\nENFP your shadow / subdued functions are\n\n* Ni-Fe-Ti-Se\n\nINFJ your shadow / subdued function are\n\n* Ne-Fi-Te-Se\n\nNotice the order is switched between ENFP and INFJ.  Also notice the order of your shadow functions follow the same N, F, T, S pattern but the orientation of these elements are different?\n\nYou use your shadow functions all the time, but they are often subdued and only provide feedback / point of view shifts when the main 4 functions can't solve the problem. They are used in the middle of solving the problem (they temporary activate) and then become subdued / shadow once they are no longer needed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI got more to say, but this is a good stop place for the other stuff to say is related but is a pivot towards a different thing.  It is talking about things that an ENFP needs to remain energized, the things an INFJ needs to remain energized, and relationship pitfalls between the ENFP and INFJ (note in theory all of the types have relationship pitfalls, all relationships with MBTI / Socionics have some things that are easy and some things that are harder due to functions interplay between two people, ***how you respond to these things*** determines ultimate compatibility not your MBTI letters.)\n\nBut before I forget I recommend you buy these two books.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Was-That-Really-Me-Personality/dp/0891061703\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-ENFP-Survival-Guide-ebook/dp/B012DP87ZO
2	I once read that if youre feeling smtg weird in your marriage, the best person to talk to is your partner. Not other people. So maybe both of you can start talking about this.
3	To be honest, it sounds like you want to leave. But you said you had a child recently? That‚Äôs changes things a lot- it changes the whole dynamic of your relationship. \n\nI‚Äôm not going to delve into any other areas you wrote about because I haven‚Äôt been with you for 14 years like your SO has. There can be a lot of history or deep feelings that can affect your relationship.\n\nI agree with others, you both need to talk. But take it a step further. I HIGHLY suggest marriage counseling. You need to both make your feelings heard with a third unbiased and professional person there to help. You may find that you two should part ways, or you two might find that you want to stay, and a marriage counselor can help you with the tools to do that.
1	I have the suspicion that you are simply bored with the relationship because he is too nice. You need a little less hot and a bit more cold. I guess that's a problem with ENFPs committing. Marriage is bound&safe but ENFPs oftentimes have some shitty seed of "if it's too easy I'm not interested" and that's a not really what you need in a marriage.
10	Uncomfortable Flirts about Appearance.	Recently someone has been flirting with me (which is nice) but its always about my looks and nothing about my personality or accomplishments and such. For some reason it makes me really uncomfortable. I don't mind being told I'm a good looking person (I enjoy it a lot!) but when its over and over it just feels so halo and fake as if they like the surface me and not bothering to try and see who I really am. \n\nI figure its more they are still young (there is a 10 year age difference) and not use to flirty or these flirt tactics are what has worked in the past. Or maybe I'm the weird one. I don't know. \n\nDo you guys ever feel the uncomfortable when someone only complements you only on your looks? \n\n
5	No. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm uncomfortable with it, but I know exactly what you‚Äôre talking about. \n\nAll you have to do is say, ‚Äúthank you‚Äù and then you keep doing you. \n\n
3	Some people can only think of compliments based on looks. They may like your personality but don't know how to compliment you on it.
3	It feels so much more incredible when you get complimented on your personality or the things you are achieving or are proud of. \n\nI had an ex really notice things about myself and told me about it. E.g. she told me she was drawn to me because I show kindness to those who might not feel much love in this world. It meant so much to me. 
4	I‚Äôve been married for almost 15 years. I tell my wife that it wouldn‚Äôt hurt if she objectified me a little. \n\nSo no, sorry OP! I‚Äôm also male, though, so I don‚Äôt get looks compliments in general. 
2	My husband used to do this when we first got together. I knew he also liked my personality though because of the way he‚Äôd look at me when I‚Äôd say certain things. I think it was harder to verbalize those non appearance admirations though (he‚Äôs an ESFJ...makes sense to me, as Ti is their inferior and Te is practically nonexistent if not the demon function). Anyways, we just had a chat about it and I‚Äôm fine with quality rather than quantity of complements. He told me once that he believes I‚Äôll have a successful career and that I‚Äôll write a book one day. Seriously best compliment ever. Perhaps confront this person? Not sure their type, but being direct gets results most of the time.
2	my ENTJ partner used to do that and he is 9 years older than me, so i don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs an age thing. i was going through a crisis at a time and it was hard to articulate myself as to why constant compliments like this it made me feel like you described. i just kept addressing it until he got it, since it‚Äôs not like he meant to make me feel this way.
1	My ex (INTJ) used to do the same thing. I don't think he meant it in a way that he didn't think I was smart or funny or interesting, but it definitely came across how you describe and the shallowness actually kinda hurt after a while. He knew I felt insecure and was just trying to help, but couldn't really understand that it wasn't my appearance I was insecure about - it was the fact that no one really recognized how capable I am of accomplishing things and taking care of myself. \n\nI really hate it when guys approach me like this nowadays. If they seem otherwise cool I'll let it slide, but it's a strike against them tbh, especially as an opener. I already know I'm cute. Say something that shows me you're actually an intelligent and observant person, not just a Neanderthal trying to get laid. \n\nMaybe that's a bit harsh but I don't really care  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
1	I don‚Äôt think they only like you for your looks.\n\nThink of it this way: is it ever easy for YOU to compliment someone you care about?\n\nI know I can‚Äôt, and I like seeing things from both perspectives.
3	Getting out of Ne-Te fruit l00ps and developing Fi	I have been trying to figure out my type for a very long time. Quite sure about having Fi-Te, Ne-Si in the first four of my stack but not sure about their order... Until I stumbled upon this podcast on cognitive function loops (link: [https://goo.gl/XS14pE](https://goo.gl/XS14pE)) and the possibility of being an ENFP started to make a lot more sense because of Ne-Te loop.\n\nWhen I looked closely (skimming through, more like, haha coz I am shit at chronology) at the timeline starting from my childhood years up until this very moment in young adulthood, I saw patterns of myself "being too occupied with things" at every stage. I have always been the active kid in school: always involved in some sort of project, student leadership, always 'excelling' and this carried on into my university years.\n\nI guess when you're in school, nobody would scold you for being too busy, as long as you do great at academics and stayaway from delinquency lol. But when you're older, priorities change, your life expand to include other aspects into it as well. Busyness began to affect myself and also my relationships. Friends and family have raised their concerns for me at different points, common complain being that I don't care about spending them with them anymore or that I'll burn out. Of course, I dismissed them all because I didn't find it to be a problem to be busy 'pursuing good things' (I was very much into student activism) and they're being way too clingy about it. When a close friend confronted me by saying that "I am just keeping occupied because I want to fill the emptiness of my heart", I was very offended.\n\nI'm typing this rn in agreement with her, months after that confrontation, while laughing at my own oblivion and ignorance. She was right. I can usually tell bullsh\*t from afar but I was blind to my own. Life has definitely slowed down after I graduated last summer, now I have the time to properly think about my life and where I would like to head towards. I also have more time to catch up with people, which was sobering because I discovered how much I've missed out on the lives of those whom I claim to care about. I find that I struggle the most in times like this, when I have the time to feel what I feel and question myself deeply. Some days I'd feel anxious and restless for no reason but I sat the f\*ck down anyway and told myself that it's crucial for me go through this.\n\nOK I typed a lot of stuff here, grats for even reaching this paragraph. Hope you could see the Ne-Te loop in my description, more importantly I hope I didn't perceive things wrongly >.< Can anyone confirm if this is Ne-Te loop and does anyone relate to this? If you do, any tips on how to NOT fall into the loop and make better decisions as ENFP?
2	So with ENFP\n\nThink of your functions like this\n\n* Ne and Si are "accepting" traits, they exist independently from the enviroment, they are thus more stable sometimes called "fixed."  Some descriptions call this the spine of the personality with a head and root components.\n\n* Fi and Te are both "producing traits" they interact with the enviroment more and thus are "dependent" on the enviroment, they are "variable" with the enviroment.  Some call this the hands+arms of the personality.  With a dominant hand being one of the auxillary function and the secondary hand being the tetriarty function.\n\nThis next part is important and confusing are we stronger with our auxillary or tetriary function is a matter up to debate and this goes back to Jung, Myers, and Harold Grant (Calling ENFPs Ne-Fi-Te-Si is Grant termiology while other methods may call ENFPs Ne-Te-Fi-Si notice the same 4 functions but what is the auxillary bs 2nd auxillary also known as tetriary is different.)\n\nMore info on the previous paragraph is located here https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/50dg6f/overview_of_popular_function_models/\n\nWarning that is Mordor (Ti) you are walking into ;-)\n\nSo why is there disagreement between Grant and Jung with calling ENFPs Ne-Fi vs Ne-Te?  Well do you order by strength or ego preference.  Grant order by strength for ENFPs are stronger at Fi vs Te, while Jung says Te as 2nd function for the Ego preference is Ne and thus another extroverted function is Te even though ENFPs are stronger at Fi and using Fi instead of Te providing carthatic relief on complex task but on simple tasks an ENFP rather use Ne+Te.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAn ENFP in an Ne+Te loop looks to **external** people like they are maniac or in a form of hyperactive adhd.\n\nThey need to use Fi to priortize and Si to 1) keep your self regulatory energy in the golden zone and 2) to not burn out to practice self care, to refuel one self energy, to relax and take care of one self.\n
18	Money	I don't know if it's just me but does any one else feel like they spend money a bit wildly, almost in a whim. it's like "ah, life is short" üòÇ and if anyone has any suggestions for what works for you while saving cash feel free to advise. Tryna be present more so I spend and invest wisely. Is this it? 
8	I feel like that so I have a auto transfer set up to my savings right after I get paid. So anything left in my checking after bills is fun money. 
8	From one ENFP to another, this is what works and what doesn't work, for me.\n\nWhat didn't work: berating myself for being a spendthrift, draconian rules and resolutions, having money sitting around burning a hole in my pocket.\n\nWhat worked:  Give every dollar a PURPOSE! This way, instead of a generic dead piece of paper that can be swapped for all those colorful baubles, it's your morocco street food tour fund! Who knows if you'll even end up going to Morocco. Maybe, as you save up for it, you'll become fascinated with Iceland instead, and it'll become your Indie Music and Geysers tour of Iceland fund. Or maybe your car will break down and you're just grateful of that extra 2k in your bank account that just saved your ass. \n\nI don't think ENFPs are very materialistic. When we overspend, it's usually because we are caught up in the possibilities of something in the moment. Rather than going against our instincts, why not embrace it? Instead of spending wildly and whimsically, set your wild and whimsical goals. So much of the enjoyment is in the planning and plotting anyhow. \n\nIn terms of logistics, I recommend the app Everydollar, which has a free basic version that should be everything you need. An even simpler version would be to get envelops and writing your goals on them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n 
3	Not too long ago I've purchased a small cheap cactus, cause I was chatting with someone about it. I sometimes spend on a whim, but mostly trying to work financially towards a goal.
4	Oh my god I have such an issue with spending! I now have a huge student loan that I really dont want to be stuck with for too long, so in July, I bought a can money box (money box that can only be opened by a can opener) for about a euro or so. I think most pound shops have them or Im sure theyre readily available online for a small fee. Anyway, whenever I broke notes, had coins or was gifted with money I wouldnt otherwise have, I put it into the money box. I decided to open the box a few days ago and really wasnt expecting much because I didnt feel like I had been saving too often and my spending habits have been just as bad since July. To my surprise I had nearly 1100‚Ç¨ saved. This has motivated me to genuinely try to save more frequently if this is the end bonus! It also made me think about what kind of shit I would have spent this money on the last few months if I hadnt been saving the odd bit of cash here and there. I am definitely going to get another box for the New Year. This sounds like the simplest thing ever but it really worked for me, hope it helps! 
17	You are not a loser.	
8	You are a Guardian of the Galaxy.
6	Losing in itself is a construct invented by man, as is winning as well, so essentially, are we just doers? 
4	I'm ok with losing because wining isn't everything. I'm just happy knowing I am a participant in this game of life and try to enjoy it as much as I can before getting kicked off the board. 
1	why?
1	wrong
69	Just Bought "The ENFP Survival Guide"	I've heard great things and the Amazon reviews are exceptional. I re-took the personality test just to make sure I was still ENFP, and I resonate with many of the posts here so it's safe to say I'm an ENFP. \n\nAnyone else read it? What did you think? 
22	Definetely loved it!! Helped me to finally understand cognitive functions and made me feel that much comfortable with myself
9	Been interested in buying the book for a while, keen to hear if it's worth it :)
8	I really liked it. It made me understand parts of myself that I thought were weird or even wrong. I was able to embrace those sometimes contradictory facts about myself and have a clearer picture of who I am.
14	I will not say anything for when I say any praises to \n\n* 1) either ENFPs\n\n* 2) or products created by ENFPs\n\n**all that praise** *goes to you gals and guy's heads*.  If I can't say anything (for it will be praise) I will keep my mouth shut üòâ\n\n^(*Yes this is INTJ humor =P*)
6	Absolute essential book for an ENFP! Learn the cognitive functions in depth, understand your strengths and weaknesses, examine your behavior while depressed, etc. Life changing book :)
4	Recently read this!  Been switching career paths, jumping from one project to the next, and all around a total scatter brain, but the book made me realize that's all part of the fun!!!  Very glad to learn that my Si function will develop in my 30s, and until then may as well enjoy the ride!
3	I thought it was short and was mostly repetitive - but its been a while since I read it so my memory is vague.  \n\n\nI guess other people found it helpful, but I understood the MBTI and ENFP pretty thoroughly so it felt like a beginner's book and I was at an intermeditate level.
3	I LOVE this book! And it's written by an ENFP. It has us nailed! You'll love it. 
2	Is it also critical? It seems interesting, but I want to be sure it also talks about negative aspects of ENFP. 
2	Yes I just read it twice through and I have never felt like I understood myself so well. I think I've always had trouble understanding why I felt so different than other people or constantly conflicted or bored. This was so assuring that this is normal and I'm not going crazy or something! Haha!
1	I love that book! Highly Recommend to all ENFPs.

43	Me showing my friends the 101st new thing I'm excited about	
1	Lmao happy i just watched that scene
1	100% me. I always joke that I love forcing my interests on people  
1	Sooooo true. And then I try to talk myself into holding back from sharing the next thing
3	Do ENFPs love New Year's Eve?	It's hard to explain, but I just find NYE to be such a nice, nostalgic time... I can look back through the years and remember where I was and what I was doing for almost all of them. Like markers throughout my life. Most people I know just see it as any other party/night out, but it holds real importance for me. \n\nI'm a generally nostalgic and sentimental person anyway which I think are ENFP traits. Anyone else feel the same way?\n\nHappy New Year of course!
9	Nope, fuck it. It always reminds me of lonely I am, it's just a shit day imo
2	Translates the 300 year old Scot to more "present" English\n\nTransliteral this scottish song means Old Long Ago but a figurative / metaphorical meaning could also be  "old long since",  "long long ago" "days gone by", or "old times". \n\n#Auld Lang Syne\n\nShould old acquaintance be forgot, \n\n* and never brought to mind? \n\nShould old acquaintance be forgot, \n\n* and old lang syne^(old long ago)?\n\n>CHORUS\n\n>For old lang syne^(old long ago), my dear, \n\n>* for old lang syne^(old long ago), \n\n>we'll take a cup of kindness yet, \n\n>* for old lang syne^(old long ago).\n\nAnd surely you'll buy your pint cup! \n\n* and surely I'll buy mine! \n\nAnd we'll take a cup o' kindness yet, \n\n* for old lang syne^(old long ago).\n\n>CHORUS\n\n>For old lang syne^(old long ago), my dear, \n\n>* for old lang syne^(old long ago), \n\n>we'll take a cup of kindness yet, \n\n>* for old lang syne^(old long ago).\n\nWe two have run about the slopes, \n\n* and picked the daisies fine; \n\nBut we've wandered many a weary foot, \n\n* since old lang syne^(old long ago).\n\n>CHORUS\n\n>For old lang syne^(old long ago), my dear, \n\n>* for old lang syne^(old long ago), \n\n>we'll take a cup of kindness yet, \n\n>* for old lang syne^(old long ago).\n\nWe two have paddled in the stream, \n\n* from morning sun till dine‚Ä†; \n\nBut seas between us broad have roared \n\n* since old lang syne^(old long ago).\n\n>CHORUS\n\n>For old lang syne^(old long ago), my dear, \n\n>* for old lang syne^(old long ago), \n\n>we'll take a cup of kindness yet, \n\n>* for old lang syne^(old long ago).\n\nAnd there's a hand my trusty friend! \n\n* And give me a hand o' thine! \n\nAnd we'll take a right good-will draught, \n\n* for old lang syne^(old long ago).\n\n>CHORUS\n\n>For old lang syne^(old long ago), my dear, \n\n>* for old lang syne^(old long ago), \n\n>we'll take a cup of kindness yet, \n\n>* for old lang syne^(old long ago).\n\nSuch a heavy Si and Fi song.  And the Si becomes Se by taking a sensory drink of alcohol and you relive those memories in the present while also synchronizing with the party in the present and the memories of old become intertwined in a weave with the memories of the present as a chain and thus the times of old never die for they are forever reborn / renewed / regenerated with the present.  They still linger here in my heart.\n\nNote the cup of kindness is not just a reference to alcohol but is also a reference to the concept of holy grail, and also older cups of metaphor, cups / cauldrons which are cups of "otherworldly" renewal that "blesses" the material world.  \n\nIt is at the time of liminal spaces such as New Years / Winter Solstice (liminal spaces being the threshold spaces, the spaces between times, boundaries, spaces of beginnings and passages) where we^(humans) become most aware of the otherworld even if its always around us.
1	I would probably feel this way if I had friends, lol
1	I surely feel nostalgic and sentimental, but it's a new year! Which means there's a lot of possibilities!!! So I feel nostalgically excited!
3	Shit, I forgot who it was, but on the cnn ball drop live stream they just did a tribute to someone on guitar. And that performance was fucking incredible.	
25	Fantasizing future conversations	Do you guys do it a lot, specially when anticipating meeting someone you like, I've heard that it can be harmful and should be avoided, cause it will never go as you imagine it will, what you guys think? 
15	I used to do this a lot. It is a bad habit because you are essentially cutting them and their personalty and feelings out of the conversation. You're talking to yourself. It's self-centered, more about what you want to happen. Basically it turns every interaction into an agenda, you always have something you want. It is manipulative. It makes it so you can't just talk to them and have a conversation. I understand wanting to come off well, especially with someone you like, but as cliche as it sounds you just need to be yourself. Genuine conversation is always better than manufactured call and response. Especially as the other person doesn't know their lines.
11	I do it all the time. Never found it to be harmful per say but definitely never goes as planned. 
7	I fantasize future convo, future instagram post and caption, future tweet, future jokes, etc
6	I work in sales, so these conversations ahead of time are critical. I use the fact that we‚Äôre good at empathy to have conversations before they happen. That way, when they do occur, I am ready for the harder parts of the talk and can convey the confidence that I want my clients to see in me. 
6	I walk around like a fuckin psychopath half the time talking to myself. \n\nIt's the same as if I'm practicing jiu jitsu in my mind. I try to reduce my 1000's of thoughts into my most coherent form, in the same way you think about metaphorical game plans when prepping to roll with someone
3	Personally I do this a lot and I think it helps me with social anxiety. I know it won‚Äôt always go the way I imagine, but just ‚Äòrehearsing‚Äô social interaction makes me seem like an awesome extrovert, otherwise I would never leave the house. 
1	i do this all the time. makes me nervous in the moment but it‚Äôs just fine. it‚Äôs fun to fantasize. 
1	All the time with people I like, but also with people I want to fight LOL\n
1	I do it all the time, although I try and reassure myself that it won't go like that in any form or fashion. If I try and make things go according to my fantasy, oftentimes I am not really present.
69	Weird way of flirting/showing affection/friendliness	I‚Äôve noticed a pattern in myself, in that whenever I really like someone or want to flirt with them; my method is to almost act like a school boy and resort to throwing objects like paper balls, or tease them with nicknames or friendlyish abuse, and basically annoy them as much as possible.\n\nIs this something common to ENFPs? If so, why?
23	Yeah I can relate. I learned to just be conscious of it and flirt conventionally on top of it. A little teasing works pretty well if you aren‚Äôt a complete childish dick if you know what I mean. It‚Äôs like negging I guess, you have to follow up with something cutesy 
12	I‚Äôm usually very nice to them with small acts of kindness or gifts. Just that extra attention I don‚Äôt give anyone else. I recommend looking up your love language. 
10	I‚Äôm aloof. I act disinterested 
8	I‚Äôm not totally sure why, but I do something similar. I‚Äôm constantly telling jokes that go too far. I‚Äôll say something extreme so as to get a laugh from people, but it ends up being hurtful. think it‚Äôs because I assume people can tell when I‚Äôm kidding. I tend to think I‚Äôm an open book but my poker face may be more prevalent than I assume.  
6	I act as obnoxious as possible while interacting with them as little as I can but still being in hearing range. The crawl onto their lap, shove my mouth onto theirs, and drag them into a forest for a good fuck.
6	Lol I 100% do this. I do a lot of like playful hits on the arm and throw a lot of straw wrappers at them. 
4	Same here. It really depends on the person for me though.
4	It‚Äôs like when I don‚Äôt like them I can flirt and get them with no hesitation. BUT when I like them I become a potato and loose myself with idolization. Honestly makes it really hard. 
5	annoying, teasing and trolling, exdeeee
5	Yes, a lot of people do this.  It took me a while to realize that being fake mean is supposed to be a form of teasing.  My enfp husband does this regularly.  He won't tease someone unless he likes them.
3	Yeah I'm like this 100% and it annoys me and the other person I'm sure. I'm almost like a school bully when I have a crush
3	I often use insults as well, can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs because of my laid back nature or it‚Äôs a defense mechanism to kind of show people ‚Äúhey I don‚Äôt mess around‚Äù. the people who can handle it are the ones who stay, my fianc√© and I are always going back and forth. 
3	Oh ya i use teasing a lot but it‚Äôs always worked well for me.
2	I totally do this too. I find it easier to tease lightly rather than compliment and show my true emotions
2	Female here, and I'm usually a bit of a light puncher.  Haha.
2	I can definitely relate. I have been with my wife for almost ten years and I still throw stuff at her or pick at her when she walks by me. =)
2	Mine is crushing them with my wit... Such as it is
1	We‚Äôre all tsunderes up in this place lol
5	Theory as to why I get anxious texting people	22M, Downloaded tinder and bumble as im in town for a little bit and had a couple conversations going, one person asked about my work and the country ive been living in and asked me what my favorite part of it was. I was sitting thinking what is was, the food, the culture, how people are very friendly and the atmosphere is much calmer and feels more safe than places in the United States, but I haven‚Äôt actually written anything. I dont know whether to be serious, to make a joking remark, there are several ways i could reply but i cant pick one cause im scared of what reaction it will cause. This happened a lot with my ex, we would talk a loooooot a lot of text and sometimes she should send me a harmless message and i would freak out not knowing what to reply. \n\nSo my theory is i think i havent picked one way to go about convo, and that causes stress. Hope this makes sense :/\n\nHappy new years!
5	Be yourself. Either they won't like it, in which case it wasn't meant to be, or they will like it in which case it's on.
1	Do you reach out to people often? This Enfp girl I‚Äôm seeing is distant all this while, (not just to me, but literally everyone of her friends, we‚Äôve all hung out in a mutual friend group)  and usually kills the conversation over text by just answering yes and no, all that kinda stuff. Is this due to anxiousness too?
9	Just heard this song and relate to it so much; it feels like it describes so many relationships I've had. Anyone else?	
6	These lyrics just struck me as very relatable as an ENFP:\n\n"They say, 'You're a little much for me\n\nYou're a liability\n\nYou're a little much for me'\n\nSo they pull back, make other plans\n\nI understand, I'm a liability\n\nGet you wild, make you leave\n\nI'm a little much for everyone\n\nThe truth is I am a toy that people enjoy\n\n'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore\n\nAnd then they are bored of me\n\nI know that it's exciting\n\nRunning through the night, but\n\nEvery perfect summer's\n\nEating me alive until you're gone\n\nBetter on my own"
4	I love Lorde and this song. I relate a lot.
3	i love this song, i listened to melodrama (the rest of this album) non-stop when going through a break-up this summer where i got told i was "too much, too soon," basically :"")\n\nlorde is the best!!
3	I had never heard this, but it is so good it hurts. Thanks
2	Damn... you got me. This song was an emotional punch to the nads when I first heard it. I showed it to my INFP friends while I was drunk and said I identify with this song a lot. He was like "... yeah, this is painful."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe part that hurts the most is this:\n\n"The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy\n\n'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore\n\nAnd then they are bored of me."
1	Yessss. I heard this song and related to it immediately. This sub is creepy, how similar we all are. I love it! 
0	Am I ENFP? Type me based on my post history pls?	
11	OP is trying to get us to read their home made  nerd-kink porn. 
3	Just take 16 personalities test.
1	It's Too Excited Tuesday!	\nCAN I GET A HELL YEAH?! It's Too Excited Tuesday! Unleash the happy!\n\nWhat makes you excited? :D\n
1	I was overly excited about fireworks yesterday :D (because in here, we get to shoot them at New Years eve only), if i had a tail like dogs it would have been wagging like hell :D 
1	A LOT OF THINGS! RIIGHT NOW I'M EXCITED BECAUSE IT'S FRIDAYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHICH MEANS IT'S GOING TO BE THE WEEKEND SOOOOOOOOOOOO SOOOOOOOOOOON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D!!!!!!!
4	If an afterlife exists, do you think you would be a different type?	If you don't think an afterlife exists, then it might not be a good idea to respond.\n\nIf you believe in an afterlife, go for it.
2	According to Christianity you receive a new body afterwards. I'm not sure about anything other than that, but I'm assuming that we would "max out" on each cognitive function and there might even be new cognitive functions that get maxed out. Because of that I'm not sure if mbti would still be coherent, but other personality styles might work.
2	I dont think we will need any cognitive function on the other side. \nAs for reincarnation which I think might be true, I think we would have other personality. The one which could move us closer towards the knowledge we need to gain to stay in heaven then.
1	Play Fate Stay Night the Visual Novel or watch the Fate Stay Night various animes.  It is a series where 7 magi that are currently alive, summon 7 ghosts of the past (heroes and such) to do a battle royal, murder, death, kill for the victor of this 7 way all out battle for a single wish granting device.\n\n* If you are INTJ start with the prequel Fate Zero anime.\n\n* If you are ENFP start with the "more" original, Fate Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works anime. (This is an anime adaptation of the visual novel which was the original, fate zero came later, it was a choose your own adventure type novel but also with illustrations and sounds and thus a visual novel, UBW chronicles the 2nd route, the 2nd set of choices you could take.)\n\nAfter you finish what anime I recommend above, watch the corresponding other anime, and then watch the 7 or so spin off properties also out in the Type Moon / Fate Multiverse.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSince this is a series dealing with summoning the ghosts of the past there is a lot of stuff with life after death, reincarnation, etc in subtle ways even though the main backstory is in a modern Earth with some magic in it.
1	It would definitely be interesting but I always thought your soul goes in afterlife along with your personality. However if there are new types I'm 100% researching all of them :o
88	Is anyone else bad at explanations?	So the title is kinda self explanatory, but I've noticed it in myself at the very least that I find it incredibly difficult to explain things to my friends and family. It's become the most noticeable when I try to make a summary of some movie or video game that my friends ask me about, and as I try to tell them the basics, I only end up confusing them with little details that aren't as important. . . Any other ENFPs have this problem? Or is it just me?
31	Yes, I'm bad at explaining things (which is why I also avoid arguments).
25	Yes, but I have improved over the years. As I gradually give less of a f * * k about others‚Äô opinions, the quality of my explanations skyrockets because I enjoy the sound of my own voice.
13	Yep, I'm terrible at it. I'm that person that gets halfway through telling a joke to a group of people only to realize I messed it up or can't quite remember how the punchline goes. 
12	I'm wondering if everybody on this thread is just very very young. ENFPs are over-represented in journalism, a career for good explainers if there ever was one. If I were to take a guess, if you have not yet developed your other functions (introverted feeling, extraverted thinking and introverted sensing) your primary cognitive function as an ENFP  (extraverted intuition) might go into overdrive when you try to explain things as it makes connections between seemingly disconnected details, leading to a summary that is less than grounded. 
18	Heck yes! Also telling stories about something that's happened to me... it just... doesn't work üòÖ
8	I'm good at it but people sometimes might lose patience because it's long-winded at times.
7	Lol yesssss. I use my body mannerisms and movements to help me explain too
6	it depends on the situation. i'm either very very good at it or totally incoherent. 
6	Yes. It helps me to take a second and think before I try to explain. Being one of you, I rarely stick to it tho.
3	Yes.  I interview folks on camera as part of my job and when I play back during editing its crazy how inarticulate my questions/explanations are vs how my subjects always give the answers I‚Äôm hoping for.  I‚Äôve stoped trying to understand or get better as I‚Äôm getting desired results. 
3	Yep. I want to be a dentist and when I interviewed for dental school I‚Äôve even had the interviewer state this back to me when I had to tell them about my research. I DREADED presentations on my research. I do like teaching, I was a swim instructor but found it was easier with kids than adults. \n\nI work in a dental office now and it‚Äôs even worse when I have to explain dental procedures in both in English or in Spanish, I usually just state I‚Äôll have someone else explain so I learn. 
3	I don't consider myself bad at it. I like how I explain things... but it definitely is not the clearest way. 
3	I can tell stories somewhat, but very specific kinds. I'm the worst at explaining things and confuse people all the time , a lot of the time over text 
3	Yes im terrible  at telling stories . That's y I use a lot of hand movements ..facial expressions etc . I also avoid arguments . Sometimes I think its better to stay silent than to say anything . I feel like a looser and I also have social anxiety  . I hate this trait of mine . 
3	I'm disorganized as fuck and it may take me quite a bit of time to say what I'm thinking, but I'm also incredibly articulate and good at putting into words what I'm thinking. Often times, I do hold back on explaining things if I feel shame though
3	Omg, I always tell people I‚Äôm bad at words when explaining things. Like, I just have a really hard time
3	Oh my god, yes! I dislike the stereotype where we are immediately expected to explain things well just because of dom Ne + aux Fi, which is supposed to be a "quick-minded, persuasive" combo. I mean it depends on the situation and the topic. Was told once that I talk really fast sometimes when explaining. That's probably because I knew stuff about the subject. And I explain just fine when given an amount of time to learn about the said topic. Other times, I get a little incoherent and the words my mouth spouts sometimes don't match what's in my head. Was even told once that I need to learn to shorten my sentence structure lmao. Also, my storytelling can be a bit scattered since I focus on irrelevant details. But yeah, it really goes either way for me. I can either explain well or nahhhh. But I love explaining through writing (or writing in general), though. But honestly, my verbal way of explaining things needs work lol.
3	Oh, trust me, you don't want me to talk about "this thing" that happened while I was on my way to "that thing"
2	It usually goes like this... if I stick to the basic, I‚Äôm sure I sound really dull and won‚Äôt be able to get other people‚Äôs attention. If I go into overdrive and start talking about all the little details, then I lose them halfway (unless I‚Äôm super loud or we‚Äôre one on one in which case they have no choice but to put up with me :D). \n\nI also should say that I used to write fiction and I usually had a lot of trouble getting to the meaty parts of the action, but I made the ride enjoyable with my paragraphs describing inner thoughts or scenery. I think this is an ability that translates well in written form, as weird as it may sound.
2	I‚Äôm either the best at explaining or completely inarticulate. \n\nI started doing science communication on YouTube as a hobby and I am getting very good at picking the right examples and metaphors, but sometimes I get overloaded with the things I want to tell about and I end up in *EXPLAIN ALL THE THINGS ALL TOGETHER N O W* which is confusionary and inarticulate.\n\nI think explanations are much more about empathy and care than they are about the actual concept, so ENFPs are naturally good at them, we just need to use all of out functions and not just one.
2	I'm really good at it, and excellent at explaining my points and arguing in general. It isn't something determined by the star signs, it's something determined by your ability to practice and concentrate on getting better at it. 
2	Can you give an example? Because I can't. 
2	I‚Äôm fine with explaining things as long as you‚Äôre fine with somebody who starts in the middle.
2	I‚Äôm terrible at supporting arguments üòÇ on paper, essay or online post - I can support it with thousands of facts and quotes and sources you name it! But in person, ESPECIALLY in the heat of the moment in a real argument I can‚Äôt support myself for the life of me. I also tend to avoid arguments cause ill look stupid and then remember what I should have said an hour later. I‚Äôm dating an ENTP, so he‚Äôs always able to support his side very very well -_- smh lol
2	Oh my God yes. It annoys the hell outta me
2	I'm 15 too but good at explanations, probably because when I was 8 I started explaining my cousin that's 4 years older than me the stuff she learnt in school everyday cause she didn't speak the language.\nPractice makes perfect! 
2	I can definitely relate to this... However, as an ENFP it has been a major interest to learn all the mechanics of the universe, especially what concerns human relation. So even though my explanations started out as a clusterfuck of of unrelevant details (and still are sometimes if I get too drunk or excited), learning and mapping different personality types and figuring what of logic resonates with the different ones gradually taught me how to transcribe my sometimes wild thoughts into graspable concepts. üßê\n\n... But no, it‚Äôs not just you üòä
2	Well it's because of our lack of ti and si, I guess. 
4	How do you handle heartbreak?	enfp here and i need some advice on getting over my ex. i can‚Äôt stop thinking about him even though he‚Äôs already moved on. it has been years. 
6	For me personally, it helps to better myself and know genuinely that I am doing ok; or at least doing better. Be easy and gentle and encouraging with yourself. Another mental trick that works for me is to remind myself of all the things that made me question the idea of being with him ‚Äúforever‚Äù. If those doubts were present, they would still be with you today. You have an opportunity now to open yourself up to better opportunities and to learn things you never imagined. Basically you have to find ways to trick yourself into feeling ok for now. It might still hurt for awhile (if you‚Äôre a hopeless romantic like me), but one day something will catalyze the ‚Äúsnap‚Äù and you‚Äôll be over it. There‚Äôs no telling what that will be, but rest assured that day will come. For me it was when he was on his 4th girlfriend who happened to be a friend/acquaintance of mine. I was really sad for a few days and then suddenly it felt like a weight lifted. I hope my experience helps you in some way and I hope you are doing ok. 
5	If you‚Äôre anything like me you need to break off contact. Our Si will keep us locked on to things from our past almost indefinitely unless we choose to let go. That‚Äôs up to you though. YOU have to make that choice otherwise that‚Äôs where you‚Äôll stay. Follow your Ni to greener pastures young padawan!
4	what helped me move on from a similar heartbreak that you speak of, was recognizing it was not so much me not being to able to get over the person but much more of my ego being crushed.\n\nI gave away so much value of myself to someone who did not deserve it. When I started to have alone time to reflect, I was able to discover my gifts and how they are valuable to the world, then I was able to start moving on.\n\nA gift, something you are really good at but for you it comes easy. Now this is not so easy to recognize since they do come so easy you do not think much of it.\n\nI love the MBTI for that reason. I found I have gifts for writing and speaking. That I can explain very abstract ideas into easy to understand language. I found that my vivid imagination was something that not everyone else had.\n\n&#x200B;
2	I got over her by avoiding her in every possible way and just doing stuff with friends for a week or two. Every time the person comes to mind, just shake the thought off and continue minding your business.
2	[removed]
2	Drinking, self-destructing, waking up in the debris of my self-destruction, picking myself back up, moving on.
1	Allow yourself to cry, then use each day to build yourself back up. Avoid seeing him so you can move on. Good luck
1	Oh. You poor thing. üòï I‚Äôm just as bad. I ended up having to ask my last other to block me on everything as a final cutting the cord solution. I hate that I can‚Äôt let go of things at times.
10	Need Advice from ENFP Nurses/Health Professionals	Hi everyone, \n\nI've worked in law, social work, and most recently, as an investigative writer, a job which I excelled at and still enjoy to an extent. A couple months ago, I lost my 35-year-old husband to cancer. I was his caregiver until his last breath. I took him to every hospital appointment and did insane amounts of research on everything related to his treatment, ranging from allopathic to naturopathic options. Ever since he died, I've had a burning desire to serve cancer patients in some capacity and to do work that contributes to reducing pain/suffering in the world. I'm considering going back to school with the ultimate goal of becoming an oncology nurse practitioner, but before I invest time/money into this career path, I want to make sure this isn't just an emotional decision I would regret in the future. I have several friends who work as nurses whom I will also be speaking with, but they're all sensors. (I've considered the fact that nursing may be a sensor-dominated profession). I'd really appreciate if any ENFP nurses or other healthcare professionals would offer their perspectives on working as a nurse, ideally, those in oncology. \n\n* Are you satisfied with your job? \n* Do you find the work intellectually stimulating?\n* What are the most difficult/stressful aspects of your job? What do you most enjoy? 
6	Fourth year med student. Love my job, love working with patients. Very fulfilling. I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm very approachable, calming, supportive, and empathetic by my patients. And I feel intellectually challenged every day. 100% recommend healthcare. Only hard part is reigning in my ‚ÄòPreceiving‚Äô and trying to stay on top of work.\n\nWill also mention that I could see myself getting emotionally bogged down/exhausted if I went into oncology just because I am so empathetic. But that will be true to an extent in any field. 
2	Enfp  male  here and worked as a CNA on rehab units for 8 years.  Just last year I had to get out due to burnout and the facility I was working at the higher ups were not givin out raises like they promised.    For the first few years I loved and enjoyed my work.   I love to help people and take care of them as they were like my family members.  Just last year though it was taking a toll on my body and mind and just wasn't happy anymore.  Right now I've switched from  CNA  to actually working as a pest control tech and really enjoy it.  I'm getting paid more and I'm actually more outdoors now.  
1	I can't say I have experience (I'm planning on going to study nursing next year), but I'd definitely say that it's not a bad thing if you want to go down that path! If anything, it would help you to be able to relate and sympathize with those going through cancer themselves. You'd be surprised at how many people going into nursing/the medical field do so because of family/friends, but in my experience it doesn't hurt to do something because you genuinely want to help others going through something that you've had experience with yourself.
1	> I have several friends who work as nurses whom I will also be speaking with, but they're all sensors.\n\nDon't let something like this stop you, but at the same time, try to consider why this might make it more challenging for you to pursue this endeavor.
1	I‚Äôm in my junior year of nursing school and can say it‚Äôs been a challenge. Most of my classes don‚Äôt allow me to think creatively and the course load is intense at times. I don‚Äôt mind this work now because it means I‚Äôll be helping people in the future. My mom is a nurse practitioner and everyday you get to meet new people and experience a connection you would most likely never see. The other thing is all the options you have once you graduate there are several specialties and different kinds of healthcare centers a nurse can work in, but you could also go advance practice. There are also several routes you can go that don‚Äôt involve patient care such as law, teaching, pharmacy, or making medical equipment. Nursing school is challenging but in the end I know it will be worth it to me. 
1	This is actually interesting because my ENFP dad had a similar reaction when I was diagnised with this chronic condition that almost took my life. Hes always meticulously looking into new research related to my condition and trying to pinpoint different sympoms to side effects from my meds. Minus the part that includes me dying. He isnt considering pursuing any medicine cause this was all between ages 55 and 60 for him. 
1	I'm a Nurse but I left bedside Nursing not too long ago. At the time I would say I was unsatisfied with my job. Although the work was very stimulating, I quickly burned myself out. I have been trying to stay in Nurse related jobs since then but with bedside I feel like I took too much on. I spent so much time taking care of my patients that I didnt have anymore energy to take care of myself and it took a toll on my health (mental, physical and emotional)\n\nI never want to discourage someone from following their dreams. My experience might not be yours and it sounds like you are being called to do something. If you get into it and dont like it Nurses with Oncology experience have unlimited opportunities outside of the hospital. Good Luck to you!
1	I was originally going to study occupational therapy but realized my interests aligned with the values of social work way more. I have a health science bachelor‚Äôs degree and am obsessed with health and helping people, but realized that the direct medical degrees didn‚Äôt fully utilize my strengths. I‚Äôm getting my MSW and specializing in health to combine the two passions. There are lots of options in the medical world and social work world. 
1	Female ENFP nurse here! I love it but cant stay at a specific job/department more than 4 years cause I get bored. Also Oncology is very emotionally hard because many patients dont survive and watching the deterioration can be emotionally taxing if your high in empathy.
0	If your goal is to help people, stay as far away from the medical field as possible. 
95	If theres no parking then it wasnt meamt to be	
12	So fucking true haha.\n\nHow to get motivated: Imagine a near-death experience.
26	Um what?
1	I can't believe there are other people that have these thoughts! I'm so shook right now. 
1	I once read that giving yourself ultimatums like this is a sign of OCD
26	Do you sometimes stop yourself from saying something that may be perceived as weird/inappropriate even though you don't mean it in the way that others may think?	E.g. "you have beautiful eyes" to someone of the opposite sex who you're not romantically interested in\n\nI don't know if that's a good example but I hope you get what I'm trying to ask? 
15	I just say it anyways. For some, they see the realness and are drawn to it, and others know to stay away. It‚Äôs an easy way to know who‚Äôs really worth sticking around.
9	Yes! I do this because I got burned in the past for it. I once used to openly compliment others, until people started thinking I had ulterior motives.. but it‚Äôs like nah man! You just have beautiful eyes and I wanted to tell you! Sheesh. 
8	Yes! But more often than not now I just say it. Keeping it bottled up just means I‚Äôll obsess over it later. 
5	I say things like, "Don't worry, I got this. I got it like gonorrhea." \n\nMy friends have asked me to stop saying things like this.\n\nNow they just sigh and accept my weirdness. \n\n
3	Yes!
3	Sometimes when I‚Äôm in groups and I have an urge to make a witty comeback or remark I take a second to run it over in my head and make sure it makes sense. Usually by that point, the moment is gone and I just continue to listen and silently congratulate myself for not embarrassing myself. As a kid, I often just said whatever came into my mind, no matter how nonsensical it sounded or if it made more sense in my head. I‚Äôve tried to control that as much as I can now that I‚Äôm an adult.\n
2	Yeah, pretty much constantly.
2	Just say it! :) Embrace the weirdness. Friends will call you on it, but also likely enjoy it as part of what makes you you. \n\n
1	Yup! And then I say it anyway and push past the awkwardness. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1	Just go for it. I use to be like this as well, I would think people might think I'm hitting on them (I get this a lot!). But fuxk what they think, you have beautiful eyes dang it, take the compliment or don't.
1	Haha reminds me of this Flight of the Concords clip - https://youtu.be/YwFPJ2AWrEU
3	Arguments/conflict between an ENFP and INFP	I‚Äôm a 30 year old INFP and I‚Äôve been dating a 36 year old ENFP for almost a year. When things are good, we have a very tender, extremely affectionate, loving bond filled with laughter and mutual care. We‚Äôre both passionate and sensitive and sometimes those things bond us extremely deeply.\n\nHowever, out of all relationships I‚Äôve ever been in, we have the worst rows. I am extremely conflict-averse ( to a fault) while she is far more upfront about her emotions and it is as though if one of us is a little tired, stressed, hormonal, it takes no time at all for a remark to be taken the wrong way and a giant powder keg of an argument will quickly escalate. There is shouting, insults, tears, frayed nerves and hours of argument. Her temper is red hot, and yet she is quick to forgive. I think I am too. So when it dies down, it is as though we think we will never fight like that again, until inevitably we do.\n\nI truly don‚Äôt want to present a one sided view. I absolutely think we create this poisonous dynamic together when it happens. Yet I feel so confused as to why we do. When we argue I‚Äôm sometimes so desperate to restore peace and lower the volume that I beg for her to calm down, yet in the heat of the moment it seems to be literally impossible for my entreaties to reach her. She is extremely sensitive and takes sometimes my strenuously neutral words as further jnsult and injury. I often lose my temper as a result and things get worse and we both seem to be reduced to (what feels to me) like horrible adolescent behaviour until the calm eventually sets in. Then there is the healing period which is exhausting and sometimes really hard to navigate on both sides.\n\nRecently I told her I didn‚Äôt think we could possibly be good for each other if this was how we conducted our conflicts. I am desperate for both of us to do a better job of recognising toxic patterns in the heat of the moment as they build, but her impulsiveness and expressiveness seem to make it very hard for her to do this.\n\nI am really struggling- I want to save the relationship but feel we each have such a different way of approaching the whole conflict problem that I‚Äôm not sure how to resolve it. I find it hard to reach her to say these things and when I try she reads it as my blaming her for for all of it when I am doing my hardest to recognise my own bad behaviour and failings explicitly. \n\nAny advice from ENFPs on how I can improve how we treat each other and understand each other in these horribly intense and painful episodes and their aftermath?
5	I am an ENFP men with an INFP woman. Both in our thirties. Year long relationship. We had similar issues though we never got to your level of fights. Ours were mostly short cold periods with snarky and snippy comments. We're past that though and our relationship is just getting stronger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur cognitive functions ( Ne-Fi-Te-Si) make and break us. We share the same with the INFPs ( Fi-Ne-Si-Te ).\n\nYou have to recognize the possible loops that are being involved which is when you're either extroverting mostly ( Ne-Te) or introverting mostly ( Fi-Si). This is when things go off rail usually because we need a balance of both introverting and extroverting. And given that we dont rank them equally, gaps in communication will happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe thing is you cant really know what the person is feeling/thinking when he is introverting because it is hidden from sight. So you can only really rely on Ne ( extraverted intuition) because that's the common ground everyone can see.\n\nWhat causes friction is our mutual Fi-Si. Naturally these are the hidden things, and they require good communication to bring it out on the open.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs an ENFP, i never realized how dominant Fi from INFP could actually be really grating because it seems so reactive to Si, which is our inferior function on which we need to build on.  Also as an ENFP ,we like to brainstorm, and then filter with Fi after we sufficiently looked at different possibilities. With a partner that is Fi dominant, that process can be hijacked by having a judgement call early in our brainstorming and that is also very frustrating. The latter can be worked on when particular taste are known and factored in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, keeping to a routine and the peace which mostly relates to Te-Si is unhelpful and exacerbates both our mbti personalities as they are not what we necessarily care about in life. Our relationship is stronger because we project forward, and we try to change our routine by adding new things. So we stay Ne-Fi or Fi-Ne focused, which really relates to personal growth as an individual.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ngood luck.
2	Oh. Close to home. \n\nI‚Äôm an ENFP. I recently revealed my romantic feelings for a close friend who is an INFP. She told me she couldn‚Äôt feel the same. I decided against my better judgement to continue down the path of friendship (something which has never worked for me unless I‚Äôve had significant space to get over it. And even then...) because we‚Äôd both come to cherish each other‚Äôs counsel and our bond as individuals.\n\nUltimately I didn‚Äôt want to hurt her. Equally though I didn‚Äôt want to make myself look bad by being that guy who would only hang around if there was something in it for him at the end at the same time as loosing someone I‚Äôve genuinely come to care for. This feels like a constant and endlessly painful balancing act for me that‚Äôs repeated itself over and over. Trying to be considerate of the needs and emotional health of someone I care deeply about but balancing that with my own Ne wants and desires feels like I‚Äôm being pulled apart by horses. E vs. I I guess.\n\nLo and behold the whole thing collapses again less than two weeks later. I find myself telling her that I feel jealous that she‚Äôs dating because I want to be that person for her but her saying she doesn‚Äôt see me like that. She still wants to maintain our friendship though. Something which I know probably can‚Äôt work.\n\nTL;DR My point is that sometimes you hit a tipping point. If the negatives have begun to outweigh the positives and you find yourselves locking horns over the same sorts of things time and time again and neither of you is capable of being the bigger person then maybe it‚Äôs time to throw in the towel. Or look in to alternatives. If you genuinely want to make it work then couples counselling can work if you‚Äôre both committed and open to the idea. Otherwise; the writing may be on the wall so to speak. Sorry if that‚Äôs not what you wanted to hear.\n\nP.S. This probably just makes me sound like an asshole who can‚Äôt take a hint. üòì
2	Well it's going to be tough considering you're both Fi types and despite what most would think it's a fuse for deep intimacy and horrible blow out war zone battles. Quite frankly, this girlfriend of yours needs to swallow her PRIDE. Both of you should relate deeply to how shitty you both probably feel in these moments. But you are admittedly misinterperting and taking each others words way too personal. Which makes sense, because you are both deeply personal people obviously and things such as feelings and values naturally hold more weight as they are deeply tied to both of your identities. Try telling her next time (because there will be a next time) that it's not that you are TRYING to pin it all on her but recognize that you are BOTH fucking up, that it's normal and to be expected in an intimate relationship but that you value your bond so deeply that you want to make things work, you don't want to continue hurting eachother and in order for your relationship to get better, you NEED to BOTH acknowledge your part in these blow out fights. It's messy and uncomfortable but you're WILLING to do this because you love HER. If she keeps holding onto her damn pride like this though, you need to get out of there. Sorry, I don't want to sound like the exaggerated relationship subreddit folks but the dynamic you've described can't get better unless she's willing to take some responsibility too and act like an adult.
2	Oh man, dealing with INFPs, the Fi masters, is to always validate their feelings or empathize asap. They are very stubborn, very sensitive, can be really good at empathy, but also really good at tearing you down if on the negative side. When you remember how their feelings are the most important thing ever, then you can get along ok. \n\noh and when she tries deflect on you when you approach her on something she is doing wrong, you can revolt to say, I am not trying to hurt your feelings, I am not going anywhere, no one is saying that you are a bad girl friend or bad person. Yes I do other things wrong but when we finish this issue then you will get your chance to address to talk about me. \n\nThe other problem with relationships, they can usually result to tearing each other down, losing respect for each other. It is important to have boundaries on self respect. Like, yes I made the mistake of being absent minded about getting you razors when I went to the grocery store but that does not get give you the right to call me names or put me down. \n\nYou have control on how you react, if she starts trying to tear you down with those Fi skills of hers, you can choose to stay on logical terms, like I am not getting into personal attacks, so please keep personal things out of it. 
1	There are function things involved but others have mentioned those. I'm dating an ENTJ with Borderline Personalty Disorder so I know rage. From a purely relationship standpoint I can tell you that telling someone to calm down when they are upset or angry is never a good idea. To them it appears like you are just trying to shut them up and aren't listening to them or acknowledging them. This obviously makes them more mad. It seems to them you care more about what others might think than you do what they think, which to be honest is does sound that way. Reading what you've said it doesn't sound like you're truly listening. You are so concerned with the situation you aren't looking deeper.\n\nI understand wanting to control a problem, solve it, think of solutions. But often when someone is mad they just want to vent, not hear how to fix it so they aren't mad anymore. You need to make her understand she is truly being heard, and actually hear her. Instead of saying "Calm down" say things like "Honey, I hear you. I understand you are upset by ..." then you can either apologize if appropriate and say you love her and say you are here to listen. You can ask if there is anything you can do.\n\nWhen someone is overcome by anger or being upset they don't always think clearly. Just listen to what's wrong and be there.
18	Understanding others' points of view and the dilemma of disapproval vs. acceptance	As an empath and ENFP, I invest a considerable amount of energy putting myself in other's shoes. People's lifestyles and life experiences are so diverse that it's impossible for everyone to agree on everything, but I strive for it nonetheless. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI find myself constantly, and often unknowingly, trying to make sure that everyone's opinions are validated. I find it nearly impossible to ignore atypical reactions, opinions, or emotions to things that, for me, have typical and normal responses. I need acknowledge in my head the reasons for why people act a certain way, and since I usually do not have enough evidence for their exact reasons (i.e. how they were raised, what has happened to them in the past, what kind of stuff they have been through, etc), I can usually assume a vague explanation and store it away in my brain in order to avoid the comfortableness of not being able to relate. This sometimes leads me to befriending people who may lead questionable lifestyles, which may in turn impact how I lead my own life. This often creates an internal conflict wherein I question not only how I was raised and currently live my own life, but also what my own long-term goals and expectations are and what to expect from society, family, friends, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry if that was a bit heavy, I don't know how to describe these things or put them into words. Can anyone else relate?
7	I think this is a common experience for enfp's... I have made it my career so I get paid to do what we do passively. I am a mental health nurse working in a metropolitan hospitals adolescent inpatient unit. I live alongside troubled teens getting to know how they've been raised and how it has impacted how they live their life. A lot of my success comes from tailoring my approach to each individual based off information gathered through extroverted intuition and really simply role modelling how to live and interact with others. It also means I get to improve the lives of young people by modelling pro social behaviour which is deeply satisfying as it means creating a better future for us all.
1	I couldn‚Äôt have said it better myself. I can definitely relate. And it takes up a lot of mental energy - the process of being empathetic and diverting your own thought pattern into more rational factual ones aaaand trying to distinguish between which method is more appropriate to which situation.
1	I just took a Breyers Miggs inspired test earlier today and found this Subreddit shortly after. Your post made a lot of sense to me and it's comforting knowing that I'm not the only person that thinks this way. I find comfort in knowing the motives behind certain people's actions, why they act a certain way and I feel that this is partly because it helps keep me in control. The whole comment that you made about looking to other people for guidance on how to act/react in certain situations stood out to me.
1	We can naturally walk in anyone's shoes because of Ne and Fi and can see things from every side. We can understand any position and how someone got there even if we very much disagree. Even what we or others would consider bad people or troubled. We are incredibly understanding, more than other types that are more judgy. But you have to understand just because you can understand someone or don't judge them it doesn't mean you agree or are approving. You live your own life and make your own choices and  they make theirs.
1	ENFPs Don't Appreciate Ti (Introverted Thinking)? Thoughts?	I have a sister who prefers the "ENFP" type. Whenever I delve into my thinking behind something during conversations, her interest level and attention immediately drops. She wants to disappear.\n\nAlthough, she isn't "weak" with Ti, easily solving logic puzzles... she doesn't appreciate when I ask her to offer her reasoning behind something. It seems like a pointless question to her.\n\nENFPs, what are your perspectives and experiences with Ti? Do you appreciate Ti, look up to it? Disregard it? Use it only when necessary?\n\nWhat are your opinions about "Ti users" and their approach to life?
4	Enfp (more or less) do not posses ti since it is our 7th/deceiving function. We regard ti as something subjective (at least subconsciously). We are capable of rational thoughts but not really of logical thoughts. That's also the reason why a lot of enfp's are quite intellectual--to compensate for the lack of ti
4	I personally LOVE Ti and I respect it but generally Ti users tend to treat me like shit because they want me to always translate everything I say in a way that suits their way of thinking but don't make much of an effort to do the same. Then there's the attitude of undervaluing feelings in general and dismissing them. Which is weird to me because I KNOW they have feelings too and can be incredibly out of touch with them which throws their shit out of balance. It's like most believe Fi users have nothing to offer and are generally stupid individuals. All this wholier than thou worship of logical thinking while demanding Fi , a function concerned with subjective values derived from delving into the human soul, psyche, experience and emotional reactions, which are inherently illogical in nature, be presented in a logical format. Makes no sense to me but hey, just a stupid emotional unicorn over here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo in regards to that, I only ever check out of a conversation with a Ti user after I notice the one sided effort I'm putting into the interaction.\n\nyoooo I sound so bitterrrr lolololololol
2	I work in data architecture which is Ti activity. I've studied alot of things which involved Ti. (e.g. Finance, Comp Sci).\n\nI appreciate all cognitive functions, but my preference is that of ENFP. I've been mistaken as INTP though.\n\nI can't disregard it given my professional activities. I see it used in my day to day but i bring about my perspective through Te.\n\nIf i think of Ti dom and Ti auxiliary types. I like all of them. Given my professional domain, they are important to me. \n\nSome on this sub have also expressed affection for the INTP.\n\n&#x200B;
2	Never been a huge fan. I understand why we need it, and I understand how useful it is, but I cannot for the life of me use it properly. Also, I don‚Äôt like how restricting it can be. 
1	As an ENFP I can‚Äôt help but think that when we‚Äôre young and we haven‚Äôt developed our functions to their fullest degree, it might play against our intuitive strengths to explain our thoughts to the degree rational types desire (so I might ask how old your sister is?).\n\nAlso, we don‚Äôt often feel comfortable expressing our opinions if we feel like it might lead to disharmony; far better to acknowledge the situation and walk away from it or give a brief explanation and move on.\n\nWith maturity though we develop our Te which allows us to express ourselves more plainly. I have no trouble asserting myself now for instance whereas before I might have been too concerned in case my opinion offended someone. Does that make sense?
1	Expressing Te/Ti is going to be hard for an ENFP, at least if they haven't matured yet. I'd also say that your sister being good at logic puzzles is about her Ne, not about Ti. My guess is that when you delve into your thinking its just boring to her, because to an ENFP our thinking on a topic can change based on the day. Its not something that interests us naturally, we'd generally prefer talking about the implications of things or how it makes us feel. \n\nAs for my views on Ti, its not even in my stack. I don't really have a good understanding of how my life would be different if I had a strong Ti. It sounds interesting though. FWIW I never *understood* math until I took a symbolic logic course, and I still use the basics from that course in my everyday life when making logically consistent and valid arguments. This is still more Te than Ti though, and I never use this to reach new conclusions, just to verify what my Ne tells me. Its sometimes hard to trust logic over intuition, but its necessary to be grounded sometimes. 
1	Hehe, socionics is a variant MBTI thing that was developed independently (away from MBTI) based off Jung's theories.\n\nWell in socionics all of the 16 types have something called a Point of Least Resistance (POLR). This is also known as the Vulnerable function, a function we are both sensitive to but the sensitivity with barely a push can escalate to pain.\n\n* Our POLR function is always the word of the Tetriary function but with opposite introversion / extroversion energies.\n\n* Thus our POLR has opposite introversion and extroversion alignment energies as our Dominant function.\n\n* Thus our POLR is the same introvert / extrovert alignment as our Secondary / Auxiliary function.  Our POLR will also share the same Judgement or Perception type as our Secondary / Auxiliary function.  Thus if our Secondary is Feeling than our POLR is Thinking based (and vice versa), if our Secondary is Intuition than our POLR is Sensing based (and vice versa.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**So why am I bringing this up?**\n\n*Well the OP was asking about ENFPs and their relationship to Ti users in themselves and Ti users in other people =P*\n\n^(***Guess what function is POLR for ENFPs***, *it is Ti* =D)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo I will trust you ENFPs to do your own research now that I gave you some starting info.  But here are two other things to read until then.\n\nhttp://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/167-The-Hidden-Agenda-and-Point-of-Least-Resistance-(PoLR)  This link will talk about Te (the ENFP's Mobilizing / Activating / Hidden Agenda function for it is like applying the gas / accelerator) and Ti (The ENFP's POLR / Vulnerable / Brake function)\n\nI also have a 2nd link but read the next posts for I will quote it.
1	I've always read solving puzzles and using objective logic were Te. Ti is subjective logic which might only make sense to that Ti user. We prefer logic and facts and examples, proof etc. that is objectively proven and understood by everyone. Te is more of a societal Thinking function while obviously TI is the subjective, personal Thinking function. Te is also much more action and results driven, A to B, efficiency, etc. than Ti so I suspect your sister doesn't necessarily want to hear the whole explanation she just wants to cut to the chase and maybe apply it.
1	i feel like i use Ti often and i heavily appreciate it in my (INTP) partner!
1	Reading this I realized I might be mistyped
1	I think Ti users want a book about how to do everything, how to manuals for every little thing. They wants facts and proof about every little thing. Argh, so annoying sometimes. Te and Ti are always at constant war. Te wants to connect the dots to system A but Ti says wait, those dots cannot connect to system A because of fact 1 and 2 about the hidden analysis that nobody has ever heard of except for me.
1	Motivational Monday!	\nToday is a new day! A fresh week! An opportunity start something new and get back into life. \n\nWhat inspires you, /r/ENFP?\n\nPost stories, quotes, and images that give you life. Need a little rally? Don't be shy posting your goals; let /r/ENFP give you a pep talk!\n
3	Is mbti genetic?	Haii! I am am ENFP female, and I just found out the my older brother is an INFP, isn't it funny how similar that is?\n\nAre yours similar to your siblings too? I wanna know! üíó
6	Personality traits are heritable, and can also be influenced by socialization.
3	ENFP here and I have INFP brother and INFJ sister 
2	ISTP here. Mom's ENFJ and dad is ISFJ. \n\nI don't think it is.
2	No MBTI is not genetic.\n\nSome other aspects of personality (not MBTI related for there are 400+ traits we call personality and MBTI is only part of some of those things), may be partially genetic though and this may increase your chances of having certain type compared to the general population probability but there is enough differences in types between parents and siblings, siblings and siblings, and even twin with twin to know MBTI is not genetic.\n\nAka the dices may be "weighted" but even weighted dices never land on specific numbers with high precision.  It is not a coin that always lands heads up, tails bottom.
1	Heritability and personality works kinda weird and difficult. My brother is an ESTJ; Mom ESFJ; Dad ISTP. So I think it's hard to say that dichotomies are transfered. Though I found that me, my dad and my grandfather (ISTJ) are all highly introverted. More introverted than we'd actually like to be, so there might be a connection.
1	My parents are ISFJ & ISTJ Brothers ISTJ & ESTJ, so there may be a correlation there. I‚Äôm the ENFP outlier.
1	i don‚Äôt think it is genetic. my parents are both introverts. my mother is an isfj, dad hasn‚Äôt taken the test but i‚Äôm willing to wager he‚Äôs an ixfp. my brother is an infp and i‚Äôm enfp. guess the only common thread that runs through is that we‚Äôre all feelers.
1	Personality as well as intelligence are mostly defined by genetics and environment. So it makes sense.
1	My dad is an estj and my mom is an infp. My sister is a esfp and my brother is an intj and I‚Äôm the enfp! We were all a mix of everything a little 
2	when people won‚Äôt talk it out	looking for advice on how to navigate a friendship with someone whose personality is the polar opposite. i don‚Äôt know his type, otherwise would probably be posting there. (though would guess istp/intp)\n\ni am traveling with an acquaintance - we are both spontaneous and flexible, without holiday plans, hence decided to take a road trip together. over the course of the past week however i have been unable to grasp what our friendship is - he has been incredibly kind to drive the entire trip and pretty much follows any plans i make without hesitation. but he refuses to tell me anything he wants to do or any kind of preferences for our trip when i ask, so i just plan everything and wait for him to say no or propose something different. and it‚Äôs made me feel super selfish planning this trip around me, which i told him today and he basically confirmed that he also thinks i‚Äôm selfish. i know i tend to be, but i‚Äôm still trying to figure out the line between being inconsiderate and over accommodating (people-pleasing). but he refuses to tell me why he thinks i‚Äôm selfish and says there‚Äôs nothing he can say or do that will make me change because i‚Äôm a child (he‚Äôs 33 and i‚Äôm 27). tl;dr he won‚Äôt ‚Äútalk it out.‚Äù\n\ni am thankful for him just following my every whim on this trip, but at the same time i fundamentally disagree with many of the things he says/believes, and any time i express this he pulls the ‚Äúeveryone else is immature‚Äù card. he carries a lot of anger and negativity with him and i understand why given the environment he grew up in, and it‚Äôs just how he operates. i honestly don‚Äôt want to have more conversations with him at this level of connection because he won‚Äôt engage with any different perspectives. either i distance myself the rest of the trip, which again seems like a selfish thing to do, or i have to be fake. i feel like there is some friend etiquette in this situation for the rest of the trip that i need to follow, but not sure what that is.\n\nto top it all off, given my housing situation he offered to let me stay at his place for the next month on the couch. i feel like accepting would be taking advantage of his hospitality when we clearly don‚Äôt get along. dunno, thoughts?
5	Sounds like he's just a little manipulative. Don't take him too serious because he knows just as little about what he wants as you do.\n\nI'd suggest you to not go live with him unless you feel like being treated like a child for the time to come.
3	I would try to find a different living situation because this experience is a good preview of what your relationship will be like once you move in with him. I think it‚Äôs a nice gesture of him to do everything he‚Äôs done, sure. But it sounds like he doesn‚Äôt make the effort to engage just like you said. Tbh that‚Äôs a huge red flag. I would keep your distance and maintain only a platonic relationship. 
22	Are ENFP egoists?	I‚Äôve always been called egoist by my parents, and I‚Äôd say I tend to put my needs before others‚Äô and probably don‚Äôt pay enough attention to others. Is this an ENFP thing or am I just a bit of an asshole?\n\nWhat about you guys?
36	Not me. I try to be considerate and kind. When making decisions of what to do with someone else I am pretty agreeable and quick to compromise on what I want. When serving up meals I have cookee I give the best stuff to whomever I am eating with. \n\nThat said I have firm boundaries and if I really don't want to do something I won't. I also am not going to settle on someone that isn't making me happy or putting in an equal amount of effort as me. I will compromise to accommodate the people I care about but I won't abandon my goals and dreams.
27	I've almost never put my own needs before those of someone else and am constantly being used by others who are onto it. So personally, I wouldn't consider it part of my personality type whatsoever. 
13	I kinda tend to always put other first. It's a big problem where I'll put off even inconvienceing anyone a little even if I desperately need their help. But I'm also self centered. I'll talk about myself way too much and not pick up on others wanting to talk or me talking over people. IDK I'm both self centered and incredibly self serving. I think if it's something little and a result of my personality, like talking a lot, then I'll tend to be self centered but if it's an active choice like having someone pay for me or not wanting to bother someone with something then I'll be serving.
12	You ENFP are not anymore inherently egotistical than anyone else. \n\nFunny though, that reminds me, everyone I know seems to think me a saint‚Äî willing to at anytime suffer for my fellow humans, and set aside myself to support them instead. Punchline is, I‚Äôm one of the most narcissistic and prideful people I know. Heh. Guess it‚Äôs all about how you play your cards. Perk of being an INFJ, I guess. If you‚Äôre complex enough that nobody can understand you, well, they won‚Äôt even notice all self-absorbed things you do either, it seems. Just paint it up all nice and pretty, express a little genuine pain to attract others that would prey upon the fresh blood they smell in the air.. yeah. Saintly.\n\nSeems that‚Äôs the thing though: Who isn‚Äôt self-absorbed? Not that people aren‚Äôt capable of looking after one another, but honestly, if one would like to get technical, even the things we do for others makes us feel good about ourselves. Even just the desire to see another person genuinely smile? Isn‚Äôt that just a selfish desire? It‚Äôs something the you in this theoretical-equation would want, after all. Be that the case, what isn‚Äôt selfish? To what end can it be justified that a certain action is purely for the benefit of others, and not one‚Äôs self also? Even when one would sacrifice for what they love, is it not to prove, express, or otherwise proclaim their love? Is there not self involved in love? After all, if you did not feel the love by which you were compelled to act on the behalf of another in the first place, would you even act at all? If you had no desire to benefit another, to the point that you simply would not, wouldn‚Äôt that be the only time you were truly ‚Äòselfless‚Äô? As it would be the only time where you had no sense of your own self that you were projecting onto a situation, wouldn‚Äôt it? But then, if you did not help, for lack of want, wouldn‚Äôt you then be selfish to have denied the betterment of another‚Äôs situation and/or life? \n\nMaybe it‚Äôs not so much that you are egotistical, but rather, to exist at all is to ego. After all, the word ‚Äòego‚Äô only means ‚ÄòI‚Äô, and one cannot do *anything* without directly influencing what they intend to influence in some way, and all things are influenced by one simply existing.
16	guilty, I honestly have the biggest ego alive, and I‚Äôm way too ok with, it‚Äôs more of a matter of accepting it and learning to own it, trust me it can be a blessing with the right skills. I‚Äôve learnt to deal with it by coming off as kind of standoffish until people actually approach me/I approach them. You‚Äôll come off as well cool and people will love you, it‚Äôs the basis of being an ENFP, you gotta own your personality, and trust me it‚Äôs easy to, we‚Äôre born to do it.
6	This all has to do with the enneagram. Most ENFPs are type 7s, and this enneatype is what you‚Äôre describing; however, there are other enneatypes for ENFPs.\nAnother common one are 2‚Äôs. They focus on others to a chronic degree. 2‚Äôs will have you believe their intentions are selfless, and are equally imperfect as the 7. No perfect number on the enneagram! I‚Äôve also heard it said type 2 ENFPs are more like ENFJs. Type 4 ENFPs are more like INFPs, so on and so on. Hope this helps!\n\nAlso I relate to this post as a type 7. 
6	I started to pay more attention to my own needs - if I dont want do anything, I dont most of the time. But there are moments when I put myself away and eg I pick up the phone to my sick friend whom I know he will be only complaining and speaking whole hour only about his problems because I know that Im his only friend who he can trust 
5	I always put others first. so no . Not me. 
4	I would consider myself more self centered than egocentric, in the sense that I highly value independence and keeping myself happy, but I also am deeply concerned about helping others be happy in the same sense I would want to. I would never live my life in service of others though, and I do want to create an awesome life for myself. I just never want to tread on others or hurt anybody
3	We have Introverted Feeling as our second function which is concerned with ourselves, our values, and our emotions. So we are not necessarily interested in others or how they feel and most of the time aren't empathetic in the traditional sense, i.e. feeling what those around us feel, etc.\n\nOn the other hand because we have looked at our own values so much and because we lead with Extroverted Intuition and thus can see every possibility and pattern we can easily imagine how we would feel in any situation. We naturally can walk in anyone's shoes and see things from every side and understand (if not always agree) with any position and how they got there. So this is how empathize, we put ourselves in another's shoes. We try to give them what we would want.
3	I'm most certainly an egoist. I just have really low confidence :/
3	Yes, my parents have always said the same thing! I can‚Äôt tell if it makes me an asshole either. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs something that can be worked on so it doesn‚Äôt affect relationships, but I think it‚Äôs something that‚Äôll always be there and that‚Äôs okay.
3	A balance. I like to self care because if I don‚Äôt take care of me I can‚Äôt help others 
3	Sometimes I feel like I'm so quick to put others before myself because it feeds my ego/makes me feel like a "good person"
3	I tend to put others before myself but I‚Äôm an egoist in the way that I‚Äôm a little self absorbed. Like I will go out of my way to help people before ever helping myself, but I really like talking about myself and that‚Äôs something I‚Äôm trying to change
3	I'm definitely the total opposite. I put others needs ahead of my own to my detriment. I guess my brain thinks "trickle down happiness" is a real thing; if I can help those around me be happy, I will be too. 
3	I always feel weird commenting here because I'm not an ENFP, but I feel like I'm in a unique position to answer this question without much bias!  I don't think you're egoists.  (Weird word.)  If anything, the ENFP's I know are the first to apologize just to avoid conflict.  No pride there!  You'll also overschedule yourselves to the point of exhaustion just to make time for everyone and you'll go above and beyond when someone needs you. You guys can just be a little oblivious sometimes.  I hope it's not insulting to anyone, but I tend to think of you as big puppies.  You're happy go lucky and super stoked to be doing the things!  You just don't happen to notice that you're stomping all over someone's feet until they start yelling about it.  Then you tuck your tails between your legs in genuine sadness and remorse because you just wanted to share with your friend and you didn't realize you were hurting anyone in the process. 
4	I think ENFPs, like any type, can be selfish when they are unhealthy. They are also Fi users which means that they will usually stick to their guns.\n\nI‚Äôve noticed that they are usually self preservationists who will make sure to meet their needs. But they will also helps others in need as long as it doesn‚Äôt cross their basic boundaries. They can be needy and clingy when they feel that they constantly lack something. It usually stems from wanting positive experiences and emotions but unable to figure out how to sustain them. 
2	Not all of us, but like any type we all have the potential to be; I believe we can all be egoists (all people), and for some it‚Äôs become a regular practice and a part of who they are. \n\nI do have to say though, one of the most Narcissistic guys I know is an ENFP. On the other hand, I know a few other ENFP‚Äôs that are the most compassionate, agreeable, empathetic and service-oriented people. \n\nAnyone ever wonder if this category is a Granfaloon masquerading as a Karass? 
2	Nope. Not at all. I don‚Äôt let people walk all over me (or try at least) and I‚Äôm not the most selfless person I know, but I would say a definite majority of the time I put others needs first. 
2	I seem to always put others more than me to the point, I usually accept blame for things that aren‚Äôt my fault and try to please everyone at my expense. I can accept when I‚Äôm wrong
2	We all have something that makes us selfish and things that we do that makes us come off as egoists.\n\nI dont consider myself to be one.\n\nIve run into people in life that are verbally and emotionally abusive that would say i was egoist or selfish. Pay close attention to what they say.
2	I‚Äôm all or nothing- seems all my energy goes into others, or it all goes to me and mine.  
2	In France you can get a perfume called "egoiste" , my French teacher showed me a commercial for that shite and I'll never forget it. Also the english translation of the French word for perfume is toilet water.\n\nEdit:\nhttps://youtu.be/qRA7B3GGdME
2	I have the exact opposite problem. 
2	Hm.\n\nI'm usually perceived as too accommodating, if anything. One of the thing I've been trying to be is more selfish, actually. I love feeling like a really, really, really good friend, so it's really easy to sometimes forego my plans and jump to their side. (Which I still do/love doing -- just try not to in excess, I guess).
1	Yeeeaaah I‚Äôm an egoist
1	Yeah because we're special ok
1	Perhaps when I was a young adult, yes. I fly a little closer to the ground now. I've experienced too much heartbreak to be selfish. 
7	MBTI Research Survey	Hello all, recently I have been very curious in conducting some research on the MBTI, and seeing if perhaps anyone would be interested in the creation of a new centralized MBTI community.\n\nI have created a survey for you all to take, I would very much appreciate if you guys took it, thank you all so much in advance!\n\n[https://goo.gl/forms/Alu5VPDrbmGBfvGL2](https://goo.gl/forms/Alu5VPDrbmGBfvGL2)
1	Hello all! Please continue to take the survey and thank you for all of those who have replied thus far! When I‚Äôve acquired a large enough sample size, I plan on sharing the results in a large analysis and discussing what we want as a community and where we can move forward from here!\n\nThe analysis will be found on r/mbti\n\nWe have the makings of an ambitious project here! Godspeed.\n\n-jumbojet555
3	Is being self-centred an ENFP trait?	So I don‚Äôt mean self-centred in the traditional way, I would like to think I put others before myself and do what I can to help my friends and people that may need it. However, I am so obsessed with what everyone thinks of me that I find myself telling little white lies here and there so no one thinks I‚Äôm a bad person.\n\nI have never considered myself a dishonest person but there are truly some things I find it hard to admit because I don‚Äôt want it to change someone‚Äôs perspective of me. Plus I have different personalities for different people, so much so that I‚Äôm not sure which one is the most like me. \n\nDoes anyone else find this? Is there anything I can do to maybe not feel so insecure or so obsessed with what others think of me? 
9	I‚Äôm 100% with you, apart of our personality is our desire to be liked, so naturally we care what people think about us,\n\nand some of us, including myself will go to some extreme length to achieve that, such as putting on a different personality for different people, its just part of who we are as people
7	I think you're describing our ability to be chameleons--to quickly read people and situations and adapt to them and speak the same language. This is an ENFP superpower in my opinion. Contrary to being self-centered, it shows an ability to be oriented toward others--to have room to take in their thoughts and behaviors and relate to them. \n\nYou're making yourself miserable by valuing approval and being liked so highly though. Approval from others can change on a whim, even in the workplace. The thing is, **your value never changes**. There's no one like you. You are unique and wonderful, no matter what happens. So go out there and be you.
3	This is my first ever post on Reddit so this is yours I believe. üçíüôÇ I couldn‚Äôt help but respond to this thread though as it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been thinking A LOT about recently.\n\nSo, I totally get it and I‚Äôm also very guilty of doing similar things myself. As someone else above has already pointed out, part of our personality is the fact that we‚Äôre very likeable but also that we‚Äôre extremely amiable. We don‚Äôt like conflict much. All of this coupled with our endless enthusiasm for... well... everything, sometimes leads us (read me) to tailor who we are to our audience. \n\nThis isn‚Äôt a thing I always even do intentionally but when I do it‚Äôs because I think it‚Äôs easier to show people the part of me that they‚Äôll most identify with rather than overwhelm them with ‚Äòme‚Äô immediately. Thing is this almost exclusively only happens around people I LIKE as opposed to people I just like. The problem is people then only get a one dimensional view of me and I end up feeling disappointed and ultimately pretty broken when the person I have feelings for doesn‚Äôt feel the same as me when they only partially know me. I‚Äôm also terrible for absorbing their interests. Sometimes to the degree that I‚Äôll put my own to one side.\n\nI‚Äôve only come to realise a lot of hard truths about myself in the last couple of years after a bit of a identity crisis to be honest (following the sale of my childhood dream business). It caused me to take the time to really consider who ‚ÄòI‚Äô actually am now (in my early 30s). I‚Äôve read a lot of different books and I‚Äôve made a lot of mistakes along the way to discovering I‚Äôm almost certainly polyamorous in my heart of hearts (which many including my long suffering INFJ girlfriend would argue is maybe just another aspect of my self absorption).\n\nThe thing is I feel happier now. A little anxious still admittedly but far happier. üòÖ I‚Äôm no longer playing the roles that I previously felt I needed to assume and I‚Äôm not hiding elements of the ‚Äòme‚Äô I feel I am from the people who‚Äôre important to me. It‚Äôs also made me realise that I need to really work on my weak points.\n\nI‚Äôve started to utilise our Tertiary Function, Extroverted Thinking to actually assert what it is I want instead of fearing that being my inner ‚Äòme‚Äô will only cause disharmony. I‚Äôve also started the difficult process of integrating our Inferior Function; Introverted Sensing. I‚Äôm no longer clinging desperately to parts of me that I‚Äôve perhaps outgrown without even realising it. It‚Äôs not been easy but it‚Äôs definitely been worthwhile. If you can have a read of the following. Even if not immediately, I feel like they‚Äôll eventually speak to you in a similar way they have to me. The first one is especially relevant.\n\nThe Courage to be Disliked - Ichiro Kishimi & Fumitake Koga\nA New Earth - Eckhart Tolle\nThe 16 Personality Types - Dr. A.J. Drenth\n\nI hope this in some way helps!\n
2	I used to have Social Anxiety Disorder for most of my life so I know what you mean. I never wanted anyone to dislike me, which is different than wanting people to like me. I was ok with people having neutral feelings, just not dislike. I would never do or say anything to cause any embarrassment or for anyone to judge me. The result was I never did anything and had no friends. I still have no friends.\n\nBut thankfully in recent years I have gotten over it. I guess it is maturity mixed with exposure to a lot of people and having a girlfriend, etc. I used to always be wondering what everyone thought but now I don't think of it. And I don't care what people think of me. After all that's just their opinion. And if they say something well words are just words. If someone thinks or says something bad about you either it isn't true, in which case don't worry, or it is true, in which case don't worry.
1	Yeah I guess so. I just feel so conflicted about it üòÇ
4	How do you act around people you‚Äôve never met?	I‚Äôm just wondering how my fellow ENFP‚Äôs condone themselves around strangers, there‚Äôs definitely more than one way, especially for us, me personally I always come off as very stand-offish until I actually approach/get approached.\n\nThis while it may not seem normal for us is more my instinct to come of as socially desirable and 110% is because of my manipulative nature. I find that I like to feel like I‚Äôm exclusive but letting people in and talk to me let‚Äôs them feel like they‚Äôre lucky to have me. Its quite odd if I‚Äôm being honest, I don‚Äôt know too many ENFP‚Äôs that act like myself 
18	This is certainly a bit off topic, but I've been noticing how negative we've been about ourselves on this subreddit lately... Posts implying that we find ourselves selfish, egocentric, manipulative, easily offended... I just want to say that while it's good to have a healthy dose of self-reflection done and work on yourself constantly, there's no need to put yourself down! Everyone is selfish sometimes and everyone can be a bit manipulative. In the end, I feel that our general personality is still very desirable amongst others, and there's no use in dwelling on the negative. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow as for your question, it depends on the setting. At a party or big event I'll be outgoing from the get-go, and use my existing connections to make new ones, or improve the ones I already have. At work - like say starting a new job - I'm very quiet until spoken to, mostly because I'm trying to get a general feel of how people behave in said workplace. I feel a lot less comfortable just being "loud and proud" in a professional setting. :') 
6	i‚Äôm excited and friendly around strangers (perhaps more so than with my friends) bc i love getting to know and meet new people. each stranger is like a mystery to unravel you know?? afterwards when the novelty wears off i kind of just mellow down and show them my more serious side. anyone else feels like this? i don‚Äôt think this could be an enfp thing so i‚Äôm just putting it out there
4	It takes me a little bit to feel things out before I go full throttle. Also, when I‚Äôm first getting to know someone, it always feels performative. I feel like I can‚Äôt just relax.
4	If i have some other people i know and i am comfortable to being around them, i usually am myself and curious, if by myself/surrounded with people i don¬¥t know that well i am usually quite quiet, reserved and shy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI should really get rid of behaving that way (i mean last mentioned), it is annoying me because i don¬¥t feel that i can express myself properly.
2	New people? They say you only get 1 chance to leave a good first impression. But I actually feel like I only get one chance to mess with people before they know me. \nI usually go in hot and joke around with people right off the bat. Keep conversation flowing etc. once everyone is talking and relaxed, I fade out. \nIntrovert usually appreciate the part where I shit up, but they usually take over from there. 
2	I act like that! And for the same reasons.
2	EITHER SHY OR CRAZY GOOFY, THERE IS NO IN BETWEEN
30	Friends went out w/o me & this night has been tough. Made this to let my negative feelings out and just needed to share it (also yes it's not finished lol typical)	
3	Okay love this 
3	This is great
3	Fuck your friends. Also, this is dope. Keep the project going.
1	This is beautiful!!! 
5	Which personality gels perfectly with an ENFP for a friend and a romantic relationship respectively?	The personalities can be same for friendship and romance
13	From what I hear, INTJs, INFJs, and some others swear up and down about INFPs.
7	I got my boyfriend to take it back towards the beginning of our relationship. He got INFJ. We‚Äôve been together for almost three years and he‚Äôs my best friend!! 
6	Friendship wise, I absolutely adore ENFJs and INFJs. They‚Äôre usually very interesting/easy to talk to, incredibly kind, and very good at planning things to do. \n\nRomantic relationships wise, Ive always been attracted to Introverts and Thinkers. Although some feelers here and there. Longest relationship was with an ISTJ. 
3	A lot of people like to say ISTPs, INTPs, ISTJs, and INTJs. Personally, they're a bit too much of stick in the muds for me. It all depends on what you look for in a friend, I guess. Many of the other ENFPs I know tend to prefer ESFPs, as they convince them to be more adventurous without getting in their own head about it. For me, I like the ability of an ENTP to match my sort of "bouncy" nature from one idea to the next, while still keeping me thinking rationally and logically. Once again, it's really all up to what you look for!
3	I've made some wonderful friends out of INTPs and INFPs. They'll make fun of you but they love you.
4	No personality gels perfectly with an ENFP.  There are so many aspects of live that to be perfect in all of the things is impossible.\n\nLet me give an example.  In some aspects one type may gel well with an ENFP is the INTJ, but it is far from perfect for ENFPs and INTJs mirage / illusionary partners.  That means they gel great at a distance like you are doing a relaxing activity and you just get to talk about things.  ENFPs and INTJs love to go on vacations together and they have so much fun at these things.  The ENFP and INTJ do not stress each other out for their "judging" of each other often understands why the partner did what they did and they accept their partner.  There is a lot of comfort, lots of mutual sympathy.\n\nBut when something is not far, when something is not abstract, but instead close, concrete, and sensory ENFPs and INTJs are ***sucky helpmates*** for the ENFP, what each other needs is a different aspect of the sensory domain.  What energizes them, what they need from the environment is foreign to the other type.  An INTJ tries to help an ENFP with what the ENFP but they are just too alien to each other.  It is like a fish giving a bird words of advice on how to swim better when the bird is meant to fly and vice versa.\n\nIronically how an ENFP and INTJ fight can be a problem.  Often they do not fight much and when they fight they just move on and forgive each other.  This may seem idea but sometimes it is not.  Here is why.\n\n* Communication is not merely about being interesting, as the purpose of communication is to be useful, language for the most part is about language use. (Contrast this with other ideas of language about accuracy and precision, grammar, and so on.)  Fighting can help synchronize the partners and help them to come to a realization of what the other partner needs, to synchronize them, to mobile and activate them.  ENFPs and INTJs fights rarely do this, so they rarely fight, and when they do fight they often move on and forgive each other but they also lose the opportunity to use the fight to cause to some form of **reconciliation** or **synchronization.**\n\n----\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEvery single type combination has some form of problem, literally there is no type combination that is "perfect."  So where do we go from here?\n\n* First, You learn to realize that relationships are an active process and it is about growth and be--**coming** instead of natural be-**ing.**  If you meet someone who is your soulmate they are not naturally your soulmate when you first meet them.  They be-**come** your soulmate.  It is the difference between raw cookie dough, raw ingredients prior to mixing, prior to baking.  All types need to learn and improve their weak functions (so with ENFP this is Te and Si) but also their weak shadow / subdued functions (Ti and Se.) The only way to do this is via experiences, and being exposed to situations to improve them.\n\n* Second you learn that friendship and romantic partners are great, but you supplement your energy needs with other people.  So your romantic partner may provide you with 75% of what you need in external relationships, but with the other 25% you get it from friendships or other external relationships.  Furthermore there may be some overlap where your romantic and friends partners both provide you things you need and they both can help you with that need.\n\n* Lastly and this is the counterpart of the first, you realize you yourself are constantly growing, constantly becoming, and so on.  What you think your needs are at 18 is different at 24 and it is different again at 30.  You yourself are a work in progress and things that used to be impossible become easy or medium to do.  Furthermore you learn to self supply certain energies that you used to rely one external people to supply.
3	Personally I tend to get along best with ENFJs, INFJs and INTPs. Haven't had many good experiences with INTJs as friends or dating relationships, despite all the hype about them being the perfect match for ENFPs.
2	I would think and ideally will find another ENFP. Because all the traits I am looking for, openness, honestly, non-judgment, silliness, humor, romantic, sweet, childlike, likes potty humor but also sophisticated humor, talented at most things, interested in a lot of things, always learning, not too extroverted, not too introverted, etc. are all me too. Others seem to want an opposite but I'm dating an ENTJ now and we literally disagree and fight about everything. I just want a deep silly romantic.
2	Well, my most treasured friends are 2 ENFPs, one INFP and one ENFJ. \n\nWith ENTPs and INTPs, it's either going to be perfect or it's gonna suck, there's no middle ground.\n\nI haven't had an ENTJ friend but I like INTJs a lot.\n\nNot many sensors in my friend groups... However, I have a friend who is ESFP and I love his energy and we have a pretty similar sense of humor.\n\nAs far as romantic relationships, well, I've had a relationship with an ENFJ and an INFP, and plan to ask an ENFP out (wish me luck \^_^ ) \n\n
2	So the general rule of thumb is that INTJs are our best fit (although rational IN types are the bees knees). Tellingly I‚Äôve been with one for 14 years now and despite our differences (including me occasionally falling in love with other rational types. Specifically other INTJs and INFPs) we‚Äôve stuck together through thick and thin. \n\nI will say though, the idea of trying to mesh specifically with another type ‚Äòbecause you‚Äôre a perfect match‚Äô is dangerous and ultimately self defeating. Especially if it‚Äôs to try to compensate for your self identified ‚Äòfailings‚Äô.\n\nI crutched for years on my girlfriends ability to be the planner and doer I never thought I could be and it prevented me from developing the skills I need in areas where she wasn‚Äôt present. Now I‚Äôve realised that I need to take responsibility for my own personal development our relationship has started to improve greatly. I now make plans and take on responsibility, even if it feels uncomfortable because I know it‚Äôs a necessary life skill. She now knows that she can‚Äôt solely rely on me to be the sociable one. We support each other in developing these traits in ourselves and we‚Äôre both happier for it.\n\nAs for friends my bestie is actually also my first love and she‚Äôs an ENFP too. We‚Äôre effectively Gemini twins. :D We also drive everyone else and each other to the brink of insanity the majority of the time. XD
2	i love INTPs, ENTPs, INFPs and INFJs!
11	i have friends but at the same time i have none	context: i have social anxiety (i observe a lot of enfps do as well).\n\ni realise i've never had a lot of friends, but was never friendless either. i've had some pretty close friends, but they never felt like real friends. or rather, i felt that they could easily abandon me for someone else. as in, i'm never anyone's first priority. as in, i feel so lonely all the time because my so-called 'close friends' don't really care about me at all. \n\nthey all just want someone else. but not me. i crave for that one who wants me. 
8	I‚Äôve always have had a wide circle of friends  & acquaintances, but have always felt like I‚Äôm on the outside looking in. It has nothing to do with reality just my perception. 
3	I had really bad social anxiety from 13-20. However I somehow always had friends/girlfriends. I think a really reclusive/anxious /inward reflecting ENFP exhibits more of an INFJ type. \n\nNow, I'm almost 24 and way more outgoing. Twice as confident. My anxiety is probably a 3/10 compared to 8/10, yet I really don't have any close friends...or friends I do anything with, which is mostly my own doing to remove negativity. I was talking to/seeing a couple of girls recently but it ended somewhat in heartbreak. \n\nI can really relate to feeling like you aren't much of a priority. All my life I've had to be the main one to put in the work of a friendship. Then I realized that's the problem. Being needy pushes people away and annoys the hell out of them. \n\n It's easier said than done but not giving a fuck what anyone's priorities are is step 1, and self-improvement/growth is step 2 of improving your social life.\n\nI'm feeling pretty lonely too. It's been a rough last few months for me, but I know it's because I'm busy getting somewhere with myself in life and don't have time to waste worrying if I'm important to other people. \n

1	I think enfp is not really charismatic compared to enfj for example. Fi is kinda useless for that. We need really easy life, like "job: dad's son" to be those social creatures
1	This is me
1	I had Social Anxiety Disorder most of my life and never had friends after middle school and still don't. In college I had sort of friends through Theatre but we didn't hang out outside of Theatre stuff or parties. And nowadays I don't even have that. If I want to do something I have to do it alone or with my family.\n\nSo don't take what you have for granted. And if you can make some friends you can make others who might appreciate you more. I understand people just liking the fun, funny side of you but not the deeper side, I've experienced that as well. I guess the only way to combat that is to show your serious side sooner or right away when getting to know a  new potential friend.
