9	Someone needs your help	Hello, doing this is a bit hard for me, especially since I'm using my main account for extra trust points, I need one person to help out a person I know by befriending them online and listening to them, she is a 15 year old kid and feeling extremely bad, I came here because I'm an ENFJ and couldn't think of anybody better to help her I'd say she is an INFJ so if you talk to her she'll get really attached after she opens up, you have no obligation to help her, but if you could... then please, the only 1 specification I have is: please be a teenager and that's it, even if you couldn't help thanks for reading this far.
2	I’m a fresh adult, 18, but female and have younger friends? I’d be happy to listen and give advice, I used to be an INFJ so I get it.\nNo worries, but feel free to send me a message.
2	Sounds like she needs therapy and professional help.
5	INFJ needing help with an ENFJ	I'm an INFJ who has fallen hard for an ENFJ. We constantly flirted for a week now and I feel like we've connected deeply on one occasion. But the problem is I have a gut feeling shes not over her breakup with her ex 8 months ago. So I don't know if she geniunely likes me or using me to feel better. Should I stop intiating hangouts and let her come to me? Should I straight up ask to talk and say that it seems like she's going through some stuff and that I really like her and I only want to hang out if she truly wants to hang out with me? Or ahould I just not give a fuck if she's over her ex or not and be with her and make her happy?What should I do? Please give me some of your ENFJ insight and perspectives.
7	I’d openly discuss your concerns with her.  As an ENFJ, she will appreciate your honesty, be flattered that you care so much for her and frankly, help her confront what may be her own ambiguity about the situation. Plus, if your relationship is to last and have a future, it must be based on honesty, trust and good communication. Why not start to build that now? 
1	>Should I stop intiating hangouts and let her come to me?

Please give me some of your ENFJ insight and perspectives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnswers in order:\n\n1. If you feel really exposed and outside your comfort zone, that's probably a good move. You want to make sure your serious interest is reciprocated.\n2. I don't think so. Clearly she wants to hang out with you. If what you actually want is for her to admit serious romantic interest in you this move may be too much too soon and scare her off.\n3. I think you should just take things at a pace that you're comfortable with and enjoy her company. Give her a chance to come to you and you'll see if your interest is reciprocated. If you realize that her level of interest isn't high enough for you move on.
1	enfj’s are my weakness, I can relate 
1	Just be honest with yout feelings.
27	I tell people to get what they want, but I can't get what I want.	It bothers me that I tell people to get what they want, but I can't get what I want.\n\nI told a guy a few months ago to utilize his strength as a linguist, when he was applying for accounting jobs and failed. A few months later, now he's working in a language company.\n\nShared the same view with some guy on a road trip, he said, living on the edge, and yeah, he's living on the edge. \n\nTold somebody to expand and learn, and yes he did what I advised. \n\nBut when it comes down to my own personal problems, I find it so damn hard to plow through the people I need to deal with. As my persuasion is not working anymore with them.\n\nDon't know if you guys have met situations like this before and how did you deal with it?
6	I feel the same. I'm in my late 20s and am sill trying to figure that out. I've only gotten as far as thinking about the reasons why I do it:\n\n* I think to myself "it's ok, maybe I'll give it a little more time to play out".\n* Sometimes these situations are very uncomfortable and while knowing the logical solution, it's hard to pivot your life if it's already moving in a certain direction.\n* Sometimes these situations also involve intense interpersonal conflict. I avoid these where I can if I can try to find a way to rationalize or figure out an alternative solution. \n\nThe most success I've had in trying to "follow my own advice" has been just to stop thinking about it. I often talk myself in circles and psych myself out, but when I've been "ready" to accept that I need a change, I say: "I'm not happy in this situation. What can do I do to fix that?" and I just (almost) immediately do the first (and often logical) thing to do in my mind. It's like ripping off the band-aid as opposed to figuring out the most optimal way to remove the damn thing. You spend so much time thinking about it that it never happens. \n\nDoing this requires some mental fortitude and that you not overthink it. I've slipped up in the past, but just persevere and be comforted in knowing that you're either doing the right thing, or the thing that will maximize your happiness, or both. 
3	Because you have no problem with being a parent-figure for someone else, but not for yourself - I gave trouble with focusing on my self too, isn't the easiest to shift that focus back on myself 
2	Find a life coach or a mentor that you trust, or form a “mastermind” group with peers you admire and respect. Develop a life plan. I did this for a major career change in my late 30s. I am now 57 and love my work. My life is not perfect but what I have learned is everyone can use a coach. Even Olympians have one.
1	I wish I had some advice for you, but I know how you feel! 
1	I feel like that a ton, with a bunch of different situations. I find it hard to deal with people too, sometimes.\n\nEven with things like saying how I feel - I'll tell my friends to take the chance with a possible relationship (or even just a friendship they're particularly nervous about), but then I get too anxious myself to do the same.\n\nIt sucks. Because you can see objectively that it's the best strategy, and have strong feelings about it - but those don't always come out on top for YOU, even if you can communicate them to others.
3	I can't decide if I'm INFJ or ENFJ. What can help?	Ive always thought i was INFJ. I took the real,  paid MBTI test about 6 years ago and recieved INFJ. ive taken the free version a couple times since then and still recieved the same. I relate incredibly much to other INFJs and to the Functions they use.  But yesterday i re-took the test.  ENFJ. \n\nIve been trying hard for the past year to work hard on myself and fix many of the issues i have.  i made new friends,  i am figuring out what i want in life,  I'm overcoming my anxiety and depression. \n\nFor some reason i have never read about ENFJ before now and it has me questioning everything. I relate also so much to you folks and i need a way to decide.  What if i was just an unhealthy ENFJ this whole time?\n\nthank you very much :)
4	They look pretty much similar, the difference is Ni dom or Fe dom. if you are looking by stereotype, both look the same except :\n\n- INFJ isnt as emotionally expressive, in fact look more distant or logical with stranger. \n\n- INFJ has contradict desire either pleasing others or not to.\n\n- INFJ feel like they are complex and hard to understand why they are contradicting. \n\n- INFJ is more likely to self-reflect (unless ENFJ has illness that discourage them from going outside, they will often self reflect) \n\n- ENFJ is more pushy, more willing to take assertive action. \n\n- ENFJ has clear idea what to do with people and outwardly more decisive.\n\n- ENFJ is more natural and subconscious in their speech, INFJ looks like they are planning first before speak. 
1	Oddly enough I am struggling a lot with this today as well. I also took the MBTI and received INFJ. I took the online one multiple times and was always INFJ. However it has been a while since I had taken it, and I’ve had some lives changes that have made me happier & more outgoing. I just today retook the MBTI and received ENFJ. Took me as a surprise, but is a personality test. Although I suppose we are always learning and changing. \n\nAlso a close friend of mine is an INFJ as well. He has told me he actually switches back and forth depending on how introverted/extrovert he is.. not sure if this is possible but definitely interesting. \n\nAs for you, I would just ask if you’ve had any changes in your life? I’ll be following this to see, because I am curious as well. 
1	I tested INFJ for years as well. Then after being in therapy, and figuring out some of my depression and anxiety issues, and after a lot of work on dealing with them, I started testing ENFJ. I think a lot of people who are actually extroverts have social anxiety issues, and they believe themselves to be introverts. They aren't getting energy from spending time on their own and focusing on personal projects, but they're afraid to be around people, which can be especially compounded if you're the type of extrovert who really cares about how people see you.\n\nThinking back afterwards though, it made a lot of sense. My goals have always been family and people oriented. I've always wanted to do work that helps society, and I want nothing more than to have a loving family and to care for them. I enjoyed the idea of being part of a decent group of friends, and prefer group activities. I was just afraid to take part in any of that because of concerns over how I would be perceived and what would happen if I let someone down, so I forced myself to act more introverted, despite it making me miserable.\n\nI don't know how many people who test INFJ were in my position, but I can't imagine it's uncommon for ENFJs with social anxiety issues to believe they are INFJs. Being alone for the majority of our time can limit our ability to use Fe, making our Ni seem dominant, makes us feel introverted, and leaves us plenty of time to focus inwardly, since we're busy shutting the outward world away.
1	Try carefully reading through socionics profiles and seeing which ones you identify with. These are more detailed than MBTI ones which makes it easier to figure out your type.     \n     \n[INFJ by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=IEI_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [INFJ by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42491) | [INFJ subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/44198-IEI-INFp-Subtypes?p=40033&viewfull=1#post40033)    \n[ENFJ by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=EIE_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [ENFJ by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42485) | [ENFJ subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/4845-ENFj-EIE-Subtypes?p=103981&viewfull=1#post103981)    \n\n
16	Do you ever feel a little sad when you say goodbye to friends, even if you know that you'll see them tomorrow.	I always get this little "aaw, we won't see each other for a couple of hours" feeling, was wondering if it was an ENFJ thing. 
4	I hate telling people goodbye, even if I know I'll be seeing them that night lol.
2	Everyday haha! My friends always have a look of confusion and pleasant joy when I give them the biggest hugs even though it’s only been a day but I can’t help it! 
2	Yup. Always!
2	it may not be a universal enfj thing, but i will say this applies to me for sure! :'-)
2	Not really. It's more like enneagram 2 thing than ENFJ
1	Not really, if I'll see them tomorrow... although I feel like that also may be strongly affected by the friendships I have. I'm a grad school student and basically all of my friends from undergrad live across the state or in other states. I also have a group of friends who are closer to my house but still not super close (and they're far-ish from grad school, which is in the opposite direction, making it harder to meet up on evenings).\n\nSo with friends I do see more frequently, like the ones I go to school with daily, although I'd NEVER ditch them or undervalue spending time with them, I'm extremely glad just to be able to see them so often and go off and have fun relatively easily (since we're all in the same place during the day).\n\nI do definitely get sad if it's one of my friends that I don't see as often, though.\n\nAnd if not for the huge contrast in the frequency of me spending time with my friends (some I see 5-7 days a week depending on weekend plans; others it could be months), it would probably make me sad on ALL occasions.
15	Occurrences with the Poor	Less than a minute ago, I was approached my an elderly man in the bus terminal who said he just came from the hospital and missed his bus and needed money so he can get home. He even showed me his wristband from the hospital. I apologized to him and said I didn’t know what I could do. He asked me again and this time, his voice started to break and he sounded like he was about to cry.\n\nIt took every ounce of energy for me to tell him there wasn’t anything I could do. It crushed me to say that. In NYC, I run into less fortunate people all the time and it hurts me to see people suffer like this. However, I’ve been played before when it came to giving money to people on the street and had a fight instigated against me because I bought food for a poor man rather than giving him cash. It’s very hard for me to say “no” to these things but with my past experiences, I had to follow through in the same way out of fear that I was being played. I hate feeling conflicted like this.\n\nI’ve always had a dream of establishing a clinic to treat people who are struggling economically or at least help these people and give them hope to achieve great things. It’s tough and I’m not sure what I wanted to accomplish by writing all this but it’s tough to shake off these kind of things
6	I feel the same. My area has a lot of homeless people and honestly these days you can get in trouble for even handing out food to them. If you give them money, they can get violent asking for more. There is a ton of resource centers that provide help to these people, but they honestly don't really utilize them. Also some of them only want cash for things that aren't out of necessity. Its just not sustainable to provide help to every person, especially if you don't know for a fact whether they are sincere or not. The hospital tag could show the guys story checks out, but you don't know why he was in the hospital. It could be due to substance abuse or whatever. You never know. 
6	Where I live, I get approached by people asking for money all the time, usually when I fill up at the gas station and sometimes in parking lots of stores. It’s usually the same thing for all of them, that their car ran out of gas or they need some money for the bus. I respectfully tell them I don’t have money to give and they go on their way, but I have yet to have someone be aggressive. For me, I never give money, I just don’t believe that it creates a habit that’s sustainable for them to progress in life nor will he help with stopping the influx of panhandlers. What I will do is if I’m close by a fast food place, and they ask if I can get them something to eat, I’ll get them something to eat. 
1	I feel similarly, however I'd like to do this as a lawyer instead.
23	Any ENFJs ever have or had a really hard time breaking up with a SO?	I'm in a relationship and I'm really unhappy. I'm almost positive my unhappiness is tied to the fact that I'm unsatisfied, not getting what I need, and often being walked all over by my SO. I don't think he does it on purpose, but he can be extremely critical of me and sometimes really, really mean. Sparing the loads of examples, it's bordering on if not crossing the line of emotional abuse. Again, I don’t think he’s doing it to purposely be malicious. I think this is just who he is. \n\nHe is a real fixer-upper (As an ENFJ I tend to take on men who need fixing-up and end up tiring myself out) and has had his fair share of lady troubles in the past, including big issues with his mother. We've had a rocky road thus far with breaking up and getting back together, but over the last year we've been trying to seriously make it work.\n\nWe've talked up and down about how he treats me and how I don't like it. He doesn't change. I'm tired of feeling like his mother. I'm tired of being criticized and feeling like his friends or even strangers are more important than I am. I'm not seriously considering a future with him and I'm thinking about other men. My parents and friends don't like him and don’t want me to be with him. I love him, but deep down, I know this relationship is not going to last (and I don't really think I want it to).\n\nMy problem as an ENFJ: I feel like I'm sacrificing my own happiness for his - between his criticalness of me and the too-large portion of my brain I'm using to make sure he's happy, I've spiraled into the worst depression I've ever been in. But, I feel like if I break up with him I'm abandoning him (which he has told me I'm doing when I've tried breaking up with him in the past). I feel like I'm the only one who can take care of him, understand him and help him - he has taken so long to come around to trusting and being secure in our relationship, I feel like if I end things I'm going to scar him even further. I feel guilty even thinking about breaking up with him. I also feel like I'm afraid of making this decision and sticking with it, holding strong that I know deep down it's the right one.\n\nHave any of you ENFJs ever gone through anything like this? I truly believe my ENFJness is what is holding me back from finding what makes ME happy, because I'm truly too concerned with the feelings of my boyfriend. Since we’ve met I’ve lost that ENFJ “spark”. Everyone has told me that I don’t seem like myself anymore. No one around me can grasp why on earth I'm still with this person - it's obvious to everyone on the outside looking in that I'm miserable and why. If anyone can offer any bit of advice or support, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you in advance!\n\n**EDIT: wow, i did not expect so many people to reply and so thoughtfully. thank you all for taking the time to share your experiences and your advice. it's been a really tumultuous journey that i know i need to put an end to. i want to be happy. i know that i can be. i'm thankful for all of your support - i feel now more than ever that i can do this.**\n\n**again, thank you.**
10	hey, i just wanted to say i’m going through this exact thing right now, except as of a couple days ago, i have broken up with him. i felt like his mother, cleaned up after him, took care of his emotional needs, but where was my nurture? I know it’s hard and honestly, we live together so i face the guilt every day until I can find a new place. It’s hard when it doesn’t feel like he’s done anything “wrong”, but in reality, somebody doesn’t need to do something “wrong” to just not be the person you need and want. and that’s ok. that’s just dating, all relationships either end in marriage or breaking up. if you don’t see it ending in marriage, do both of yourselves a favor and end it. \n\ni fantasized about other guys, other futures, became really depressed and anxious, and lost little bits of myself i really valued along the way. since breaking up, and it’s only been a couple days, i feel rejuvenated and free. i already feel that fire we enfj’s carry inside of ourselves reigniting. \n\nyour happiness is first and foremost. it’s a hard concept to put into practice, being the caring and selfless person you are, but it’s necessary for your survival. \n\nlastly, what really sealed the deal for me, after i had broken up with him and felt really guilty, was this quote i saw, this one said: stop feeling guilty for outgrowing somebody who had the chance to grow with you, but didn’t. \n\nwish you all the best. please pm if you need to talk throughout it all, the ups and downs. \n \nedit: something i wanted to add: keep your eye on the future, and how good it will be for you and how much happier you will be, but avoid at all costs thinking about the past. if you think about the past, then you are more likely to get sucked back in with his attempts to get you back, as you will be thinking about all the good times, but ignore the bad times. \n\nexpect that he will try to guilt trip you, either by threatening suicide, calling you cold and evil, saying you’re abandoning him, etc. \n\nexpect that he will put on his good face and start kissing up to you. he will start being really nice, helping out, doing all the things you wished he would have done. just remember, if he does this, that he is now proving he was capable all along of being like this, and yet decided not to be, even though you made it clear that’s what you want. \n\nexpect that he’ll try to negotiate with you. hell try saying “let’s just give it a shot for another month,” etc. be firm and don’t be swayed. \n\nexpect that he’ll try, anyway, to breach the break up. he might still try to hug you, kiss you, etc, he might even say he’s only doing it because he just feels sad and really needs to be comforted right now, stand firm and, if it’s something you’re comfortable with, then don’t let it go too far. (i recommend not allowing it at all) when he does this, he’s trying to tap into that part of you that really hates to see someone sad and really wants to take care of them. it’s probably not conscious, but nonetheless, don’t be taken advantage of. \n\nsorry for writing so much 🙄
2	Wow, slightly similar situation, but I have a friend who I feel quite similar about. Everything you described I can relate to. The fact that he’s a fixer upper, has baggage from other people in his life, etc. Doesn’t trust anyone and always talks about how everyone in his life leaves him (and I have witnessed this happening and I’ve always been the one who has been there for him and reassured him that it’s not his fault). He’s a really nice guy and doesn’t criticize me or anything, but he has a ton of emotional baggage that he refuses to get help for because he won’t help himself. I feel like the friendship is really dragging me down, but I can’t bare the though of leaving him like everyone else. I think he actually thought I was different and was gonna stick around unlike everyone else in his life. It’d break my heart to prove him wrong. He was truly one of my closest friends and I love him, it’s just a difficult decision to make. So I feel you, OP. Sometimes the best decision to make is the hardest one and you just have to rip the bandaid off before you backpedal and change your mind once again. 
2	I had issues with this in my first few relationships.  One time I had felt like if I didn't stay in the relationship, my partner would want to commit suicide or something.  The thing is though, you shouldn't restrict yourself to being with someone entirely for their sake.  It turns into a toxic relationship that will end up putting a lot of stress and pain on you as a person.  In fact, you end up being their caretaker, not their partner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI eventually began to tell myself "pick your poison".  I weigh out the situation.  On one hand if I broke up with my partner, they'd be devastated and do something dumb like suicide.  On the other hand I would essentially become their slave and bend to their every beck and call for the rest of my life, being utterly miserable til the end of days.  So one thing is basically instantly ripping off the bandaid right away, and the other is like a super prolonged ripping of the bandaid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's my advice to you.  People are responsible for their own happiness.  Relying on other people to bring you happiness is not sustainable.  You can't control how people behave or act, and it's not your responsibility to.  The things your partner does is definitely not on you.  If they use you as an excuse to feel sorry for themselves or blame you for whatever situation they are in, that's not on you.  There needs to be reasonable accountability.  You can't hold yourself responsible for the dude's feelings and actions because whatever they do is THEIR decision.  People often feel guilty when shit happens and blame themselves for things they can't control.  I felt extreme guilt when my ex told me that they'd kill themselves if I left them.  In the end though, I came to realize that if they chose to do something like that because I felt we were incompatible, then that's something they chose to do.  I can't put blame on myself for indirectly "causing" it, and I deserved happiness as much as anyone else.  Understanding that what you're doing is not out of any malicious intent and knowing what you're accountable for will help you a ton. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFunny enough, for that particular ex, Cliche is correct, he did attempt to have "one last kiss" and we basically had 3 years of him trying to do more and get back together.  A clean break is recommended and cutting off all contact for a few months will help move things along.  If someone needs to guilt trip you into a relationship, they don't give two shits about you and just want to become a social parasite that feeds off people.  That's not fair to you at all.
1	I have a friend who’s in similar situation. She’s such a great person, so it hurts to see her so unhappy and really stressed out at times. We all make decisions that we regret sometimes, but I hope you find the strength to make those tough choices that will make your life a lot happier in the end.  \n\n\nWe all deserve happiness, the same goes for you OP.
1	I only been in one relationship and the thought of a break up would suck cause I don’t like hurting anyone but if I’m not happy or feel miserable because a person is putting me in a certain situation. I wouldn’t hesitate to leave them. You deserve to put yourself first. I think as a ENFJ we forget that cause we always put others before us. It’s okay for you to move on. Don’t feel bad. 
1	I went through the same thing with my ex. He sucked the life out of me as he grew into a (slightly) better person. He's a fucking man child and I care about him so much but I had to end things. Your happiness is THE MOST important and in the long run you're doing you both a favor. You will find someone who loves and appreciates you as much as you do them, and he will find someone he's actually compatible with. My ex, 3 months later, is still rubbing in my face how he hasn't slept with anyone else and how depressed he is and how he doesn't understand me. I try not to let it get to me but if I knew it'd be this hard I would have broken up with him long before. Good luck with everything, I know you'll make the right decision <3 we here for you 
1	Wow! I can totally relate. I don’t know if this is an ENFJ thing, but I suspect it is, I have issues with setting boundaries and feeling responsible for other people’s feelings and reactions.  I’ve done a lot of reading on codependency and boundaries and some counseling. I think my key learning is that only when I love myself to set boundaries and stay emotionally healthy can I really love the people in my life I care about the most. Once I grasped that, I didn’t feel like I was abandoning people who were actually taking advantage of my good nature.  That freed me to nurture others in a healthy way. 
2	ENFJ-ENFP relationship	I’m in one right now. An unemotional ENFP helps for an emotional ENFJ like me—of course, when I’m willing to actually spill the beans of what the hell is bothering me. The issues are basically stuff against myself, I’m way too much of a stickler for perfection and I end up wanting to shut everyone out when I can’t achieve it (and to think all these years I thought I was an ENTP! Heck. It’s a work in progress now that I know myself better.) Back to the topic, I like to read forum posts about other people’s experiences for fun (and to see if I can apply something new to my own life), and thus this post was born. What’s your thoughts and/or experiences?
2	I find it kind of weird for an ENFP to not be emotional as the F stands for feeler. Haha, I have a bunch of ENFP friends and probably had only one issue with an ENFP that was narcassistic.  I like ENFPs because they are fun to bounce ideas from and get different perspectives.
2	ENFP here. ENFJs are my favorite type, and also the ones that scare me the most. Every interaction I have with them is very intense, there's a vibe they all have that is on a different dimension; it deeply resonates with me. I think it's just the fact that we are so similar in type, but have a totally different cognitive stack. A lot of connection, but a lot of friction. 
1	as a female ENFP who briefly but intensely connected with an ENFJ male, i think that if the ENFJ is willing to open up, it could be a really beautiful relationship. I just found that he was constantly asking me to be authentic and vulnerable which in a connected safe space, i embrace with joy. yet i started to realize how he refused to be either vulnerable or authentic. he gave me a few conflicting statements that just make me believe he isn’t really ready to date for various reasons that make a ton of sense. \n\nthe intensity of the pain is not at all rational for the duration of experience. i hope we can reconnect someday. He was so hot and cold and it really started to hurt and finally the butterflies all died because i was constantly choosing to remain in something that didn’t feel good for me.   Sooo, the only option is to just feel like crap and get through that and then let it go. \n\nHe is a wonderful person though and I hope he is all types of happy. \n\n
2	Fellow ENFJs, how do you cope with feelings of despair?	Hi all. I will try to keep this short and to the point; my life is currently a complete mess in all regards. I'm unemployed, I barely have enough money to get by, and venting to the friends I've helped in the past doesn't seem to do anything, in fact their underwhelming response just leaves me feeling a lil worse after pouring my thoughts on them. \n\nI feel there's no way out. That there's no point in going forward anymore. The fact everyone seems to think I'm happy and strong certainly doesn't help, and I'm sure many of you can relate. Sometimes I just want to be loved, or listened to, but I don't think most of my current acquaitances is willing to be there for me. Why am I perceived as some kind of capable leader when I just don't see the point anymore? Music is pretty much what keeps me going, but it doesn't cpmpletely fill the void anymore. When I'm down like this, I feel the urge to overachieve in order to make up for my shortcomings, but I never do anything about it in the end. How do you motivate yourselves to keep moving forward and living to see one more day?   \n\n\nI'm sure everything will fall into place once I finally manage to get a job. That will cause a domino effect and eventually I'll be happy with my life, I just ran out of motivation to keep trying.   \nSorry if this is too bleak and/or out of place, but I thought maybe you guys could help me or even relate to my words. Thanks for reading :)
1	I get like that sometimes and it's nice to be affirmed and validated when we have these feelings.  Usually if I feel this way, I get to the core of the issue and try to solve it.  When you feel like you aren't achieving the goals you have set for you, it's hard to think positive. It's ok to feel sad and depressed sometimes, as you can't really control some things in life.  My motivation is knowing things will be better because I'll make it better.  In your case, being unemployed seems to be a big oof for you.  Solution is to go out and find a job, any job, just to get by and get that confidence going.  The worst thing for an ENFJ is feeling unfulfilled and not really providing any decent contribution to others.  We are really good supporters, so to feel like you make an impact in some way (be it flipping burgers, retail, desk jobs, or whatever).  My dad use to tell me that when you don't work, you basically don't have anything to do.  Doing nothing is what makes people bored and depressed.  Which is what happens to pets who aren't stimulated mentally and physically.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHappiness comes from doing things that you're passionate about and helping others.  Long term happiness comes from completing goals and tasks as well. I do have my bad days, but knowing I'm a good support for my friends and working to achieve my goals really makes me happy.  Usually things that bring down an ENFJ is not having people they can really connect with, not feeling validated/affirmed, and not having anything fulfilling in life.
1	I can completely relate, I have things knock me down from time to time, and I spiral a fair bit...\nI struggle with it until I have thought through stuff, not always productively, but then once I've had my thoughts go around for a whilst, I just seem to get to work, I set myself a small goal for an hour later, then I keep doing the same thing over n over until I get back I to a productive mind set and set the goals longer term. I do simple things, apply for 5 jobs online over this next 60 minuites, do 50 push ups and 50 pull ups over 60 minuites, make a meal, anything, before you know it things fall into place
25	Not taken seriously	Hi all! Hope everyone is doing well :) And hopefully I can explain this ok...\n\nDo any other ENFJ’s feel like their compliments aren’t taken seriously? I mean because we are stereotypically seen as people who are “too kind” and commonly try to compliment people, people think we are just being nice and we don’t mean them. \n\nI find myself getting frustrated when people assume that when I compliment them it’s not genuine. \n\nJust wondering if anyone can empathize and/or has advice to deal with frustration?
10	Yes, this happens to me!!! I generally find people to be impressive and am excited about their positive life updates, so verbalizing this frequently makes my compliments feel less meaningful. 
6	All the time. And the worst person at accepting my most sincere compliments and words of affirmation? Another ENFJ friend of mine! 
5	I don't have this issue, but it's something I've intentionally worked on as a high performance sports coach. I think the "niceness" of an ENFJ can almost make people uncomfortable who aren't used to complements. In my experience when you balance the positivity and optimism that comes easily to us with a willingness to be brutally candid then people respect your words a lot more.
7	I'm not an ENFJ, so from the other side it's probably a "them problem." I am suspicious of charming people and don't always believe good things people say about me, so I don't think you need to worry about coming across as fake! Being generous with kind words makes you a Good Person, don't stop!!
3	I tell people they're amazing constantly and I always mean it
3	You give the compliments, it's up to other people what they do with them... you can't control how they feel. All you can do is be kind, and be clear that you wouldn't give the compliment if you didn't feel it was earned. The rest is up to them.
1	I cannot count how many times I have been told "you are to nice." I don't have anyway to comprehend that because it is just what I do. I don't think it is us they disbelieve. I think it it a lifetime of not hearing the truth we want to offer. 
0	nope. my words are too convincing most of the time, people have a hard time to reject it. tho i have met one or two "insecure" people who cant feel good about themselves and its really not my problem :) 
6	This song makes my heart happy	
15	Memorable quote from myself in 2015	"People gotta know when to help themselves. Friends and family can provide support but if you aren't willing to take the necessary steps to better yourself,  then you can't expect anything to happen"
4	Yes, yes, yes!\n\nIt's tough love. And tough love is really tough for us ENFJs! 
2	Broke the unspoken rule of not talking about Reddit and posted a screenshot of this post on my social media. This is absolutely perfect. Too perfect not to share with everyone.
6	Halp me fellow ENFJs	
5	An inability and resistance to give time and effort to yourself is getting you to this place IMHO. As an ENFJ who's had life kick me in the balls a few times, I've had to commit to making things like health, well being and self inspection a priority. In answer to your hang up about wanting to control your future - wanting control, period - I always thought that letting go of control of things in my life would be problematic. I've learned that it's not as bad as I thought it would be and it's actually quite freeing.  But you have to. Where you are right now in life is not where you are ALWAYS going to be, and you will get to that point where you realize that those good things you have now really need to be appreciated more while they are still there. I've been there, living the 'life of Riley' so to speak where all the pieces are in place but not being good with myself AT ALL. You may have to turn to counseling, you may have to turn God or spirituality - but my guess is it's one or both of these things. Fill that void, because that void is only going to get bigger (like a cavity hollowing out a tooth) the longer it goes on.
2	I’ve countered this with taking time for self care (self reflection time, meditation, exercise, getting enough sun). Completely not letting the opinions of others guide my actions (true free action). And finally making sure I am doing things for others and giving them great experiences.\n\nThese things seems to all play a role in keeping my mental state at peak. The second one seems to be really important for us. Do not let others opinions drive us. Drive ourselves towards what we want. That plus giving others great experiences through direct free will seem to be a power play for self satisfaction in my experience.\n\nAll of this I realised after  examining the shadow and how it manifests in our lives. 
8	just wondering how ENFJs would respond to this	[u/throwaway3n1p](https://www.reddit.com/u/throwaway3n1p) and I are currently working on gathering answers for how thought processes work in different MBTI types. This is just out of curiosity, not an attempt to stalk you according to how you think of grave crimes. All replies are appreciated!\n\nIf we count judgments of *moral obligation* out of the equation, \n\nQuestion 1: How is murder logically fine?\n\nQuestion 2: How is murder logically wrong?\n\nNOTE: Feel free to write down whatever thought you have, whether it is emotional or just plain retarded.
4	Well there’s no “fine” or “wrong” with logically. Laws and stuff are all emotional at the start. \nPeople don’t want to lose their loved ones, religion, people feeling no one has the “right” to take another humans life. \nGood reasons, but emotionally driven. 
2	I'm gonna go with logically is the wrong word. Also, by murder do we mean the legal term, or simply the killing of another human being? There are some terms that need to be defined here first before I can give an opinion. 
1	Question 1: If the ends justify the means.\n\nQuestion 2: If they don't justify the means.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'm not an ENFJ, just stalking.
17	Becoming an improved version of our past selves	So I'm always looking for things to improve. How to get better at things, how to be better with people and in life. I'm never satisfied with the status quo, and I always hope for a better, brighter future.\n\nWhat are the things you constantly improve on personality wise, and how do you work on them? What drives you to improve on these things specifically?
10	Self expression is big for me. Being able to fluidly go from thought to reality to another person. I practice by writing and playing instruments. Conversations with others. Drawing. It can always be improved. I basically want others to feel the intense emotion I feel and show them what I am inside. Clear and cut channel to you
6	Great questions! \n\nI was a very emotionally closed off ENFJ until just recently. 3 years ago I moved to the other side of my state (roughly 780 miles away) for school. I was thrown out of the comfort of having my family be my everything, to having to take care of myself completely. While at said school, I started going to therapy (at request of my then girlfriend, now ex). Therapy truly helped me to open up, to be able to express how I was feeling, to the world. I was always the type of guy that would say "I'm doing fine, let's talk about you and your feelings," even when I wasn't feeling fine. Long story long, it was brought to my attention that I needed to open up more and share my thoughts and feelings, and I did, and I've been a better person for it ever since.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been practicing this new version of me by being as open and honest with my communication as possible, with everyone. Sometimes it's hard for me to do, but I eventually find the courage to speak my truth. I've found it's a lot harder on the psyche to hold onto negative (or even positive) thoughts and feelings rather than letting them out and sharing them with the world. I love sharing positive things with people, and it doesn't necessarily have to be about me. It makes me so happy when I could bring a smile to someone's face from my genuine positive words.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat drives me to continue this path of open, honest communication? The huge sigh of relief feeling I get when I've said something that was bothering me, or the fantastic mood I create for myself when I compliment someone on something I genuinely like about them.
5	Being kinder and not giving advice unless I am asked for it. Just because I can see clearly why someone is stumbling isn’t for me to point out unless they come to me and really want help. 
5	Communication, self-reflection, and being more forward. Thanks to my friends, I grew to become a more confident speaker and try to have that expand to things such as writing, public speaking, and being a conversationalist.\n\nI try to be more mindful with self-reflection and understanding my actions. It helps me to learn from my mistakes and take the necessary steps to improve my character. \n\nBeing more forward is something I struggle with but also want to improve more than anything. More specifically in the area of having the courage to tell someone how I truly feel about them. This is something that has eaten at me when it comes to romance and I keep trying to gain the confidence to one day not feel hesitant when it comes to those moments.\n\nI find ENFJs to always wanting to be the best they can do I’m glad I can read similar responses that others focus on
5	I'm constantly improving on how i deal with my surroundings, especially negativity and how to process it properly. I'm always looking for ways to improve myself mentally and physically and i try to apply that towards my social circles
18	Have you ever loved someone when there was initially no sparks?	I was wondering if anyone has been on a date/ started seeing someone and there were no signs of sparks? \n\nI'm currently seeing someone and although he's extremely extremely friendly, caring and a hard worker- I don't feel my heart racing/ butterflies like I did with my previous partner. We get along super well, very balanced and a lot of laughter. Is this something that can grow over time? 
27	It definitely is, but it's also a constant compromise. I have NEVER had a spark with my husband. We have been together 11 years. I respected that man from day 1, and that is something I had never felt before. Our morals, ideals, hobbies, all connect. \n\nThe sex life is where things get iffy. We have never had a real great one. We never want it at the same time. We are never in sync. When we DO have sex, it's actually pretty damn good. But it is a constant internal compromise of "do I give in just to get some sex for the first time this week, even though I'm not in the mood?"\n\nThe spark is sexual compatibility. The rest is the actual relationship. I am sometimes frustrated, but otherwise very very happy that I chose the relationship as a whole.
4	Yes. The INFJ girl I am dating was attractive and  interesting in first and second date, but only on the third date when we met alone and could touch and explore each other did sparks come. 
2	I haven’t. But to me personally I feel like it’s important. I wish there were more resources and information about the “spark” and what it really means though.
2	I am in an early stage of the same scenario- my partner and I have been together for a year an a half and are about to graduate college, and it's so weird for me to think about my relationship from another perspective.  We were and are best friends, get along very well, have very similar morals and dreams for our futures, but it really does feel spark-less in that regard and it frustrates and sometimes depresses me that I found someone who I can connect with in so many ways but maybe not the most visceral.  She's generally the one to initiate, and when we do have sex it's alright but it usually feels more like a chore...\n\nDo you have any tips on how to enjoy ourselves a little more?\n\nEdit- This was supposed to be a response to u/HotCuppaTeaOof , my bad!
2	A therapist once told me if you’re marrying for love, it won’t work. The respect for the person and the relationship is just as, if not more important that the “sparks” 
2	I was in a relationship where this was the case, we were together for 2.5 years and overall it was great. Although there was no spark, he was more like a best friend to me and I did whatever I could to make him happy, and that included having sex when I was extremely tired and even then, it wasnt the best sex of my life. I think I was blinded by his kindness and love to think that there's a spark between us, but looking back, I think I was trying to do whatever I could to believe in what he wanted to believe, that we were a couple with really good chemistry. It was really hard getting out of that relationship, only because I didn't want to hurt him at all. He's still one of the nicest guys I've met
1	Interesting post. Funny how you can meet someone and have an instant connection.  That happened to me recently, and it had been a long time.  But she did not feel the same.  I think it’s hard to find the mutual attraction thing.  And then, even if you do, it had to be maintained.  I think it comes from knowing ourselves well and then finding some of ourself in another...
1	I experienced that. When I first started dating my boyfriend I didn’t feel any sparks or and my feelings towards him were definitely not strong. However, the longer we dated the more I fell for him. We’ll be 7 years together this year. 
1	I was actually more interested in my fiance's roommate than him when we all first met.  The roommate made good first impressions and we seemed to have a lot in common.  However, that's like within the first hour of meeting them.  The more I talked to both of them, the more I gravitated towards my fiance.  Much later on, found that the roommate was not what I thought he was and turned out we don't really get along.  So I'd say, if you don't feel anything after a month of dating, then it's better not to force it if you don't feel it.  That said, my situation was that after talking to my fiance for several hours, sparks flew like crazy and it just went uphill from there.
35	this quote hit me. what are your thoughts?	"One can promise actions, but not feelings, for the latter are involuntary. He who promises to love forever or hate forever or be forever faithful to someone is promising something that is not in his power."\n\n\~ Human, All Too Human by Friedrich Nietzsche
4	To be faithful is action though, isn't it? Not feeling. One can be tempted otherwise but decide against it. I would also say that Love is a movement of the will. Love is the decision that you are willing to sacrifice for the good of another regardless of how you feel at the moment. Otherwise, it's not love; it's just a warm fuzzy feeling.
3	That is so human. ❤
3	I love that. And my thoughts are that this quote perfectly captures what’s beautiful about emotion. You can make yourself take action for any reason or combination of reasons, but true feelings, genuine feelings, are just what come to you and are inherently who you are. They’re pure.
2	Wow this hit me hard as someone who's recently made the decision to leave a long term relationship (we were engaged). 
2	Disagree. Even action isnt under our control, nobody knows when we are gonna die or get sick. 
2	Nietzche has a lot of good ones, usually those that predict the future (and came true). For this one I'd have to read the book itself, because you can never tell if he's being genuine or a sardonic ass.
4	How do I approach an ENFJ?	Hey, just a lonely INTP here. I've heard that our types are almost perfectly matched although I've never actually been close to one of you guys. So I have a few questions that might sound dumb, but the curiosity is eating me alive so I need to at least ask. Please be gentle, and honest, and objective, thanks.\n\nAssuming I chance upon one of you in the wild, how do I safely approach you to start a conversation? \n\nIf I do end up forging a connection (over time) that I feel is genuine, how do I tell you that I'm interested in you romantically?\n\n
7	You are approaching the master of socialisation and emotions. Relationship is our field, no need to worry on how to get into one with us. Just make sure you exist and stay within our range (visible to our eyes) then the "fate" will fall upon you.\n\n\nYou can confess directly, no problem. We genuinely treat people nice and if you are nice, higher chance we'll like you back. 
3	Assuming I chance upon one of you in the wild. Hahah that’s great I thought of Pokémon. \n\nBe yourself. Be honest. They will get you talking just be near them
1	I agree with everyone here, BE HONEST with your self, with your feelings, your surroundings, everything! I think that what makes us fall in love with someone because we are the realists of the world. If you'd like to romantically express yourself, I think the direct approach is the best way since we love "love" - this shouldn't be a problem :) all the best! 
27	Do you think it is an ENFJ trait to have empathy with animals (not just puppy eyes) and inanimate objects? I once genuinely apologized to a barstool for knocking into it.	
6	I don’t know if this just applies to everyone but I’ve always noticed this connection when it comes to dogs and babies. Whenever I’ll walk by a dog who is maybe barking, or has their head turned the opposite direction, or is panting, they’ll look in my direction with their ears down. Their eyes will track me and they’ll try to walk in my direction. \n\nSame thing with babies. They’ll be crying, or show some kind of distress and when I walk by, they always look make eye contact and smile/laugh. I see this happen *consistently*. Not sure if it’s just an ENFJ thing but it’s an interesting pattern 
5	I apologize to inanimate objects all the time. People chalk it up to my Canadian Ness but I suspect it also has to do with an enfj :) 
2	Totally. I once was on a road trip with my family and I had a cup of ice that I didn’t want anymore, so I contemplated throwing the ice out the window and felt so bad that it would be stuck in the middle of nowhere all alone.... 
2	ENFJ are so cute 🤗
2	I'm British so apologising to literally everything is pretty much part of my cultural heritage 😄
2	I wanted to be a vet initially and i'm an ENFJ so perhaps haha
3	I know of an enfj that has names for all her home appliances like Elena the hard working dish washer.  \n\nWhen one breaks she goes out and get the same appliance again. Even when it's the 3rd time to break because she feels emotionally connected to it.  \n\nI as an infp find this behavior very strange. 
1	Seems INFPs are infinitely more likely to cry over animals than any other type.
1	have never done this
1	Maybe a weak, broad Fe skew, but I doubt you're singling anyone out with that. ENTP and I do feel sorry for objects that shouldn't draw my sympathy.
6	Have you ever met an INFP you didn't like? Actually, couldn't stand?	Serious question and don't be afraid to get detailed on why things crashed and burned. Even I can only take the self-absorption of Fi for so long from other INFPs before I bounce out and seek out an Fe user. I know ENFJs have their limits too and a 'kind of' doorslam, just not as hard as the INFJ. What pushed you to bounce?\n\nEdit: I'm an INxP, and don't mind some straight talking.
4	Honestly, I love INFPs, and they’re my favorite friends and partners. At the same time, they tend to see the world first through the filter of who they are and what they need. Which can be pretty frustrating when your personality is about constantly working to be considerate about their needs, especially when it doesn’t always translate the other way by default. 
4	One of the best friends I ever had was an INFP. But she was a toxic and narcissistic one. Always with the subtle put-downs, making me feel like I was less than human, constantly needing alone time, but also being overly-needy, constant angry out-bursts...\n\nI could go on.\n\nBut after the last angry outburst in public which humiliated me, I was done trying to help her.\n(And since then I have learned what a real friend is supposed to be. Now I have better friends and am well-read on narcissism and toxicity)\n\nYears later she is still lonely and miserable with only one friend because she pushes everyone else away with her awful and childish behavior.\nAND she still trying to get into contact with me to try to have me in her life again smh.\n\nBut despite this, I still adore INFPs.\nI’m currently crushing on someone who I believe to be INFJ/INFP.
1	I was married to an INFP. He was very narcissistic and self absorbed. He was abusive and started to isolate me. But I’m the beginning and during the good times...oh boy, they were great. He was talented and creative and romantic and charming. But the bad was too bad. He was as intense as I was and it just evolved into a toxic codependent mess until one evening I left and then asked for a divorce. The separation was surprisingly smooth. It almost made me wonder if I was making the right decision. I’m so glad I left. 
1	Nope. But I have had problems with INFJs, with which ENFJs are supposed to be very compatible.
1	Survey on Personality and Flirting behaviors	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
1	This survey is too long man... But I did it anyway
3	How to turn it off?	Empathy always causes me to forgive others when they abuse me. How can I scale back the empathy and quit giving so damn much of me? 
7	Set boundaries and when you see red flags you peace out. I use to help tons of people who basically were lost causes. I learned to be a bit more selfish and know how to recognize bad ppl. Suppressing feelings and parts of yourself is not healthy. It's not fair to you to have to feel like you need to cut off parts of who you are cuz of ppl who take advantage of you
1	I found this so helpful, thank you! 
1	It's hard to turn it off but def setting boundaries and knowing you are not a superhero helps.

2	I felt like the HR manager is an ENFJ.	
2	I’m currently studying HR Management (will graduate in a few months) in a class of 29 people and a lot of us are ENFJs. How the HR Manager in this story handled the situation is exactly how it should be done. You want the employees to perform at their best so if they aren’t happy in their job/not producing their best work, you do what you can to help them, even if that means they will leave. Then at least you won’t have someone miserable and non-productive in the workplace. It’s a win-win for the employee and the business if you are compassionate and practical about what is best for both of you.
87	You are worthy of love... but so am I	
12	Wow. That hits close to home. 
8	Are all of us like this?
2	Shit
1	This is a nice quote. 
1	Love that.
1	Ouch. My heart...
1	This. Damn.
1	I can definitely relate to this
1	Is this a healthy way to go about relationships? If not what can we do about it?
9	What makes a connection authentic in your eyes? what are the qualities that look/expect on those authentic connections?	
4	Answering it shortly, I think all interactions are authentic. If someone is willing to talk deeply, that’s great and I value those interactions very deeply in my life. If someone is trying to take advantage of me, I tend to pick it up rather quickly- but I still see it as an authentic decision to act negatively, and I’ll know better in the future when interacting again with that person.\n\nAfter having met a lot of people, I realize that some people don’t open up much compared to others, but to them it might be opening up a lot. So I suppose for me, a connection is authentic if the other person is making the effort to connect with me. Qualities might include taking consideration of what I say, even if they agree or disagree; being at least somewhat engaged in conversation; taking time out of their busy day to meet once in a while.
8	Trying to be more ENFP	I fit the criteria and characteristics of an ENFJ down to the bone. Though, I believe I take life a little too seriously at times, and can be too organised and self-composed.\n\nENFPs are similar to ENFJs, yet seem to take life a lot less seriously. They appear a little more laid back and “go with the flow”.\n\nTherefore, trying to be a little more ENFP could potentially help me to be a little happier. Any thoughts?
4	I totally get it as a fellow ENFJ. Maybe you should post in ENFP subreddit? I wish I knew how to take everything less seriously, too :)
4	Aww no! How come you think being organized and self-composed are negative things??\nI’m an ENFP and my best friend is ENFJ and the things you described, are things I really look up to her for.  She teaches me so much about how to be more grounded, more real, more meaningful. \n\nBut now that you mention it, maybe since I saw these as your strengths I haven’t fully considered how it weighs on you...\nAre you really hard on yourself? Like you feel you _have_ to be organized and self-composed for other people? (I’m just trying to understand to see if I might be able to help. )\n\n
3	Don’t try to be more ENFP. IMO ENFJs are highly underrated. Just do a Google Image search for ENFJ and look at the overwhelming INFJ and ENFP results. My suggestion to you is to spend less time in dominant Fe/planning, and more time allowing Ni to develop your perceptions more broadly. Good advice for pursuing this can be found via the Personality Hacker website and podcast. Good luck. As an ENFJ, I’ve found more free-flowing, laid-back and expansive worldview by relying on my version of intuition (Ni). An ENFP’s version of intuition (Ne) will never fulfill us ENFJs. If anything, an ENFJ trying to force Ne might just feel selfish in the end. Go with Ni. Long live the ENFJ!
2	Why would you try to be someone else?
8	I got some awesome responses when I last posted a video... I (INFP) made this with my friend (ENFP) and we're sharing it with other NFs, hope you like it! :)	
4	Hahaha, I love this, just subscribed. Keep up the great work !\n\n\n\n\nPs: you're adopted. 
38	A new lease on life - Shamed into being INFJ & becoming my true self, ENFJ	I feel like a new person.\n\nI learned about the MBTI a decade ago when it was a requirement at work. The results were INFJ, and they rang true to me. As time passed, I even married an INFJ and became the admin of a meet-up group for INFJ’s. \n\nBut about 3 years ago, in the marriage, I realized how different my now ex and I really were. I loved him unconditionally. I have hope and optimism even when in the midst of extreme circumstances. Sex is critical to me. He was the total opposite in these things and so much more as soon as the honeymoon was over, even though he acted like they were real traits of his previously. We went to counseling, and the chasm of disparity was as wide as the ocean, so we got an annulment. \n\nI kept going to counseling and retook the MBTI a few months ago. ENFJ-A was the result. I didn’t believe it and wouldn’t consider it. \n\nTime passed. I have grown a lot and realized that I was shamed throughout my childhood about my intensity, my emotions, need for people, my artistic mind, etc. to the point that I shut down and changed who I was. I don’t do that anymore.\n\nSo last weekend after creating six new paintings in two days - yes, amazing - after not creating for soooo long, I was over the moon with exuberance. I prayed to be a beacon of light to all around me, and I got a nudge to retake the MBTI. I did, and I got ENFJ-A again. This time, I read through all the results, and it all fits. The weaknesses, how I operate best at work, etc.\n\nSo I came in here to proclaim how freaking happy I am that I finally found my tribe, where I won’t be told I am intimidating because of my accomplishments, where I won’t be shamed for my large romantic gestures, where I won’t be told I’m a weirdo for my pursuit of the best for myself and the whole human race.\n\nBe yourself. Be love. 
6	What an uplifting story! a fellow ENFJ says hi \^\^ 
5	What a beautiful story! Keep being true to yourself :D
4	So cool. Yea I test both ways I think I go back and forth between e and I depending on how my life is going. I tend to be more introverted but also love people and talking with them. In the end it is just a label and I am another person unique in so many ways. No mould could describe how I am
2	Welcome!!  Since you have experience in leading, are you open to a mentorship to a fellow enfj?  
2	I am also an ENFJ-A, don't ever feel ashamed to be yourself no matter what others think! It makes being yourself and living your life the way you want to so much more enjoyable and satisfying. I used to feel "off" when I was told I was intimidating and my old partner never enjoyed the work I put into big things that were important to me that I wanted to share with him. Now I found someone who absolutely adores all of my traits, it's wonderful!
25	So i just found out im an enfj.	So are we like the "personal growth" addicts? Like how can we be better at everything we do and how can we make everyone else be better at everything they do?
11	I definitely find myself to always strive on ways to improve myself. My primary focus in on always improving my communication skills and being personable to everyone I meet. I also tend to be conscious of my appearance because I think that ties in with the confidence and my energy with those I interact with.\n\n  \nFocus on improving the traits that you tend to use the most often. It's really about self-awareness and making an effort to improve upon your weaknesses. Practice self-discipline, set goals, and be transparent with yourself. In regards to helping other people, be enthusiastic and give them words of affirmation. Being genuine is the biggest thing here and it will lead to a lot of good if you speak from the heart. If they look nice, tell them. If you miss talking to them, tell them. If you care about them, tell them.
5	(ENFJ Male here) The best way for you to help others in my opinion would be a couple of things. First focusing on yourself and making an honest effort to improve your own situation. Second is to listen to others and let them know with social ques that you actually have a genuine interest in them. That’s where you can get others to open up initially. The last part is the hardest and that is to ask the right questions when they seek advice or your conversation goes to an abstract topic. My dad always used to say he judges a man based on the questions he asks not his answers. And as I have gotten into college this has applied the more mature I became. The more you try to help others the more they dig in their heels. However because we read motivations so easily ask the question that they themselves are not seeing right in front of them. Just make sure you know them somewhat well before you try and help in a way like that. BTW, Glad to have another ENFJ in the fold! Welcome!
2	For me personally I try to do everything more, whether it’s work, school, hobbies or even relationships I always try to put in more effort than anyone is used to. Sometimes it’s not taken well and everyone thinks I’m trying to suck up to whoever’s  in charge or in the relationship aspect sometimes it can make the SO feel like they aren’t contributing enough, which is a very shitty feeling and I’m still trying to work that part out. \n\nAs far as bettering people around us, I just try to be as understanding as possible, if people around you feel comfortable they tend to do better and that applies for most things in my experience. 
1	Yep. Personal growth addict right here. I am always consistently every day trying to make improvements in all aspects of my life; not only to help me but also to help others. Though I’m mainly aiming to be more self-sufficient these days.\n\nI’m always learning new recipes, watching educational yt videos, and reading books and articles on/offline of various subjects, etc just so I can be the person I know I can be capable of being.
6	reasons why I like ENFPs as partners or friends even though an online article told me it was a bad pairing	thoughts?\n\n\n1) our 1st and 6th functions complement each other. I like that the primary lens that my partner uses through life is a vital tool in my method of critique and self improvement and vice versa. \n\n2) my Se drives me to maintain the tangibly pleasing environment that the ENFP envisions and desires from Si, or to help them turn dreams into plans in general.\n\n3) their Fi gives them strong boundaries about what they're comfortable with; I know I won't get ahead of myself making decisions because they'll let me know if they really want it another way.\n\n4) my Ti is satisfied because they make me feel logical and structured when other types may see me as chaotic or erratic. I don't mind being the weird friend but it's nice to have an ENFP around who gets me.
3	ENFJs in sales	I am now in the sales side of my industry after 20 years of experience in the administrative side of the business.  So I have a solid grasp on the actual industry itself, but 0 sales experience.  Any of y’all in sales?  If so,  how have you used our enfj style in your cold calls?  
2	I work in sales, but not really in the cold call industry. At least, my strength is not in cold calling. I rely heavily on leads. I am really good at closing just about any lead that comes my way, but I suck at true cold calling because all I can I think about is how much the person I am calling doesn't give a damn about our services. I feel like that because I hate when people try to sell to me like that. \n\nMy previous job, that I miss a lot, was more of an account management sales job. Our company sold huge manufacturing equipment projects, and after it was installed I was the customer's point of contact for getting replacement parts, drawings, etc. I thrived in that role, but left for a job that pays more. I often think about going back because that position really maximized my individual strengths. No cold calling. It was awesome.
1	I cold call daily as a lead generation source (I do residential real estate sales). I would say my personality really comes out when I empathize with others and get them to open up about their situation by asking them meaningful questions and shifting my tone depending on how they’re responding and what they’re saying. I use empathy and tonality a lot on my appointments and calls. Every enfj is different tho, so just study the best and go with whatever you feel most comfortable with.
11	Thoughts about infps	It'll be nice if you guys could give feedback on us INFPs,maybe focusing on the good/ bad qualities of them in depth(if possible) ,also maybe first impressions when meeting them,your experiences with them as well. On a side note,you guys are lovely ❤
6	Good listeners and authentic people. If you look up INFP in the search bar of the sub, you’ll find A LOT about what we think about them
3	Very good listeners, open mineded and self sacrificing but a bit too introverted, have a very poor ability of confrontation and a bit too sensitive, I've only had 2 infp friends and this is how they were
2	ngl this comes up every week or so in this forum. just search it man. 
2	good as friends 
2	Smart and adorable and (ime) kinky until you say something they disagree with
1	We love to eat INFP betas for breakfast
1	Milton Friedman - do you know a smarter intp?	
12	ayn speed dating	
48	As an ENFJ, does anyone else feel they hide their true self to protect/please others. I find it is hindering closeness with others. Thoughts?	I have always felt like there is a whole world inside me that I hold back from most of the world. I only let some people in once I truly trust them  to see who I really am. I am super self aware when I am around new people, especially people that I have "put pressure on" to impress... which is something else I do a lot - romanticize people and relationships. Also , I'm always trying to keep relationships "perfect": acting nice, and trying to seem chill and fun. But when people really *really* know me, they see I have a whole range of states -- from super fun and light hearted to a full-rath-rage that can easily be tickled lol. I wish I could show all of me old and new friends alike, but I don't want to let anyone down. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo as an ENFJ, I think this make sense but it also contradicts itself. Because being an extroverted type we of course want to be around people. But I think the people pleasing/giving qualities put pressure on us to always be performing and providing the entertainment. Which in turn makes us nervous about letting people down, makes us keep our guard up, and keeps us from what we need -- which is authentic connection. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way?
16	The guy i’m seeing right now is like this. I complimented him once on who he “truly was” behind the front he puts up and he started crying... y’all are really beautiful people, and it’s really important for you to know that. You can show who you really are!! The world will only be better from it. :) 
10	I completely get this! I'm super open but I was in a relationship with a guy who was just so, so different. It made me more quiet and contained and although I loved him, I could be more open with my friends than I was with him. He came from an abusive childhood and was very negative about the world, and as an ENFJ, it completely suppressed me and made me hide my emotions (even though he didn't have any intention of doing that) But I feel like as ENFJs we can suppress/let out all of our emotions and true selves depending on who we are with 
6	I often do this. I am at heart a people pleaser and I often feel like if I let my true self show then it won't be pleasing. Like, most people don't know that with a select few people I am way different than I am with others. I do that because those few have shown their unconditional love for me and that gives me the freedom to be me. It really is a sad testimony that I don't feel comfortable being myself around others but it is the truth. 
11	To all those saying “yes we are like this”... well yes, an underdeveloped ENFJ is.\n\nAt the most, different people should spark slightly different sides to you – this is normal. You won’t (re)act the same to different people. Humans interact a bit like chemicals in this way. However, if you find yourself changing your core values or completely flipping who you are and how you act around particular people, either or both of two things are happening:\n\n1. You are unbalanced and unsure of yourself.\n2. You are hanging around somebody you shouldn’t be hanging around with.\n\nHow to resolve this? Develop more of a thick skin and unapologetically get what you want out of life too. Also recognise that confrontation isn’t always a bad thing. You will not live forever.
5	I'm an ENFJ as well and yea I feel like that a lot. I tend to put my negative emotions like anger or annoyance aside in order to appear "correct" socially when dealing with someone. Especially with people I see everyday but are only acquaintances. I think it's because we want to be liked by everyone and we want people to judge us positively. We always want to make a good impression. \n\nTo be fair, only my true friends and my boyfriend (him even more) see my real me, like the nice and empathetic but moody and anxious bitch me ahah. And still, I always feel bad showing them this side of me and tend to apologise for being moody most of the time. I overthink social interactions where I felt I've been mean or socially bad to someone.\n\nAlso, I feel like I can adapt to everyone but it's not always the real me they're seeing, it's more like I'm trying to please them by being someone they would get along with. Needless to say this interaction never becomes friendship. \nI think I act like this cause I want everyone to feel themselves and accepted although paradoxically I am not being myself when doing this.\n\nIt's an interesting behaviour..
4	Totally can relate.  I don’t necessarily feel I hide part of myself to please others. It more like to protect myself and only have those worthy enough to share me with me lol if that makes sense 
3	Ditto. 
3	SAME!\n\nI'm very selective of those I want to be around with because I "feed" on their energy, meaning that I end up mirroring them sometimes if I end up hanging out with them too much. 😅 To the point that I once nearly lost myself because I tried to hard to be someone else and nearly became someone else. \n\nIt feels unfair though, because there are people who seem more genuine, people end up liking them more. ._. But, it's hard to be that sometimes because there's the vulnerability that comes with being open and genuine. \n\nSo lately, everytime I feel that way, I tell myself that "it's okay" and then try to not wear my mask so tightly. And so far, I found a few friends that I can be a bit more open with. 😊 So you have a point there
2	I can completely relate. Now as a young adult, I find my self “performing” less and letting people in a bit more. So far so good!
2	I hid my true self for a long time and it only leads to confusion and pain. It is so much more rewarding to live once you've realized that you don't need to hide your true self from the people that matter. Once you've become comfortable with who you truly are and embrace that person inside and out, your life gets so much more enjoyable. 
2	We all wear masks...metaphorically speaking.
1	YES
1	I'm an ENFJ type 8.. less likely to experience that. but really hope you'll overcome it pretty soon
1	Yes, I can relate to this in some ways.  It's complicated, but in some situations I've felt like I need to 'perform' up to my  reputation..but the more mature I get, the less concerned I am about this. It's an "ENFJ" growing older kinda thing, I think. Maybe it's me feeling more secure in my skin, but I don't feel pressure to impress - I just know I can if I act like who I am. Most of the time I'll be successful, but sometimes I might not be..and that's OK. \n\nWhen I was in my late teens, early 20s..I romanticized relationships - and after that first college girlfriend, it was a dose of reality that I couldn't get along with some people, and that I couldn't make it perfect.. 
1	I relate to this and find I censor myself around certain people because I’m not sure they’ll like me (I come across as very sweet and calm). Once I feel comfortable and trust them I’m more outgoing and funny and that catches people off guard sometimes, which then makes me self conscious, it’s an unfortunate cycle lol
1	you don't have to. you can be authentic. it depends on how you frame your authenticity. people might think you're a little weird. they're probably a little weird too. just be confident about it.\n\nif something about you turns out to be legitimately bothersome, then great, now you have something to work on. people will only think better of you for being better. 
41	Sometimes I wish I wasn’t ENFJ	I wish I could be a more independent and self-serving type sometimes to be honest.\n\nMy kindness is perceived as weakness, childish even by some, (also I don’t know if this is an ENFJ/HSP/etc thing but I also cry easily at almost everything even when I’m angry), and I’ve been hurt by many “friends” over the course of my life. I would help them with their issues and try to be the best friend I can for them and I would NEVER get the same treatment back and would even get abuse back. I now have PTSD about making new friends/romantic relationships/trusting people in general bc it has happened so many times with different people.\n\n(The good news is I have better friends now and have learned what I will and will not tolerate from people. Yet I’m still afraid a lot)\nIt sucks when your type is based around people and helping others and they just keep hurting you and letting you down.\n\nSometimes I just hate being such a “feely” type. I feel like I never get taken seriously and thus get taken advantage of.\n\n\n\nTo be able to just turn my feelings off and the intensity...\n\nTo not have to rely on others, their quality time, their reassurance, etc so much...\n\nTo just be more independent and not feel so alone all the time...\n\nIt would be amazing.\n\n\n\nI HAVE no skin. Couldn’t grow one if I tried.\nWhat’s wrong with me? I feel like this is more than just being an ENFJ thing but idk. Maybe someone can help me?\n\n\nDoes this resonate with anyone?\n(I love this sub, everyone seems really nice and understanding. Like a home. Just thought I’d say)
13	I completely understand what you're saying and have definitely had all of these thoughts before. I wish I was more introverted too and could just be happy by myself. The reassurance thing is so silly, since we tend to get it all the time but want it again and again. I really don't perceive anything to be "wrong" with you, it's just part of the weakness that comes with being an ENFJ. You're just aware and honest with yourself.\n\nAgain, I empathize will all of what you are describing. I'm 23 years old right now and I would say things have been getting a little but easier every year, but falling back into loneliness occasionally is still common. Also the feeling that none of my closest friends do what I would do from them always lingers. Can't fully trust anyone in this world except yourself unfortunately.\n\nPersonally I find that staying active helps a lot with these things: working out, going to school, quality time with friends/family, etc.. The more time I have alone to think the more I get into the type of thought patterns you're describing. \n\nEvery personality type is gonna have some flaws and insecurities, frankly I'm pretty happy with the trade off that comes with being an ENFJ. Keep reminding yourself of your strengths and try to push yourself to be content alone from time to time.\n\nPeace and love
7	I definitely understand what you are saying. I feel like people may sometimes consider me a pushover, or want to take advantage of me simply because I want other people to have what they want. I love helping people, and I want to help them - but sometimes it does take a toll on me.I have a desire to be emotionally independent, but the need for reassurance from others gets in the way sometimes. \n\nMy biggest thing is that I need to be true to myself and others It's so easy, almost natural, to just go along with what everyone else wants and thinks. I find myself nodding along in conversation to people whether it's politics, religion, etc., when in reality I could not disagree with what they are saying more. I just want to hear people out and know that they are heard. I believe it's good to be civil, but I go the extra mile by agreeing with everyone around me just so I don't start a conflict of some sort. I hate confrontation, and I know it's something else I need to work on. I stretch myself thin sometimes, and regret it. I need to learn how to tell people how I truly feel.\n\nI apologize for the ramblings of a twenty-one year old just trying to find his place in the world. But always know that there are people in your corner who are going through very similar trials that you are. Maybe we can help each other along the way.
4	I feek you man, I recently really struggled with all of this, say for 10 months or so. Things git better towards the end of last year. Yes you will grow a thicker skin. I also hated myself for being so emotional, but we shouldn't fight it. This is just how we are,  allow yourself to feel. I decided I'm nit letting anyone tell me shit, if you don't like me then piss off. Worked out fantastic!\n\nNow, I have a girlfriend who understands and loves me for me, I have one less friend, and this made a massive positive impact in my life. Here is why : you know that thing about helping others and all that we do? So I used to do everything for this guy like help him register for University, help him with his assignments, do research for shit he didn't know or understand, I was basically his fucking mother, so one day I said I'm done. We grew apart after, best decision I've ever made. I could focus on myself. And I did, and now life is great.\n\nPoint is, you'll be alright. I think it just take a bit of practice to understand yourself as an ENFJ and hoe to handle it.\n\nCHEERS BROOOO
3	I resonate with your post so much.\n\nI give my all when I love someone. Growing up, I gave all my love and attention to my friends, but not everyone appreciated it. I was called “too intense”. It was quite hurtful, knowing that you’re giving your all but people are turned off by it. It made me build a wall around myself, and I gradually began to fear making friends, as it only resulted in pain and hurt for me.\n\nHowever, things have changed in the last few years. Friends who appreciate me have stuck around. I’ve even gained many friends who appreciate my intensity, my authenticity, my sincerity. I realised that my willingness to be vulnerable and to demonstrate affection - is my strength, as it helps me make meaningful connections and form deep friendships with people. Even older people. Sisters of friends. Colleagues.\n\nLove yourself and don’t be afraid to be YOU. You’ll find people who love you for being you.\n\nOf course, there are still times when I wish I were not an ENFJ. When feelings of despair and acute sadness well up, I struggle to regulate my emotions and I’m completely consumed by these feelings. It feels quite painful, physically so. There were times when I wished I were apathetic, as it could save me so much heartache...
4	Omg, you ENFJs are so special. I wish I knew someone who was ENFJ who could always be there for me and make me feel not alone.
3	Keep doing you. Long term happiness comes from service to others (but not at the expense of yourself).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLoving yourself is extremely important in growing and honestly right now all the doubts come from how you feel you should be due tosocial constructs and the disappointment you feel from people you feel you can depend on.  Just take note that when you help someone, you can't really expect things in return from them. Because you should feel good that you did the right thing, not really expecting stuff in return. Otherwise everything you do is transactional, and not as sincere.  ENFJs do not need to rely on others, we help those in need and the help we provide is enough internal validation we require to press on.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a full on ENFJ and like throughout life, a lot of things I did, did not come to fruition until years later.  I've not heard thank yous until maybe several years after I provided the help people needed at the time.  Sometimes, people don't know hoe much of an impact you put until soooo much later.  Thus, you never really know how much you do until so much later.  There's nothing wrong with you as aperson.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter all it takes time to know what you want and need out of life.  Currently, you just need to do what you feel is right, and do not put expectations behind it.  I felt the same way you did during my early 20s, and once I reached my late 20s, i heard back from people I dont talk to anymore.  It just feels good to do the right thing and knowing internally, you tried your best to help others. Peeps don't really see the good u do until late in life sometimes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: do things you want to do to be nice without expectations.  IF you like doing what you're doing, continue doing it.  If you expect things to come in return for the deeds you do, it's not as insincere and puts you in reliance of external validation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe point of being who you are is to accept it and let it happen.  Suppressing emotions and feelings, never come out to anything positive.  Feelign is what makes us human and ENFJs do a lot to make good in this world. Rock it, dont hate it.
3	I can really relate to this, as a Type 2 ENFP. I find we have a lot of the same struggles. Oddly enough, someone once wrote a story about an ENFJ friend called "no skin" and I couldn't help thinking about it when reading your post. I think having an anxious attachment style can also make this more difficult, though I don't know if that's the case with you. Happy to chat more if you like, so feel free to send me a PM on here! Hugs!
3	Hi, ENFP here. I totally get it because of the nature of our types.\n\nBoth ENFP and ENFJs are feely, people oriented types. My partner is an ENFJ and we’re scarily similar with how our brains work.\n\nRecently I’ve been having a whole identity crisis, not knowing who I am and feeling sharper and harder — not the bubbly ENFP I usually feel like. When I (not legit) psychoanalyze myself, I see that I have a history in the past 2 years that have forced me to not want to deal with BS anymore. It’s kind of difficult to explain, but I got pushed around a lot in the past 2 years and my body is only feeling it now. It’s kind of scary.\n\nPart of me is glad. The other part of me wishes I was soft as water as I once was. I tell myself that a lot — to stay as soft as water. My partner is one of the warmest and softest people I know, if not the most warm and soft, and I adore her for it. She reminds me of my roots.\n\nIt’s important here to understand that:\n1) your kindness is NOT weakness.\n2) just because you’re an ENFJ doesn’t mean you can’t build into the habit of assertion and standing up for yourself.\n3) your strengths are incredible. My ENFJ reminds me of the good in the world.\n\nIf you want to change, you can, you know. I don’t think you can change your core, but you can practice your assertion in tiny ways and build up. Maybe practice saying no every so often when you don’t want to go out to that party. Take the guilt of doing something for yourself over the resent of giving in to someone else’s wants.\n\nBut just know that your strength to be soft and to be feely and empathetic and kind is something that this world needs. There are way too many cold and sharp people and I’m trying to find the middle line where I can be soft and kind and warm, but never let anyone think that my kindness is weakness.\n\nPM me if you need anything, sending love and warmth to you.
3	I resonate with this so much it’s not even funny. Like, every word you said clicks with me. I’m always there for people when they need someone and I really wish that didn’t get exploited, or that someone would be there for me on the occasions I need them. I don’t even feel that way that much compared to how much I help others, but damn would it be nice if someone helped when I DID feel it
2	Yes, yes and yes.
2	Kenny from Half Baked is definitely an ENFJ, lol\n\nHope things get better for you, man\n\nhttps://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/628381ac-522e-41ed-bb83-ebb45450bd20
1	I can only imagine how challenging it has been. I am an ENFJ too, but I know we all have different experiences. I can relate to people mistaking your kindness for weakness, but one of my friends told me that it's other people's loss if they treat you badly. I have had to learn to not take things personally and I thought it was impossible, because I can feel everything. I'm not perfect at it by any means, but I realized that generally people are just projecting their own emotions or thoughts on me and it has nothing to do with me. I cannot help that I'm sensitive, but I do not have to allow other's emotions to effect me negatively. There is nothing wrong with you. It took me a while to finally accept that, and I am sure you will see that within yourself too! :) ENFJs make-up about 3% of the general population...we are special and are greatly needed. Keep your head-up!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I meditate twice a day and practice yoga and work-out weekly. It really helps as well to have more peace. :)
1	(INFP) I would like some advice: My sister is ENFJ and sometimes I feel like I come off as selfish to her and make her upset just with random stuff I say. Suggestions for making her feel loved and appreciated?	We are best friends, but sometimes I think I come off as so childish and selfish to her, and it seems to genuinely hurt her. Obviously, the last thing I want to do is hurt my sister, so I'd like some advice on how to talk to her using her language. 
2	I think my sister is the same personality type as you, and I am an ENFJ. We  love each other and are great friends but can butt heads in a dramatic way. \n\nI think she can act selfish and demanding and I don't think she sees my efforts towards being kind. I am sure I am misunderstanding her in many ways too, I know it's not one sided. But from ENFJ point of view, what aways really makes me feel nice is when she offers to help me, is patient, and is more giving than bossy. I feel I try to take care of her without asking so when she does it for me without asking, I feel looked out for. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am not sure if that sounds like your dynamic at all, but I hope that helps!
2	Oh boy. I'm an XNFP and my older sister is an ENFX. It's really hard to avoid the Fe/Fi clash :( \n\nI love her so much and I'd like to make amends with her, however she is in a funk. She is very cynical and depressed. Any advice on how to bring a cynical ENFJ out of the dark and back in to their calm, happy, relaxed state. As an XNFP, it's difficult to agree with her negative comments and she wishes I was less PC "politically correct". 
4	ENFJ (f) seeking help with her INTJ man! (x-post from /r/INTJ)	Hello all! X-posting this from /r/intj, but curious to hear the (ENFJ) flipside of the coin!\n\nHi all, apologies in advance for the long post.\n\nI (ENFJ, f) have been dating an INTJ (m) for about 4 months now. We are both in our late 20s. It’s been an interesting experience so far, and would like to gather your opinions on our situation.\n\n*Pros:*\n\n* **I love how intellectual he is** (this is a given, of course). He thinks about many esoteric things that I never consider, which is refreshing; and in turns makes me feel motivated to learn more/read more and discuss these things. (This can sometimes be a con because he is quite frequently in his head and it’s hard to draw him out and come back to reality sometimes). \n\n* **His independence, drive, and that he’s headstrong.** He is so steadfast in his vision that his work ethic is very admirable – he will stop at nothing to get something done, or fulfill his goals. I never have to worry about him not being able to take care of himself, and in turn, makes me want to be there for him/support/spoil him even more. \n\n* **His emotional side.** Oh my gosh, it makes me so squishy inside. 90% of the time he’s stoic, absurd, structured, analytical; but when we are alone and when he sometimes reveals his deep emotions to me, it is intoxicating. I know it doesn’t come natural to him, so I treasure outward expression of his feelings, and try to create an environment that is welcoming and nurturing for these intimate thoughts/feelings. \n\n* **He’s steadfast and reliable.** \n\n* **We communicate well together** – any disagreements are level-headed, mature, goal-oriented and never escalate out of hand. \n\n* **When he wants to be, he can be so charming, thoughtful, and hilarious.** Again, intoxicating. The flipside to this: when he is not in the mood (like 70% of the time), he is icy and disengaged, and I feel a million miles away from him. \n\n\n*Challenges:*\n\n* **Differences in lifestyles.** I work hard and play hard. He works hard and works hard, and plays (somewhat, and only his own terms). I’m in a pretty solid spot in my life – I am very independent, my circle of friends are loving, supportive, I have lots of interests/hobbies, have a strong joie de vivre and try to live life to the fullest where possible. He works works works (which is fine), but I want a partner who I can fully bring into my world, show me his, and have amazing adventures and experience all life has to offer together. He says he’s adventurous, but I have yet to see his side of him – all I’ve seen so far is that he’s often reluctant to get out of his comfort zone, which is kind of a turn off. It makes me feel like I need to meet him more where he is, instead meeting somewhere in the middle.\n\n* **Imbalance of effort:** I feel like I’ve tried to really make an effort to integrate myself into his life, be a positive presence and be warm and loving with his friends. It’s not outside of the realm of who I am to be/do these things, but I make extra effort because these people are very close to him, and I don’t feel like he is the same with people in my life. As a result, his friends quite like me… and none of my friends like him. I see the person who I am dating as an extension of myself (and my choices), so the idea of people who are very dear to me being tepid about him is not an insignificant issue. To clarify: I know the real charm of INTJs come from getting to know who they are and not based on superficial interactions, but we are both in our late 20s and I shouldn’t feel the need to “explain” his inadvertent asocial behaviour to my friends. I know he does not want to come off this way but I don’t think he is socially aware enough to understand how he presents sometimes. \n\n* **Imbalance with regard to the emotional aspects of our relationship.** For me to feel intimate with someone, I need some mutual expression of vulnerability/emotions. I am demonstrative, actively affectionate, vocal, and make an effort to be vulnerable in front of him to help foster a space where he can be that way with me, too. Surprise, as an INTJ, he’s not great at that, and often acts in a way I perceive as aloof/cold like 75% of the time (but the rare occasion when he does act verbally affectionate, I am over the moon). I have a hard time making out if it’s because he’s tepid towards me or because he truly is that stoic. It results in self-doubt about what he thinks about me/us; which can sometimes lead to me being insecure and emotional. I try very hard not to let that affect me because I abhor the idea of being perceived as needy, but bottling my emotions is not a workable solution in the long-term either. Second example: he doesn’t put any sort of label on our “relationship”. He doesn’t refer to me as his girlfriend, or even acknowledges that we’re in a relationship. I respect him enough not to push the issue, but it hurts a bit. All these things make me feel uncared for. \n\n* As a result, I feel like there has been some **stagnation** in our relationship. The way I see it: I would never want to push someone to emote or express something they are not feeling. So to me, if he is not expressing that he wants to be more serious with me, then he is not feeling it. (I understand this may not be the case, and he may actually feel something deeply for me, but how the fuck am I supposed to know if he doesn’t express it? And I will spare the awkwardness for both of us and not try to force it out of him.)\n\n* **The clincher:** he is actively applying to grad school abroad, and is uncertain if he wants to return if he goes. He started this process before we met, so I don’t hold that against him; and I would never stand in the way of his dreams. In fact, I have been very encouraging of him pursuing grad school. But when we first started dating, I asked him what he was looking for, and he said a serious relationship. When I asked him how he reconciled that idea with going away indefinitely to grad school, he said “I don’t reconcile them, they just both exist together”. To me, this speaks volumes: \n\n\n1. He is not emotionally mature or experienced enough in relationships to really understand the sacrifice that would be involved in being in a LDR. I’ve had my fair share of relationships and have done LDR twice. I have basically 0 interest in doing it again, which I have expressed to him. \n\n2. That he is a bit selfish. He wants his to have his cake and eat it too: he wants to pursue his dreams AND have a serious relationship, wherein he would find a partner that is willing support his dreams with little consideration as to what she would want or what she would need to sacrifice to make it work. \n\n\n* This is holding me back from fully investing into us as a means of self-preservation.  \n\n**TL;DR:** I like him, but I feel like I put in way more effort than he does into trying to make this work. In all fairness, I know he’s kind of trying (we have talked about some of these issues and he's making incremental improvements). It’s a ton of work and sometimes exhausting dating him, trying to constantly read his mood, analyze his thoughts and act accordingly. As a result, I sometimes feel like my needs aren’t being met, and I’m not sure if it’s all worth it. \n\n\n**So, my dear ENFJ friends: your thoughts?** Shall I keep seeing how this unfolds or back away before I burn out? Any insight is welcome. Thank you for taking the time to read :) 
2	Learn about socionics (Russian MBTI) the ILI type (INTp is the name in Socionics but it corresponds to INTJ in MBTI) and learn about your own type.\n\n------\n\nOne thing that learning about socionics is that all humans have 8 functions, 4 of them are "valued" and 4 of them are "subdued / in shadow" where we prefer the opposite introversion / extroversion energy of the subdued information element^(what Jung calls a function) (which is its corresponding valued information element)\n\nSo both an ENFJ and an ILI prefer Ni over Ne with Ni being valued and Ne being subdued.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow here is a followup to those two previous paragraphs.  We also have 4 functions we are "strong in" and 4 functions we are "weak in" and 2 of the functions we are strong in are Valued and 2 of them are Subdued.\n\nThus an ENFJ is strong in Ni and Ne^(subdued) but is also strong in Fe and Fi^(subdued)\n\nLikewise an ILI is strong in Ni and Ne^(subdued) but is also strong in Te and Ti^(subdued)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo the stuff I explained is quite easy to grasp and here is the part that is still easy to grasp but the OHHH and I  understand why it is a big deal will not happen until you understand the system.\n\nSo in Socionics...\n\nWith our 4 weak functions, 2 of the weak functions we will always appreciate help with that is useful help that actually makes us better at them in the moment.  But 2 of those weak functions, the ones that are Subdued / Unvalued we only get better at them via experience and we intellectually understand their purpose, but you can't really do a transfer of values from one person to another.  You can't make them like and appreciate this function as much as you do, it just does not work that way.\n\nWorse if you start criticizing them on the use of that function, even the most gentle and loving criticism and they are not invested **in the moment** with working on the function, it will backfire on you.  These functions improve via experience.\n\nWith an ILI these 2 functions they are weak at and are in shadow / subdued / unvalued are Fe and Si.\n\nAnd with an ENFJ these 2 functions they are weak at and are in shadow / subdued / unvalued are Si and Te.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nConservesly an ILI will appreciate help with Se and Fi and tips on how to improve this information element / function.\n\nAnd an ENFJ will appreciate help with Ti and Se and tips on how to improve this information element.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn addition the order of what is more sensitive to an ILI with Fe and Si matters.  Fe stuff will really stress out an ILI and you can't transfer your experience and wisdom of Fe tasks onto an ILI, they have to learn this via experience.  You can transfer your praise, but you can't transfer your experience, or proactive criticism and get a good result.  With 14 other MBTI types you can give helpful Fe advice but on an ILI and 1 other type this will backfire on you.\n\nThe why this occurs with the previous paragraph you will learn and understand once you know more about Socionics, I can't really explain it without being cryptic till you learn the basics of this variant MBTI.  But learning about this variant MBTI will help you understand both what is triggering for you, and also will help you understand what is triggering for your partner.\n\nGood Luck \^_\^
2	This is so crazy to read because I'm also an ENFJ dating an INTJ and I understand exactly what you're going through. We met about a year and a half ago over the summer, he had an internship in my area and was about to finish his final year of college. When I found out he was only going to be in my area for a few weeks, I was hesitant to go into long distance, especially because of how different we are and the fact that I struggled to tell if he actually would put in the effort or not. The way you explained your boyfriend saying that he just sees grad school and your relationship existing together is exactly how my boyfriend went about the situation. Like it wasn't a big deal. To my surprise, he actually did quite well in the long distance. He was committed enough to the relationship to trade drives with me and make our visits special. \n\nI understand the way INTJs come off when it comes to dating, but like you said, it's about who they are when you get to know them. Sometimes it's worth sticking through the cynicism and social awkwardness and all the other confusing parts for those times he really makes you feel great. \n\nJust a final note that i really do understand everything you've written, pros and cons. My boyfriend is exactly this way and it sometimes feels difficult to work on the relationship with someone that comes off so detached emotionally, but in my experience, INTJs care very deeply and very quietly. \n\nMy advice would be to be more verbal with him. I understand being nervous to make him uncomfortable by pushing him into unwanted conversations, but that's the only way I've made progress. And INTJs can be up to facing challenges if it's for someone they really care about. Tell him what you're scared of and what you need to feel safe in the relationship. If he doesn't work on it don't break your back over it. But remember that the ball is in both courts if you're long distance and that communication is key, so he needs to get used to opening up a little more. Hope that was helpful and I loved reading your post and felt very understood.
1	maybe he is so focused on his work goals that he feels like taking time for his adventurous side would hold him back or distract him\n\nlucky for him, you have a rich world to expose him to if that's what you want. sounds like he needs to get out of his head and devlop his Ne more for sure.
1	I am also an ENFJ female (21 yo) dating an INTJ male (26 yo). We've been together for 2 years and a half and we are really fusional, there's such a level of trust and love it's crazy. We know we want to spend the rest of our lives together because we're friends and lovers, we know we can count on each other. \nHowever, it's not always been easy and we had to improve our communication in order to make it work. He used to be extremely cold and closed at the start of the relationship and now he tells me EVERYTHING, even the smallest things and he is very honest with me. \n\nI can relate to you saying that you are in a happy moment in your life with your social life and everything. That's completely me, my friends are my second family and they're are extremely important to me. As an ENFJ, I give a lot of myself to everyone who deserves it. So my INTJ boyfriend was very bitter about this because he has his comfort zone where he works a lot to achieve great success but struggle with his social life as he doesn't have many real friends. He was unsecured and jealous about me paying attention to my friends (even though I made a lot of compromises to not go out with my friends and reassure him about loyalty amongst other things, in brief I take great care of him maybe too much sometimes). I had to explain many times to my friends why my boyfriend doesn't like me being out and why he still hasn't made an effort to meet them. My friends understand but he needs to make an effort. After many discussions, he is working on himself to be more social, he is asking advice from me and I am encouragement to do more, without me, with his own circle. You need to take baby steps with an INTJ otherwise they won't even consider making an effort. But you need to challenge him about his behaviour as well. So yea INTJ have their comfort zone and it's to us ENFJ to get them out of it. They are adventurous trust me but they will rarely get themselves out without a bit of help. \n\nFor the vulnerability part, I was annoyed with this when we started dating. I clearly asked him why he isn't more vulnerable. He explained to me that he saw vulnerability as a weakness and to me, as a pure ENFJ, it shocked me that someone could think that about vulnerability in a relationship. I taught him to let himself go and share freely how he feels. It took him around 6 months of relationship to finally open up about his past, his insecurities, his love for me etc. I feel like that helped the relationship progress in so many ways. You need to let him learn to trust you and he will eventually be vulnerable with you and open up completely.\nIt takes time and patience to be in a relationship with an INTJ, trust me, it's not for everyone. But it is all worth it in the end.\n\nIt's so funny that you're talking about him going abroad. When I met my boyfriend, he was planning to go to Australia for his third year of university. He applied to it before we met as well. I remember that he didn't go in the end because he took too much time to apply for it (strange for an INTJ you'll tell me, I think he was really working out if he should stay or go because of me). An INTJ is really career focused and it's gonna fuck his mind up to have to even think about choosing between a real relationship and his career success. So yes, as a logical thinker, he's gonna try to make both work and be a bit in denial and then realises he has to make a decision. I think your INTJ is just in a period of denial because he is happy with you and doesn't want to have to think about decisions yet, and then he will have to think it through properly. I don't think he's being immature, I think he's just trying to make it work but INTJ are very awkward with emotional decisions so your INTJ doesn't get the entire issues with a LDR yet. \n\nSo yes, dating an INTJ is EXHAUSTING I'm not gonna lie ahah. It's a lot of work but it's not gonna stay a one-way effort. INTJ will make efforts but they sometimes need a kick in the ass in order to wake up and realise that we, ENFJs, are not gonna be there forever if it stays this way. On your side, it's you to decide if you're gonna be patient or not. Your needs will eventually be met but it takes a lot of patience. \nIt's interesting to see all the similarities between your relationship and mine. I wish you good luck with your relationship, hope it will work out in the end!

5	Jet's MBTI - Cast Podcast	Hey Reddit, my name is jetplane48 (ESTP 7w8 sx/sp) and I am starting up a podcast in relation to MBTI. Fundamentally, the goal of the podcast is to educate the viewers of several Typology systems through a series of one-on-one's with others who are interested in the same topics. I have been conducting interviews for many years (MBTI related) and this is just an extension of that, however, I want to discuss topics that the audience wants me to cover. Naturally, I'll come up with my own material but I would love to explore topics that others have in mind. I am busy with school for the next few months but when I finish, the goal is to eventually be more consistent with these podcast uploads if this turns out to be popular enough. I'm very excited to get this started, and let's see some questions!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg)\n\n&#x200B;
48	"ᵂʰᵃᵗ ʰᵃᵛᵉ ʸᵒᵘ ᵈᵒⁿᵉˀ"	
12	From what I've seen, If you made an enfj angry you probably did a lot of very bad things and now you better watch out. 
10	Takes a ton to get me pissed. So it’s usually well deserved and about time, when I actually do lose my temper. 
19	As an INFP dating an ENFJ, this is way too real.  I love you guys, but you can be a bit hot headed.
3	Lmao 
1	ENFJ's have Ti, not Te.
29	Childhood Stories of ENFJs	Sometimes when I think back to my childhood I recall moments, stories and memories that were very ENFJ. I thought we could make this into quite the Reddit post if we all share one.\n\n*I was about 9 or 10 years old as I remember, and I had gone to class with a cold, because I always believed if I pretended I was well or that if I hoped enough then I would be well sooner. Anyways, I had a cold. I sneezed multiple times in a row and my teacher said, “Bless you! Bless you! Bless you! You just want all the blessings!”\nAnd I felt bad. I didn't want all the blessings. I wanted everyone to have some. I held in the rest of my sneezes.*\n\n
19	In first grade I had this math workbook, and the teacher tore a page out to let me work on it at home. Well I started crying and no one could figure out why. They sent me to the guidance counselor, where I showed him the page and told him that now it would be sad because it wasn’t with its other friends in the workbook. He assured me that it was in a better place or something, but man did I get upset over that piece of paper’s social life.
6	I got involved into a fight with my mother when she disapproved of my sister's choice and it hurt the family dynamic. Everyone told me in no uncertain terms to mind my own. I learned at a young age to let people handle their own mess if they don't ask for my help!\n\nMy other sister and I also noticed that my mother was less dismissive and/or disappointed in her when she saw her report card before mine (I had an easier time academically). So we always made sure to show hers first, wait a bit, then show mine.\n\nEdit: Spelling
3	I would pretend I ate all the meat product leftovers so that I could feed them to stary cats waiting outside everynight, I still do that but without the pretending
3	My little classmates were toying with a large shrub, bending and breaking its branches off. I was devastated. Why would they want to hurt it? It had done nothing wrong, and was a lovely place to sit under, with its fresh spring leaves and white blossoms. \n\nI sat under the bush and hugged my knees and cried at the injustice of it all. Eventually, my classmates went back inside at the end-of-recess bell and my teacher had to come looking for me. I imagine she was relieved and perplexed to find me under the bush, still sniffling. \n\nI also cried when my snowmen melted. \n\nI cried very recently when a big tree was chopped down on our block for no reason--just because some assholes razed the house it lived in front of and probably didn't want it blocking their hideous new McMansion. I'm 32.
3	Haha! That’s brilliant. Sneezes all around.
3	I just remember throughout my life I was always like a therapist for all of my friends. Even as a young kid all my friends would come to me for encouragement and advice.\nThey would just unload everything on me and I was always there for them. Just sitting there, patting them on the back and letting them all just talk it out so they could feel better.\n\nIt always brought me great joy too, to feel so needed.
2	I remember being on summer holidays with my family. There was a playground at the bottom of the block of flats we were staying at, and I was allowed to go by myself (I was 10) because my parents could watch on me from there. I was playing and then I thought I will go and get some sweets for my little brother who was 6 and couldn't play without my parents there. I went into a little adventure around the small town with my pocket money and got some sweets for my brother and an ice cream for me for the way back. When I came back my mother hugged me, she was so worried because she couldn't see me at the playground anymore. I stood there not very understanding what was going on and I looked at my brother and said "I've got some sweets for you" ahah
25	Does anyone else can’t function if their room/car isn’t organized?	
10	Yes lol, it doesn’t have to be perfect but I don’t like clutter and big messes.
7	Yes. I’m very particular about everything having its specific place. If I’m not busy (weekends, vacations, etc.), things tend to get messy. But once I start getting busy again with work, school, etc., everything stays cleaned and organized. \n\nIf I don’t have my car, room, closest, etc. cleaned and organized when I’m busy, I get really frazzled and frustrated. I’m super OCD (self diagnosed) about certain things (my clothes being set out for the next day, my keys and wallet in the specific spot in my drawer, etc.) and structured. I even do best on a super strict schedule because of that. I can’t work a sporadic schedule. 
4	Yes, but WAY more so about my car than my room lol.
3	Yes, but I live with a very messy INFP. Learning to deal with it lol! 
3	Nope. Things tend to get organised over time more by accident (ie area for my dirty clothes, my makeup will be together near a mirror and good light, my jewellery somewhere on a shelf together, my books etc). My room may look messy but it's organised to me. I like being able to see everything. My room doesn't stay minimalist clean for long...\n\nI don't have a car but would only keep it clean because I don't want to make others uncomfortable or have them judge me.
1	Yes. Being unable to find my things efficiently is emotionally crippling, not to mention highly impractical. -ENFJ
10	What’s Up Fam!	You guys are literally my fav type but so hard to find 😶\n\nThere’s a group chat on reddit (if you’re not already apart of it) just for ENFJ’s. I know you guys tend to be on the social side so this might be a good way to connect with others. \n\nI think for the time being, most of the people on the chat are other personality types, but that’s not surprising :p \n\nIf you’d rather not be in the group chat, we can chat individually! I’m really just looking for an ENFJ penpal (: anyone and everyone is welcome to comment xx
5	How do you feel listened to? Who makes you feel listened to?	
4	It's a hard question.\n\nI feel listened to when what I say is picked up. In the sense that, it will come back to the conversation, or someone will ask questions. It tells me that what I say has value, even if we are not in agreement. If I get interrupted or no one responds (or someone barely does) I don't feel listened to.\n\nI think my best friend is possibly the only one who makes me feel listened to. I may have just learned what to say, and not to, because we've known each other for over 10 years.\n\nI've learned to accept the pinch of sadness when I feel that my interests have no importance to the people I'm talking to. I just go on and talk about what drives them instead.
4	I feel that being "listened to" is about not only the speaking aspect but the action aspect. For me, I feel "listened to" when I mentioned something in brief awhile ago and someone brings it up again in conversation at random. It makes me feel like someone stored that random tidbit of information on their mental notepad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also think being listened to is about the other party's attentiveness. For example, I might not say that I don't like it when the napkins are folded into squares, but it's not a big irritant. I would feel "listened to" if someone who was helping me set up the table remembered that little thing without me having to note it. 
1	I feel most listened to when someone else shares similar experiences or thoughts. I don’t mean making an conversation all about them, but like, if I vent and they briefly explain a similar situation they’ve been through, I just think, “man, they understand.” And knowing that makes me feel not only less alone in my struggle, but also more confident in that someone’s paid attention to my thoughts. People who are good at relating without changing the subject 100% to them - the perfect balance - make me feel listened to.
4	What is your Enneagram type?	I've recently taken an Enneagram test and I'm typed as a 2w3. I was wondering what your Enneagram types are and how they correlate to you being an ENFJ.
4	3w2.
4	3w2
3	3w2 or 3w1
3	I took the test and got 2w3 too. I’ll admit though I haven’t looked too much into Enneagram 
3	3w2
2	2w3!!
2	8w9 but test isnt that reliable. If i were to consider test then i would've been "2w3" as well
2	I’m a Type 6. Still haven’t nailed down the wing though.
2	I'm a type 9w3 which i dont get AT ALL 😂😂😂
1	I’m 2w1. I don’t know much about enneagram (still learning) but I’ve heard type two is seeking connections, deep relationships with others, etc,\n\nand\n\nbeing type one has a lot of to with striving for perfection, consistent self-improvement blah blah blah blah\n\nAll which seems to ME definitely screams ENFJ or at least this ENFJ anyways.\n\nAny websites/links to learn more about Enneagram would also be appreciated\n\n: )
2	Cant find any validation	Hey guys i just re discovered the mbti test and the result i got isnt right for me. i got enfp but i didnt really fit so i did a more complex test and i got enfj. I feel more related to enfj but dont have all the traits so could you guys help me out discovering who really am 
2	read up on cognative functions. tests aren't always accurate
1	Idk if this will help but the website PersonalityMax.com used to cost a ton of money (it covered MBTI as well as other things)\nbut for some reason now it’s free.\n\nIf you want to take just the MBTI part of the test you got to uncheck every box except the first one.\n\nBut, like the other poster mentioned, your best bet to know for sure is studying the cognitive functions in-depth.
38	Deconstructing NFs	
6	What?
3	Wth 
3	now this is some surreal shit, had to check which sub I was in. 10/10
2	The heck?
1	Explain please
40	I don't know if it's an ENFJ thing or...	When I'm reading a book, watching a movie or tv show, or watching a video online, I start to put myself in these people's situations and it makes me physically cringe. For example, if I'm watching a movie and something embarrassing is happening to the main character, I too easily see myself in that predicament and cannot help but feel horrible for them, even if they are fictional.
24	That's called empathy lol
4	A lot of times I can’t even finish the movie/show because it makes me too anxious  
5	Ahahahaahha that's funny but I'm exactly the same and I think I'm ENFJ. I end up being too emotional and I really need to suppress them if I'm around people but If I'm alone....  Probably this is why I like dramas so much :D\n\nI have to suppress my emotions because I think its not very masculine and I end up too much involved in the character and it's just too painful.\n\nI think ENFJ's are best "chameleons" and can really put themselves in other's shoes.
3	Totally relatable. I recently just got into Hamilton, the musical, and when I listened to “Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story” I bawled so hard, and when I thought about putting myself in Eliza’s shoes, living for another 50 years without the person you love, I cried even harder. lol such a crybaby (x
2	This is literally me too. Especially with reading books. I get so over involved and feel what they feel. It took me three read throughs of Catcher in the Rye before I could enjoy the book and stopped feeling like shit because Holden sucks so much 
3	Second hand embarrassment... I often have to pause shows I'm watching when I'm starting to feel more than the characters themselves.\n\nI don't do it as much when I have people around, but when I'm alone it always happens!\n\nI just thought I was weird hahaha!
1	At least you realize it. Some ENFJs that I know don't and end up believing being someone they are not. 
1	I can’t watch movies. I cannot separate my feelings from the ones displayed on the screen. It’s a roller coaster
7	ENFJ male anime protagonists/important characters?	I've been pouring over anime typings recently, and I've noticed how rare male enfjs are in anime. Fair enough, considering our portion of the real life general population is quite small, and we tend to be almost "forgettable" by the main populace. Are there any important characters that you guys can remember? I'll start a list\n\nAsuna - SAO (MBTI Database)\n\nSanji - One Piece (MBTI Database)\n\nMinato - Naruto (MBTI Database)\n\nKaori - Your Lie in April (MBTI Database) ( this shows the fucking best. )\n\nRobin - Teen Titans ("Dick Grayson" (MBTI Database)) \n\nMaes Hughes - Fullmetal Alchemist (MBTI Database)\n\nYuzuru - Angel Beats (MBTI Database) (Also great example and show. I recommend)\n\nWhat are some that you guys have seen. Doesn't have to just be male.\n
3	Glad you brought this topic up because I’ve always had the same question haha. \n\nFor me, I think of \n\n- Sinbad (Magi)\n- Dino (Katekyo Hitman Reborn)\n- Leorio (Hunter x Hunter)\n- Ace (One Piece)\n- Jushiro Ukitake (Bleach)\n- Manato (Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash)\n- Dazai? (Bungou Stray Dogs)
2	I dont watch much anime but I agree with Otonashi from angel beats \n\nHow about Kyousuke from Little Busters?
1	Starfire comes off more ExFJ. I know people will say she’s ENFP because only ENFPs can be quirky, but she literally leads off Fe imo.\n\nRobin comes off as ENTP, I know he’s a leader, but he actually rarely even takes other people’s feelings into consideration often. From what I remember, he only does this when necessary and it pays off well. 
9	Tinder mess!	I \[27F\] ENFJ met my so called bf \[29M\] ISFJ three weeks ago on Tinder, and we decided to date exclusively -his idea!\n\nWe both deleted Tinder app and decided to try to make things between us work!\n\nYesterday we were watching a video on his phone, and Tinder notifications popped up, he lied and said it is the phone problem and he does not know why the App still there, I asked him immediately to open the f\*\*\*ing app, was 22:00, and found a conversation that started 21:00 while he was on my bed after a great movie night out, he was sending 'hi' everywhere to random girls!\n\nI felt stupid to be in that situation! I felt hurt and I feel shit now! if someone could cry until die; I would be writing this from the grave!\n\nWhat to do?\n\n\*\*TL;DR;\*\* :\n\nDo you think if I continue with him he will do it again? or it is just 'mistake' as he said frankly!\n\nDo you think once a 'Tinder' user you would not quit and settle ? cause you know 'the sea is full of fish'!
31	I’d walk. ENFJ freeze out.
12	Yeah, if y’all agreed to be exclusive cut him out.  Especially if you only wasted 3 weeks.  Don’t trick yourself into wasting more. 
9	What an asshole
8	I don't like tinder cus the peeps i find are there are usually trash like this.  Don't stick with him, dump is ass.  If he lied to you once like this and is cheating, he'll do again.  Cheaters always cheat.\n\nYou deserve better.  I'm also 28F enfj.  I would not put up with his crap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf he feels bad, it's cus he feels bad that he got caught, not that he sincerely feels bad for doing you wrong
5	That really sucks, OP. You have every reason to feel hurt. \n\nYour first question -- yes, I think he'll do it again. He'll just get better at hiding it. Keeping the app on his phone could be "just a mistake"; messaging several girls is not. That was intentional.\n\nYour second question -- my wife (ENFJ) and I (INTP) met on Tinder. We both quit Tinder permanently after 2-3 weeks of dating. I know of other people who basically get addicted to their dating apps and find it hard to quit them even once they're in a relationship. So it's going to vary from person to person.
5	I am also a female your age, and from my experience, guys that do sketchy things will continue to do sketchy things.  \n\nI do think there is an addiction to dating apps that people can have.  If he still needs female attention while he’s literally hanging out with a girl he asked to be exclusive with, he’s going to continue that trend most likely.  \n\nI would get out now before your emotions get too involved if it were me.  
4	He’s already lied to your face. You need to drop him. Relationships are built on trust, if there’s no trust then there’s no point to the relationship. 
3	one of the hardest things for an ENFJ to do is to love themselves. Walk away. If you cannot be treated respectfully and honorably then they are not worth your time. 
3	Get out you'll definitely find someone better, Yes it definitely is easier said than done but think about it, If he's so ok lying and being such a douche than what is to say he'll change if it gets more serious, Yes there definitely is a chance but it seems very smalll to me.
3	He lied. Give him the boot
3	Oh no honey, you RUN and you don’t EVER look back! I dealt with enough idiots like him when I was on OKC. You deserve so much more! 
3	Ew. Leave and find someone better. \n\nIt’s hard to answer your second question, probably depends from person to person. But for sure you should walk away from this guy, you can’t trust him. He was in bed with you when it happened, it’s a miracle you didn’t smash his face! 
3	you must end it. don't accept a liar. i'm sorry
3	Ditch him. If he does it once he is almost guaranteed to do it again. He's obviously a blantant liar and cannot be trusted. You don't want to be with someone like that.
2	god, hes a bitch. how can u get attracted to that shit ?  \nps im poliamorous, that disgusting lack of transparency doesnt come easy. u gotta be really weak
2	I probably would have smashed his phone to the ground and would have given no fucks.
1	Read modern romance by Aziz Ansari\n\nHe addresses the tinder elusion of choice 
6	This person strikes me as an ENFJ. It’s an uncanny hunch but I believe it is correct. She is working at one of her many middle stops towards her vision.	
25	I’ve found the majority of ENFJ’s (and ESFJ’s) are type 2 “the helper” on the enneagram	I think a lot of the unhealthy qualities or complaints I’ve read have nothing to do with being an ENFJ, but actually are due to a possibly less mature/unhealthy type 2. \nI’m personally a type 4 “the individualist,” so it really took me a long time to resonate with being an ENFJ.\nIt would make sense to me that most ENFJ’s are 2’s as they are driven by their need to be loved. \nIf anyone knows anything about the enneagram please put your thoughts into this! \n
9	Hello! I'm an ENFJ and a type 2. I definitely am driven by my need to be loved. HELP ME. 
4	1000%, the enneagram was the first time when I read my personality result and thought “wow someone really is writing down all my inner thoughts”. I love how the result is 3 dimensional. This is how i interpret the results: 1) who you are (2), 2) who you want to be (4) and 3) who you don’t want to be (8).\n\n1) generally love helping and derive a ton of happiness from it and from others. But 2) why do we do this? We have an inner drive that we desire to be unique and special to other people and ourselves. And 3) we hate being controlled and micromanaged (the 8 is the dominant, assertive type and that just don’t vibe too well with us In a very general sense). \n\nNothings gonna be 100% right but always found this test fascinating. Especially the write ups of the healthy and non healthy types — has helped me become more aware of some bad habits
3	I took the test and was a type 2 but a year later I was a type 4. The first time I took it and got 2 was a time when I was under stress so that could’ve been a contributing factor 
2	2 strong wing 3 here.  Enfj. We are usually a 2, but some of us are 3 with a strong 2 wing.
2	Im ENFJ type 8 cant relate with so many things about "ENFJ" . In my understanding, we are the same in how we function, arriving conclusion about something. But our motivation will decide what we are going to do with it. As a social ENFJ 8 I have tendency to assert control over the group in acceptable manner. I see this life is about people placing wills over on another so it matters to me if i want what i want, i will have to assert control a little bit over my surrounding. i love people dearly without expecting their love in return. 
2	Thanks for your comment! Im always evaluating where I’m at, so it’s a nice reminder to revisit the enneagram! 
2	I feel like the odd duck. I’m ENFJ with 1w2. I think it suits me, but I’m always curious why I’m the odd one out. 
1	I am an ENFJ and a 2 on Enneagram. I don't know if I agree with your perspective that we help out of a need to be loved. I help because I love to help and because I genuinely love people. Do I long to be loved? Everyone does but for the most part I help or give or aid because it makes me feel good to do so. 
1	I am an ENJF Type 2 and I find myself very giving in relationships that have no chance of ever being equally reciprocated. I feel as though I almost set myself up to be disappointed regularly by people. I have found that to maintain healthy platonic relationship boundaries, I have to force myself to give a friend as much as they are giving me; no more, no less out of spite.  I still tend to go way out of the way for people but knowing where these boundaries are help keep me mentally healthy and happy 🖤🖤
1	who doesn't want to be loved? (2 wing 3, seems that's most common)
1	We usually span from types 9 1 and 2
15	This is a video I (INFP) worked on with my friend (ENFP), and we're super proud of it. It's probably our most polished work yet. Our sense of humor can very abstract and philosophical and we thought some other NFs might enjoy it! :)	
3	I was somewhat entertained. Thanks lol
2	I thoroughly enjoyed this! Thank you. (ENFJ)
1	Pretty funny iN meta humor

5	ENFJs and trolling?	I was perusing an article naming the typical pet peeves of the different types, when I came across "trolling" being one of the top frustrating things for ENFJs. \n\nI'm a huge prankster. Never in a hurtful way, and never to people who would be offended by me goofing around. For example, I have a really thin roommate who I will tell people about and describe as "a huge 300lb woman", and every now and again I mention her bad eating habits. When friends actually meet her (this little 90pound woodland nymph) they realize I've been messing with them the whole time, and usually they get a kick out of it (and sometimes join in on the fun by exaggerating with me about how big she is to other friends). \nThat's just an example, but I do things that like often if I feel it'll bring a laugh. So I was surprised to see "trolling" was one of the ENFJs top pet peeves? \n\nI'd love to hear anyone elses opinion on trolling! Below is the link to the article: \n https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2019/02/12/pet-peeves-of-every-myers-briggs-personality-type/
8	trolling has a different implication than your lighthearted pranks, and i enjoy being ironic quite a bit as well (though for me it's not mean-spirited and with the intention that i'd be understood).\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntrolling could be described as: purposefully attempting to make others look like fools through deception; gaining pleasure in the frustration and chaos you cause and not intending for your victims to be in on the laugh\n\nin short: it sounds like you're probably aok by ENFJ standards
4	I like trolling and soaking up people's reactions.
1	To me, REAL trolling is disgusting. It’s basically trying to get a rise out of someone to get a reaction from them in hopes of making them look like a laughingstock.\n\nIt’s an extremely childish and immature thing to do. I think only people who are really insecure take it upon themselves to do so.\n\nIt’s all fun and games for them but you end up looking stupid if you give in to them.
0	That's not funny.
9	Dreaming about how you could be	If there was an exercise where you had to imagine a future for yourself, but one that has nothing to do with how things are now, how would you go about it?\n\nLike in a "dream big" way. It would have to relate to you, something you want to get to, but not something that already exists (but could).\n\nWhat is the process you would go through?
5	INFP here.  Dreaming is my specialty because I live in a perpetual day dream.  \n \nThis is how I made my dreams become reality.  The example I will use is my business.\n\nI work in corporate America.  I realized that I would eventually become over qualified and over paid as I grow closer to retirement. I've seen many times older people get laid off as they get close to retiring.  I also realized that I would have to support my parents as they reached retirement age.  So I knew I had to do something about it.  \n\nAt this point in time a friend of mine showed me how to brew beer. I instantly fell in love with brewing.  Not because I loved beer but because I love what beer meant. Brewing was a way to bring friends together.  \n\nSo my dream was to be financially independent and brewing beer is how I wanted to do it.  \n\nThe first thing i did was to fantasize about what it would be like to own a brewery.  I made brewing my passion and I would share my dreams with my friends while we shared some homebrew.  \n\nI talked about it to all my friends. Eventually some of them started believing my fantasies and my dream became their dream.  \n\nBefore I knew it's we were writing up a business plan and looking for a location to build my dream (our dream).\n\nThat was 7 years ago. Today the brewery is running strong.  We have 10+ employees and some of my friends have quit their jobs to work for the brewery.\n\nIt hasn't all been easy but it exists and it was all from a dream.  \n\nSo to recap.  Dream big. Fantasize about how it's going to be. Make it your passion and tell anyone who is willing to listen. Finally, put in the work. \n\nI've also done this same process to lose weight.  I have lost 80lbs and there are 7 people around me losing weight because of my dreaming. \n\nI hope this helps. 
2	There's a concept developed by Stephen Covey in his book '7 Habits of Highly Effective People,' in which he talks about beginning with the end in mind.\n\nIt's about visualizing your funeral and thinking about what different groups of people (namely: family, friends, co-workers) and thinking about what you want they to say to you, ideally.\n\nMy alternative way of doing this is pretending to step into a time machine and talking to yourself at the place where future 'you' lives, and holding a conversation about how you've become so successful in the future. You'll have to leave it to your intuition to imagine the set of values future 'you' would subscribe to- and that involves being true to yourself.\n\nIf you're an ENFJ, I'd suggest with thinking it through very slowly, and letting your intuition guide you. Always start with a few deep breaths :)
2	I need help trying to type my Mother	I am an INTP who got a little bit too obsessed with this MBTI thingy, as it was so precise that I could not see it as anything but true\n\nBecause of that I started to type most people around me but my mother and my sister are problems\n\nMy sister 'cause she never showed me anything at all but my mother... I don't know why\n\nWe've done the test and it never got really precise about her besides somethings many other personality types have in common\n\nSo I started thinking she might be an EXFJ (Even though it would seem she's hard to read which EXFJs in general are not, I'd say I'm just pretty bad at understanding feelers)\n\nBut I don't know I could be wrong\n\nSo here are some of her characteristics:\n\nShe works as dentist and she wanted to be one since her childhood (And because of that I can only see her as an Si Or Ni user)\n\nShe is proactive and she's always doing something\n\nShe's quite easily irritable, if I say something in a tune she didn't like she'll most probably start to yell at me... It would seem that it has to do with the pressure someone's giving her.\n\nShe literally explains things to me even when I already know how they work and things like that.\n\nShe's a little too much optimistic\n\nThe only thing she says she wants to do is to help others... That would be her life goal I guess\n\nWell she's married to an ISFJ so maybe that could help (especially when I can easily say they have never had problems with each other ever)\n\nShe does not like to think, at least not as much as I do...\n\nShe's been the warmest person in the room, and from what I've seen Fi users are a lot colder than Fe users especially when we're talking about extremes like an INTP vs an INTJ\n\nWell I don't know what more to say so\n\nI guess that's it...
5	Some of these things might also just be because you are her child.\nI wouldn’t obsess over this type stuff honestly
2	look at cognative functions. test results may vary because people like to answer as they "should" not as what they "would" do.
2	My hunch is INFJ. It’s a tricky one to figure out since they appear to be outwardly social and really care and help others. Always looking long term and gives unsolicited advice. Maybe you can read more about this type and see if it’s the one!

1	We on reddit.  You know how this will turn out 
8	Negative thought cycles	I keep overthinking or I get real negative and sort of spiral into this negative thought cycle and can't seem to break out of it... Does this happen to you guys? What do you do to break the cycle? Why does this happen? \n\nAlso I keep having sad/bad dreams about my boyfriend and can't help but think it's my subconscious telling me something... He's a great guy and I love him dearly, but I just woke up from a dream where people were telling me to break up with him because of the doubts I have about him. My doubts aren't based on who he is but my own fears and negativity.\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for your response. I've been reading them and referring back to them whenever I start to get negative. It means a lot to me that this sub seems to care so much and I get so much insight. ♥️
10	Regarding the negative spiral- I tend to get them a lot when I'm alone, and can really turn my days upside down. They tend to be around worrying that I might have hurt someone's feelings, or about my own value to other people in the long run. I also tend to fall into a spiral when I am deeply angered by someone (though this happens extremely rarely).\n\nFor me there are two ways to go about this: one is to just laugh about the situation. I think that sometimes, irrational thoughts can be solved by equally irrational solutions haha. The other is to put your negative feelings on a pedestal and really try to understand it. I like to turn my feelings into a mental 'other' and just try to converse with it logically and deduce where the negative thoughts are coming from, then I'll devise a plan to remedy it in the future. (eg. talking to the person I hurt more often, or sending a gift in the future.) [EDIT: actually on second thought, maybe don't do this while you're in a spiral.. definitely wait until you're in a calmer state]\n\nAbout the sad and bad dreams- I think we as ENFJs love answers but take the most convoluted paths towards them. Laugh a little, and try to appreciate him in other ways. I hope you will find what you are looking for in a relationship, but in the meantime remember to stay in the present :) 
6	You’re headed down a bad path. Things will get worse unless you take active measures to change your habits. It’s kind of like taking a hot bath in the winter. If you start the bath while in the tub, you can slowly increase the temperature until it’s very hot. You’re curious how hot the water can get. You think it might sooth you, but instead you leave the tub with a headache from dehydration. But if you set the bath before getting in, youd realize it was too hot and pull your feet out immediately. The point is you’re curious about the pain, you think maybe by thinking it over deeply you might find a solution. But you’re not really thinking, you’re allowing your emotions to take control. The key is when you find yourself caught in a negative feedback loop, is to train yourself to snap out of it - to yank your foot out of the hot water. Physically remove yourself from that environment and do something else. It may seem silly but it’s necessary to overcome this habit. Feel the room around you, your hand feeling the chair you might be sitting in. Think thoughts of gratitude. Do something good for yourself. There is no other solution but to break away. 
6	Or possibly it's not the negative thought cycle that's the problem, but it is symptomatic of certain aspects of your personality that 'kick in' in certain circumstances. For example 'I'm not good enough' may come from a range of sources - a parent who put you down, numerous experiences of failure in childhood, underlying insecurities about your looks or personality, etc. You are right - these thought-loops are born of your subconscious, but may be helpful to understand your subconscious has **no sense of time** which means a situation today might trigger a reaction born of an event when you were six years old and haven't yet processed. \n\nA thing that may help is to take notice of when these loops occur and consider what may be triggering them and if there is something in your past (or current) circumstances that may be associated with them - and understanding why it is happening can help you 'process' the subconscious trigger and reduce its power. \n\nRe your bf, honestly, it depends how old you are ;-) Actually dreams about breaking up etc could simply be manifestations about your general anxiety about being in a relationship which is important to you. On the other hand, maybe subconsciously you could harbour doubts... in any case, try not to overthink and enjoy yourself. As long as you're happy with him, why worry? 
2	It happens to me. Noticing the cycle is the first step in breaking the cycle as far as what stops it I’ve been trying to figure that out for years. 
2	I do this negative-thinking spiralling as well. It’s really hard to get out of when I’m on my own but my boyfriend recognizes when it’s happening and  once I’m called out for it, I can see how it’s not getting me anywhere and try to distract myself with something else. 
2	If there are good reasons for you to doubt him then sit down for a moment a really think about it. We ENDJs sometime willfully blind ourselves because were so hopeful.\n\nIf it’s coming in your dreams it’s probably something that you need address in real life. \n\nIt could be something about him that just doesn’t work out between you two. Don’t waste time and stay with someone who’s hurting you, there are indirect ways of being in toxic relationships. Sometimes people are not meant to be with one another 
2	In order to break a negative thought cycle, I started reviewing the stories I tell myself. Instead of saying "Sometimes I hate myself" interally I started saying "Sometimes I love myself because..." and I give myself some good compliments, as my kindness, sticking to my values (such as humility, equality and culture of peace and non-violence)
2	No problem, you are enlightened and as funny as it sounds being enlightened can be a heavy load to carry sometimes. Glad I could provide some comfort to you :). 
48	This poem by April Hill Writing reminded me of ENFJs.	
5	I'm on a "love and anything related" kind of strike, but that really spoke to me. <3
21	What makes sex good for you?	The most important thing for me is to see my partners orgasm and the satisfaction on their face. It makes me happy to give happiness. :)\n\n&#x200B;
15	Specific to this sub and ENFJ - I'm most happy when my wife initiates sex, as opposed to me doing it.  I don't know if that's my ENFJ talking or not.  At first thought, I'd say no - because we like to be in control.  But it also might be the rush I get being wanted, essential to my partner - ENFJ's love to be wanted.
8	Same. I don’t need anything, sex isn’t a need, and I don’t get upset if I don’t finish every time or whatever. I only truly care about pleasuring the woman I love. If she loves me she will do the same but it’s not on my mind
14	Yes, this. But if a partner *doesn't* think this then... what are you doing?\n\nMy point is: for the love of God *get what you need out of it too*. I'm beginning to lose my shit with the amount of times ENFJs play up the archetype that we only feel (and should only feel) good when we serve others. Are you getting what *you* want too?
8	First and foremost a heart to heart connection. Then pleasing her over and over, which continously builds me. Then the culmination of her satiation with mine. 
6	The heights of emotional and physical union
10	Mutual attraction, mutual enjoyment, mutual lust and tempo. The word you are looking for is mutual.
5	Connection, both the emotional and the physical
4	Attentiveness and appreciation. I’m not sure why but I always fall for the people who put extra effort into the little things. The ones that make eye contact, kiss you on your shoulders, gently caress you. The ones who care to learn who you are as a human and cherish you when you open up. Gentleness and transparency turn me on ❤️
3	Rough housing. 
3	YES! OH MY GOSH! YES! There's nothing as satisfying as bringing her to ecstasy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I'm extremely playful in bed. So, when a girl reaches up for a kiss, I'll start to go in. Bu then, just at the moment when our lips would touch, I'll pull back. That millisecond of subverting her expectations and making her want me even more, that's just the best feeling in the world. Of course, then I'll dive in for a long and passionate kiss.

46	ENFJ motto	Something I said to a colleague months ago, before knowing my MBTI type:\n\n"If someone asks me for the moon, I'll try to reach for the galaxy, but only give them the solar system, and be sad because I wish I could give them the universe."\n\nA colleague told me this when congratulating me for my work:\n\n"The level of perfection you ask from everyone (and yourself), cannot be reached by anyone, not even yourself."\n\nThese statements really embody who I am as a person, even if I sometimes wish they didn't.\n\nWhat are yours?
18	Mine would be to ”lift others as I climb” because I can’t really seem to justify *most* self gain without ensuring that I am positively affecting someone/my community.\n\n“Don’t let yourself burn just to keep others warm.”\n- another quote I say to remind myself of boundaries when helping lol
5	"Love is only a gift." Is my motto. I honestly feel like I am always bleeding love. I give sacrificially and never realized no one would do that for me.  I have to ask myself why am I doing all this.  If I can answer love is a gift, I may be okay but then I start thinking, I MATTER, "I AIN'T SANTA CLAUS." But matter how many times I do say it I realize "I AM FREAKING SANTA CLAUS." 
4	i'm feeling very attacked
3	Lately I've been saying this a lot that maybe this could also be a relatable motto:\n"I love *insert these passions here*. I love people. I love getting people excited about *insert passions previously mentioned". 
1	Mine lately would be being kind to others and showing compassion even in hard and difficult situations.  \n"Gentle breezes of a kindling warmth is better than the bitter coldness of silence."\n\n"The joy and compassion and acts of kindness is worth every shared value while expecting none in return and appreciating plenty."
1	“Be who you are and say what you feel for those that mind don’t matter and those that matter don’t mind”- dr Seuss. I am an EXFJ (kind of in the middle of ESFJ and ENFJ). I tend to find that I limit who I am, and change who I am and how I act in order to fit what others want me to be and to be the best person towards them.  This quote reminds me that some people just don’t matter, and I shouldn’t let myself be taken advantage of by them. 
1	Love's not love if it's an obligation. Love is when you are happy to have helped someone, not when you're happy that you've helped them so you can finally do someone else now.
1	OP your mottos are so much the embodiment of an ENFJ.\n\nI just want to love everyone with the fierceness of ten thousand suns.
11	ENFJ with depression and anxiety	After learning I was an ENFJ it suited me very well except that I could definitely see myself in an INFJ. I felt like I wasn’t sure what was really me and felt like maybe I was an INFJ trying to be an ENFJ. It wasn’t until discussing this with my boyfriend (who knows me better than anyone else) that he pointed out that I am definitely an E and it’s probably my depression and anxiety that make me an act like an I. Once I thought about this it made sense. I instinctively think like an E but then slowly start thinking and acting like an I. When I think back to before my depression and anxiety started I was 100% an E.  I thought this was really interesting and wondered if anyone else has experienced this?
12	I’m an ENFJ with depression & anxiety as well; when I was REALLY going through it (aka before I started therapy/when I first started therapy and before I was on meds), I felt like such a hollow shell of myself. It was scary cause I could barely recognize the outgoing, empathetic, and driven ENFJ I had always known myself to be. It was like I could see the real me somewhere deep down inside, but I couldn’t reach her. It was so strange and honestly felt like an out of body kind of experience. But like I said, therapy and (in my case) medication definitely helped bring me back to life and helped me get to a place where I could feel like myself again. The depression/anxiety will definitely have an effect on that “E” part but just remember that the real ENFJ you is still somewhere in there! You just have to find ways to rediscover yourself, whatever (hopefully safe) method that might be :) 
5	Yes! I have both depression and anxiety. Also, ENFJ is more of a guideline, I’m sure if you take the test on different days and in different mood you get different results, but more often than not, you’d end up being ENFJ. Just my $.02
4	I definitely questioned myself too if I was an INFJ because I would depress my extraversion during times of anxiety and stress in my high school  and undergrad years. But what helped me through it was reflecting on times when I felt like myself and how I acted during those times (which was acting on feeling/being extroverted and intuition [which makes sense as they are ENFJ’s primary and secondary preferred function, respectively]) as well as talking to a friend of mine who was an MBTI master practitioner. He explained to me that an ENFJ’s inferior function is Ti or thinking, and (this might not be how you’re supposed to see it but it’s helpful for me to understand myself) when I am anxious or stressed I overthink too much and tend to withdraw from the world, which I could perceive as introversion. \n\nSo TLDR: yes I definitely can relate! 
2	I’m so glad to hear that! Starting meds is tough for many reasons and it’s not an easy decision to make but if they’re helping you to find yourself again then I’d call that a success. 
2	Definitely. I've always been outgoing and making friends wherever I go. But my anxiety in social situations has hurt me so much in the past I started thinking I could not handle other humans, and identifying as an introvert early on.\n\nI still don't do crowds, and I still have anxiety, but learning to deal with it has made me realize I'm much more extravert than I ever thought.\n\nI hope you find something that helps you with your anxiety and depression. It's hard to go through life with this, but it's worth it.
11	Let’s Talk About INFPs	Hey you crazy kids!\n\nWhat are your thoughts on INFPs? I’d love to hear about your experiences with the INFPs in your lives. \n\nWhat are some things that worked harmoniously in your dynamic? What elements caused friction?
8	y'all bang on and on about them and I've never bloody met one
6	This thread made me laugh.  I'm an INFP and one of my best friends is an ENFJ.  He's Mr. Popular and makes everyone feel like his best friend. \n\nI can't speak for any other personality type, but being an INFP is pretty tough.  I find it really hard to date people for whatever reason.  As much as I care for people, I don't have many close friends.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a singer/songwriter and love using music as a way to connect with people and heal them.  I know that sounds dumb and idealistic to people, but it's true.  I love expressing myself through my music.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also do ridesharing and like listening to people one on one and chatting with them.  People get really deep.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think for me, with women, I can get pretty deep and intense too quickly and come across as needy, weird and insecure.  If I like you, it's like "I LIKE YOU" and it's hard for me to stop the insanity.  INFP are also prone to be indecisive, another trait women just LOVE in men...lol.  I naturally get close to people and I think that kinda' just freaks people out.  People don't like to get deep with their feelings and shit..but I do.  Life's taught me to chill out and I'm getting better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just met an INFJ last week and instantly fell in love.  It was pathetic.  I could not help myself.  We just clicked on everything.  Honestly, I was not really expecting anything from our date.  Course she starts blowing me off and I had to go write a song to process my emotions.  I'm just about over her now, but I got a cool song out of all the heartache and now I can pass that on to others.  That makes all the pain worth it.  Many of my songs, if not all, come out of personal experience.  Most of them painful.  And when I get clarity on a situation in the form of a song, I can help others heal their wounds or see things in a different light.  In that sense, I see myself as a spiritual healer, and that makes me feel purposeful and special.  Like it's my calling.  I relate with Luke Skywalker and Frodo Baggins.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess we're all heroes in some way, shape or form...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's my lyric for the tune..peace, love and Bob Marley...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Beautiful Girl**\n\nI’m driving down a dark, country road\n\nWind in my hair, headlights come and go\n\nThe smell of the pines, the damp of the dew\n\nHer countenance shines like the light of the moon\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeautiful girl, she’s on my mind tonight\n\nBeautiful girl, I want her by my side\n\nBeautiful girl, she’s everywhere I see\n\nBeautiful girl, I’m lost in reverie\n\nReverie\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMars and Venus dance high in the sky\n\nWhere diamonds and rubies sparkle and shine\n\nMy tires keep churning to sad country songs\n\nWhile I dream about her, dream about her all night long\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeautiful girl, she’s on my mind tonight\n\nBeautiful girl, I want her by my side\n\nBeautiful girl, she’s everywhere I see\n\nBeautiful girl, I’m lost in reverie\n\nReverie\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe sun’s creeping up at the end of the road\n\nAnd I know it’s time for me to let her go\n\n‘Cause she don’t love me, love me the same\n\nAnd I pray to Jesus, Lord please take my pain\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeautiful girl, she’s on my mind tonight\n\nBeautiful girl, I want her by my side\n\nBeautiful girl, she’s everywhere I see\n\nBeautiful girl, I’m lost in reverie\n\nReverie\n\nShe’s got me lost in reverie, reverie, reveire\n\nWatch me fade into the sun\n\nWatch me fade into the sun
6	Hi! My boyfriend of a year and some change is an INFP. \n\nThings we are great at- balancing each other out. I tell him I want something, he helps me go after it, He "logics" himself into a mood I can be optimistic and cheery and give him hope and a future. We are both very perceptive and both like intelligent humor, we're both great communicators and we both love coaching and teaching and lifting each other up, we are both very committed to each other always putting priority on each other and our relationship above trivial things,  \n\nFriction points- Sometimes he doesn't understand why things are hard for me to do because of my emotions, but to him it's simple-just do it, I need to just vent to him and talk to him about how I feel and cry and not have him tell me how to fix it (this may be just a m/f thing) I always want to go on group dates, do things with friends and crowds and people and he very very much does not-ever, \n\nI'm sure there's more, but that's the first things that popped into my head
5	INFPs. I just cannot understand why I click so much with them but I do. Maybe they deal better with extraversion in others, maybe they see more easily when we try hard and also when we are playing and are not to be taken seriously... I don't know.\n\nFriction... well, sometimes I forget to get in touch and fear they would take it personal. Sometimes their apparent indecisiveness asks for some patience, but they are so considerate and patient themselves all around that no one can get really angry with them.
3	I am an EXFJ (between ESFJ and enfj). I am a litteral INTP, INFP magnet. I think perhaps I am attracted to their differences from me. Me and my INFP friends get along in such harmony it feels like I can practically read their minds. Areas of harmony include general conversation, socializing (not in large groups), games, emotional support, and conflict resolutions. Friction may include try are often disorganized which can be frustrating, they are difficult to share an occupation with (because they have difficulty with planning). Honestly the I am very happy with all of my INFP friends. 
2	Hello Sunshine and Sass, \n\nThanks for the comment on my post! I really appreciate it! I’ll return the favor! Luckily I have met one of my best friends who is an INFP, luckily we get along great! We also come up with extraordinary ideas than normal people and just really do not care about social standards! (which kind of took me some time to get used to) Otherwise, they are awesome people who care about the world. However, they can be really hard to get to know at first, but they are totally different people in a good way once you break the ice! It’s like shyness to craziness, which is one thing why INFP’s are awesome! Also, I have met some of which I have not clicked with. I know tons of them and the INFP can take things very personally, which is why I don’t really get along with some of them. Also, I saw where you are debating if you are a ENFP or INFP. \n\n\nHere is a link with that primarily discusses the differences! Hope this helps! 😁\nhttps://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/09/523471/\n
1	This warmed my heart! :)
15	I just want to settle down with someone nice and get married (a vent feel free to ignore)	I'm only 18 but I really want to settle down already. is that weird?\n\nI think it's because everyone constantly lets me down apart from my family and I feel like if I get married that'll be a confirmation from another human being that they'll be there for me through thick and thin. \nas it stands I'm incredibly lonely. 90% of my plans fall through. I got flaked on 6 times the other week. it's the most horrific feeling. I've dealt with varieties of abuse and been through some very tough circumstances but there is no deep, gut-wrenching pain quite like having promising people flake on you. I just wish people would mean what they say. 
10	I feel you. I think marriage isnt what you want as much as you probably want genuine commitment haha but I do relate to that as well... it's miserable having flakey people in your life when you would move the moon just to make someone smile.
4	Girl, I feel you! But I agree with @igotbangz on you just really wanting commitment. Like who wants a scrub who can’t commit. I sure don’t lol. But for me I’ve always kind of wanted to find “the one” who goes through everything with me. 
5	I'm an ENFP and I've wanted to get married since I was 18. I love the idea of such a deep, all-encompassing commitment... but it would have to be with someone remarkably compatible to work long-term. I've never been married and only had one serious dating relationship, and I'm 27 now. I'm not giving up hope though! \n\nA couple of things to keep in mind is that the part of your brain that makes decisions isn't fully developed until you're 25, so I'd be a little cautious about making significant commitments before that age. Also there is evidence that getting married after dating two or more years decreases the risk of divorce, so I wouldn't rush into something. \n
3	I am ENFJ and have literally wanted to get married since I was 15, i think it’s our fascination with love. it took a couple of relationships that were really really hard, but I’m engaged to the most amazing man now. It’ll come with time when you least expect it. Never settle. As much as you want a long term relationship. It’s not worth it if you aren’t treated with  respect and loved unconditionally. 
3	Don't try to rush it. You will eventually find someone you want to spend your life with and who wants to spend it with you. That person is worth waiting for. Don't just marry any random partner because you feel they are then obliged to stay with you. That shit is doomed to fail. 
3	Lol I feel like I’m the weird one who doesn’t want to get married. But having someone who’s always there for you is nice but you don’t need to be married to find that. 
2	I have no idea if I want a relationship again. I would if I knew it was going to last. They are so great when it’s genuine but it can turn toxic out of no where n abso blow up in your face. I’m only 18 as well but after my previous relationships, knowing how much it hurts when they end up leaving is enough for me to just stop seeking them out. If it happens naturally then it would be great but I’m trying to focus on myself even tho it can be lonely as FUCK. (INFP) 
14	What’s your favorite type as an ENFJ?	Hello Everyone, \n\nJust out of curiosity, what’s everyone’s favorite type that they get a long with? 
23	ENFJ
17	ISTP/INTP. I do well with people that aren’t emotional because I’m too emotional myself. Lol. 
12	INTJs - one of my best friends and my younger brother are INTJ and I just enjoy them and love talking through the often existential crisis that is occupying their brains currently.\n\nWith my life partner I am super lucky as he is an ENTJ who is very in touch with his emotions so lots of deep conversations, ambition and a great balance to me.
4	ENFJ and ESFJ for sure!!! 
8	- ENFJ\n- ESTJ\n- ENFP\n- INFP
7	ENFJ, INFJ, ENTJ, INTJ, INFP, INTP, ENFP, ENTP
6	Close friends:\n\n- xSFJ for closer friendships.\n- ISFP and xSTP to have in the general friend groups.\n- ENTP to spice things up.\n- INFPs for partners in crime and to get weird with and cry together.\n- ENTJ for same same but different and more career-driven.\n- INFJs for same same same same same but only slightly different. They just get me and vice versa. They're more cynical but so excellent for, me: "I'm thinking x, is that crazy?" them: "nah bro I think the same way" me: "OH THANK GOD" both: "HEHEHEHEHEHE".\n\n\nGood for the lols/chats but not necessarily inner circle:\n\n* ESFP to get my Se going.\n* INTx to get my thinking going and chatting.\n* ESTJ for small talk.\n\n\n
3	I wish I could type people easily! I had a hard enough time typing myself. I only know the type of one friend, the others is just speculation.\n\nI'm stuck with the old "personality quirks" way of doing things. :D\n\nBut my ENFP friend is pretty great.
3	Enfj, infp, estp, enfp, infj, and esfj in that order lol
3	INTP/J lol, depending on certain aspects as I appreciate INTP's Ti, which is ENFJ's Achilles' Heel, and INTJ's Ni, which is ENFJ's main support in understanding the world.
5	INFJ!
4	ENFJ, INFP, ENFP, INTJ, INFJ
2	ENFJ, ENTJ, INFJ, INTJ, INTP, ENFP, INFP\n\nI'd say with ISFJs my relatioships with them are usually surface level while it's quit the opposite with INXX, Not to mention how well INTs are for emotional venting.
2	Any NFs
2	INFP (One of you fuckers marry me already), ENFP(Best friends), ISFP (Especially women), INTJ, ENTJ. I don't have enough experience with other ENFJ's to know.
1	I tend to drift subconsciously most towards INFJs, they’re usually my closest friends. I get along really well with ESFJs and ISFPs next, have great conversational chemistry with ENTPs (my bf is ENTP) & ENTJs, but INTx often intrigues me. Mostly INTJs. But maybe that’s because my sister is an asshole INTP, so I haven’t met many particularly enjoyable ones that I can recall.
1	My very best friend and love is INTJ \n\nTwo of my lifelong friends are ESFP - they get me out of my comfort zone.\n\n
1	ENTJ, INFJ, ISFJ, ENFP! 
1	INTJ\n\nINFP\n\nENFP\n\nENTJ
12	Are Male ENFJ’s rare?	Hello Everyone, \n\nBeing a fellow ENFJ Male myself, wondering if there were any on reddit! Since it is one of the rarest personalities in men! Thanks! 
15	Male ENFJ here. Funny, it never occurred to me that anything other than a 50-50 split of male to female would be the case. 
9	According to my research, ENFJ personality is very rare in men. We are the second most rare animals in this crazy jungle. It's either 3 or 6 percent of the population. Can't remember which.
7	I am a male ENFJ. I wasn't aware it was a rare personality in males.
4	I’m one, and I married an ENFJ lady as well!
2	Had no idea male ENFJ's were rare, rad.
2	Hi there 👋 
2	Hola. 
2	Sup. Enfj male
2	hello 
2	I have never seen others irl and i have never seen so many in 1 subreddit post
2	the tests say that i too am one of this rare breed. i guess you came to the right place bro
2	Also a male ENFJ! 
2	Hello fellow male ENFJ!
2	My best friend is an ENFJ male, I don't think gender really plays a part in MBTI xD
1	I would like to meet more of you anyone interested in chatting pm me. 
1	Yeah I don’t know any other enfj males 
1	Ciao !\nYeah just like the other comments, had no idea this was a rare phenomena 
1	Male ENFJ here. Also have at least one male friend who is ENFJ. But you know, if you divide humanity into 32 parts (16 x male and female) any one part will be less than five percent. We are all rare. 
1	I noticed that there were much more females on this reddit and thats how I made the assumption that we are more rare, Not to mention that I am the only ENFJ I know in real life, Though I have met some online, I do think though that females are more likely to be feelers than Thinkers because like all the guys I know are XNTX While with girls it's usually XNFX and yes I barely get close to S types please don't kill me so I'd say it's quite the opposite with ENTJs and I think if someone takes a look at the ENTJ reddit they could tell.
1	Yep! It’s not very common! 
1	ENFJ male here (looks like we’re all checking in here lol) but I have a brother and a couple guy friends who are also ENFJ. Feel free to debate this, but I think society’s stereotype of what a man “should be” isn’t really ENFJ (feelings, love, etc etc.) and that’s why we don’t see it as much. Think this may be due some nature vs nurture leaning on the nurture side of the debate? Either way, I find that myself and my friends love being an ENFJ and wouldn’t have it any other way. 
1	I am an enfj male and I guess this explains why I usually connect easily to women on a deeper level rather then other guys my age. They are not as upbeat or passionate about anything it’s odd. Though I do find gems and have few close make friends who are capable of contemplating and communicating at the pace I do
1	Do either of you feel like you aren’t necessarily a superior being but like you have a lot to share because you’re so positive that it makes you feel like you are just on the outside looking in at all the negativity that needs to be fixed? It’s a very lonely feeling sometimes but also great because we’re so naturally enlightened. 
1	I (f/ENFJ) am lucky to know a few ENFJ men in person! One is my brother, and another is one of my good friends. Y'all are so much fun to be around! They both rile me up (in excitement) better than anyone else can. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also hear a lot in this sub that people haven't met ENFJs IRL. I know a ton, but I also come from a family of teachers which I believe is a common profession for ENFJs. Maybe that's why. Anyway, glad to see so many of y'all saying hi! As a fellow ENFJ i'm pumped to have ya here! (tip on knowing an ENFJ is posting: count the exclamation points...)
1	Male ENFJ here..come to think of it, I don't know many (if any) other male ENFJs..
1	I’m the only one I know
1	I'm an enfj. I haven't met many other dudes who are.  I wonder how many of us on here are also gay like myself.  
1	I'm an enfj male. I haven't met that many others. I wonder how many of the dudes on here are also a gaybro like myself. 
1	Yeah. They're pretty rare actually. ENFJ males make up about 1.5 percent of the general population. One of the rarest male architypes, next to infps and infjs
4	Study tips please.	I know this isn't a study site and what not. But I need help. So I decided I should ask my type if they have any study tips. Study tips for classes such as US history and Chemistry. Anything could help. I'm trying not to lose hope, but I have to have all As this semester. I know the semester just started but I can see how everything is going and how it'll end. I'll make a C or fail a test have- back up work and my grade would roll over to a B+. I have 2 +As and the rest are high Bs. I've hardly ever failed a test or produced a C until now. I'm not sure what it is. So please help me. Thank you. 
4	Do you find yourself easily distracted when you are trying to study? That has happened to me a lot before.  The best way to approach chemistry (for myself anyway) is to draw everything up nicely. The chemical formulas and structures, draw them all out and label them.\n\nUs ENFJs generally enjoy pretty visuals, and it can help us remember details by drawing and writing them out on paper. 
2	Are you in high school or university? What kind of chemistry?
2	Turn off your phone while you're studying. Otherwise it's just a source of distraction.\n\nDon't study for more than 30 minutes at a time. After those 30 minutes, reward yourself with something - be it a snack, some music, a short video, *something.* Then get back to it.\n\nFind out what noise level works best for you. Some people prefer to study with some noise, a lot of noise, or no noise at all. Try to get to an environment that can accommodate your preference.
2	Flashcards were a life saver for me in college and high school.\n\nPut your question on side and the right answer on the backside. I would shuffle them up and then just go through them all. I would read the question and guess the answer. If i got it right that card went in one pile and if i got it wrong it went in another. Once I had gone through the whole stack I would then go back and work through the missed answer pile and did correct/missed answer piles again. I would go through that cycle until ingot every answer right.\n\nThen I would put all the cards back together again, shuffle, and start over.\n\nAnother thing that might help, if you're a visual person like me, is use colored pencils or colored ink on the answers you struggle most with. I found a colored text helped me remember the answer easier on test day because it created an addition visual element to the material.
2	What are you currently doing with chemistry? I may be able to help you out there, since i'm having chemistry as a course in uni. What i did with history was making chronological summaries, with the date in front, and then then a short explanation of what happened next to it. Once you got that settled out, then you can try to make a story or song out of it, since most people tend to remember stories/songs better than raw data. And some general tips for studying: make sure you have nothing else on your mind ( as in deadlines ) so take care of the rest first. Take breaks after 45-60 minutes for no more than 10 minutes and walk arround for a bit during your break. Get some fresh air after 4-5 hours of studying. Make sure to eat well and go to bed on time
2	I took both APUSH and organic chemistry. For APUSH, try to write down the events as cause and effect. Having things visualized helped me to memorize the details.\n\nFor orgo, doing practice problems and figuring out the patterns is what made things click for me. This applies to gen chem as well so give it a try.
1	I chose to take classes that I liked, which helped with being motivated to study. So I never took US history. But now I wish I did so I can relate more to Hamilton the Musical (x\n\nFor chem, I would definitely use Cornell notes style like take notes on the right and have questions on the left side so that if I review, I can look at the question and test myself - I can then read the answer to the right. Boom! A ready made test and answer guide you made yourself. Khan Academy is a good resource too, and looking at MCAT study books that simplify stuff. Talking it out with friends (or friends who are just a bit smarter and on top of it) so you know what you know and don’t know is best. Drawing out processes, getting a tutor, doing problem tests/tests from the teacher or professor because they usually test the same. \n\nUS history, I’ll just use my background in taking World History. Again, I loved AP World, so it might have just been my enthusiasm but I talked about it a lot with family. I would also use Cornell notes and these helped me memorize the information needed. 
21	Any non-religious ENFJs out there?	We seem to be a very God-Fearing type based off some studies.\n\nMy parents aren’t strictly religious, but they are. Despite this, from the age of 4 I thought the idea of Heaven was too convenient. I consider myself agnostic.
12	Non-religious here. I find religion fascinating, and I love learning about it, but I don’t practice. I was raised Lutheran, and made many friends in the church. I learned some good things there, but after high school I found my belief in God to make less and less sense. I loved taking religious studies classes in college, for the same reason I enjoyed taking political science classes - both are extremely powerful subjects that people will kill and die for. The fanaticism is ultimately what turned me off I think. 
10	YES atheist. I do my helping people without the hope of a reward. But was raised in a cult. 
5	I was raised in a Christian family but I’m a very logical person when it comes to that type stuff. Emotional with people, logical with science and greater mysteries.
2	I believe in some higher power but I tend to challenge my own beliefs frequently. My parents raised me as Hindu but they don’t get upset when I challenge religion as a whole. I’m definitely not god-fearing though. I see them more as a guide in times of need or if I get really lucky, I’ll thank them. Bottom line, I would say I’m agnostic
2	Athiest all the way. I love science, and the idea of a god does not fit into my world view. Also, I am a massive gan of magic mushrooms. As an ENFJ i feel like nothing gets me like shrooms man. Also, on shrooms I ponder about religion and existentialism. 
2	Not religious!! Just admire the Buddhist practice that actions speak louder than any bible of written scripture. I was raised Christian but said nope this is BS lol 
2	Yes, I identify as Atheist. 
2	I am always curious about this because apparently we are the type most likely to believe in a higher power.  I am atheist, though agnostic.  I am happy to see that there are fellow atheist ENFJs.  
3	My parents are Buddhists and around my middle-high school years, put me in some buddhist girl scout program that I had to go to every Sunday.  I really did not like doing it at all and it made me feel like they were forcing their beliefs down my throat.  The kids in the program were also very cliquey and I didn't really like how the environment was.  I like to do things if it is my choice, and in this case it wasn't.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I grew up, I also saw a lot of reigious extremists who would do a lot of horrible things to people in the name of whatever religion they followed.  My best friends are Christian/Catholic and they were probably the only nice religious people I knew at the time.  I feel like I am agnostic and that maybe there is a higher power up there observing us and bad things happen because it's what free will is all about.  If said higher power were to intervene, it would violate our free will.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy views on religion pretty much solidified in college when one of my best friends got dumped by his girlfriend "in the name of god".  She believed that he wasn't devoted enough to God  and for that she needed to let him go so that he could "find his way".  A few months later, she tried to get back with him and at that point he had already moved on.  He was pretty messed up by this whole scenario and went from being religious to also being agnostic.  (He was also about to propose to her).  At this point, she stated that he should follow God's example of forgiveness and that she cried every day they were apart.  In my head, I'm viewing her as using God to excuse her actions and basically not even considering how my friend was affected by her actions.  I felt like she was blinded by her faith to the point where she couldn' t see how hypocritical she was in this entire situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn terms of pros of religion.  \n\n* It gives people reason to network and unify together.  Having the same faith gets people together and essentially creates a family out of strangers.\n* It helps encourage volunteer work and helping others.  Many religions do charity stuff and try to help those in need.\n* It also gives people a sense of hope in the most shittiest of situations.  Like sometimes life can be a real struggle and people do need some sort of faith to keep them going.\n* It provides confidence and stability\n* It establishes a foundation for everyone to stand on\n\nBut then the cons of religion.\n\n* People use it as a reason to excuse their actions, it kinda gets in the way of accountability.  Like if they do something good, its because of whatever religion and if they're doing something bad, they do it in the name of whoever they worship\n* It can cause people to be like blind sheep, following whatever they are told and not be open minded at times.  It also can cause tribalism where it's them vs everyone else.\n* People under religion seem to do things to expect something good in the afterlife.  People should do good things without expecting a reward.\n* People rely on something to fix their problems for them, instead of doing it themselves.  "thoughts and prayers" don't really help people who lost their homes in natural disasters or something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's my take on religion.  I think it's great in some ways, but when taken too far, it can really do a lot more harm than good.  I prefer to take things into my own hands and make something out of my own efforts.  
1	Sorry not here
1	I’m more or less deist.
1	Me I am an atheist for life 
1	Yes! I'm agnostic, but both my parents are quite religiously Hindus 
1	I was raised that way, but figured out it was bullshit. I'm not exactly atheist but I'm just aware things are bullshit.
1	I've always had trouble wrapping my mind around something as binary as heaven and hell.  I've been agnostic for the majority of my life.  I don't need a bearded man in the sky as a reason to be nice to people and just be an overall good person.  I have more happiness that way
1	Pretty much not religious. 
1	I'm not religious. I feel connection with people and nature and practice meditation to relieve stress.
1	Formerly religious (Roman Catholic) but not anymore. I used to derive humility, gratitude and purpose from “God”. However, these are things that we draw from within and others around us. Haven’t gone to church regularly in years (only go on Christmas and Easter with my grandmother). \n\nThere’s also the wild inconsistencies with religion as a whole; organized religion, religious institutions, systemic issues within the religious order etc that I have a major problem with. Mainly that I think many religious groups prey (pray lmao) on the emotionally vulnerable/those who aren’t as educated (obviously not saying that believers are dumb, but perhaps religion serves as a means to fill a moral void?) AND also take your money in exchange for a theological merit system, where the final prize for a promised afterlife? Yeah not super into that. \n\nTo bring it full circle with the ENFJ type, I think some of us want to not have our own compulsions for altruistic action, or for helping others to seem self motivated. My dad, his mother, and my girlfriend are also ENFJ’s lmao. My grandmother is the only one still actively religious, and she says that she wants to do good because it is her job as a Christian “to be an extension of the lord”. \n\nTLDR My father, girlfriend and I are ENFJ’s and not religious, but my grandmother is because the traits associated with the ENFJ type are usually promoted in the “community outreach” mandates of church groups. \n\nHope that is in anyway useful
1	Agnostic with respect to most religions. Athiest with respect to the Abrahamic religions. They make many factual claims that are demonstrably false, so I know they aren't true. \n\nHowever, if I found a religion I liked and that couldn't be disproven, I might believe in it. I've always been very interested in mythology and spiritual beliefs, but the only religions I have much knowledge about are false and/or have abhorrent moral teachings. Hell is such a severe punishment, that even the worst human couldn't do anything bad enough to deserve it. Eternal torture is an infinite punishment for finite crime, and thusthe punishment will always be far worse than the crime.\n\nAlso, the people who respond to this post will not provide a sufficient sample in all likelihood and if this were a poll, it would suffer from selection bias due to being on reddit and the question mostly attracting the ENFJs particularly interested in this question(ie other non-religious ENFJs). I know this isn't meant to be a poll, and this isn't a critisism of you, but I just don't think you'll really get a good idea of whether ENFJs in general are more relgious or not. 
1	didn't know this wasa thing lol I am religious
1	Absolutely I am not religious. It seems daunting and useless to believe in it. My synapses is I do not know, may not ever know, what life is. I know know my senses and what they pick up. I love tripping in imagination though I remember it’s not real. So imagining god doesn’t work for me.
2	Need help typing my Mom (ENFx)	Hello all! I need some help typing my Mom (I'll ask her later to do the test), I know she must be ENF-X, but I can't figure out if she's ENFP (like me but a healthy and more mature one) or ENFJ. We're both pretty close so I know her character and personality very well, until now the biggest difference I find between us is the fact that she can make a plan and stick to it. Though, I'm not sure... Can you guys help me figure this out? \n\nThx in advance!! :D  
3	Look at cognative functions and what not.
21	I hate being an enfj	The second i got the enfj result, i was sooo hypeed. For the longest, i had been typed as an enfp and while i thought it was a dope type, the enfj seemed to fit me soo well. But problem, recently i've been feeling a bit :( about my type. It just seems so bland. Every other type has cool quirks or unique traits whereas as an enfj, i feel like a cardboard box. Plain enough for others to place things into. Its exhausting being soo diplomatic and accessible. Sometimes, i wonder if the enfjs werent so proactive in terms of making friends, would people be attracted to us. \n\n\n I wonder if any other enfjs feel the sane way. \n\nAND YOOOOO, ITS SO HARD TO FIND OTHER ENFJS 
53	People are attracted to us.  The very being of an ENFJ is being there for others, and that on it's own makes us magnets for people.  You need to check your cognitive functions to get an accurate read on what type you are.  I've met a few ENFJs already and honestly a lot of NF types click with me very well.  I personally feel that as an ENFJ people sorta gravitate to me because I'm able to get them for who they are.  My friends tell me I am able to crack even the most reserved types of people and get them to open up fairly easily.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat makes ENFJs unique?  \n\n* We are easy to talk to\n* we can read people very well\n* we are super strong in empathy\n* We can generally do personality chameleon to fit whatever group we are hanging out with\n* We are thoughtful\n* We are straightforward\n* We can see bullshit from a mile away (the exception would be when we have rose colored glasses)\n* We are generally out making the world a better place\n\nAccept and love yourself.  Rock your flaws and your strengths.
10	I love being an ENFJ! I have superpowers of leading/guiding people and magic intuition about knowing the exact thing to say off the cuff. My husband is an INTP and he may have a cool data science job, but his people skills are rough. He's lost several job opportunities because he looks great on paper and flubs the interviews--whereas, I've gotten job offers for every interview I've ever been to (and because of this high success rate, I only apply to jobs I really like, saving me time and anguish). \n\nMy diplomacy is a hack that allows me to see the good in any person and mobilize people who seem to hate each other. Human emotions/interactions appear to me like the Matrix's code to Neo. When meetings are going nowhere, I energize them. Where people see problems, I point them to solutions. At my best, no one realizes I've changed the entire direction of the conversation.\n\nWe're literally one of the few types that make effective teachers and managers. Without us, the world would be running around working on the wrong problems, doing jobs ill-suited to their skills, and generally fucking things up. Every day, I go to sleep knowing I personally made the world a better place.\n\nWe're rare and special. Soak it up. And you're only a box if you let yourself be. Building healthy boundaries is the #1 skill ENFJs need to master.
8	I'm crushing so hard on an enfj girl right now, I love how easy she is to talk to, how myself I feel I can be, how honest I can talk without fearing of fucking it up, she is so selfless and the cutest little bubble of energy, I never thought I could find someone I could trust that much, love yourself, you are awesome, watch parks and recreations the main character Leslie is definitely an enfj and she is the absolute best, I wish I could meet more enfjs
6	INTP chiming in.\n\nY'all ENFJs are my absolute favorites.  I wish there were more of you!
6	The thing I struggle with the most is being so emotional. I feel like talking about ny emotions and other's emotions is draining, but I just HAVE TO. I also feel like it must irritate other people? Also, I sometimes wish I can feel nothing at all, but when I so I fewl lost. I also feel like when I talk about feelings with other people I am almost always disappointed in the answers I get, since it lacks tue depth I crave. I end up feeling alone as no one underatands what I mean. Especially the people I care about. 
9	ENFJs might not have any cool super powers like building a robot from scratch such as ISTP, but, our good judgment on people and situations can save us a lot of time from things that don’t deserve us. Also, all the ENFJs (literally 2, we are very rare) and myself are in very happy, and healthy marriages. We make it a point to obtain the good in all our relationships. Don’t be sad OP, be grateful! Being hypersensitive has its perks. And also it’s drawbacks, but that comes with any personality type. We are here for you. 
5	ENTJ here just popping in to say I have a vast appreciation of ENFJs, they’re great! There’s so much about ENFJs that are unique, I love how you all have the ability to bring people together and really make everyone feel important (because they are). You all are true team players and make good leaders and I’ve found that ENFJs make excellent teachers also. \n\nMy mother is an ENFJ, I wouldn’t be the person I am today without her. \n\nKeep being you, you’re great and we need people like you in the world. 
4	I identified with this. \n\nThen I remembered that ENFJs profiles were initially built by other types, and grew from what other people thought of us. What people think of us is not always correct, and misses out certain aspects of us a lot. \n\nJust because *we appear* to be constantly based around servitude, it doesn’t mean that *we are*. We are capable of living for ourselves and reaching for our needs too. I’m fed up with ENFJs on forums playing up the narrative that we must always have other people at centre-focus. That our super-powers are limited to ‘giving’  and ‘being thoughtful’, when in reality, how we use our FE can vary greatly. It’s important to know that we are should, and are capable of looking out for ourselves too.

1	it's hard to find time to connect with enfjs even after finding one 😅
1	Being able to make friends and understand what makes almost anyone tick sounds like a superpower to me, and would to most other "types". \n\nI get the flipside though - I am enjoying some important "me time" after weeks and weeks of friends taking me up on my perhaps-too-generous invitation to come visit. I must remember to balance "them time" with "me time" - otherwise you "give" until you've got nothing left...

7	What is your mbti and love style?	[How Your Childhood Affects Your Love Styles - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZj176ZoM4Y)
4	I'm an ENFJ and I grew up seeing my parents being fun and lovey dovey so that makes me hold priority for someone that's physically affectionate. I have experienced relationships in America, South Korea, and Philippines. So far Filipina women win it on affection
2	I’m an ENFJ and I’m big on quality time, affirmations because it makes me feel warm and fuzzy on the inside 🥰. And I love physical touch. 
1	ENFJ. #1 was physical touch and the rest (minus gifts) were all the same 🤷🏻‍♀️
1	ENFJ - #1 words of affirmation.  #2 physical touch.  #3 quality time.  #4 acts of service.  #5 gifts.

2	How do my fellow enfjs go about spotting other enfjs ?	I feel like because of how versatile enfjs are, it always hard to spot them. Ive mistaken quite a few enfps for enfjs and even some isfjs for enfjs. I was wondering how people go about spotting enfjs ? \n\n
2	I don’t know any ENFJs either
1	people aren't like pokemon where you get random encounters and identify their MBTI.  Especially so if you don't know how to type people (I know I can't xD).  My best friend is an ENFJ, and honestly I didn't know until he took the test and we looked into his cognative functions.  The defining difference between ENFPs and ENFJs is that ENFPs tend to look at possibilities and ENFJs are very decisive.  ISFJs I'm not too sure because I don't have any friends like that 
1	The only other ENFJ I know is my adult nephew. 
13	Do any ENFJs out there believe in astrology?	Why or why not?
8	enfj here.\n\nyes, i think i do.\n\ni'm at this really interesting part of my life right now, and lately i've really taken a deep interest in astrology - it's really quite fascinating. digging into it has been incredibly introspective for me and i strongly resonate with my full natal chart - it's MUCH more personal, relatable, and DEEP - so deep - than any "horoscope" i've ever read - which is what gives astrology a bad rep amongst most folk.\n\nsince i've taken an interest in astrology - much like mbti - i feel so in tune with myself, i can empathize and understand myself better, and so my inner work has been extremely intense and very progressive. that's been really important to me.\n\n\~ sun in leo, ascendant in capricorn, moon/mercury/venus in cancer.
10	Nope. Not me. \n\nFirst of all. Astrology was invented when people still believed the world was flat and the universe revolved around the earth. \n\nSecondly, I’m in charge of my own destiny. That’s been obvious to me from a very young age. \n\nThirdly. You can read those horoscopes and find a way to relate it to anyone. \n\nYou could say some of the same things about Briggs Meyer. But at least there’s some legitimate science and study to back all of it up. \n\n
3	No, because horoscopes are always vague and can be read in different ways. I have also seen sites recycle same stuff with other horoscopes. But formost, i would not let the mbti or astrology define me or my life in general because that is straight up nonsense
3	I do not. 
5	Hell yeah I do i do!! 
4	Astrology is BS lol
2	No I don’t play pretend
2	Yeah, it's real. Anyone who doesn't agree is just oriented differently which makes them incapable of understanding it on a realistic level, and probably has not done in depth research before writing it off as bullshit; which is fine, because not everything is for everyone, and basically no one has to accept each other's ideas, but saying something is untrue without in depth study is most likely just ignorant, because most concepts simply have a different way of application which just aren't useful and practical to everyone, such as mathematics and science aren't useful to everyone in their day to day lives, but you don't see me saying those things are completely false -- just not useful for me, which makes it easy to think anyone who wastes their time on such things is a narrow minded fool, among other things, but for them it's just as real and useful as what the next guy thinks. So there is no argument. People should simply let others be without expecting others to conform to their beliefs. Unfortunately most people who don't want to let others be are the ones who aren't open minded to other people's ideas, and think they are correct, which makes the world not a nice place. Honestly everyone should leave each other be and go their own ways, instead of trying to get the world to conform to their beliefs, as if they are the center of the universe, and think they can be correct as a spec of dust in an infinite universe, where most likely other more intelligent life doesn't know or care if that spec of dust even exists or not.  
1	Funny I found this post:\nI am an ENFJ and can totally relate to this personality type. In high school, I was obsessed with astrology and would learn how for was a birth chart and understand the meaning of all the different planets and houses. I was so obsessed that I became the astrologer of my class, whether people believe it or not, I was pretty accurate with my readings. Even my philosophy teacher told me her sun sign ahah\nNowadays, I'm not as obsessed as my INTJ boyfriend finds it quite weird, so I keep it to myself and enjoy it sometimes (it's not a surprise to me that an INJT would not like astrology, it's a pseudo science so nothing logical and scientific to them ahah)\nBut yes, astrology has always been a big passion in my life, as well as hand reading.
31	ENFJ to do list:	‪- vacuum‬\n‪- dishes‬\n‪- remind all ur friends that they’re the best thing to happen to the universe‬\n‪- homework‬
13	I have a daily list of obligations that goes like: \n\nschool\n\nwork \n\ncoffee with a friend who's going through a breakup \n\nhomework\n\ngroceries\n\nmoral support for my roommate \n\n&#x200B;\n\nit's just us ENFJ's ;) \n\n&#x200B;
8	It be like that
3	My actual today list? :P  \n\nDone:  \n-Work, and everything it involves  \n-Check on a friend for news on a new job  \n-Walk with a friend from work on my way home  \n-Send a sunshine message to another friend  \n-Answer in my family group chat  \n-Answer in my sisters group chat  \n-Answer someone for a project we are working on  \n-Go get and try on my new headphones!!  \n-Pet the cats  \n-Send picture of headphones to get news from yet another friend  \n\nNot yet done:  \n-Say hi to my best friend  \n-Tell the friend who told me about the headphones that I received them  \n-Eat  \n-Say welcome to like 10 people to yet another group chat  \n-Relax  \n\nHow did I ever think I was an introvert is beyond me.
3	-Take care of self\n\n-Learn to not worry so much\n\nSo many times I wish my ENFJ wasn't hurt by her own need to care about so many things. 
2	Damn that’s really my life lmao
2	Lemon Water-Coffee-Tea; Sandwich; Work (Get random girl from the bar last night a job; start negotiations between current boss and the client who originally hired me); offer to cover for someone tomorrow; eat eggs; skip another bar with other friends tonight; grocery shop; bomb-ass pasta; weed, lemon water. \n\nTomorrow: make sure no one throws food in the dirty laundry, like last time. 
8	fellow ENFJs in relationships: who said "I love you" first?	just trying to get some perspective from this community. I'm a female ENFJ, he is ENFP. we're going on 8 months strong. \n\nsome background: my first long-term relationship was with an ESTJ. he said he loved me about 5 or 6 months into the relationship.  next long-term was also ENFP. he told me he loved me about 7 months into the relationship. \n\nnow with my current guy, and I know I love him. but I can't say it to him! he is the kindest, most giving person I've ever met. we took a 2-week vacation over the Christmas break and I was scared that I'd scare him with the little things... but he's been so patient with me. I know that the more I spend time with him, my feelings for him just get stronger. but I don't know why I just can't say it. every time I think about it, I get flustered. fear of rejection maybe? it's like I'm too shy to say it, which is the opposite of what ENFJs usually are known for (being upfront). he hasn't said it to me, and that's ok. I can wait. but there's this inner voice in my head that keeps nagging me to just say it, and my mouth won't cooperate. \n\nanyone else (particularly female) going thru this? any advice?
2	This has not been my experience, but I think I know why. I asked my husband out, said I love you first, and asked my husband to marry me. \nHowever, I have bipolar disorder and when i met him I was on the manic end, which means increase confidence and decreased inhibition. If I had been depressed or stable at the time I never ever would have. Sorry I cant be more helpful. 
1	I am going through the EXACT SAME THING with my ISTP boyfriend. I'm trying not to rush anything and I have to keep holding it in because I don't want to scare him! I hate this feeling 😞
1	i said i love you first. :3 now he's my fiance
1	My boyfriend was the first to say I love you. I’ll be honest he said it quite quickly and since it was my first relationship I was hesitant to say it back I guess at the time I was unsure about the relationship and didn’t feel the same way so it took me a while to say it back. 
1	Okay, can I just say that when I dated my ex.. she said that she loved me first. But when we broke up, she accused me of saying it first and told me she wasn’t interested in me to begin with xD is this a pride thing? Or was she telling the truth now that we were broken up
2	Hello Enfjs	Hello Enfjs,\n\nIf you wanna chat with ENTP guy, send me a private message :).\n\nNever have been chatted with ENFJ so suprise me :D\n\nWaiting for ya!\n\n&#x200B;
15	Does anyone else feel just emotionally hurt for no reason?	I've skirted with symptoms of anxiety and depression for a few years. It hasn't been nearly as severe lately, but I've  just been feeling like something will hurt me, emotionally, and I'll carry it around for the rest of the day. \n\nIt's like my skin feels extra sensitive, my chest feels tight, and it's harder to breathe throughout the day.   \n\n\nSometimes, I'll feel like I'm on the verge of shaking/crying all the time.   \nI have no idea if it's an anxiety thing, or an ENFJ thing. Feeling kind of sad and oversensitive.   \n\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? If so, how do you get over it?
5	I think every emotionally charged person feels this way sometimes. I have had more than my share of days like this. I can remember this happening all the way back in grade school. I would just have days that I cried. I still do. Unfortunately, I can't make tears and that makes it feel like it is much worse. Hang in there. You already know that you get through these days. The joy returns. 
8	I feel this way sometimes when I see that whatever I have done for someone wasn’t appreciated. It makes me feel worthless and unappreciated. But then I just remind myself that a true giver doesn’t expect anything back from others, and the ones that do are merely “traders”. It allows you to care about others in a healthier way. Not saying your situation involves people, this is just my experience.\nI would love to see if I can help more and ask if anything specific is causing you this?
2	In my experience, this only happens with people or when someone tells me that my dreams are "impossible" to achieve and I like a good challenge.\n\nI have felt this way with my introverted feelings only whenever I have done something for someone that is well appreciated, but doesn't feel natural to another person. For me whenever my random acts of kindness, dedication, or time is taken for someone is taken for granted as weakness, I sometimes carry that on for a very long time and don't realize why I'm upset. I know that it's mostly an ENFJ thing when you do something that's so tailored to a person, and sometimes that perceived as in-genuine "chaotic good" behavior and feels weird or our of the ordinary to another person, so there is appreciation but no sense of gratitude.\n\nFreedom to explore, have positive or constructive conversations, doing things you love, staying curious to learn new things from others around you, helping people grow, and no matter what be the best and most honest version of yourself to the fullest. The way to calm more intrusive thoughts and care about people while taking care of yourself.\n\nFor me the statement, "the joy ENFJs take in moving things forward means that there is always a sense of purpose behind their friendships, creating bonds that are not easily shaken" is one I highly resonate with and "at the heart of it, ENFJs need to see how the story ends, to feel and experience the gratitude and appreciation of the people they’ve helped in order to be happy."\n\nThis is just my experience so far in life.
2	The timing that you posted this is perfect because I have been feeling this way a lot recently. I also dance with depression and anxiety and have very intensely for the past several years. I know part of it is my day to day situation that I am stuck in for the time being... but it has definitely left me having days where, for lack of a better explanation, I feel sensitive to the point of feeling almost as if my "emotional skin" is utterly removed and I feel very... raw. I dont know how else to describe it but it gets to the point where I feel like I cant be around anyone for fear that I will get hurt. Most days, I can power through difficult situations, mean people and just general stress. But on days when I feel this raw feeling, I just absolutely cant handle anything and I feel very anxious and depressed. These days arent totally random and usually come from a build up of situations that I feel very helpless and open to attacks in but man are they difficult to power through with my normal level of intensity.
0	I do but I know the reasons. 
5	What are you grateful for today?	Hey ENFJs and everyone else! What are you grateful for today?\n\nIs it an accomplishment? Something that made you happy? Something meaningful?\n\nLet's make the world a little brighter together!
7	I am grateful that I am alive and that I can keep trying. 
3	I'm grateful for good mentors, a loving family, and kick-ass friends.
3	That I met my lost love. Miss her every day but couldn’t be happier that we shared what we did. \nLong night tonight..
1	Waking up to my dog. She’s getting old and having her around is great 
15	Trouble sticking to a career path	Hello fellow ENFJs! I tend to hype myself up and talk myself into different career paths and changing jobs every year. I change hobbies every couple months. As far as goals, I can make and stick to them, but the path is always winding (E.g. weight loss- I've tried several different methods over the past year, and I'm down 30lbs) Does anyone else struggle with this?? How do I combat this professionally? I'm thinking some role where there are new problems to solve and frequent change of scenery and a team to lead. This month, I want to be a training manger in a growing company. It FEELS like a great fit, but so did all the other ones. Any ideas?
7	Personnaly I always need change. Repetition gets boring. Either find a job that offers that or change every few years. I see no problem with changing once in a while if your life situation allows that. 
3	I’m the same way, and I’ve been told to be a professor at a university. Variety of classes in your discipline & you can research whatever you are more interested in at the moment. I’m looking to jump back into wilderness therapy because it’s so diverse, lots of different elements of the outdoors & the human mind at play
2	I joined this sub because im very unhappy with my career choice and need some help finding a new reasonable one. 
2	For sure. I always *feel* like one career is my calling and when I research more about it or actually get onto the academic side to learn about it, I tend to get discouraged. It feels like all my decisions are based on what sounds good and I have an idealized image of it in my mind.\n\nI was in a competitive medical program in my undergrad for over 2 years and by the end of the semester when stuff got real, I did not do well at all. It was all too much to handle and I thought having the ambition to help people would be enough for me but it wasn’t. Since the end of this past summer, I switched into business because I wanted to capitalize on my skills as a strong communicator and thought the field is broad and very much in demand.\n\nI have a focus in marketing and I was interested in advertising and designing those high quality Super Bowl commercials and the whole nine yards. I want to be in market strategy and see it as a way for me to be creative and utilize my communication to be a leader. A couple days ago my mom responded saying “ok that’s good but you don’t know what market strategy is”. I was ready to respond but nothing came out, because she was right. \n\nI started an internship on Wall Street a couple weeks ago and was super pumped but now I’m already over it. Still trying to figure out this all myself and find my true calling
1	The longest I have stayed at a full time job is 2.5 years, and it was Help Desk. Because of that, every day was a bit different, if somewhat repetitive after a while. My current job/company makes it so every day is different enough that it keeps me on my feet.\n\nAs for hobbies, it's usually cycles. I go crazy into one, drop it for a few months, go back, drop it again... and that counts for shows/books/games/creative things...\n\nI'd say working in a startup or for a smaller, newer (less than 15 yo) company has better chances of keeping you in a position where things change often and quickly. Big corporate offices usually have defined systems and any change takes a while to get implemented. But it can mean giving up security and a sense of calm in the office.\n\nPersonally, I find a "human, ever changing" environment more rewarding. 
1	Actually, I can't relate. My interests have always been fairly consistent (writing, English lit) and when I discovered I loved teaching, I never looked back. It's been 8 years since I began and I don't think I'll do anything else, ever.\n\nThat being said, I enjoy variety inside my job. I'm always challenging myself to teach a new topic, develop a new activity, etc. Recently I've taken on more administrative duties and I enjoy the new challenge. \n\nMaybe you just haven't found your calling yet?
9	Dealing with our introverted intuition and feelings	[ENFJ TIPS: How to Cheer Yourself Up](https://www.youtube.com/attribution_link?a=AQOALYLH340&u=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D_1T6y8eWuf8%26feature%3Dshare)\n\nI came across this and really liked the advice
3	It describes it really well!\n\nInterestingly, I always thought I was weird for not being able to describe how I felt. It took 28 years before I was able to say "I am angry at myself, and I feel shame and sadness" or even "happiness feels warm in my chest".\n\nI like the difference between Ti and Fi as described in the video. I'll try and take it into account when choosing what skill to use.
1	Love her ❤️
16	Reaction to constant stress	I've been studying my past behaviours and my reaction to stress much more lately, and I realize I can almost predict what will happen in advance now (and sometimes prevent it).\n\nThat's my usual timeline with being constantly stressed:\n\nAt the first sign of stress, I get incredibly anxious. I start doubting myself so I'll look around and talk it out with people. I'll also use coping strategies very easily.\n\nIf the stressers stay or new ones come, I'll start feeling the need to fix things. I'll throw myself deep into "improvement" projects, the more people positively affected, the better it is. I'll almost forget about me, and will think about how things should be better for everyone. I'll start complaining more openly about general issues. I keep on using coping strategies, but it will be harder, since all my time is spent trying to *fix/improve* things.\n\nIf I fail at improving things to a point that satisfies me, which is the case 99% of the time, I'll start getting physically ill. My mental health will be deteriorating but I'll refuse to acknowledge it. I'll start complaining to whomever is listening, but I'll never feel they understand. I'll start acting both very outgoing and retreating in fear, like I can't make up my mind. Coping strategies will become hard to implement.\n\nWhen I become incredibly critical or judgmental of others, I know I'm hitting dangerous territory. I'll be making snap judgments, and then feel shame and guilt, but I can't help it. I will try to protect others from myself as much as I can, and I'll voice that I am unwell so I can get help. And I usually get help at this part, not because I'm afraid for me, but because I don't like how I act towards others.\n\nAnd then, I start isolating. If someone asks me how I am doing, or points out that I look tired, I'll use very short sentences, and gloss over it. Getting out of there requires incredible willpower, and outside help. Unfortunately, that's usually when people realize I look unwell, so in their heads, I'm still early on in my stress response.\n\nTL;DR\n\nI'll start by using a lot of adjectives and long sentences to describe my stress, but ultimately put it aside to help you. The shorter my sentences and the more critical I am of others and myself, the more stressed I am. When I start isolating and distrusting people to the point of barely opening up about my state, I'm in a bad place.\n\nNo matter where I am in the whole process, I'll still smile and laugh, which is both a blessing and a curse.\n\nI'm currently standing very close to the "bad place", but being aware of it helps.\n\nWhat does your stress timeline look like? How do you let people know where you are standing?
5	If I’m very quiet and moving my eyes from places to place, I’m stressed. I sigh deeply and will around, trying to piece my thoughts together in order to come with a plan to combat whatever’s bothering me. \n\nIf I speak in my stress, I’ll speak with very few words like you. With my brain moving quickly, I can’t speak and problem solve at the same time. I have to have a plan of action and then only can I speak normally. This stress originated from things I don’t see coming, usually things academic oriented
2	I relate to this timeline very much. I have been in a very weird situation that has locked me into a place in my life where I have remained in the last stage for several years. I no longer have any energy to go out and be around others in situations other than what is demanded of me. I have become intensely introverted in a place of utter protection from the outside. I am excited to be out of this once again and go back to enjoying life and wanting to be around people. Currently, I will frequently oscillate between fixing broken situations and giving up. A lot of my stress has come from remaining in very, very broken situations that I have had to stay in for several years now. It is starting to come to an end now but it has definitely given me a new perspective on coping and functioning in that last stage... \n\nI also very much related to the gift/curse of being able to laugh and smile through it all. Part of my isolation is how, due to my incredible facade, no one truly knows or understands what I am emotionally going through so I have shut myself off from truly opening up around people. Not a great place to be but there really hasnt been another option. In the past, situations like these have generally hospitalized me. As I've grown and learned how to handle them better, I've avoided the hospital more and more. Never be afraid to take a massive step back and do what makes you happy for a bit. Your gut may tell you otherwise, but you need to put yourself first because generally, no one else will (unless you run into another ENFJ hahaha). Glad you shared this. 
1	The best way to cope with stress myself is to take a deep breath. By that I mean do something you love to do or be with friends and do something fun if you can. Just take a day off and gather yourself if you can. However do not be alone if you are depressed in anyway emotions control us and we can fall into a never ending cycle of beating ourselves up because we internalize our thoughts. Life is a bitch and it’s not always easy so perspective always helped me. For example there are kids starving in Africa in war torn communities. Or North Koreans that have no freedom. Knowing that I’m not the worst one off helps me to reflect if I get knocked off my feet and it helps me realize the things I do have. Hope that things start turning your way!
21	Do you feel like you are there for your friends all the time, but when you need them, they are not there?	Hello fellow ENFJ people. Do you feel like sometimes your friends just don't give a f about you and what is happening in your life?\n\nI recently lost a parent after very tough battle and  I tried to be strong and not let anyone see I am actually a huge mess.\nMy friends were there, sure, they came to the funeral but after few weeks no one even bothered to ask me how am I doing.\n\nNow after few months one friend feels free to call me at 2am to tell me how she almost had a sex with some guy, other one is crying because she can't decide which guy to choose from the 3 they are after her. The other one wants me to go shopping with her because she is moving in with a boyfriend and one of my best guy friends is complaining why he can't study and pass exams because he is still sad since his girlfriend left him 2 years ago.\n\nI love my friends and I am always there for them. I am happy they have happy/interesting life and I want them to be happy, always. \nBut not one of them asked me since all of that happened do I need help, if I want to talk. \nSome of them even say oh I don't want to ask you anything it must be hard. And I just stand there and am like it is hard.\n\nI know it's a hard topic to talk about but recently I feel like they feel free to ask for my help when they need it but never ask me if I need them or their help. Or maybe just to understand that now, maybe I don't want to cheer them up every day. I need them to cheer me up.\n\nIs this normal for our type or is it just my personal problem? 
11	Yes. All the time. I've been thinking a lot about this phenomenon. I think it's part of the curse of being mostly stable. I've been having a really rough time lately, but when I try to talk to my friends about my troubles, I get something along the lines of, "If anyone can handle this, you can."\n\n\n\nThey are used to us being OK.  And maybe it causes too much cognitive dissonance for them to entertain the idea that we are not.  Or maybe they just don't understand how dire it gets for us. \n\nI'm not sure which, but I don't think it's lack of care or love for us. It's just that they don't know what to do when the caretaker needs care. 
3	Not sure if this’ll help, but look at how things usually are. Humans are creatures of habit and therefore (mostly) enjoy it when things are normal. Look at how (for the lack of a better word) messed up you are when one thing happens to you vs. the same happening to them. Look at how you’ve put yourself out there, in relation to how put together, emotional, or how fixated on your loss you’re letting your friends pick up on. Also pay attention to just how well they pick up on things like that.\nLastly, you have my condolences, fellow Redditor. Time really is one of the best ways to stop thinking about losses, it will get good :)
3	Yep definitely. I have 2 friends that I can say I 100% can count on no matter what. I'm trying hard to make more (because of those 2 peoplebut1 is extremely busy with her hands always full but still tries and the other is 3500 miles and 2 timezones away) but so far not much luck. One I thought was going to be great but ends up she mostly contacts me either in crisis mode (men problems) or when she needs to borrow $$ 😑. People are selfish AF sometimes and I honestly find it disheartening.\n\nI wish I had some advice. All I can say is you're not alone. I get tired of always being the go-to person and not having much in return. We aren't giving people because we expect something in return but FFS it'd be nice sometimes!! I'm so sorry for your loss. That absolutely sucks. What about maybe seeing a grief counselor for a little while? Might be nice to have some real support. *Hugs*
2	Yeah pretty much, but i do not want to burden them with my problems anyway so i prefer to suffer alone. Given the fact that they are you friends then i would consider telling them how you feel, i am sure that they would understand, and if they do not understand then you know where you stand in their world.
2	I think the comments above are accurate.  Also wanted to say:  Dude, how ARE you feeling at the moment? Please vent to us if it can be any help to you. You need to off load the grief somewhere, and we are here for you if you need. Xx
1	YEAH.
1	Mine are there for me but in their own way, not in the way I am for them. So it feels lesser but it isn’t. Wishing people to go above and beyond for you is normal but everyone can only do what they’re able. We’re just very much willing and able types to go crazy above
3	Engaged to an ISTP	First of all, WHAT IN THE ACTUAL F**CK have I gotten myself into. It seems like we are the complete opposite. ENFJ are so nurturing and it seems ISTP are just like “meh” lol. I love him and I know he loves me. We’ve had the talk about being sure we’re ready for marriage but at times it seems like I want him to be so happy that at times I outweigh what I can do without. Sometimes he’s quick to make a decision without me yet want to be so affectionate and silly, laughing and all. Those times that make me crazy are when he expresses his feelings, as an ENFJ (ignore that I’m a woman for right now), I support him, give suggestions, he’s always so grateful but then when I need to express myself it seems like I’m being needy or that he “doesn’t know what I want from him”. He supports me vice versa financially, mentally, emotionally but it just seems like we disconnect somewhere. I find myself wanting to make him happy and wanting to be his best friend as well as his life partner as we have both voiced but how can we do this when every blue moon we have this argument that he sees one way (but I see too) and I see something one way (but he can’t see it). I get the logic thinker part is the biggest thing about an ISTP but how are we supposed to build a marriage on this when I feel like I’m too clingy and he’s not enough clingy or considerate to my feelings when it counts the most!?
3	First of all... Breathe.\n\nYou need to understand that there are pros and cons to dating any type! Not everyone can be ENFJ. Not everyone understands emotions as naturally as you do.\n\nI have an INTP best friend (also Ti dominant), and he also only responds to logic. The emotions are processed in isolation, and in short bursts. But you CAN convince them to communicate better, you just need to phrase it in a what that "makes sense" or brings some sort of benefit.\n\nWhatever you do - DO NOT INDULGE IN DUMPING\n\nIf you need help (or his opinion) on a problem, SUMMARISE the situation as much as possible. Forgo the details (ISTP can connect the dots quite well, and are bored by details).\n\nISTPs are not emotional cushions (men in general are not this way, especially if introverted), so a good investment is to spend regular time with a female friend who is an "extroverted" type, maybe once a week.\n\nIf all else fails, yo "can" decide to find another man... But remember that QUALITY men are in general very difficult to find, let alone pin down. Only do this if you are absolutely sure that your man lacks quality!\n\n~IS"F"P, dating an ENFJ\n\nPS: if you are getting married, you might want to subscribe to r/redpillwomen\n\n
3	every ISTP I know and met so far 😞. be patient. not everyone understands emotions the same way. don't ever derail what you value and start with the things you share.
2	I’m dating and ISTJ and I feel the SAME WAY like we are two Opposite and sometimes that clashes hard \nEdit: we are also engaged and I struggle so much with communication 
2	Look up istp /enfj on reddit. There are tons of great posts and comments. \n\nEg. https://www.reddit.com/r/enfj/comments/9zurpm/enfjistp_relationship_advice/?st=JRQYQHQG&sh=434534b4
1	That's because you pretty much are the complete opposite. Mbti doesn't think it's wise to marry your dual, although socionics does. Well maybe not marry, but your dual is there for your growth, and to take away insecurities by experiencing each other and getting comfortable. It's supposed to be a hard relationship for personal growth. It's wise to be with an INFP or ENFP, as an ENFJ, if you want to get married, or just have a good relationship in general. \n\nThis video might be helpful:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/yEh3HY5YNx4
1	I’m an ENFJ and my boyfriend is an ISTP so I feel your struggle. We’ve been together for almost 8 years and fully intend on getting married but I understand that struggle of feeling like I do so much for him (by choice) and need his attention a lot when he is perfectly content to just do his own thing. It took awhile for me to not take it personally and just recognize that we need different things out of the relationship.
55	Based on what I've learned about y'all, this seemed accurate.	
6	Hi! Ive never met someone who I know is definitely an ENFJ, but ive heard you guys are sort of awesome. Anyone want to talk? ENFP here:)	Just an American ENFP guy...I truly have no idea what y'all are like but I want to!
3	Well we sure are. And so are ENFPs! Humans are absolutely fascinating.\n\nI had a conversation with my boss the other day. He was saying how everyone in the team is just so different on so many levels, and how the person I want to bring in is also completely different.\n\nWe exchanged a silly, happy smile. My boss and I get along well.\n\n*People*, love them, hate them. Mostly love them.\n\nIf you had to invent a best friend on the spot and do an activity of your choice with them, what would it be, and why?
2	Oh hey! How's it going? Been to the states a few times and you guys are hella friendly. Where you from? 
1	Hello my dude, what's up?
1	Hey buddy! Chiming in from the great white north...huddled inside lol
1	Well, we ARE pretty cool. ;) 
1	What are your goals and fears? 
12	Crushing on enfj girl	Hey guys enfp male here, I just went to have some coffee with and enfj girl and I had such a great time! She couldn't stop playing around with her coffee cup and she asked lots of fun questions like when do I wanna marry and stuff, I think we have a good vibe going and I'm looking forward to going out as a date with her next time! \n\n So yeah guys, any tips and any warnings, also any enfp traits that I should be careful about?\nLove yall
6	My ex was an ENFP. I found that sometimes he didn't stick to his word/wasn't focussed enough and was easily distracted in the relationship. We also were totally conflict adverse and when we argued it  was very  emotional. I  enjoyed the boundless cute affection and warmth though. 
3	I'll just leave this here.  [ENFJs and Relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/enfj/comments/9le99s/ama_enfjs_and_relationships/)
3	My SO (f) is an ENFP and I (m) am ENFJ. The biggest problems we face are really when I try to avoid conflict and/or judge myself, but those aren't big problems in general since I knew that from before and we both have learned how to deal with it when it happens. We have been together for more than three years and I have never been happier.  As long as you're both having fund and are always open and honest to each other I think you have nothing to worry about. If it fits it will be wonderful, if it doesn't it wasn't meant to be. Good luck and have fun! 
2	Just be yourself, don’t try to change yourself. Be open just do what you were doing.

36	I’m “TOO Positive”	Do your friends ever get mad or annoyed at you for being “too positive” like I see myself as an extremely negative person who’s tryna get out of a depressing hole of anxiety and yet I’m still called out for this... Anyone relate or am I just weird...  Edit: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR BEAUTIFUL UPLIFTING REPLIES <33 
22	"I am too much for some people. They are not my people." \n\nFriend...you're the only one who has to look you in the mirror. Be enough - be the best - for you. 
11	You aren’t alone. Some friends have gotten mad because when they come to me and I give “too much advice and am too positive” and they just would like to sulk in the negative. Honestly it’s a blessing and a curse. Our ability to empathize with people is above all others- but it can get messy sometimes. 
10	People tell me it’s not posible or I must be lying or faking my energy. Haha fuck them maybe some day they’ll learn how to flow with what ever and accept what’s real as it is now and enjoy it fully as it comes!! I can relate to being in very depressed times through out my life as well so it’s funny when people tell me I am a ray of sunshine or some corny shit
6	Yep. Been told that all my life. Too happy. Too positive. Too this, too that.  You know what? Fuck that shit. We are AWESOME. I would much rather be around someone like us, than someone who is extremely negative or unhappy. I’m sure a lot of us are also very empathetic and try to help people who are down. It’s just who we are. \n\nChin up. Wear your HAPPY with Pride!!  We’ve got you!\n💗
4	Mhm I think that's what makes you an unstoppable force ;p\nI've had people tell me I'm not even positive anymore, that I'm at the point of being naïve. But hey, I know what's going on, I really do, but what's the point of sulking about it? I'd rather tell myself, "there has to be a way!" \nSomeone's going to really like that about you, you'll find them one day :)
3	I have been told the same thing by coworkers and friends. Little do they know, day to day I'm actually a pessimist and quite negative. That being said, I don't want to bring others down and my need for everyone to be happy is more important to me, so when I'm around others apart from my SO I smile and joke around. The world can be a depressing place sometimes, sue us for trying to make it a tiny bit brighter. 
3	My friends don’t get mad at me for being too positive but it is a descriptor they use for me. I would say I’m a negative person because I am always in my head and worrying, and anticipating the worst. But when I say that about myself they are surprised and say I am one of the most positive people they know. I find it confusing (and interesting) that how I think I come across to people isn’t how they see me at all.
2	Actually had a pretty rough relationship a few years back that left me feeling like an idiot for having a positive outlook on things. It made me look naive in my friend's eyes, and so for a long time I tried very hard to be more "realistic" so as not to annoy this friend. It turned me skeptical of people having good intentions and good things happening for a long time... Not a good place for an ENFJ. \n\nBut I learned after that: if someone thinks you're naive/annoying for being positive, they can deal with that. Life is too short to be anything but positive, and there are so many more people who are gonna love you for the joy you bring into their day.\n
2	friend.. u are too positive. that makes you irrational. first of all, u need to be a good listener, meaning, shut up a lot , ask questions, DONT OFFER PErspective. 7cups has good tutorials
3	I've often looked at the world with rose-colored glasses. Over the past ten years, I've tempered it, becoming more "T" than "F"
1	Omg I get this soooo much, my best friend says that!!!
9	Should I go for it?	I (26) met this man (27) that I truly love. We've been dating for 1.5 years and have not yet had sex. He has a great amount of patience. He says that he is perfectly ok with it and is willing to wait as long as necessary until I am ready. I know this abnormal in these times but I am appreciative of the respect he has shown for me and my decisions. I worry that he does crave it more than he shares. We foreplay ( a lot!) in other ways.\n\nFor me personally, since sex is such an intimate experience, I would like to have it only with "the one" I am wishing to marry one day. I don't like the idea of having that sexual history tainted by someone else if it does not work out. There are certain "firsts" that I don't believe you can get back or relive/ experience in the same way. It won't be the end of the world but something I want to make 100% sure it's the right moment with the right person so I do not live with regrets. At one point, I wanted to wait until engagement to have sex because at that point we are both committed to marriage and to each other. However, recently I've been thinking that I love this man and want to have sex with him in the upcoming week. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you all of reddit think? Should I let go of my previous held beliefs and values and just go for it in love and passion? Is my boyfriend an anomaly for waiting this long? Would you have put up with this? What have been your experiences?\n\nThanks all
9	Have you guys talked about getting married ? If so, why not wait until then ? I feel like it would make all the waiting even more worth it. That's just the way I see it, I may be wrong. Maybe you should talk about your future more if you haven't already. \n\n
3	Also, he is ENFJ
3	I waited til 2017 when I was 28 to have sex for the first time ever with whom I thought I’d be marrying. \nShe is “the one”, a soulmate, unfortunately marriage won’t be happening. But, I do not regret sex. I am happy when I look back at it. I waited all these years, finally emotionally and mentally grew, and picked this person.\n\nMight be different for you personally, and as a woman. Want a future, but always be prepared for it all to crash. Will you regret it then do you think? \nWould you tell the next boyfriend you love(hypothetical) that you have had sex, with a smile or somewhat scared/regretful?\n\nAlso, afterwards, even tho it is meaningful and intimate with whomever you wish it to be that way with, it is just sex. It does become less impactful to think about after the initial.\n\nI am the same as you. Always wanted to first wait til marriage, til adulthood, then engagement, then finally with her and after growing enough I decided that she is the one. \n\nAnd of course he craves it. Everyone naturally does. 
4	I personally think you should go for it.  Mostly because waiting until marriage for sex isn't really sustainable (in my opinion).  Like marriages do not really lock down the partner and people do divorce (there's a decent divorce rate of 30%) .  Sex doesn't have to be like an instant gratificaiton, and it can be intimate between more than one partner in a lifetime.  If you love the guy, ya'll can engage in loving passionate sex.  It means something though for him to wait this long without sex, as it shows he cares about you for you and isn't looking for anything casual.  The idea of having a sexual history being tainted by someone else isn't something I agree with as it's a normal part of life.  It builds experience and you learn about your own body and the body of guys.  I've had some friends who had never had sex before, found disappointment in the guy because he never had any experience with sex.  Same can be said vice versa, but this is easily resolved in communication with one another.  The idea of "tainted" makes it sound like you can't make any mistakes ever.  But we are all human and we fall down, do things we regret, and we learn from it.  Who's to say 10 years down the line in your marriage you guys won't feel the same anymore?  Then would you find regret loving someone for that period of time and then having sex with them?  I'd rather just enjoy the time I have with said person, and not regret being with them if things don't work out.  Nothing in this world is 100% or forever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain all of this is my own personal beliefs.  It could also be argued that doing this is because of one's integrity and it's something you should be proud of.  
2	As a fellow ENFJ, I totally get your point of view and I wouldn't worry if there's anything wrong with your SO. He simply loves you and is respectful of your values and convictions. 
2	That is a lot of pressure to put on the first sexytime. Honestly — the first time won’t be good, and the sex you have won’t be good until you practice by getting to know each others bodies. Love your sexuality, celebrate it, study it. It’s only yours, and will remain yours after you’ve had sex with someone else too. There is nothing that is lost. Only experiences won. The sooner you start, the sooner you will discover your own sexuality. Go explore! 
1	> For me personally, since sex is such an intimate experience, I would  like to have it only with "the one" I am wishing to marry one day. I  don't like the idea of having that sexual history tainted by someone  else if it does not work out.

It won't  be the end of the world but something I want to make 100% sure it's the  right moment with the right person so I do not live with regrets. \n\nI'm male, 21, and my attitude is exactly the same. Sex can be so much more than just positive stimuli, satisfaction of drives + instincts and release of binding hormones. I truly believe that you heavily risk loosing a potential depth by having sex (especially the first time) with the wrong person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA positive of being an INFP is that I normally know within hours of communication if the person has the potential to be by my side forever and if she is also able to reach the mental depth and strength of the bond I crave. I also have a talent spotting a specific type of ENFPs in public (Fi subtypes who often happen to mistype themselves as INFPs), and also felt romantic attraction only to those yet. I actually hate it when I openly talk about such things without having any empirical evidence. It's probably like someone talking about how he met a ghost.\n\nNevertheless, due to this I personally don't mind having sex early on, though I'm a virgin for already 21 years now so why should I suddenly feel the pressure to have sex. I'm also kinda confused by the people crying over how they haven't had a relationship or sex in 1-2 years...Like, why is your mental state so dependant on your animalistic drives? I honestly don't think that's a healthy way to deal with yourself. It quite reminds me a bit of a drug addict who has withdrawel symptoms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you really plan to wait for sex I would wait at least of 2 years. That's generally when the honeymoon phase is over and people start showing their bad sides over time and the "true" love is no more at risk being shrouded by the initial, neurochemically manipulating love.
0	Trust me when I say this is something you will always remember and like you said it is not something you will ever be able to get back. I was a virgin when I married at 24. I have no regrets. My marriage didn't last and I had two women I had sex within the seven years of being divorced. Believe me when I say I can remember sex with them and that has been more than 18 years ago. I would wait again. It was worth it. 
7	Confused ENFJ. Or maybe ESFJ :D	I have tested myself mainly on 16personalities and I notice that I fluctuate between ENFJ and ESFJ. I do not understand why, but both ESFJ & ENFJ look a bit similar to me. Am I right thinking that I get different results because of how I am feeling at the moment when taking a test? For example, If I was surrounded by people for few hours and do a test I get different results as when testing just after waking up in the morning?\n\nENFJ describes me 100% and I don't feel like ESFJ is my personality just because ESFJ tend to care what others think about them when in reality I don't give a flying F\*\*\* about what others think. Ofcourse I enjoy being liked by others and being popular but that's not my goal. \n\nMost enjoyable thing for me is making others do things they never believed they could. \n\nSo couple questions I got. \n\nWhat is the best way of checking your personality? Monthly tests? Maybe some other tests I have never heard before?\n\nCould I be in the middle of ENFJ & ESFJ? Or what is the explanation of me getting different personality types?  \n\nIs there anyone else like me that move between ENFJ and ESFJ? 
3	I don't know, personally my issue is that I care a little too much about how my actions affect others, so I do give a damn about what others think on some aspects. \nTry retaking the test after some time has passed, maybe you'll have clearer answers to some questions afterwards.
2	I'll say you're ENFJ, from\n\n> Most enjoyable thing for me is making others do things they never believed they could. \n\nThis is how I feel, and I'm ENFJ through and through. I don't think that this is an ESFJ's thing.\n\n\n\n
2	Leslie Knope is an ESFJ caricature. :) She wants to help others but also wants to do what she thinks is right, even when others may not know what’s ‘best’ for them. Extreme ENFJs, on the other hand, tend to get so much in other people’s feelings that every choice that feels right for others feels right in the moment. 
1	I recommend taking a MBTI function test, instead. 16personalities is kinda pop culturey, and, although a great point of entry to MBTI, should be taken with a grain of salt if you’re wanting to pursue your MBTI personality long-term and seriously. Also, ESFJ and ENFJ are very different in my book. Outgoing, organized, empathetic, sure, but that second letter makes a world of difference man. I’ll refrain from telling you why here so you don’t subconsciously test in favor of the one that sounds most appealing to you after you read this :P Just look up Jungian cognitive functions test on google after you read this and dive right in.
1	1. Are you a detail-oriented person (Si ESFJ)?\n2. Are you a risk taker (Se ENFJ) or a risk-averse (Si ESFJ)?\n\nThis should clears up
14	Are ENFJs most likely the first ones to make a move on someone their attracted to?	
7	I think this depends more on a person to person basis, but personally if I am seriously attracted to someone I NEVER make the first move, if they talk to me I'll carry on from there and befriend them openly like I befriend anyone else, but I can never approach a guy I have a crush on. It's kind of weird though for some reason because most of my friends are male and I have no problem talking to them and had no problem approaching them when we first met, idk guys I crush on intimidate me (in a good way). 
4	I am and male 
2	I wouldn’t count on it, just ask her to do something fun sometime. It doesn’t have to be a “date” at first, but there should be ways to show her that you like her without having to tell her.\nThere is nothing wrong with liking someone, there is something wrong if they decide to be a jerk about it. But since you guys are already talking I don’t think she’d be turned off. If she initiates most of the conversations then thats a good sign that she likes you. Just be cool, most people just want someone who won’t freak out on them and is awesome to be around.
2	I do and I'm female
2	I’m a male and I’ll flirt and touch and do everything but be straight up and say that I like you in a romantic sense. Trying to get better at that haha 
2	I do and I'm female.  I can't NOT tell someone if I have a crush on them LOL.  But I can also see how that can come off as super aggressive so in my older age (read: 30s) I try not to.  Dang I hate the game, y'all!  Let me liiiiiiive!  
1	I'm more likely to be obvious about it but also kind of not, making me appear kind of \nconfusing. I definitely show a lot of interest, and if they start flirting, I would reciprocate. (If I like them)\n\nIf I do make a move, it would be:\n1. I know that they hold enough interest\n2. I get too impatient \n\nBut usually, I don't realise I like someone until it's too late and when it does it hits hard. Under these cases, I would definitely make the first move. 
1	I'm definitely not.\n\nIt's worse because people may perceive me to be that type as well.\n\nInfact, somebody that I \*like\* could be throwing hints and flirts at me square in the face and I'd still convince myself I'm reading too much into things. 
1	I'm female and I've done it before like twice, but for ME (not all of us!) usually....... not at all.\n\nAlso, my idea of "flirting" consists of being nice, which is what I usually am anyway, so I'm not exactly the most romantically skilled.
22	dealing with a sense of loneliness? [In respect to relationships]	Hi everyone, hope you are having an awesome week!\n\nWanted to ask other ENFJ's (and I guess anyone's advice)!\n\nI'm a 22M ENFJ, I've read about personality types in the past and I really believe ENFJ fits me, I'm constantly trying to do things to improve the lives of others, and many people say I'm one of the most charismatic people they've met and that I can "talk to anyone". Physically I've never heard negative comments and people call me handsome. A lot of things in my life are going as I would hope.\n\nBut the one thing I find that drags me down a lot though, I've been effectively single for the past few years (the only girl I've ever been was almost 3 years ago and I dated her for a month and it didn't feel like a relationship at all), I've had close friendships that I think felt like relationships in someways on an emotional level. But I've never really felt what it's like have a special person in my life that I can really care about and give so much to. \n\nAnd I ask others, ENFJ's are meant to be happiest when in a relationship. having a special person they can be with and wake up next to. But how do you deal with that when you feel alone and you just want someone to care for and to care for you? It makes me think their is something wrong with me, I have so much to give yet and my family say I will make some girl really lucky one day, yet I have no one to give it to/no one seems to want it.\n\nThanks for any advice\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTl;Dr 22M ENFJ feeling alone when it comes to relationships, I've never had a proper relationship and yet people say/I feel I have so much to give, yet no one to give it to. And I'm not always sure to deal with the feeling of loneliness in that regard.
11	So I’m 25 right now and exactly when I was 22 was when I met my s/o, but for 4 years prior I was single and I felt the same way as you. But I have some things to tell you that I wish I could tell past me. \n\n1) yes you are an enfj and making others happy makes you happy, but don’t make the mistake of putting all your stock on happiness into finding someone. This will make you view dating as trying to find someone versus finding the one. You can be perfectly happy solo and in fact, when you are people find it more attractive! \n\n2) even in a relationship, you can possibly date a “taker” that will take all the love you give but feel no need to reciprocate because “that’s just who you are”. That hurts worse that being single. \n\n3) in all likelihood, there is nothing wrong with you and you have to internalize that. But if you’re letting this thought of there being something wrong with you get to your head, LISTEN TO ME, your lack of confidence will be felt. We don’t want that!! As we know, you’re handsome and caring and all those great things. Hype yourself like you would hype ANY other friend \n\n4) be active in pursuing your dating life if it’s important to you! Whether it’s a cup of coffee or dinner sometime, do it! Worst you’ll hear is no. \n\nIt was exactly at the point that I stopped looking that I found someone and I think my issue before was that it was all I cared about and all I thought about. When finding someone is all you care about, you subconsciously put way more pressure on a situation of potentially meeting someone. That pressure probably doesn’t allow you to be the charismatic charmer but rather the worried that the situation won’t work out person. \n\nObviously I don’t know you and I just assumed a lot, like, a lot lot. But hope you were able to find a nugget or two out of this. Best of luck! \n\n
6	If you have no one to give your hapiness to, give it to yourself. I'm sure you know how important self love and confidence is, if you don't love yourself, no one will do it for you. Always remember that it's okay to be alone.\nMy other advice is never date for the sake of being with someone, only be with a person you truly want to be with, and always be honest with yourself and your feelings. \nYou can also try to share your happiness with other important people in your life, friends, family etc... I know it's not the same as having a lover,  but it can bring you a special kind of joy to just make the people close to you happy. I'm sure you already do all of that, so don't worry, all things will fall into place at the right time. 
5	24M ENFJ here. I share many of your traits listed above. In a bit of a twist, though, I pretty much exclusively had strong, long term relationships until I was about 22. My college live in girlfriend at the time cheated on me and that crumbled after that. \n\nSince then, I've been single for about 2 years (hooray math) and have struggled with wanting to find the right person for me considering I feel like I could "make it work" with just about anyone..\n\nWhat has given me solace lately is a tidbit my therapist mentioned. He traced when each of my relationships had started to precisely when I started hanging out with new circles or trying new activities. As an ENFJ, we're blessed to be socially adaptable and people want to befriend us. As such, meeting an SO is surprisingly easier than you'd think. \n\nAdvice: keep your mind open and try a new hobby or class. You'll be surprised how quickly you might at least find the start of something good. \n\nDisclaimer: still single and trying to figure it out lol. Just my two cents.

1	Coming from your 25M introverted brother (INFJ). You lead with the Fe, now consider Fe as not just harmony for others but being, harmony for the group. Remember that you, too, are a part of the group for which you provide this love. And if you cannot give that same love to yourself as you do to others, you will find that feeling of loneliness will persist.\n\nSelf love is still very difficult to do, even I continue to struggle with this but, it gets better each day. It takes little things, continuing to put yourself first, saying "No" when you don't actually wanna do things, forgiving the past, and preparing what comes next, as well as a bit of indulging in a little bit of the inferior function (for me, living in the now Se).\n\nA little bit of counseling I found helps a bit and talking it out with people. Even the sharing on reddit is a good way. I would say continue to work on you, and the rest will follow in time... you are only 22 after all. lol
1	Relationships are not the key to happiness, nor are they a good source for happiness.  ENFJs definitely struggle with this because we get our energy from others and the idea of having one person that will be there for us no matter what provides us with a constant supply of social energy. I've definitely struggled with this in my late teens to mid20's.  This is why I serial dated and pretty much was rarely ever single for more than 3 months.  Constantly chasing relationships and finding "the one".  I mean this didn't do much for me aside from giving me social skills and giving myself and idea of what kind of partner I wanted.   It was at the same time also very demoralizing because the more I met with people and failed at the relationship, the more disappointment I felt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSocial media and regular media portrays love as being the ultimate answer for happiness.  Guy meets girl, girl falls for guy, they have their happy ending.  It doesn't really show the amount of work and effort between two people need to put to nurture and foster the relationship.  Same for people you know IRL.  You see them posting pictures online about how happy they are, and then you see them happy together.  However, it's not like people want to show the struggles they have with their partner in front of their friends or loved ones.  Not unless their relationship is really dysfunctional.  It takes a lot of communication and compromise to get to that point where you can truly love someone.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo me, love comes in stages: infatuation (honeymoon period), falling in love (having first arguments and learning to talk), being in love (mainatained relationship).  Love isn't about making the other person happy or them making you happy.  It's about enjoying the company of one another and just enhancing whatever existing happiess ya'll have for yourselves by sharing experiences with one another.  If you're unhappy with your life and expect having a partner to suddenly fix everything, that's just the wrong way to go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy advice?  You should put yourself out there and date different people to get a feel of what type of girl you want in your life.  You'll be faced with disappointment and maybe heartbreak, but life is about taking risks and falling down sometimes. It's just important you keep on getting back up.  You can take breaks and work on yourself, but this is very important.  After all, the good things in life require some work put into it.  If you're not feeling it with someone, be decisive and end it before it drags on for too long.  However, at the same time, you should give the person some time and patience to see if something could happen.  Some people will give you an instant zing, while others take a bit of time to open up.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm 28/F and I met my fiance when I was 25.  I met him at a club, as I was trying to get over a recent breakup.  I took a risk and asked him if I could spend the night because public transportation was down.  We were both blasted and ended up chilling in his room talking about our entire life experiences.  Fast forward to today, we are engaged.   The point of this is that love is extremely improbable and can spark from the most riskiest situations.  I could have stolen his stuff, he could have probably taken advantage of me.  Murder could have happened, but nope.  We got to know one another and eventually feelings bloomed.  I had never felt this close to anyone in my life and I dated a lot of guys.  Meeting that right person is going to be completely random and won't happen unless you put yourself out there.  Go on dating apps, go to meet up events, etc etc.  Most importantly, work on yourself to hit a point where you're completely content on your own.  That way, you wont need to rely on someone else to make you happy.
29	As an INFJ I’ve already fallen in love with all of you. You all sound like lovely people!	Gotta find one for myself... just need to leave the house 😜
11	INFJs are awesome people too. I married one! I wish you the best in meeting an ENFJ as your marriage partner!
5	One of my closest friends was an INFJ! We love you guys too :) 
3	Ha that’s nice of ya! Good luck 👍🏻 
2	I'm an infj and my bf is an enfj. Go find one RIGHT NOW, mine's great ❤
2	My girlfirend is an INFJ, you guys make a great fit! 
2	I heard ENFP is most compatible with you guys\n\nBut more power to ya either way!!
2	You are all super people in my opinion. Keep being amazing, you all mean more to me (enfj) than you realize
2	I'm an INFJ too and after studying different types last night, I decided I needed to find an ENFJ too :)
1	My mom is an INFJ! You guys are great!
1	My best friend is INFJ, and though our relationship is strictly platonic, we always tell each other that we want someone like each other as a romantic partner, and we mean it haha
1	My girlfirend is an INFJ, you guys make a great fit! 
1	same
1	I’m an INFJ and my best friend’s an ENFJ! I love her so much
1	I feel the same! INFJ here. ENFJ sounds very energising to me! Big hugs 
14	I’m almost 30 and in my whole adult life I’ve never met an enfj woman personally. Not to say there weren’t any around me, I just never met them. I wonder how different an enfj woman would differ from a man. Anyone with experience?	
7	Hi I’m an ENFJ AF woman, AMA
4	I don't think there's much of a difference.  My ENFJ best friend is a guy and I'm a girl, and typically we are on the same wavelength.  He tends to be a bit more sensitive than me, but I don't think it has anything to do with MBTI.  We are all individuals and the only thing that would really differentiate ENFJs from one another is how they grew up.
4	ENFJ lady here! 
4	If a stranger is struggling/needs to have a problem solved in a public space and a woman approaches to help for no reason but just to be purely friendly, there is 70% chance you've found an ENFJ woman. (She has to be visibly friendly, amused, and interested while she is nonchalantly doing this and does not look for anything or even thanks in return because what she did was rewarding in itself).
4	My older sister is ENFJ, I'd say there isn't much difference other than girls are girls so she gets much more attention for being as confident as she is, I am totally not jealous, no, I am not, don't @ me.
2	I haven't even met a fellow enfj irl
2	Enfj lady here who recently met an enfj man for the first time! We did have some striking similarities.
2	My wife is an ENFJ and so am I!
3	25. Male ENFJ. AMA	I'm a 25 year old guy living in the states. AMA.
2	What mbti type are you most drawn to? \nWhich mbti types are most drawn to you?\n(Please separate your male/female/(?) samples) thank you 🙏🏻
2	What does masculinity mean to you?
1	Hai!! How’s life going? What goals do you have and how are they progressing?
1	What's your stance on being emotionally expressive? 
19	You might be an ENFJ if you...	Fill in the blank! :) 
67	Find yourself caring about the one person in the group who is bored or isn't having fun
35	Sacrifice your happiness for other ppl’s happiness
27	You put your team before yourself.
19	Gather skills and knowledge that will help you connect with a large variety of people
19	end every conversation with an inspiring speech about how great the person you're speaking to is.
19	Just wish they would JUST DO THE THING. I DON'T CARE HOW, BARBARA, JUST HELP ME HELP YOUUUUUU.\n\n...\n\n...find yourself being pushy. 
20	Having one side be very immature, while another very mature and keep switching between them just like a light switch when someone's in the bathroom.
36	If people thought you were shy at first then realized you were just waiting for the right time to show your crazy side.
14	Prefer to use metaphors to explain concepts to people
6	At the end of the day feel like you love everyone. Even the shitty people. Because at the end of the day we all just need more love.
4	go between getting bored often and easily distracted 😞
9	What drives people crazy about the ENFJs!	
1	Great video! Thanks for posting it here.
1	Eye candy and thanks for the sweetness. Lol. 
43	It hurts...	It's a hard fact to accept that everyone is not as thoughtful and caring as we are. I try so hard to be a good friend and a decent person. I sacrifice so much of my self and my time and energy. It hurts though because I feel so unappreciated at times. Betrayal and lack of reciprocation seem to be recurring themes in my life. Is that normal for ENFJ'S? Am I doing something wrong? The hurt part of me just wants to say "Fuck the world!" but deep down I know that I could never stop caring about others. How do you handle that feeling?\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for your wonderful insight and encouragement. Usually things like this don't get to me but I was having a rough day. Thank you for being you and supporting me. The world is a better place because of you ❤
15	Yeah, that's why I hate the idea of being with people but I still need to be with people so badly. I think that's part of our nature, to give what we think is the best and hope that people can see our intentions and give back. \n\nBut, I think most people are oblivious our intentions or may have misunderstood us. And I'm starting to see a pattern in that we make ourselves so or even too readily available to be good to people that they don't think they need to appreciate us because we'll be there anyway. \n\nI think the answer is to care less about what they will give back. We've only got so much space in our hearts to care for a certain amount of people, and not everyone is going to reciprocate the way we want them to. I know for sure that if I keep giving to people who are bad to me, I'm going to flip and become a really cold and uncaring person. \n\nSo...I do what I believe is best for the people around me, and distance myself from the people who hurt me. Most of the time, I don't think they can even see that I'm trying to be better for them (but it's not exactly for them but to sate the desire to create a perfect environment for wholesome and fulfilling interactions). And at this point, I just don't really care so much that they can't see my intentions. \n \nIf they do see it and reciprocate, that would be really really special. And if they don't, I'll still be good to them in hopes that they grow to see the big picture I'm trying to achieve. 
6	Soooo. I just got laid off on 1/4.  Found jobs for my entire team.   I don’t have a new job yet myself and I’m really depressed.  Disappointed in myself for once again taking care of everyone but myself.  I’m stuck in that awful loop we get as ENFJs-the your not good enough, self doubt bull shit.   So sorry you are hurting.   Just know I feel ya.  
6	You are certainly not alone in this feeling. \n\nFor me it has been helpful to try and focus less on receiving appreciation of others or even that I'm particularly being helpful to others. If I am able to frame my actions more as simply me being true to myself, behaving as I choose regardless of whether other people also behave or think as I do. \n\nThen my 'reward' is more "being true to myself " and "living a genuine, purposeful life" and less dependent on the reactions of others.. Though I am definitely still affected.. Somewhat less so. I hope that a slight change of perspective can be helpful to you. 
9	That’s life yo. When the bads and lows hit, they hit us hard. \nDon’t let it change you tho. Every person deserves their own chance. Don’t let past people ruin outlooks on future unrelated people
3	It’s sad to say that I 100% agree. I don’t have many close friends and I’m OK with that. I’m constantly hurt by them because I try time and time again to show them I am a good person and deserve at least half of the effort and consideration that I put into the relationship, from them.  But it’s okay, I go into every relationship I have with people with very high expectations. And those who really care will show me that I can trust them with my tender heart and thoughts.  My fiancée and one good friend that I do have, have done that. And those relationships are ones that I will cherish. \n\nQuality vs quantity 
2	learn to be a little bit more selfish. help others,but not at the expense of yourself.  I'd rather stay away from the "nice guy" mentality, because if you do things expecting stuff in return, it's not sincere.  IMO it's better to except your good gesture as something u did good mentally, feeling good you did good should be good enough.  If you expect people to return the favor, then you'll forever be trapped in wanting that external validation.  
2	It is important to get into self care and to limit your exposure. Yes you will feel that way because the nature of an ENFJ is to care for through giving. People like to take advantage of it because they think it’s ok because we are so good at hiding it. However, people will never understand as you do because ENFJs are rare. But start taking care of you as well. I wish you the best. Keep your head up.
2	I can totally empathize with you and have suffered mightily, feeling the same way you do. It took me a long time to figure out that being an ENFJ is like being Santa Claus. People want the gift of our love but they only love us when they need us. It was thinking that way that lead me to see that Love is only a gift. It is hard to turn your mind around that because we seem to hunger for the same love we give and rarely ever find it or can feel it when it is there. But love is a gift. And a gift is something we choose to give in order to make someone else feel loved or happy. When we give a gift then we should ideally be happy that we made the other person happy. It was something we pick out specifically to honor them. It is when I start to expect a gift in return that I see that I didn't give the gift as a present but as manipulation, trying to get the other person to give me something in return. It helps to know that. It helps me to know that expecting a return or reciprocation is my self centered manipulative self coming out. It still hurts but not as much. It makes me proud to be me. 
2	I think this is more like enneagram type 2 problem than ENFJ. While many ENFJs are type 2 but quite a noticable amount of them aren't. So we are least likely to find your thread relatable and might be more difficult to give advice. I'm suggesting you head up to Enneagram type 2 discussion and find the way to develop into a healthier version of you from there.
1	TLDR: Mission and Vision should drive us, not the expectation of reciprocation. \n\nWe gotta do ENFJ things for the right reasons.  If you're doing kind deeds to get an equal measure of kindness in return you'll be disappointed your whole life!  Those of us who are ENFJs will ***never*** get back what we give and that's what makes us unique.  I'd go so far as to say don't expect ***anything at all*** in return so that even the smallest reciprocating gesture feels huge.  I try to live my life this way, and I understand it hurts sometimes when your friends or family don't respond how you think they should (how you'd respond if you were in their shoes).  \n\nIf you're doing nice things just to be recognized or get something in return, then you're doing it wrong.  You're gonna need to change your perspective because your circumstances won't likely change if you're truly an ENFJ.  Hope this helps. 
1	It hurts a bit less knowing that a lot of people feel the same way as me (and you). Being sensitive and good hearted is, however tough it can be, a blessing: you have so much that you can afford to give some of it away to others! I’m still learning to identify the people who will give some of it back when I feel frail, and that includes me learning not to always have all the answers for myself and others, and asking for help. Sometimes being there for others makes you seem stronger than you are, and more emotionally independent than what you are. Dare asking for help. In my experience, people will surprise you. And if they don’t yet, they will. Trust in that, and in the meantime, look out for the kid in you too. 
1	You’ve gotta meet some more ENFJ friends! On a more serious note though, start investing in the relationships you have that are reciprocal. Give more to those who give to you. That’s what I’ve been working on.
1	Hey man, people do care as much as you they just show it in different ways.
8	Careers?	Hi all!\n\nI'm an ENFJ starting out in the adult world and I have no idea what I want to do long term...I wondered what hat you all do for jobs that you feel relate to being ENFJ in particular? Are there certain things you look for etc?\n\nInspiration is all appreciated as my boring office job is soul destroying!\nThanks
6	Anything that allows me to interact with people on a regular basis and allows me to make some kind of impact or difference on others lives. I currently work in healthcare. \n\nI have also thought about going back to school to get my PhD so I could be a professor. That would allow me to let my extroversion shine while also teaching and mentoring students. \n\nBefore obtaining my degree, I worked a lot in the retail industry, for my high extrovertedness and social skills allowed me to be a very good salesman. 
4	Teaching, nursing, social work, and counseling are always the most suggested for me on career aptitude tests. I suspect these go right along with the ENFJ type. Anything dealing with people where you need that patience and compassion.
3	I tried to apply the ikigai chart to my options. If you can find something that fits in all boxes then you are good to go. I ended up in water management, specifically aquatic ecotechnology. It is a mix of civil engineering, biology, chemistry, physics, and a section with economy, laws and policies. It is really varied and it allows me to venture into different workfields. We work in 2 modules per semester , so about 8 weeks per module and every module consists of at least 3 practicals, a field week and a project with various companies in my country , so it is rarely the same, and you acquire a lot of knowledge on different topics. The future prospect of employment is good, because climate change will provide a lot of work for us
3	I would suggest also taking the enneagram test. It will help you focus a little more. I, as An ENFJ am a helper, I have had several jobs wherein I help. But to do one better, search for ENFJ careers on the web and it will give you a better idea where you will fit. \n\n&#x200B;
3	Human Resources is a great field that includes clerical and people interactions. I have the perfect balance with both and I’m very happy in my career. 
3	My job is perfect for me. We’ll always need funeral directors! It’s not for everyone, but it is definitely something to look into. I live in the Midwest United States, and there is definitely a need for good funeral professionals. 
1	Hey!  So I'm female ENFJ and I am a court reporter/stenographer.  It is only the most perfect career for us for several reasons.  Plus we need more people in our industry as the older court reporters begin to retire, so AHEM let me convince you to go to court reporting school lol!  So I actually live in Hong Kong now and get paid to travel the fucking world.  I have my rent paid for for my company and everything, flight, hotels, food, etc is paid for.  I have been to China, Taiwan, Korea, India, Cambodia, Japan, Singapore, Thailand, and England all for work.  I make about 150k a year (I honestly have no idea what I made last year lol) and have next to no bills minus my cell phone and internet so it's mostly money in da bank y'allllll.  We work somewhere different every day (unless I get a trial, but that's at the MOST one month in one place), I meet new people every day, I have to navigate different social situations every single day.  It's always fresh, it's always new.  It can be extremely stressful, but if you're ENFJ I'd assume you like a challenge, too :)  Okay I'll step off my soap box hahah! Good luck in whatever you decide!  
1	Found this artist and i'm certain she's an eNFJ	
6	How do you guys act when you like someone? And what are key things to look for to tell with en ENFJ?	
4	Personally- I'm overly friendly until they start showing interest even though, I want them. I think it's a combination of my attachment style(anxious attachment). Now that I'm dating someone, I've learned that to optimize our time together, I need my space with other people and importantly, by myself. \n\nI'm just super sensitive to his emotions and internalize them as my own. And I logically know they aren't mine. So space is especially important. \n\nWe really enjoy each other. He's an introvert and he grounds me and that is so vitally important to me. I bring out the goofy fun guy in him and he makes me feel like the most special girl in the world but the beginning was hard. I think I just needed to grow up (I was 18/19 when we started dating. He was 27) and learn how to take care of myself. 
4	I "test the water first" to see if I really like the person, if the feelings are mutual and if it could be something serious. \n Then, as soon as I'm comfortable, I try to keep in touch as much as I can, unless I feel like I'm being overwhelming. If the other person seems just as excited as I am about keeping in touch, talking, texting etc... then I try to let them know that I'm interested.\n I'm personally not the most subtle "flirty" type, so to me it's pretty obvious when I'm interested in someone. I keep going to see them if I feel like they want to see me, I do everything I can to please them and make them happy, I get them gifts about inside jokes (I like getting gifts to people in general though), I talk about what I want in the future etc...\n As soon as I feel the smallest restrain from the other person though, I completely stop, it may be extreme, but I really don't wanna be a bother to anyone. \nThat's just from my experience though, and I haven't "liked" many people, in any case, I hope it helps! 
2	Dealing with a sour ENFJ?	Hello, I have no idea what I am.\n\nI have gotten results such as ISFP, ISTJ, and one-time ENTP.\n\nNow for the most part I get along pretty well with ENFJ'S.\n\nThe one I'm about to talk about I got along fine with for a few years before something just snapped all of a sudden and him.\n\nAnd I have not figured out the correct way to deal with him.\n\n1. He walks into every confrontation believing that he is right. That he is correct both factually and that he holds the moral High ground and that no matter how much of a temper tantrum he throws the person he's screaming at is completely in the wrong.\n\n2. He is needlessly confrontational and seems to have no concept of how his own behavior is but is obsessed with everyone else adhering to a certain standard of behavior. \n\n3. He is needlessly nit-picky about things which I think fuels the whole he has to be right about everything mind set he's got. Still there are times when he is so pointlessly obsessed with correcting people that it comes off like he's just trying to pick a fight.\n\nI really don't want to come to blows with this guy because I respect him as my elder. He is in his mid-50s and I am younger. But he really needs to back off sometimes. He's coming off like someone who seems to think that if you are not useful to him in some way that you are basically useless.\n\nSo ENFJ folks what is the best way to diffuse one of your own when they are acting like this?\n\nAlso if it helps any on the Enneagram scale he's either a stressed 2w1, that flies into eight mode really fast. Or he actually is a type-8. In other words very aggressive and inflexible.
10	Seems more like entj behavior than enfj, an enfj is more understanding and people-oriented. An entj cares more about results and is task-oriented.\nI may be horribly mistaken and he could just have his feelings hurt (enfjs are sensitive) because of something that he finds hard to address (they feel the need to live up to their own perfect image).\nI don’t think it would be too hard to try showing him some care and ask him how come he’s behaving this way even if he may not deserve it. It may seem manipulative to care about him so he stops treating you this way, but it would only hurt him if he doesn’t cooperate with you when you ask him. Patience, clarity, and harmony are important when speaking to enfjs.\nBest of luck! Let us know how it goes😁
1	ENFJs are more likely to step into your shoes and question why they are wrong...\n\nSounds a bit like my ESTJ mom, but who knows :)
12	Overcoming negativity with positivity	I'm a generally positive person, but I have days where everything is negative and I have a hard time getting out of it.\n\nI'm much better than I used to be, since I notice it and I try to engage in positive activities to counterbalance. There are days where it's harder though, so I'm looking for ideas.\n\nWhat brings joy to your heart in those difficult moments? What activities do you engage in when you find yourself in a dark place? What are your tricks to find your positivity again?
8	I think that we generally soak up the negativity of the world and take it upon ourselves; of course we like that and we're better equipped for it than most. But it can definitely become too much. I think we all just need to have the patience and wherewithal to take time for ourselves when we need it. You probably know what most works for you. \n\nFor me it's often: reconnecting with an old good friend, one of the few that will be for me what I would be for others; enjoying some form of art that I find very meaningful; exercise, spending time with my son... lots of stuff actually, things I wish I had more time for.
4	Write down your thoughts and try to figure out why you feel the way you do. Sometimes our brain needs to organize the thoughts running through it. Often times you’ll find that it’s some little thing that you can actually fix or you just needed to rationalize something by writing it down and asking a bunch of why questions. \n\nOtherwise, spend time with your closest friends and to get other perspectives as well. 
4	For me it’s spending time with my dog at the park or even putting on my favorite show and doing crafts. Or working out. Stuff to make your mind relax and focus on something else.  ENFJ can often dwell in negative thought so it does get very hard sometimes. 
2	I usually get out of those ruts by either A) Stepping out of my routine (Take a walk downtown, visit somewhere I haven't been on a while or that I have never visited, etc) or B) Talking to someone I haven't been in touch with for a while or C) Opening my box of mementos and reminiscing good times (This gives me strength to think there are good times ahead).
2	Bubble baths, bro
1	I have this combo that alllllways gets me out of a negative mood, basically I start by doing high intensity work outs than take a long hot shower afterwards a I start reading a book immediately after leaving the bathroom, not to mention drawing sometimes could also help a lot even if I'm not that skilled.
1	i chat with my friends until i feel better or I distract myself with video games and binge watching.
1	I’m here right now. A lot of really stressful things going on and it’s causing my anxiety to skyrocket. I’ve definitely sunk into a pretty intense depression the past couple of days. \n\nMostly I just try and keep my mind occupied. Reading helps, or running errands. Usually I would talk it out, but most of my friends are busy dealing with their own stuff. 🤷🏻‍♀️
1	watching movies , preferably with some drama so i can be somewhat engaged but at the same time disconnect from RL .
20	Afraid of overstaying my welcome	I find that a lot of the time my behaviour around people changes depending on if I feel the other person is enjoying my company or just tolerating it.\n\nI think it boils down to me having a fear that I will overstay my welcome with someone. I really want people to enjoy my company so I will purposely hold myself back and start doubting myself when I would really love to dive deeper and spend more time/get to know someone. Sometimes when I let my enthusiasm take over I end up apologising for the weird topic etc\n\nI am mindful of not smothering someone and making sure I am easy going and flexible. I find I’m quite passive in friendships, especially new ones as I tend to let the other person take the lead and define what kind of relationship we’ll have or for them to decide what role they want me to have in their lives. \n\nEven though I can distinguish quickly how close I’d like to be with someone I feel like I usually have to introduce myself slowly, like gaining the trust of a wild animal. \nBeing older I am not looking for surface level friends. I want to connect, to accept the other person and also be accepted as well. Im still afraid though if I go from 0-100 I’m going to scare them off with my intensity so I hold myself back. Then I get the follow up issue of feeling like they get the impression I’m being secretive...\n\nWhen I feel people drifting from me I hold myself back and give them space. Maybe they want me to chase after them, but in the case they actually need space I want to be respectful. \n\nAny other ENFJs have any experiences like this or advice? 
11	tis the enfj curse
10	I struggle with this as well. It mainly shows when I am trying to connect with someone of the opposite sex. I have began to do the same thing as you. Showing interest in a friendship/relationship, then backing off. I have scared people out of my life before by being too upfront and honest too quickly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently, I tend to tell people that I am not a surface level person, and therefore I am not looking for surface level relationships. Being upfront in that manner helps alleviate awkwardness and tension in later engagements with that individual.  
5	I could have written this! Especially in my relationship with my in-laws. I still have no idea if they like me at all...we are so different but are tied together in marriage and have to stay under the same roof for multiple days at a time and I always wonder if people are tolerating me and my different views/beliefs or if they genuinely like me. So I tend to hold back but then that makes me emotional because no one is making an effort to connect and I feel lonely and unloved...it’s a super vicious circle. \n\nI am an open and honest person and I think what has helped me a lot is being very open and vulnerable with my in-laws about this part of my insecurity. I think they now know my heart is in the right place but they need to meet me in the middle. I describe it as “I’m always at the park waiting for you to join, but I’m not going to ring your doorbell.” (Even though I totally want to, but that would be too pestery/invasive). To protect myself from sitting alone at the figurative “park”, just waiting, I bring a book or some other intellectual or creative pursuit to work on for me while I wait to meet others in the middle. \n\nIf you’re familiar with the Enneagram, many ENFJs are 2s. When 2s set healthy boundaries for themselves, they become more like healthy 4s and enjoy creative activities. As I’ve been more firm with my own boundaries for myself and others I have definitely seen this creative spark come alive again. 
3	Damn this is actually pretty wholesome, someone had made it out to me you ENFJs were manipulative af. I relate to wanting to find a serious connection, I’m an infp, I don’t really know what advice to give but you seem like a good person. Just be yourself and if people don’t like it then they ain’t worth your time, ik it’s probs hard cos you guys wanna be giving a good time but don’t worry if you seem like an ass to people who just aren’t worth your time. 
3	These posts are always interesting to me. I’m ENFJ and i relate to this whole heartedly, yet is this really an mbti thing or just a non-mbti preference thing 
2	I used to be like that in high school! As an ENFJ guy and being in college for over a year I find the biggest help with meeting others is finding topics you can connect on with the other person. If you have control of the conversation just be yourself and talk about the things you might be interested in. Or ask questions you know that can be expounded upon! Let the other person know what kind of person you are in those first reactions and that they don’t have to win you over with body language and how you speak. After that it’s how you follow through with others and your actions like actually texting someone when you say you will! Hope that helps some! Just remember to let others be themselves also if you ever offer advice or if they might not give any positive vibes when speaking to you! Overthinking things puts you in a never ending loop with how ENFJ’s deal with our emotions!
10	(Survey) Relationship Between Personality Type and Drug Use	
5	Hi there, if possible I think a better system would be a ranking of top 3 or 5 from most to least used\n\n&#x200B;
10	Can we "learn" logic?	I am an ENFJ and my boyfriend is an INTP. I understand that every type has a dominant function (mine being Fe and his Ti), so naturally has more capability or preference for particular areas over others - such as employing logic or emotion. I also understand that people (outwith personality type) are innately dissimilar and have different skills in differing areas. I do believe that as ENFJ/INTP we have something of a “growth” relationship and we often have conversations concerning self-improvement. However, the closer we become, the more acutely obvious it has become to us both how lacking in logic my reasoning and thoughts are (I’ll not make reference to aspects of his growth discussed - that is his business). I can’t help but feel deficit in some way and would like to ask the general opinion as to whether one can “learn” - or refine/develop - aspects which do not come completely naturally, such as logic for an ENFJ?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nApologies in advance for any inaccuracies or generalisations. Thanks for any thoughts!
13	I \[ENFJ\] was married to an INTP for 9 years. I've read that this combination can be very complimenting. I do think you can "learn" logic or improve your logic, but it is not easy. Both my ex husband and I rubbed off on each other. I became more logical and he became more social and emotionally expressive. I say it is hard because it took the whole 9 years to see these changes and on my end the changes hurt... a lot. I didn't feel loved because of his constant criticisms or pointing out all that awesome logic that I missed. Funny thing, he missed out on a lot of great human connections due to his directness and lack of emotion. Caring about and nurturing the feelings of others does not come easily for INTP's, well at least in my experience. The way he communicated to me added a great deal of emotional distress to me in his attempt to help me see things his way. It was the reason for the divorce. I learned to be more logical and street smart simply after years of observing how his brain worked. I started to put together patterns and see how his thoughts were progressing. He loved to talk and work thru his ideas with me; he says I was the best sounding board he ever had. I do think you can learn to be more logical, but don't get obsessed with the idea or start to see less value in who you are and what you bring to the table. Appreciate your differences and grow as you can.
11	[deleted]
7	I am an enfj with a degree in philosophy with a logic concentration.  I recommend sudoku to develop your logic to start.
4	I'm pretty sure we can, I developed it at a quite young age.\n\n* First off, don't see it as your enemy. It actually serves your feelings. Logic helps me in handling a lot of problems, even an argument to shut people off from hurting others.\n* Surround yourself with people who are relatively well balanced between handling emotions and logic. Usually 50y+ people. I was raised up by a healthy ESTJ mom, she's the greatest woman I ever met. If you learn logic from people who are suck in delivering a message, it will become a huge hindrance for you to feel natural at adopting logic.\n* Start connecting things. Ti is meant to connect all information to make a whole big logical framework. **Think** and read anything you like. Mine: conspiracy theory and politics.\n* Exercise a bit mathematics. Focus: possibility, probability, geometry + calculate the distance latitude/longitude between two points on earth, the one that use Venn Diagram, stuff like if A > B, B > C, then A > C. Even though it may sound funny, trust me many people seem to neglect the application in real life. Set up a schedule to do them.\n* My country favors Feelings over Thinking, it's only natural if you meet INTPs and ESTJSs who are more social butterfly and emotionally caring than you ENFJ. My point is, everybody can be anything they want. It takes action to do that. Goodluck!\n\np/s : Sorry for the brokened grammar, not an english speaker here.
5	Technically, ENFJs have Ti as their 4th function, so we do use logic pretty often when we are introspecting or withdrawing into our minds. We can make our logic make sense, but it's going to be pretty unpredictable/fickle from the Ti-dom's point of view. I would think that we centre our logic around values and feelings rather than facts and pragmatism. Other types, especially Feelers, with Ti in their shadow functions are probably going to never really going to make logic a priority in their life, and it probably doesn't matter because what they excel at is what guides them on their path. 
2	Of course! Logic / reasoning can definitely be learned. The more critical thinking you do, whether that's finding the best deals for groceries or identifying all the risks / pros/ cons to how to finance a new house, the better you get. I think the key is to expose yourself to more info, think about how you could improve something, or do other mental exercises like logic / reasoning puzzles (you can find a lot of puzzle / brain teaser books at places like Barnes and nobles) 
4	Feelers can improve their logic to some extent but only the truly exceptional ones can reach the level of an average Thinker.
2	You surely can improve it but unlike with intp it just won't come natural to you just like we will never be as good with people. My mom was an enfj and I'm intp, she thought she had logic but usually it was pretty bad logic with most things but she was still the best person I have met and it didn't matter. You don't need better logic, you have lots to offer that an intp lacks and respects probably. I would suggest your defer more often to the intp even if you don't understand the logic instead of arguing with bad logic, sometimes you will be right and he will be wrong though, it's difficult to comment on individual people, this is more guessing on average. 
1	Yes you can and I did it by accidentally choosing non mbti optimal job (Linux computer technician) before I understood this science. This has sharpened my Ti over the course of three years but it was very difficult in the beginning and I had to aspire to take on the challenge. I yawned to tears and doubted myself and let emotional reactions take over occasionally for a long time but eventually I sharpened Ti permanently and it has helped me in all areas requiring Ti (even just general logical reasoning).
1	Have an ENFJ uncle that's a lead programmer for a very large company.  Lead of the leads.  Took him a lot of discipline.
1	logic is a muscle. it takes a lot of time to develop, and u need the proper training .  \n1 suggest going keto carnivore/ dryfasting to pump up ketones and have the optimal fuel   \n2 suggest diving into cold showers, boosts logic   \n3 read ayn rand, shes the elite logician . contemporary thomas sowell is also cool.  \n4 subscribe to podcasts articles regarding neuroscience  \n5 develop some hobbies that work ur brain, gaming, u can take some from him and do it together   \n6 watch reality shows with him and disect analyze behaviors  
10	Can we be controlling	Usually ENFJs are said to social chameleons who blend in with the crowd due to the dom Fe. This is true for me in every extent. However, occasionally I get rather bossy and have a tendency to control people. Can someone explain this?
10	You see an efficient way to make many people happy or to have many be very productive in a short amount of time, and when you bring the strategy, you get push-back. Without their buy-in, you can be seen as pushy.\n\nI have this issue, so I basically begin on what I can accomplish and I try to know the other's motivation. Do they just want credit? Is it their ego and need compliments? Then I try to include them in my productivity with small effort things.\n\nSometimes my husband is procrastinating way too much and I need to hold him accountable. I start the project alone, asking for input, "does this shelf look okay here?" And I get a response, "no, I'd bump into it. Try the other wall." (Got the buy-in) Then I can find the studs, but I suddenly can't use a level correctly. "Is it best to use tape or a pencil to find the level?" Is simply asking for his expertise, complimenting him on what he knows better (even if slightly), and giving him an opportunity to come be the hero. It isn't me asking for help or telling him to come help, but asking for his knowledge so I can apply it. I usually step back and he wants to show me how he does it, and hangs the shelf for me. If I had nagged him, "why haven't you hung the shelf like you said you would?" To keep him accountable, then I wouldn't have his buy in, he wouldn't feel included, and I would been seen as bossy. Granted, on things I want to learn, I have to approach it with more compliments and saying, "I want to learn to do that thing", otherwise he just does it his way.\n\nThis works well with power tools, too. "How do I turn the safety off on the chainsaw?" XD 
2	Yes and sometimes we control people/act controlling without even knowing/meaning to. My best friend sometimes warns me to be careful not to get that way whenever I might chat with him about people in my life. Sometimes I go “whoops here I go doing it again” 
2	Extremely controlling, and we know it.  It's so easy to read people as an ENFJ, so easy to take control.  It's second nature to us.  It can be a very bad trait for us, something we need to guard against.  E - Extrovert without any qualms of stepping in.  N- Intuitive - we know how to control from the get-go.  F - Feeling - damn the torpedoes, we are going to do it my way.  J - Judging.  Screw you if you don't agree.\n\nNobody can gaslight like an ENFJ - "You realize you sound crazy, right?"  That rolls off our tongues like butter.
1	A lot of times I’ll feel the same way, but I won’t know how to properly explain it in words. Like I know if I took control of the situation it’d be better or more organized. But, I also am afraid of rejection so I’m afraid to say half the things I think. 
28	How do you other ENFJs cope with anger?	I think as an ENFJ, being that we obviously engage our emotions pretty readily as they come, and with intensity, that we should find an outlet for the emotions we struggle most to project into the world. For example, anger. True anger, which I think I can speak for most ENFJs in saying that being openly angry feels almost sinful, because of the way it can negatively impact the emotional environment for everyone around. I feel like this habit, although it has good intentions, can be really damaging to my sense of closure with issues that upset me, and I’m wondering if other ENFJs feel the same way.  \n\nIt’s not that I am an angry person, far from it. And it honestly takes a lot for me to get angry about something, but I feel like the things I’m truly angry about can never be expressed. The most effective method I’ve encountered in venting anger when I’m experiencing it is pushing myself really hard through a workout, and listening to music that gets my heart rate up and my gears turning in my mind in an attempt to rationalize my anger into productive energy, but sometimes I just want to scream and kick and punch. I feel that that’s a very human reaction that deserves to be satisfied somehow, but I wouldn’t ever want to hurt someone, obviously. \n\nI’m just wondering how other ENFJs out there feel about expressing their anger (safely) instead of trying to ignore it until it fizzles out. I’m tired of being emotionally positive for everyone else’s sake. I’m always giving other people a place to express their emotions safely and fully but I don’t always give myself the same opportunities. Any advice/similar experiences to share?
23	I bottle it up, don't show or act on it. I do this because I feel like I don't get to be angry like other people. Like people get angry at me fie being upset, so now I just don't anymore. Sucks, sometimes I wish I could be irrational like everyone else, just for a moment. What do you guys suggest I do? 
15	(1) have a screaming match with another extrovert (recommend: estj)\n\n(2) vent with an Introverted thinker who won't be offended no matter what you say because they don't care anyway \n\nAhahaha\n\n\n\n
10	I’m really confused. The way some people write ENFJs makes me feel like I should be this benevolent figure of complete harmony and tranquility.\n\nNo.\n\nIf you disrupt peace by being a prick, whether you barge past another person on a train to get to the last seat, or speak out of turn to an innocent person I will be the first to let you know that you are a prick. Depending on the severity of what you did, I will kick up a FUSS, even if it means escalating the situation temporarily. I do not care about how angry I look or come across. \n\nI. Do. Not. Care.\n\nEDIT: I do not necessarily condone this behaviour, and I would like to highlight that I believe my reactions largely scale okay in accordance to the severity of the perpetrator’s act.\nOn the other hand, if someone I’m close to acts up reaaaally bad (rare) I am prone to ghosting them and bottling up. Usually, they’ll know *why* I’m blanking them, so I’m not sure that this counts as passive aggression – but it’s usually more damaging than outright confrontational skirmishes. 
7	Honestly, the only thing that helps with my anger and overthinking is working out. It helps clear my mind and I’m able to think much more rationally. I don’t ignore the issues, but I seem to be able to go back in and visit them with more clarity.
7	Oh fuck this is like my biggest issue in life.\n\nI have never been good at letting anger out so I bottle it up instead until I finally blow. Or, I used to do that at least.\n\nI have found that what works best for me is to express my emotions in words. If I get irritated by something I push myself to mention that instead of letting it slide. It sucks, I really really hate to do it, but it also fucking helps. It helps so much and it makes me feel much more listened to (most of the time). \n\nEdit: must also agree that when this is not possible working out really helps. 
7	I get angry. I say I'm angry, sternly but fairly express my umnet needs, and request a change.\n\nI love feeling angry. After so many years of caretaking other people's emotions, it's fabulous to say "Nope, that behavior is bullshit and I'm not here for it." I feel like a knight coming to my own rescue.\n\nIt's taken a long time and a lot of therapy to get here. And even when I do feel angry, there are still a bevy of cajoling voices that pipe up:  What if they get mad at you? It's better just to let things go. Be patient. Empathy is best." Sometimes it takes a day for me to even realize that I am angry, and longer for me to know what I need to say.\n\nBut I fully believe that we need anger. We deserve it. All of these pressure valves are nice, but if the real issues are still rankling inside, it's toxic. \n\nIt's not our responsibility to carry the world's turds.
6	I find that a good outlet is cleaning - like deep cleaning. Usually when I’m disinfecting cupboards or scrubbing the bathtub my brother asks what happened. Productive, healthy, fairly effective outlet for me!
6	I bottle it up, when someone tries to piss me off, then i will become quiet and my face will transform from the resting serial killer face to the angry serial killer face. If i feel like breaking then i remove myself from the situation untill i calm myself down. The last time i lost my shit was 2 years ago and prior to that , almost 5 years ago. I keep a tight lid on it because i have been on the other side too many times so i don't want to spread harm unless something really rustles my jimmies. I have some outlets but not enough to ever fully releave the pressure
5	I am so glad you posted this. Anger is always tough for an ENFJ. We are a harmony seeking a lot and we ALWAYS put other's need before our own. But I have learned that when we do get angry it is typically out of our sense of injustice or the harming of someone we adore. We take fairness to an almost unreasonable level unless it comes to our own needs. I have found that when I am in a relationship that doesn't meet the needs that I still give to that relationship sacrificially but in the end, if my personal needs are never addressed I begin to feel unappreciated, unwanted, and unloved. Our anger, which typically takes a long time to build, is real, raw, and powerful, way too powerful. I sometimes, and I mean rarely, will get into a rage. Having said that, we as ENFJ's can achieve balance and harmony quicker if we learn to speak openly, instead of in coded messages that we have needs also. I have practiced walking away for years when I feel the rage coming. It does help. It gives me time to respond instead of reacting. Sleeplessness will cause this to be near impossible. Let the person know that you are wanting to talk about the problem or conflict but you need a few minutes to gather yourself so that you can think instead of feel. They WILL NOT understand. If they are not a feeler, they can't. Sensors have no idea of the turmoil you are dealing with and they will try to pursue you to get the problem solved. You must, MUST, give yourself time to get a grip on the emotions and then teach them that you are going to reflect the same emotions they have. Again, they will not understand. ENFJs are chameleons and will match the emotions of the ones we are at odds with. We cannot stop it or prevent it, but we can ask for a few minutes to try and process it. 
5	Age helps. Everything is more intense when you're young and controlling it is much more difficult.\n\nSecondly, once you're able to, start really considering your emotional state. Anger used to serve a purpose. It allowed us to conquer dangerous animals or overcome other dangers. \n\nThese days, it's not needed in the same capacity and more often creates more problems than it solves. What I do when I feel my anger rising is to mentally take myself out of the situation for a second.  I consider what's happening like I'm in 3rd person, observing from above. I then think about the situation in a more objective fashion, and it lets me make better decisions under stress. That little thing can save you from stupidity.\n\nLastly, I was taught something that took time to believe: we control our emotions. It's very easy to give in to them at times, but remember, you are giving into an impulse. Companies love impulse buys because they're often unnecessary and wouldn't happen with rational thought. Just as we learn to control those impulses, we can control the impulses that take us down the road to rage (any emotion, really). \n\nWhen you study strategy, a common tactic is to unnerve your foe. They play badly, make bad decisions, etc. Don't be your own foe. Control is an *extremely* useful skill. Hone it. You aren't "stuck" being this way or that...
4	i talk it out with my friends. it helps. bottling it up is very very very  unhealthy.  Learning when to pick your fights is also a good thing too.  So just vent when you have to.
4	I just talked to my best friend about this yesterday!\n\nNot sure if my experience is an ENFJ thing or just shitty experience but I have a really hard time even allowing myself to feel angry (when I should). I had a bit of a lightbulb moment while reflecting on my relationships with my parents and ex husband. With all of them I experienced a ton of gaslighting whenever I would get upset. So I think over time I became conditioned to just suppress anger because to express it would mean that the recipient would become MORE angry with me and turn the situation around. \n\nAnd my extreme people pleasing nature has spread that to every part of my life. I logically know that my real friends aren’t going to get mad at me for being upset with them, but my brain still forces anger down. It actually causes my best friend to get upset on my behalf because she wants me to be angry when I justifiably should be. But I just...can’t? At least not for longer than an hour or so, then I let it go.\n\nIn a lot of ways, it has helped me in life. I don’t start drama. I don’t get in fights. But I also sometimes feel scared to ever tell someone that they did something that hurt/upset me?
3	I gotta stop taking myself so seriously.
2	I don't consider myself an angry person at all but I'm very depressed. Depression is anger turned inward...so I bottle it up to the point where I don't know it's anger. I run from conflict if I don't think I can quickly solve it
4	Music Advice? Writing a Song for my ENFJ Mom	Hi guys, I'm an enfp looking to write a song for my enfj mom. At least, I think she's an enfj, she's never taken the test but from what I've read about you guys it suits her. Any suggestions on what might really touch her heart? I want her to feel loved and appreciated.
2	She will love anything that is heartfelt! I adore all things sappy, but that is probably just me. What a lovely thing to do for your mother!
1	To be honest I think that you just putting in the effort would be enough if I was your mom
13	I don't feel like I'm being taken seriously.	Not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this on, but I sometimes feel like people don't take what I say seriously. I get excited about things that intrest me, and tell people in my life about it and its like they don't even try to see what I see. I feel like I always make an effort to engage and understand what people are trying to explain to me, but I don't get the same treatment from them. I feel frustrated. I don't feel like I can say this to anyone either, because once again, they won't think much of it, but it really bothers me. Theh think I'm just being dramatic. Don't know if posting this will make me feel beter, but its worth a shot anyway. 
4	Have you ever thought that you may be speaking to the wrong people? Having an idea or a big picture of what you want to do is very important, not just to you but all the people that idea will impact. Believe me when I say you do have an impact. Without you many, many lives would change. Don't throw away your visions and dreams. Write them down and find a way to pursue them. You will eventually find the audience that thinks you are the bomb. 
3	Lizard Wizard...there is one person in this world who gets me, and four others who together get me.  It really is hard to find others who give a shit about the same things WITH THE SAME PASSION. That is the thing for me! Don’t despair, your filter is good 😃
2	This was something I dealt with a couple years ago. I really just focused on being more serious on other aspects of my life so they didn’t think I was the energetic outgoing guy 24/7. I would say “no” to certain things because I needed to study and work on things. Once I was seen as someone that was onto good things academically and professionally, it was easy to be balanced as the fun person with focused goals 
6	INFP in need of advice	First time posting here, ussually keep myself to r/infp in these matters, but in this dark hour I seek your help.\nI (21m infp) have started to like a wonderful enfj girl a year younger than me. That was at the very start of the holidays, we texted for hours, until about 5th January. Then she kind of started to respond less to my texts, like the conversation would flow before but now it just stalled. I directly asked if I said something wrong and she said no, but I didn’t get an answer to why we don’t talk like that anymore. I thought maybe that would change if we saw each other in person, but that seems impedingly difficult. What do you, as enfjs, think I should do?\n\nThanks in advance.
5	If you're down nothing wrong to offend her then I think maybe she's the one going through something, how about asking her how she's doing and wether everything's okay? ENFJs can feel pretty relieved after confiding in something that might be bothering them
2	I would ask a more specific question like "Has work been stressing you out?" 
21	Tired of being emotional lodestone	Classic content for this sub I know, but I needed to vent somewhere (plus maybe someone reading this can identify a little bit, and maybe it'll help them out too?)\n\nI'm tired of being the one who cleans up other people's emotional issues. I help because I'm good at it and because I do - genuinely - care and want to help, but it's that classic ENFJ thing of helping so much you suffer emotional burnout yourself.\n\nMy flatmate (and best friend of well over a decade) is in a catastrophic relationship which is making him - and her - miserable. Neither of them want to see this yet, because they're emotionally co-dependent, but they're not in love and this relationship is deeply unhealthy. He's an introvert who's struggled with relationships all his life (both romantic and platonic) and for a while this relationship was really helping him turn a corner in terms of mental health, but those days are long gone. I spend a lot of my time and emotional energy propping up his girlfriend who essentially plays the mother figure in his life (cooking, cleaning, doing his laundry etc); she dislikes many aspects of their relationship and is clearly unhappy, but she's so mentally unhealthy herself that she's become dependent on him just being there (even if they're a poor match). Since he's not great with relationships, communicating, or feelings, I take the brunt of her emotional stuff. I can do this to a degree, but when it starts to feel like I know her better than he does and she spends more time talking to me about how she feels than she does to him... that's problematic and I want to get out of that situation.\n\nMy other friend just broke up with his long-term girlfriend and I'm simultaneously supporting him through that. But the huge bulk of my emotional energy goes to supporting my girlfriend, who's a very complicated and amazing person for all sorts of reasons, but it takes a toll to support (and, tbh, understand) her too. Again, this isn't me grumbling about being there for important people in my life - I really care about these people and I want to help them to the fullest extent I can (all this sounds pretty prima donna and I'm sorry, but I'm venting).\n\nOn top of everything else, I'm currently going through a stressful and tumultuous time myself. I have a lot of goals of my own I want to achieve, and a lot of difficult choices to make: choices which will affect my life over the next few years. Some of these choices are personal, but some will impact people I care about - therefore I need to ensure I get things right.\n\nSometimes it's a lot of work just keeping yourself afloat without acting as the emotional lifeboat for others as well. I guess I'm tired of my own emotional support network not really being there (hence why I'm turning to the internet, and why this is all so self-centred and prima donna, haha). It all feels like one-way traffic emotionally to all these people, and being the one person everyone can turn to at any given time who is dependably calm, emotionally stable, and reasonably mature (yikes, this sentence sounds arrogant, apologies) takes a toll.\n\nThanks for sticking with my TED talk, sorry it's so long, just needed to get that out there.\n\n&#x200B;
14	Hey. \n\nYou are not self-centered or a prima donna. \n\nYou are a *limited* resource. \n\nUs ENFJs are so good at empathising and as you say, being the emotional lodestone for many of our relationships that we sometimes forget that we matter too. We're so good at emptying ourselves out that we sometimes forget that we deserve to also be filled. \n\nFirst thing I recommend you doing is to take a step back and prioritise. Which relationship should be your first priority to pour yourself into? Second thing you should do is immediately put in place a 'self-recovery' plan. What fills up your tank? \n\nFinally, as for your choices that you have to make, do remember to make those choices for YOU and, this is going to be hard because us ENFJs perceive this as selfish, but make the choice that would be the best for the betterment of YOU. Developing a well into a dam is not a selfish act. 
5	You've got every right to vent and this is an appropriate place to do it because a bunch of ENFJs will support you. I'm one of them and I relate to you 100%.\n\nThe helpful advice is you just simply have to learn to prioritize yourself enough that you don't get worn down like you are now; so that you have the energy to do what comes naturally without getting overwhelmed; so you don't end up feeling frustrated and bitter towards the people you love to help. \n\nI'm afraid that other people are not going to magically change and become the emotional support for you that you would be if you were in their position.. we are a type for a reason (other people aren't quite like us - which is a good thing, we need other types).\n\nWell, I want to write a few pages about this, but you probably could do it yourself in your sleep and I'm sure you've read it all before if you've hung around here...\n\nJust try to be a little bit more forgiving of yourself, don't expect others to become ENFJs - though your influence should be able to make them more noticeably more caring, take a time-out for yourself if you need to and do something just for you... etc.\n\nI know you'll be alright and back to your old self in no time.
2	I've had this issue come up many times and I've learned to kind of take a step back when I feel overwhelmed with other people's problems.  Don't hesitate to let your friends know that you can't really be emotionally supportive right now because you have stuff you need to take care of.  It may come across insensitive because most people feel like friends HAVE to always be emotionally available, but the fact is, you can't really be there for others if you're not there for yourself.  You have to preserve your mental health too and if that means you gotta disconnect for a bit, then so be it.  These problems are their problems, not yours.  You can't really control the situation and you can't really fix it either. 
1	Have you told them your insights of their relationship? \n\n\n\n
7	ENFJS understand me best	
17	Alone too much or not enough?	Hi!\n\nI'm an ENFJ who works in a Starbucks in the City. The company focuses so much on customer connection and making the moment count so I'm constantly pushing myself to go the extra mile for my customers. I've regulars who I will frequently chat too for long amounts of time about their problems and try offer advice or even just a person to talk too. My supervisors are fine with this and in fact, encourage it. I love my job and I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nMy problem is that outside of work I spend most of my time in my bedroom. With no college at the moment, I just don't have an excuse to go out at all. I've two housemates who I love to pieces but one is an introvert who works with people 40 hours a week so seldom leaves his room either and the other I work with, in Starbucks (me being a barista and him being a supervisor) He basically knows it as a rule now that I just want to be left alone when I get home cause I'm tired. \n\nI'm not sure if I'm pulling away from the people in my life because I'm tired and need time to recharge or if I'm caught in the trap of over thinking and upsetting myself so I'm pulling away and getting caught in the grip of Ti.\n\nAnyone else understands what I'm getting at and if so please help?!?\n\n&#x200B;
7	I have never related to something so strongly in my life as the OP and comments! \n\nI am mega strong E but have been having to turn down time with friends and even cut my amount of closer friends and acquaintances over the last year or so, I’m ashamed to say by turning down invites every now and then or ghosting basically. \n\nMy work is an extremely emotionally heavy advocacy type job  which I started 2.5 years ago and I think it’s taking its toll. I relate so strongly to the previous poster that said I can’t be ‘on’ for 14 hours. That’s honestly exactly how I feel.\n\nIn my 30’s the role I have carved out for myself within the friendship dynamic over the years is bloody tiring. I’m 100% on at work all day then in the evening I’m the advice giver or the shoulder to cry on which I do love, I’m good at it, but I’ve taken so much on emotionally I actually had really bad fatigue last year and had to take some sick days. \n\nThis year I’m trying to work out how to balance this - If I didn’t have that role within friendships, or this type of work I would be unhappier. I love it. But balancing it has all of a sudden become a challenge.\n\nI’m learning to not be too hard on myself if I can’t face an interaction and saving energy for the time I love - going to my local pub and out dancing of an evening. 
4	ENFJs unite....I feel like a terrible person sometimes for not hanging with friends, like at all. But then I remember how much energy it takes to hang with friends, it’s almost like I’m working and not getting paid for it. I can be extremely extroverted, like you, with my customers at work, but I am so drained from the day that all I can do is recharge at home, and if I don’t, it’s starts a spiral of exhaustion. Which is tough to get out of. Don’t feel bad for resting!! Maybe just make it a goal to go out once a month? Small, accomplished goals can also feel like big victories sometimes! 
4	It appears...you're putting on a show or hosting an event from the way you describe your interaction with your customers. That's how it is for me too when I was with my classmates. \n\nI wanted to have a good time with them, and would force myself to be interested in what they were interested in and talk about topics they enjoyed. Sometimes there is something to be learned from it, but it's so draining at other times--like I'm not really able to connect with them even though I am connecting with them. Or they are the ones being understood, but I'm not.\n\nWhat hurts even more is being alone. I don't meet people either because I've yet to find people I can be authentic with who wouldn't judge me over my authentic self--whilst being interested in the topics I raise in conversations. \n\nWhich is why I'm so very lucky to have a big family. I may not be talking a lot at times, but I just really want to have someone sitting by me when I'm doing something, or to be doing something with someone else. \n\nE.g. Going to the groceries alone can be sooo lonely. I can enjoy solitude sometimes, but going alone every time makes me feel miserable. And I'm really lucky my brother likes grocery shopping too, which means we get to go together very often. \n\ntldr, you could prod your roommates to spend time with them where you don't have to put on a show...but that also depends on how comfortable you are with them.
7	Oh no I’m the exact same way. I’m an ENFJ but I’m very introverted. I think that test confuses introvertedness with being antisocial, which is a common mistake. At school i can be the talk of the walk, I have very well relations with almost everyone but outside of school I spend all my time alone. I haven’t hung out with a friend in five years. don’t worry, as long as you enjoy it then it’s  no problem.
3	Try some other introvert stuff. I listen to, make, or play music. I like to paint as well, or watch some cool Movies. I also to find cool new books and read. Researching things is also fun, another form of learning.
3	This post and the comments legit feel like they've jumped out of my head onto a page in front of me! I have a very social and emotional driven job that I started recently. I live with my closest friends and boyfriend. \n\nAlmost every day after work, without fail, I go straight to my room and don't feel like talking to anyone except for my boyfriend (I feel like I'm introverting/recharging when I'm with my boyfriend which is really nice). When my weekends get taken up by events and catch ups with friends I feel sad because I feel like my time has been taken away from me. It's hard to stay socially active like this, but honestly I see it as self care. But of course, everything in moderation! Self care is also about pushing yourself outside of this and making those connections with the people in your life who are important to you.\n\nBut yeah. This post was just so relateable - I thought I was the only ENFJ that did this haha
3	I'm an ENFJ female and I can relate. \n\nSometimes you just need time for yourself away from a social setting. And if you've have expended that time and is ready to do something else then here is a few things I would suggest based on my personal experiences.\n\nI wanted to do something for myself so I started new hobbies that I would enjoy such as listening to podcasts, video games, meditation, or scrap booking. And if I wanted to do something out of the house, I'd either go watch a movie, go to dinner, or sit at the bar.\n\nI have friends that I enjoy spending time with, but only for a moment (of course I still check in with them to know that they are still important to me.) But overthinking can really control what is enjoyable in life for you. If it really gets to you, just plan a hangout with one of your housemates to be able to itch the "lonely" out of you. Relax and just continue doing what you want to do. 
2	This post is so timely! Next week, our company is getting us all together for a big conference. We work remotely and this is their way of building a common culture. Ironically, we read Howard Schultz book on Starbucks as one of our team building activities. The week will be packed with speakers, group exercises and at night, group functions. I am dreading it like I do every year because I find it all so exhausting! I can’t be “on” for 14 hours straight. I have always struggled to understand this because I am a very high “E” ENFJ. 
2	Absolutely relate.\n\nYou don't have to judge yourself for your recharge habits. I shamelessly binge reddit after a hard day. And oftentimes I *do* interact with people on it, like I am now :) Feeling like you don't want to do anything can be your body's way of asking for a break, especially with a taxing job in customer service.\n\nStill, if you're feeling in a rut, what helps me is to stop overthinking and just do something. Go to a new coffee shop. Read a new book. Watch a movie you've always wanted to watch. I'm big into movies and the Oscars, so this time of year is actually awesome for taking myself on dates to see the Oscars potentials. \n\n
1	I am totally ENFJ and I thrive on the interaction from work, I’m on the phone nearly all day. But at the end of the day, I REALLY enjoy my own company!  I’ve withdrawn a bit in the last few years, I no longer hang out with friends at every opportunity, I don’t need it so much anymore. But I do find myself on the phone a lot at home, listening to the problems and concerns of friends.\n\nIs it just me, or is anyone else on a call like this, at 11:30 at night, thinking, “I really need to get to sleep,” yet you listen and talk until after 12:30???
11	My experience lately	Everyone: “you really need to be more open with your feelings”\n\n......\n\nEveryone : “no, not like that”
4	People tell me I over share lol
3	Yup, that is why i don't open up anymore
1	Hahaha, don’t worry man I’m always really open with people. It gets kinda fun!
9	ENTP fell for an ENFJ - Need some insights on current limbo	I'm a 27M ENTP-A that met an 28F ENFJ and we both fell hard and fast for each other. It was only 2 weeks but I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with this person and she responded the same way - being super intimate and close to me. \n\n\nHowever we both have our share of issues that I suppose she saw coming. I lacked self-love and drive, I was still in my opinion in a rut/limbo despite having a huge multitude of friends and was living comfortably. Whereas for her, she was and always have been a driven person. We both came out of long term relationships (8 years). Mine was one that fell apart due to stagnating growth and I got over it quickly without too much pain. For her, she was basically trapped in a quick marriage with a person that constantly lied to and disappointed her, so she divorced - but due to her culture her family was very much against it so caused a rift. \n\n\nShe said that when she realised that she wasn't ready for a long-term relationship (she felt immense guilt and pressure from her family knowing she moved on so quickly - and they are coming to visit in February) but knew that I was emotionally ready, she didn't want to hurt me any more so suggested we stop dating. She also knew I wasn't ready given my lack of self love. She didn't want me to be blinded by opportunities if they came so she said to not wait for her as it will also give her pressure. It hurt more than anything I've ever felt, but it changed my life. For the next 2 weeks (and continuing now) I've learned so much about myself and now have something that I finally can use my constantly distracted brain to want to achieve. I've developed so many good habits that come naturally to me now and I genuinely feel purpose and self-love. Seems rapid, but it seemed to me like I was waiting my whole life for something like this.\n\n\nEven after we stopped, we continuously still talked and texted and called but I respected her wishes and obviously didn't breach the boundaries of being a good friend. It was starting to stress both of us out, though, as it was hard maintaining just a friendship without always wanting more. She specifically said that getting over me was multitudes harder than her ex-husband. So I suggested that we not talk to each other for exactly 30 days - to give her space and time to think which she appreciated but did not look forward to. She also mentioned that she was most hurt when I offhandedly said "I guess I could get over someone in like 2 weeks..." Even after I clarified that I meant that only if I knew they held no interest in me she still then felt like I would forget her in 2 weeks. She also felt that she would offer nothing in a platonic friendship given that I already have so many friends...\n\n\nWe're now in like Day 2 and she's already tagged me in an Instagram post (I guess since we aren't talking we aren't breaking the rule...?) and I've in turn liked some of her photos and we exchanged playlists for each other... I've also taken on the habit of journaling and in them I basically "talk" to her about my day, my insights from that day, and how I've gained in terms of self-love, vision, mindfulness etc. things that I did not have before. I want to give those entries to her at the end of our no-contact period (good idea?). I've been reading up on ENFJ's and how they hate the person that they like to lose interest and I definitely want to still show her that I'm interested in this period of "no-contact". \n\n\nIMO, I feel like she still is open to a relationship with me but she probably, given her experiences, is wary given the red flags both of us have. She even said if by the time she's 30 and we're both single and still friends then I would have her (not sure if that is good or bad?). I'm committed to waiting and improving myself as we just return to being normal friends. I don't think I'll ever forget her, and that's not with rose-tinted glasses. She made a lasting and life changing impact to me. \n\n\n**Sorry for the super long post guys... I just really want to know:**\n\n\n1) In this "no-contact" period, how do I show her that I'm still interested? If I keep doing things like liking her instagrams etc. will that violate my point that I was trying to give her space? \n\n\n2) In your experience, if ENFJ's do this, what should someone like me do to help? Was suggesting and implementing the no contact period a good idea?\n\n\n3) Any other or further insights would be much appreciated...
5	Hello! I'm sorry you're stuck in this back-and-forth--trying to respect boundaries while also (somehow?) conveying interest. That sounds stressful. I'll give you my perspective.\n\n**1) I don't think you can show interest *while* also being no-contact.** I know a lot of fellow ENFJ ladies, and I see this whole "We can't talk...except on Insta" thing as emotionally immature behavior. I used to do it, too. We can get in a place where we define our self-worth so much by attention from others (especially romantic) that we find all kinds of ways to rationalize continuing contact. But really, it's not healthy. Either we're feeding off attention for the wrong reasons, or we're anxious about losing access to attention when it's not even attention we want.\n\nI think it's healthiest for people to commit to a relationship, or commit to *not a relationship.* So if she asks for no-contact, you should ask her what she wants to get out of it, what it'll look like, when/if the no-contact ends, how will that go? Hash it all out. It will force her to commit to real behaviors--either giving you a clear picture, or letting you go.\n\n**2) I think no-contact is the right thing here since it seems like she needs to figure her shit out, but all the help you should give her is above--setting clear boundaries and sticking to them.** If she likes your Facebook photo, shoot her a private message to the tune of "Hey, I thought we agreed this type of contact isn't healthy for us right now?" and see if she can stick to her goals. This is about protecting yourself, too.\n\n**3) IMHO, I believe that emotionally healthy people who are good romantic partners don't continually jerk people around like your ENFJ is doing.** I cheated on a partner in a long-term relationship and used to be a huge flirt--even as I was dating my now-husband/getting ready to marry him. He finally told me how foolish it was for me to pretend that I was "just friends" with these men, and also how much it hurt him. I realized that my behavior was putting my relationship at risk--one that I truly cared about--and that I needed to grow the fuck up and fulfill myself vs. relying on others for self-worth. \n\nFortunately, I've been able to do that. One thing that's helped is the idea that women can "date" their friends. I've always gotten along better with dude than chicks (I'll blame being a tomboy daddy's girl) and part of that was the thrill of male-validation. Transferring my charm to female friends and "courting" them (taking them out to dinner, getting to know them, buying them gifts) is super fun and has given me healthy, meaningful friendships. I think ENFJs have an innate charisma and desire to be liked that needs to be vented. When those vents are healthy, our affability is a powerful tool (diplomacy, managing, teaching, coaching, Barack Obama is an ENFJ!, etc.) When those vents are unhealthy...well, that's why we can be unpopular in the MBTI community lol.\n\nAs to how much of this you can get your ENFJ to buy into, who knows. She probably won't love hearing my perspective on her behavior (ha) even if it's what I think she needs to hear. Good luck!\n\n 
3	Hmm...ENFJs tend to do this loyalty check (I can't speak for all of them). But she might also be pushing you away to see how much you'll chase after her/how much you want to be with her. It's definitely not a healthy behaviour, but she may not even be conscious of the fact that she's doing this. \n\nIn my honest opinion, if she likes you, she wouldn't want to be apart from you even for a minute. That would be so so soooo painful. \n\nWhy not get together with her and try to talk about your relationship with your friends or therapist? 
4	How do I stop doing this?	Today at lunch my friends and I were just talking while the general topic of relationships and future came up. In this conversation, I had 4 of my male friends tell me that beginning of our friendship and even now they thought I was flirting with them and was interested in them and they were confused because 3 of them felt the same way but didn't know what to do when they realized I talked to other girls the same way (I'm a straight female). I felt weird knowing that and didn't even know I was flirting because I thought I was just being super nice and friendly teasing them. And I want to know how I can stop doing that because now I'm getting conscious of the fact that more of my male friends probably think the same thing. Two of my friends even mentioned that this might be one of the reasons a relationship would be overwhelming with me because it would require too much patience and thinking, and it would create distrust or distance in the relationship. This was a hard pill to swallow so I am wondering if I can do anything to stop this because I am going to college soon and I really don't want this getting in the way of a potentially stable relationship. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso forgot to mention, one guy thought I was being manipulative to get attention because he realized "I was flirting with most of the guys", which obviously isn't the case and I didn't even know how to defend myself from that. 
3	"Friendly teasing".\n\nStop teasing and you'll be fine. 
3	You should just ignore those people. At the end of the day you know how you are when it comes to flirting vs being friendly. I have the same issue. I’m very friendly and I connect with people extremely well, it gets to the point where people think I actually like them in a more than a friend aspect. Whenever asked my intentions I make it clear that I’m not interested. No need to change who you are cause people can’t distinguish between the two. That’s their fault not yours. So never feel bad for that. They are just salty cause the feelings aren’t mutual. I guarantee you once you’re in a relationship or you find yourself attracted  to someone you’ll notice a huge difference in the being overly friendly with someone you like vs being really friendly with friends. Your friends will notice too and they’ll soon realize that you weren’t interested in them. No need to change. 
3	Don’t change. It’s something we ENFJs do at times, but you’ll be much happier being you...AND the right guy is going to know that you’re not flirting with everyone. 😃
2	Yea keep doing you. I do the same and I have plenty of friends who get me as I am. My fiance and I trust each other as well and it's never come up because we communicate well. You can't really change how others think of you but you can change how you think of others. Changing yourself to fit the mold is never the way to go as you'll be unhappy and repressed. If people don't take you as you are then it's their problem. 
1	I do the same exact thing, and people have always thought I was gay because of it. Honestly, I wouldn’t change it if I were you. It works to get people to like you quickly and is overall worth it. If they have a problem with it, they’re useless. Just remember, they’re all expendable. Friends are easy to replace, and good friends(only friends worth having) won’t hold this type of thing against you. 
43	Very emotional	Do you guys also feel like you leak so much emotion. Its impossible to keep my emotions to myself, and I have always felt like I need to hold back on it so I don't irritate other people.  When ever I think to myself, ok I'm going to let this emotion slide its not a big deal, I end up talking about it or showing it, and only there after I feel much much better. Its like I HAVE TO. Do you guys relate and how do you deal with being overly emotional? 
23	Yeah, I can relate, I also feel like I have to at least mention it. I know for some people it may seem like I'm complaining, but I just need to express how I'm feeling. When I don't, I tend to overthink and it can lead me to feeling down. 
6	Journaling gives me a way to be embarrassingly and obnoxiously emotional. It feels like it helps me breathe again. 
6	Whether fortunately or unfortunately ENFJs are very emotional. It is the way our empathetic radar works. It is the way our compassion radar works. We feel. Because we are so very emotional we have a gift for seeing into the souls of others and can intuit what is going on in their hearts. I know what you mean when you elude to the overwhelmingness of all the emotions we feel. As for "leaking emotion" No. I have learned to hide my feelings from those who don't have a heart connection to me. And for those who are connected to me, I let it pour out when I feel like they truly accept me for who I am. My advice, don't bury your emotions. I have learned through my years of feeling neglected and detached that I need to feel what I feel. 
3	Yes, like it needs to come out, it just has too. 
4	All the time ..
2	I feel like I have a lot of emotions bottled deep inside but I rarely ever show it. I don’t like to feel exposed or vulnerable. I know showing emotions doesn’t mean your weak it’s perfectly normal but I just can’t seem to let it out. I rarely ever cry and if I do I do this weird thing where I’ll break down for a good 15 seconds and right when those seconds are done I go back to normal like nothing happened.  
2	Don't beat yourself up too hard over who you are which is probably an extroverted thinker. We do think aloud especially about situations that are important to us and emotional. I think opening up to the right people you trust and being more selective about who you have those conversations with will make you feel more secure about wanting to talk with others.
2	I can relate. It's tough to control my emotions for me so lately I have been trying to train myself to refrain from what I want to express.\n\nI feel that I have some insecurities so I've been watching tons of "How To Control Your Emotions" and improvement videos on Youtube to try and honestly, they work. When I feel like I'm about to express a negative emotion, I step back, take a deep breath, and think about my outcome first. \n\nFor example, since I work in the restaurant industry. "Yes, it sucks that I got tipped poorly, but at the end of the night I'm still going to leave this place with more money then I went into."
1	I’m emotional and I feel things very deeply but since I am stunted with my emotions, I don’t always know how to express them. I do enjoy letting my thoughts out no matter what the situation is because I think it’s not good for us to hold it in. However, this isn’t always the case because I do have to analyze the situation to see if it’s advantageous enough to even express what I’m feeling. Many times, I’m level headed and don’t want to get too carried away with my emotions, specially when I see how others express them and get carried away by one relative emotion that they happen to be feeling in that moment. However, I’ve learned that emotions are not a crutch as I once used to think they were, but they can be such a vital tool to fulfill goals and to know how the other is thinking or feeling. I use to be much more cold and shut off, but now that I am reaching my mid 20s, I think I am starting to get a grasp on them. That’s probably not the case and I’m probably just deluding myself into thinking I have more mastery over my emotions but I am in a much better emotional place and I used to be. I’ve really come to respect my emotions and also that of others. I think may ENTJs are highly emotional, I’ve observed this in the women more than men. But I think both genders are passionate and driven by an emotion they either didn’t want to feel again or one that they try to emulate because they felt it only a handful of times. 
1	100% relatable. I’m a very emotional yet stable person! Yet aren’t we all.
1	Fe is about expressing both positive and negative emotions openly.
1	If I'm feeling intensely about something and I know it may not be socially appropriate to express it towards a certain group of people, I wouldn't be able to hold back on bursting out about it in another place. I will rage where it's fine to rage. 
11	Any other ENFJs struggle with codependency?	I think a lot of what makes us unique seems to line up with codependency. I want to maintain my identity and LOVE being an ENFJ, but I also want to be healthier and let go of my codependency issues. Anyone have any advice / come to the same conclusion? 
6	Just a question but is it possible you are using the wrong word.  Codependency is defined as a psychological condition or a relationship in which a person is controlled or manipulated by another who is affected with a pathological condition (such as an addiction to alcohol or heroin). I have never been codependent. Do I obsess in my relationships? Yes, to a fault. I am an all or nothing kinda of person. I am all in or not at all. 
3	I feel like we naturally are codependent but what helped me is just think about it a lot. Understand why you feel the way you do, then find ways to do the opposite, like fixing a bent ruler. Just bend it the other way till it’s straight. That’s what I did anyway.
3	Boundaries.  That's the key word.  Being codependent is defined as follows\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Codependency** is characterized by a person belonging to a dysfunctional, one-sided relationship where one person relies on **the** other for meeting nearly all of **their** emotional and self-esteem needs \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo to get to the point of codependency you need to be in a form of relationship, which includes with friends, families and sig others.  You need to understand their boundaries and solely rely on one single person to dump your feelings or get your happiness from.  You can divide your attention across several people and it'll help mitigate your codependency and won't burden others as much.  Overall though, codependency stems from insecurity and immaturity.  So if you work on yourself and improve your ability to self love, then you don't got to worry about codependency. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nExamples would include, say if your friend or sig other wants to hang out with other people but not include you.  You need to be ok with that and not give them a hard time.  Don't take this personally because other people have friends too and you don't need to always stick to them like glue when they want to spend quality time with other people.  Respecting peoples space and privacy is extremely important.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeing able to internally validate and affirm yourself helps a ton.  Right now, my fiance is cat sitting for his sister for two weeks.  I miss him terribly after two days, but we chat a few times in the day and he comes home to see me for a couple hours about 2x a week.  Even though I really enjoy his company, I'm ok with him doing his own thing while I do my own.  Sometimes I forget to respond to him when I'm playing my video games or watching a movie.  Same thing happens for when he goes out to dinner with his friends.  This is completely healthy and I consider myself a very needy person.  \n\n&#x200B;
2	It is what it is sadly. It’s who we are :/ sucks when we don’t have anyone but don’t try to change 
3	Bryan Dechart (the actor who plays Connor in Detroit: Become Human) and his girlfriend Amelia Rose Blaire are just the perfect ENFP couple! What do you ENFJs think about them?	Hey  guys! That's actually a cross-post from [/r/ENFP](https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP), but I thought that you might be interested in that one, too!\n\nI  was just curious about hearing your opinion on that topic, and was so  glad that my sister introduced me to this game a couple of weeks ago.\n\nMaybe  some of you were already  fortunate enough to dive into this  masterpiece of a game (if not, and  you have a PS4, definitely do it!)  and did also watch Bryan's and Amelia's gameplay of their own characters in the game.\n\nI've just  watched a video of them and am just so certain that both of them are ENFPs in real life! Perhaps I've missed something, what do you think?  If you had to type both of them based on this video, what would you say? Could they be be INFP/INFJ/ENFJ, too?\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GXzBeAs4Wc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GXzBeAs4Wc)\n\nEnjoy your day, folks. Cheers! :)
3	Impossible to know how or who a person is over a video. That’s them acting, or at least could be. \nI wouldn’t look at youtubers or actors in some limelight. 
4	Manic Pixie gone mad	quickly connected with enfj.  intensely interested and he seemed to be, as well.  he has 2 children (divorced) and runs a bunch of successful businesses with one being at a stage requiring an immense amount of time investment on his end as the founder and those demands I understand quite well due to my profession.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhe made huge efforts to see me initially and we saw each other 6 of 7 days after the first date.  i of course, being an enfp, fell increasingly more smitten and enamored by the second & it was going really well for about 3 weeks..  recently (since New Year'sish), the communication seemed distant - i finally allowed my head into this love affair and she over analyzed everything and then said that i wasnt feeling reciprocated enthusiasm and she then placed an expectation on the enfj to confirm if he was actually into me and interested.  ENFJ said he was enjoying seeing how things evolved and concerned he is not able to deliver what i am looking for at the moment and at this moment the demands on him seem endless.    He also mentioned that my openness and vulnerability is a really good thing and he was glad I was sharing those feelings.  He said he struggles in a major way with the idea that he is bringing pain or conflict to anyone's life.  He said he usually ends relationships early for this reason but that he realizes his system is flawed because to experience a real connection, one must experience pain and of some sort along the way.  He also remained in a marriage for a long time that was unfulfilling and is looking to experience a really deep connection with someone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nso, we agreed to stop talking because I expressed that I needed him to communicate more and he said he was unsure about how he was feeling and what he was capable of at the moment but that just that day he was thinking to himself multiple times when would he see me again.  So, I feel like I just screwed it all up.  I can not seem to manage remaining cool when I experience deep connection with someone, I become super fearful and it's really unfair how I handled that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy question is do you think that he actually was  losing interest if the communication changed?  I apologized to him for wrongly and selfishly asking him to participate in the management of my emotions and said that I hoped he would connect again if it made sense in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you think there is any sign here that he may do that or perhaps that maybe he really wasn't all that interested and I should just stop thinking about it and him?  I'm so mad at myself, I really feel that we would make a great team in so many ways including romantically and I was frankly enamored by him which doesn't happen often for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy must you people be so magnetic?
7	I am a great and feely communicator, but not when I have worldly stresses, so that’s really hard. I “feel” like this is why his communication style may have changed. Learn from this and I hope he reaches out to you because it makes sense 😃
3	You can and will find another to be enamored with. \nI, as an enfj, can’t leave whoever I have feelings for alone. So he may have just been losing interest or just not putting what was/could have been as a bigger priority like you were/wanting him to do.\n\nDoes suck, unrequited things, but you weren’t married so don’t get too down. Plenty of other awesome folk out there! 
2	>Why must you people be so magnetic?\n\nIkr?! 
2	he sounds exactly enfj. we do speak the truth as best we can i believe so i think you should take him for what he is. if your heart is set on him then i think you should be true to it and wait patiently while you still hold those feelings. if you feel a strong need to be the center of his attention at all times then i think you should consider looking elsewhere if you can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsorry, if i knew personality typing better then i could add it up better for you what you should probably do based on your type. of course, those are just guidelines in the end... you gotta make up your mind. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nthere's no shortage of lovable people out there if you have to move on. good luck\~\~
1	I can't speak for all people, but I'm needy because of how forgetful I can be. I need that constant reminder that someone likes me. I also am not aware that I can be feeling a certain way sometimes because of how I'm so outwardly focused, I forget to go back inside my mind to introspect. I would say it's a good idea that he's now getting the time to figure out what he's feeling. However, don't leave him be for too long.
14	Nervous for interview	Hey guys,\n\nI have my first "real-world" interview for an entry level engineering job (I just graduated). I'm pretty nervous; what do you think makes ENFJs shine in interviews? \n\nJust looking to feel a little less nervous. Thanks everyone :)
9	Lol its the confidence, the eye contact and the way we are swift with answers when questioned. You got this!! I know you’re nervous but just breathe and don’t overthink it. Don’t get forgot to give a update about the interview. Best of luck!!! 
5	*beep beep* Hi, I'm JobsHelperBot, your friendly neighborhood jobs helper bot! My job in life is to help you with your job search but I'm just 476.9 days old and I'm still learning, so please tell me if I screw up. *boop*\n\nIt looks like you're asking about interview advice. But, I'm only ~27% sure of this. Let me know if I'm wrong!\n\nHave you checked out CollegeGrad, HuffPo, LiveCareer, etc.? They've got some great resources:\n\n* https://collegegrad.com/jobsearch/mastering-the-interview/the-eight-types-of-interview-questions\n* http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rana-campbell/10-ways-to-rock-your-next_b_5698793.html\n* https://www.livecareer.com/quintessential/job-interview-tips\n* http://people.com/celebrity/worst-job-interview-answers-askreddit-answers/\n* https://www.thebalance.com/questions-to-ask-in-a-job-interview-2061205
3	You ENFJs have an amazing enthusiasm that is hard to fake. I think you'd be surprised at how well eagerness comes across in interviews, especially when it's for an entry level position. \n\nGood luck \^-^
2	Neo961. \n\nDo you want this specific job? Do you want to work for this specific company?\n\nIf the answers are yes, your nervousness may lean towards “what if i dont answer questions correctly, what if i say the wrong things, and ultimately dont get the job”. If so, do your best to stop the negative thoughts. You’re here to help others (thats what ENFJs do, right?) and that’s why this company should hire you.\nIF you DONT get the job, it’s THEIR loss not yours. You move on to the next interview, whereas the company will probably not get a second shot at hiring you.\n\nDont be cocky, but be confident. You are the best even though nobody knows it YET.\nDont let your anxious thoughts get in the way. I know it’s easier said than done.\nIf the answers to my first questions are truly yes, your enthusiasm will naturally show and you’ll do great. Treat it like you’re talking to your teachers. \n\nGood luck to you. 
2	ENFJ’s have a charisma and selflessness that is hard to fake so that will definitely show in your character! Remember with behavioral interview questions to worry less about the perfect answer and more about the story (mistakes and adaptability show growth). But overall, don’t be nervous you are likely a natural leader and you can do it!! Good luck :) you got this.
2	I'm never not nervous for an interview.  The key thing is to be prepared for it and practice practice practice.  Do research on the company, be prepared to ask questions to show interest, and practice answering common interview questions.  Honestly the first few interviews may not go well, but the more you do them, the more prepared you'll be.  Remember there's no shame in not passing the interview.  Every failure is more experience for you.
1	It’s the genuine enthusiasm and sincerity we hold in conversation. I’ve noticed how we are able to bring a likability that people aren’t too familiar with and since it is genuine, it is a breath of fresh air for many. \n\nWe own every space we’re a part of and have a light that reaches many. Smile, give a firm handshake, and the charismatic magic runs from there. Good luck friend!
1	Your passion is palpable 
17	ENFJ movies/TV shows/books etc	Please share good movies, youtube links, books etc you think ENFJs enjoy more than non-ENFJs.\n\nThank you. 
14	I think the dude in "You" on netflix is a very badly damaged ENFJ. 
10	- Mad Men (TV)\n- My Hero Academia (TV)\n- Master of None (TV)\n- Your Name (Movie)\n- The Dark Knight (Movie)\n- Interstellar (Movie)\n- Man of Steel (Movie)
5	I think Ashitaka in Princess Mononoke is one of the most relatable characters to me personally that I’ve ever seen put to film. And I don’t truly relate to characters often, so I think that makes it a must-watch. \n\nI’d be interested to see if anyone’s else responses to this question are based on a CHARACTER specifically that they feel is relatable to ENFJs too.
5	I loved La La Land
3	I'm an ENFJ and my preference is definitely a dark, peculiar taste.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal's Movies\n\nTim Burton Movies\n\nChildren of Men (Movie)\n\nHow I Met Your Mother (series)\n\nMirai Nikki (Animated series)\n\n&#x200B;
2	Death Parade -anime\n\nI just seem to love watching the unfolding of many complex layers of emotions people feel and the thoughts they go through. I never think people are as simple as just one ____ emotion. The emotions they choose to express or behaviour they show can always be linked back to a long mental-thought-process of a journey. The anime above is capable of narrating this. What made me squirm with excitement was how the characters may appear to act or be a certain way at first, but as the story progresses, a dark and sinister side is drawn out, however the viewer is also able to realise that the evil side of the characters is also quiet innocent and pure at its origins...\nDo other ENFJs feel the same way? 
2	-The office (of course)\n-My Hero Academia\n-Gintama\n\nAll of these shows especially the first and the last are about how a group of people got to become really good friends.
1	While You Were Sleeping (Movie)— I think Lucy is an ENFJ. \n\nElizabethtown (Movie)— I feel like Claire in that movie is an ENFJ. \n\n
1	'Company' by Stephen Sondheim (musical).\n\nI strongly believe that the main character Robert is an ENFJ; an unhealthy variety. The layers and layers of unspoken relationships makes this a really good watch for Fe/Ni users.\n\nThe 2011 revival can be found on YouTube, with Neil Patrick Harris as the Robert. Also featuring: Stephan Colbert, Jon Cryer, Christina Hendricks, Martha Plimpton and Patti LuPone :)\n
1	The Marvelous Mrs Maisel on Amazon 
1	My favorite Movies/ Shows:\n\nAmerican Psycho\nHeathers \nDark Knight\nMeet the Robinsons\nThe Fault in our Stars\nLove, Simon\nMe Before You\nDexter\nHow to get away with murder \nNarcos\nBlack Mirror\nAmerican Horror Story \nPretty little liars \nRevenge\nYOU\nWeeds \nElite \nThe Vampire Diaries \nGossip Girl\n
1	I usually enjoy shows about relationships/friendships and the drama that revolves around that. Here are some favs:\n\nSo I've seen all of Friends, HIMYM etc.\n\nSex Education is really good, I just finished it. Give it a watch!\n\nThis is us is still on going and its very well-written\n\nJane the virgin is great💜\n\nI really loved Anne with an E as well\n\n\nTry to watch the Before trilogy if you can; the first film is called Before Sunrise. If you're not into slow-paced movies it may be harder to watch, but as a fellow ENFJ I loved it. The movie captures the connection of two people meeting for the first time very well. The movie is carried by it's dialogue, it's beautiful :) \nIf this interest you, give it a shot!
16	Female ENFJ here- hit me with some questions!	I saw a male ENFJ doing it, so I thought I'd do a female one! I don't mind being asked personal questions, so go ahead. \n\n&#x200B;
10	INFJ here. Male. I have an ENFJ as my SO. She is just alien to the concept of self love. I understand it can be an issue for you guys. But I'm just always so afraid to bring this topic up. I love her to pieces and I always try my best to be there for her.\n\nBut on the other hand, being an introvert, I don't get enough recharging time that I need whenever she's around because she always wants to spend time with me. Sure, if I act a bit distant in the slightest or we're having a disagreement and I'm quiet, she'll give me this offended, "So I guess you wanna be left alone then..." and I'm like, "NO! I want to be but not for the wrong reasons like you're making them out to be!" I mean, I am madly in love with her, but she needs to learn to love herself enough to be able to spend time with herself without her mind bringing her down telling her things like, "No one likes you, you're a piece of shit, etc. etc.". Being an INFJ, I, personally, know self-love. I have no issues being alone with myself for hours, or even days, on end. But, everytime I leave HER by herself, it eats at me that she's gonna burst into tears and harm herself. I'm afraid of leaving her alone because of her lack of self-esteem and self-love. The classic ENFJ tendency of listening to sad songs when you're feeling down (totally counter-productive btw) doesn't help the case much either. \n\nHow do I bring it up in a manner that doesn't offend her and then fix this?
6	Is your "need" to help others genuine or just a way to assert yourself and become important in other people's lives? 
8	Where can I find you silly muffins so I can put a ring on you
4	Where do I find more of you? Seriously it's like the best type to date but everyones taken. 
1	If you notice that a building is about to collapse, and the people in it will die, what would you do?\nIn the circumstance that they don't believe nor heed your warning, how would you react?
1	How so you know you're not an ESFJ?
1	How do you do to make people confortable and easy around you?
1	What would life be like for you if you had to live with only your partner and couldn't be around anyone else?\n\nCould you live with just one other person in your life and no friends or random stranger interaction?
1	Ever dated a ENFP dude? Currently I am seeing an ENFJ girl. She is a lot younger than me but there is no behaviour that show that. Man do I dig that ENFJ. Its for the first time that I can have deep long conversations about life love and art. Seems she understands and likes the child in me and my goofy side.\n\nIs it normal for an ENFJ to be so picky on a partner? We are writing everyday and we kissed and spend a night. We are heavily attracted to each other but she holds me on a distance. \nShe is not healthy and has lots of problems to deal with and I am totally in love with the imperfectly perfect being she is.\n\nSo I decided to in fact stay on a distance of the fire and let our intimacy grow.\n\nI feel she might be the one so worth fighting for ;)\n
2	How did you pick a careeer/ major in College ?	Hi guys\n\nso I just wanted to know which criteria you guys had when you picked a career. \nDid you want an office job, or be able to travel; what were the things you must had or absolutely didn't want in a job ?\n\nThanks :)
6	I just want a family. The career path was pretty much picking a straw. Nothing life fulfilling 
5	I’d just say find something you’d love to do then try to be it!! For example if you love kids, you could be a teacher, if you love helping people, a nurse or doctor, either way good luck!!
3	Apply the igikai chart to your options
3	I wanted to work in science or healthcare, not too many nights or weekends, easily be part time to work around children, ideally with people and not at a computer or office all day. \n\nI chose physiotherapy :) 
2	I never did and my parents basically choose accounting for me and I hate it and i regret it.  Just pick something atleast.  Don't be like me. 
2	Make a list of everything you want from a job, then write down a list of jobs/majors you want, then see which ones meet all the requirements of what you want. I’m not in college yet but I’m very very certain what I want to be.
2	I can't speak for all ENFJs but all the jobs I ever considered were helping jobs or jobs wherein I thought I could raise others to a higher level. 
28	A Love Letter to ENFJs from ISFP	After a recent dispute with an ENFJ, I had a really vivid and strange dream about another ENFJ who lives next door to me. What it all meant continues to blow my socks off and probably will for a while. I hope this story will give ENFJs some insight and understanding of how much we appreciate them.\n\nThe dream begins in a grocery store when Facebook pings me her birthday notification, so I pick out the biggest cupcake I see to give. She and I don’t really talk that much in real life because we’re in different circles, but I remember last year when she sat next to me in class she really tried to be my friend. Because I often didn’t physically do anything to show my appreciation,  I didn't appear like I wanted to be hers, but honestly, I was very touched. Much more than I, and she, realized at the time.\n\nI walked up to her door and knocked, my friends promptly laughed at my sappiness and started walking away. I froze for a few seconds, before running back to my friends, realizing the foolishness of the situation.\n\nRunning away, she finally opens the door and yells out, "why would you do this?". Rightfully assuming I was “ding-dong ditching” her, and clearly hurt by it.\n\nI immediately stop trying to run after my "friends" and give her the explanation she deserved. Realizing how the only foolishness lies in not doing something I want to do because of how I will be seen. Life’s too short for that and let’s be honest, giving someone a cupcake is not the most awkward thing you can do.\n\nI see that it makes ENFJs really sad when people don’t look like they want to be their friend as much as they do, that makes me pretty sad because I feel the same way a lot of the time, but I don’t express this willingness nearly as well as they do. ENFJs are the bravest people I have ever met for putting themselves out there like that, and it inspires me to do the same.\n\nIf you’ve ever touched an SFP with some simple gestures or even just advice, know that deep down they *love* you for it.  ISFPs love for a friend or even just an acquaintance is actually really damn intense, sometimes they are worried about exposing these feelings because it’s very easy to get hurt. Especially when you're a male and it doesn’t fit what society deems the right way to be is.\n\nI [once read](http://www.wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=EIE_Profile_by_Gulenko) that Fe is pretty objective and notices a lot of inconsistency with what people say and do, and it seems like that is how they are often judging other's emotions. Idleness is an unfortunate vice of the ISFP, but I think a negative relation is often assumed too much between us.  Ultimately it's on us to make others think about how we feel, as much as you make others realize its on them to understand how what you think makes others feel.\n\nYou make people realize that all the love in the world can be in vain without action, you embody this ideal the strongest out of any type. I only wish that people didn’t have to feel the dread of not knowing where they stand with people, and I think NJs , particularly ENFJs, are hurt the most by this. In this sense they really are *the* victims of society, they put themselves out there and other people have opinions about it, but sometimes the *other people* are unnecessarily harsh out of resentment for their own desire to put themselves out there.\n\nKnow that there exists an unperturbable and all-pervading love in Fi that loves you no matter how much you give or don’t give to it. It loves you for what you are and it always will, and you do deserve that love as much as you know in your heart that other people do.\n\nI hope someone buys you the biggest motherfucking cupcake on the shelf for your birthday. Don't flatter yourself too hard though, I love everyone.\n\n\-L\n\n[http://www.talkingtype.net/2019/01/05/a-love-letter-to-enfjs/](http://www.talkingtype.net/2019/01/05/a-love-letter-to-enfjs/)
4	Thank you for this. My best friend and soul sister was an ISFP. I miss her everyday (she passed away). I felt she understood me and accepted me best. She was also the only one who wanted to protect me where everyone else looked at me to protect them. \n\nYour insights how you see your ENFJ friend help me see why.
5	Aww now I want a cupcake. 
1	Well I’ve decided to flatter myself immensely with this and there’s nothing you can do about it. 😂
1	Speaking truth. 
16	Strong selfish feelings	Do you guys ever feel strong selfish feelings like you NEED things done your way sometimes and then later look back and want to die over why you did that or is it just me?
10	Sometimes you socially know best for the best outcome for peak happiness for all parties involved. Others don’t see it
10	Absolutely. My [35F] advice is to take more time to pause and think when you feel emotional and potentially selfish. Stop talking, stop your actions, stop writing that email, etc. and take a few hours to a day to think before you speak or act in a way you may regret. Even if you do see the benefit to the parties involved if the situation goes your way and even if you are correct, it will not always go your way. Be okay with not always having control of outcomes. I think the hardest part of understanding how to act less selfishly is being more aware and more often in control of our sometimes unruly emotions and being willing to let go when your influence ends. As I have gotten older this process makes more sense and I have less of these selfish moments that I cannot take back. 
4	You’re not alone..
3	My life is a constant struggle between not feeling like that too much and at the same time learning to communicate it in a nice way. 
3	Yes..
3	I don't really ever regret...\nBut I do wonder why some people just agree with me like that. pffahahaha\n\nBut sometimes I do wish that I hadn't gotten into some of the fights that I've had. If only I could be smarter and not give my attention to people who want to pick a silly fights with me.
2	I think plenty people can relate. I find myself being the opposite. I feel like I’m not selfish enough and people take advantage of that. 
2	All the time, it seems I let my feelings get in the way when I make selfish decisions and when I look back I feel really bad for acting like that. I try to calm myself down, but oh my gosh feelings of anger are overwhelming sometimes and I make terrible decisions. We can all become better though!
5	ENFJ or ESFJ	Hi There,\n\nI've been researching MBTI for around 6 months now and have always identified as an ENFJ. However, I've started thinking that I might be an ESFJ. My best friend (an ISTP) and I have been trying to figure it out now for a while and we seem to be getting nowhere. If I'm honest Intuitive versus Sensory has always confused me so I have no idea how to figure it out.\n\nFrom what I do understand the difference between the two has to do with memory, future thinking versus past thinking. I do have a very good long-term memory. Every song I listen to and every place I've been has a memory attached and I love to reminisce on old times. I also love to daydream about the future and this I will do and the experience I will have with the people in my life.  \n\nI've also been told the difference is intuitive thinkers are abstract thinkers who love talking about idea and theories while sensory thinkers more in the physical world and enjoy more talking about the here and now. I've been told that sensors are good with there hands and enjoy more activities based in the real world. I'm in theatre and spend my days in college discussing the importance of the arts. We regularly discuss the deeper meaning behind plays and love to dive deep into the meaning of gender, sexuality, politics, and morals in these plays. I love to think but what if? \n\nOn the other hand, though, I've always had a love for camping, and engines and even now in college I love my theatre tec classes. I love having the mechanics of these things explained to me and figuring out how they work.  \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is I'm a big mess of idea and I don't know how to un-muddle them.\n\nI'd appreciate any help you guys can give me!\n\nThank you! 
6	My Ni is hyperactive. \nSo much so that I can finish peoples sentences when they have a few words in. Or I get very impatient when listening to someone to know the moral of their story, and once I get it I press down the urge to leave because everything's figured out in my head. I also feel extreme discomfort when reading a prose written fully in present tense because it feels unnatural to me to be experiencing things in the moment...I'd much rather it be in omniscient. The trickiest side to it is assigning a hypothetical intention to every action/expression/word some one does or says because they must have a reason for doing so. \n\n*E.g. She had x micro-expression, she is feeling a certain way about x.*\n\nI don't even do this consciously...it's on autopilot.\n\nMaybe you can measure yourself against this scale to see how much your Ni leads you vs Si/Se(?)
4	The MBTI system is pretty fluid. It happens from time to time that someone would be cathegorized as one type but identify more with another.\n\nPerhaps you are simply very close to the middle of the S/F scale.
21	ENFJ Poetry (please share yours too)	I'd like to see if this resonates with my fellow enfjs! Please share yours too! \n\n\n\nI am a ball of flame that flickers,\nflickers erratically, wildly, unpredictably.\n\na flower that blooms too quickly,\nand grows beyond what its ground can hold.\n\na caged beast greedy for unrestrained freedom,\nbut chains itself and bleeds from it.\n\nThere's too many words to say but I don't have enough to really say it all.\n\nBurn with me\nso that my fire never dies out.\n\nDrown me with a lake,\nI can never have enough.\n\nLiberate me from myself,\nand let us run uninhibited into oblivion.\n
3	Our love emerged from the depths \nof the Dead Sea. On the beach we resided \nto finally breathe each other once again.\nI had a closed mind and muffled thoughts\nto temporarily fool myself \ninto believing that our forever \ndidn't have a date of destruction.  \nToo quick I was  \nto build our sandcastle.  \nI did not heed the warnings of  \nour surroundings, for\nthey didn't know the power of us.  \nWhen the tide came in, \nour sandcastle fell \nas quickly as the Roman Empire. \nWhat once was us is now \nindividual pieces of sand \nmixed in with the sadness of the world.  \nI've learned my lesson; I know my limits. \nBut when it comes to us, I will \ndampen my senses and make \nthe same mistakes over, and over again, \ngrasping onto the hope for  \na different outcome.

1	 \n\nMy thoughts are beautiful\n\nThey depict\n\nThe things that would make your imagination sparkle\n\nThings that would lead your eyes to dance\n\nMy thoughts would form a ground for the world to dance on\n\nA floor that would be worthy of your attention\n\nThey would plant an action on top of it that would take precedence over anything else\n\nAn experience, enthralling\n\nA dancer with form unlike any other, with an aura drawing around her\n\nTracing her beautiful moves through the air\n\nBright lights of neon blue tracing after her elegant sweeps of her arms\n\nAs if they were trying to chase her being\n\nHot bursts of fiery red would form after her leaps\n\nShowing her desires in full\n\nThis is her.\n\nHer landings would be patches of sprouted ice\n\nPristine in every way\n\nMy thoughts could perform the perfect ballad to follow her\n\nThe kicks kicking high upon her emotions\n\nFollowing her, working in tandem with her soul\n\nWatching her move as the song followed\n\nAs if it were an onlooker, staring in awe\n\nCategorizing every arch. Every bit of momentum from her performance\n\nAttaching itself to something within, \n\nItself helplessly intertwined into her moments\n\nAnd upon this pristine floor, on this pristine stage, with this perfect dancer unlike anything that you could ever imagine, with a song piercing softly into yours and every other heart within the room\n\nIs me.\n\nThere is no room\n\nNo perfect dancer\n\nNo enthralling Ballad\n\nJust me\n\nWishing to create\n\nAn unforgettable scene of neon Sparks and brilliant flames within you\n\nJust me wanting to watch your emotions unfold as you draw yourself into the scene\n\nAs you allow it to touch your soul\n\nTheres just me, and that's all I wish to create
1	I met a girl once\n\nShe used a mask of herself\n\nDay to day\n\nI'd see her, masked and laughing\n\nBut Dying\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI got to meet a girl once\n\nWho used to use a mask\n\nNow though\n\nShe shows herself to me\n\nAnd she's shattered\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI loved a girl once\n\nWho didn't love much about life\n\nShe spoke to me about everything\n\nBut I ran into a wall\n\nThat she loved to hide behind\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've known a girl now\n\nWho is afraid of life\n\nShe keeps crawling away\n\nAway from me\n\nWe still talk everyday\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI talked to a girl today\n\nWho still hides behind her wall\n\nI told her everything that she already knew\n\nAnd she smiled behind her wall\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI cried about a girl today\n\nWho tried to find a place to escape to\n\nBut she couldn't find it on Earth\n\nSo she tried elsewhere\n\nAway from here\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI stood face to face to a wall today\n\nAnd watched my friend who I used to know walk around behind it\n\nShe was in another country\n\nNot knowing what was going on\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI talked to a girl today\n\nFor the first time in a while\n\nShe told me that she missed me\n\nAnd that things hadn't changed with her\n\nBut she was still behind her wall\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI opened up to a girl today\n\nWho let her emotions run over me\n\nLike tidal waves\n\nand I threw mine back.\n\nAnd they met a wall\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI saw a girl today\n\nWho ended the day with tears in her eyes.\n\nShe finally realized\n\nThat I had been talking to a wall all this time\n\nAnd not her\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI saw a wall today\n\nWith a girl leaning up against it\n\nA girl who ran to me\n\nAnd cried in my arms\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI met a lover today\n\nWho used to hide behind a wall \n\nBut now\n\nSmiles at the thought\n\nOf being with me through it all
1	This is more creative writing now than poetry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nEvery once in a while, there shines one among man.\n\nOne who actualizes his greatest good.\n\nWho becomes who they are.\n\nWho becomes a beacon of greatness\n\nWho bears under the flame and sword , turning constantly in turmoil\n\nSmiling at the pain of the sword, slicing them deeply\n\nFocusing intently on their skin that the flame hath decided become charcoal\n\nConstantly running through themselves\n\nFighting every abysmal monster within themselves\n\nAnd abysmal might just be the best word for it\n\nFor every monster within a man's being could turn eternal in it's depth\n\nEndless in it's demonic pain\n\nUnless a beacon shines through into them\n\nAnd allows themselves to be cut so deep\n\nAnd burned so badly\n\nEvery burn the beacon takes is a controlled burn\n\nWith sin and weakness fostering the fire\n\nAs the most effective tinder\n\nThey themselves become a fire, a great fire\n\nThe kind that entices the pyromaniac to stare deeply\n\nAnd they themselves become the Excalibur, who sees and slices with utter and absolute precision\n\nAnd there is something deep that speaks within them\n\nThat calls out to them. Asking them\n\nTo actualize these things\n\nTheir fire starts early, as they realize the demons they face\n\nBattle hardened, the ones who had to consistently fight monsters of their labyrinth before ascertaining any sort of power over them\n\nThe type to have the hoof of the Minotaur against their infant skull, pressing against them\n\nThe type to have the scars of a monster long past etched into their souls\n\nThe scars, as if they originated, also as deep as the endless chasms\n\nWith limitless potential within them, like an abyss\n\nFor they stare into the abyss, and it states back at them. And they see it as the real monster\n\nFor the real monster hides within 
1	Similar with this. Which is also only poetic in nature and not form.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nIt had been a while since I had seen the ocean. Since I had smelled the coagulate of salt water and freedom that came with each visit to it. Since the sweet and salty air tinged my senses. I had missed this salty shore before, and this visit was no different. The waves still crashed onto the beach, they still imbued the air with sweet scents and tranquil sounds. The seagulls still squawked and squalled from above. It was all exactly as I remembered it. Picturesque as I had left it.\n\nAll except for one thing. One piece of the puzzle was new. Another person had invaded my quaint slice of heaven. But she had an odd way about it; usually an addition to something like this would degrade the shore, would poison it's sounds with overbearing extroversion. But not her, she shone with the sea as if she had came from it, sparkling like a glint off of a waves peak. Her dark hair contrasted perfectly with the white sand and the shining midday sun. Perfectly explaining to anyone who was willing to look that she had been out here in the waves and that they had formed a perfect metamorphosis, working her straight hair into a beautifully frizzled mess. Bending slightly where the oceans waves dried from the sun. Her eyes, which matched her hair to a tee, felt like spotlights, glimmering confidence from their bold sienna irises. In fact, confidence could be used to sum up her whole appearance. She walked as if the world worked in tandem with her. l didn't know what to do exactly. "Who the hell has a person like that appear on them out of the blue?" l thought to myself; my toes digging into where the sand met the waves. "There's no way this is real, this isn't a thing that happens." the waves rushed in, curling slowly around my ankles, pulling them down as they retreated. I looked over at her again. I figured that I'd have to share my heaven with someone else. I mean, what could I do. She fit in to my paradise. Perfectly. Might as well make her a welcome addition.
1	 \n\nI took another step. And suddenly, the whole world opened up. My previous perceptions we're pushed outwards, and I saw the beauty in the trees and the sounds of the cars driving past for the first time in so long. I watched as my mind curled the world up into it's arms as something so precious. My eyes saw the palm trees swaying softly, awakened from their slumber. My soul broke it's shell as I watched my future slowly gain worth in my head. As I watched my own worlds possibilities open up. I started to see a future for myself, and I knew it to be true. I saw the places I could go, the streets of a future I had not known became crystal clear. The smiles of my future children's smiles and the joy they could have hit me as if I was there. And with every step that I took, with every breath expelled. I felt \*alive\*. And as I fell out of my trance, and looked up at the early morning sky, and watched the hues of the sunrise dance in my mind. The gradients of orange and purple grabbed my heart and held it softly. In that moment, I knew that from that point onward I would understand and always work to understand more about what my life could hold. For I had seen the future, and i had been my own Oracle. I had seen what every great man had seen in himself. And I had known.
1	Why is free verse even a thing?\n\nDon’t they know how it does sting? \n\nDon’t they know how common their feelings are?\n\nDon’t they know how they make me drown in their tar?\n\nI’d never tell them how much their poetry sucks,\n\nWhen they’re weeping for those YouTube bucks.\n\nI know I’m no better, \n\nJust waiting for my letter...\n\nDear Little Nobody,\n\nWhy the hell do you think you’re so damn important?\n\nYou want me to be your little show buddy,\n\nBeing ever so accordant,\n\nBut I won’t go along with your lies.\n\nYou’re just like the other flies, \n\nSwarming over the corpses of greatness you can’t understand,\n\nEver so grand,\n\nMocking them for their stand,\n\nTheir stand against time’s sand.\n\nYou think you’re original, strong.\n\nYou’re just criminal, wrong.\n\nSincerely, your better.\n\nBut every one of them’s the same,\n\nTheir emotions deep as the sea,\n\nTheir eyes full of tears; they can’t see.\n\nThey all get fame,\n\nThey speak without shame,\n\nNot seeing that they’re just more fish in the sea. \n\nAnd so concludes more shallow poetry, \n\nOf that which has been said before, \n\nI take my leave: my punishment waits just outside the door.
3	Saving money	The past couple months (ok year) I haven't been saving my money too well. I love to spend my money on other people. I'm way too giving when it comes to random gifts and such. Anyone else have this problem? How do you save money? 
3	I'm a student, so my budget is tough and the college environment isn't helping either, so to fix that I've decided to download a money tracker app and LITERALLY track everything I buy. After a month or two you start noticing some pretty bad habits which cost you alot, the best fix is to just stop buying what's expensive or find a cheaper alternative. Anyways man hope this helped and hope you have a great fucking year.
2	I keep track of my expenses and income for a start. You don't know how much you lose if you do not keep a record. You should be saving at least 10% of your paycheck every month to build up a fund in case of a financial emergency and the rest should cover all your expenses before you spend 1 extra cent
2	I’m actually pretty good with saving money but I don’t hesitate to help others financially. I actually hate spending money on myself. I would just recommend on buying only essentials and treat yourself every once in a while. Tracking what you spend is important as well. Also make a list of things your getting in the store so you don’t deviant and end up splurging on unnecessary items.
23	I failed.	\nSorry wall of text incoming - I need to get this off my chest. \n\nI met her 3 years ago when we started working together in the same company. Straight from the get-go I saw her to be an incredibly strong woman, and one with a great sense of humor to boot. We became fast friends and shared a lot together. \n\nDuring the friendship both of us were going through our own divorces, and we supported each other as friends. She then decided to leave the company to pursue her own dreams, and that's when I lost contact with her. For a period of a year and a half we were living our own lives, and just caught up for drinks here or there. \n\nFast forward to 4 months ago - we met up again for drinks. She told me everything that has happened to her in the past year. How she's emotionally abused by her ex-husband, how he was using her kids against her, and how she fell for a narcissist and was finally able to break it off at the beginning at 2018, unable to be the other woman anymore when she found out via social media that the narc proposed to his original girlfriend. \n\nThat night we hooked up - we both knew we had chemistry with each other. We both said that this was not anything serious. But we both started falling for each other the months following. She wanted to meet my friends, I wanted to take her on a wine journey (we both love wine). She wanted me to meet her kids, I opened up about my life to her. \n\nI thought everything was going great until just before Christmas. She called me and said that she has to focus on her kids. They are hurt because of the divorce and she needs to focus on their healing. She was also contacted again by the narcissist - his fiancee found out that he's cheating with yet another woman, and he decided to blame her. \n\nShe's hurt. She needed time and space to figure out everything. To focus on the healing for her kids, and to focus on the healing for herself, and in her words - to figure out what kind of relationship she wants. \n\nAt first I was angry - that this came up so abruptly and that I wasn't given the chance to help. Then I was proud - she's an INFJ who always puts others ahead of her, and she's finally able to take this step to put herself ahead of others - even if I have to pay the cost for it. \n\nI told her that I'm proud of her. That I'll always wish for her happiness, that I want her to conquer her world, and that I want her to be so great that she'll leave all her exes, including me, in the dust. \n\nThen...That was it. \n\nI felt that I failed. I felt that I should do something to help, but I know that will just lead to codependence. I know that she needs space, I know that she needs time. \n\nI just hate this part of ENFJ me that empathises with someone so much that I carry her burden. I want to be there for her, but I can't. I want to help her, but I can't. Because I know deep down that the best thing that I can do for her right now is to let her go. \n\nSo fellow ENFJs thank you for reading this far. How do you handle the helplessness that comes with not being able to help someone you love deeply? \n\nTL;DR - Broke up with woman I loved due to her life circumstances. Felt like I failed. How do I deal with this feeling of helplessness? 
9	You are a helper. Just know sometimes some people are not in the right time or place for your help.\n\nI don't have any substantive words for you because even though you're an internet stranger, I have a feeling you have a good compassionate head on your shoulders.  I have a feeling you can and will know what to do when the haze of confusion passes. This is not some young, green love. You are completely allowed to feel grief over the fact that you love this person but circumstantially cannot be with her right now. I think maybe rather than focusing on how you feel like you failed her, you could focus on things that positively reaffirm your own identity. I've met high Fe users who really get lost in the empathetic noise.  Whatever you enjoy doing, hobbies and talents and whatnot, do it.\n\nMy thoughts are with you. May you have a gentle 2019.
6	You helped her by respecting her wishes to be in control of her own life
6	Hey, I don’t have any words of advice, but I wanted to say thank you for this story. Read it all and thought it’s beautiful, though with no happy ending yet. I hope you and her find it.
3	I think only time can heal, as an ENFJ, anytime I was really hurt,  I just needed quite some time to "get over" it. I needed time to focus on me, and understand to the core, what was hurting me so badly. I needed time to truly forgive the person who hurt me, and care for myself. \n\nI honestly didn't think I would ever be able to move on, but I did, without even realizing. Just know that you did the best you could and that you didn't fail, au contraire, you had the courage to let the woman you love focus on herself ! You did the best you could, be proud and try to remember that.\n\nIf it's meant to be, it's gonna happen, hopefully with time, things will go an even better way than expected. \n\nPs: you should ask some advice of r/relationship too!\n
3	Think of it this way: you are helping her. It just isnt the way that you want to help, but it is how she needs. If you cant change the scenario, change the perspective:)
3	Wow, I always find it amazing when I see other ENFjs going through the same things that I have. I cannot speak for others feelings but I can from experience say that when I love I love with all of me. For the longest time, I felt like I was being used by others. I would help them through their problems and then they would abandon me. It took me years to figure out this truth, Love is a gift.   \n\n\nI have learned from loving so deeply, so many people who walked away that love is only a gift. It is mine to give away. I have discovered that if I help someone or love someone without expectation then I am honestly, and truthfully loving them unconditionally. I discovered that when I start expecting that love to be reciprocated that I have tainted the unconditional gift and have actually started manipulating. I don't want to taint. I want to love a person or persons for who they are not for how I can change them, not for how much they give me back, or to make them love me.   \n\n\nWhen I discovered this truth I was able to let go of my best friend and let her be herself, let her live out her life while vowing to her that I would always be there, run to her, if she ever needed me. This has deepened our friendship and honestly, it has released me from a great deal of pain. By letting go of expectations a.k.a. manipulation, I was able to give the gift of love and just let things be.  
2	I can relate maybe not the same situation but wanting to help someone when I can’t especially someone I love. It’s usually all I do. However, you’re still helping her. People need space to grow and heal. You are giving her that freedom and I’m sure she’s grateful for it. You should focus on yourself for the time being. Sometimes we are quick to help everyone else and sometimes forget to help ourselves. One thing I like to do is try to look at situations in a more positive outlook and learn from them. Don’t look at this as a fail. You helped and loved her the best way you can. I’m a firm believer in things happening for a reason. The only thing your relationship lack was proper timing. I’m sure once everything settles things will work itself out and she’ll be back in your life. I wish nothing but the best for you and your happiness! Stay strong. 
18	This one hit hard for some reason. Bo is a smart dude	
1	So do we think this guy is definitely ENFJ?\n\nIf so, why do you say so?\n\nI get the ExFy but could he be ENFP or even ESFP or ESFJ?\n
1	This one always makes me tear up...
9	Unable to disentangle strong emotions from thought - anyone else??	Hey all! \n\nI have always been a thinker. I hate to use the term "deep" because that sounds pretentious but I imagine like a lot of you, my mind is constantly buzzing with a TON of energy. So when I first took the test and I got marked as a F, I was upset.  Which seemed to indicate I am in fact a F lol. I just didn't identify as an F because I thought an "emotional" person wasn't a smart person. Fortunately I've realized they aren't mutually exclusive!\n\nMy issue - my thoughts are SOOOOO intertwined with emotion. When I like something (or am interested in something I really dislike), I REALLY like it, often researching obsessively, and I feel I physically overwhelmed. Some of my passions I straight up have to avoid for a while because I can't take the intensity. Same often for interacting with people, especially new people. I bring a lot of intensity, which I also feel somewhat overwhelmed by. I can't often just "be."\n\nI appreciate the insight and skills that my emotions have brought me, but I'm so tired and overwhelmed by them. I want to be able to enjoy contemplating the world around me, meeting new people, and exploring what interests me, but it becomes physically uncomfortable.\n\nAnyone else??? How do you deal?!\n\n\nAlso relevant - I am a highly anxious person (but super grounded and rational, which in any ways makes me feel worse about it lol)  and do have a bipolar ii diagnosis. I'm on mood stabilizers and anti anxiety/depressant. Definitely playing a role, but imagine ENFJs may also feel this way regardless of a diagnosed mental illness.\n\nEDIT: I haven't explored too much yet into all this, but DANG is this sub me to the max lolol
6	I find that writing and journaling helps serve as an outlet for my intensity. I'm the same way. I love passionately and deeply. And it's overwhelming and exhausting. Sometimes I just have to withdraw altogether to recharge. But then I get lonely and too much in my head, and I have to get back into the world. And away we go again!\n\nIt's not easy, and it sure isn't breezy. But it is what it is!  Cheers!
4	I have often apologized for being so intense, so "dramatic", so passionate but in truth, the world needs such people as myself and you. I searched for a lifetime to find a true friend because of such intensity. To be honest, sometimes we are hard to take.  My mother once said I was hard to love. I have researched my personality (ENFJ) extensively over the past five years. In that acquisition of knowledge, I learned its okay to be me. Like I mentioned above I searched for friends, I found two, both are opposite my sex, both love my passion, and both let me be me. They let me rant, they let me be over the top passionate about any subject. They let me be me. Yes, we have a thirst for harmony and balance. My best find in friendship has been a person who is overtly logical. He actually helps me gain balance when my emotions are running wild. Just some thoughts. 
2	I hear you! I call it passion. I am extremely passionate about things and people I love, as well as my interests. I’m kind of an all or nothing kind of gal.  Great advice already given, writing helps. An INTJ with common interests helps, too. They’re great at planning, I’m great at executing plans 😃.
2	I would also just like to respond to your first paragraph. I too was a little rebuffed at being called an F instead of a T. I thought, but I think all the time, in fact, sometimes that is all I do is remunerate in my head. But as you so perfectly pointed out, being so passionate about how we think definitely does tip the scales. I cannot think about an issue without being passionate about it unless I just don’t care at all because it does not interest me. Once I study an issue and have all the facts, then I passionately have my opinion because I have studied all the facts and therefore have made an opinion from them. It makes me opinionated, but people are allowed to disagree with me. I can still like them and disagree, but I find other personalities can’t seem to do this. I find this confusing. You?
1	I get you. I too happen to be bipolar. I find that my medication stabilizes the extremes to manageable, I write a journal almost every day. Starting out my day with a devotion helps me to focus in an inspiring help the world kind of way so that whatever is on my plate is doable. Sometimes just going through the experience is the ride. I don’t have to loathe it, just tame the beast of emotion that can carry me away. But, then, maybe I am a lower F than you. Each one has their own struggles and I cannot really judge, only share my own experience.
1	I channel it through poems and arts.\nIt hurts oh being alive really hurts.
27	How do you treat the ENFJ well?	So, I'm ISTP. Kind of clueless in the Feefee's department, but about a month ago I made me first friend in a new state (CO) and shes an 18 yold ENFJ. Has been nothing but kind and supportive and giving to me and we recently did a gift exchange and she seemed to love all her gifts, genuinely likes getting people things, total funny sweetheart. Very mature for her age despite being a very nonserious memey fun person. \n\nShe gives so much, In terms of objects, time, effort, on someone, and we haven't known each other long but she's become someone I really want to do right by. But I can't read her for shit. I worry that I might stress her out, or ask too much, or can't figure out what she needs when she needs it. She seems either chill or happy almost all the time and I can't tell when she's not or if she's just that good at it. \n\nI've spent a lot of time trying to develope my social skills and FE in hopes of understanding others better and doing right by my relationships and its really helped a lot, but I still fear I may not pick up on signals when she needs it, or may otherwise end up losing this wonderful new friend. \n\nHow do I give back to the ENFJ? What makes them feel good and shows them they are loved/appreciated from a friend? I've known this person for very little but they have been very kind and done so much for me, I just worry I am not doing enough back or may not be able to reciprocate the way I need to when the time comes. \n\nAny advice is appreciated. \n\n\-- Clueless ISTP. 
30	Make sure to tell her that you appreciate what she does. If she does something like buy a meal for you or help you with a page of homework make sure to say how much you appreciate her help. \n\nThe most satisfying thing for me is when I know I helped someone. That’s why hearing someone tell you that you helped them is so satisfying!
7	Words and time...and then more words! 😃 Gifts should be thoughtful.\n\nThe chill or happy most of the time might be real, it may not...I don’t bog others down with my shit, so I stay happy in the moment.
8	Directness is always appreciated. Tell her, "wow man I really can't figure you out, in a good way". Tepp her she's complex and deep and that you've even turnesld to reddit to figure her out. This sounds bad but we like talking about ourselves (in a non egotistical manner). We like figuring people out, and this includes ourselves. I recently learned SOOOO much about myself as I had the chance to say and ask things about myself in a safe space  now I am a changed person. So please, ask her! 
6	Love languages is a good one too. Mine are words of affirmation and physical touch. So I would appreciate a hug (or high five) and being told I’m awesome. 
2	ENFJ here with an ISTP best friend,\n\nOne of my favorite things about ISTP is your honesty. As an ENFJ we love words of affirmation but there's nothing worse than faking it. We can tell.  It's fake and it makes it hard to trust your genuine appreciation. Whenever I get a compliment or affirmation from my ISTP it means more than whatever everyone else says because he only says it when he truly means it.  \n\nIf you really want to show her you care just want her around. There's a big difference between 'come over if you want' and 'I want you to come over'. Bring her into your world show her the things you're passionate about even if you think she'll be bored shell probably just appreciate you opening up to her and letting her in. That kind of trust is difficult to get with an ISTP and it's wonderful. \n\nFinally just talk to her, be honest. My best friend has a hard time telling me to leave him alone because he knows I mean well. ISTPs need their alone time and sometimes we forget that. Tell her how you feel keep her updated an in the loop.\n\nISTP ENFJ friendships can be really hard but if you're both mature and truly care about each other it can be a wonderful pairing that will see the two of you become much healthier happier individuals! \n\nHope this helps! \n\n&#x200B;
2	I'm an ENFJ female and personally I enjoy words of endearment and appreciation, a well planned hangout, and mild surprises. 
1	I doubt she'll ever be tired of you asking her what she's feeling or thinking--especially when she's so giving to you. And if you do, she may actually be surprisingly honest.\n\nThe less you open up, the more worried she'll be. ENFJs really need your loyalty/friendship to them reaffirmed over and over and over again. If not, they would feel distant...
9	Falling Out of Love?	Been seeing an ISTP guy for a year now. We both fell fast but he was very on the fence about everything. Eventually, I got accused of being obsessive, bugging him too much, I was apparently too nice all the time and apparently emotionally manipulative. Like, wow, OK! I guess hanging out with me will let me brainwash you into thinking you're a good person and you're worthy of love - my bad; I just won't say anything then. I've cooled off a lot a bit, but ironically, he's gotten closer and more affectionate the more distant I've become the past few months...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI haven't cooled off to play games or act like him, it's just that I don't think I'm really safe being warm and being my authentic self any longer, something in my brain just turned off (I can't even control it). I don't think I'm really in love with him anymore and I'm scared of that. We had a future planned together, I thought this was it. I feel like he could just bail on me at this point and I'd be like "sure, fine, whatever" whereas normally I'd be flailing! I feel gross even admitting all of this because I'm still nice, I just don't mean it as much now. Maybe I'm better off alone?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: We patched it up, thanks for the advice you all.
9	Woahaha I've spoken to an ISTP guy before and there was this sort of primal attraction due to our differences. I'm not even talking about romantic attraction but a mental one. He's so rooted in the present and was able to get straight to the point when I paint grandiose word pictures, which was very interesting!\n\nLet's face it, most IxTP types will find our language too flowery and will point it out straight away because they themselves would not practice such behaviour. And also, being unable to see what purpose you may have for saying such things, they can become suspicious. They are also very grounded in a way that allows them to point out what we're doing whenever we start falling into this 'praising' ritual. \n\nThey can't help pointing it out, and we can't help praising them. : ) Maybe with time such differences can be understood.\n\nAnd I knoooow we're not doing it on purpose. We do it because we feel the need to say these things because of xyz and we often say it before we know it. I do not believe we are intentionally manipulative, but instead, we see that they are indeed a good person and such a misunderstood one that we feel the need to stand on their side to tell them they're not alone. \n\nWe see the good in them that others don't because of what I want to call the 'empathy function'. I don't believe it makes us any more of a better person, it's just a function that makes us able to 're-live' other people's experiences in a split second and know exactly why they did what they did and they are not the bad guy other people make them out to be.\n\nI've also noticed that I'm very attuned to power differences in situations, without actually being aware that I am so in the moment. I end up (can't stop myself from) thinking up different kinds of tactics to invade from all corners--and never really realise I'm doing all this until after I've done it. \n\nIts odd that I feel the most understood with an ISTP in the room. They somehow really get me. Other people just fall for my flowery language when I don't intend for them to. \n\nIf you're feeling too tired for all this it would be a good idea to take a break from it. \n\nBut it also sounds like he prefers to do the chasing so why not just kick back and see if he can win you over? ;) 
3	Enfj (f) with istp partner (m) for 9 years.   Feel ya!  Struggle is real here.  I get most of my “woo woo” (ie big intuitive ideas and conversations/feelings talk etc) from other sources than my partner.  Makes me less needy and keeps him from telling me I’m over analyzing :)
1	Ehmm... reading your post I feel you are filled with resentment. Not good. Won't lead to a good place.
1	Oh my, don't feel guilty! XD pfff he enjoys it?!
1	Awwww (>u <)\nbest of luck!!\n\nI'm sure you would gain a deeper understanding on the ISTP forum muhaha\n\n
12	If an afterlife exists, do you think you would be a different type?	If you don't think an afterlife exists, then it might not be a good idea to respond.\n\nIf you believe in an afterlife, go for it.
7	My vote is that we get better at the cognitive functions we are lacking in (become more centered), so that we retain our unique flair, but have more flexibility. 👍
3	I think we become our subconscious selves. The part of us that we unintentionally ignored or resisted throughout our first lives. For us ENFJs we’d be ISTPs *Gasp*.
2	Nah I think I’m enough awesome as is. Unless I can be even more awesome and have better memory. 
2	There's probably no cognitive functions since we wouldn't have human bodies, duh. 
3	I think you'd be the same type unless you were just insane in life. In the afterlife I think peoples "fractured" minds will be restored so I'd say those people would change to another type.\n\nIf you were sane in life I think your Type would be the same because your psych would be the same as it was in life.
2	I believe in a combination of reincarnation and eternal afterlife. You reincarnate until you have discovered the true meaning of life , which should be positive, and if you have discovered this then you can pass on to heaven or an equal version of the eternal paradise. If you fail to learn then you will be punished in your next reincarnation
1	i'm guessing that enfj's are pretty unlikely to want to change... would some other personalities make the switch? i think so, but i'm not educated on these things
1	I feel like I would be more stable. Which sounds odd as only now is guaranteed. 
1	Everyone will be the fully developed MBTI version of themselves. If heaven is the ideal place then I feel like that’s the idea scenario!
98	Sending all you amazing people all the love in the world that you rightfully deserve as we head into the new year <3 <3 <3	
5	Back at you lover
4	Wonderful sentiment. Thank you for sharing!
2	❤️❤️
2	I felt this in my soul 
26	How do ENFJs be alone and not rely on others for their happiness?	I feel like my life purpose is to help and communicate with others. I find it deeply satisfying to communicate with others and feel slightly addicted to the emotional high I get when I make/strengthen good connections. \n\nIt feels like through other people is the only way I feel truly fulfilled.\n\nHow do other ENFJs feel fulfilled without the risk of relying on others for my happiness? 
19	When you realize that you are both a treasure and treasured you can relax but to have that comfort of being alone takes a lot of development.  Loneliness will eat your soul away if you aren't in a place where you know that not only are you valued but you are valuable. We ENFJs will self-destruct if we don't come to that knowledge. The hard part is allowing someone to love you as you are but even harder is believing them. Once you find that solid rock friendship you have to almost daily remind yourself their lack of communication is not a reflection of you but a symptom of their life choices. They really do love and you have to keep reminding yourself of that. 
6	I don’t 
6	Travel! I recently studied abroad in Florence, Italy for 4 months and I had the opportunity to really put myself first and do things that I wanted to do without having to consider others as much. You can especially do this by taking some solo trips- I would do this when no one else was available, or wanted to go on the same trips as me. Though, I do admit, it can still be sad to travel alone, as we tend to find meaning in activities when sharing them with others BUT that doesn't mean that you CAN'T find meaning in activities that aren't shared with others! In fact, the great thing about solo travel is that you always get to put yourself and do what you want because you don't have to worry about pleasing the needs of someone else, and there are also lots of opportunities to please our extroverted side- you can get to know people at your hostel if you choose to stay at one (which I would totally recommend!), chat up people during a walking tour, or make conversation with people while out at a restaurant or car! Best of luck to you in your pursuit of happiness! :-)
5	You have to expose yourself to loneliness. Force yourself into situations where you have to make yourself happy without relying on others. Only then will you realize what it is you really want. 
3	Why not? You see, it's actually a powerful and beautiful thing about us. We make a good communicator and we genuinely like people. Not everyone is capable or willing to develop such passion at young age. We make a good coach, therapist, councellor, teacher etc etc the list goes on. Just keep making people happy, help them improve and as long as you aren't overdoing it, there shouldn't be anything wrong. Stay healthy and help people :)
2	Still trying to figure this out
11	Shane Dawson is ENFJ?	Do you guys think Shane Dawson is an ENFJ?  \n\nI am ENTJ and think of him as a more caring and feeling version of myself. It also seems like he uses Fe and Ni a lot. He is very caring and considerate, and he knows very well what he wants and is organized in how he wants things done. \nLet me know if you think I’m way of, and if so, why. \n
2	I have no idea if he is or not but I would LOVE it if he was. 
2	I think he is an INFJ personally. He gets really drained when he goes out too much but still just "gets" people in a very special way.  
1	id say infj as well. he does seem extroverted too tho i dont think he likes being alone too much. \n\ni think ryland is an isfp does someone agree? :D\nhe reminds me so much of isfp's ^^ they as well wouldnt want to be alone for too much. anyways theyre both such a good match!
16	Hello my fellow ENFJs! Thought I'd share my 2018 reflection with you all because it seemed like it would resonate with a lot of our types :)	2018: A Work in Progress. But Hey, Rome was Not Built in a Day!\n\n\nWhile reflecting on all that’s happened this past year in 2018, I realized that the first half of this year, I was aiming to simply check boxes because that’s what you’re supposed to do. As the year progressed I was just waiting for the next life stage to take place. I wasn’t living for myself, and I didn’t feel like I had a sense of purpose or real goals. Grad school was this destination that was basically meant for the upcoming future. But I didn’t put those plans in place. I wasn’t being active setting myself up for that next step, because I couldn’t even visualize that component of my future. It was all just implied and expected. But I didn’t believe in it, or feel passionate for pursuing this goal. I was lost, and throughout this time I was just watching the days go by waiting for the months to get over and letting life just move along as uneventful as possible. But I hated that too. All I wanted was to feel special and important, and that my life and work had meaning. I felt like I was just checking boxes. Boxes that weren’t designed by myself but boxes dictated by society and what my immediate circle wanted from me because they figured these were the boxes best suited for my lifestyle. But it wasn’t my checklist. I didn’t even know how to design my checklist. I was unhappy because I didn’t feel any sense of pride or ownership in my life and my actions. I needed a project. I needed a goal. I was just checking boxes. I kept yearning for a challenge and stress. I missed being left to my own devices and having to devise a solution to tackle a beast head on. Tackling beastly projects gave me satisfaction and I was left in a peaceful meadow that hadn’t had a beast spotting in months. \n\n\nThen summer happened, and be careful for what you wished for is simply an understatement. I got the stress, challenges, and projects like I wanted. But people drove me insane. My team lacked motivation and I was carrying the load for 4. People didn’t care. I cared too much. I was attached towards results that didn’t even exist yet. I was putting 110% of my efforts towards a goal in the hopes that the actions would lead to results that I intended. But that’s not how life always works. Sometimes results are completely out of your control no matter how great you are and all the effort you put in. Sometimes people just won’t care, or deliver like how you hoped. I had to learn to accept that it is what it is. I had to learn to let go of outcomes that were beyond my control. I had to learn that sometimes in life, after you put all the work in, then you can only wait patiently on the other side for the result--where the final verdict is locked away in a cellar with a big KEEP OUT sign that you can no longer influence or appeal, and that’s ok. Likewise, you can be 100% passionate about the things you do and you would do all you can to get someone to be just as passionate. However, not everyone will care as much as you and that’s ok too. You don’t always have to care that much either. At the end of the day there’s more to life than just caring. It’s ok. \n\n\nI also learned that it’s important to take care of yourself first and that alone time is ok. I was so busy taking care of others and making sure everyone was ok. I got so carried away in taking care of other people that I was neglecting myself. I wanted to make people happy. So I would take the special me time to go and uplift those I cared about and I felt happy and fulfilled from helping them, which I then assumed was a form of self-care. I was helping people to fill a void in myself because I knew doing things for others gave me a sense of purpose and made me feel good and kept me going. But I also realized I was terrified of being alone which was why I sometimes went out of my way to be there for people. I wanted to feel like I was important to the other person so that they would love me and not want to leave me. I depended too much on my friends to make me feel loved and successful. But I wasn’t feeling that when I was alone with myself. I needed a life purpose to drive myself to feel good about myself. I was scared to be alone. I depended on others for happiness and feeling success. I was bullied often as a kid, and one of the taunts from the bullies was them saying to me that no one can love me and that I would end up alone--which made me fear that I would never find people that liked me. That I would not find people that would make me feel like I belonged somewhere. All of which would therefore depict me as a failure if I was alone with no one by my side. Eventually I realized that the bully lies were all wrong, because I do have good people in my life that enjoy my company and appreciate my presence in their lives. I also learned to be more comfortable with myself and not having to depend on others to feel good about myself. I started to appreciate the solo me time to recharge and not have to think about what other people thought about me. I stopped caring for what people would think if I didn’t have plans on Friday night. It didn’t make me a loser, it was just how I wanted to make myself feel happy. Right now I want to invest in myself. I want to become a smarter impactful leader. I’m doing good work career wise and learning new skills that’s going to help me over the next few months. I’m getting stronger mentally and professionally. I’m making myself feel proud of where I’m heading in life. I have a dream and a goal and I feel good about myself and where i’m headed. I finally have a sense of a purpose and a goal. I’m on my way to being the best version of me. But I’m happy being with myself and working on myself. I’m living the life I want to live and figuring out what makes me happy and what I want to do with my life. The clouds are disappearing and I can see more clearly. \n\n\nLearning to accept what comes in life was a big lesson I learned in the second half of the year. I also realized that in life, we’re meant to design and create our own checklists. And those checklists are all up to you to decide for the time lines and checkpoints. When you start following your own checklist, then you feel a lot more ownership, more motivation, more drive, more fulfillment. You start filling in your own goals. Your own sense of purpose. You feel that sense of ownership that hey guys look this is MY plan, not some template the average joe blindly follows on default. I still have no clue what the future holds for me. Hell I don’t even know if this checklist will be valid in 3 months. But for now I’m happy where I’m headed in life and what I’m doing. I like what I’m doing. I like what I’m learning and teaching myself. I like helping people. I like taking care of myself and learning more about myself.  I like being alone with myself and my thoughts. I still like being there for people, but I love it more when I can do it after being charged up to my optimal levels. I love people. I love what I do. I love getting people excited about what I do. I like making things better for myself and those around us. I’m on my way to big things in life. I’m making positive changes for myself. I’m going to make a positive impact on other people’s lives. I’m where I’m meant to be right now and I’m on my way to big things. I will continue to move forward and make the best of what I have available. I am going to be ok.
5	Your reflections definitely struck a chord with me. Your first paragraph described my 2018 so well. I don't think I got the challenges like you did and I've kind of been lost since. However I'm at a point now wondering what challenge to take on next while trying to rely on my friends less. What did you do to resist the need to emotionally spill out on your friends?
3	Really great. I strongly relate to what you've written here. Thank you sandshrew22. \n\nwill you be sharing with us your fall and winter? is that what remains of your WIP?
3	Also thanks for the Silver guild kind stranger! Glad to hear this writing resonated with quite a few of you :). \nI shared this writing in the hopes that it could inspire you and to remind you that you're not alone when figuring stuff like this out about life. ENFJs are there for each other to help us see the light in ourselves when we're too lost to see it on our own ❤. 
3	Enfj/esfp	#help I've always thought I was an ESFP for the last decade, but I recently decided to re-take the test and also look through the functions, and I feel strongly identified with enfj. Any advice on typing enfj? 
2	Study the cognitive functions. 🌈 
2	Yes, ENFJs can look like ESFPs in the same way ENTJs can look like ESTPs.  It's the tertiary Se and what your relationship and experience towards it.  Most typologists say that as we grow older we start being more comfortable with our lesser used functions.  \n\nA comfortable, unstressed Fe-Se relationship looks carefree, and is very enjoyable to indulge.  At it's worst in can be reckless and self-destructive without thought of consequences.  Ultimately, Fe and Se as dominant functions do look very different.  I would encourage you to look at the cognitive functions and not just general type descriptions because cognitive descriptions tend to be more nuanced. \n\nMany people have a hard time recognizing unstereotyped Fe.  I really like [Socionics descriptions](http://socionic.info/en/et/buklet.html) of Fe (extroverted ethics), which is much more neutral and stripped of goody-goody, sacrificial, motherly/fatherly components of the MBTI versions of Fe.  
1	Esfps initiate consistently in a social setting.\nI feel like ENFJs are more reserved in the long run.\n\n
9	does ENFJ like me?	confused. i'm typically extremely good at reading people's intentions or having some idea of how they feel about me but this guy is the only person i have absolutely no clue about. im an esfp (F) for reference if that does anything or if enfj's are naturally repelled by us IDK. just curious if its him or his personality type or me?? hmmm\n\n*FOR*\n\nwe hang out alone\n\ntouchy feely, cuddles,\n\nhappy to be physically close invited me to room and cuddled a little\n\nlots of talking\n\nkind\n\nhappy to make plans, seems enthusiastic\n\n*AGAINST*\n\nvery bad at consistency with text (however rly good when it comes to planning over text so idk)\n\nsuper late text backs sometimes (like days later)\n\ndoesnt really ask me questions abt me\n\nsometimes zones out completely\n\ndoesn't make a move on me (not an issue just confusing)\n\ni just get so confused because i have to remind myself we're just friends but then he's flirty and touchy when we're alone and im like whaaa?? is this Just-Friends activity? lots of mixed signals. like inviting me into his room and stuff\n\nany insight would be hella valued.\n\nedit: sorry u guys get tons of "'crush"" posts. ur just way too likeable lol
7	It sounds like he's interested but emotionally unavailable. That is not to say that he's a bad person or anything like that - it sounds as if he is dealing with something in his life and perhaps you have become a great distraction or companion but not someone that HE is pursuing. I would not pursue this (if I were you) as investing time and effort into emotionally unavailable people only leads to heartache. 
5	Hmmm... it seems like he’s testing the waters. He may not have made a move yet because he’s unsure if it will be reciprocated and doesn’t wanna risk rejection. \n\nNot asking any questions about you might just be proof that he’s not socially mature. \n\nWe zone out ALOT (Parent function Introverted Intuition) so don’t take that personally. Some ENFJs are just better at hiding there zone outs than others.\n\nI say just make the first move. Something that shows you have more than friendly intentions. You’ll know very quickly after that. 
3	it definitely sounds like a  good start, but your uncertainties regarding his overall investment may be justified (hard to say).\n\nit's definitely true that enfj tends towards your FOR column behaviors pretty readily and that it may not mean as much as it would for another personality..\n\ni think enfj is usually quite good at asking questions about another person.. not sure what to think about that (sorry)\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni wouldn't be discouraged yet if you really like him ... how long has this been going on?
3	This may be such a enfj thing to say but why don’t you ask. It won’t hurt to ask. He kinda sounds like he’s interested. 
1	ENFJs know they're needy, and can worry that being so could turn you away. \nIf you really want to know, just break the ice, he'll most likely be honest with you. 
8	Thoughts on INFPs?	Hey guys. I’m an enfj here. What are your thoughts on infps romantically/platonically.  >=>
10	I have an INFP fiance, they are super communicative with me and very understanding/loving.  Super patient with me and is the best match I've had in ever.  However, it's mostly because he doesn't like playing games or dealing with nonsense.
8	Hello boys, this is my first Reddit post :)  wish me luck...\nI just recently started dating an infp female. She is literally awesome. I have arthritis in most my joints Wich is a very personal pain I've felt most my life and no one else I've met can relate too.\n Except her.\n She has artheritic pain as well. She's highly empathetic on a level we can both relate on, same age as me as well.\nThe only problem we seem to have is that we are both trying to let each other in.\nThis takes allot of time I'm shure.\nI just know I have a completely personal abstract world I live in inside my head that is not Earth.\nPossibly Saturn.\nI keep this place highly guarded from the world around me and I feel like I she's the same way just not as extra as me. Wich I'm totally ok with.\nMy approach is to let the relationship breathe and put my manipulative hands in my pockets and let my heart do the talking. Basically... Be transparent.\nShe's responded well to this treatment and admires my honesty. I really like her. Allot. \nI dated an immature INFP for like a day and wanted to practallay commit an autopsy on myself once it ended.\n(Not my fault, her mom was like product of Nancy palosi fucking the anti crhist after they both hooked up at a club after consuming copious amounts of genetically enhanced mushrooms.) \n\nShe's tough creative and wonderfull artist. \nMy girlfriend lol.\nnot the, antichrist...\nJust to clarify....\n
12	I dated an immature one. Uncommunicative, avoidant, selfish. They say we are the ideal match but to be honest when someone makes and idealised image of you at the start of the relationship and then starts deducting points for not meeting that expectation it is particularly devastating for an enfj who already puts so much pressure on themselves to be the ideal. I’m still hurt. \n\nAlso, if an infp begins to value how they feel above the feelings of others it makes me detest them to be honest.\n\nSorry mature and healthy infps, I’m sure you exist.
3	i was a lot like an INFP when I was depressed; then I overcame depression and was back to my ENFJ self... not sure if that's interesting, or relevant, to anyone but me.\n\ni suppose i'm saying that i definitely feel like i can relate to them and generally like them/want to help them
4	I’m dating an INFP now, it has been very interesting. The relationship itself is good but not without its ups and downs. I feel that there are times he can be childish in ways but it also made me realize how childish I am too.\n\nAt first I felt like he held me on a pedestal and we had several talks about that. Now he sees my flaws and loves me warts and all. Honestly he is the most patient person I have ever been with. He isn’t very contentious and honestly that is probably my only frustration with him at this point.\n\nI’m trying to be more understanding as where my flaws are he has strengths and vice versa. It’s about building each other up. As we are mirror opposites when it comes to our functions, I’ve noticed he and I usually get to the same end result on decisions but the process of getting there is different. And to me the process doesn’t matter if in the end we agree. 
2	Thanks dude
2	Thanks dude I admire your admiration.\n
2	They're really hard to open up :cri:
1	hmm...I remember becoming very introverted (avoiding the people that I didn't want to talk to) and lacked the sort of impatient drive and direction a judger would have. \n\nxNFx 
19	Telling yourself you are a good person	How did you guys slowly start giving yourself love instead on depending on others to love you for you to feel like a good person?I wasn't even aware that this was the reason I was helping others so much. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs it to be proud of yourself? To remind yourself of the good you've done without needing people to tell how amazing you are? I find it so hard to listen to myself.\n\nThis movie scene made me cry so much, because that's how I feel man --> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtkST5-ZFHw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtkST5-ZFHw)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel so insecure about my self worth. I always feel like crap, I'm never proud of myself and I'd be so happy if I was just a little proud of myself. When I think about the way I treat myself, I want to cry. I'm doing everything, I accomplished every single dream I ever had and I'm still not even telling myself I did good.
9	Ask yourself what you want in this life and then figure out how you're gonna get it.\n\nNo one is ever truly content. Imo "fulfilment", as it were, comes from the journey to your goals, not the goals themselves. You are the only person that can do this for you. So, what do you want?
4	If you wait for people to tell you how amazing you are, it's never going to work because not everyone wants to see you succeed or even happy. Unfortunately, if you don't love yourself first, no one will do it for you. I think loving yourself starts by being grateful about everything you have and don't have. Every night a friend of mine writes down what she's greatful for. Just by doing that I've seen so much improvement in her attitude and approach to life. So, be greatful and try to rememebr what you're grateful for frequently is my first advice.\nSecondly, focus on all the good you do as well, as an enfj I'm sure that you try to do a lot of good around you. Just saying "hello" with a smile, or taking the time to open the door for someone counts. I don't know about you, but to me doing something good, necessarily had to be something big, because I was taking all the little things I would do for granted, but they count as well. It's good to focus on what we need to do to improve ourselves, but only doing that can bring us to a black hole with no exit. So second advice, acknowledge the good you do around you even if its just a simple action. (Don't be a brag lol, just know that you're able to do good).\nMy last advice would be to forgive yourself. It's okay, we're humans, we mess things up sometimes. Try to remember to forgive yourself my friend, it's helped me a lot. Don't let anyone tell you that you can't.\n\nSorry that was a little longer than expected! You're awesome, don't forget that !
3	How did I know exactly what clip you linked before even clicking on it? Enfj people know each other well I guess hahaha
6	I Need Help	I'm sorry if this is cringe but- \n\nENFJs-  I need a sample of data from previous relationships, which types have you had your best relationships with and with which types have you had your worst relationships with?\n\nPlease, I am deeply in love with an ENFJ at the moment and want to estimate the probability of success and so I need this information\n
7	Current and healthiest partner: INFP\n\nPartners I loved the hardest: INFP, INFP, ENFP\n\nPartners I had the best sex life with: INTJ, INFJ\n\nPartner I felt the most known by and connected with: ENFJ\n \n\n\nINFPs: I can do anything with them and enjoy myself and feel deeply mystified by their presence. Often aloof or feel that they could leave at any given time. \n\nINTPs: deeply intriguing and yet they often find me overwhelming or don’t understand my emotions and can’t relate to me. \n\nENFPs: always a step out of my reach, something I want but can’t have, but so much fun and a whirlwind of romancing. Often leave without warning.\n\nINTJs: enjoy the idea of me but have trouble being there for the experience of me. Often get upset with me for needing emotional connection in inopportune times. \n\nINFJ: at their unhealthiest resemble INTJs, often think I have a hidden agenda at their unhealthiest. \n
5	Hi there, friend. \n\nIf you want my opinion here it is:\n\nThe relationships I've shared with ISTPs are not one of the best. We misunderstand and offend each other very easily; And as an ENFJ, I try my best to understand everybody and to not offend anyone...\n\nAll the ISTP' friendships that I had in my life simply faded with time. I didn't put much effort to reach out to them and they eventually stopped reaching out to me. \n\nWhen I, as ENFJ, try to compliment an ISTP, they demonstrate awkwardness and uncomfortableness, almost as if they don't take the compliment as sincere.\n\nOur conversations may end up having awkward pauses and abrupt endings too.\n\nThere are more examples, I just wrote these from the top of my head.\n\nOverall I really hope for your sucess in whatever relationship you want to have, but also be aware of the psychological incompatibility that you share with each type. If you have any more questions, go ahead.\n\n
3	Engaged to an infj

3	I married an INTP! I love how we are opposites in everything except sharing the N in common. We have very deep and analytical conversations and are always learning together and teaching each other new things. 
3	Married to an INFJ :)
3	Married for 14 years to an INFJ. Incredibly fulfilling relationship!
2	Married to an ISTJ 🤗
2	Best relationship so far is an INTP\n\nWorst being ENFP I had married and then ISTP.l being second. \n\nOkayest INTJ\n\nTried dating other ENFP’s and INFP’s... I just can’t. 
2	Best is probably INFP and ENFP. My worst was also an ENFP though so it varies person to person 
2	My [ENFJ F] SO of 6 years is an ESTJ [M]. Though tons of resources say were mismatched, we complement each other.\n\nWhat we agree on: We are very highly family oriented people. We are very career focused and want to be successful so that we can be our best selves while also helping others (I.e. filial piety, buy parents a house, help struggling siblings, etc). We both care a lot for our friends/loved ones (albeit he expresses this more with financial or practical support, while I’m a better emotional support). We are transparent about expectations in the relationships/with each other and are dedicated to building a stable foundation that is geared towards uplifting our loved ones.\n\nWhat we disagree on: He can sometimes be tactless with his words and I can be sensitive. The way we express our emotions is very different and takes effort to understand each other. He’s very much a stickler for black and white rules while I function on a case by case basis in a world of gray. He values efficiency, or the “right” way, over how it impacts other people, while I would rather take extra time to do something if I can figure out a method that makes everyone happier overall.\n\nI would say my least compatible match is ENFP (And as a disclaimer, my experiences are not absolute truth or a blanket statement for other ENFJs who know ENFPs). And not to make ENFPs sound like the bad guys, but I’ve personally needed to really put in more effort than compared to other types into understanding them/their values. Maybe I just happened to meet some unbalanced folks who happen to be ENFP? Either way, the reason I feel I can’t connect romantically (at least to the ones I know) is because they tend to be non committed or quit a lot of things when the going gets rough or if it’s not interesting to them anymore. They have so much potential to accomplish amazing things if they could just see through the tough times and commit fully to their projects. The ENFPs I know also possess an unawareness of how their actions/words affect others and can sometimes say things they think are funny or normal but actually hurtful to others. They also are very scatterbrained and a bit erratic for my lifestyle personally and assume a fiercely independent attitude that focuses on the self (for me, I’m all about focusing externally on other people so that’s a conflicting value) I’m all for ENFPs being the fun, adventurer types they are, but in terms of a mate, I don’t think we’re a good match. However, I have ENFP friends and although we’re not romantically involved, we always have a super fun time :) They’re great, just not my romantic match.
2	Two bad relationships with two infj's, was just too much wanting to help and fix without ever realizing that it was never going to happen. But it taught me valuable lessons so that's a positive.
1	I'm with an INTJ :)
34	How to feel fulfilled as an ENFJ without relying on helping others to fill the void?	I'm very new to reddit but I have been reading up on all of the posts about ENFJs. I am a female ENFJ and one wall I have really slammed into this year, is the realization that I have no idea how to be happy when the people in my life are miserable. I feel as if all of my energy and efforts go towards uplifting the people around me and I am utterly drowning now. After attempting to take a step back, I realized I needed to do more for myself and work on making myself happy without others. The problem was, I realized the easiest form of happiness/being filled back up comes from surrounding myself with people who are happy and positive. However, my life is completely void of these kinds of people at the moment. \n\nI am in a heavily toxic undergrad/college program, my boyfriends family is going through a very messy divorce and he is between jobs, my family consists of naturally negative/anxious people, and my closest friends this year have either disappeared with no answer or have become completely self absorbed and it drains me to try to be around them. I have finally hit a wall trying to fix these situations and need to take a step back and find inner peace apart from these people and their situations.\n\nAll that to say, how can ENFJs find happiness without relying on others to fill them up? I do work very hard in school, at my job and trying to spend time on things that make me happy. But nothing quite restores me like being around happy, healthy people who just love or appreciate me for me. Any advice or ideas is greatly appreciated.
12	Fellow ENFJ here - I can definitely appreciate where you're coming from.\n\nI think us ENFJs are attracted to a connection at a deepest level, and for us to be invested in the growth of those people. For me, this comes out in my personal life as I continue to be attracted to girls who have 'potential' to be better, and losing sight of the person in front of me. That longing for a deep connection and seeing other people grow, thrive, and bring themselves out to be the best version of themselves sometimes trigger what I like to call a "Savior complex". This is usually rooted in the belief that one needs to save someone before one can be loved. \n\nI'm not sure if this applies to you or not, but if this rings at all true,   what I found helped was to take a step back from all of these draining relationships, and realise that I matter too. There are times when we have to allow ourselves to put us first in front of these other sources of drain and either take time off, change the situation, or remove yourself from the situation altogether as a whole. \n\nI think you stepping back to find inner peace is a great first step - hopefully that'll lead to something better and bigger. Remember that you matter and that you are important too. 
4	I agree.\nAlthough I am an ENFJ it does massively annoy me that a lot of personality forums virtually only encourage us to find harmony through others. I’m almost bitter about this, I suspect that it comes from other types writing how we outwardly seem to flourish, without insight to how draining it can be giving yourself until you have very little left (I sound like I’m wildly emotional here, I swear I’m not!)\n\nHowever, yeah, helping others makes me feel good and balanced. But how do I focus and find myself *before* bringing other people into my midst?\n\nEDIT: Cue somebody suggesting that I’m an INFJ because ENFJs can never be mildly introspective
1	I can relate to this so much. It seems that all of my energy comes from trying to help people, cherishing them, and imagining ways to improve their lives.\n\nFind people that you can talk to and vent a little. \nDo a kind deed to someone. \nAsk for help, because you obviously need it.\nAnd don't isolate yourself!\n\nStay strong and don't give up.
1	I used to sink my all into others. I still do to a degree, but I have learned to be self reliant to discover and propagate my own happiness. First, I sought out things to do that make me happy - I got back into running. It forces me to think and work hard. I enjoy the endorphins and it helps me be healthy. Second, I worn on projects around the house that teach me new skills and I find gratification from - it can be printing and placing photographs in frames or building shelving for the laundry room. \n\nYou can do it!  You find your joy and seek it out!
1	God I didn’t even put two and two together that this is an ENFJ thing.  I live in a poor country in Asia and I am rich (By comparison) and American and I feel so much guilt walking around every day.  I give back as much as I can but it just feels so unfair that some people have such hard lives when mine has been so easy.  
3	It was the weirdest thing that happened to me. Right after this heartbreak...	It was the weirdest thing that happened to me. Right after this heartbreak, I felt completely "feminine". As an ENFJ, I always loved girls too fast. I liked a lot of different girls and I was shy to go talk to them because I would seem to feminine.\n\nThis one time I lost my girlfriend, she even treated me as a friend when I saw her again. I felt horribly misunterstood. I asked us to have a week to focus on different things and when I saw her again, she acted like we were just always friends.\n\nAfter I met another girl, who I really liked but realized that she thought we were just a summer thing. I was fucking sick of it, believing in people too much fucked me up, so I went full logic and rationale, no emotions. I've been so unhappy, it's crazy. I've achieved everything I wanted, become a multi millionaire at age 22, get to 9% bodyfat, I had sex with around 100 girls in 3 years, but nothing of that shit mattered man. I'm so sad and I'm tired of being ashamed of believing in others. Yet, I feel like I've been betrayed over and over again and I don't believe in people anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome guys tried to make me sign a contract for a business that was essentially very bad for me (they had bad intentions, they were using me), I helped my friends to start their business, meet girls, but they didn't bother lifting a finger to help me out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm reaching out because I'm fucking tired. I was lucky to find an INFP who loves me and loves to stay next to me when I cry out of desperation, she's adorable. I've been with her for 1 year and a half now. She's the only reason I'm still functioning. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy question is how do you not feel like crap when people you help don't give a shit about you. How do you not want to become a douchebag or smthg? I feel like the story of my life is feeling used.
8	Don't expect a reward from helping others. Realize that giving people the help they need is its own reward. But that doesn't mean you need to help everyone, because you can't. Sometimes you gotta find your wown way to make yourself happy. That's your responsibility and no one elses. If you don't know how to make yourself happy, which it sounds like you don't, then take a step back, take some time off, and find out.
3	yea, you expect too much from others and these expectations lead to disappointment. You need to take things with a grain of salt.  Be nice, to be nice, not to get a cookie.  Like expecting shit in return from people puts you in relying on external validation too much.  That's unhealthy and it's also unhealthy to rely your sole happiness on your partner.  To be honest, if you don't change that kinda thinking, you'll eventually put a lot of burdens on your partner which is extremely unfair.  Honestly, if you don't change how you view things, you'll eventually wear down those closest to you and will remain feeling the way you do.
2	I’ve always been very trusting of people and I try to look at the positives in everyone. However, (as an ENFJ) it’s bit me in the butt a couple times. The best advice I can give is to either help people without expecting anything in return, or help out only close friends who you know have your back. I’ve fallen into the second category and since then, my life has been much better
2	I’ve been disappointed that those I Have continuously helped have not stepped up to help me. But it was pointed out to me by my INTJ that all the others are not like me, that they just don’t know how to help others like I do and they need to be asked. He was right, I never ask for help! 
5	Enfj's: what's your favourite super hero?	I'm an previous enfp turned enfj and I've always wondered what questions would merit typical but interesting responses from each type. I think super heroes are what our aspirations fulfill themselves into if imagination could become reality. \n\nI also think it'd be cool to ask what would be your super power if you could have/make one?\n\nOne last question that I don't think anyone is ever asked but it seems strange not to have one; what's your favourite letter? I mean, everyone has a favourite number and there's infinite of those, favourite colour and there's thousands of those. But there's only 26 English letters and I don't think anyone has ever really thought about what theirs is, or even why that is their favourite. P.s. most people pick the first letter of their name right away without thinking so put a bit of time into it and make it unique, like all of you awesome people are :)\n\nBtw, fav super for me is the blue lantern, specifically Saint Walker. \n\nSuper power I would have is a kind of hive mind multiplication power, kind of like cloning but experiencing every one of your selves experiences, but every clone cares not that or if they are the original and our bodies update by the nanosecond to the most positively Physical and mental version of ourselves so that if one of us worked out that we would all acquire the muscle gain without all the muscle tearing pain/negatives. Also one reads one book and then all have read that book, it's like sending a brainiac army into a library and the same into a gym. Btw you'd be able to hold back the updating for as long as you wanted or until you went to sleep, so you could finish a workout, rest and then update to remove the tiredness but not the muscle gain or something alone those lines.\n\nFav letter is L, cause you can't spell love without L. I know it's corny but my last letter was T for time because all I thought was how I needed more time in my life but then I realized that all I really need is love, then the little time we have becomes that much more precious and appreciated.\n\nThanks peeps and hope to hear what cool questions you can think of that you'd like to get a mini poll started to kind of open up the idea of what kind of pictures we paint with the answers :)
5	I think super heroes are stupid, and a complete waste of time and intelligence. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nthat being said. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBatman. 
3	Spider-Man and then Green Lantern (Hal) very closely after
3	If I could have any super power it would be the ability to properly read people's true motives and intentions so that I would stop wasting my energy on people who dont want it or people who are actually just going to use me as a permanent crutch.\n\nOr just the ability to fly. Either is cool.
3	Spider-Man definitely. He makes me feel like anyone can be a good person. You can just be a regular guy and at the same time have the kindest heart. Also, Hulk is a close second. I wish I could let out anger like that sometimes. 
3	I always adored spiderman and hulk.  Super hero's that are super misunderstood, but they take to the positive as best they can. It's not easy to do the right thing, but at the end of the day, they struggle to do what's right.
2	Doctor Strange, because of the idea that even when your life seems over, there may be greater, even if more difficult, things in your future. \n\nH... because it looks nice (?)
2	My favorite super hero has always been Black Panther. \n\nHe's the kind of man that I aspire to be - strong when required, gentle when needed, indomitable sense of guardianship (protecting those he loves), and having a sense of pride that comes from knowing exactly who he is. In fact, I'm not surprised if he's an ENFJ himself.  \n\nOne of the biggest points of contention in his arc is the quote that's been repeated in the MCU: \n\n> You are a good man. With a good heart. And it is hard for a good man to be a king.\n\nThis is a perfect illustration for me about the battle between my values, and what my mission in this world requires me to be. Somehow T'Challa has the power to balance this two - unwavering in his sense of self without compromising who he is for the sake of the mission. 
2	Flash or a firebender. Somehow I always wanted to be fast.
2	Oh definitely Spider-Man. I feel like he just perfectly embodies the selfless ENFJ. \n\nIn many situations, Peter Parker is always dealing with the issue of progressing in his own life, or risk it in order to save someone who is truly in need. To drop your own thing to help someone else’s thing, even when you need help yourself.... that’s a real ENFJ quality that I can relate to. \n\nMy favorite power to have would be teleportation: cliche maybe, but if someone needs my help I’m not just a phone call away now... or a 30 minute drive down the road. I’ll come to you! NOW. 
1	I like Batman best, because he’s not actually a superhero with superpowers , he’s just a rich man with lots of gadgets 😃
1	I was surprised to see others love Hulk too. Something about Banners’ quiet, wise, intelligent caring that turns into a rage that is both protective and out of control and makes him ashamed really resonates. \nAnd yes to spider man too for his every-day-person vibe and how he constantly makes mistakes and gets back up because it’s not about him. \nI also loved Superman in man of steel because of his humility (choosing not to retaliate against bullies) and selfless courage (which is obviously a super hero thing overall).\nAnd Black Panther yep.\n\nLetter... maybe K. 
26	Any tips for living more in the moment (Se)?	As an ENFJ I feel like it’s hard to “turn off” my Ni. As a result, I’m constantly thinking of the future. From small things like planning the rest of my week and how to respond in a hypothetical, to huge things like who my partner will ultimate be. When I party or do adrenaline pumping sports I feel very in the moment. Any tips on how to live more in the moment during the normal day to day? 
14	Hmm so is this an ENFJ thing? I too find myself dreaming of future while not focusing on the present. I enjoy the dreaming but it would nice to balance it with some more focus on the present
13	This is also a sign of anxiety. I suggest practicing mindfulness, it is really helpful! :)
6	I find listening to music, specially movie soundtracks, to be grounding. Also, writing, be it in diary or fiction form. Putting things into paper helps clearing one's mind.
5	So often we talk about “mindfulness” - it’s kind of a buzzword. But how do you do it? I can’t sit in a room and meditate. What I have found helpful practice I’ve outlined below: \n\nPractice your habits of focus, attention and observation. To do that, start a nature journal and go outside and look - really look at something you find close up right in your own yard, for example, a leaf. Train yourself to observe its qualities, it’s structure - with all 5 of your senses (unless it’s poisonous and then use your brain). Allow yourself to wonder why it is the way it is. Attempt to draw it in your journal. Write out your descriptions and questions about it. Don’t get out your phone and try to find the answers. Just ask the questions and let them sit with you while you’re out there. You can find the answers later. Maintain your focus on the here and now in that moment. Start with 5 minutes in your backyard. It’s amazing how much more you can observe when you’ve worked on these focus, attention, and observation “muscles”. \n\nAnother similar exercise is to go and look at a view. Really look at it. We so often see a pretty park and think “how nice”And then move on without reflecting what makes it nice (or not). Then turn around and describe it or sketch it in your journal from memory. We spend so much time staring at screens 3 inches from our faces - but we have amazing eyes and they need to focus on things both near and far, large and small. \n\nHope this helps you as it has helped me! 
4	Tip 1: Take care of a pet. It has taught me everything I know about patience, zero tolerance, kindness, repetativeness, and communication. Teach a dog a trick. Have a bunny trust you (prey animal, doesn't like to be picked up, skittish). Let a shop cat approach you. Living in the moment can be exactly one second or a 10 min pet training session.\nThis also helped me think of my day in sessions or sections, with each session with a mini goal: the hour before a long meeting is meeting prep and clearing inboxes. Meeting itself is a session. After meeting is a session for follow-up. Project tasks are each a session.\n\nTip 2: I also practice yoga, which helps when someone else is in charge of the activity. When I don't have to think about the environment, timing, or what's next, I can allow myself to just exist in the moment and follow the one instruction at a time. Not thinking ahead, not worrying my headstand didn't last as long, it's ok. That mindset of "I have spent time planning so I can do this one thing in front of me now" is the living in the moment.\n\nEdit: spelling
3	Same here and I wish I knew how to do the same
3	Well if you only worry about the future without acting in the now, then you will never reach the future you desire
1	Very helpful! Thank you. 
3	I wonder... is ADHD high in the ENFJ population?	I’m aware that the huge majority of the general population do not understand what ADHD is, it manifests very differently in people with it. \n\nI just want to see if anyone else has ADHD here...\n\nENFJ 21M, ADHD-PI. 
1	Enfj-26, m add (basically the same) and what is pi sorry?
1	I got it
1	predominantly inattentive 
1	I’m an ENFJ with ADHD...
1	As an ENFJ (M), I've fallen hard for an INTP (F)	Okay, so, to preface, I'm a genuinely happy guy in a good place. I'm in university and I'm studying history, I'm satisfied with my life thus far, have an excellent family, and am overall just quite thankful for my situation in life.\n\nThat being said, I had found myself on the r/MakeNewFriendsHere subreddit (I don't even know how I found out about it, honestly) and started to message a few people and eventually made a post of my own. Most the people I met there, we either didn't click or didn't talk long enough to find out, except for this one gal (the INTP). I had messaged her after seeing her post and we got to talking and exchanged WhatsApp fairly quickly after it seemed we shared quite a few interests. Now, I'm usually one for in-person interaction over that of online (as I'm sure all of you are as well), but she seemed to be quite a good gal and we continued talking anyways.\n\nWe talked pretty sporadically and stopped talking for a few weeks (life gets busy), but once we got back to talking, it was even better! Now, at this point, neither of us knew what each other looked like, so at my prompt (or hers, I don't remember), we exchanged pictures. What followed was something I was honestly not expecting - she was (and is) the most beautiful girl I've ever seen! I am not exaggerating in the slightest, this girl is a 10/10 not only with her physical beauty, but her soul! I'm not a bad looking guy either, but compared to her, I can't even compete!\n\nTalking further, we came to realize we shared in most all our fundamental values (actually, I think all of them) and we get along just swimmingly in conversation! It also turns out she's an INTP, so there's that too! She's said before things like, "I don't deserve you," "why are you the cutest person in the world ever" and some more I'm forgetting. Our chemistry is off the walls and I've always liked her as a person from the start, but over the past few days (or weeks, honestly don't remember) my feelings have snowballed and I really, really like her and I think I could see a future with her. She is such a fantastic, funny, cute, genuine, amazing person, that being with her is like a high! Now, for me, I can't be attracted to someone unless I really know them as a person and their values and such, and for this girl, that's happened.\n\nThis is the problem: she's halfway across the world. With the advent of 21st communication, I can still talk with her (even if we are 7 hours apart), but I've decided I want to approach her about a relationship. The thing is though, I'm not sure how to go about doing it. If I knew her in person, I'd just ask her on a date or something of a similar fashion, but considering we've never met and only know each other through text, phone calls, and video chat, I'm not sure what all I can do to initiate that in what has thus far simply been an online friendship.\n\nI'd really appreciate some help / advice from fellow ENFJs or INTPs on going forward! :)
4	send her this post!
1	So, I Messed Up...	I posted here a while back--maybe a month ago--about being attracted to my boss, whom I'm pretty sure is an ENFJ, and wondering if she might be interested in me. Well, I no longer work for her. In fact, I no longer work for that company at all, and I left on really, *really* bad terms. I have another job already, so that part is settled. \n\nI can't give too many details about what happened when I left because I know she uses Reddit. Long story short on my departure, though, is I put up with a lot of nonsense at this company, and I basically ended up letting some key people have a piece of my mind--including her, because she, unfortunately, was part of the problem(s) (although I generally think she tried not to be, but she just was). I think she is an awesome, amazing person and one of those people whom everyone likes...and I think *hanging out* with her would be fun/great and we even talked about hanging out once...but *working* for her was not working for me (and not for reasons related to the attraction--in fact, I might not have held a lot of stuff in as long as I did if it weren't for liking her so much). \n\nBasically, I didn't handle leaving the right way because I was really angry at the time, and not just with her. I think she's mad at me. She didn't say anything to me when I left and didn't even come out of her office. I sent her an email apologizing for some things (but not everything because I actually meant everything I said before I left) and tried to make it clear that it was not personal at all, and she didn't respond. I don't even know if she read it. I know I made her look bad because she hired me, and I know I've made her job harder.\n\nWhen I left, I thought, "Oh, good--*that's* done," talking about my interest in her because that's how I felt. Yeah, ***no***. I see [the one post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/enfj/comments/9z06g9/theres_a_few_things_every_enfj_needs_to_hear/) about ENFJs being so impactful and people being drawn to them. It's been several years since anyone has drawn me in or made an impact on me, and never quite like this. Being an IXTJ, I am no good at dealing with stuff like this (and by "this", I mean everything I've described here), and usually when I try to fix screw-ups--especially in social relationships--I make them worse. \n\nAny insight into how she might be thinking/feeling or if there's anything I can do? I have her number and we used to text sometimes, but I feel like I better just let things go and try to move on. I really do feel bad about everything and feel I ruined how well we were getting along otherwise. And I really hate that we met under these circumstances, too, and not at some party I was forced to attend or something.
11	Delete her number. Do not contact her under any circumstance. Move on. 
10	Job options for ENFJ's?	I absolutely hate working in an office. I recently quit my job because my soul and mental health was literally going downhill each day I spent there..... I am curious if anyone else feels this way? I recently discovered that maybe I should base my career off my personality rather than my interests.... sooo calling all ENFJS, what jobs are you in and do you enjoy them?
9	First of all, good for you for ditching the situation that was bad for your health.\n\nSecondly I just want to say offices aren't all that bad. I'm interning as a developer in a big corporate office space, but it's really lively and HR always finds ways to keep things interesting. Plus the amount of interaction I have with various people about the project I'm on makes it a great working environment for me.\n\nYou just gotta find a place that'll appreciate you for your strengths and make you feel like you're not wasting your time. Good luck out there!
9	High school teacher - a job which I often hear is suited for ENFJ types. It’s never soul sucking but often high stress. Sometimes the work follows you home in both negative and positive ways. I think the stress aspect can be quite different from country to country though. I could also easily teach overseas if I wanted, so if you’re high energy then that’s a great opportunity. And I feel like everything I learn/personally enjoy can translate into teaching. For example I’ve been learning German as a personal pursuit but this could become a teaching area for me in the future.
6	Nurse ! Love it :D 
5	My GF has been working events and merchandising for a while and finds it tolerable. It's not her career path, but able to get through it while she works out the better options.
4	I was studying medicine for a couple years and thought it was perfectly suited for me because I like helping people. However it was exhausting and very stress-inducing so I made a tough decision to leave and focus on my personality strengths more.\n\nNow I’m studying business with a concentration in marketing and I’ve utilized my public speaking, charisma, and communication skills a lot more which has made me happy. It has a lot of great jobs and long term, id like to work in either HR, healthcare administration, or advertising 
3	Counseling ^,^
3	Working trade shows and stuff.  You can get paid a lot manning booths and interacting with people telling them about products or food things.
3	Investment Banker. Currently working in a very junior position and don’t think it fits my personality super well. That said, I think that at the more senior levels, it becomes more of the right fit 
2	Healthcare, teaching, politics, organizational leadership 
2	I am an ENFJ studying interior design and I LOVE it. The majority of my career is considering the needs of others and finding creative solutions to make things easier/flow better for people. I think it's a great job because we are inherently good at considering others needs and this field demands that. It also allows for a lot of creativity mixed with making peoples lives better. Just my two cents. Good luck finding a new career!
2	I got an MBA at a more liberal top 10 program, and 2/3rds of my cohort were ENFJs. Most went into tech. Product management and organizational behavior seemed to be the major trend. 
1	I'm a engineer, although I'm trying to move towards a more strategic role instead of one in nitty gritty design. I had a role that was supporting real time operations and that was suuuuuper stressful. I realized my favorite part about the job was when I could study something until I felt comfortable with the material enough to communicate to others. That's my favorite part of the job. 
1	Being an advocate for people - social, workplace, etc. Maybe a representative of some type I.e councillor/local politician 
1	I work in tech as a Scrum Master/Teams Coach, and I absolutely love it. Before this, I was an online Community Manager. I would say that both are really suited towards ENFJs. \^\^
8	Quick question/discussion: do the holidays get you excited or stress you out	Wondered how everyone else felt about seeing family/friends and all forced interactions that come with this time of year
4	Depends on age, for me as an adult I’m not forced to have any interaction. I choose. I spend time with those I love and care about, close friends and parents. And I love to give!
3	Dislike seeing family that I don't see often because it's kind of awkward, otherwise I love the gorgeous Christmas aesthetic 😍💖🎄
3	Stresses me out, but its because I'm not studying, so I'm not doing as much constructive things as I'm used to. 
2	It’s bittersweet for me. I love, love, LOVE the preparation, the anticipation. We host our families and I try incredibly hard to ensure the setting is ‘perfect’—fun Christmas ambiance, yummy holiday treats, a delicious meal, and take home gifts for everyone that comes. I really like to be as generous as I can and make sure everyone leaves with great memories. But with all of that said, it’s so sad when our time together is over. I almost find myself...grieving. However, I wouldn’t change a thing and will go through the sadness over and over for the memories!
1	Now at 25, they get me some what stressed. All the gift buying and events can be overwhelming. As an ENFJ, my organization skills REALLY come in handy this time of year. I try to remember the true meaning of Christmas and do get excited to see friends and family.
1	17. Absolutely love holidays and Christmas. The only time I'll get stressed about them is when one of my parents are stressed.
1	they definitely stress me out because i don't like breaks in my routine. i'm a college student so i basically just come home and do nothing. i get so off track with everything going on in my life + get depressed because i have a very broken family
1	Bit of both.\n\n I like seeing family I haven’t seen in a while. And food and drink is my jam!  I’m getting better at setting boundaries and increasing my own self confidence so I just don’t do forced interactions. Or I will just let interactions be awkward and allow the feelings to just be. \n\nWe do secret Santa so I just buy one present for my family. my husband sorts out his family. And I have a price limit on my sons present. \n\nWe’ve driven 6-8 hours for the past three Xmas’s so we stayed at home this time. \n
1	I love the holidays, exchanging presents and even interacting with people I haven't seen in a while or with which I don't see eye to eye... there's always something to talk about and have a nice time.\n\nI just make sure I have done all my gift shopping/wrapping early on because the last days before Christmas are hectic in the streets. That's it.
17	Do ENFJ's have a lot of depth?	I'm just curious to know what other MBTI types have a lot of depth. I, myself, am an INTJ.\n\nDo you see yourselves with simple needs and desires? Or do you find yourselves to be pretty complicated? Do you guys wonder about the universe, humanity, and how things are connected? What goes on in your mind or heart?
32	I would consider myself a very complex individual. Because of this, I’m also not good with surface level relationships/conversations. I enjoy pondering and discussing very deep subjects involving philosophy and theology and all kinds of science. \n\nBecause of my complex personality, when it comes to things like politics, I find it very hard to “pick a side.” I consider myself independent that sits smack-dab in the middle of the spectrum. When it comes to deep discussions involving philosophy, theology, politics, etc., my answers many of the times can be complicated. Most real world issues cannot be solved by picking either ‘a’ or ‘b.’ I don’t like to see the world in black or white; the world is grey, and everyone sees it in a different shade. \n\nThat being said, I realize that many people’s personality do not allow them to have a complex nature. Most people (from my own experience) refuse to think in complex ways, hence why the two party system is so popular in America. \n\nWhen discussing complex issues and exploring the mind of another individual, I find myself being very empathetic towards the others feeling and perspectives. Empathy and humility are key components in these discussions. \n\nAs an extroverted individual, I also find it very easy to explain my thoughts and feelings on complex topics and issues. Some people may be very complex and think in complex ways, but their personality makes it difficult for them to express those thoughts or feelings. \n\n
7	Yes as an ENFJ I do have a lot of depth. Many people see us as very positive, outgoing, and helpful people which I do take pride in. However I have my struggles, my pasts that have molded me, and my insecurities. In the same way, I have a vision of how I want the world to be and how to lead people to become the best versions of themselves because doing so helps me realize who I am. \n\nThere’s always more than what appears on the outside 
5	I find that I am always thinking of new ways to experience the world and new ways to interact with the people I care about. This means yes, I am constantly occupied with thoughts of the universe, humanity, and how things are connected -- almost to the point where I can get lost in my own head about it. I have been told countless times throughout my life something like "I've never met anyone who has so many odd things and/or coincidences happen to them!" and I'd like to think that it's because I strive to put myself out there (with a lot of enthusiasm) to experience and understand new experiences and people. I love connections, whether it be with people or through the relation of ideas. 
3	I’m an INTJ. Yes ENFJ have a lot of depth: more than most other types as I’ve come to interact with them.
2	I'm an INFJ, my husband is an ENFJ, yes. They have a lot of depth haha. 
2	I don't know that its within anyone to consider whether or not they have "depth."  
2	I quite often have to refrain from diving deep in every possible scenario and it tires me to stay on the surface for too long. Life is complex and deep and we are in the fabric of it. If you get an enfj talking through issues with you, you’re in for a treat.
0	I know 2 ENFJs and I haven't seen either of them be terribly deep. They just care about harmony.\n\nMe: "What are your thoughts on transgenderism/religion/politics/etc?"\n\nENFJ: "I don't really care. I just want people to do what makes them feel fulfilled."\n\nAny conflict comes up and they start losing it.
22	We’re building a dating site!	We're building a dating site for people who are into personality theory. Because we believe compatible personality types have better chances of relationship success over the long term. Right now I'm looking for more NF types to test drive the site. A large number of INTPs are already on board -- a type that has been shown to be a great match for ENFJs -- but we still need a few more ENFJs to balance things out. Feel free to take [our quick 5 point survey ](https://melentp.typeform.com/to/EvaKNM) if you think you'd like to get involved. And thanks so much 💕❤️💕\n
3	i'll do it! good luck ladies ;)
2	As an INFP, i would like to support this :)
1	Thank you so much for filling out our questionnaire!! \nI’m aware we haven’t been able to answer all the questions you’ve had- we are still in the beginning phase and reading your feedback is very valuable to us!\n\nFollow up info will be coming in the new year. \n\n🎉🎉🎉
1	I would really like a dating site that makes personality the primary matching component. I am a new systems software engineer and while I am not interested in working for the development of the dating site as a hire, I would be happy to give advice or do testing. For better or worse, due to my online dating experiences, I have some general view points on dating sites to offer as well. @r/annaINFJ\n\n\n\n\nP.S: I admit that I have been hovering over this subreddit because I am beginning to believe that an ENFJ would be the ideal partner for me. If someone wants to chat with a random bored redditor, pm me.
1	Done and done 
1	Done!
-1	I predict this will fail miserably.\n\n* Over half of self-typed people are mistypes, either intentional or unintentional. "Professionally" typed isn't much better.\n\n* MBTI type compatibility is all wrong. MBTI itself is mostly garbage.\n\n* Dating sites are overwhelmingly occupied by INFs. Online dating is an INF interest and their preferred form of dating. Besides them there are some ENFs and very few other types. Because of this I'm guessing over 90% of your "INTP"s are mistyped INFs. INF->INTP is a very common mistype.\n\n* People (mostly INF) will lie about their type in order to date types they find attractive.\n\nIf it were up to me I would shut down your attempt at building the site. Since I don't think this will stop you however, you should know that the real compatible types or "golden pairs" are NT with NT, SF with SF, and Feeler with Feeler. *Maybe* ENF with IST but I'm not sure about that one. Other than that it's every type with it's own type ignoring the J/P distinction.
6	Am I the only ENFJ who hate texting?	As every ENFJ I love to communicate but I prefer the personally way.  When I chat I do not know what to respond, I'm afraid that I can't see the other's face and I can not hear her voice. How can I learn to chat?
6	i relate to this a little bit, i feel much less comfortable trying to read someone’s reaction over text and gauge an appropriate response, especially if i’m communicating with a boss, professional colleague etc. i don’t think this is necessarily unique to ENFJ’s, but i feel you. the only person i genuinely enjoy texting with is my wife, but even then far and away our primary communication is in person which i definitely prefer. texting has its place, but i definitely prefer talking in person.
3	I honestly hate texting. I love talking with people in person, but otherwise it’s horrible. I’ve learned to just respond with my first thought and it seems to be better than putting it off.
2	Texting is lame. Can’t gauge tone or subtle voice inflections to identify meaning. 
2	I don't hate it but I don't love it either. Maybe try to write the way you speak (?)
2	i'm the same way. i would much rather communicate with someone in person or over a phone call. for me personally, when people text me, i typically ignore it until they call me (most of my friends know to do this now haha) or until i see them in person. if this cannot happen, then i usually just wait a few hours to make sure i don't text something impulsively...because if i do, many times i wind up being upset with whatever i said or think of something better that represents more of what i actually meant to say.
1	I also hate texting. Speaking aloud is so much more personable. 
1	Yes
1	I hate texting if i could meet up with someone instead but i'm perfectly fine with it if someone is either too busy or on the other side of the country
1	Absolutely suck at texting. I try to always check in my friends or I like to randomly text them nonsense so to make them laugh. I also think it’s important who you chat with. If you enjoy Chatting with the person it makes everything easier. 
9	I am struggling.	INFP here. I am in love with an ENFJ. We were extremely close for months. We texted all day every day.  \n\nBut she lives far away so she didn't want a relationship.   \n\nTime passed and she slowly grew away from me. She doesn't have time for me like before.   \n\nWe used to chat on WhatsApp but I uninstalled the app. I told her I had to pull away because I couldn't manage my emotions with her.   \n\nI told her she could contact me on another app if she needed to.   \n\nMonths went by an she slowly started contacting me again.  \n\nBut obviously the time I get from her is never enough.      \n\nI try to put thought into whatever I message her but I feel our conversations are superficial.   \n\nI don't like meaningless chatting. Which only makes me try harder. \n\nNow I'm back not being able to control myself with her.     I am the needy one in this relationship and I don't like feeling needy.   I don't know what to do.  This is the best friendship/relationship I've had in years and it's also been the hardest.  \n\nThank you for listening. I needed to get these words out and I can't turn to her. You guys are the closest thing. \n\n\n  \n\n
7	firstly , sorry you’re going through this . i feel your frustration . unfortunately it seems like she’s moved on . openly discussing your feelings with her in all this might shed some light on her side of the relationship , even if what she says is painful to hear. at least you can get closure if that’s the case . hope this helps and good luck
3	Just cause you’re not in a relationship with her doesn’t necessarily mean you have to give up the friendship. Maybe the timing isn’t right. There could be many reasons. I don’t think you should completely cut her off but If she’s worth it, I say you should stick along. Idk maybe that’s just me :3  good friendships are hard to find. 
2	she might just want to stay low-key friends only, and it might be up to you to decide if you want to continue this way or not. not easy, i know..
93	Synonym: ENFJ	
5	so arrogant haha y'all are good people and I'm enfj myself but come on lol
3	Also compersion :)
2	Wow that will be my top favorite word in "describe yourself"
19	Estimating my top student's type correctly felt helpful towards building a relationship. :) Fellow ENFJ's know the feeling!!	
6	I’m sure we (ENFJs) are some of the best at guessing MBTIs due to our strong ability to read people!  I have guessed most people’s right in the past as well; I def know the feeling as you said!  
4	Long Distance Relationship /w 8 hour distance	What are you guys like when you're in a long distance relationship? If you are in school or have a job that keeps you busy that would be even better
3	Oooooh baby! I go CRAAAAZY!\n\nTo be more specific, I am in the military and am away from my wife for 3 months at a time at sea. I THRIVE off of emotional relationships. So what ends up happening is that I form one or two crushes. Hard.\n\nI will get an intense crush on a shipmate. Now dont get confused, I still love my wife and would never cheat on her. But man oh man I can literally feel my heart start aching in my chest.\n\nI try to counteract this a number of ways. For one, I realize that this is brought on by the human need for physical contact. As you can imagine, purposeful human physical contact is not abundant in a military setting.  I also realize that what is going on is an altered state of thinking. It is colloquially known in my branch as "cutter brain". In short, it's where you just ain't thinking right.\n\nI also counteract this by writing to her as much as possible. I know that what is happening is that my brain is searching for an emotional surrogate to substitute my wife. \n\nBut yeah, there's your answer.
1	i was in a long distance relationship when i was in high school (decade ago). Like, across the country type thing. I would text/message the person constantly, we'd talk most nights if we could. When we met up a few times per year we'd do everything we possibly could together. \n\nIdk, do you have more specific questions? I liked to know the day-to-day details with the person as though I was physically involved in their life, even though I wasn't. Helped both of us (or at least me) feel more secure, we eventually went to college together. 
1	I’ve been in multiple long distance relationships in the past, different college and different cities later. One thing I know for sure it was never the distance that made us break up. 
1	ENFJ & ESFJ couple personality changes	[Edit : From my current vantage point, I’m starting to think the default, “stereotype” state of an ENFJ isn’t all that great because it requires an immense amount of energy and leads to subsequent stress.\n\nI wonder if there are specific attributes we need to get rid of (or improve on) in order to become a well balanced, healthy ENFJ?]\n\nPreamble : I’m an ENFJ male who recently retook the MBTI test and got an ENTJ (56% T),\nand my girlfriend is an ESFJ who also retook the test and got an ENFJ (56% N).\n \nI just found it fascinating how we influenced each other’s test results in the span of a few months. \nI might be wrong, but I read somewhere that ENFJ’s are the most “chameleon-like”, and ESFJ’s are the most open to “N-perception” out of all the S types.\n\nME : I know at heart I’m a hardcore ENFJ, but I really tried to become more S-like in order to connect with the 82% population of S’s. (The global average is 75%, but the statistics in my country indicate 80~83% of people are S’s..🙁) I’ve gotten more interested in fashion, everyday dynamics, details related to the five senses, etc.\n\nI’ve also consciously tried to improve myself to the point where I think I’ve managed to balance out my function of T and F.\nFor instance, I no longer waste my time fretting over people around me who just don’t have the damn capacity to change, nor do I feel any remorse not helping them.\nIt’s not that I’ve become ruthless, it’s just that I’ve come to fully realize certain hereditary and environmental limitations. (I just need to find more effective ways to brighten up the world while not wading through other people’s emotional excrement😂)\n\nGF : She is still quite rooted in the here and now, but I’ve noticed that her interest in abstract concepts, possible alternatives for social systems, the future of our human race, etc dramatically increased a couple months into our relationship. \nAfter she had been sufficiently exposed to my various methods of analysis, I believe she started to realize the value of a more intuitive approach to situations. \nFor example, she tries to connect behaviors and motives on a larger scale and identify patterns that weave into a tapestry of an underlying vision of how the world ought to be.\n\nConclusion : My GF has become intellectually “deeper”.\nI’ve become more materialistic and insensitive. \nWait, that’s not right.🤔\nI’ve become more (...struggling to find the right sugercoating) pragmatic and attuned to my own needs.\n\nSeriously though, I’m less weighed down by other people and I’m significantly happier in my everday life. 
1	I was an ENFP before meeting my now wife. Retook the test a couple months ago and am now an ENFJ. I believe the people you surround yourself with can certainly change you fundamentally. You take on some of their habits and traits without realizing it. We often mold to better the fit the company we choose. At least that has been my observation of my own life.
21	Always thought Dany was ENFJ and Jon was INFJ but would love to hear everyone’s thoughts if you follow the show/books	
4	I never trust these charts with all the little boxes and pictures :D they're usually wrong in my opinion. Try https://funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/, that is a great site and it has thousands of characters typed. They do it pretty well in my eyes.
9	I've seen lots of charts, both of them are usually typed as INFJs or INFPs. \nIn my opinion Daenerys is an ENFJ and Jon an INFP.  
1	Danny is an infp and Jon is an infj. No way either of them are extroverts 
1	Lol if aria is infp then Oprah is intp 🤣
1	Cersi isn't an ESFJ.  Shes a Te dom all the way, not Fe. 
20	ENFJ's communication skill	ENFJ's level of communication is sooo sexy to me as an ENFP. Mmm! You guys know what you are doing ^^
17	The trick is being able to effectively fake it. Heh.
14	I usually listen to people\nAnd then i talk by references (referring to their talks and stories)\nAnd everyone loves it
5	It’s what I’m most proud of so I appreciate it! What specifically have you noticed in the ways ENFJs communicate?
0	friend enfj giving unsolicited advice? Is this an enfj thing?	My friend enfj  gives unsolicited advice and i sometimes wonder if he is aware that she is annoying me or not. For instance, i got a new job and she is really happy about it but then she told me that i should always keep my phone on because chances are a boss might call me unexpectedly. I just said thank you but inside i wanted to tell her bluntly how annoying she can be but i didnt do it because who knows she is sensitive. I mean i know what Im doing duh. She sometimes gives advice i dont even need . Some say she is only caring but i call this obnoxious and invasive ( sorry bout that).\n\nYou know she once confessed me that she left her old job because her co workers mistreated her like they would make unsolicited snarky comments to her or unsolicited opinions. She told me she hates being "controlled". She told me that they have no right to tell her what to do but she is CONTRADICTING herself (inferior Ti i guess)  by giving unsolicited advice to me like she knows better. I think she is blind to her contradictions but i dont wanna confront her.I have to admit she doesnt know her boundaries haha\n\nactually my friend is a gay male so i called her she\n\nisfj here btw
13	ENFJ male here. I think the answer lays with your question. As an extrovert I like some degree of control of the people around me so I try to gently nuge them in a direction I think is best for them.\n\nEven though you have the situation under control. None can read your mind :)\n\n\nTry to open up to her about how you feel, or how she makes you feel when she gives you advice. Be candid. You might be pleasantly surprised by us ENFJs :)\n\n
8	why do you call gay males she
5	typical assertive value system. when a person has higj selfesteem and thinks he has something valuable to share. he will. thats how our species evolved. there is no sensitivity and mind reading bullshit. its inefficient to consider that vs handle the outcome
5	I can't speak to anyone's experience other than my own, but personally if I was doing something to annoy or offend a friend, especially if I was doing it repeatedly, I WOULD WANT TO KNOW - so that I could "fix" it and repair the relationship. That's what's important to me as an ENFJ - relationship harmony and lack of conflict. By not letting your friend know how you feel, you're just allowing yourself to become more resentful. And clearly your friend is unaware that this annoys you, otherwise they probably would have stopped doing it. So the next option for both of you is to just be honest. I could assume that your friend would appreciate the honesty - I know that I would. That's what real friendships are based on. 
8	> but i dont wanna confront her \n\nThen what are you going to do about it? Stay upset every time it happens? Just be straightforward\n\n> is a gay male so I call her she\n\nC’mon man...
4	If you are expecting him to realize what he's doing by himself, you are setting him and yourself up for a nasty fallout. \n\nWhen I feel comfortable with someone, I expect them to be honest and direct with me, because I hate to be guessing all the time. It is tiring.\n\nIf you let this go on indefinitely, you will end up exploding and he'll be hurt, because you let him be annoying to you, didn't trust him to tell him how you felt and kept pretending with him that everything was alright when it wasn't.\n\nYou don't have to be particularly harsh. You can just say: "You know, x, thank you, I appreciate it, but I know what I am doing. Really, I am an adult. I can manage."
11	To be fair, your repeated use of “she” to refer to a gay male is probably even more annoying and offensive. I feel like you should have caught yourself the first time but you used it throughout. 
116	2meirl4meirl	
11	I feel personally attacked.
11	Someone has to
8	oof.
4	Saw this in the ENFP subreddit and was just waiting for it to get posted here hahaha
6	what makes you feel safe in a relationship?	
17	Transparency 
8	Head pats and hand holding <3
3	Trust that is built on honest and open communication. 
3	when they check up on how i'm doing and genuinely care. also when they are honest and open about themselves and how they are feeling.
1	Dogs
14	How does Ti work for you?	As the title implies. How does Ti manifest itself consciously in your decision making? Does it feel like a helper or a hindrance? How do you think optimized Fe-Ti would look for you?
22	I would say superficially, when I was in school, I always leaned towards the sciences and math. I wouldn't say I excelled at them, but I had a strong curiosity for understanding how things worked and the theory behind them. I almost always wanted to understand the theory because if I knew the theory, I could apply the framework to other scenarios. It gave me a heuristic to rely on. I continue to really enjoy continuous learning because I enjoy self-improvement and being more knowledgeable and skillful (e.g. I'll watch random youtube videos to learn economics even though it has nothing to do with my day job because I want to learn something for the sake of it).\n\nAt work, it causes me to overanalyze almost every intellectual problem I come across, and leads me to be perfectionist. When I approach a problem, I do so holistically and constantly say, "well what about X? Y? Z?" I sometimes get paralysis by analysis because I can see the merit/detriments to everything, and feel unable to make a firm decision of how to proceed. It's where I rely on my more firmly logical colleagues to support my decision-making process. Conversely, I think I help these colleagues see every possible way of viewing a scenario. While I am very social, I like having dedicated blocks of time where I can sit and think through a problem alone, do research and then brainstorm with colleagues about the best solution after. \n\nWhen an issue arises at work, I work hard to solve the issue at hand and then figure out the underlying issue so it can be avoided. \n\nIn my personal life, when I am having an emotionally laden conversation, I am very particular about questions I ask and the words I use. When someone comes to me with a struggle they have, I often ask questions that are non-judgemental or leading to get them to consider the alternative to a scenario, for example: if a friend came up to me ranting about a friend who they had perceived wronged them, I would respond, "why do you think Susie would do that?". I want them to really think about why someone would act in a certain way - was it because she was being truly spiteful, or was she just very busy? I contextualize everything because hearing anything from one side isn't always an accurate representation of the facts. Around strong T-types, I actually very much enjoy arguing and debating because I like making people consider the alternatives. \n\nWhen people ask me questions about how I feel, I very often ask them to elaborate on the question so I don't screw up the response and answer something completely different from what they are asking. For example, if a potential romantic partner asked me, "How do you feel about us?" and there was ambiguity in the situation, I would say, "Feel in what way? Right now? How I would want our relationship to proceed? You'll need to be more specific." It very much bothers me when people use imprecise language in emotional contexts because words really convey a lot of meaning, and I don't like misunderstandings as a result of these careless or not well-thought out word-selection. \n\nTi expresses itself in different ways depending on the context. In my work life it can be tricky but helpful, in the ways I listed above. In my personal life, I often find it searching for the truth in my personal relationships (makes me curious about who people are truly are) or when my friends come to me with a problem. It has a hard to time dealing with duplicitousness or hypocrisy (I can smell that shit a mile away, but my Fe will sometimes counteract that, especially if it means I need to play nice in a social situation... but doesn't necessarily mean I'm happy doing that!!).
13	I notice Ti work a couple of ways for me.\n\nThe Good:\n— When intellectually curious about something, I can dive deep into the details and I enjoy problem solving and challenging statements that seem off using research and logic. Also a perfectionist when it matters like with my writing in school.\n\n— I have a need to be intellectually stimulated and  I am eventually turned off by people/experiences that fail to produce that in at least some way.\n\n— If I take the time to be introspective and I challenge myself to “turn off the Fe” I can use Ti to see the stark reality of a situation. Takes much longer than using Ni to imagine how the situation could be.\n\nThe Bad:\n— I OVERTHINK a lot, it’s almost like my Ti fires out of control sometimes and I can spiral to a dark place. My internal thoughts can get the best for me — was worse as a kid, better control now.\n\n— I can’t use Ti quickly, so I over compensate and sometimes state things as fact without thinking them through thoroughly.\n\n— When stressed I’ve noticed Ti almost becomes impossible and I make even rasher decisions that I may later regret.
35	Broken enfj	Hey all. I love all the positive energy here, it’s helps a ton for help guide what what strengths might be and how I affect people. The only issue is I think I’m broken. \n\nNot sure if it was 1 thing or just a build up of emotion that I buried down. Over the past 6-7 years I’ve realized that I still act often times like I’m fine on the surface. My biggest goal is just to be happy and be around happy people by being a good friend/sibling/mentor but I rarely feel like anyone has any idea who I actually am or what’s important to me. In most cases conversations never center around myself own thoughts and even when they do I feel misunderstood. \n\nI know it can seem sometimes surface level that everything is fine but that is simply because we don’t want anyone else to see or feel this pain. My solution was the bury it all down inside me and avoid going to places I don’t want in my mind. While that did work externally and I can carry out life seemingly normal, it just made me feel more isolated and misunderstood. \n\nNow I feel like I’m about to boil over and this pent up energy is going to come out somehow and I’m scared of what it might bring. Honestly not sure if anyone has had remotely the same feeling before but this is a place where I think there’s a chance to be understood. \n\nM29-ENFJ
14	I do the same thing, it's really unhealthy though, by trying to keep the peace, I end up mentally exhausted and stressed. You should try and talk to someone you trust about what's bothering you, writing it down also helps. \nLittle by little try to stop accumulating things you're building up, whether it's by saying "no" or putting yourself first. We have to be selfish sometimes, we also deserve to have people here for us. We tend to feel like we're the ones who HAVE to be here for others, but we also need to be comforted. \nIf I feel like what I've build up would only hurt those around me if I were to tell them, I sometime talk about it to random people online to let it out.  \nAs a random person online, I can tell you that you're a great person, and you deserve a break. \n\nI hope you feel better soon !
8	OMG The more I read these posts the more I feel normal. I know intimately how you feel but let me tell you that you are not broken. Not at all. Bent maybe, but you are not broken. I don't know your circumstances nor do I know your situations but it appears this is just the way we cope. If you exercise it helps. I love to walk and hike and even bike. A motorcycle is the BEST therapy. ENFJs are actually charged by being needed and feel wanted and helping but ...it does take its toll. We have a habit of staying in an emotionally draining situation so long it sucks our souls dry. Sadly, I always feel like there is no one there for me. And more sadly, no one seems to get the Freaking hint. I, like most ENFJs, do not ask for help, My best friend rarely if ever talks to me after me giving this person tons of help over the years. I don't know how to cope with my overwhelming sadness, so yeah, I get you. I have learned the hard way that I have to ask for help. Because it is so natural for me to intuit the needs in others doesn't mean that hey will ever see my need. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou have many potential friends on this board. Let me suggest getting to know some of them but also getting to know a more logical personality type. They really do help bring balance. 
7	31/F. ENFJ. \n\nSeriously, give therapy a try.\n\nI have been affected by depression for 15 years. It's really difficult to accept. There past 10 years I've developed anxiety (gad) too.\n\nI feel like I'm a broken enfj because I feel for everyone so much, have a lot of empathy, am always striving to help others, and constantly feel like I'm giving all of my self away, nearly to the point of resentment. I also feel lost, go through periods of time when I feel like I've lost my identity and personality, that I don't know where I'm going or why. I have a lot of similar feelings to the ones you've described.\n\nIf you don't feel like you have a person in your life you can confide in without feeling shame or judgement, go to therapy. If you have shitty healthcare, there are solutions out there. But getting it out of your mind, out of your mouth, is the first step. (In the mean time, journaling regularly can help you get it out, while also helping you to recognize patterns of when you feel this way). Burying things is never the answer; it stretches to avoidant behavior, and you'll only feel more isolated and misunderstood.
6	M25 ENFJ, \n\nSimilar to you, I've been able to swallow my emotions for years and kept happy appearances, until I finally reached my breaking point in spring this year. Do to exams, group projects and some very uncooperative group mates, I got extremely emotionally worn out, plus I had to deal with family matters and I got diagnosed with heart arrhythmia, which flared up with stress. At some point I just completely broke down in front of my parents, and was forced to face the fact what I was doing was too much for me to handle and not very healthy in the slightest. \n\nAs with you, I was trying to be a good friend/son/sibling/support; I just did what I had to do to fulfill my part in other peoples lives without really thinking about what I wanted or needed. During night out in August, with a good friend of mine, we met a young soldier in his early 30's with PTSD at a bar. He told us a story about his pilgrimage on the  Camino de Santiago and how the solitude of the trip had helped to come to the realization of who he was. At some point during the evening he asked if I wanted go outside and have smoke, which I agreed to. He told me, that he could feel that I wasn't really being myself (Which is to say, happy, outgoing, emphatic self I wore that evening) and he proceeded to ask me "Who are you? Who is 2point1?". The question caught me by surprise and a sudden feeling a deep emptiness rushed over me, as I tried to find a genuine introspected answer for him. I started to cry. This feeling of overwhelming sadness and loneliness is, what I realize now, the emotions I kept down for so long. The soldier comforted me until felt better and we parted ways with a hug later that night.\n\nI consider this to be my breakthrough in this whole mess of things. It is extremely harrowing to look inwards and find that there is nothing there, because you simply forgot to think about your own needs and goals. I was lucky enough that a complete stranger instigated this very powerful cathartic reaction, which put me in a place where I could more clearly see myself outside of other peoples lives and start to work on myself. I am still in the process of figuring everything out and I am by no means done (And i don't think I'll ever be), but I feel so much stronger than before.\n\nSetting boundaries is hard, telling people what you need is hard and finding peace with not pleasing everyone around you is especially hard. But you will find that, you will create stronger relationships and more mutually beneficial bonds with people around you. Doing this will by extension weed out unhealthy relationships. Those around you who only 'take' without returning, will automatically leave you as they won't get whatever they are used to. They might become angry or disappointed an tell you that you have changed, but it is better in the long run, in my experience anyway.\n\nSomeone in the comments suggested therapy, which I think is a great option! If you don't have anyone in your life that you can totally confined in, having a shameless talk with a stranger where you have zero obligations, is a totally fine alternative. \n\nI don't know you or your life. I have no idea if what you are feeling is similar to what I have experienced or if my story helps you in anyway. You sound like an awesome guy and I don't think you are broken at all! You are doing your best, but is sounds like you are neglecting yourself in the process. I wish you all best, stay good and stay strong man!
5	I can relate and it’s rough. The most minor thing sets me off because I’m depressed. I’m sad I’m making others sad or hurting others because I’m hurting. I signed up for therapy I’m going on Saturday, I’m hoping it helps, if anything it will help me cope. I notice my relationships are hurting bad because I’m hurting and I feel I’ll lose a friend or worse my girlfriend. It just plain sucks sometimes and I’m here to tell you you’re not alone, it’s a heavy burden to feel the emotional toll of others all the time, I’m hopping to manage my own to help others as well. Here’s to healing. 
4	I think it's a great first step to type this all out :) I know the feeling too well- this pent up energy has led to mini-explosive tantrums in my life that I am not proud of at all. An ENFJ tends to walk the paths with a lot of other people but others rarely come close to walking on ours. And that can lead us to being liked but still lonely.\n\nMy suggestion would be to open up to one or two people who won't judge you for how you really think. It sounds like you've brought happiness to others and I'm sure many would happily reciprocate. Otherwise, you could perhaps confide in a counselor. Best of luck buddy.
2	I'm going through the same thing right now & its been going on for about 3 yrs. I dont have suggestions on what do to,  You're not alone. I have distanced myself from everyone I know to protect myself & them from me. When you're misunderstood  it makes trusting anyone feel impossible. I am having better days, they're not great, just noticeable. I wish I had something more like sunshine to give you, just know you may not be all that misunderstood 😊 
2	Sorry to hear that bro\nThat's just sooo ENFJ to not speak our minds.\nIt's pride (: \nI tell myself people done really care or want to know the real me. \nAnd bro g surrounded by ppl who don't love me and want me is really sad. \nThat's why I just try to be with ppl who do actually want to know me, because they want me in their lives. 
2	I think you are great and those pressures you put on your self and that’s okay because that means your driven. Just be gentle with your self 
3	Fe doms, please help an INTP out	https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/a5d8i1/fi_is_seemingly_better_than_ti_for_finding/\n\nIt is long. I apologize. I am not understanding Fe in its entirety. I am trying to work through Jung's original writing about it but it is often confusing to me. It seems Fe has transcended Fi in some context and within that area is the difference in goals between the Ti dominant and the Fi dominance(holistically speaking).\n\nIn what way do Fe and Ti balance one another? How does Fe and Te differ from one another?\n\nFi is being defined as "the feelings of an individual produced by the relation to the object", so it seems Fe has transcended individual happiness on some level, even accounting for individual happiness produced by any behavior. It honestly seems like it is paradoxical to what I know about the self and how the self relates to that which is external(im Ti dominant so I suppose this makes sense?). Fe sounds like a value that does not depend on the self's experience at all.\n\nIn other words...it seems Fe doms don't have emotions of their own. Their emotions are the emotions prevalent in the object itself.
6	Fe doms do have emotions of their own, everybody has. The difference is on the level of awareness of one's own emotions. Extroverted feeling means precisely that the focus of attention is outside. We are good at reading other people's emotions, not so good at reading our own.  I can, for example, surprise myself talking in an aggressive way to someone, and then ask myself "I am upset today. Why?" and need to do some introspection about what could be causing that state of mind in myself.\n\nIn my experience, Ti is the voice that says "this person is SO WRONG in so many levels, destroy them with logic" and Fe is saying "You know that in the end that isn't productive, you wouldn't like to be treated like that yourself. Is there something you can agree with? How can you tell them the same thing but in a polite way?"\n\nAs for Fe vs. Te... I think it comes down to different perspectives regarding efficiency. Fe is confident that if people agree, things will run faster and smoother and emotional toil will be avoided. Te doesn't care that much if someone is upset in the end, as long as the task is completed in the most straightforward and less resource-consuming way.
1	>In what way do Fe and Ti balance one another?\n\nI'm not sure if I know how they balance each other, but I can mention how they work differently. Its kinda like this. I have a high Fe low Ti. Using the Ti takes effort and is hard, its not what I want to do all the time and usually I'll be using this at work (and thus mentally a bit exhausted afterwards). When i'm with friends I'm a go with the flow type of person, I just want good times and everyone to be happy. If a question comes up about where we want to get food (for example) I'm not going to have any strong views myself but I might take charge of the process because I will use my Fe to make sure the group is happy with the decision. If anyone asks me where I want to go my answer will *generally* be "whatever the group wants, I'm not picky", even if the group decides on a place that I don't care for.\n\nRelated to your question on how Fe and Te differ, someone using Te to lead a decision making process on where to go to eat is going to be more focused on what makes the most sense rather than making sure everyone is happy. This isn't to say the outcome will be different, just that their process is different. \n\nThen related to your final bit about Fe doms not having emotions of their own, yeah I think you understand it. When I'm alone I don't all of a sudden know how I'm feeling just because people aren't around. Generally the feeling I would describe as my default is just contentment or very zen, this is if I don't have any anxiety I'm carrying around. I will shape my environment to give me a pleasant experience (whether thats cleaning or decorating), and I will use media to give me other feelings (social media, music, tv, internet). \n\nThe problem arises when I try to use Ti to figure out *what I want to watch* because I truly do not know and do not care. It doesn't stop me from spending an hour+ looking through various streaming services in the hopes of somehow discovering what it is I want to watch. I really just want something fun. I usually end up rewatching stuff I've already seen because I know I enjoy it. 
1	i agree with ur statement. fe dont have emotions of their own. but we have all functions, > everyone has Fi. and all functions jumble per context
7	enfj girl + infp guy = harmonious relationship (imo)	
15	Sometimes when I do get asked	
36	Don't you all have this thing by which you present at first like more reserved and proper and then once you get comfortable with someone start showing your extra/sarcastic/intense/improper side and people react like you sprung a second head?
8	This is the best, yeah just hold on while I observe the f out of you... okay here’s crazy me, you’ve unlocked it fellow human 
5	I like to pretend I am like the video game super smash brothers. You gotta unlock all my characters before I really open up haha
3	I've noticed that when I meet new people, I'm usually the one that listens to the other person and let them narrate their life. Once I get a good feel of them as a person then I start getting invested in the person and talk my head off about anything that comes to mind. Always surprises people the more they get to know me and usually I get the "you know when we first met, I thought you were an introvert but now I know you're such a chatterbox!" 
2	I guess I have never noticed it as much but I am realizing this is very true. I hate for people to push their "friendship" upon me. But Yeah, I don't react well in first encounters. But let me get my "feeldar" going and I may open a floodgate. 
1	Not mutually exclusive though :p
1	Is it just me or does anyone else HATE when someone either asks if you are/calls you shy upon meeting you? It's like, uhhh noooo I'm not shy, I just met you a little bit ago so I can I be all talkative with someone who I just met/hardly know? Get to know me more and you'll think different lol
27	I know way to many people and I think it's becoming a bit of a nuisance	Hi guys, I'm an 18 year old freshman college student, I made a test a few days ago and it said that I am an ENFJ type person, so here I am.\nAnyways ever since starting college 4 months ago I am a pretty good socialiser, and at this point everyone knows me. The problem is that people come up to me at uni and wanna talk but I either wanna focus on the person I'm talking to right now or I just completely don't remember them. So I wanted to ask how you guys remember everyone around, there names and other stuff like that?\n\nHave a nice days and take care!!
19	My husband is ENFJ and sometimes he'll stop and have whole conversations with people and then we'll walk away and he'll be like "I have no idea who that was..." \n\nSo, no advice here, just don't feel bad about it. 
7	I don't know if its because I have ADD or that I am a textbook ENFJ, but I can never remember a name but I never forget a face. I fake it through the conversation. I can say the person's name in conversation when we first meet and tried all the memory tricks but nada. Have courage. Some will get hurt that you forgot their name but they quickly realize that you are genuine and that you care.
6	So ummm, I never really remember people's names if I don't establish a connection to them.\n\nIt's like, if you are talking to someone, the brief sort of introduction is never going to leave any impression. \n\nThe simplest way for this is,\n\n"What's your name again?" \n\n"Martin."\n\n"Cool, Martin, aight, see you around." \n\n:)
3	Write them down in your phone along with how you know them. Otherwise, it's nearly impossible. 
3	I go through phases of meeting and befriending a whole bunch of people but then dropping them off, sometimes keeping maybe 1, but always have my core friends in the background
2	I’m a junior in college now and I’ve had this happen since day 1. I socialized with nearly everyone I ran into and I’m glad I did because I’ve made some great friends because of it. However it’s also weird because there are people I see in passing who are excited and say hi to me but I don’t remember ever even talking to them. \n\nIt gets painful trying to make some small talk but I keep doing it. Even when it comes to waving to people or saying a simple “hey” is tough because I can’t tell how we’ll acquainted I am with that person to acknowledge them mutually in passing. I don’t have a solution for it but I’ll just say it’s not a bad thing. 
1	This happens, and it probably happens to everyone. Few people are the kind that can remember every person they've interacted with, especially when starting college you are bombarded with people, clubs, and activities. \n\nWhen I started college this happened to me, one moment stands out above the rest. Most of the time I can fake through a conversation with someone I don't quite remember as long as I remember some details about a prior interaction, this one time I completely forgot though and this person realized it. I felt like a shitty person for a while because of that, but ultimately it isn't my responsibility to remember everyone I cross paths with. \n\nI wish I could say it gets better naturally, but it will only get better if you work on it. Depending on your future line of work the same thing will happen some day. I work in a relatively small industry and everyone remembers me (because I was new a year ago and therefore easy to remember), but I don't remember everyone else because they're all new to me. So sometimes I forget people who I should definitely remember. The difference now is that the other people are more mature and understand that "just because I forgot you it doesn't mean I think you're worth forgetting", which is what i think it boils down to for younger people. \n\nSo I echo what people say, write them down in your phone or ask again at the end of the conversation for their name. 
1	Personally, I'm really bad with faces, I can talk to someone for really long and have no clue if we met before or not. I try not to worry about it too much, I know a lot of people at uni, but that doesn't mean we have to be super close or anything, we can have a quick chat, and if I feel comfortable, I can just ask them their names. 
1	BTW if you are truly are an ENFJ you will know many, many people and you will be known by many. It's just because we don't meet a stranger. We can and quite often do engage anyone. 
1	repeat their name in your head over and over when they first tell you. also...instagram haha
6	Before Sunrise	[Before Sunrise (1995)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112471/) is a beautiful romantic movie that I recommend all the fellow ENFJs here to watch.\n\nIt's a story about how two people met on a train and just straight up went ahead for a little journey inside Vienna to discover what is to be discovered. The relationship is filled with poems, arts, genuineness and deep connections.\n\nBefore this, I saw many women expecting a romantic relationship shunned by the fact that they couldn't really get one. They believe such genuine connection can only appear in movies, or TV shows.\n\nWith this mentality, they would probably never get one. They complain about no one does such romantic things to them as they probably push every small gesture away in real life.\n\nFor us ENFJs, if there isn't a wonderland, create one. It's that simple.\n\nWhat's unfortunate to see is that most women in real life seem to be just as rigid as possible, leaving no possible leeway for a bit fun and romantic approach. So if you are so rigid, what do you expect to be romantic? Romance means the freedom of expressions, your freedom of love.\n\nWhat I see mostly, is just people get carried away by stupid things in real life and they don't even think twice about it.\n\nWhat I really like about this movie is when Jesse asked Celine out in the train just by a whim, both of them share this eagerness to discover more. When both persons are dreamer personalities, they automatically click.\n\nGive your life a bit leeway, you need it, and others will need it as well. is a beautiful romantic movie that I recommend all the fellow ENFJs here to watch.\n\nIt's a story about how two people met on a train and just straight up went ahead for a little journey inside Vienna to discover what is to be discovered.

34	Dear ENFJ	As an INFP I love ENFJs. I feel like not only can I tell ENFJs all of my thoughts but they make it known that they want to hear my thoughts. It's nice being able to just talk about some of the most intimate thoughts I have with someone.\n\nThat being said, it hurts when ENFJs don't stick around. I had an experience with an ENFJ who I believed to be the best person I have met in my adult life. I was having conversations I hadn't even had with some of my longest and closest friends. \n\nThis person understood me. They gave me advice. It made me feel like they cared about what I was saying and they wanted to help me with my troubles. Every time I would confess emotions or anxieties, I was met with reassurance that it was okay to feel/think what I did. I loved that.\n\nBut then they became more distant. I was even more confused by their responses when I would reach out. They would seem eager in their responses, but lacked availability. I made excuses and told myself they were busy and I should respect that. But with time it became less believable. \n\nIt's been a couple of months and I still think about them. I miss the conversations. It's so easy to get attached to you guys. \n\nEdit: This post was mostly a catharsis for me because this relationship impacted me a lot. I still think the world of ENFJs and can't wait to meet many more in my lifetime. My friend will always be my friend even in distant terms. Thank you all who have offered your personal insight and perspective. It has helped me and I wish everyone here the best!
29	It is easy to promise a lot, but not so often easy to keep the promises. I really want to be there for everyone, but there are so many everyones, and with that I also need to remind myself to sometimes help myself. I am sure this is what happened to your friend as well. I know it's better then to not make promises, but it is often hard to let people down in the short term, not momentarily realising that that is actually more honest and less hurtful. 
12	ENFJ here and I admit that I do ghost. It has nothing to do with the person. It's just that sometimes I find that people's energies are affecting me and I'd like to step back a bit and just take some time for myself. I'm currently ghosting a few/minimizing my talks with folks right now, as I am feeling highly irritated with a lot of things and would prefer to get some me time.\n\nA lot of my folks are SO attached to me as well as they say that I am easy to talk to, empathic and very understanding, etc. Friends attest that it hurts when I walk into their life, hear them out and all of that and then suddenly distance. But again, like you said, it has to do with you being attached to us fellow ENFJ's. We don't do it on purpose though. Sometimes we're so engulfed with stuff in our own life that shit spirals and we want to step back for a bit.\n\nMy suggestion is to straight up ask them what's going on. I sense there's something going on with your ENFJ friend(s)
13	it’s not personal. sometimes i reach an emotional plateau with somebody and i don’t learn more from the relationship . that’s usually when i ghost someone , and it’s not done consciously or maliciously.. it just happens .. moving on from experience to experience is just part of my life. i do remember the good times and should i bump into those people, im genuinely happy to see them. 
5	I just ghosted another job, probably my 15th in five years.  After making really close friends instantly with a good portion of the staff.  I don't want to be like this, but I can never be myself anywhere, so I move on.
6	I can't speak for all ENFJs but I have a detachment disorder. It is a mental thing. If I don't feel loved or respected I detach. I give a lot of the credit of that to my mom raising five kids but mostly to a very emotionally unavailable dad. I get told frequently that I push people away. That is never my intention because my relationships are my treasures. 
4	 Maybe your friend is going through something, you should try and ask them if everything is alright, just show them that you care. \n\n(I know I'm pretty bad at keeping in touch, I think it's because usually people come to me to complain or for help, quite regularly.)\nI hope that you and your friend will be all right. 
3	I'm an ENFJ and I am going through this right now. Not saying this is the reason that your ENFJ left but I related to this post. So my best friend took me in after I asked for a divorce from my husband. I love her to pieces as a person and we considered each other sisters but once I moved in things changed. Now she has turned very selfish and talks down to me. She also likes to put her negativity on me as though it's my fault. As an ENFJ I am very used to bearing others problems and trying to advise others to be the best they can be but lately I cant with her. Her negativity is too heavy for me so I am distancing myself until I get my own place. Maybe we just dont work as roomies but usually I distance myself when people try and put their issues on me. Not saying that's why your friend left I just thought it was interesting.
3	Sometimes I have to step back, because I tend to be the person people talk to when they need cheering up, or a safe place to vent. It can be too much on my heart though. I don't have enough energy to give what people need of me, and still take care of my own insides. I feel bad not being emotionally available. So, I would rather be physically unavailable until I am ready to be the friend my friends need.
3	I know this is slightly old, but I just read through this thread. Whenever I ghost, it’s usually been because I am emotionally exhausted from helping someone who complains about their problems but then doesn’t do anything about them. I end up caring more than THEY care, and that’s difficult for me. \n\nBut I have also ghosted people I care about because my over thinking got the best of me and I created problems in my head where there weren’t any (as it turns out). Then I don’t share because I don’t want to burden anyone. It’s unfair, but I sometimes want someone to do for me like I do for them, but that’s unrealistic, because even though I present like an open book, I only share completely with one person.\n\nYour ENFJ friend might be exhausted and needs to recharge. I hope you can work it all out 😁
2	Yeah, they probably want some space, I don't think there's anything else you can do.
2	This is funny because as an enfj I have a pretty close infp friend and our relationship is exactly like this. Short periods where we are the bestest friends and I give advice and he listens and we joke and everything is fantastic and then long periods where he seems completely uninterested in anything to with me. I have tried talking to him about it but he just shrugs it off like it's no biggie. I've come to accept that maybe that's just how he is but it still affects me. now seeing this post, I dunno maybe there's something about the dynamics of enfj infp relationships that causes this?
2	I had an ENFJ I was close to (INFP myself). But he went from "let's have adventures together" to being very avoidant with me and flaking out on a meeting with me that we had planned for ~10 months. (Different hometowns).\n\nIt hurts because I trusted them and had asked how they felt about me when they said "adventures" and how they wanted to hear stories from me. It was confusing.\n\nI probably should have kept my mouth shut. ;/ I haven't spoken with him in a year because communicating went from close and intimate to brick-wall stiff and impersonal.
2	id say is personal. doesnt mean its deliberate, meaning the person evaluates and maths his way into a hirarchy though that would be ideal imo.  \nattraction is a fragile thing, and idealists swing a lot 
2	Eh. I feel attacked.\n\nI noticed you mentioned how much you emerge able to speak about yourself. How much was ENFJ able to speak about themselves... truly?\n\nYou see, I’ve suffered from suicidal thoughts as an ENFJ and very few people would’ve realised that at the time. When life gets too heavy I shut out people because it’s overly simulating. I can’t sort myself out if my interactions with other people naturally puts me in their shoes. It clouds me from me when I’m not sure of what ‘me’ is or needs to do. If you couple this with the fact that most relationships I build are based around my friends being ‘deep’ and authentic with me it’s just... a lot to handle. \n\nTry not to take it personally, perhaps ask how they are.

1	So,\n\nif they are really busy, I do think they are busy though. At least for me, I don't lie about being busy. \n\nMatter of fact, ENFJs are quite reserved, most of the times it's more like. When I see you are talking to someone, I would not interrupt, and most of times what happens is that, people just leave, and I won't get the time to have a good conversation with them.\n\nWell what can I do, one time, two times, lose interests, alright, no time for me, no time for you, goodbye.

6	Need help with timetable	I figure some of you here have a much better schedule and timetable execution rate than mine, so I'd like to see how you guys do it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor me, personally I do love to plan. However it gets to a point that I can't simply execute it 100% accurately on time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I like to do, is to list down the things I am going to do today, but leave them open. I don't give a strict time rule that I have to finish A before 8, or finish B after 3:30. I feel like flexible is ok, but flexible sometimes doesn't really make me efficient enough, because I procrastinate a lot. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut if I do set a strict time rule, I find myself somehow, in reality, still not being able to meet the time limit. Because in reality there are many unexpectedness happening, but in this case, I do can be more efficient. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo....?
3	Are ENFJ's big planners?  I thought we were more big picture people.  I plan well in the macro, but suck at the micro planning.  That is, until it absolutely matters, then I do it above and beyond.  But not before....
3	[Learn to prioritize](https://servetolead.org/daniel-r-murphy-the-abcd-to-do-list/). List all the things you want to do in a given timeframe, and then label them each Important or Unimportant, and Urgent or Not Urgent. \n\nThen you'll have four categories. Your main focus is obviously going to be to do the important and urgent things first. Then the unimportant and urgent, then important not-urgent, etc. \n\nTake each task you have and break it down into more manageable chunks. Say your goal is "clean my bedroom." That's not much to go on. Make a list.\n\n* vacuum\n* launder linens\n* clean out closet \n\netc. \n\nIf you need to, you can break it down further: \n\nClean out closet: \n\n* go through clothes, separate into keep, donate, storage\n* unpack those boxes that have been there since we moved in\n* add hooks for more hanging storage\n\nOnce you've got small enough tasks, find one that will take you less than five minutes to do. Do it. Cross it off your list. If there's nothing that fits, keep working through the list doing longer tasks, clearing out the category, one category at a time.\n\nYou might not get everything done, but this system makes sure you focus your attention on the most important, most urgent things first, which really is a huge stress reliever overall, in my experience. 
2	I dislike setting artificial time limits on activities or tasks. I think because deep down I know its self-imposed and there are no actual consequences if I don't meet that deadline. It can make getting multiple tasks in a day done tricky though, especially at work. I try not to look at the clock if I need to get things done, and instead just keep doing the things I need to get done until they are...done. I'm not saying its ideal, just what I do. 
18	Do you guys go party a lot?	Just curious, I personally am not really a party person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: \n\nThe input so far is great. So maybe let's define this a bit further: If you do go party, the casual ones or the hyped ones?\n\nI personally do enjoy much more the casual ones than "raves" though.
11	My fiance is an enfj and while she doesn't "party" often she does "go out" pretty often. 
9	Goodness no. \n\nAt 10:15 am today I spent 10 minutes chatting with an associate at a store in the mall, and 4 hours later I'm still high from it. Brief interactions are enough for me. Also, groups over 6 unsettle me because I can't focus my attention on one or two people. Too much flitting around and no real connecting. 
7	I was more of a do drugs in my room by myself type person never liked parties. \nThough now I go out all the time and do stuff and things and it’s great just not parties
7	Depends on the vibe. I generally enjoy warehouse raves and things similar to it. House parties not as much. But overall if I'm with my friends I'll enjoy myself. I'd say I rarely initiate plans to go to a party though.
6	I like parties.  I definitely don't adore them, but I don't hate them.  I like hanging out with friends, but I  really don't like the darkness and loud music that comes with parties.
4	I enjoy places where I can be with my friends with some drinks in our hands. Because of this, I’m not really a dance-and-party person but more of conversation person. Wine nights or brunch days sound amazing to me 
3	Nah I don’t. I like being home
3	If I gave myself the choice more, I'd go to fewer parties. Most of the time I go to them to see people I know and have some fun with them, drinking and clubs come second.\n\nIf we're talking 'partying', again I do it with people and I chip in, but never instigate the idea. Honestly couldn't care less about what we're doing. I don't have that addictive a personality so I never feel like I want to do the drug, just that I don't want to be left out
3	I love parties. it's a chance to meet new people, practice some social skills I'm short on, and get some energy back if I've been lonely. I don't like huge loud ones like raves though, you can't really talk to people.
3	I love parties! However, that’s an obvious solution to how I can typically gather all of my friends within a general interest that everyone can agree on (my friends can usually all agree on going to a bar or something instead of say, a magic show or the renaissance fair). My friends are all verrrrrry different when it comes to their interests and I’m typically the one arranging plans for my loved ones. So parties just happen to be a symptom of my social life. I’m more of an “event” person, and parties just so happen to fall within the umbrella of my social “event” category.
3	Not a lot, but I enjoy it - within reason. Honestly these days more enjoy deep conversations and hanging out with friends.
2	Agreed ENFJs can be reserved but I do LOVE to party. I feel like those are some of the moments im the most tapped into my my Se.
2	Similarly to what others have said, I mainly seek out parties where I can have real interactions. When I was younger (and more than likely an ENFP) I used to love going to loud stranger parties where I knew no one. But as I've grown and shifted more into ENFJ, I find myself daunted with the idea of going to a loud bar with loud music. I like to have real conversations and real quality time with people. Game nights, movie marathons, small birthday parties, those are my jam.
14	ENFJ'S Controlling your emotions	I am very expressive with my emotions. Whether it be happiness, sadness or anger, it is very hard for me to hide my feelings. Sometimes I don't like to show people that I am angered or bothered. How do you suppress your emotions?  How can I be in control? 
8	If my emotions are so strong to the point where they’re visible then I’ll typically isolate myself until I feel better. Journaling really helps me unload and then I read it back to me. Usually I just suppress them by feigning happiness until I can get that alone time.
6	We live in a world were people can't and don't want to understand others. Highly emotional people are seen as over the top. Don't forget how rare you are. Be who you are. You just don't realize how much your ability to emote helps those around you. 
4	You can be in control by loosing control. It is azz backwards I know, but the book that made it all sink in for me was keep your love on, by Danny Silk. This was what worked for me. Hope it helps you in some way. 
3	Being self-aware is the first step. When you feel it coming, either change the subject or walk away for a while. Working on suppression works too. You can adjust better when you know it’s coming.
3	When the emotion is fresh and *toxic* I will try my best to simulate that I'm not phased and repress it, letting it out in privacy one way or another. Takes practice, but you can make the saddest or angriest feeling look like you're mellow
3	supressing emotions is very unhealthy, you need to be able to process the emotions in a healthy way and be able to know when it's ok to behave in whatever situation.  How, would be to accept whatever situatoin happened and to be ok with being frustrated with said situation.  Then let the feelings flow through and it'll be ok. Not ok in a professional situation, only in private.\n\nkey thing is managing your emotions. one can't really control how one feels, but we can control how we handle them.
1	Meditation is my go-to for controlling my emotions. It always helps me take a step back and not let my emotions hijack my thoughts! Headspace is a great app :)

5	AN ENFJ NEEDS HELP WITH A INFP	Hi ENFJs, your type fellow here. I wanted to ask for your help and opinion on a certain problem. Recently I started being interested in an INFP girl from my school. We kinda started talking suddenly with each other and went on ice skating together with some friends but we were together, just us, the whole time. We talked a lot and started to know each other better. Because we are both bi/ gay we shared our coming out stories and stuff. We continued to talk and she saw me of to my apartment even though it was half past one in the morning and she lived 30 minutes away. She told me that she liked me before, but that she has a boyfriend now. She also told me that if she didn’t have a boyfriend the two of us could be a thing. She was all like she wanted me to wait for her kinda. We talked a lot after that and have gotten really close and she invited me to celebrate New Years with her and her friends and she has suggested that we should hang out more. I am pretty confused to say the least because I don’t know what message she wants to send me. I like her a lot, but then again she is in a relationship and I don’t wanna get hurt. I don’t know what to do so any advice or opinion would be appreciated. Also if you need more details about the whole situation feel free to ask. Thank a lot in advance guys
11	Hey, I've dealt with many INFPs in my life to know what they are like. She's not being a player. She's just like that. INFPs get pretty attached once they get closer to someone (and that can happen even in one meeting). If they are securely attracted to you, they will want to do something if the opportunity presented itself. But if they are more loyal to their SO, then they wouldn't try to lure you in. Them inviting you to hang out is not necessarily a sign they wanna get in your pants. They just want to be around someone who they seem they can be loyal to. But that being said, they are highly turbulent and can easily give in to their instincts. So, she might also try to do something unless you really really tell her NO. So, don't confuse the act of inviting you with her being a player because the former can happen just because she likes your company. INFPs very easily trust people and invite them to hang. It's no big deal. You just have to keep your distance and you'll be fine. They are not assertive and can easily tell when someone's not comfortable with them. And they hate that. So, if you really put it out there for her that you don't wanna pursue anything, she won't bother you with it, no matter how much she kills herself for not doing anything. Also, I don't guarantee that she won't be masturbating later to your time together. That's just how some of them are. And she won't tell you, so you'll be fine. XD\n\nJust go and hangout with her. No biggie. 
4	Hi I’m an INFP. She genuinely likes you. She wants to be with you without hurting you or her boyfriend. Be her friend until the opportunity presents itself. She’ll be so happy when you two are together. Be patient! It may happen sooner than later. Trust me, it’s genuine. You got her to open up so that means she really really likes you!!
2	who's to say she wouldn't do the same to you when she finds some new person to mess with
2	She sounds like a player- regardless of anything MBTI related, anyone, regardless of their type, that says "I would be with you if I wasn't with ______" is bad news, because not only is that essentially cheating on their partner by having eyes for someone else but who is to say that, say the two of you were to start to date, that she wouldn't say the same thing to someone else behind your back? I don't think you should pursue anything more than a friendship with her, but if it would be painful to you to only be friends, then I wouldn't even be her friend,  because it sounds like she is almost intentionally leading you on/toying with your feelings.
1	I agree with ther general consensus. I know it's easy to let your heart get wrapped up in another person you enjoy being around. I suggest you keep your heart distant enough to save yourself from the pain. \n\nAlso... don't ever wait for anybody. I wasted years of my life that i will never get back. 
1	Can I ask your age and the girls age? You say you met her in school. Are you referring to high school/college/trade school? 
1	seems like she is leading you on

3	Neil deGrasse Tyson is an ENFJ?	
1	ESFJ, a very intelligent representative of his type.
1	Nope! He’s a textbook ENXP.
11	What's your favorite type romantically?	
25	Whichever type is the most receptive to cuddles (: (and venting).
11	INFP! Great balance. 
8	Lol, I've consistently always been attracted to the "you can absolutely wreck my life in every way" type of individual. But to each their own. 
3	ISFP\n\n1) I have strong Se and I want a partner that has a similar outlook\n2) there's nothing conflicting with my Fe so I get my due chance to take charge\n3) helping my partner develop his Fi is my jam, I want to be assisting the project of his development and well-being
4	ESTJ. Mine keeps me level headed and doesn’t get phased by my emotions.
2	I'm so surprised no one here commented on INFJ... I've read so many good things about this pairing and I'd have to agree 100%. My SO is an ENFJ (M) and I am an INFJ (F)
1	INXX for days
15	My boyfriend is an INTP and we are very compatible. He helps me make rational decisions a lot too because I make a lot of my decisions based upon feelings. He’s extremely empathetic and understanding though compared to the more cold stereotypes they have, so that’s probably why we work well together. 
5	INTP(M) asking for help to understand an ENFJ(F) crush	Hey ENFJs,\n\nFirst of all you are amazing, as an INTP i didn't come across many ENFJs just two, the first one is my best friend for 15 years now (i am 26). And the second one is the crush. \n\nShe is amazing, genuiely caring the polarity we share on our judging functions (Fe Ti) is great. We have thoughful meaningful conversations. We connect on so many levels. Yet i can't understand if I should escalate. I don't know if I interpret her caring as signs for me to move things a bit. She texts me asking about the little things to make sure I am okay, she genuiely cares and i feel heard and same for her i think. \n\nWhen my feelings are strong i tend to be avoidant, i dont text back immediately. It is like i am afraid to or i overthink it in a way. \n\nAs an INTP i tend to overthink and analyze, and if I don't have a clear sign i withhold. Any advice ?\n\nThank you <3 keep being awesome!
7	Us ENFJs can barley care for the details of our own lives (Si blindspot) so if she’s making that kind of effort with you, I’d say she really cares. It’s worth a shot.
5	I'm an INTP(M) and I've recently fallen hard for an ENFJ(F).  The feelings are reciprocated, but we've been enforcing certain boundaries because of complications in our personal lives.  \n\nThe chemistry is excellent, we have endless commonalities in our attitudes, interests, and values.  We respect what what differences we do have in such a way that it only brings more value to our friendship.  She's incredibly bright and interesting and articulates well through word games that contain metaphor and implication.  I'm obsessed.  We can talk for hours without running out of things to say or tiring.  With time, I fully expect to have a flourishing, communicative, and loving relationship with her.  \n\nI suggest you tell her how you feel.  It isn't hard to tell someone that you think about them often.  Make an excuse to spend time with her.  Show investment by consistently asking how she is or how she's spent her day.  Find out what she enjoys (mine likes nature, walking, hiking, learning, and exploration) and take her out.
3	If you meet an ENFJ girl, you don't wanna miss it. 
2	Go for it, you're awesome !
2	Try not to be as avoidant with her, if you can. Coming from a female ENFJ, I tend to get very hurt if my friends, and especially if my boyfriend, doesn't answer me in a timely fashion or acts distant, and I sometimes begin to question how much they care, and I would certainly feel this way even more so if this was someone I had a crush on and didn't know too well yet, because I would assume that they are not that interested in me. Of course, I am incredibly understanding and I get that sometimes people just have their own stuff going on and can't always answer me, but talking/keeping in touch is very important to me as an ENFJ, as I'm sure it may be to your crush. And if you start reaching out more and being less avoidant than usual, she will probably start to pick up on the fact that you like her before you even get the chance to tell her. Best or luck to you, keep us all posted! :)
1	First: I don't answer for all ENFJs.\n\nIf you like her, you should state your feelings to her; it's better for your mental health and she'll probably appreciate that you took the initiative.\n\nBut also acknowledge that, if things don't work out for both of you, the relationship that you share with each other could be irreparably damaged.\n\nOn another note: I know that we can't choose the people that we cross paths with in our lives. But, if I had a choice, I would choose someone that I'm more compatible with for the long term. You have more chances of success with these four types: ESFP, INTP, ISFJ, and ENTJ.\n\nContradictorily and coincidentally, I'm an ENFJ and my best friend for over 15 years is an INTP.
14	What do you find seductive ?	Hi ENFJ !\n\nINTP female here and deeply in love with an ENFJ friend. Everyone's different but I'm wondering what you, as ENFJ could find seductive about INTPs (and NTs in general). I've never had such strong feelings for someone before and don't know how to show I care. When I met him, he tried to seduce me but I ignored him (because I didn't knew him at the time) and now, it's like he definitely moved on and don't consider me one bit as a potential girlfriend. \n\nHe once told me that he was attracted by people that were different than him. But I feel like I sometime hurt his feeling when mentioning sensitive subjects. We never argue because he stops the conversation (even stop talking sometime). For me, talking about those topics is a way of establishing a connection with him. I may sound like I'm judging him, but really, all I want is to help. For me, it's a way to show I care but he doesn't seem to understand that. 
9	Not sure trying to talk about topics that are sensitive to him is going to be very seductive.  You have to build trust with him before he shares. \nI'm not sure who he is or how you want to seduce him really.  If he is an enfj then he might want to be friends first before committing to anything, so, I guess listen a lot to him.  And then seduction would probably be the same for anyone but small and gentle touches building up?  Like foreplay.  Not sure.  Good luck!
4	an ENFJ that stops the conversation?
2	Maybe the way you bring up sensitive subjects is hurting him. Try really paying attention to what he's saying, look at his body language, if you see that he's not wanting to talk, you can ask him "hey, it feels like you don't wanna talk, I'm sorry if I hurt you, do you not want to talk about these subjects ?" It shows that you're paying attention to him and his feelings (as an enfj, I personally like that). \nHelpfully he'll open up a little more, and you'll gain his trust.\n
26	INFJ dating an ENFJ, please help	So i recently had my first date with an ENFJ, hes an really interesting person i really wanna get to know him better. The problem? He rushes things way too much.\n\nOn our first date he told me how he want to marry me in the upcoming months and basically explained to me a very detailed future of the two of us. Im completely different there, but i like him, i really do. Its so weird how hes so educated and smart and yet shows such an immature behaviour. \n\nIts hard for me to show him that im interested in him but also dont wanna rush things. I tried to laugh it off and though he seemed to understand me im afraid he thinks im not interested. \n\nIs this normal ENFJ behaviour, how would you react to it and what would you advice me to do there? Is this a red flag i should watch out for?
37	Yep. Basically, he's telling you he's not playing around and he's in it for a long term and that he doesn't see the reason for dating anyone if there's no conclusive and definitive outcome, in this case, marriage. Enfjs don't play around and they don't like wasting their time and effort with people. 
14	ENFJ lady here. \n\nJust because this is common, well-intended ENFJ behavior doesn't make it right. No one knows that their date is marriage material after one dinner. \n\nHave I thought this before? Sure. Did I say it? Hell no. \n\nYou're right. This guy is emotionally immature. That doesn't mean you can't date him (or maybe marry him some day, who knows). That doesn't mean he won't mature later. But yes, it's immature behavior now.
6	I'm an Infj and my Enfj boyfriend is like this too. Ive never met such a straightforward person until I met him. At the beginning it caught me by surprise, but that's one of things I like the most about him, he was the who said I love you first and it scared me (in a heart warming way), so I understand you. I don't know about you, but I've never had somebody get me like he does. Anyway, it seems like this guy really likes you and is really sure about his feelings. 
5	I’m an ENFJ female who is engaged to an ENFP male. \n\nSome feel I’m too open with my thoughts. Luckily my fiancé loves my straight forwardness. ENFJ’s don’t beat around the bush. I don’t know the guy but it sounds like your uncomfortable with the openness which is totally okay. It’s not for everyone! I personally don’t think he is being “immature” per say, however, I could be wrong. I actually let my fiancé know about a couple weeks into meeting him that I knew we would be married someday (before we were even dating). He was on the same page. \n\nIt could be that he is being super open to show you “hey I’m serious about this. If you are not, let me know ASAP. ” Do you know anything about his past? Maybe an ex was never fully committed so he is looking for that now and doesn’t want to get too far into something without knowing for sure you will be by his side for the long run? The reason I brought it all up was due to the fact I had been in some relationships that were not right for me. I knew what I wanted and needed and got that off my chest very early on to show I’m not just looking to have fun. I was looking for my life partner. Be open and honest with him! It’s very important you’re on the same page :) 
5	This comes across as someone who seems to be in love with the concept of a relationship over the person in it with them. You can be Sigmund Freud and there's still no way one can ascertain whether an another person is right for you. If you like this person keep them along until you yourself feel comfortable and if they say that's too long you have to stand your ground. Don't risk long term happiness for something short term
2	Prob. With all my relationships I always heavily thought about the long term
2	Haaaavvveee you met Ted?
2	i “proposed” to my INFJ wife before we started dating, after like 15 minutes of making out. in my defense we’d been friends for over a year, and i was already crazy about her. somehow she decided i wasn’t completely insane, or at least that i was worth it, and we’ve been together ever since. 
2	Bit surprised at the amount of people claiming that a marriage proposal within the first date is /regular/ behaviour for an ENFJ. Or *any* mature personality type in fact. (Unless you knew each other beforehand)\n\nI’m also against these sweeping monolith statements that are made about personality types on forums. I, for one, take ages to reveal my full self to a significant other. So much so, that I’m 21 (nearly 22) and never been in a relationship. A large part of that is because I’m a gay guy that tends to run away from potential suitors. \n\nRegardless, he does sound sweet and I hope it goes well. 
1	I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n- [/r/infj] [Advice from my fellow INFJ friends is appreciated](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/a2h3op/advice_from_my_fellow_infj_friends_is_appreciated/)\n\n&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
1	We do that. Its not like he's telling you that is how the future is going to be like, we just enjoy thinking about stuff like this. He just has to remember other people don't think about the future in such detail as we do. My girlfriend is an INFP and she isn't like this at all. I had to hols back a lot in order to not freak her out. Later in our relationship I started telling her these things and she understands its just fun for me to thini about these things, so its not that scary now. 
1	INFJ here dating an ENFJ for 2 yrs now... he is the most straightforward person I know. From the beginning he made it very clear he was interested, didn't play any games and told me his intentions with me. He is very emotionally intelligent, as ENFJs generally are, therefore he will be able to read you if you're not serious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy advice would be to be straightforward - the way he courageously told you his thoughts and feelings about the two of you, you should courageously tell him your thoughts and feelings about the two of you.

4	Do you fellow ENFJs also dislike the disingenous lol's, k's, and lmao's?	I've been realizing that I share a lot of common with you folks.\n\nDon't you guys hate it when people respond with "lol, k, lmao" in response to something you say. It's like they have nothing to contribute to the conversation so instead go with those abbreviations which come off in a condescending and fake manner. NO, YOU'RE NOT "HIP" OR "COOL". \n\nIt's just a pet peeve of mine, but nowadays since it's so prevalent I just have to accept it. AM I ALONE IN THIS?
3	Yep, Yes, Yea, ya, yeah...AS an ENFJ I am quite the conversationalist. I crave it. I long for the exchange. But to message something from your heart and get k....OMG I feel so disrespected and unappreciated. 
2	Depends on the situation. I'll do a "lol" or "hm" myself to let people know I read what they wrote but don't have anything to add right now. Could be a topic that doesn't necessarily require further discussion as well. That's the way I see it when my friends write something like that as well and luckily we understand eachother. I mean, you won't get a full intense discussion out of every random thing.\n\nIf in the other hand it's something more important... Well, it depends again. I could go with a "hm" again for the same reasons as above, but I'd probably come up with a proper reply a couple minutes later. Or follow up with "I don't know what to say" if I really can't figure something out. And same goes in return. \n\nLuckily I never get the full blown "lol k lmao" but if I did, then that's probably not from someone I consider close enough to bother.\n\nSo I guess it all comes down to reading the situation and people correctly. If you have someone that consistently does this kind of uninterested replies, perhaps they're someone you shouldn't invest too much energy in, since they don't seem to value you highly anyway. 
3	LOOKS TO BE THE CASE
1	My little brothers been doing this to me it bothers me so much. speak damn you
1	yessss lol, even one actual comment and not just lol, k, lmao would contribute to the conversation... c'mon
1	Omg yes I relate to this so much! Texting adds such disconnect in my relationships, to be honest. Which is why I encourage the people closest to me to call me on the phone or video chat with me to catch up instead of texting. Of course, I still mainly text people to keep in touch because people don't always have the time to drop what they're doing to talk on the phone or videochat but I try to get on the phone with or videochat with the people I'm closest to at least once a week or once every two weeks to catch up, but more is always welcome :D
1	It bothers me. But I am also bothered by general disingenuous things.
16	Hello fellow ENFJs.	How do you balance being nice with others with having boundaries? I feel like so few people respect me because I’m too nice, and not many people like me because I can be intense and passionate as well (now I’m not saying that I’m devoid of any flaws, but sometimes the reception I receive is unwarranted). And, while I am aware that for others to respect me, I have to first respect myself, I’m unaware of how to do that.
8	Realize that for you to respect/care/help others, you have to first care/think about yourself. I’m going through the exact same thing right now, and I find this helps me quite a bit. 
6	Make rules where you're the person who comes first.  Say no to people for a while so that you get used to knowing that you're able to.  Stuff like that.
4	A big lesson for us is saying no and not feeling bad about it. Boy, it might take me a lifetime to learn this! 
4	An exercise I've been doing is trying to say "no" unapologetically, and without justifications. People abuse of us ENFJ too much because they know we care and we can easily put ourselves as a non priority. Sometimes we just have to say no, not to be assholes or mean, just to protect ourselves too. \nGood luck !
5	This comes out for me a lot at work. I’m an ENFJ through and through, and I work will vulnerable individuals and professional boundaries are something I’m still trying to master when at the end of sessions clients go for hugs and I’ve got to hit them will the awkward handshake. Even when it feel unnatural to me personally. \n\nIt really comes down to learning to be a little bit more stern when necessary. Stern isn’t even the correct work, more like intensional. Because I get the feeling that you’re talking about the workplace, or an environment like that, and “nice” sometimes reads as unprofessional or weak or what have you. I’d say that learning to be more intentional with what needs to be done/said, because often times when I think about my best actions, a more simple and concise solution can be reached without be dumping a whole lot of unnecessary “feeling” into it. \n\nKeep on keeping on! 
4	One of the hardest things for an ENFJ to do is to address their own needs. Boundaries, honestly come from seeing yourself as you actually are, not only accepting the faults you have but also believing in the gifts your personality brings with it. We ENFJs are WAY TO HARD on ourselves but in truth, we have many great qualities. Boundaries come when you find your own worth whether that be ENFJ or any other personality type. Remember, no one is gonna take care of you but you. 
12	Career paths for an ENFJ?	Hey guys,\nI am 20 years old and have thought about which path I want to take as far as a career for awhile now. Obviously, I love to talk with people and help where I can. What are some interesting careers that are well suited for ENFJs? 
9	Even organizer, marketing, sales representative, nurse, ❤️
8	I know it's oversaid, but anything. \n\nENJFs are people persons for the most part. No matter what career you are in, you can be with people. \n\nI do engineering and military service, personally. I've also worked with crisis lines. It's radically different then what most people here would see an ENFJ do. My ENFJ girlfriend is in college recruiting. \n\nFind a need you want to fill and fill it. ENFJs want to help people. People need help everywhere. 
4	I was in medicine for over 2 years because I enjoyed helping people and socializing with patients but the discipline itself was not suited to my mind. I wanted something that would match my strengths in understanding people, being fast paced, energetic, and most of all, would make me happy. \n\nAfter a lot of classes, exams, and stress, I made the biggest decision in my life to change my line to studying business. Now I’m a business administration major with a concentration in marketing and I love it. In the long term, I want to be either a hospital administrator, HR manager, advertising executive, or non-profit director. We’ll see where the road goes :)
4	Im currently going through a psych degree with plans to go into councelling or therapy. I just get a kick out of helping people as best I can so it seemed like a logical career choice for me
3	I studied education and teach high school Philosophy.\n\nPro: Working with young people, helping them to open their horizons plus being in contact with teachers from other subjects... it makes for an engaging and energizing workplace. It also allows me to keep studying and investigating myself.\n\nCon: lesson planning and grading to a certain degree make me very anxious, because I want my classes to be perfect, I want to be just and I want to see my students triumph... but it isn't always the case. There's always going to be someone that would be left behind despite all your efforts.
3	Advertising or PR 
3	I’m in HR and I think it really balances with the part of me that likes looking after people. I love engagement and figuring out how to make people happier in their role whilst also being involved in more administrative type stuff such as reporting and anything that involves organising. I’ve been in HR for about four and a half years now & really enjoy it ☺️
3	I am 21 and currently pursuing the path of entrepreneurship, and boy is it hard.\n\nIf you excel at problem-solving and analyzing, I would recommend this for you however this is under the situation where I don't have any other talents. *Kind of sucks, eh?*\n\nPlus, I always want to pursue my humanitarian ideals, like becoming a sociologist, or some kind of traveler that takes time visiting places all over the world and observes them, records them. And I find that quite common between ENFJs since our aptitude is humanitarian direction, sociologist, anthropologist, a man of culture, *know what I'm saying?*\n\nIf you enjoying mentoring, teaching and inspiring, you can pursue an educator career. An educator, listen, not a teacher. Best utilize our skills to inspire people instead of rigidly imprinting texts into students' brains.\n\nAnd frankly, I'd also suggest you to go out there and experience the world. That said, go do different types of jobs, and find out your very own appetite. Our advices are quite general. I am saying this because I was once at your position before so I would love to point out how you can walk this path correctly by discovering yourself. I've seen people generally just not going to college, instead they go do all sorts of work in society. And later they find out what they like and what they dislike, then you'll see a clearer picture of your future career. Then, you can get back to college, or straight up starting to pursue a better career.\n\nHope this helps!
2	Speech therapist 
2	I’ve been working security this last year and love it. I can read people so well on camera it’s fun. Plus I have to talk all day to the sales team and have them contact customers it’s the first fun job I have had. I’m interested in doing something with public speaking or schools in the long run though
2	Teacher, Nurse, Actor, Politician are a few
2	I'm a teaching assistant for undergrad science labs and I LOVE teaching! It lets me take something I'm passionate about and share it with others, working with them one-on-one and in a group setting.
2	I'm currently in law school and planning to get my MLS as well to be a law librarian, bc I want a career that let's me help people with a work life balance, and you have plenty of other career options with a JD to help all kinds of people in all kinds of ways
2	Finished my Business/IT degree and working as an IT Recruiter right now :)
2	Water management. You can go in many directions and it is never the same
1	Thank you all for you comments! It's really eye opening and helpful!!
8	INTP friend (Online) went inactive on all of his accounts 5 months ago. Any way I can reach him?	So a good INTP friend of mine disassociated  his Discord and his Reddit account 5 months ago. For a while I called him once a day to make sure he was alright, but he never picked up. Now I’m worried. I had forgot about him for a while, but I realized how much I missed him. On his Reddit account, he said something about “making a new account in the interest of not tying it to my personal life” which is completely understandable.\n\nI miss him. I don’t know, maybe he just realized that he didn’t want to talk to me anymore or be my friend? I don’t care if he thinks that. I just want to know if he’s alright. I miss him.
7	[deleted]
4	Now I haven't done this and I only kind of understand it but my ENFJ gf has alao had this happen to her. \n\nShe found a guy and became friends with him. He disappeared for several months. Then he came back. In those months she worried a lot but she managed to get over it. This also her advice to you. \n\nMaybe her experience is different since the guy in her instance lied a lot so it was more obvious that she had to distance herself from him. \n\nDon't expect him to come back. Move on and if he does come back then see if you are interested in being friends with him but try not to think about it now since there is nothing you can do. 
19	I can be myself without paranoia of superficial society treating me differently!	For the last couple of years, I've been in an spiral of paranoia and depression. I put my bubbly, silly personality on the table wherever I went, but when I got treated like a child or rejected, it just took away all my energy.\n\nDating wise, being a guy, it seemed like almost all the girls in the world wanted a masculine, non-needy, suave and confident guy. I tried my best to emulate that, but it conflicted with my natural personality of taking things lightheartedly and wearing my heart/feelings on my sleeve.\n\nAdditionally, I became extremely paranoid of how superficial society was. When I was happy and relatively successful, I thought I had friends who liked me. But after getting into a bad place financially, my "friends" saw me living destitutely and just ignored me. This just broke me. I was always the type to not be able to ignore a sad looking person. For example, when I saw a homeless guy wandering campus, I asked him if he needed anything, got him a sandwich, and tried to talk with him heart to heart and guide him to a better place.\n\nCue the next two years of me trying to struggle through life. I wanted to share my life with someone, to make myself look good, be successful, but I was paralyzed by the idea that people would like me only when I was "successful". I thought the solution was to find a soulmate, so I know they would like me for me and that they believed in me when I was a nobody. That didn't work out either (finding the one is luck based and requires time).\n\nThen just recently, I began to embrace my true self. I'm not a macho person. I'm sweet, cute, child-like, lighthearted, and adorable, and there's nothing wrong with that. That doesn't mean I'm effeminate, because I still am protective and caring and that's all I think a man needs to be. I know now to not worry about those who aren't my type, but to only focus about those who are compatible with me (sweet, genuine, lighthearted people).\n\nI'm still out on the lookout for my soulmate, and I know when I do, I'll be able to reach my full potential. But until then, at least I am now able to function without constantly being paralyzed by paranoia of superficial people and trying to figure out solutions/systems to motivate myself in such a society.\n\n&#x200B;
3	There's nothing wrong with being a sweet sensitive guy, if people cant accept you for that, or just for being who you are, then you're better off without them. Sure, no one's perfect, there will always be things about ourselves that we'll need to work on, but you're not hurting anyone by being "you", on the contrary !\n (Being a "man" =/= being a douchbag, I know, what a shock, lol) \nGood luck finding your soulmate, dont forget to never settle, you deserve someone that will love you at 100%. 
3	I'm glad you're embracing yourself! If you truly want a soulmate, you have to be yourself to find her. \n\nI'm an INFP and my husband is an ENFJ. At first I was scared of him because he's very tall and intimidating and I thought he would be an 'objectifying women' type of guy. Then I got to know him and he's so kind and sweet and cries during chick flicks. He's the one that helps me express my emotions because I can be closed off sometimes.  There is a woman out there who will absolutely love you! I suggest looking for an introvert and if you find one you like, be upfront with her. I used to shy away from extroverts because I thought they just talked to everybody and weren't interested in me.  My husband told me pretty early on that he liked me and it made it way easier to flirt with him because the pressure was off. \n\nGood luck!
2	I (INFJ/F) know this is a cliché, but please just be yourself and the right person will accept you. My husband is an ENFJ and I wouldn't change him for the world. He's masculine when it's necessary and he's free to be emotional. Men have emotions and personality, they are people! 
2	I think we all struggle more or less with this, until we find people that accept us just as we are (and it didn't happen to me until I got to college). I think I had the advantage that, given my social standing and how "weird" my family is, I was never ever going to be popular or sought out by fake people.\n\nDon't be afraid and don't give up. Don't waste your gifts on those who won't appreciate them. Keep it up!
2	Buddy this whole cool asshole image for guys came because women tend to relate that sort of attitude to confidence and temperament but most women fail to realize that these guys often don't give a shit because they don't understand how to give a shit in the first place. \nIt is the man, that understands these notions of being loving , caring and protective and yet is able to keep this all under because he knows he doesn't have to prove it to anyone, that's what women really want and I don't want to sound like a sexist , women like being chased , it is their nature. \nYour attention toward them is your greatest asset , use it wisely. \nPeople might just misconstrue me as being shallow or whatever for saying this, but do I give a fuck ? \nNo, not really. That is the moral of this story lol
1	Sounds like ENFP to me but I may make a mistake ;p
1	woot up i love this post because it’s basically [this song ](https://youtu.be/Ma7lyfYzIw8) called *true love will find you in the end* ....maybe kinda. a really nice song a really nice post. I just came back from a small party, a tiring one where everyone was pretending to be someone else and seeing them like that made me feel kinda alone. BUT then i find this post. lotsa love 
1	What you said about the superficial society are most likely true. But it’s not necessarily a bad thing. Plus it’s always good to see things more clearly as what they are. \nThe hegemonic masculinity values aggressiveness, decisiveness, and confidence, and subjugate the opposite. This is especially worse if you are a member of racial or sexual minority. But hang in there buddy, have faith in yourself, and keep it all positive!
4	Weary Traveler Looking for Answers	Hey so I'm an INTP looking for answers. After a quick and very limited google search it said this was one of the more if not the most emotional type. With that I was wondering what it is like to make decisions using emotions and not logic and reason. I would like to understand this so I can start to understand other types in more depth. On the INTP subreddit there have been post on how to think like a feeler by asking questions like "How would this make me feel?" and questions of that similar nature. Is this true or is there more involved with decision making than just how would I and others feel about x, y, or z? Also do you consider other peoples feelings when making these decisions? In this post I am referring to nothing was said about this, but it was also written by an INTP who had tried it.  I'm also happy to answer other questions about INTPs if you feel so inclined. 
9	I want to start off by saying that my decisions aren’t made without logic or reason, as you put it. What I’m typically looking at is “What will be the best outcome for the group?” with the outcome being what is going to make everyone the happiest in any given situation. Sometimes a specific situation might call for an unfavorable immediate outcome, but lead to more positive results later on. I almost never consider “How will this make me feel?” Though, I do consider “How will this make others feel?”\n\n\nSimply put, my decision making process is to determine the best outcome for the group.\n\n\nIt might be easier to give you an answer if you were to provide an example situation or decision.
4	ENFJ 25yo male.\n\nThe interesting thing here is that INTPs and ENFJs share the Ti/Fe (Introverted thinking/Extraverted Feeling) cognitive axis, where Ti is driving and Fe is inferior for INTPs and the other way around for ENFJs. I see the axis relationship as the driving being our main M.O. and the inferior being a supportive silent guide. As an ENFJ I usually take other peoples openions and perspectives into consideration before figuring out what the logical thing to do is. It is essential for an ENFJ to be informed before making a decision that is best for everyone. It is therefore not uncommon to 'crack a few eggs' for the sake of the greater good, because it's nearly impossible to make everybody happy with and still do what is 'best' as whole. So I don't think that your notion of ENFJs making decisions without logic is correct at all. That being said, when ENFJs are under stress, Ti is usually the first thing out the window, which leads to this nasty 'people pleasing' syndorme, where the ENFJ will where themselves thin in an attempt to meet everybody's needs. Ti is for the ENFJ the inferior function and is by definition the weakest and we have a sort of love/hate relationship with it. ENFJ's love to make informed decisions, but we are constantly worried that we are wrong, which can lead to the reluctances or unwillingness to state facts and knowlagde with confidence. Personally when I was younger, I would default to state facts with "I Think, but I might be wrong..." or "I am not sure, but i believe..." just to protect myself, in case I was wrong. Today being wrong is more for me like a learning experience, it still doesn't feel great to be wrong when im very confident that i am right, but I have learned to embrace it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe whole "What would this make me feel?" is a great exercise for ENFJs as well as INTPs. ENFJs often forgets that 'The group' includes themselves as well. Even though we are extraverted in nature, we benefit a lot from alone time and quiet self reflections since our own feelings are often a background noise we often don't tune into for support. \n\nIf you want to know more about the internal feeling values system, try the INFPs or ISFPs as their driving function id Fi (Introverted feeling)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am really curious as to how INTP react under stress. I have done some research for this comment, where I read that when INTPs feel stress they would default to an emotionless wall of logic to cope with the outside world. How do you experience your Ti/Fe? Do you ever consider the group or is it just cold hard logic all the way? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheers!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: Not a native english speaker, so grammar might not be good and sentences might be weird.\n\nSome sources:\n\n[https://www.idrlabs.com/articles/2016/09/illustrating-function-axes-part-2-feti/](https://www.idrlabs.com/articles/2016/09/illustrating-function-axes-part-2-feti/)\n\n[https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/if-youre-confused-about-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-read-this-an-intro-to-cognitive-functions/](https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/if-youre-confused-about-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-read-this-an-intro-to-cognitive-functions/)\n\n[https://personalityjunkie.com/04/ti-fe-fi-te-function-pairs-type-biases/](https://personalityjunkie.com/04/ti-fe-fi-te-function-pairs-type-biases/)
2	If it is a decision about myself or my life, I am always trying to discern the best possible outcomes, and I am always taking into account how other would react to that decision, not necessarily to modify it, but to prepare myself to confront those reactions.\n\nWhen it comes to group decisions, using your example, I would try to propose C and at the same time keep what's good from ideas A and B (Or at least, mention the good part but politely point out the flaws. Eg: "I really like what you say re x. What I cannot see clearly is how problem y can be solved through x"). I usually work under the premise that everyone wants to be heard and that things run smoother when everyone agrees or gets something out of the deal.\n\nIn the end, it isn't that one is always deciding based on feelings, but that one is always considering the feelings of others as an important factor. ENFJs in particular use Ni a lot for taking decisions, comparing patterns experienced in the past to present situations or trying to find correlations between things.
2	First of all, understand that when an ENFJ walks into a room we feel the room. We do this without trying it is just a natural thing we do. It is truly like a feelings/emotional radar. What we pick up on our feelings radar we automatically reflect. We are not choosing this. This is just the way our brains function. We pick up on the tiniest subtlety of emotion. We can and do read people. Because we are not choosing to be emotional, we just are, we are always feeling. We will talk about anything. If we trust you, we will share our feelings about things. But we don't actively choose to be emotional. It is just our natural state of being. As long as you don't come across as condescending and demeaning we will engage you in conversation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my personal experience, I can tell you that I feel, I act, then I think. This is not true of a more logical person. They think, act, then feel. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe always consider feelings of others because we are driven by an inner sense of harmony. We want harmony and balance in everything. We want people to be happy and content. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnderstand that because we are emotional creatures and desire harmony above all else we become chameleons. We will imitate the mood, the feeling of the room, or the intensity of the conversation. Again, we do not actively choose to do this, it is just how our brains function. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope that helps. 
6	ENTJ (F) and ENFJ (M) Relationship Advice	I’ve recently entered into a relationship with an ENFJ. So far, its been a great experience. I was wondering about any potential problems that could arise due to our type difference.  
13	In general, NTs are notoriously more insensitive than NFs. Not that it’s intentional or malicious or anything like that on the NT’s part. It’s just not a part of your processing make up to consider the human element as much. Just acknowledge that y’all have ways of taking in the world that are different but both ultimately valid. If you can look at those differences as mutually beneficial balancing points that are worthy of respect rather than prizing one as better than the other, you should be fine. Source: Am an ENFJ, have been in relationships primarily with NTs. 
5	Just be more sensitive to feelings and understand that your partner feels things deeply. Be honest amd authentic as well! :D
4	I’m an ENFJ (27 F) dating and living  with an ENTJ (27 M) and we  are both firey personalities but it weirdly works really well. When we argue it’s over dumb shit and we just end up laughing, and it just makes the sex better. We have no major problems, everything is always out in the open before it becomes a problem. Nothing is ever swept under he rug and he keeps me grounded and I help him access his emotional side more. The rest is like a power couple dynamic: very hot.
6	Don’t cheat. Be open and honest. Be each other’s only. Have fun and make things fun. 
3	M ENFJ married for 8 years to F ENTJ. Feel free to ask any questions
1	Are you familiar with cognitive functions and also type dynamics? I’m no expert but those tools helped me deeper than just the mbti types alone. 
7	I tested as ENFJ, but I’m too mean	So, I have taken lots and lots of tests and none of them felt right until initially I got ENFJ, and when I looked at the functions I was like that’s right on. However, reading more and more on the type it’s portrayed as so...nice? And I feel I am not that. \n  Before I go on, let me say that my test gave slightly vague results. For instance I only scored 1% extroversion over introversion. And only 6% feeling over thinking. Previously I had tested as ENTP or ENTJ. \n  So here’s my problem. \nI’m really cynical. I’m very blunt. I’ll state my opinion readily in a conversation even though it’s unpopular. I don’t shrink away from conflict, I don’t like real arguing though—fake arguing is fun for a while but I get tired of it. \n  I’m very dry, and sarcastic. Most of the time it’s mistaken as being mean or brutally honest. \nI don’t readily talk about my feelings, or my emotions. Honestly, my feelings confuse me and I squash them down a lot rather than deal with them. \n  Here’s the root of my conflict. I am an emotional person. I’m a feeling person. I feel things very intensely and very deeply, but I don’t understand them nor do I take pride in or enjoy “feeling”. I’d rather not have as many feelings, honestly. \n  So this is why I don’t think I’m ENTP, or ENTJ, but with ENFJ, I just feel I’m so not—bubbly and “the mother of the group,” I feel like I present ENTP on the outside but on the inside I’m more ENFJ....(just not as nice) does that make any sense? \n  What do y’all think? Is my type accurate? Am I overthinking this? Are there any other sarcastic, blunt, straight forward ENFJs out there? 
5	[deleted]
5	I am going to be crucified for saying this, but I think there are ENFJs that lean towards the ESFJ side and ENFJs that lean towards the ENTJ side.\n\nI am blunt too, and prefer blunt people (with time I've come to realize that trying to tune with people that fake emotions is very energy consuming). I can be cutting when I want to, but that's precisely because I know what words and thing use to hurt others when I am angry.\n\nI am hardly aware of my own feelings, until someone points them out to me. Like, one day I may perceive that I am being more aggressive than usual and don't know why, until someone asks me about it. I think that has a lot to do with our feeling function being outward oriented.\n\nI think most stereotypical descriptions of ENFJs either present us as perfect goody two shoes or magnificent bastards and it doesn't help.\n\nAs a side note, I wouldn't say that a salient thing for ENTPs is not having lots of feelings. The thing that strikes me most about them is that they usually are unpredictable and do a lot of divergent thinking (strong Ne).
5	Look into cognitive functions. Tests can be inaccurate because you can answer what you think is right instead of what you actually do. Mbti is more along the lines of how you process things, and a little bit of how you behave. Behavior is mostly influenced by your experiences and environment
5	Tests aren't very accurate. Head to r/mbti and read the sidebar. They get into the functions for each type. 
4	Sounds like you’re using a lot of your inferior Ti function. Also if you look into DaveSuperPowers objective typology they have in their system masculine and feminine energies to the cognitive functions. Like masculine Fe can be pushy and blunt. 
4	Hello. I am an ENFJ and I have a very close friend who is also an ENFJ. But both of us are very different. I am the bubbly softy kind of ENFJ and she is the sarcastic blunt kind of ENFJ. People would not assume that we are of the same type and people, even I, tend to think she is ENTJ. I am also too naive and she is cynical. Although for me, she only presents as ENTJ on the outside. When I got to know her on a deeper level, she really is a soft person who is interested in people and helping people grow. But one would not know this if one is not close to her on a very deep level. She has experienced so much cruelty in the world especially in her childhood, that is why I think she is cynical. But deep inside, I can see that she still thinks humanity can improve. We also have the same hobby of analyzing humans and their personalities and understanding them better. We also agree with wanting to do relevant things for the world. We love having very deep conversations, especially questions that get to know a person on a deeper level like their greatest fears, greatest regret, happiest memory, etc. I never thought someone else would share this with me, but two ENFJs I know are into this as well. I am the mother type and she is not. But she helps people grow in a different level, like listening to them and being there, but not the smothering type like me. We are all different with all our complexities. There is no same type that are exaclty alike. There are similarities, but a lot of things can still be factors. We are too complex. :D
2	What does being "mean" have to do with MBTI? Also, the fact that you think ANY description of an ENFJ sounds "nice" is a good indication you at least value Fe and Ti.
1	I think that it is normal to feel like other types since we are a far more complex system than 16 personalities there is 3 layers to our personality too : biogenic (genes/DNA) sociogenic (environment and social circle) ideogenic (ideas and projects that you decide to be important. \n\nWhile MBTI is a good tool to recognize strengths and point to weaknesses. The big 5 personality can help you see more. One of the traits explored by the big 5 (a.k.a OCEAN) is Agreeableness on which you might score low thus feeling "mean". An ENTP wouldn't care that much of being perceived as mean since the truth (subjective) might interest them more. \n\nBig five is pretty well researched in the scientific literature and will help you see others sides of your personality. \n\nMuch love ENFJs you are awesome always looking to help the world feel good <3 we need you\n\nEdit : Agreeableness can be developed and worked on just like any other skill. Deliberate practice and self awareness. You are Fe user it will be even easier for you than me for example as I have a baby Fe 
1	To be frank.\nENFJs are overtly portrayed to as angels from heaven or the manipulators with power levels only the offspring of lucifer could possess. \nIt’s very strange. And I don’t agree with it.\n\nIt’s more about how you use your cognitive functions to process, understand and venture the world. 
5	Need advice	hey! im pretty sure im an enfj, im 15 (Aries) and suffer with ADD and OCD. my mind is constantly active and filled with complex ideas. been chatting/having deep conversations with an entp aquarius, due to issues involving age they have been put on hold until im older. anyway im blabbing.. i just feel like my conversations are 100x better and more interesting with people older than me. i just really want a good convo? is there any places to go/ people who will chat with me? help!!
1	If you're looking for social media kinda places I guess amino is good. They probably have a MBTI amino. They DEFINITELY have an astrology amino though.\nAlso I'm around your age you can also talk to me lmao
16	Turns out I'm ENFJ and Not ENFP	I just took the test on 16personalities for the first time in well over a year. I always tested ENFP, but I've done a lot of growing in the past year and feel more true to myself than ever. This, I can only assume, reflected in my results and is why I now am an ENFJ. Has anyone else gone through something similar? 
15	well you need to go beyond tests and go for cognative functions, check out [here](http://www.cognitiveprocesses.com/16Types/ENFJ.cfm) to see if this fits you, or if ENFJ does.\n\nPeople don't really change their core personalities much unless they been through something traumatic.  Then again you could have been ENFJ all along and just answered things based on what you felt was write instead of what you actually do
4	Yes I just had the exact same change happen to me, was an ENFP then took cognitive functions test and said mine were the ENFJ functions. I overwhelmingly agreed with the cognitive function assessment and now am almost 90% sure I'm an ENFJ. 
3	Do you accommodate everyone you meet? Are you super deep when it comes to religion and philosophy, do you believe in the innate potential of everyone you meet? Does criticism cause a negative internal reaction? If so your probably enfj.
3	Yeah 16 personalities is very inaccurate. Most of the ENFJs I know of have said that they typed as ENFP on that system. If you read on their website they don’t even test MBTI they use the big 5 and package it like MBTI. Defiantly read about the cognitive functions, that’s helped me a lot! :) 
2	Yup —went through a lot of personal growth and went from INFP —> ENFP —> ENFJ in the past year 
2	Omg opposite. I was always ENFJ but I took the test last week I'm an ENFP!? \n\nwho knows man. we still growing ^^
2	I tested as an ENTP for since I know the test (2 years), I think I finally know why it felt a little weird to me. Im not ENTP. Im a surpressed ENFJ having felt due to my FeNi I had to change due to my extremely rational family and friends. Lol this is so weird
2	exact same thing happened for me. i was ENFP all through high school and ever since sophomore year of college, i've been ENFJ! guess it took a lot of new experiences to shape me into who i really am
1	I'm glad i'm not the only one!\ni used to get ENFP constantly, after taking the test again since june i got ENFJ!
3	Are there any ENFJs living in Shanghai, China?	Tell me your stories! How is it there? Do you like it there?
11	Nope. ENFJs arent allowed in China. 
1	fellow Enfj here! glad i could chime in on such a specific question haha.\n\ni lived in shanghai for 6 months and absolutely loved it . i really enjoyed making friends with other ex-pats and learning about their backgrounds as well as relying on eachother as a community for helpful resources, how to get around, etc. there is so much to do in shanghai and many unique neighbourhoods so we had a great time going out quite often, from markets, to trendy or local restaurants, sexy clubs, yongkang lu bar street, karaoke til sunrise, the beautiful architecture in the Bund, the charm of the french concession, i could go on..... \n\ni loved learning the local customs, experiencing the culture of old meets new and the language as well. although manners can be brushed aside at times due to it being a larger and very busy city, i got used to it and learned to go with the flow .  otherwise, i will never forget the kindness and quirkiness of shanghai people and how it was one of the most memorable experiences of my life!\n\nhope you enjoy your time there :) 
1	oh and this website was very helpful !\n\nhttp://www.smartshanghai.com
1	Differences between ENFJ and ENTJ?	Let the games begin. Tell me your stories. Very hard for me to see any differences.
11	ENFJs are diplomatic by nature and are capable of being pragmatic when needed. \n\nENTJs are pragmatic by nature and capable of being diplomatic when needed
6	Feelers empathize, thinkers logic. It's pretty evident. Entjs would focus on rationality and enfjs would focus on feelings
3	Entjs are more concise to the point. Whereas Enfj will use more feely words 
3	You cant tell an enfj what to think, you cant tell an entj who they are.
1	I've become close with an ENTJ over the last year and we LOVE getting into our Ni and talking about big picture societal trends (ie the cultural revolution of the 60's and how it has affected us today, philosophy etc.)   It's like I'm completely on the same page as him. \n\nHe's much more concerned with status and I'm not, that's been about the biggest difference.  
26	Is it even possible for ENFJs to have that one person they call their "best friend"?	Hi everyone, sorry to be a downer but I'm just feeling really sad and lonely and I don't feel like I have anywhere else to turn to and just need somewhere to vent and get support. I'm 21F and just wish I had that ONE girl friend who just gets me and "clicks" with me and who doesn't annoy me and wants to keep in touch and wants to spend time with me just as much as I want to spend time with them. I find that almost all my friends either annoy me/are too immature for my liking, or make minimal effort to keep in touch with me. Alot of my friends also come to me for help with things, and although I know they are there for me, they don't provide me with the same type of, and extent of, support that I provide them with, so I am left just feeling even further misunderstood and alone whenever I go to my friends for help with something. I'm just feeling very disappointed in my friendships lately and I feel like I have no one and no time left to "find my person" since I am about to graduate college . I've always struggled to befriend girls due to their petty/caddiness and infactuation with unimportant things, such as gossiping and going out to bars and clubs and getting hammered, all of which I am not a fan of. I'm the kind of friend that wants to travel and go on adventures and road trips together and have sleepovers and go hiking and spend hours having heart to hearts together. I just want one genuinely kind, caring, generous, thoughtful, down to earth friend who tags me in memes, thinks of me, invites me over for dinner with their family, and considers me their one and only best friend, I don'tunderstand what I'm doing wrong, how is it possible I haven't found this kind of friendship? It's really unfair and very issolating. I've only had this type of friendship twice in my life, but it was many years ago and in one of the friendships, I didn't feel totally connected as a friend to the other person, and the other friendship was toxic. Is it bad that I often wish I could have that toxic friendship back though, even though I know it's bad for me and that the other person doesn't give a shit about me? The only person who I 100% enjoy spending my time with and talking to is my boyfriend, but I would like a friendship that I feel the same way about. I feel like people don't find me fun or interesting,  I just want to be liked and understood. I give my all in my friendships and am kind to all, so it is rather upsetting and frustrating to not have found "my person"- is this really so much to ask for? Will I ever find a best friend? I feel so broken and defeated...
9	Has little to nothing to do with this mbti stuff and all to do with the upbringing, areas, hobbies, people, etc. I was lucky and have been friends with my core group (3 other people) since early elementary school. All best friends but one is my absolute best. We are the realest with one another and get each other. \n\nI’m an enfj when I’m out, but when with friends I am any and everything depending on the situation, who wants to be the social one that day, funny one, serious one, etc. \n\nFriendships, romances (I see an endless slog of romance posts on here) etc. rarely come down to this enfj or whatever people are stuff. Humans are way more complex than this. \n\nGood luck finding what you want in life, pal! 👍🏻
13	Find an INTJ - if you can.\n\nI'm an INTJ and my best friend of the past 12 years is ENFJ. He'd say the same of me.\n\nI think ENFJ's are amazing. Don't get down on yourself. Important relationships sometimes just take a lot of time to find.
5	Hey, you’re only 21. When I was that age I had the same thoughts, but then life came and had me meet people I never even thought existed. Since then I’ve collected my tribe of best friends, and they’re amazing. \n\nFriendship also means getting to know who you are and what you need as a friend, and once you get some of it figured out, it will be easier for you to form relationships with people where you can both meet each other’s needs. 
4	I don't have advice to give but just wanted to say that you are not alone. This is how I feel exactly and have had the same things happen to me. I do have close friends but I'm not 100% open with them. So you're not alone. 
2	heya isfj here and yes i feel you. Nowadays it's just hard to find real friend who will return the same thing and this world is not just fair\n\ndont worry u will soon meet ur real bestfriend :). 
2	I had this problem all throughout high school and some of college. I think when you fit so easily with every group, it’s hard to make really meaningful friendships. It’s hard to be popular but not really feel loved in that special way that others seem to get so easily. 
2	woah...i read this as if i wrote it. i feel 10000% the same exact way. i'm also your age! this is something that is constantly on my mind, pretty much every single day - every single thing you just wrote. let's be friends fr
10	Music liked by r/ENFJ	I strongly believe that to understand how each type views the world, you look at the art they make and swear by.\n\nYou can think of r/MBTIRadioStation as a place to broadcast, type and discuss music, podcasts, videos or whatever you are watching. The goal is to create a directory but you can discuss anything Art, Science, Psychology there.\n\nI think musicians and artists explore a lot of their psyche and shadow through their art. Art is the greatest healer!\n\nBreak all stereotypes!\n\nTo understand the music r/ENFJ likes and loves, I searched for "music" on the searchbar and pulled out some of the songs you peeps have posted here. I did it for other types as well. I found very few youtube links posted here though. Please post your youtube playlists below if you can :)\n\nI have another dataset with just the band names but that will have to wait a bit. Will try to create an excel and share the data once I have done it for all the types.\n\n[Please subscribe to our sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/MBTIRadioStation/) to discover more stuff and post your favourites :) There is also our [sister sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnneagramMusic/) if you are into Enneagram.\n\n* ["Two" | Sleeping At Last](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST4Jq80MWFw)\n* [Bad Suns - Transpose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK86tNHPpg0)\n* [Be Here Now - Ray LaMontagne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl3V0dTRDvI)\n* [Blackmill Feat.

5	I like everything. It all depends on what I'm in the mood for that day. My playlist has Bing Crosby next to Black Flag. \n\nSomebody I know once told somebody else about me "Don't hit shuffle on his music. You won't be able to handle the culture shock." 
2	I like lots of music but I most connect with bluegrass and the music of the Grateful Dead. 
2	I literally only listen to musicals, whoops :P
1	What’s up by 4 non blondes\nYou were meant for me by Jewel\n\nAre 2 songs i recently heard that made me nostalgic. I think they are perfect ENFJ songs 😅\n
1	Harry Belafonte - Jump In The Line\n\nThis would be my addition
1	Tool
1	I like electro swing, Jazz, symphonic metal (Nightwish), Abney Park, and miracle of sound.\nBut otherwise I just listen to what ever I find and like.
16	What kind of things ENFJ consider personal and only discuss with a close/special someone?	
27	For me, it’s my struggles and worries that I feel make it difficult for me to move forward in life. Usually ENFJs are the ones who are there for others and ask questions which allow for them to reflect and find their inner potential. \n\nIf a person is able to open me up and make me feel very comfortable, I’ll let the confident charismatic image down a bit and reveal things related to my difficult household and maybe how it’s affected my character to this day. It’s always nice when someone else is able to ask the questions and show that genuine interest but I’ll only reveal a vulnerable side in its full to those special people.
24	Deepest darkest secrets \n\nFamily \n\nPast relationships \n\nThings that I’m super passionate about but keep on the DL cause I know people will judge\n\nThings I know are holding me back \n\nThe extent of my self esteem issues \n\nOpinions/thoughts/expressions that I know could offend the other person or make them potentially feel uncomfortable
10	Things that I think people might judge me negatively for...
5	Not a got damm thing. \n\nI discuss my marriage (separated), fertility treatment, my mom's alcoholism, sexual assault, struggles at work, etc. I don't take out ads in the NYT, but I am extremely open about everything. \n\nExcept - there's one thing I don't talk about. And it's because I don't want people judging me. They're not living my life, don't know my needs, and can't possibly understand. 
3	personal problems my enfj bff does that to me
2	personal problems my enfj bff does that to me
1	In my case those would be family problems, my deepest fears and personal insecurities.\nFor me critisizing someone is also personal, for example: I only tell those close to me what I don't like about them, or what kind of behaviour is hurting me.\nIt doesn't mean that I won't speak up for myself when a person I don't consider very close is hurting me.\nIt's just not worth all the stress and I tolerate bad behaviour way too much just to nost offense anyone xD\n\n\n

INFJ here, wondering if you fellows could help me with some questions: I have to do a premise first - Due to the fact that you could be defined as our (INFJs) extroverted counterparts (same function but mainly outwardly used I guess)\nI was wondering if you could elaborate how do you perform social interactions with people in everyday life? I mean, how do you manage to talk about everyday life's arguments (such as weather, news, how's your fellows?, how's going the job?, yadda yadda)?\nIs there a particularly effective technique I can use in order to become more socially active in my everyday interactions?\nI have to say I really suck at small talk, nothing personal just can't do it properly, don't know how to approach it without boring myself to death.\nYou guys being generally more extroverted than we introverts, I was hoping in some enlightened answers to my questions... \nThanks everybody for reading and eventually answering me 🙏😊\nTake care!
13	I don’t know if I can speak for everyone, but I think what helps me get by with people is that I can quickly profile people based on first impressions and find out what sort of conversation they’d be into. For example, others may like to talk about people, events, or ideas. You kind of have to do a bit of prospecting in the beginning like a salesman and see what causes their eyes to glow. One thing you could do is listen in on the conversations of others and identify what ways they are conversing that is different from how you converse. I realized there are a lot of different ways to converse with people, down to the lengths of your statements or a particular vocabulary you’d like to use. Oh, and always always always be (or act) interested in the other person and show it through your actions or body gestures. Body language matters a lot more than you think. Recently, I read about a technique called ‘matching’ whereby you copy the vibe of the other person (not imitating each and every one of their actions). Normally I kind of go into conversations with 150% energy but I’m kind of intrigued by this ‘matching’ concept.\n\nThe second tip is to ‘defuse’ the person early. This is about making people feel comfortable talking to you. It’s quite easy to have a good conversation with a person you’re completely open to. Doing this is half what you say and half body language. There’s no cookie cutter way to do this but in general a genuine smile can go a long way. You can defuse them with a short joke or some self-deprecating humor (don’t over do it though). After that, the other person should feel comfortable with talking about most things.\n\nMost of this comes down to empathy- at least, if you want to appeal to people in general. You could totally just focus on your own hobbies and have people naturally come to you, but I think being able to initiate a good conversation with mostly anyone is a very fulfilling skill. In my idle time I like to think about why people felt a certain way as a consequence of my actions. This has helped me understand people deeply- and if my hypotheses turns out to be wrong, it becomes a learning experience :)
7	Get them to talk about themselves and then react positively and ask further questions about what they say. Steer them onto something else if you don’t agree with them on something. 
4	Simple, really - just talk about the other person! People love to talk about themselves, and they love a good listener. As they talk, you'll learn their interests, thoughts, ect and you can delve deeper by asking more specific questions.\n\nIf you get bored during small talk, practice staying present. Count breaths, both yours and the other persons, this is something practiced by Buddhists. 
4	I’m normally not a big fan of small talk, however it is used everyday an unavoidable in the daily routines of life. \n\nTherefore, almost every social interaction begins with a *genuine* “How are you?” I’m sure to look them in the eyes and smile. I want to show them that I actually want to know how they are doing, and I want to show them that I actually want to have a conversation with them. Generally, most people will just respond with, “I’m good,” or, “Fine,” etc. \n\nAlso, generally when you ask someone how they are doing, they will ask you back. Being an extrovert, I find it easy to talk, and the easiest thing for anyone to talk about is ourselves. This gives me the chance to talk about my day a little. Mention what I’ve done, who I’ve seen, etc. I may mention how the weather is nice so I’m in a good mood, or how the traffic was bad so I’m frustrated. \n\nThese small things that I talk about proceeding their question of “How are you?” gives a place for the conversation to go. Therefore, when I’m finish talking about how I’m doing, they have the chance to respond. Some people may choose to continue the conversation and some may not. \n\nIf they do not respond in a way that holds a conversation, I can always ask them about work or school. I can ask them “What have you been up to today?” or “What have you been up to lately?” If they are a stranger I can give them a kind comment on their clothes or their name, etc. This helps to keep conversation flowing in the case that they may not know what to say next. \n\nWhile that is how I generate small talk, many of the times I just have to feel out the situation and gauge what I should say and how I should respond. I always try to keep in mind that others may not want to talk or interact with me even though I may want to talk and interact with them. Sometimes people just want to be left alone, and that’s okay. 
5	Practice asking questions that provide people opportunities to share recent experiences rather than yes/no answers. For example, rather than, “how was your weekend?”, ask, “what did you do this weekend?”.  It’ll allow them to provide you with more context to ask more questions & it becomes a more personal conversation rather than two people being polite. 
3	I *also* suck at small talk and can't be bothered to do it properly because it bores me to death 😂 We have trickster Si so it's not much more of a help...\n\nGenerally, to be more sociable, if you actually wish that (which generally I stay away from because it's draining to have small talk), is to just *say stuff*. You have to embrace your Se more and stop over thinking it because it never helps. Practice holding eye contact with a smile like a silent hello. Start with a "Hi", or "I like your xyz". Even if you say the wrong thing, just laugh and smile and no one will care. Good vibes is what people remember and are looking for anyway. I have cultivated a really good musical laugh that I can break out to lighten the mood and put people at ease. Don't be afraid to be awkward and admit it.\n\nPeople also love talking about themselves, so just be curious and ask about where they got stuff, or compliment them... 🤷🏼‍♀️
2	It’s wrong to be something your not so if they don’t rub right with you , just be polite and go about your way. Accept not every person will like you and that’s perfectly normal and not a fault on your part. \nI try to ask a lot of questions to build a connection and avoid telling follow up stories to make a connection (this can be easily seen as ‘one upping’) . To break the ice I’ll say “why hello x how are you feeling today?” because it really lets them know there welcome right off the bat. Other good topics go move things along are “.Do you have any Netflix recommendations? I need new stuff to watch.” Just anything that they can prattle about on there terms till you find common ground . \n
1	Just get straight to the interesting stuff
10	I love you guys but...	I am getting driven crazy with this LDR! I love her to death and I'm not going to let anything stop us from getting married but when she gets caught up in school i get very little time with her. Finals are coming up for her so she's pretty scarce right now. It's just made that much worse since we're at an eight hour time difference. \n\nI've gotten very little out of her for the last month and a half! Trying to walk the line between showing my affection and wanting to talk with her and letting her do her own thing and get everything done is total cray cray. Trying not to come off as clingy but still there for her is kind of exhausting. I know how hard she works and how much pressure shes under but i cant help but feel a little left behind. She has time to go drinking, occasionally, and kick back with friends but i get 5 sentences out of her in a 2 weeks. She obviously is avoiding certain subjects, I'll be not life or death subjects, by ignoring my question and replying with cute cat pics.\n\nWe've had the conversation that I'm the one thing she doesnt have to worry about while shes over sea's so as to not add stress of keeping her fiance (me) happy. Like i said shes under a lot of pressure and stress already. A past relationship fucked up my head pretty bad and I've always thought she was too good for me (even before we were together as I've known her for 6 years). It's a real struggle fighting these thoughts in my head while trying to not add stress to her. I think because of the convo shes thinking we're safe and she can focus her attention on doing well, which was the whole point, but i still want some attention. \n\nI guess i just have to make it till christmas and I'll have her close for a whole week! \n\nSorry about the lengthy post lol. not officially asking for help on anything per say, just more of a vent.  
3	Focus on either building your life where you are or figure out how to join your fiancé overseas. Whatever on what your endgame is, begin to connect with people in-person. That’ll help keep you in the present. 
2	Take this for what it’s worth since you didn’t ask for advice but— This sounds temporary as she’s taking finals oversea’s and that you’re her fiancé. Good news is if you’re engaged then you clearly have a base to understand that she cares about you. \n\nFor what it’s worth, I agree the situation must be taxing with the time difference and the pressure she feels but I want to re-affirm what someone else commented— she’s making the best of her time, you make the best of your’s so that when she comes back she sees someone who is stronger and developed (in any way). \n\nI’ve been guilty of shutting down my life and my progress when I’m worried about my s/o and took me a long time to start thinking about myself in that picture too and I want the same for you. Others generally find it unattractive when we shut down over stuff like this, while we don’t understand how they can’t just at least shoot us a goodmorning/goodnight every day. Focus on what you can do today and you’ll be better for it when she gets back 
1	Why not Take up a hobby? The kind where u can pick it up at any point in time. Rock climbing running coding. Time to focus on the self should feel like a blessing. Properly done, it can also help spice the relationship. Best of luck!
1	Ughh that sounds so difficult I would have just gave up on her. Who responds with cat pics :sob: that's like mental torture. \nYou're amazing for lasting so long. \nGood luck.
6	How can you tell if you (or a friend!) are ‘special’ to an ENFJ?	
26	They tell you
11	they make an effort to spend time with you and they are open about their problems this they trust you
8	For me personally, I know a person is really special if I am able to express anger/disapproval towards them. It’s hard for me to stand up for myself, but I always can to people I love most.
5	If they confide you their problems or weaknesses, you are someone VERY special to them.
3	They show you a side to them that they don't show others. 
9	ENFJ Male And INFJ Female attraction...?	I met a male ENFJ through my school, and needless to say I kinda fell. But I don’t want to fall. I’m an INFJ female who’s recently getting over and INTP, while royally messed me up but I still care for the guy. \n\nThen suddenly this ENFJ came along. I feel like the wind got knocked out of me!! My best friend is a female ENFJ, so I know the type fairly well, and usually love y’all to death. I’m just lost with him though, which is probably because I have feelings for him. \n\nMy question is how do I discern if they have feelings back? Or if they are classically flirting with everyone. (I mean I flirt too, in my introvert way lol) \n\nHe’s very characteristically physical touch. We don’t know each other super well, but if I’m alone he will come up to me and pretend to bump me or “hurt” my leg or something. He started talking about music with me (like heck yes ah so lit— NFJ’s we have great music taste lol) \n\nSeems to look at me when I laugh... \n\nThe strangest thing that happened was when I was leaving for class one day. It was just us two and slowly I packed my stuff up and so did he. He left a little earlier than me and then I followed. He walked extremely slow up the stairs, I caught up. He held the door for me and then said suddenly, “hey I have a question for you”\n\nMeanwhile I’m all excited cause like y’all this is interesting!!! \n\n\nHe asks me if I’m in this group with his best friend (who is an INFP female) \n\nI say no cause I’m not. \n\nMention how I met his BFF at this event. \n\nHe says how he, “had heard about that” \n\nI’m like woooaaaahhh waahhttt\n\n\nThen he says he’s gotta go and we both leave in opposite directions. \n\n\n\nEven kept telling me to join this dance club on campus—bringing it up at two different times in a day. (Ohhh big deal.... ok I’m still leaving it in here tho lol) \n\n\nAlso asked what my middle name was and said it was beautiful. \n\n(Yeet my sanity lmao) \n\n\nAs my best friend ENFJ quotes from Hoizer: “I fall in love just a little ol little bit everyday with someone new” \n\nSo idk how legitimate all this is. And also, I’m kinda afraid based off of the rocky INTP relationship. It scares me that I can’t fully read this ENFJ, and I can’t tell if I’m just another girl that he flirts with, or maybe something could happen? \n\n\n
6	I might be a bit prudent here, but I think it’s best to wait things out. 
6	You could ask him? My husband is an ENFJ and he's just as honest/blunt as I am. 
5	You're getting excited over absolutely nothing. Not saying it won't happen, but... well, nothing you told us indicates anything is happening right now except you getting starry eyed for him. You want to ask him out? Do it. But if you want us to tell you he has fallen for you as well, that's not the case. ENFJs might come across as flirty because of their easy-to-get-along personality but even then I don't think he's hitting on you. That's just your hormones getting the better of you.\n\nI know some INFJs can get offended when confronted with facts as opposed to feelings so let me leave this comment here with this disclaimer: Source- I'm an INFJ male with an ENFJ girlfriend.
-1	Be careful with ENFJ males.
12	Forbidden Romantic Interest At Work	So, I work for someone who I think is an ENFJ, and I'm really attracted to her. Sometimes I feel like she's attracted to me, too, but typing her as an ENFJ and reading about how ENFJs can act with people in general has me really questioning it. Our work policy is that we're not allowed to date each other even if we're interested in each other. This would be the case even if we were just co-workers. I have no plans of staying at this job long term, so this is not a long-term problem. This time next year, I doubt I will be working there.\n\nI guess I'm just wondering how some ENFJs would act if they were in a situation where it's not okay to be direct about their interest in someone. Some of the things I've noticed from her are:\n\n* She compliments me a lot and hardly ever compliments my co-workers. They're mostly work-related compliments, but I've never really heard her compliment anyone else. She is not unhappy with anyone's work at all, so it's not necessarily like I'm doing that much better than anyone else.\n* There has been some prolonged eye contact. One time it really stood out. We kept catching each other's eye from across the room over the course of about an hour and 15 minutes, and she never broke eye contact--always me, because I didn't want her to think I was staring at her (but I couldn't stop looking at her because I'd look and she was almost always looking at me and never looked away before I did any of those times).\n* She has recently started teasing me. I've only seen her tease one other person, and everyone teases him because of his personality. I'm pretty surprised she started teasing me because I act a lot more serious than everyone else at my job, and she generally matches my demeanor when we're interacting (she's not really naturally a serious person, I don't think). When she teases me, I tease back and she said she didn't think I would do that.\n* She pretty much takes all of my suggestions/feedback/ideas. My dad has joked that I go to work and tell the boss what to do. She knows I hate meetings, and so now she cancels them more often. I even just didn't show up to one, and nothing happened. She knew I wasn't there because she asked me about a question that came up in the meeting.\n* She kept trying to talk me into coming to an after-hours event that others in our department were attending, and when I didn't come she kept talking about how I didn't come/how I should have come. She said she will keep trying to talk me into attending these after-hours events.\n\nAny thoughts? **How would you act if you liked someone at a job where co-workers dating was forbidden?** I test as an ISTJ/INTJ (I usually get INTJ but have gotten ISTJ), if that makes any difference. I do think she prefers introverts.
4	ENFJ Male here and I work in a corporate office environment, hope this helps.\n\nTred carefully my friend, ENFJs like attention and enjoy being friendly and flirty sometimes just for fun. Especially in a boring work environment. Although it’s said that while ENFJs have very extroverted mannerisms and demeanor their eyes are introverted and can see deep into the other person. I’m very careful with my eye contact and have had some people say “why are you looking at me like that” or “why are you staring at me”. So the fact that she’s holding eye contact with you tells me that she’s trying to size you up and maybe see how you feel about her. Also, the fact that she’s inviting you out is the most promising. Her interactions with you in the office are extremely limited so I encourage you to take her up on the offer to hangout after work and see how it goes. Also the way she is “teasing you” for not going, is her way of letting you know she missed you and wants you there. As for the rules... to the hell with them... 
2	If work place relations are not allowed, then why is she inviting you to after hours work type functions, if you claim she is interested? If she was really interested, wouldn't she invite you to a non work type function? 
2	My bf is an ISTJ and I'm an ENFJ. Gosh I love him.\n\nI have no other helpful words. Just that ENFJs are huge fans of ISTJs. 
2	If she treats you differently from everyone else, then she's obviously got a thing for you!\n
15	ENFJ/ISTP Relationship Advice?	I'm a female ENFJ, and my new boyfriend is an ISTP.... I know.\n\nI am really anxious about our relationship. Not because I don't like him. I really really really like him. We have similar senses of humor, we're sexually compatible, he's affectionate and not afraid of PDA/general affection (as am I). BUT. He is a really poor verbal communicator and I am absolutely paranoid of scaring him off by being too feelings-y or being too open. But that's how I generally communicate, so I'm conflicted. I cannot stand not knowing what he's thinking and feeling. He could be deciding that I'm not worth dating for all I know but dammit I can't tell!!! As an ENFJ and person with an anxiety disorder, I cannot stop worrying about if/how much he truly likes me as much as he sometimes says he does. For instance, we had a date recently and he kept complimenting me all night, but then when we hung out a few days after that he almost just treated me the same way he did when we were still just casually dating- not very emotionally attached.\n\nMy question is, **how do we make this work**? How does an ENFJ go about fulfilling the relationship needs of an ISTP, and how does an ENFJ ensure she gets her needs fulfilled from the ISTP? I'm so afraid we're going to fall victim to horrible communication and I'll just go nuts trying to please him all the time, which will surely also just make me come across as overbearing. 
9	I'm dating an ISFP so I'll share advice based on what's worked for me, ymmv.\n\nhe may not always open up. that's ok. we are an open and communicative breed. not everyone is like that. just learn when you need to step in, and don't be afraid to sit back and let him figure his shit out himself sometimes.\n\nideally he will still appreciate your openness. don't hold back about communicating your own feelings and needs. the onus may be on you to initiate these kinds of conversations more often than not. \n\nit will take courage to trust him and trust your own needs. as a fellow ENFJ with anxiety, my current relationship and my last relationship with an ENTP have forced me out of my comfort zone in this regard and overall my anxiety is much better for it. this is a chance for you to grow.\n
8	Hi also enfj with anxiety. My ex was an ISTP and it was one of the hardest but also one of the best relationships I was ever in. Ofc not every ENFJ/ISTP is the same, but we really had to take time to learn about and adapt to eachother.\n\nI had to learn not to assume he didn't love me/care because of minute actions or lack of explicit affection/attention. He had to learn to reassure me once in a while and just check in to make sure I was ok. He had to learn to RESPOND TO MY TEXTS and not leave them on "read" because I felt so destroyed by what I thought was him ignoring me. \n\nI had to learn that sometimes he's just really focused on whatever is in front of him, and that sometimes he was just a bit tact less and couldn't quite read people's emotions. I had to learn to be a lot more explicit about how I was feeling, and learn that he was just a bad texter and sometimes words and articulation of feelings didn't come as naturally to him. \n\nI learned that he was much more tangible and physical and logical whereas I was more in my head in ideas and theories and emotions.  It was honestly really hard to understand each other sometimes, but we really complemented each other because we were so different, and really came to respect and admire each other's strengths. \n\nIt helped me a lot to embrace the "growth" mindset of relationships, as opposed to the "destiny" mindset.. The former encourages and embraces conflict as an opportunity to learn more about and adapt to each other, whereas the latter feels like a big red flag that tells you to run because any incompatibility means it's the wrong person. This doesn't have to be true! Can be amazing but be prepared to communicate a loooot and put in a lot of work! It will be worth it and will only make you two stronger.\n\nI don't know if this is the case for your ISTP but, I also learned he liked handmade gifts and that encouraged me to develop my artsy side too.. ☺️  \n\nGood luck op! Don't let your insecurities/anxieties get to you! Just ask for clarification, and if he really cares and is a good one, he will reassure you and not make you feel bad for worrying. \n\nOh one last thing - it helped us to articulate exactly how we wanted to be responded to, because it was so foreign to us. I..e. If I was upset id want to talk it out and would want him to ask questions to make me feel like he cared and wanted to listen, whereas he would NOT want to talk about it, but would rather have a hug and kiss and be dragged outside with  an activity so he could forget about it. \n\nWe had to learn to treat each other like THEY wanted to be treated, not how we wanted to be treated. Good lesson for most people I think. \n\n\n\n\n
7	Relax and let loose a bit XD \n\nYou could try writing down all your worries and then cherry pick the ones you want to communicate with him. \nWe ENFJs are probably a tad too passionate/dramatic and emotional for the other types, so letting it out in small doses would be fine, I think. \n\n
6	My husband is an ISTP been together 9 years now. Every one of those years new lessons on how to deal with each other have been learned. I’d say most importantly he will need his “me time” let him have it and don’t crowd him. Make sure you have friendship the extrovert in you can have an outlet. Understand that we are emotionally demanding and they can’t deal with that sometimes. Be okay with the fact that he is going to need time to develop his ideas and thoughts, you won’t get an answer out of him immediately. Make sure he doesn’t get overly angry about simple request. I’ve had  Many conversations with my husband after he gets frustrated  my emotions, he gets angry. I have to explain that although he hates emotions, anger is also an emotion. Also call out ( in a nice way) when they aren’t being clear in their wants or explanations, that’s how we get a better understanding of them :) 
3	To add to my long ass reply earlier, take the love languages test. I scored high on positive affirmation and his top one was physical touch. It helped to understand how we each naturally showed love, how to comprehend when the other was trying to communicate love, and how we could accommodate and express in the others' preferred love language a bit more. \n\n
2	ISTP (m) in ltr with ENFJ (f) here. It works, you're both going to grow A LOT. Like, more than you could possibly imagine. But when the dust settles, you're going to have a partner who is the exact mirror opposite skillset to yours, which makes your team appear to have all the superpowers.\n\nHe is going to have to learn to process emotions. They are subtle for him, it's not always clear to him what he's feeling. But if he's spending time with you, he has decided to be with you. It's honestly that simple. He's not pondering if it's worth while, that thought process was completed a long time ago. \n\nYou're going to have to learn to be patient, and trust him when he is speaking about emotions. That thought process is going to happen sloooooooow at first. Glacial, by your standards. But when he has come up with something, there isn't any reading between the lines to be done. Take it at EXACTLY face value, he is being as specific and clear as he possibly can.\n\nGood luck, the battle is long but all worth while things are difficult.
9	WHERE DO YOU GUYS HANG OUT?!?	I love ENFJs (and I'm shy), but don't know where to find you guys. So, are there places where it is easier to find ENFJs?\n\nPS: What happens when you interact with another ENFJ?
15	ENFJs, in their natural habitat, will be commonly found near their friends. in case an ENFJ is alone, it's because they are working, or studying, or tidying up their place. \n\nsource: am ENFJ, am either at events with friends, hiking or hanging out with bf, or reading somewhere populated like a public library or cafe. can also be found perusing 2nd-hand bookstores. 
10	I’m a super social yet (sometimes) super shy ENFJ. Some days I can lead workshops with 150 people, and on others I blush when someone talks to me in the store. I guess we’re all different. 
1	Find the thumb that sticks out, or the person living the change that is needed.  Find the one that needs to laugh and the one that accepts everyone else.
237	There's a few things every ENFJ needs to hear	Hi ENFJ's. I'm not sure who's reading this right now, where it's being read, or when someone's eyes are skimming this. For all I know, someone is accessing this archived post five years from now. But regardless of time or place, there are a few things that need to be said to any ENFJ out there. \n\nTo start off....\n\n**You are SO impactful**\n\nSeriously. You have a way of connecting with people in a realm outside the normal day-to-day routine. It's like everyone else is in a bubble of small-talk and short-term worries, and you're able to lift them out of that just by talking to them. For even just those few moments, they feel important, because they have your undivided attention and you make them feel like they are SO interesting. That, in of itself, is so impactful to so many people. Do you know how rare it is for some people to get to feel that way? You make people feel like you care about them because YOU DO. You really do. It's so genuine it's completely disarming.\n\n**You are so socially astute it's almost scary**\n\nYou can connect the patterns between motive and behavior on an absolutely uncanny level. It's almost like a superpower, being able to read and monitor the energy levels in a social situation. With just a single sentence, you can swoop in and completely change the atmosphere of the room. You are the ultimate party planner, and the people close to you greatly appreciate it and most likely don't express that enough (not your fault for being so amazing, right?) \n\n**People are drawn to you, don't be afraid of that.**\n\nYou are the life of the party, even if all you're doing is talking with your friends in the corner. Everyone else is glancing around, self-conscious, but your ability to relax as you focus entirely on the person you're talking with stands out like a beacon. When you laugh, it's genuine. You seem so confident, so aware of your social surroundings, that people will cling to you like a lifeboat in a storm of uncertain social circumstances. And you are more than happy to provide them a safe passage.\n\n**Be as kind to yourself as you are to other people.**\n\nYou give everyone else so many chances to make mistakes, probably too many if you're honest about it, and yet the slightest moment you slip up in any capacity you absolutely tear yourself to shreds over it. When you take a step back and compare the two, it's really sad, because you don't deserve that. You deserve the happiness you give other people. \n\n*Treat yourself the way you would treat your closest friend.*\n\n**Thank You** \n\nThere are a million more words I could write about how amazing you are. Your brain might be working in a million different directions at once at any given time, and you may be a bit messy and get overwhelmed sometimes. But goddamnit you **TRY**. \n\nIn a world where not caring is the easy route, you take the long road. You're not perfect, and you're the last person to say you are, and sometimes while trying to take care of everyone else you make a mistake. And *THAT'S OKAY*. Because you do more for your friends, family, and people that you care about than anyone else around you. Hell, you do more to make that random solo person at a party comfortable than most people do for their actual friends. \n\nYou're not afraid to care and try, and your vulnerability is your *STRENGTH*. Your ability to instantly connect on such a deep level with people requires self-sacrifice, and that often comes in the form of making yourself open and vulnerable, which is must too high of a price for most people. Not you though. \n\nYou are a shining light in the darkness for a lot of people around you. It's really hard when you feel like you're shining in the dark by yourself, but you have so many people gathered around you in the shadows ready to help you the way that you've helped them. You may not believe me, because after all, the last person to ever consider asking for help is often the one who helps everyone else. But trust me, you have an ability to make people feel connected to you in an extremely rare way, and those people are there for you. \n\n*Remember to give others the opportunity to give to you*\n\n**You are unique. You are impactful. You are special. You are appreciated. You are needed.**\n\nThank you for what you do \n\nedit: minor grammar and format stuff, keep rocking on ENFJ's. Changing the world one conversation at a time
43	I really needed to hear this today, thank you!
26	Wow this is exactly what I needed to read today. Thank you! 
22	The part about being kind to yourself really spoke to me. I don’t take a lot of things others say or do too personally and let things slide but I do put too much pressure on myself. I hate the feeling I’ve let someone down by slipping up in some way, and I definitely rip myself to shreds over it. \n\nFailure and rejection are really difficult to deal with. I can usually try to keep positive and distract myself but the more frequent it is it really breaks me down and I spiral really quickly when I am alone. My husband only really sees when this happens, usually coming home to me in tears when I’m just at my limit. It’s also hard to reach out for help. It’s only really when I’m so exhausted that I can’t keep the “I’m fine” mask on anymore I let people in and see me at my worst. Still then it’s only really my husband.\n\nThe vulnerability is true. I when can express my vulnerability in words and have made sense of things I can open up to others about it, but that’s usually after I’ve given myself the chance alone to feel the whirlwind of emotions out.\n\nAnyways thank you for this post. You really know ENFJs :)
18	That first thing you said about us ligting people up and all that. Its actually kind of frustrating, because we try to do that but at the end of the day I usually feel like I had a short term impact. In that moment that person is as motivated and positive as I am, but afterwards they revert back to their former mindset. So it doesn't feel like I achieved anything.
7	Be kind to yourself!  This.  This. This.  
5	Awwwwww this is really so sweet of you!!! I cried!!! :'( Thank you so much!!! You also deserve all the love and happiness!!! Thank you for making our day or week or month or year! :D
6	Saving this. 😭😭😭
5	We are enfj afterall. It is known 
5	Idk if these tears are from your post or this YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITd5pesVjpY) I am watching, but I thank you for your heartfelt write up. This is what my soul needed on a day like this. Thank you OP 
4	This was so nice to read. Thank you for writing this!
4	Thank you. 
4	i'm pinning this because it's what we need right now xD
5	No, OP, **you are** <3\n\nTnx :) 
4	Thank you, I appreciate this a lot. I actually needed to hear this. I put a lot of pressure on myself in school. You have no idea. It's nice to hear how important I am. How important ENFJs are in general. Again, thank you. 😊😇
5	Legendary, thanks for sharing 
3	thank you. today i made sure that 3 of my close friends get the hard love that they deserve. then i read this and i was like, "oh yeah, i guess i did all this today". it's because i know that they deserve the love and care that they need, just like everyone else. everyone deserves to be cared for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\npeace! again, thank you for sharing this.
3	Pretty sure this is an ISTP description
3	Your words about being kind to yourself. That's so  true. I have a tendency to be really hard on myself for making mistakes. Even small ones. And dwell way too much on the big ones. Im still kicking myself for things i did 10 years ago! I need to be nice to myself.\n\nThanks
3	This post was a great motivator for me, a fellow ENFJ today. Thank you for doing this. 
2	Cried a little reading this. Thank you so much. We love you too!!!
2	Thanks OP. Just curious, whats your mbti?\n
2	You are a miracle OP, and a wonderful person.  I trust you to the moon, and love you for the love and truth you provide to me <3
2	Thank you so much, i didn’t expect it and made me really happy. Just saved :) you’re awesome!! 
2	You are beatiful my friend. I really needed this today!!!!!! <3
2	I love this! Yes, you're totally right—keep on rockin'! This makes me so happy! As well, to know we have people like you in the world brightens up my day!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep on rockin'!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSalut!
2	You are such a wonderful person for putting this here <3 There are so much clarity and insight, and the advice are needed for people like us. Thank you for the reminder, I've read it over a few times and will again. It's a treasure for me <3
2	Thank you! I really need to hear the words that I already know about, but have a hard time accepting it for myself. I 100% agree with everything said here (it's a bit uncanny).
2	I’ve been in a slump since May. Even my best friends have been able to pick up on it and asking if I’m alright but I shrug it off like I’m fine.\n\nI’m not as talkative as usual, I’m not as jovial or confident, and I spend a lot of time at home in my room. I want to feel better but I’m not sure how to escape this pit I’ve fallen into.\n\nSometimes posts like these give me motivation for at least a day. Thank you.
2	Thank you so much for this! 
2	I'm very late to the party, but at the same time, I guess I'm not :). Thank you for your post. It encapsulated a lot of feelings I have had over the years. These feelings took time and patience to 'truly' discern. Your post helped provide another solid footing as reassurance that I am working towards a better path for my life. Take care now! 
2	Wow
2	I suppose this is very complimentary to the individuated exemplar of humanity hazily described here.   I'm on a MBTI forum so there's a clearly a level of credence I give to this stuff, but this feels masturbatory. Who doesn't like to be told they're a great person?  Let's challenge this a bit.\n\nAnd I identify as ENFJ.
2	INFP here, can confirm most of the points in this post.
2	I love you and I got you
2	To be honest, I couldn't even read half of it, I just skimmed through. I believe that the message is good, true and positive, however it made me really uncomfortable. I'm really not good with any kind of compliment, and when it comes to my personality and someone praising it, it makes me feel ashamed, self conscious and undeserving of it because I'm so far away of being that good as people sometimes perceive me. 
2	This made my week & made me cry. Thank you so much for writing this. It's exactly what I needed. 
2	Crying. Thank you <3
2	"Treat yourself the way you would treat your closest friend." Hitting us all right where it hurts. In the feels.
2	I started tearing up as I began reading this!\n\nIn my desire to change the world around me, there are so many moments I wonder if anything is sticking or if anyone is even like me or if it matters.\n\nThank you, fellow ENFJ, for writing this reminder to us all! You ROCK!
0	INTP gang says\n\n\nheck off
24	Please help me with this	I'm an ENFJ, I am 15 years old and I seem to have a problem where I try to help people too hard if that makes sense, I keep pressing on them to talk about their personal problems and I can't seem to understand that some people don't want to and end up hurting them more than helping, I hope that someone here that is more mature can tell me how they dealt with it if they have and thank for your time if you're reading this.
11	I was (and sometimes am still) like that. For me, something happened that shifted me permanently. I was away at college and talking to my sister over the phone and kept trying to help and insisting on her telling me more so I could help her. She snapped and said angrily/annoyingly, "when you push and pry too much, it makes me want to stop talking to you and not tell you anything at all." I had realized then that I need to know that other people had boundaries and limits and comfort zones too and that sometimes I need to back off. Sometimes I can be overbearing. That moment really shook me because my sister had never said this before and I was honestly trying to help and I hated making her react that way. Now if I ever find myself being a little too much for someone, I take a step back and give them space but tell them that I am always there when/if they're ready. 
6	I’m 25 now and have learned we like to air out all of our emotions to others and it makes us feel better; however, this is not how “most” people feel. \n\nMany people are guarded and want to be left alone when dealing with pain until they’re ready to open up (if ever). The funny thing though is you feel their pain and your natural inclination is to help them and if you don’t help them, you feel bad about not helping. \n\nIt took me a long long time to adjust my heart to follow my head in recognizing that I’m actually hurting when I pry too much. Effectively helping is an art, not a science and sometimes a hug and “I’m here for you if you need it, I’m sorry” is all you can do. \n\nYou have a kind heart, don’t lose that. You will learn to balance your heart with your head over the years to come and it will help a lot. 
4	I'm right there with you. And it's honestly more about experience and self awareness than maturity. With time will come the ability. I live with a roommate who is incredibly self reliant and I don't get it sometimes. She'll tell me she' upset but I can't do anything. But I try to view it less as 'she doesn't want my help' and more as 'she trusts to tell me she needs to deal with her own issues'. \n\nI hope this helps buddy! You're great for caring and don't stop. People appreciate it. 
3	It happened many...MANY times in life.\n\nThey are just not comfortable to share it or they are not comfortable to share it With You, because based on what you have done, they are afraid that you will say judgemental things they don't want to hear or to give advices which seem too hard for them.\n\nWe see that as a way to fix problems in our best demeanor, while, for some, they think we are just poking where their wounds are with our words.\n\nWhat I learned finally of what to do about this: I listen, I tell them I understand what they feel, and tell them I'd love to say something to comfort you but it's best not to cause they aren't practical right now.\n\nYou are 15 and life is still so long ahead, stay curious and passionate like the way you are now! You can also start cultivate yourself as an elegant gentleman/lady by respecting others when they refuse to tell you. They will come to you much more when you don't seem interested in their business.
3	I was like that at your age as well. Our intent is good and we 'feel' something has to be done but we are not understanding that they process things differently.  \n\nTake a look at this [theory of change](https://psychcentral.com/lib/stages-of-change/). Maybe it can help you have insight into the general process of change and you can have more understanding of where people may be.\n\n&#x200B;
3	Helloooo. 23yo male ENFJ here-\n\nI feel like I went through the same thing when I was in high school and there are still pockets of time where I experience this feeling of coming off too strong. \n\nNaturally we ENFJ’s are people pleasers, sometimes to the point where we lose focus on ourselves completely and even sacrifice our own morals and beliefs for a sec. \n\nYou’re still young. Fifteen is the beginning of high school and around the point where our relationships and environment become a little more complicated and intense. There’s suddenly more people around, more things to balance, and more connections you crave to make. \n \nAll I see is a young person who’s starting to develop in their own personality type. Your Fe is just starting to show very strongly, it is our dominant function after all haha. It’s nothing to be afraid of, rather something to embrace. \n\nI think it’s great you’ve already gotten to a point where you can see how it can be overbearing for others. I only realized that in the past three years that everyone is different and everyone deals with life in different ways. We ENFJ’s may feel like we’re helping but to the opposing party it can come off intimidating, strong, and unnecessary.\n\nAnd so that’s what developing our personality types are all about I feel. Seeing how we’re affected by others and how we can affect others. Through time, practicing interpersonal communication, experience, reflection, awareness, and more understanding of our own personality, you’ll be able to gauge better how to help people and also gauge the kinds of helps they’d be comfortable with. It’s a journey! Enjoy! \n\nRemember to be a helper, not a pleaser. :) 
2	A somewhat bad solution could be helping them without them knowing. Of course, if the only help you can offer is telling solutions or giving advice, yes, sometimes people really hate it.
2	: ) haha I never ask people about their problems! \nSometimes when they talk about it, and I try to give solutions, they also get angry!\nSo I just stay with people who like to listen to my various solutions. Ahaha \nPeople who don't like it? Just say nothing at all \n; P since what they want a simply a listening ear. 
2	I’m the same way. Some people would consider me nosy, but myself (and many other ENFJ’s out there) genuinely care very deeply about anyone that’s around me, and want to know the heart of the issue so I can do everything I can to help out. If you feel the same way here’s what I do before I talk to someone about something personal, or that I don’t want to seem like I’m too nosy...\n\nI always preface my advice with “hey, I’ve noticed that somethings changed. Is that true?”\n\nThis opens up the conversation without talking about the actual issue itself. You’re going to only use ‘I’ statements (ex. “I feel like there may be something weird going on. Is everything ok?”., etc.) to not judge or criticize, but rather come from a place of care. \n\nIf they say “no”, obviously just share your concern and move on. “Well I misunderstood, but I’m always here to talk if you need it”. No need to help people that aren’t ready for help. Sometimes life needs to kick somebody’s ass a lil before they want help/or want change from a bad situation. \n\nIf they say “yes”, I would approach it cautiously. You can’t force anyone to open up to you, or share their truth with you. They will come to you.\n\n“Do you want to talk about it? It’s okay if you don’t, I know I can be a bit nosy at times.”  Or “if you’d like to talk about it I’m always here, just want to throw that out there”... \n\n
2	totally understandable. i'm 36 and i still need to remind myself that sometimes, people just want to be heard so that they can process what's on their mind and they can figure the solution out for themselves. as ENFJ's we're sort of built to want to help others and make sure they're ok, but we need to remind ourselves that some people can figure that out for themselves. we need to be great listeners and supporters. 
11	Ideal love match: take the test here!	Everyone wants an ENFJ. But who does ENFJ want? \n\n\nCurious to what would be each types love match. Some people get their own type, or opposite, ect. \n\nThe main piece of advice I have is don’t answer to what you think your ideal type should be(for example if your an ENFP, don’t answer the questions to try and and get the INTJ) just be true to your honest Preferences. \n\n[quiz here](https://www.truity.com/test/personality-type-love-match)\n\n1. State your own type and gender. \n\n2. State the type you got from the quiz above! \n\n
18	ENFJ, Female.\n\nENFJ.\n\nI'm doomed. XD
11	I’m an ENFJ guy that got a match w/ ENFJs. Sounds about right haha

4	I got ENTJ which is... not accurate\n\nit's ISFP
3	1. ENFJ Male.\n2. ENTJ 😉
3	I defenitly do not want an enfj. 😂
3	ENFJ male and also got an ENFJ lol
3	I’ve noticed a lot of ya enfj’s get enfj as a preferred partner. Maybe there should be an enfj hookup subreddit lol
3	I think most people are getting their own types because they want someone who would actually give back. Ideals..they don't really carry into reality.
2	Wow it’s crazy how so many of us matched with other ENFJs! My brother is also an ENFJ so maybe a reason why I didn’t get that answer too :P\n\nI’m a female ENFJ, I got INTJ lol\n\nMarried to a male INFJ. I find both types have a lot in common. 
2	1. ENFJ, Female\n2. ENTJ\nHehehe.... 🤭
2	ENFJ - ENFJ \n\nWut O\_o
2	ENFJ female\n\nMatched with an ENFJ\n 🤔😂

1	ENFJ female - I got INFJ
1	Infp female \n\nGot enfj \n\nThought I was going to get intj for my ideal love match because I'm usually attracted to them and my boyfriend happens to be one. \n\nBut what?? Enfj is what I got, which is surprising.
1	ENFJ Female, INTP which is actually my dream
1	enfj- match is an entp. weird as 'talking' to someone and really like him
1	Me: ENFJ female \nIdeal match: ENFJ male.\n\nAfter having a whirlwind romance with my exact opposite ISTP, maybe this could be interesting to explore. Never thought about dating someone like myself but the more I think about it my ideal match is someone who approaches the world and solving problems in a manner similar to mine. \n
1	ENFJ male -> INFJ 
11	Favorite ENFJ characters	What are your favorite enfj characters? \nMine are hashirama senju from naruto, wonder woman and shanks from one piece\nWhat are yours?
31	Margery Tyrell from Game of Thrones is thought to be an ENFJ. She possesses both the positive traits (charm, caring for the poor, determination) and negative traits (sly manipulation and social climbing) of an ENFJ.
15	I actually normally sort of hate other ENFJ fictional characters. Mufasa’s alright though. Lol
5	Me
3	Didn’t think about Shanks being an ENFJ. That’s pretty cool. My favorite is Sinbad from Magi 
3	Mary Poppins
4	Gandalf
3	Remus Lupin (Harry Potter)\n\nLoki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\n\nEmma Woodhouse (Jane Austen's Emma) (I have a soft spot for Frank Churchill, even if it isn't widely accepted as an ENFJ himself)\n\nRegina Mills (Once Upon a Time)\n\nSallie McBride (Dear Enemy)
3	The bunny in Zootopia
1	Would Billy Bob Thornton's Billy McBride on Amazon's Goliath be an ENFJ?
1	Years ago, I had a crush on Alan Shore from Boston Legal.  I am not sure his type but an ENFJ makes sense...I think.  (an ENFJ with self esteem / self image problems.)
1	ELIZABETH BENNET!!! DAENERYS TARGARYEN!!! 
6	Probably a long shot but ..	Can you lot create an imaginary character, real or inspired and converse with them in your head?
10	Not really... I'm not good at holding people with complexity in my mind. It's a lot easier to talk to different parts of myself that to try and create a whole other person.
7	I write and act and do a lot of stuff that implies creating characters, and I rarely see them as different people, just amplified parts of myself if that makes sense? Like they’re all a part of me, so I don’t have to try and imagine how they would act, I just know it
2	Yep all the time easily 
1	anyone can make a tulpa
1	I can't. In fact, I have a hard time keeping a character's voice unless I can identify with their life experiences directly. I can create a character and put them in my own situation to see posible outcomes for situations, though.
1	I find the multitude of other voices and sub-personalities speak up in different manners.  They are the voice of my conscience, my mother, my father, the teacher, the listener.  The imagined characters flesh themselves out through journaling, a critical means by which an ENFJ can make sense of the world.
1	I stopped having imaginary friends around 8 b/c I pivoted my inner creative ideas. The imaginary friends were *poof* gone the day I started quoting lines and reenacting scenes from movies. \n\nMy friends say I’m very good at accents, impersonations of others, being very animated in my expressions. 
15	Let's make r/Idealists less dead	r/Idealists\n\nIt's for NFs
10	But   all our ideals and dreams are dead.
11	ENFJ AMA P2. change the way you go about things	Check out previous [AMA ENFJs and Relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/enfj/comments/9le99s/ama_enfjs_and_relationships/)\n\nA common thing I see people run into is problems that keep reoccurring.  It could be running into the same issue of relationships not working out. Or it could be that you happen to find difficulty resolving conflicts with others. Maybe you find it difficult to make or keep ships with others.  It can even come down to not being able to hold a job or get good grades.\n\nI decided to do these AMAs to tackle issues I’ve been seeing across the subreddit that other ENFJs/MBTI types have been asking about.  These are all my own opinions and what I advise may not work for everyone.\n\nPeople are creatures of habit and tend to fall into the same cycle of events based on their choices.  This is probably why people who are stuck in toxic situations, typically find it hard to break out of it.  Usually the reason being is because people try to resolve their issues using the same method over and over again.  There are many ways to go about handling different situations and people, and it’s more effective to identify what does and does not work.  Go with what works, and drop what doesn’t work.  Looking at different perspectives and gathering input from other people really helps you in progressing through life.  You may not agree with what you find, but imagine if you were working on a project with different people.  There’s many ways you can go about completing the project.  You can talk to a bunch of people and work together to create something amazing.  Other groups could be working on the same project but have it turn out massively different from your project.  My point is the outcome can change with different methodologies.  Don’t be afraid to try something new!\n\nFor example, someone who can’t really hold a relationship, reason being is because they can’t commit but yearn for someone to be with them on the long run.  They would try to solve their problem by just changing friend groups, meeting someone else and going through the same exact motions they did with their previous partner.  Then as soon as they lose interest, they bail.  Obviously, this kind of thinking doesn’t really change anything for future potential dates.  Said person would need to change their mindset and try something different instead of the same usual method they are comfortable with, but doesn’t work.\n\nAnother example can be dating or finding that good group of friends.  Like say a certain type of persons gravitate towards you.  However, you find yourself extremely unhappy or it doesn’t work out.  Like a cliché, “you are attracted to someone who’s not good for you”.  Best way to go about this is to hang out with someone with a different personality.  Instead of going for the “rebel”, try someone who’s more “lowkey”.  First impressions are important, but I’ve learned that some friendships don’t blossom until after a few hangouts.  Later on you find things you have in common and then develop into best friends or something more.  I personally use to party a lot and found the crowd to be extremely toxic for me, and so I decided to switch it up and hang out with people who enjoy occasionally going out but also ok with just enjoying each others company.  Our interests are board/video games and other nerdy stuff.  The party group I use to hang out with enjoyed nerdy stuff, but with them I felt like I ended up doing a lot of dangerous stuff that I can’t really handle anymore. \n\nOverall, if you find yourself stuck with a reoccurring problem, try something different or do the opposite of what you’re doing now. Don’t like people taking advantage of you? Learn how to say no.  Finding that this type of person isn’t treating you well, hang out with a different type of person. Having difficulty communicating your feels?  Try expressing them through text or maybe other mediums of communication. If you try to fit a block through a hole in the shape of a circle, it won’t really work.\n\nIt also helps to try to keep an open mind and be ok with change.  It's very difficult to actually put this into practice and that's ok.  You go through life figuring out what you wanna believe in and as time goes on it's harder to break free from experience.  Mindset is a powerful thing and if you have a flexible mindset, you'll find that you won't be as stressed about stuff as much.\n\nMy current life change is changing the way I eat and living a more active lifestyle.  I really am lazy at heart and have hit a point where I feel like I'm unhealthy, so I'm trying to break free from eating junk food and being sedantary. I'm also working on improving how I help others in my life.  I really want my friends to succeed and tend to nag at them with answers I believe are correct for them.  Now I'm trying the let them do them approach, where I try to stay hands off in what they do, and just be there as support for them when they fall.  Some things are best left learned on their own and I have to be ok with not being in control of their lives.  Probably will be useful for when I have kids someday.\n\nWhat do you feel is a common reoccurring issue you have that you want to break out of?
2	I keep having no money so now I splurge on my diversified stock portfolio
0	Looking for enfj certification	Anyone have a link to the enfj society social club? I need to get enfj certified so people believe my thoughts and feelings. Apparently, other enfj consider me being upset and stressed as a sign of not being an enfj. So i decided to partake in your cultist underground enfj initiation rights so i can get certified as an enfj
6	What are you saying? I don’t understand what you’re on about from saying “certification” to saying that you have to prove yourself to be an ENFJ. \n\nYou’re taking this way too seriously and it’s sad that you’re getting offended by random people on the internet about something trivial. 
2	i'm going to lock this thread as it's not really being productive. please be respectful of your discussions.  The people of this thread have been warned, multiple offenses will result in further action.  Ya'll don't need to agree, but be civil. /u/totallykvothe
1	Uhmm you should be able to fake any test to give you a desired result on these. So I dont really see how anyone could be 'certified'.\n\nHow about a little background on what's going on here. Who are these 'other' enfjs? What is their basis in saying you are not enfj? Also what quizzes have you tried to determine if you are enfj? Were you honest with yourself on those quizes?\n\n\nThe Myers-Briggs is an attempt to break people into 16 different categories. Often this is done through subjective questions which rank some of the functions against each other. For instance you may gain energy from a social situation (E) or you may feel drained by it (I). Though I'm sure there are some situations where some people feel either or. Often in the personality community they label this with an x. Truly though everyone probably has more of a meter between each function. Truly people should probably talk more about how heavily each of these are rated. People are undoubtedly more complex than even this though so in the first place this system should be taken with a grain of salt. \n\nP.S.  i do still think some of the trends are there. Personally I identify with the emotional hypochondria and personality/value mirroring a lot of enfjs report. 
4	anyone want to chat to a broken crazy lunatic enfj	before i do something stupid
6	I wish you well and I hope that you find all that you need. I believe that there is more for you in life. Thank you for sharing.
4	I don't mean to sound rough but maybe you should talk to a therapist?\nIt sounds like you're going through a lot and it might do you good with some weight of your shoulders.
2	What would happen to make you feel that way? I’m sorry to hear. 
2	I have experienced the brokenness of life too. There is most certainly an up from here. I hate to see it when others go through it. 
2	Do you believe that you have the choice to change the aggression that you take out on others? To grow? To improve?
2	I’m sure all enfjs have felt broken, crazy and lunacy.  It can be rough out there for our caring hearts.  Sometimes flipping the script and  becoming  closed off and cold happens as a result and can lead to using our traits for evil.  Been there. Done that.  Too much energy for little result, tbh.  Higher yields of results when you do the work to make yourself the best you.  
1	Why do you think you are a crazy lunatic?
1	You have a unique personality being an enfj and, therefore can have many positive impacts in the world. I have lived life feeling like I have had a target on my back as well. I wouldn’t go to a fortune teller. I would not think that you are crazy at all either. I also know the rejection that can come with being misunderstood. 
1	We never have to go at life alone. Sometimes, we can just chose the wrong ones in life to go at it with. 
1	What are the hints of it being your fault?
1	So what would/could you change?
1	Sure text me anytime lol 
1	When i google enfj under stress i realised i wasnt a lunatic at all\nXx
1	Equally psyched out crazy ENxP here, I just came to the crushing realization the old me died a long time ago hahaha. I'm literally nothing because I have destroyed myself :D\n\nFeel free to text me because I'm equally miserable and boy oh boy, misery loves company :')
7	Am I an ENFJ?	Hey guys! I have been assuming myself as an ENFP until recently I had doubts about my personality type so I took several MBTI tests in different sites to verify my type. I have got ENFP from 16personalities.com , ENTJ from another site and ESFJ from the last site. From these 3 results, I conclude my own type by finding the common traits which are E, N, F and J. Am I rly an ENFJ?
11	I highly suggest you take the cognitive functions test. That tells you exactly! Sorry that I’m not giving you a definite answer, but I think that test might help! 
7	I agree with kaia2. Look at the functions for ENFP and ENFJ and go from there. I thought I was ENFP for a good while until I started looking into MBTI functions and it became clear to me that I mistyped myself.\nHere's a good place to start:\nhttp://www.cognitiveprocesses.com/16Types/ENFJ.cfm
3	I recommend you to watch davesuperpowers on YouTube, i used to think i was an entj before that. Thats because the test usually doesn't work.
7	How good are ENFJs with communicating?	Hi everybody INFP here who just wants to understand his ENFJ friend a little better and wants to relieve his insecurities a bit. How good are you guys with communication? Are you consistent? Me and my friend (who's a girl) have been LD friends for years now but she recently started her first year of uni. Up until when she entered uni, we were having conversations frequently. The longest we'd ever gone without exchanging a text over the last 3 years was a week. Nowadays the few times we do text, the conversation is rather short and ends abruptly because she just stops answering. I'm already in my 2nd year of college, so I understand her being too busy with her new lifestyle to text me as frquently as she used to, but I still get insecure about her just forgetting about me, losing interesting in keeping up with me, and then eventually replacing me with some other friends who actually live in her country. I also try my best to text at least once a week just to check in on her, but I feel like I'm being overbearing, so I'm considering stopping and letting her have some space. And I'll repeat that I [I]know[/I] she just got into university less than 2 months ago, but I can't help feeling neglected in spite of that, as selfish as that sounds. But I'm dealing with it the best I can, and I wou;;dn't want to mentally burden her by telling her any of this because I know that would make her feel like shit. Our friendship means too much to me.\n\nBut I'll add that she's aware that she hasn't been great at getting back to me. Every time she has gotten back to me, she has been apologetic for not being better at it. And I definitely appriciate it.\n\nI know that what I'm worried about is silly and I should probably stop being so insecure about my relationship with somebody a whole ocean away, but again, I can't help it.\n\nBut are a lot of ENFJs like this? Do you get so busy you end up neglecting your friends? Should I continue checking in on her weekly/bi-weekly or is that an annoyingly bad idea?
12	I appreciate when people check in on me. I usually will swamp myself with my own work and thoughts and don’t like asking for help but like it when other people will reach out. \n\nI tend to downplay how things are going with me to not make anyone worry and like to focus the conversation on them. But I am very happy to receive a message from someone because they were thinking about me. 
8	I'm guilty of totally forgetting to reply or reach out. There are always so many things in my head... Sometimes I stop and realize I haven't heard from someone in a month or so and run to text them. If she apologizes it probably means that she is overwhelmed and still trying to find a balance. 
4	Nah I keep in touch with my friends if they reach out.  Maybe occasionally I'd miss a text.  But when you're in college, lots of things go on and I know it gets overwhelming trying to attend all the fun activities out there.  So I can see why she forgets to keep in touch.
4	I’m an ENFJ and I would say communication is one of my best strengths. However, I was not born with this ability. Yes, I am a very sociable individual, and that helps.  However, communication skills have to be worked and practiced, and good communication is *intentional.* I don’t think just because someone is extroverted or has a specific personality type does not necessarily mean they are going to be a good communicator. 
2	**I am not an ENFJ**\n\n>But are a lot of ENFJs like this? Do you get so busy you end up neglecting your friends?\n\n*Yes.*\n\nThis is one of the struggles for an ENFJ, one of their primal struggles they will never get rid of no matter what they are doing.  They can get better at it (but never rid of this struggle) and the way to get better at it is being mindful but also some habits that helps them re-center.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is because ENFJs have a duality with their feeling, there are two different sides of feeling and these both different sides have a duality.\n\nOne side of Feeling for an ENFJ is Fe and they have a ***Leading*** nature to this Fe, they can always do more after all.  At the same time this Fe in an ENFJ is their ***Base*** and it is their ***Dominant Instinct***.\n\nBut there is another part of an ENFJ that is their Fi, it is part of their shadow and they engage it less often and they engage it all the time but it is done in a reflex / reactive way (not a conscious proactive way.)  The Fi has an ***Ignoring*** and ***Observing*** quality, a duality here like the double side of a coin.  Sometimes the ENFJ is observing their Fi and is hyper aware of it, and they can write BOOKS on the subject of the importance of Fi. (ENFJs are some of the best teachers of the importance of Fi)\n\nYet at other times ^(in the exact same person) the ENFJ *ignores* their Fi, not because they like to ignore their Fi, but because all things requires sacrifices and a *ordering of priorities* and an ENFJ sometimes de-escalates all the numerous Fi goals they have because an ENFJs love and caring and goals and dreams and aspirations are endless...yet their reach, aka what they can do with their hands is not endless and thus you have to choose, you organize, and you prioritizes.  And an ENFJ tries their best but they are also perfectionist critics (at least on their own self, onto other people ENFJs are hit and miss with their perfectionist streak) and sometimes they feel they do not did the best with this organization.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNote an INFP has the same tension for they also lead  / base / dominant with Fi and have Fe as ignoring / observing trait.  So in many ways you gals and guys are so similar.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo does your ENFJ like this?  I can't tell.  Many ENFJs like this form of attention, this ritual and it makes them feel valued *if the person who is doing it is important to them, and also it does not have too much baggage / obligation / duty.*\n\n\nBut if everyone did this to an ENFJ it would drive them crazy =P\n\nSo you have to figure out and ask the ENFJ if they like this.  And if they say no, do not take it personally ***for it is not about you / *** *nor does it say anything about your relationship with the ENFJ*.  Instead it merely tells you how occupied the ENFJ is and how over extended they are (or under extended.)\n\nOh yeah even if your ENFJ loves this attention and it helps recharge them and feels like they did something meaningful.  Sometimes giving them this attention actually causes them to lash out for it is not about you (again), but is instead the ENFJ is negotiating their boundaries with other people and they already were super sensitive, and just a reminder they were super sensitive causes them to explode for it was the straw with the camel back.  There is always an ENFJ around Christmas time who loves Christmas and loves to help people, only to over-promise and not compartmentalize some things, and be aware of their physical and emotional needs, and suddenly something is not perfect or the ENFJ overextends and then it all comes crashing down.  Things are said, **things are projected,** and it is all nonsense, but it hurts like hell when it occurs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI would welcome feedback on this post from the ENFJs and also the other people.
1	There comes a point when it becomes more effort to keep in regular contact with someone than it's worth to me. So, if/when that point comes, and if the other person seems to be doing well without me, I stop deliberately reaching out. This can be a temporary state, like if I'm really busy, melancholy, or stressed out, or it could be permanent, like if I've tried too many times and gotten the feeling that I'm unwelcome.\n\nI feel bad when I miss getting back to someone if they reach out to me, but that happens quite often too, honestly. It doesn't lessen my appreciation for the attention though.
1	As a trainer, I tend to believe that I'm good with communicating with others in order to be impactful and effective in my role. However, it's important not to be not to be smug, for it will prevent further improvement. I'm always on a quest to discover my weaknesses and keen to learn more about myself and others.
19	if everybody would stop being so negative. that would be such a cool world.	like i only function wit positive peeps.\n\nand its so hard when you leave high school.\n\nevery circle feels bleh.
8	It's called Canada.
3	u got to have the ups with the downs buddy. u can't always have that emotional high forever, else you won't grow as a person
2	Cardiff is good
2	I never felt social in high school. Just had my little group of 3 or 4 people and that was good. Now, after school its still just is, with each in addition dating someone thats like a mini me.\n\n
2	true. i wish i’d know how to show those people and make them understand. I’ll spend my entire life getting better and better at that.\n\n👏make👏the world👏 a better 👏place 
10	Showing appreciation for an ENFJ?	I've been working with an ENFJ recently at an office job and I wanted to give him a small gift before he leaves in about another week or so. He had been so helpful and patient while showing me the steps, that it truly made me realize just how hard I am on myself lol I wish I wasn't so anxious and more confident to express myself and socialize better with him than how it has currently been going, but I'm still working on it! He is truly amazing and comes from a nice family, who's father I really admire, and I have no doubt that he'll be going in the same direction. We're the same age, but we definitely come from different backgrounds and circumstances... \n\nSo, what I wanted to ask was what kind of gifts do ENFJ's like to receive?\n\nI haven't known this one for long, but I think having a small gesture would be nice to give anyway... 
13	As an ENFJ guy, I like to give handwritten cards that show how glad I am to know them. I know that’s what would make me very happy and I have seen that those I have given it to have been very grateful for them.\n\nI would love getting something that reminds me of that person as well. Just something small - maybe referencing an inside joke, an object that represents how I feel about them, something homecooked that I can share with them, etc. As long as it’s genuine, that’s all that matters to me. 
3	Think about who the person is and think about something he may need.  I'm an ENFJ and my best friend in hs was too.  He came from a poorer family, so I'd often pay attention to what stationary he had (as school was very important to him).  When his pencils were running low I knew a good gift would be a box of them.  When he lost his ruler, I got him a new one.  Etc.  Think about what he likes and get him a small gift which can enhance his ability to do it.  Remember that a small, thoughtful gift is better than a large one that you didn't put thought into.  If all else fails, make him a card (I say make it because it shows you spent effort into giving him something.  That's a big thing for ENFJ's)
3	I added a posting to the relationship subreddit	Hey trying to get some input from you guys. Please know that it is relationship related so if you have read my posts and have gotten annoyed from them i made it easier so you won’t have to read it on here. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/mbtirelationships/comments/9vqco4/enfj_s_i_have_a_question/?st=JOAS60D8&sh=8f669de7
7	Can we become sadists or is it me?	To avoid getting this post removed, please do no talk about advices for this is not a therapy session 
7	It all depends on your intentions. I feel like it's totally plausible since enfj's have very likable personalities (at least on the face of it) and once you have formed a bond with someone what you do with it is up to you. Toxic enfj's will seek to manipulate for their own pleasure (sadism), while more mature enfj's will seek to improve the other and the relationship.
4	This guy definitely thinks so but the cruelty is in a  certain sense. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/9vn7zVi7wMU\n\nI don't think you'd find an ENFJ torturing puppies. An ENFJ is all about retributive justice and correcting wrongs. They aren't always even handed in their application of it so if they don't watch out they could end up causing damage disproportionate to the initial wrong.\n
2	yes ofc anyone can\n\nENFJs can be effective manipulators
7	Personality types and underwear types? (x-post /r/mbti)	Hello there.\n\nI did a bit of research on that topic, but didn't find anything meaningful (searched through google scholar).\n\nI was wondering if I could find correlation (and perhaps causation) from psychological types to the type of underwear worn.\n\nHere's the [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Q0O9FFHmOZKay1ztg9g39iEsP9gjGIYwejsnFrjGZ9Y/edit).\n\nFeel  free to comment on those questions aswell (with your MBTI type  identified) if you want. I figured this sort of survey would be okay  since there was a fetish survey a week ago on [/r/MBTI](https://www.reddit.com/r/MBTI). Hope it's alright
2	done! i’m interested in what the results would be!
1	Did it in the name of science. BTW, it would be nice if you could have separate charts for what women and men wear 
1	yeah, probably because there’s so many more types of underwear for women rather than men, but still interesting! and you’re welcome! (:
1	I find it funny that, because of underwear, it's NSFW, lol.
13	No purpose.	Do you guys also feel like you wanne die of boredom sometimes. Me and my friends are writing exam now, but I ontly have one test left and I'm done studying for it. Everyone else on the other hand is so fucking busy no one has time to talk or anything. I try entertaining myself, I draw a lot, make some music, watch some series, go on walks. But I can only do so much of these things. I'd rather study as well, thing is theses nothing to study at the moment. I learn new things by nyself though, read articles etc. But now I've increasingly become more and more alone. I get ny energy from people and now there's no one around. What should I do? I hate waiting for the day to just pass. I want to enjoy my days.
3	Try to watch The office or Gintama, these two shows tend to make me feel less lonely or just help me pass time quickly.
2	I can 100% relate. My friends are all super busy with their exams right now and it’ll be like this till summer. I used to be in the same program as them but I changed my major and it’s less intensive class wise so I’m usually done with things quickly. Never did I think I would be bored of being bored but it’s gotten to that point. \n\nI’ve watched shows, listened to music, spent hours whiling away watching YouTube videos, video edited, and tried to rekindle old hobbies. None of it really does it for me. I try to workout regularly though and that does get me satisfied. However, I’ve seen that it’s only when I’m with my friends that I get more excitement and rejuvenation than any of the other activities combined.\n\nI don’t have too much advice because I’m trying to get through it as well. But I did start learning languages again through things like DuoLingo and consuming media so I’m glad my mind is stimulated in that way. I also have seen that having music in the background helps and I don’t know if others do this, but talking to myself gets me energized and keeps my thoughts straight
17	Surrounded by Sensors...	First off, I need to say two things.... the first being that I’m married to a Sensor (ISTP) and have no complaints - 12 years and going strong. The second being that I don’t buy in to the whole N is better than S thing that’s so commonly brought up in the MBTI world. I admit at one time I did feel that way... but that was before I realized that all the types contribute something different and essential. \n\n\nMoving on to the question... :) \n\n\nAt any one time in my life, I have always had at least two close friends who were Ns. This has recently changed... and I’m finding myself with close friends who are all S types. I’m starting to feel like my conversations are different.... and for lack of better words... like I’m losing a part of myself. That’s the only way I can describe it.... such a weird feeling. \n\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Curious to know....
2	36f.   I am also with an istp!  I find him to be grounding.   My mother whom I adore is an istj, but her twin brother is an INTJ.  I am convinced that n in her life from her twin helped her to understand me better.  However,  she stifled my n and f as a child in some ways.: ( discouraging me from worrying so much about fe and ni and really trying to get me to use ti , which is our weakest point).  \nWith that said the majority of my coworkers are s. However,  I am closest to the ns.  I form outside of work friendships with the ns typically.  \nIn real life,  all of my closest friends are Infj .  Not on purpose.  Just worked out that way.  I met them all in college and now we live so far apart.  It can be hard but we try to connect via phone once or twice a week.  \n
4	We all have different types of friends whom we have different conversations with. I don’t often get into deep conversations about politics or about the future with many sensor friends, but I still enjoy the conversation. It’s often more lighthearted and fun, or we talk about issues they’re facing now, and I‘m happy to be a part of those conversations too.
3	I’m ENFJ and i dont relate. \n\nI wonder if thats a maturing thing or in other words something that changes with time and life experience. \n\nHow old are you if i may ask? I’m 36 male. I feel like in my 30s i’m significantly more open to other types than i was in my 20s, purely based on maturity. I hope that in my 40s i have reached the maturity to understand the Sensors ;)
1	I have a thought that you might relate to.\nI need to feel before I think, so I derive thoughts from feelings. If I'm with people, I can feel more easily, so specific groups of people would produce particular feelings--which leads to particular thoughts. If that makes sense for you...\n\nThen the type of feelings = thoughts you get from socialising with the S types could mean=\nYou are building your identity from your thoughts \nSo you may experience a shift in identity/mentality \n\nOr simply put, "you are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with" :)
1	I’m married to an ISTP too! Being married to an almost opposite is really interesting and fun but a little draining at times. I’d like to hear your story... with that said... I’m surrounded by S types as well and I definitely feel like something is missing. I have much deeper bonds with Ns and never feel that my relationship as a friend is a priority to S’s. More so that it’s a “ what’s in it for them” situation. It’s unfortunate and I don’t want to not like them for that reason... it’s just a little disappointing when you’re trying to make friends
10	Helping people in abusive friend/relationships	So a topic that caught my eye from the INFP reddit.  For this it was about addressing [bullying]( https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/9udgb8/being_bullied/).  I wanted to share something with some ENFJs that may have friends who might be bullied or in a toxic relationship.\n\n\nFrom my experience, some people tend to hate confrontation and because of this, they tend to be taken advantage of by others or bullied.  Sometimes, being bullied may not be apparent or obvious to the person on the receiving end of this.  Due to this, I believe some people in general may have difficulty setting boundaries with other people (friends or whatever) and end up seeing a toxic relationship as a normal one.  Something like Stockholm syndrome.\n\n\nSo my friend has this thing where if someone is able to gain their trust, that trust is going to be extremely difficult to break.  So what started off as a regular friendship ended up becoming somewhat toxic some years later.  This friend didn’t really see it as being toxic at all at the time and often fell back on the “happy times” they had in their younger years. It wasn’t until I met the toxic friend that I started seeing signs that indicated how unhealthy their relationship was.  In general, Friend was essentially becoming the Toxic’s emotional punching bag to be used for unproductive venting sessions about their problems that they don’t want to fix or are trying to fix using methods that are clearly failing.  Friend’s time was being wasted on these sessions and if Toxic’s mood is shot, they would emotionally push Friend around.\n\n\nFriend was in a tough spot where they felt that their friendship with Toxic was so important as they’ve built it up over the course of years.  Toxic was pretty entitled as well to Friend’s time and things.  Every time I hung out with them, I saw that Toxic was basically being taken care of by Friend.  I couldn’t really let this stand by and urged Friend to stand their ground and set boundaries.  However, every time Friend would confront Toxic about an issue, Toxic would go into a fit and then follow it by a dramatic apology.  “I’ll never do it again”, “I’ll be better about it next time, “I didn’t mean it.”  As one can see, these are empty apologies and then Toxic would fall back into the same old bad habits again.\n\n\nEvery time I would talk to Friend about these issues, they would assure me that the friendship they had with Toxic was too important to them and they’ve been through too much together to give it all up.  I eventually asked Friend, what about Toxic TODAY would make them a good friend?  Following up with questions in regards to deeds they’ve done for friend, moments when they were there for Friend, and whether they’d help Friend in a sticky situation.  Friend thought about it and responded with how they weren’t really sure they could remember the last time Toxic was a decent friend to them.  I would continue to ask these questions whenever Friend would vent about Toxic.  Eventually, they started realizing that the relationship they had with Toxic was entirely a Take relationship.  This took a very long time for Friend to realize that people sometimes outgrow each other.\n\n\nIt took a lot of patience and support to help said friend out of the bad relationship. At first I was met with extreme resistance and had plenty of arguments in regards to the issue to the point where both my friend and I thought we would stop being friends.  However, with enough support, my friend was able to get out of that situation.  It wasn’t until some time later, they look back and see how bad Toxic was.  They couldn’t believe that they put up with Toxic for years.  Now they kinda realize how traumatic the experience was and was extremely thankful that I was willing to push them to stand up for themselves.\n\n\nIf you see something that doesn’t seem right, whether it’s emotional abuse/manipulation or if someone clearly looks uncomfortable, please do what you can to provide enough emotional support to help your friends out of that situation.   My friend really did not want me to confront Toxic directly (boy that did kill me).  I believe that because I was able to urge/push my friend to stand up for themselves, they began developing their boundaries that allowed them to simply say “no” when they felt like it.  \n\nThe friend didn’t just have confrontational issues with Toxic, it also occurred with some random stranger that kept badgering Friend why they didn’t call them back (as they were romantically interested in them).  It was while we were at a party (while Friend was still friends with Toxic, but Toxic wasn’t with us at the time).  Some person would continue following Friend around asking the same question. I urged Friend to just tell them they weren’t interested and for the person to leave them alone.  Friend didn’t want to ruin the party or disturb the peace.  I responded with “do you want to spend the next few hours having to interact with this person, or do you want to enjoy the party after one firm outburst?”  Friend made their choice and told off the person, then they were left alone for the rest of the party.\n\n\nWhat I learned from all this is :\n\n\n- that toxic relationships don’t instantly happen, they sort of creep on you and the longer you have that toxic relationship with someone, the harder it is to get out of it.\n\n\n\n- People who are in such situations don’t need to be romantically involved with someone\n\n- People may not realize the relationship they have with someone is toxic\n\n\n- People who can’t help themselves, tend to play victim and blame their issues on other people, even the person they are emotionally taking advantage of. \n\n\n- It might take some time to gather up courage to confront someone, so the best thing to do for those not involved directly with the situation, is to provide the person with plenty of validation and affirmation.  Eventually the person will gather enough courage to stand up for themselves. (As this is effective for boosting self-confidence)\n\n\n- If it’s a choice between disturbing the peace and your own emotional well being, I believe standing up for yourself outweighs whatever "peace” the group has.  You shouldn’t have to sacrifice yourself to that extent for the sake of others.  If your friends truly care about you, they’d understand that you’re not just complaining about a person.  They would understand that you’re legitimately being stepped on by the bully.\n\n\n- Problems don’t magically go away, if they aren’t addressed, they’ll grow/fester into bigger problems.  Or you could just move to another city and hope the same situation doesn’t happen again, but that uprooting is really unnecessary as long as you address the issue.  I know there’s a saying “you must learn to pick and choose your battles”, but there are some battles you must not run away from.\n\n\n\n
2	Excellent post. ENFJs have such good insight into people’s bad intentions that it’s a real advantage to yourselves and your loved ones. Thanks for caring so much. 
18	When you’re in a new social situation you’ve never encountered, do you tend to be awkward and weird?	
8	yeah but the older I get the less so. when I was 15 I was invited to a party and sat alone in a corner for 15 minutes. 18 now and I had a decent time a few weeks ago in a group of people where I only knew one person. 
7	Yes, and and any advice that may come from this, I would also love to peruse. I think I have a tendency to overthink my interactions, not trying to come across as awkward...and end up coming across as awkward. That and my fear of being rejected or having a bad social interaction makes it hard to have good conversations and interactions initially.\n\nI'm trying to be better friends with my neighbors, and I'm currently doing everything except actually going for it. I'm asking my friends what to do, how to text them, WHEN to text them when I should just do it. I was able to hang out with them just twicw and I was a little tipsy both times. I want to have good conversations with new(er) people without my own brain getting in my way. And it's gotten worse, not better, as time goes on.
3	I think I’m shy by nature, but somehow I’m a very social guy. I think it comes from just pushing yourself out there enough that you become somewhat comfortable with being exposed to potentially akward situations.
1	Yes
1	My experience has been as long as I have one 'foundation' person I'm comfortable with, even if I am not talking to them specifically at the party or whatever, I can do pretty well. I need 1 reliable person to pull some comfort from to excel in these sorts of spaces. 
32	Difficulty with distinguising relationships	Hi all!\n\nFor the most part, as an ENFJ, we tend to get along with most people - we find commonalities and when we're comfortable, we are warm and talkative... And sometimes people get the wrong idea (that we like them as more than friends). But how do you all find your person if we generally get along with most people? I think I have the tendency to kinda fall for whoever likes me when I'm single and because I don't like conflict and end up liking them, I chameleon to them. Or at least I think I do? \n\nHalp...
9	You'll find someone that compliments your personality very well. It's not just about getting along, its about balancing each other out and complimenting each other's strengths and weaknesses. Also, when you find your person you'll just know man. My parents always told me this but I never understood until I really fell inlove!\n\nGood luck 
4	Well if you're just starting out, you probably don't know what you want in a partner.  It takes a few failed relationships before you realize what traits you like and dislike.  Once you figure that out, then you'll know when you'll sincerely fall for the right person.  Dating is experimenting with people and figuring out compatibility.  So it'll take you some time before you can distinguish true love.  \n\nI personally dated whoever liked me first as well, after a while, I learned how to filter out the type of people I know I'm not compatibile with.
5	I agree with the other comment that when you meet the right person you will know... can totally testify to that. It’s a completely different feeling... and at the foundation is just tranquility, if that makes any sense lol :) \n\n\nAlso to add to that, for me it was finally finding someone who took the time to really try to take care of me. Since we ENFJs are always looking outward to assist others with their needs, ours can kind of go on the back burner. My husband was the first person to consistently try to get my feelings and comfort level off that back burner and make them a priority. \n\n\nHope that helps in some way! :) 
3	In my experience, it's the person that I've been friends with the longest that I get along with the most, am most comfortable around, and generally "click with" that I see as a romantic partner.
3	Yep. I agree. I tend to go for whoever went for me. Bad strategy. Need to fix it 
2	You'll find someone that compliments your personality very well. It's not just about getting along, its about balancing each other out and complimenting each other's strengths and weaknesses. Also, when you find your person you'll just know man. My parents always told me this but I never understood until I really fell inlove!\n\nGood luck 
1	Have you spent any decent amount of time single? 
1	Yes, you are right that we can get along well with most people. Unless that person is a narcissistic or toxic person, I  always have a way to work through them using empathy and rapport building. I think it is important to seek out for your soulmate when it comes to a relationship, I’m sure you do not want an average, boring relationship right? A soulmate will be able to connect with us so deep inside that it transcends through this physical realm.
15	Sometimes I think too much	Sometimes I think too much and go into a negative spiral. Does this happen to you guys and how do you get out of it? 
2	I use the word cancel. It works.
3	Yeah sometimes. I usually overthink something some one I care about says or doesn't say. Or when something is bothering them ans they don't open up (I know its fine keeping stuff to yourself but I feel like for an ENFJ its harder ti accept). So then I blow it up in my head and I get sad... \n\nWhat I do is I try to stay busy with stuff that demands my attention.
3	It's an Ni-Ti loop. Best way is to engage Fe and actually talk to someone. Tell them what you're looping about and they will give you feedback which will help your inf Ti :)
21	Picky with friends?	Hello fellow ENFJs,\n\nI was just wondering how other enfjs are with friendships because, although I'm really social and find it easy to get along with all types of people, I barely have any good friends. I have a lot of acquaintances and some people I hang out with at college, but the spark of friendship is just not there. I feel the ideal friend is someone I can completely be myself around, unfiltered, and I just haven't found that yet. \n\nIf you have any similar experiences or advice I'd love to hear it, thank you.
9	I think our standards (from a moral perspective) might be too high. I have several of the same issues as you are describing. There may also be a certain pessimistic streak. I tend to attract people who are very competitive with me when all I want to do is love them. 😭
7	I’m also picky with friends and because of this, it has been extremely hard for me to find close friends, but I’ve still managed to make a few.
5	Same here man, I find it super easy to get along with most people but I only have one friend that I actually enjoy having over and I can be completely myself around him. I make friends at work and end up just talking to them while we’re working. I was close with 3-4 people at my last job but now that I’m not forced to see them everyday I choose not to hangout i feel like an asshole because they’ll text me ever so often and ask me to hangout and I just never respond. \n\nAlso an ENFJ 
6	Recently found out my close friends are all NF types and I love them dearly, if you can find other idealists you should be good 
4	I have several very good friends. Most of these friends were people I've spent a LOT of time with. With all of them I was the one who initiated the friendship. Each and every single one. I used to get upset that people wouldn't be the ones calling me out but I've since just accepted that I'm far more social than most of the people I known.\n\nIn my opinion time is the only thing required to make a good friend. Past that the person just needs to be someone you can hang out with. My only requirements for that are that they're nice and they're willing to do things with me or talk with me. \n\nNotably making an adult Friend is pretty hard but mostly because of the time part. Most of my very good friends are from college. My wife is also introverted so that has changed my social dynamic. 
3	I do agree I am picky with friends. I would say I have 6 good friends and 3 who I am especially close with. I believe friends are a reflection of yourself so being picky is a good thing. But it shouldn’t hinder you and make you judgmental. It’s an organic process so when you enjoy someone’s company and can appreciate each other, it makes for a good friend 
2	Completley relate to this. I desire to be close to people but yea.. I guess I’m picky even though I don’t necessarily think my standards are all that high? Maybe people with substance are a harder thing to come by lol! But it’s pretty easy for me to get along with anyone and i have a lot of different friends in different friend groups but to be a part of a group of all really friends where we connect on a more deeper level is more challenging for me to find. Even with one person, I feel as though the relationship eventually fizzles out and/or I cannot fully express myself and be more intimate with that person due to lack of empathy or lack of reciprocal communication.
14	How do you not be all in when meeting someone new you like?	How do you not completely drop what you do and gush them with attention, to the point where it could come off as needy?\n\nAsking as a male ENFJ.
5	I think it's important to be honest about your communication style. I am very upfront about being a physically affectionate person but also that I understand space. If they are comfortable to tell me when it's too much, then I worry less about just being myself. 
4	Honestly, I think if you accept yourself you tend to attract people who accept you the way you are. 
3	Because that always ends badly
3	If they don't like it they should tell us they don't like it! XD \nAgain, my crush in an introvert...so they don't mind the attention. They would mostly ignore me, but reply when they want to. \nMaybe this is not an 'ideal' situation, but our personalities compels us act in extreme ways. \nENFJs are either all in or not at all so...the solution is to find someone who can handle that ahaha! If they don't like it, maybe move on? 
2	I’m right there with you!
2	Fe>Ni=Ne>Si>Ti>Fi>Te>Se: Am I an ENFJ	My functions stack is Fe>Ni=Ne>Si>Ti>Fi>Te>Se. What is my MBTI type? According to 16 personalities and human metrics I am an INFJ. \n\nWhat do you think?\n\n&#x200B;
5	Where did you get this result like that? I’d like to take that test too. \n\n\n( the Fe>Ni =Ne >Se .... business)
5	The most solid part of the mbti types is the introversion vs. extroversion. Do you feel energized after hanging out and talking with people? Even strangers? Or do you feel drained?
1	You are either ENFJ or INFJ depending on how extraverted you think you are
1	Don't take personality tests.\n\nCheck out the sidebar on r/mbti. This is the link for ENFJ and its breakdown into functions:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/2f9pe4/socionicsmbti_descriptions_by_functions_enfj/\n\n
45	ENFJs and "Mothering"	Just curious if anyone else experiences this. It seems that no matter what, every friend group I've been apart of, I'm always "Squad Mom".\n\nWhen we go out drinking I'm the one making sure everyone's eaten beforehand, swiping phones when they start drunk dialing, holding back hair, watching drinks, pushing water, arranging transportation back. Not because I'm DD, but because even while drinking I'm always aware of these things.\n\nWe go to the river, I'm the one with sunscreen and extra waters. We go traveling, I have the map, snacks and a portable charger. \n\nA few times a week I have friends over to my barrack and cook for them. I'm always the one they call to ask about [insert medical condition]. Or to confide in or ask advice. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not complaining about any of these things; I genuinly enjoy helping everyone and it just feels natural to do all of this. I'm just wondering if any of you have experienced the designated "Squad Mom" effect too.
26	As a male ENFJ, I am very much the same way. I am always taking care of my friends, being the responsible one in anything we do. I try to be the voice of reason, try to make sure everyone is having a good time, and that there is no drama. When we go on road trips I always pack things that I assume my dumb friends probably forgot. I like to be the one that drives everywhere because I trust myself more than them. My friends also lean on mean to be the responsible one. I see myself that way, but so do they.
9	✋🏽✋🏽✋🏽 sometimes i can’t tell if i’m overbearing and become obsessed with making sure everyone is comfortable and well appointed and then i become overbearing again and it’s just a vicious cycle 
5	ALWAYS!!!\n\nIt doesn't help that I am a freelance chef/baker. Everyone wants to come to my apartment for food or asks me to make shit. Hah
6	Yes I always tell people I’m a mom first person 
5	Had a coworker tell me I'm a suburban mom because I brought her soup for being sick. Am a 30s year old white male .--. 
3	PREACH MOMMA!
4	same, not a mom per se, but I usually drive my friends home even if they're out of the way. I also tend to have things that people need out of the blue, like an extra battery for charging a phone, pens (why don't people just have one in their bag?), tissues, lozenges, you name it. 
3	Yes, this is me. I've hated that I am like this for years... but now I've just come to accept it, and try to dial it back a little bit. I know sometimes it can come off condescending or annoying.
5	Wow, I could have written this! It’s to the point where my friends don’t concern themselves because they know I have things handled. It used to bother me, that no one else seemed to care, but I came to the conclusion that no one could care more than I do, so I have accepted my role LOL 🤪
5	When going out, I'm definitely the "mom friend". Even during my own bachelorette I took care of the other girls, made sure they didn't go to hotels with strange boys, told them it was time to go home, ordered a round of non-alcoholic drinks for everyone in the middle. We had a whole hockey team hitting on us in that bar, so we had to leave before everyone got stupid. The girls crashed at my place and i made sure everyone drank water before they went to sleep. They still talk about how it was such a great night out and how nobody got stupid :')
4	It is a common trait associated with ENFJs, sometimes to the point of a sterotype that is taken to extremes that are absurd.\n\nExcept I would not call it "mothering" I would instead call it being a "big sister."  I see it as a more older child thing even if you are not technically the oldest, you are not related to the other people, and sometimes you are even younger than your social peers.
3	As a guy, same here
2	I distinctly remember this time when I was staying with a good friend and my friend was at a magic the gathering meetup and I went to a soccer pickup game. Then we met back up to drive back home, and I asked him, "so did you have fun?" and he started laughing and accused me of sounding like a parent lol
16	Help with an ENFJ male?	So there's this guy at work who I'm pretty sure is an ENFJ. He just started a few months ago.  I thought he was attractive right away, but really didn't take much notice of him other than that. But then last week, we ended up having to drive somewhere together to pick something up for work. We got there and they told us it would be an hour wait. So we sit down and start talking. And we literally talk the entire time and are really connecting. Then finally it's time to head back to work (by this point, it's getting late, everyone else from the office had already left). We get in the car and our conversation keeps flowing and it's awesome. We both seem to find each other so interesting and have so much in common. In fact, we are so into our conversation, that we miss the exit that would have gotten us back to the office. We ended up driving 30 minutes past our work before either of us even noticed we had no idea where we were! So we sheepishly turn the car around and head back, but I didn't mind, because it just meant we got to spend more time talking.\n\nEver since then, it has seemed like he has really gone out of his way at work to stop by and chat with me and ask me about my life. He even remembers small details I mention.\n\nSkip ahead to today....when one of our coworkers mentions he has a girlfriend!\n\nDid I totally just misread an ENFJs friendliness for romantic interest? Do you guys connect with everyone that quickly? Isn't it weird that he hasn't mentioned he has a girlfriend to me??\n\nHaha thanks for letting me vent. I'm an INFP btw!
23	As an ENFJ male myself, everything you described him doing is something I could see myself doing. ENFJs enjoy conversation and we can talk for hours, especially when the other individual becomes comfortable around us. Because of this, some may take it for romantic interest but it’s really our interest in people.\n\nUsually when I’m romantically attracted to someone, I would compliment more and find moments to touch them. It's different from person to person but that’s how it is for me \n\nEDIT: Spelling
7	We looooooooove conversation. Especially stories. To a fault. \n\nAlso, and this may sound mean so I apologize in advance - a lot of people tend to read the type of intimacy we offer as romantic. I’ve seen this several times. It’s possible he’s also an assh@le. I’m not saying that’s out of the question.\n\nSorry you are in this situation! I’ve been there. 
7	Take things with a grain of salt.  But yea, ENFJs tend to be overfriendly and that can be misconstrued for romantic interest.  I can quickly click with someone depending on our common interests.  I've had conversations last hours with a bunch of my good friends (when we met).  It's not weird that he hasn't mentioned having a girlfriend to you, as that's his private business.    Although tbh, most ENFJs are pretty obvious about their significant others.  Maybe him having a girlfriend might not be a real thing and is probably speculation from the coworker.  In either case, I'd focus more on friendship so then you can manage expectations and not get disappointed in the long run.  Who knows, you're time may come in the future :P.
6	Having a girlfriend doesn't suddenly block the chemical receptors that allow for emotions akin to romantic attraction. Having a girlfriend is a logical, conscious commitment you make. But you're still human. So when you see someone you find attractive, when you get into a conversation with someone who you find charming, you still experience those same emotions. If you got the sense that he felt *some* sort of romantic attraction to you, I'm willing to bet he did. Just don't expect him to seriously act on those, further than having engaging conversations and good, innocent times at least, given he's a decent human being, of course.\n\nActually, the fact that he didn't mention a girlfriend makes it even more likely. Now whether that is "okay" is very much up for debate. I am leaning on the side of "no," though, but that's just me.
3	As an ENFJ (f) I can definitely say we’re very friendly. Maybe a little too friendly and people can get mixed signals all the time. We also love a  good story and love to listen. If given the chance we can talk forever and we do pick up on the little details. However, I don’t think you misread it. I definitely think you both were connecting. As for him having a gf that definitely does suck but it doesn’t hurt to ask. I rather have it confirmed personally than hear it through someone else. If you can’t date you can certainly be friends. Hope things work out well!
3	I think I see this with ENFJs overall than just the males. I'm currently in love with this ENFJ girl and we talked a lot and had amazing coversations and she was really friendly and sweet, but I did found out she had a boyfriend (she's been secret about it) and while I was heartbroken, it was no surprise that her flirtatious nature could just be that she just loves people and she definitely does.\n\nBTW, fellow xNFP here. I'm not great at reading people. I feel sorry for what you're going through since i'm going through the same as well.
2	Wow, I wish I could carry a conversation for more than 30 seconds.
2	Yeah, sorry about that. It's not you. It's him. (Us?) \n\nBut it kind of IS you, too. You connected with one of us! Very cool! Maybe he sees a friend in you. Is that enough for you? \n\nOR, he wants way more and will dump his gf and y'all will drive all over the world together forgetting your turns and blowing through small towns, all because you're lost in conversation. 
3	Thoughts on ESTJ x ENFJ relationships?	Hey fellow ENFJs! Just interested in your personal experiences with ESTJs. Based on our cognitive functions, what possible pros/cons or issues/complements would you guess for this combination? Would love to hear from you guys!
1	I like ESTJs. They can be serious and intimidating to people, but when I’m alone with one their silly side comes out. They are funny and really care about their loved ones.
1	ENFJs and their depictions in media	So I was talking with my ENFJ gf and she mentioned that she's grown tired with ENFJ protagonists. She says she's seen it so many times that she's gotten bored with it.\n\nWhat do you guys think about it? Are there a lot of ENFJ protagonists? Is it a bad thing that they are or aren't? Is it possible that media has done ENFJs dirty and hasn't done them correctly or with depth?\n\n
12	Personally, I haven't seen that many ENFJ protagonists but this might be due to the type of story I read/watch. However, I do think that a lot of protagonists out there exhibit stereotypical ENFJ qualities e.g. altruism but cognitive process-wise, they are definitely not ENFJs
10	I think people get ENFJs wrong a lot: focusing only on them just being “do-gooders” instead of having complexity. \n\nThat said, I actually feel like I have trouble finding ENFJ depictions in the media. Drama rarely sells with a character who feels the emotions of those around them. 
4	Who would be an example of this?
4	It’s not just heroes, either. There’s a good case to be made for Kylo Ren being an ENFJ.
3	As an INTP it can be hard to find characters that I identify with and I told my gf. She mentioned having the opposite problem. I can kind of see why though. INTPs aren't exactly the most compelling characters. \n\nDo ENFJs just have what it takes to be a main character naturally? 
1	Jess from New Girl
1	I think the problem with ENFJ characters is that they are either these absolute perfect saviors or these chilling manipulative villains, no in between. The only balanced ENFJs I can remember are Remus Lupin and Emma Woodhouse.
5	I am an INTP	What do you guys think of us? I have seen alot of ENFJs on other subs either hating or praising us.
5	I have a close friend that’s an INTP and we clicked right away. He tells me how surprised how quick he opened up to me about his troubles as he likes to keep people at arms length and keep a neutral appearance. \n\nHe is quite caring to those who lets in.\nHe also makes me laugh really hard. I find a lot of people are just drawn to his colourful personality.
5	I married an INTP, so I think they are pretty great and a perfect match and balance for ENFJ. I love that we are opposites in every thing except the N - which is why we have such intellectual analytical discussions. We balance each other’s strengths and weaknesses and see things very differently, but the N part allows us to analyze those differences in point of view and not get too emotional about it. 
5	It all really depends on the person!! Some of my best friends, but also some of my most hated people, are INTPs.  Nice INTPs are some of the greatest people I know, but r/iamverysmart esque INTPs really piss me off.
2	You're ENF and I admire NTs.
1	I’m actually dating a INTP. This Friday will actually make 6 years since we been together. We are definitely opposites he’s more of a introvert meanwhile I’m all over the place. However, I think it makes the relationship work well. Despite us being opposites we mesh really well. We balance each other in way. 
1	I have a few INTP friends, and my best friend of 3 years became my boyfriend, and he's also an INTP.  \n\n\nI adore INTP's! They're very cute, sweet, and loving, provided you're close to them.  \n\n\nI love that I've been defended viciously, even if it was unwarranted. The loyalty matters so much to me, and they have never let me down as a solid friend. They pick me up when I am down, they help me work out issues or point out how things could go wrong in a realistic way, and in general are really reliable. I can have deep conversations with them, and at least for my boyfriend, I can listen to him talk all day about what he's interested in. And I have, multiple times lol  \n\n\nThey are wonderful people and very much worth getting to know and lavish affection on :3 
9	Hi fellow ENFJs	I just wanna talk. I'm lonely. I'm putting off all this stuff I need to do for a major project because I don't have that last piece in place telling me to "Go!" I don't even know what that piece is, but I suspect it is approval from a few trusted friends first. It will all fall into place but man! I hate this waiting moment in life; the inhale; the pause at the top of a rollercoaster; the teeter of the first domino.\n\nPS, anyone else love Uncle Iroh? He is just so wholesome and precious. 
3	Good morning! (Well it’s morning where I am, anyway 😃) is your project personal or career related?  I do the same thing VERY often, and it’s totally not procrastination, is it?  Is it time based? How can I help???
2	As an ENFJ currently in college, it always takes a little bit of deadline stress to get me into my most productive state. \n \nI will also sometimes put off things like cleaning, and tend to run on a schedule of accumulating junk or dirt, and then getting so sick of it that I purge it all in a very short window. I know I’ll get the stuff done on time, but sometimes I stress myself unnecessarily to do it. \n\nI’m not fully sure how much advice I can offer, since I think I do the same things, but at the very least I stand in solidarity with you.
1	Hiii!! What’s up?
5	Female INTP vs Male ENFJ Relationship Issues	Hey there, I guess I'm just looking for perspective on my situation from some friendly ENFJs. I'm in a long-distance relationship with an ENFJ man, and most of the time he is sooo wonderful. :) However I feel like maybe he's an unhealthy ENFJ..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI notice that when we are both in a good mood everything is bliss. As soon as I make a "mistake" (in his opinion) in our relationship he turns very toxic. If I am having a rough night he is very adamant that he's staying to talk with me or help me through my issues until I feel better. However, he is only like this for a short time; if I'm having a bad night for more than an hour or two he becomes impatient. It's like he's mad that him being there didn't automatically fix everything in my life. He turns on me and starts to very harshly criticize me, telling me I need to learn to make myself happy without relying on others, making me regret having him stay to help at all. I am used to working through issues alone so it's very interesting to me that he seems to think I can't. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, it seems he doesn't trust me in our long-distance. He seems to expect me to give him updates on everything I'm doing. Sometimes if I take a nap or a shower without letting him know and he was looking to talk (unscheduled) he thinks I was out with some guy or something and says I "will always make these mistakes" and he's "tired of trying to make \[me\] a better person". He will often update me on things and send me photos, so I guess he expects me to mirror that behaviour, which sometimes I don't even think about. :\\ Also, if he is away for a long time without any word about what he is doing or where I am never upset at him. I never expect him to constantly tell me what he is doing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring these tantrums of his where he is basically just criticizing me I usually keep an even tone and just say it wasn't my intention to hurt his feelings or make him worry. I tend to keep things objective, just restating the facts and reaffirming my love and loyalty I have for him. Eventually, after we give each other some space, he comes back and apologizes for his behaviour, saying he's so sorry, that he doesn't deserve me, and that I'm perfect (to me this is also unhealthy). I know that he is terrified of being alone forever or not measuring up to his own standards, and I'm sure long-distance is easier for me to deal with than for him. I really do love him, and reading about ENFJs I can see some reasoning for his strange behaviour, but it's just very taxing and stressful on me since I'm really conflict avoidant and would really prefer to just talk about things without pointing fingers all the time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just wanted to ask if anyone can think of why he would act so erratically. Is this common for ENFJs under some stress? Any advice for how to deal with an ENFJ who seems kind of toxic, or is this just a lost cause in your opinion?
5	He is an insecure and unhealthy enfj. A heathy enfj would be understanding. 
2	This reminds me so much of something I read in "Please Understand Me:Character & Temperament Types" by David Keirsey and Marylin Bates. I really enjoyed reading this book and learning about myself as ENFJ and it's a good starter book for understanding the Myers-Briggs personalities compared to online searching (IMO).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"They \[ENFJ's\] pride themselves on being sensitive to others and caring about them.  It is almost impossible for NF's to be unaware of others' psychological needs.  Yet the NF becomes restless when these ties begin to bind, as they do when the amount of emotional input becomes a psychological overload for the NF.  At this point the NF can seem cruel, insisting unexpectedly that the other 'stand on his own two feet.'  This shift in attitude is usually abrupt and the person who heretofore believed that he was very special in the eyes of the NF now finds himself apparently rejected.  The NF does not mean to be unkind; he or she is simply disconnecting a relationship which can no longer be handled -- in spite of the reality that the NF created this dependent relationship through expressions of empathy and unique understanding." \n\n(pp.93-94, Please Understand Me:Character & Temperament Types" by David Keirsey and Marylin Bates)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
2	Whether he's a "lost cause" and you're just done is totally up to you--no one else can decide that.\n\nYou guys definitely need to implement the core elements to any relationship--communication and trust. During a time when neither of you is stressed out/fired up, talk through these issues. Talk through these patterns that you are seeing. Specifically say that you're not just trying to point out that he's horrible, but instead figure out concrete ways to fix these issues. Don't let him self flagellate, there's no use in it unless he just wants you to tell him everything is fine, and it isn't.\n\nBe encouraging, set concrete boundaries, communicate when there are issues, and tell him when he is crossing a boundary.\n\nThat is all basic relationship advice, I am a female ENFJ with a male INTP. Earlier in our relationship I tended to be very controlling and distrustful. It took my husband being honest with me and pointing out when negative patterns happened for me to begin to change my behavior. It was humbling, but I loved him more than my pride, so there you go.\n\nYou are not there to be his security blanket. To make him feel loved (or rather, lovable), like he can save you (capable), and like the center of your life (desirable). You are there in order to support each other, and he needs to build his self-confidence around something other than you. Build healthy ways of supporting eah other, and you guys will be great. If one or both of you won't or can't then obviously this won't work.
1	Have a read about The Drama Triangle. Not personality based, but it feels like he's trying to be the Rescuer (even though you don't want rescuing), and then becomes Persecutor and Victim when you don't respond...\n\nI recognise his behaviour in past me. I was also very anxious-preoccupied, and was carrying around a lot of self-esteem issues. It's easier for us to project onto other than it is to reflect on our inner state, because in that space, everything is desolate and lonely. \n\nBeing so independent, he probably also feels kind of useless to you, because his "help" isn't actually helpful. If we aren't being helpful, then sometimes it feels like we don't have purpose. We are useless... which again comes back to self-worth. He will need to learn this.
1	any type can have different levels of healthy or unhealthy depending on the person. it's up to you on whether or not to work it out.\n\nfor starters, as you've hit it, he has trust issues. I'm an INTJ, I can analyze but you'll have to talk to someone who's an F-type about what words to say or approaches to take dealing with his lack of trust. odds are he's been in bad relationships in the past where trust was an issue (or he himself is hiding something and it's a projection).\n\nsecondly it's interesting to me after things don't go his way he gets angry. I'm technically an anger-based person too according to enneagram (which I do find helpful), but you've gotta set these boundaries in terms of what you'll take from him and what you won't. punchline is EITHER he needs to learn to be more patient OR he needs to learn to give you your space to get through your bad time.\n\nlastly, and I'm speaking about my observations on the INTP archetype, this may or may not apply to you directly and I mean no offense -- but as another INT, we're hard to read. F types have a really hard time telling what we're going through unless we verbalize it, and even so the verbalization sometime is so flat (because to you and me it's just matter-of-fact) that it doesn't even register to them that we said something important and meaningful. FURTHERMORE because of this mechanism (don't necessarily express much feeling), if when you do express something it's that he doesn't trust you, or that he's not helping (valid complaints), it means he only gets negative feelings to attach to. it's possible he sees you as a loving but ultimately negative person. I'm married to an FJ and she just has to give me space on this. When I'm happy, as an INT I'm thinking. She can't latch onto my thinking as something with relational currency because she's a super strong F. but when I'm upset or angry, that comes out. so she gets upset/anger as her feelings from me and rarely happiness for the sake of happiness (without the thinking) from me. it's just something you grow into in the relationship and not read so much into with time. I'm not an angry person, nor are you a distant person. Just a feeler type looking for emotions to latch onto has a hard time finding them in their INT types especially.\n\nIf it were me I wouldn't leave over this, but I would try to understand and improve. If he shows unwilling to even try, that's a cause to go. But if he is willing to work on it, hear your feelings as if they're just as valid as his own, and figure out steps you each can take to make the other feel more loved and respected, that's great. My wife and I just had an anniversary last week. Every relationship has trouble. Every relationship has distance. What makes it last and what makes it right is working through the problems big or small. In a way this is a fantastic test of your relationship. Is he willing to work on the relationship itself with you? That willingness is ultimately what makes it good or not.\n\ntldr, ALL people are different. in relationships you either move towards each other or ya don't. if you do, you'll find yourself closer and closer, if you don't, you're gonna have a bad time. Most particular conflicts are incidental and the health of the relationship is the HOW and WHY the conflict is dealt with more than what this particular one is.\n\n\n
1	Why erratic?  I heard a good quote earlier something like "People who love themselves can't harm others"   \n\n\nYou don't have a man, you have a boy...  Let me outline the issues indicating this,   \n\n\nHe turns a bad attitude towards you when you make a mistake? This is pitiful.  \n\n\nHe changes how he acts after a short time?  Fickle.  \n\n\nImpatient with you for having a bad night for an hour or two? Remind him who the \*fuck\* you are.    \n\n\nNo trust? Why should he trust you? He hasn't \*earned\* himself the right to trust your loyalty. Unworthy feeling much?  \n\n\nDoesn't like your damn surprises?  Expectations?  They aren't psychicically communicated.  \n\n\nHe is erratic because he is young, dumb, and full of cum. It doesn't sound like he loves you, it sounds like he loves this \*idea\* of you, the one that doesn't make mistakes, the one lives up to these psychic expectations, the one that never looks at any guy but him.  \n\n\nAlso, your boy should know he has Cluster B Personality Disorders. If he doesn't, well , it's time to wakey wakey.  \n\n\nAlso also, all of this comes down to the fact that he is suffering because he has attachment issues. Dude will be better off when he starts being alone with himself, and finds out how to let go of his attachment.  Tell him he is never going to be free if he can't let go of his attachment. Tell him to google Buddha's Third Noble Truth.    Checkmate.  \n\n\nNothing is a lost cause if you are not ready to go. It is up to you. Is he changeable? Of course. Will he? Ask him.  \n\n\nThere is nothing more important to a healthy relationship than collaboration.  A relationship is bigger than either of you, it is BOTH of you TOGETHER.    \nHave the necessary conversations. You and him set expectations together.  Tell him what you expect of him.   \nYou expect him to patiently wait and be thankful that he gets to wait on YOU.  Remind him how fucking important you are. You are the best, you are #1, and if he disagrees, then ask him who he thinks is better than you, and don't be afraid to give him the death stare and wait on him to squirm with REAL patience.  \nYou expect him to be his own independent person, like you are. You expect to get the same level of respect, that he would want his grandmother to have. How would he feel if some guy was giving his grandmother the pitiful attitude he gave you? Punch the fuck out of him, right?  \nSet these expectations, you \*HAVE TO HAVE\* THESE CONVERSATIONS.  Anything can be worked through, because it comes down to two factors. Knowledge and Will.  Is he a bad boyfriend because he is still immature and doesn't know better? Sounds like it to me.  Or is he a bad boyfriend because he wants to live vicariously through you and doesn't want to stop that and start living in reality?  \nAlso, don't let people walk all over you. You are not a sidewalk. People who stress you are not best for you. If he wants to be the best for you, then have him tell you \*why you are the best for him.\* (what you want to do, is take old behaviors, and replace them with new healthier ones, so get him to tell you why you are the best for him, is a way to teach him to use positive praise instead of harsh criticism. Criticism is really probably better kept for yourself, and people who ask for it, because we \*definitely\* don't want to criticize people who don't want to hear it, that is just asking to start a fight.  \n\n\nThe bottom line is,  if your flaws aren't perfect for him, then he can leave!

1	INFP female trying to attract an ENFJ male	Help? ENFJs what makes a person attractive to you? What is the best way to flirt/seduce you? What about an INFP would you be drawn to?
10	For me, intelligence is the most attractive quality in someone. Not necessarily book smarts, but street smarts. I want someone who can have deep conversations and often existential conversations about life. I love open mindedness and people who can disregard their biases in pursuit of the truth in any situation. I also want a free spirit. Someone who can make the most of whatever moment they are in. Someone who is passionate but level headed. I dislike negative mannered people. \n\nAs far as flirting with them... just try to engage in a jovial conversation and ask probing questions. Don't stay in the small talk zone too long. It's fine for breaking the ice, but if you make small talk too long he might think you are kind of bland. If he brings up a random topic he is interested in, try to ask more questions about it. Show a genuine interest in his interests. I feel happiest and most alive when I click with someone who can talk about the deeper things in life on the same page as me, or can read between the lines on topics such as politics, religion, faith, work, sports, or whatever your passions are. We are a curious breed of people. We like trying new things and like being engaged in activities or adventures. \n\nNot sure if any of this helps, but these are traits I have as an enfj and might provide insight to the type of guy you are pursuing.
4	One thing about ENFJs is I think we can smell insincerity and inauthenticity a mile away. Literally the BIGGEST turn off in my entire life that made me run so fast from a guy was when he told me he read a book about pick-up artistry and liked it. To me that just screamed insincerity with wanting to date me and instead I felt like I was a trophy. \n\nSo an important thing (I believe) is to not approach your ENFJ as a conquest or a prize. Be authentic in your interests and your desires. Be honest and open. You can’t go wrong with an ENFJ by just being your true self, warts and all. ENFJs want to be loved and their fear is that they are unlovable. That’s why being honest is so important. If you’re dishonest it’s a sign that you don’t really love them or trust them. Being too private can feel dishonest to us as well (I think) if it comes across as protective of privacy and not just shyness. \n\nI’m not sure if these comments are relevant to INFP or not. Just some general thoughts. 
4	I'm ENFJ married to an INFP.  The thing that's awesome is: He doesn't talk so much but when he does it's worth listening to.  \n\n\nJust be yourself. <3
2	I'm with an ISFP which I consider ideal. strong fi is attractive. having the capability to be a private person, to step back more easily and rely on your own judgement to handle situation, really helps temper strong fe. in a pairing, fi will come up with good paths of action and fe will realize them in an environmentally sensitive way.\n\nedit: I guess to ATTRACT an ENFJ I'll say self confidence is very very important
19	Do you ever feel self conscious when you’re looking in the mirror, washing your hands, and someone else walks in?	It’s like I don’t want to seem vain, but I also need to make sure there’s nothing weird on my face. 
8	No I don't, I enjoy looking at ny reflection. I look at myself and see the person other people see. How I represent and express myself. And I love it. See you have to love yourself and accept yourself and how you look, because that's you and its not going to change much. So take pride in that person that stares back at you.
5	All the time, every time someone walks in and I'm looking at myself, I immediately look away. Funny little quirk of mine, I think it's for the same reason you mentioned-- not wanting to seem vain 
4	No, I don't feel self conscious, although sometimes I think people probably think I'm weird because a while ago, I decided to smile every time I look in the mirror so now it's a habit and I catch myself doing it still 😂
3	I do, but I'm infp
3	yes
3	I sometimes practice facial expressions in the mirror  so yeah sometimes I do get embarrassed. But generally I think this is more of a human thing than a personality type thing.
25	Hello! Anyone else like this?	I am an ENFJ, as you might expect with me posting here in this wonderful subreddit. I wanted to ask my fellow ENFJs if they have the same tendency as I do. This comes from a comprehensive MBTI, Gallup Strengthsfinder analysis that I did in grad school, which I used to create a professional development plan. \n\nWhen I encounter other 'E's, sometimes I tend to have difficulty matching their extroverted energy right away. I tend to clam up at first, in order to determine their energy, etc. I do all this subconsciously. Once I am able to 'match their energy' we almost always get along great. \n\nPersonally, I think it's because I feel like I can control or guide most interactions with people, especially Is, but I lack that ability to guide or control interactions with other Es. I'm sure it relates to the "F"..or feeling of my ENFJ. Anyone else like this?
7	Yes very much so. I'm very good when it comes to talking to introverts because it gives me more control over the conversation and set the energy level for the conversation. Now that I think about it, I'm the most extroverted person in my friend group and whenever there's someone who's at a higher level than me, it takes me a bit to meet them there
6	I personally had this problem a few times, I get extremely shy around other extroverts sometimes, but once I get a feel of their interests and energy, the anxiety goes away and I'm able to get along as well.\n\nI think when extroverts hang out together, they magnify one another to an extreme.  But since you have both people that enjoy talking, sometimes it becomes somewhat of a power struggle between them.\n\nI know my personality tends to be intimidating and a bit much sometimes, which kinda forces other Extroverts to take a backseat in conversation.  So I end up experiencing both sides of the situation.\n\nFrom my experience, ENFJs like to be in control (as the feeling of control grounds us).  So when faced with another extrovert that might have a bigger personality than us, it causes one to be like "wait...they have a bit more control of the flow of conversation than me." then clam up.\n\n
3	ooh what are your StrengthsFinder? I found that 100% just as helpful as MBTI but it's more nuanced to talk about / harder to find a community of.
3	I do it too. Often times if somebody else is itching to be the life of the party I just let them.
21	ENFJ's dark side: experience with manipulation?	I wanted hear from everyone about their own experience with manipulating other people, this is the most common dark side example I have seen from ENFJs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
18	My brother is an ENFJ and he's always been manipulative. If he thinks people aren't going to do exactly what he wants them to do or they're going to do things wrong, he just lies and lies. He's awful at it and it's extremely frustrating to deal with. Other ENFJs I know also do it on a smaller level, where they'll just tell people the things they think the person wants to hear. The problem with this is that ENFJs often have a poor grasp of what people actually want to hear, so they're really just making everything worse. It's not so much a "dark side" as it is a byproduct of their need to achieve social goals combining with their difficulty in accurately gauging social needs. I've never met an ENFJ who didn't do it to some degree.
3	I use to date a ton of people in a short period of time. I'm one of those people who would manipulate to get free food.  If I want something, I could generally have someone do stuff for me. Or I would test people to see what kind of reaction I'd get to be used for later manipulation. \n\nOverall though these days I don't really need to manipulate anyone to getting what I want as much anymore as I'm pretty self sufficient.\n\nI do get frustrated when people ask for help or advice and do the opposite of what I tell them to do. And I don't have the patience to sugar coat what people need to hear. So if I do manipulate, it's too push the person to be better or help them grow. However, I am currently trying the hands off approach in letting people do their mistakes so they can learn from them.\n\nSo instead of manipulating for food, I buy it myself. Now I manipulate people to not even think about cheating on their partner or continuing to play the victim in whatever situation they are in. 
4	Well, some of us ENFJs have the ability to read a person and plant thoughts or suggestions, while the subject thought that he/she made their own choices.  But it will never be used for unscrupulous purposes or to make one go against his/her will. It's done naturally by some of us, as a mode to reinforce empathy and to inspire self-development. If someone is too negative or run against my grain, the most I'll do is to ghost and block the person. I can motivate you, but once you try pull me down,  I'll let go.
3	I am cognitive of when I am juicing someone and/or when I actually care enough to invest. Manipulation/control was a rough cookie to break for me. +1 for Danny Silk's book keep your love on!
3	We think that we know best so we like to control the scenario. I don’t see it as manipulative bc I always stop when peoples will or preference jumps up. However we do not tolerate persistent bad choices. \n\nOne of the worst mistakes I ever made in my life was following others what was best for them - probably permanently making me into the type of person that always wants to be in the drivers seat.\n\nI should add that the choices come from data on what works and what doesn’t and not from enjoying being in control for its own sake.\n\nHope this makes sense! 
3	So true!! It’s good to be underestimated depending on the situation and whether or not you’re trying to influence someone by intimidation. Sometimes it’s sneakier to not show what you’re capable of 
3	Quite a few experiences with enfj manipulation, but most notably with a particular one close to me, who thinks nothing of white lies, whether to protect someone, though most frequently they're just for convince sake's , because she's too lazy, or any other trivial reason. Her reaction when called out is "oh boohoo, it was just a small lie" whereas when for example, her friend lied that he's sick and couldn't go out (because no doesn't mean no with enfjs) she door slammed him lol. The craziest and most infuriating thing about enfjs is how much they moan about being saints and sacrificing things for everyone, when in reality they only emotionally invest and spend a lot of the time thinking about people (idealized usually) and when they don't get the same obsessive attention back, they flip. And  when they do make sacrifices its always conditional and they consider it a debt. It's also mind boggling how different their crowd personna (that literally all NFs fall for) and their real self is. 
2	I often use this talent to help others achieve their goals in a different way than they expect to. I have definitely learned that I can’t tell people what they want, but I can guide them down and alternative route to reach their goal. Especially in a professional setting, most people wants a similar objective, but each person has a different path they want to take. It’s less about manipulating, but validating and combining each person’s approach and meeting everyone’s needs all at once.\n\nIn my personal life, I try to ask questions that will either challenge someone if they are stuck, or I validate their emotional needs if that’s what I perceive is best. I tried to not re-direct people based on when I think is best because it’s not my life. 
2	 \n\nWhen I was a boy 12-14 years old I found passion/excitement when manipulating people. I never understood that this is how manipulation really looks. I used to play computer games (MMORPG's) where you grind all your life for a better character's equipment. I realised that I can easily trick people into giving everything away because I knew what to say and how to say it. I mean I would steal or people would be giving away (as I used to think back then) stuff that was worked on really hard and for extensive periods of time. I found out that alot of people have different triggers and I knew how to work them after some time of chatting.   \n\n\nAt around same age I used to text alot with girls. Usually girls that lived far away from me so I could not meet them. I was very good at getting nude pictures from them. It's so silly but back then I was very proud of my success rates :D I'm not trying to boast but I realised how good I am when my older friends used to get very jealous with my "rewards" :D I really thought of not including this part but let me be 100% honest.  \n\n\nFrom the age of 16 I started playing poker with my friends in person. It was great fun and I was really good at it. I thought I will try it online for some quick cash but it was opposite. I was crap and I was loosing alot. I could not get my head around it why online and in person games gave me such a different experience but now I understand. I ditched online poker and started with pub pokers or any amateur poker tournaments where I have more control over my opponents. I loved it! I actually play poker to this day and I just love that ability of reading or deceiving people.\n\nAnyone around London for a quick poker game? ;)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith my profession I get to train people. This is where I found manipulation most fruitful and I really enjoy. I try not to do this often but sometimes it happens unintentionally.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n
2	So, I used to live in a very restrictive environment where I could never leave. It was somewhat like a boarding college. It was very prestigious and attracted very intelligent individuals, but in return for a full scholarship, everyone there had to follow very restrictive rules. If you got kicked out, you owed the whole of of your scholarship back. It equates to $400,000. Some of you may know what I am talking about. \n\nIn any case, the college aged individuals there tended to be very polarized. Either people I’d trust with my life, or the most two faced, sociopathic and strategic people you could think of. Naturally, nearly everyone would gain blackmail on each other in order to stay safe from being kicked out. If you had blackmail on someone else, he or she was of little threat to you. Even if you didn’t like manipulating, any realist would acknowledge it was somewhat necessary to survival and successfully completing. \n\nAs a result of the inherent manipulation necessary to stay safe in that environment, I became so capable of subtle manipulation, that I realized I started doing it subconsciously, even to my friends who I had no wish to stay safe from. When I realized this, I purposely tried to almost fail my own self...I’d try to purposely not get my own way. \n\nI had been getting everything I wanted way too easily, a combination of looks and intelligence and capability interpersonally. I didn’t think this was fair and resented it. I wasn’t sure what my personal reality would be if I looked different or didn’t care as much what people thought. I decided I wanted things to be fair. Nonetheless, people still treat you a certain way based on how you look and come across. \n\nI got to a point in my life where I even felt guilty for how easily I got what I wanted, was given free stuff for no reason, everyone being nice....I also try genuinely hard to be kind to everyone and take care of my friends, so maybe I’m undercounting the effect of kindness on the general population when most interactions between non-friends tend to be rather apathetic. Perhaps me being kind to everyone is the real catalyst for getting free stuff and being treated so well by a lot of people. Who knows. I mean, don’t get me wrong...there are also a lot who have been out to get me and determined to destroy my life, but people generally either love me or hate me. \n\nI guess the whole point of this is to say that it’s incredibly easy for me to manipulate. It’s like putting a puzzle together and you know just where everything goes....it’s even easier if you don’t care about looking dumb or having people misjudge you, in fact, that can be a incredible asset, because they do not think you capable of certain things which you may be doing under the level. As long as you’re not looking for public acknowledgement of your skills, it’s very easy to manipulate. I feel almost afraid saying that, cause I do believe that pride comes before a fall and keeping humble is the key to being successful. Only when you’re humble will you second guess yourself enough to stay adaptive to your environment. \n\nAnyway, that’s my ENFJ dark side in regard to manipulation. It’s far too easy and I have to constantly try not to do it. I understand people and I understand myself in part, and I know the path to take and the things to bring, but the question is, is it moral? Because at the end of the day, you have to live with who you are and stand before God.  
1	Okay, if we are using the word “manage” then yes, I am inclined to agree with you. This is a very thoughtful response. Thank you! 
1	I’m an INFJ female —\nRandom, but I was seeing this guy super casually, one day I get a bunch of angry texts from his ENFJ ex (who I didn’t know like at all) about how I’m stealing her guy—the next two weeks she’s trying to be my best friend (which is like how I know she’s an ENFJ lmao) and tells me all this shit about this guy but it’s a whole fucking rollercoaster of one day she’s guilting me about having been involved with this guy (she’s obvi still in love with him, calls him the love of her life? Kay) and the next day she’s like all apologetic and wanting to be friends —side note: as an INFJ this is seriously fucking with my head the whole time, like mostly very empathetic with her situation but completely confused at the same time. \n\nAnyywayyyyyy so two weeks later she’s mostly hateful and still sends me crazy ig DMs from time to time. \n\n*bigass shrug \n\nMy best friend is an ENFJ and y’all are mostly awesome but bruh, I feel like when the vindictiveness comes out it’s like what is going on? Whereas maybe as an INFJ when we’re done with someone we just shut the door and don’t bother verbalizing all that shit. 
9	Being physical in a relationship.	So I've recently started dating this amazing girl. She is my best friend and we are very much inlove, but when it comes to physical stuff like just making out she's not really that passionate. She says she definitely likes making out, but she says her focus is more on other aspects of our relationship than the physical stuff. I don't mean to sound like an asshole at all, please don't get me wrong. I just feel like I'm a very loving person, and I enjoy these physical little things like making out. Should I worry that we won't really advance much? Will she ever even be in the mood for such things? If it makes any difference she is an INFP, so if some of you have this personality type maybe you can shed some light on this.\n\n
7	Talk to her and ask her what she's comfy with. Communication
3	Discovering yourself and your sexual tastes is not something everyone has done extensive research on, my dude. Like you said, you're her first. She might not have even given these things much thought prior to this relationship. Being an introvert doesn't help the case much either. It's highly likely that she'll slowly start to learn more about herself in bed and develop her sexual tastes by experimenting with you now that she's in a relationship with you. Give her some time to discover herself.
5	As an infp, I have to say all of us are still very different in relationships. I am more comfortable in sexual relationships than emotional relationships from child attachment issues which I'll probably be working on forever. But I only started exploring my sexual openness in my mid-late twenties.  I take a long time to get comfortable with a partner, to have trust, to be open. Keep in mind, personality compatability still may not align with sexual compatability. Other infp women I know are not nearly as sex crazy as I.  
2	Hm.  That’s tough.  Has she had a past emotional or physical trauma that makes her take physical relationships very slow?  The beginning of a relationship is supposed to be when you can’t keep your hands off each other!  It’s one thing if she’s had some trauma in her life and just needs to take it slow, but another if she’s just not interested in sex at all (If she doesn’t much care about making out I can only surmise she’s apathetic about sex as well). 
2	The both of you need to take the ‘5 love languages’ test. 
1	Depending on how she was brought up, if you’re her first, she may feel that sex is morally wrong and just be afraid to tell you cause maybe she thinks you’ll judge her on it and break up 
12	ENFJs and guilt	How do enfjs handle guilt. I feel like we handle it very poorly.\n\nRight now im feeling guilty about not letting someone take a photo with me at an anime convention. Yet it always goes back to im not comfortable with them. Yet i feel mean, yet im not comfortable 
11	very poorly. I don't even feel guilt in most situations anymore, I just can't. Instead I feel motivated to do better next time. net positive effect, but still goes to show I can't handle the actual feeling of guilt.
6	Well our very nature is to help others. So I'd say we handle guilt pretty well because we will try to resolve conflict the best we can. Enfjs I know and myself would like to hash things out with people than let it fester. Otherwise we set up the resolve to own up to our mistakes. We are pretty decisive in our decisions, which make guilt a non-issue most of the time. It really depends on where the guilt comes from. If by doing a mistake, we right it. If it's emotional guilt tied to self esteem, then we probably wouldn't know what to do. 
2	I'm feeling guilty just thinking about it.
1	Depends on the situation and relationship. Sometimes I can’t feel better unless I’m punished or the other expresses some level of anger. \nIt’s dumb. \n
24	Hi ENFJs	Hi

1	Hello, love.
1	Ahoy 
14	About relationships and social media	Hey guys and gals, \nI'm curious about your preference to posting pictures of your relationship online? \nNot really every detail, but just cute things you and your S.O. do.\nIs it typical of you to pretty much keep that kind of stuff private to the point it's almost nonexistent on Social Media? 
7	It’s important for me to be shown off and show off my partner. It’s not that I need to ‘mark my territory’ or some insecure BS like that , sharing my joy with my loved ones makes my joy richer . \nIt took a long time for my husband to start participating online , but after he understood what it meant to me he picked up on it . 
5	I'm pretty shy with posting personal stuff online so I'll only post on imortant occasions like anniversaries etc. I still show pictures and talk to my close friends and family though.
5	Private 
2	I used to overshare online... then the relationship fell apart, and now I keep it private because I don't need people judging me... 🤷🏼‍♀️ Relationships are good, if not better, out of the public eye.
3	I like to use social media to document where I eat, who I hang out with and what I do sometimes.  Don't really care for much likes or w/e and it shows cus i sometimes forget to post that stuff.  To me, I like attention, but my partner likes to keep things private.  Compromise is that I just dump the photos if I feel like it (most often times I forget and just back them up on a hard drive).  \n\nPrivacy is important and the need for external validation is less when you don't feel like you HAVE to post it for the world to see.  What you two do is your business, not really much of anyone else's business. \n\nPlus i don't want any crazy exes snooping on my private life.
1	I've shared photos of us together, at weddings, group photos, etc. but thats about it. he doesn't post much (he's ifsj) it bothers me a little but not enough to where id bring it up. he's more private than I am. 
1	I literally blast everything I do on social media with everyone I’m with and I’m constantly taking pictures. \n\nI have to watch it so it doesn’t get annoying, but I figure people don’t have to seek out my page if they don’t want to see lol
1	I'm sensitive to the fact that my wife is an introvert, who doesn't generally like her pics posted on social media..so I generally avoid posting her pic. Same with my kids. Not everyone is an extrovert like me, and I try to be respectful of that. Although, you can argue that maybe I'm a bit too careful - not sure. 
14	CS Joseph youtube channel	Has everyone seen this guy, CS Joseph? Really opened up my awareness of how the subconscious interplays with the conscious mind as well as the involvement of the 'shadow' as according to Jungian principles. Has made me feel as though my ENFJ personality type has a dual capacity for potential and beyond. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe it doing an entire compendium of information on MBTI, Jungian principles, John Bebee's work and it's really good stuff. This is just a breakdown of the ENFJ type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n📷\n\n[**31:56**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmzYW_0mfJk)\n\n📷

3	Yeah, Ive become totally obsessed with it. He said he was putting up his own test but i have not been able to find it. have you seen it?\n\n&#x200B;
2	Yasss, good stuff <3
22	Any other ENFJs experience depression while traveling solo?	So this week I am traveling solo for the first time in Sicily and while everything here is so amazing and beautiful, I'm having trouble enjoying everything because I feel like since I've arrived, I've been almost consumed by this cloud of depression that just seems to follow me and won't leave me alone. Usually I can get out of depressive episodes within a decent amount of time, but I just can't shake this. I just feel very lonely and isolated, there are not a whole lot of people around me right now that speak English, none of my friends from my study abroad program were able to come on this trip with me, and in general, I am just experiencing alot of loneliness because many of my friends from home haven't really made any solid efforts to keep in touch since I left the US in August, so I feel like this solo trip has just kind of reinforced for me just how alone I have been feeling. I feel like I'm having a crisis, but I don't want to be. On another note, I dont understand why no one tries to keep in touch with me. Lately I have been just having moments where I want to break down and cry, much more than usual. I just want genuine friends that get me and who connect with me and who care for me just as much as I care for them. Sorry for the digression, I just needed to vent. Any insight from any of my fellow enfjs would be much appreciated :)
11	I moved to California for a while and felt the same way you do. I also feel this way when taking trips by myself. I think we just want to be able to share the happiness and experience of travel with someone else and get sad when we feel like there isn't anyone in our lives willing to do that. Feelings of inadequacy start creeping in, and I personally wonder why I went on a trip in the first place when I see happy couples sitting by each other on a plane or friends laughing together in a car. However, I still love to travel & I will still continue to do the things I love doing even if that means I have to do them alone sometimes. You aren't the only one who experiences this! I'm sure the language difference is also adding to it. When I feel isolated/alone, I reach out to a few random acquaintances with a quick "hey how are you" message. It feels counterintuitive but always it helps me not feel so alone.\n\nVent away & remember to keep soaking in Sicily!
5	I very recently moved away as well, and I understand 100%. I completely relate with that, how people you consider close maybe don't think about you as much as you do and so on. I also know it's difficult to get used to travelling alone, took me a long time!\n\nBut you're an ENFJ. You attract people, and you'll make connections quickly. Just give yourself time to get comfortable!
4	I moved to the UK several months ago, by myself, and had a similar cloud of depression. I think for us, because we like to be prepared, things can seem completely overwhelming if we are in new environments. We don't adjust as quickly as some other types. \n\nI will say that it just took me practice. After a few weeks, once places started becoming more familiar, my anxiety calmed down and I was able to notice more of the details in my environment. I wasn't running on adrenaline all the time...\n\nI still go through waves of loneliness, and I've had to write lists for self care and self soothing to remind myself when I'm feeling low (a hot shower should not be taken for granted). However I'm also more relaxed about travelling solo because I realised that it's not as complicated as I thought it'd be, I've survived thus far (things have a way of working themselves out), and I'm generally more capable than most other types for getting myself around. As soon as I'm in a group and let others lead, I get frustrated because they get lost or can't make decisions...\n\nIf you stay in hostels, it's also really easy to make friends so you're never truly alone. You have abundance!\n\nSending you love and hugs! You'll get through it. Focus on your self care atm! (I took lots of vitamin C to help my body adjust to the stress).\n\nP.S - I understand wanting to connect to people. You just need patience. They will come if you are open to finding them. You will also need to contact ppl first back home. They're too busy going on with their life, and probably think you're too busy having fun with yours. When you go home, it'll feel like nothing has changed, while you have. Take this time to reflect on who you are, and your passions (great to notice when travelling solo because it depends what you motivate yourself to do).
5	I can especially relate to the friends not keeping touch. These thoughts lead me to a cluster of thoughts where I question if I did something wrong or if they’re just not the people I thought they were. These aren’t really fair thoughts because they could be handling their own things or something but it still makes me upset. \n\nAlso I think it’s hard for us to be in environments where we can socialize like we’re used to doing. I know I get my energy from being around people and if I’m not, I would just sit and browse through videos and sleep. I know it must be difficult for you right now so I would encourage you to stay strong and take some of the advice about hostels and such. There’s also an app called Meetup I use on iOS where you’re able to...well...meet up with people who have similar interests or backgrounds as you. Give it a try! \n\nWarmest wishes your way :)
4	I know this feeling all too well! I could have written this post in my 20s. Recently I was talking with my INTP friend about this and she said that she does think of reaching out to me but she sees me as so socially confident that she thinks she’ll just be bothering or distracting me from whomever I happen to be hanging with at the time and so she talks herself out of it. So I don’t think that people “don’t want to keep in touch” so much as they don’t think you need it or even remember their name. I did feel pretty terrible when my friend said she thought I was too cool for her (I don’t want to come across this way!!!) but it did help me realize that it’s not really *me* it’s often my friends confidence levels. So I reach out and tell them I’m lonely and they are very happy to connect and meet me in my sadness. Don’t be too proud to reach out to a friend and be vulnerable with them. You’ll be surprised how they rally around you. \n\nFor solo travel I have also brought along a good book. Not an action type book, but one with rich character relationships. One I really enjoyed while going through a solitary time was JK Rowling’s The Casual Vacancy. The relationships between the characters were rich and complex and I enjoyed spending “time” with them. Dickens novels have this same quality. \n\nI also enjoy writing postcards to friends while on trips alone. Writing to a familiar face and making them feel known makes me feel less alone. \n\nYou could also try joining an English-speaking walking tour one day. You’ll probably meet some other solo travelers who are craving human interaction. \n\nIn the future, you will look back on this trip as a time of enormous personal growth and it will be a fond memory of loving yourself above everyone else. \n\n\n\n
3	yup, I completely understand this. I lived in an apartment close to LA with my boyfriend for a year, He would stay late from work and then sometimes go to band practice afterwards so I would spend most of my days just alone with my cat. It did'nt help that my job was very isolating as well.  I was doing house calls for children with special needs and would spend most of my day alone in traffic or with non verbal babies, just to go home to an empty apartment.  I had such horrible depression during that time and luckily I quit my job and we moved into a house with friends and ive never been happier in my life.  I need people around me I can't find motivation or a will to get out of my room or bed if there's no one around me to converse with.  I like some me time but after about 2 hours of being alone I get so restless and need to find a friend.
3	You should reach out to your friends and let them know how you feel. They might not be txting you because they think you are busy and don’t want to bother you.  
2	I feel like a lot of times, people get into their routines and have their small group of friends and not very many people are open to others not already in their tight knit group. Doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with you. Probably just the nature of other people being closed off. Can you find about 2-3 individuals who you think would make loyal and caring friends and then make an effort to communicate with them multiple times a day? \n\nNormally that’s how I’ve started close friendships. \n\nNot everyone takes though. Sometimes you make a lot of effort and get no return, so if you’ve been contacting someone consistently for some weeks and they aren’t reciprocating, try someone else \n\nI understand the feeling of loneliness. I’ve had to move every few years and consistently go through periods without friends. Just keep trying. You got this my buddy. 
5	Your opinion on private people?	
18	While it doesn’t bother me when someone is private about certain areas of their life, I do value a certain degree of openness when it comes to friendships and relationships. When a person is closed off, or does not like talk about their personal life or share their personal feelings towards different subjects, or talk about themselves, it does make the friendship more challenging and will depend on shared activities, hobbies or profession. While I will respect their boundaries, it feels like we will not experience any personal growth together by not talking about ourselves from an analytical viewpoint. But if the person has a academic background, has charisma and the human connection is there even while being private, it doesn’t really matter to me if they’re private. 
3	Like introverts? 
3	Whats going on? Anything? 
3	probably all murderers. 
1	I don't hate private people, but I muuuuuch prefer openess.
1	I need more details. Private in what way? Everyone is entitled to their own privacy but details can change up the situation 
9	Who Are Your Role Models/Inspirations?	I feel like ENFJs are always trying to better themselves in the things they do and part of this comes from understanding people. We understand how to be self-aware and use our emotional intelligence to be natural problem solvers, making us empathetic individuals that many may come to. \n\nI've noticed that I try to use the qualities and virtues of others as a way to grow myself. My biggest inspirations tend to be genuine people who have overcome great adversity, great speakers, charismatic leaders, and/or people who encourage unity. \n\nSome of my biggest inspirations are \n- Barack Obama\n- Oprah Winfrey\n- Ellen DeGeneres\n- Winston Churchill\n- Bob Ross\n- The rapper Logic\n\nOthers are some of my friends and even fictional characters like Spiderman and Superman. There's always someone who inspires me to better myself in some way to be the best version of myself.

2	My dad, St. Thomas More
1	Hayley Williams of Paramore is the only celebrity that comes to my mind. I feel like most of my role models are people I know. As far as inspirations go, literary characters also tend to be my persons of interest.
1	As an INTJ, I have Nikola Tesla and Albert Einstein.

10	We're all a little broken inside. But death isn't the way.\n\nBroken and being beaten by things means more opportunity to prove the world wrong and that you can persevere everything it's throwing at you. And even if you can't overcome everything life throws at you, it's okay. Nobody is perfect, not even the world itself. The world is a crazy messed up place full of messed up things. But there's also beauty in it. There's beauty in ever success. There's beauty in opportunity. There's beauty in beating the system.\n\nLife may seem hard right now, but remember that your current situation is only temporary. "Your current situation isn't your final destination.''\n\nHope this helps. I hope you find what you're looking for in life. 
5	Can you tell us your story? What actually happened to bring you to this point of brokenness? And no judgement, your story is your story. 
8	What's Everyone's Enneagram Type?	For those of you that don't know, the enneagram test is another personality test that breaks personalities into 9 different "psyches".  For more info, here it is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram\_of\_Personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality) and here is the link to test yourself: [https://www.eclecticenergies.com/enneagram/test](https://www.eclecticenergies.com/enneagram/test).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd imagine most ENFJs fall into the 1, 2 or 3 bucket with an odd 8 every now and again. I've personally tested predominately as a 1 or 3 and even got an 8 once. What is everyone's type?
8	2w3 here.
5	I'm a 2w3.
3	I haven't read near as much into the Enneagram tests as I have into MTBI, but the singular time I took this test I tied for 9 and 6, and the test told me with wings I was a 3w2 (not entirely sure how I can get higher scores for 9 and 6 and be told I'm a 3, but that's what happened) 
3	3w2!
2	7w8
2	2w3
2	i am type 2w1 :)
2	4w3 with a social instinctual variant 
2	2w3 as well
1	7w9

19	Watching this, my first thought was *AHA!!!!! AN ENFJ!?!?* I might be completely wrong but who cares it’s a nice video and his entire channel is awesome (so maybe go check it out)	
5	oh wow, I actually know that guy in real life! I'm not surprised that he'd make these kind of videos, hehe. 
3	Made me smile, I get that ENFJ vibe too :) 
6	Sends shivers down my spine	Ever since discovering I am an ENFJ, I have been so much more grounded as a person. I am a high E (85%) and about 55-60% on the N, F, and J side so I prematurely apologize if I am all over the map/come out of left field. I cannot wait to engage with you all!!!!
4	Happy to have you here! \n\nI'd recommend to familiarize yourself with the cognitive functions. \nAnd check out Socionics; that's a fantastic tool as well.
3	Token intj reporting in. You keep doing you! You're the best one for the job! 
5	ENFJ hobbies	I’m an 25 year old ENFJ male, and I’ve always struggled with a hobby. I do like reading, but I can’t read for too long because I get antsy/bored. Any suggestions? What are your hobbies/how do you spend your time in a fulfilling way?
10	Brainstorm business idea, draw random objects in my room, listening to music (separately from doing any work), read some tech news, learn new language, socialize in social media, do some read-people-expression test, daydream, play mobile/pc game, read some conspiracy theories and religious stuff, judging people, debate with myself, enhance persuasion skill
3	For myself, as a 23 year old enfj I highly value the feeling of freedom in my hobbies. In general, have very emotional approach to stuff I do and I like when those things make me feel a certain way.  I'm into: climbing, mountaineering, photography, music - playing and listening, riding a longboard, running. 
3	I just started an Improv class which after the 1st class I can tell I am going to throughly enjoy. I also like to analyze stocks and try to see the "bigger picture" of what is going on in the US economy, I like to think that I'm better qualified to do this than most :)
2	Maybe you should try reading out loud to people? Oh! You could go read to the elderly!
2	I love listening to music, video editing, anime, film, learning business skills, playing drums and piano, learning languages, cooking, writing, reading travel blogs, etc
1	Working out! 
14	What to do about inferior Introverted Thinking?	Have a problem where I give myself very high expectations to complete a lot of tasks, and I usually get them done.  However when I don't finish them in the time I expected to I start to get very upset with myself and spiral downwards very quickly and then I end up not completing them at all.  I also have a problem where if I do finish a task then I don't know what the next one is, and I get very upset about that and spiral downwards.  A lot of my tasks are towards a bigger picture that I can imagine but not verbalise.  I'm just wondering if any other ENFJ's have come across similar problems but figured out some solutions that would help.  Cheers!
14	I don’t finish nearly half of my tasks and perpetually feel like a failure so... I’m working on it 
13	This is more anecdote about my own struggles than ultimate solution, but I made a lot of progress against this when I learned to just go to sleep. I know it sounds too simplistic, but typically, for me, that downward spiral happens when I sacrifice sleep to finish a project on a self-imposed deadline (or make up for procrastination by staying up). What's really happening in my body is tired and my mind is like 'what's all this physical frustrated/tired energy' and starts coming up with reasons, aka spiraling down. Taking some melatonin or magnesium and just sleeping it off instead of trying to figure out 'why' or stop myself from doing it through will alone never got me very far. Go to bed, get up early if you have to, and forgive yourself along the way (even if you don't believe it at first, just saying 'I forgive myself' will lesson the spiral, in my experience). 
7	Check out Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. I’m reading Feeling Good by David Burns, and it’s really helpful for not associating failure to meet my own expectations with failure in my entire life. 
5	This typically happens to me. One way I solve this is to go to extreme-planning-mode and plan out every hour of my next days. I first list out what I need to do, how much time I need where I can guarantee each one will be done, then split them out in the next days with deadlines in mind. Usually this is good enough.\n\nBut sometimes I still feel unfulfilled with what I have done throughout the day. So I felt like I needed to 'record' my achievements throughout the day to remind myself that I've been productive. The way I do this is taking one of those watches with a rotating bezels (normally used for timing). Whenever I complete or do something, or even make someone happy, I twist it clockwise (maybe 5 minutes for making my bed, or 15 minutes for finishing a homework).\n\nWhen the dial has gone a full 360 degrees, I tell myself that I can be content at this point. A fully rotated dial helps me sleep at night :)\n\nEDIT: rotating bezel\* not dial
4	I literally just talked about this issue almost verbatim with my therapist this week after having one of my difficult weeks of feeling exceptionally discouraged about not getting everything done at work that I needed to get done (a lot of feeling hopeless about not meeting the deadlines I set for myself). It’s a little comforting to know I’m not the only one feeling this way, although I’m also really sorry you’re going through this too. I’m not sure from your post if your spiral starts with any feelings of anxiety. Mine does and then ends with a more depressive episode where I’m totally unproductive, but I’m happy to share what I go through/what techniques I’m trying out.\n\nUsually what happens is a cycle for me. I start off fighting to get a lot of things done because I have a really full plate at the moment with work. Then as I see tasks taking too long to complete over the course of the day I start getting extremely panicked. I start trying to tackle the tasks that are freaking me out the most (regardless of objective urgency or lack-there-of). One tendency I have is to continuously reprioritize my to-do list. Like I just keep rewriting the tasks in different order hoping one of these will be the “magic order” that helps me get things done faster (spoiler alert: this doesn’t seem to help, but just wastes more time). I get myself into such an anxious state, I usually have a panic attack or two by late afternoon, and then I’m so exhausted from the panicking I just get very tired and depressed and go home utterly defeated and feeling horrible about myself without having accomplished most of what I wanted to. It throws off my whole week in a way because the next day I start things off even more anxious than before and the cycle repeats because I’m so tightly wound.\n\nI’m trying the following things this week:\n\n1. When an anxious thought occurs (ie:”I’m running out of time!”) and I start to panic, I literally picture a stop sign and yell in my head “Stop!” I might also experiment with yelling a silly phrase in my head because I’ve heard that helps. Then I physically remove myself from my desk to walk somewhere, get some tea or coffee, just something to get me away from the environment for a few minutes.\n\n2. I am allowing myself to write my to-do list only one time in the morning. Then I work through it. I’m trying not to multitask at all. I find that once I work for 15-20 minutes I get into the “groove” so to speak, and become more enthralled with what I’m working on than worrying  about the encroaching deadline. Plus not writing my to-do list over and over saves me a lot of time.\n\n3. Sometimes I have a thought pop into my head that says “I know you’re working on <thing A> but what about <thing B> ?!” This is my brain trying to get me to stop working on my long-term projects in order to prioritize whatever project is making me feel the most anxious at that point in time. So when my anxious brain tries to pull my concentration from a task I’m working on, I tell my brain “thanks for reminding me about that” and I physically put a reminder to work on that other thing later in my calendar. Then I continue working on what I was working on before. This eliminates distraction so I can be more productive but allows me to acknowledge my anxious thought.\n\n4. I’m making my individual tasks super granular where I can to reduce overwhelm. So I’ll go through each very basic tiny step (sometimes even writing them out) so I see each step as an easier thing to accomplish.\n\n5. In my OneNote (which I use a lot for work) I try to write a few things that will comfort me where I can see them. This includes things I’ve done well at work and successes I’ve had that week so I keep acknowledging the positives. It helps me remember that I’m a hardworking person with *a lot* on their plate at the moment, but I’m doing my best and there’s plenty to be proud of when it comes to my work. I try to pay special attention to positive feedback I’ve gotten recently too, and add that in so I remember that people see me in a far better light than I sometimes see myself. \n\nI’m not sure if any of that will help you, but I’m looking forward to trying out these techniques this week to help me break from my cycle of anxiety so I don’t enter a downward spiral of self-loathing just because I might not be as productive as I want to be.\n\nYou’ve got this. I believe in you!
3	This is not related to the Ti cognitive function.\nIntroverted Thinking, Ti, is about building your own sense of logic apart of the tribe.\n\nThis is about Extroverted Thinking, Te, being efficient, organized, productive, and Assertiveness.\n\nAn Assertive person does not base their sense of self-worth in the external events. \n\nTheir confidence comes from within.\nThey don't care so much about being disliked.\nThey're not easily swayed by others opinions.\nThey take every failure as a learning experience.\nThey don't compare themselves to others.\n \nIf you base your sense of self-worth in the things that you cannot control, for example: the things that you want to accomplish or how you're perceived by others; you're always going to doubt yourself and have a miserable existence.\n\nIn regards to the Extroverted Thinking, Te, I haven't found a definitive answer yet. My life lacks structure. But I'm searching for an ISTJ partner to cover this side.
2	Yes\nNice to know this is normal tho
2	The Ti portion is the "I can't I don't I, I, I..." thinking. What exactly you think ABOUT in relation to yourself is related to other things. 
1	Talk to an I/ENTJ. They’ll be able to understand the goal and create a path forward for you. \n\nI’ve also found day planners to be very useful in focusing on what I get done and validating that. 
1	This is why I hate super hero's, always Fing up some poor obsessive persons plans!
1	I write everything down. I live by my Google Calendar (love the "Goals" feature!), Trello board, and journal. Simple.
19	Personally identifying more with introverts	I’ve always gotten E whenever I’ve taken the test. I am definitely am an extrovert as I feel energized when I’m around people, and I can be pretty loud and outgoing, although only sometimes.\n\nI’m a really quiet, shy, and awkward person, so I tend not to talk or feel the opportunity to talk very much. When I’m with groups, and don’t have the opportunity to say anything I actually feel drained rather than energized like I would if I get to interact with others.\n\nMy closest friends are definitely introverts, and I feel as though I can relate to them more than I can fellow extroverts. I’d rather stay at home and play video games, read a book, or look at memes than go to a party, and even though I’m really outgoing, as stated before, I’m not very social. I would say the type of person I identify most with would be someone you see posted on r/tumblr. \n\nI fit all the other ENFJ boxes to a T, but sometimes I don’t feel as though the E is truly a part of me like N, F and J are. Any insights?
10	As an enfj "giver", you are likely adopting awkward behaviors to fit in better with your awkward friends.\n\nDon't worry, you're still you. Just you with different friends you're relating to and empathizing with would be a you with different patterns. 
4	I thought I was an introvert too but I get E every time I do the test. I relate to introverts but I guess I'm not--other people have described me as an extrovert too and it always kind of surprises me.
3	The letters aren’t black & white, everyone’s results are based on percentages of tendency towards that letter. So you could just be closer to the middle. For example one person could be 80% E & 20% I, another could be 55% E & 45% I. Also, extrovert/introvert is not interchangeable with outgoing/shy. I’ve known shy extroverts & outgoing introverts. It’s all about where you get your energy. Everyone needs social time & alone time, but what drains you or recharges you is different. 
3	[deleted]
7	You could just be ambiverted. I get my energy from being around people I trust but am quiet when it’s a group of people I’m not too familiar with. I sometimes avoid getting food on my campus just to avoid small talk with people or going alone. \n\nIt’s a bit here and a bit there. I also jive really well with introverts bc it makes it easier for me to balance the conversation and some of my closest friends are introverts. I wouldn’t dwell on a single letter too much. It’s more about how all the functions play together 
2	E and I refer to orientation of functions, not social orientation.
9	FE example!	Myself and one other person asked our ENFJ friend 'what do you value in a person', they scanned us both for a moment and said 'brown eyes' with a grin of a genius, brown eyes being a trait we both share. \n\nIs that FE in action or am I looking too deep?!\n\nSide questions:\n1. What do you value in a person?\n2. Have you ever witnessed FE in conversation?
8	I value passion, sincerity, ambition, drive, gentleness, patience, humor, and most of all - being genuine. 
3	As an ENFJ yeah he may have been a cheeky lil Fe shmoozer with that comment, but it was only to make you guys smile, probably. That’s really where the Fe comes in. It wasn’t about the shmoozing, you know?\n\nAnd yeah, it’s easy to see Fe in a conversation. If you feel safe and understood, not judged, etc...that’s usually one way to recognize Fe. But then again, feeling safe and understood could be kind of subjective depending on how one gauges safety/understanding. \n\nAnother would be that they tell you everything they’re thinking and feeling seemingly without purpose or in need of any real feedback, or even if you don’t care. \n\nFe can also be recognized by its silence almost as often as its forthrightness, a primitive example would be the hesitance to make a decision because the Fe is assessing the needs of everyone involved, or becoming silent when they’re feeling negatively towards something so as not to disagree and/or “rock the boat.”
13	My ENFJ weakness has utterly destroyed me. I just foolishly ended my relationship prematurely	You may have seen me post similar issues in the past and I know this isn't really a therapy or a relationship advice subreddit, but I wanted to post here because I have come to realize a lot of my issues come from my weaknesses as an ENFJ.  Also as you read this, if you know a good subreddit where I might better find insight on this please let me know. \n\nIt's going to be a bit of text but I am really trying to find myself so I never let what has happened happen again. I am making the effort to seek help however I know I can. \n\nSo,\n\nLast Wednesday I decided I could not take anymore of my (ISTJ) girlfriend's lack of expression and feeling. This is something that has been building in me for a few months now. I constantly felt like it was only me who wanted to hang out in free time, I was the only one initiating sex, I was the only one whom expressed feelings and talked about "love". I was done, being "disrespected" and just had to let her know. A week before I did this when I first brought this stuff up, she admitted to holding back since she had never truly gotten over her last relationship due to having given herself away completely to it. And wasn't ready. This only added fuel to my fire that I wasn't getting "what I deserved".\n\nSo I blew up, wrote a novel in text message detailing hopelessness in her lack of actions with examples. I wanted her to feel my raw upset emotions about how much I feel and give and do and how it feels like things are going one way.  \nShe replied in one sentence, *"you know what yeah it looks like we should just go our separate ways then, im sorry i wasn't enough for you."* \n\nI was mad. I wanted her to realize she had been taking me for granted. So happy with getting to say everything i felt, i went about my day. Waiting for her to come around. And it didn't happen. 24 hours went by and nothing, i started to falter in my stand against being mistreated and my confidence turned into harsh reality. What did I just do?\n\nI had a long talk with a mutual friend of mine, because by Sunday I had started to lose my mind. He of course has been on me in the past when I've struggled with my career failures and such. (Another thing I've posted about on here). He's harsh in his advice, but he's also usually pretty straight-forward and I was needing that. He was tired of me always "saying" and never taking action. He wasn't surprised that I exploded into this new failure with my relationship.\n\nAfter basically hanging and talking for about 8 hours (bless his heart, his a great friend) I started to self analyze myself and admit truths. Harsh truths that I'm still shaken by. \n\nI am a 34 yr old male who only makes 43k a year in an entry level production/graphic design job. I have no savings. No assets. No equity. Just debt. and what feels like no hope for the future. I have kept myself in this place because I never push myself beyond what is immediately in front of me.  I struggle to discipline myself to learn new skills, take online courses, practice piano, learn new adobe programs, learn code, go to conferences in previous years, and so on. Anything that would better me as an individual I always find a way to put it off. In addition to that, the fact that I know I've wasted my 20s, and now the first half of my 30s is a constant giant weight on my entire soul. Knowing I need to start TODAY working on skills and finding a path that will get me to a place where I can be mentally happy and financially stable, has me freeze up everytime I sit down at the computer to "get to work".  I often don't know where to begin. And on top of that the fact that I still have a long way to go to catch up to my girlfriend (who makes twice as much as me, has assets, her own house, 2 dogs, a great career, etc) has been constantly weighing on me. \n\nOne of the hard truths i realized, is ALL of that stress i just mentioned i run away from. I would run to my girlfriends house and just spend time with her. Being with her, "in the relationship", offered immediate satisfaction and escape from my life's burdens. I started to always go to her house every day after work. We would make meals together, start going to gym together, watch tv together, i'd help her maintain her pool, basically live together (even after asking to move in and being told by her "i'm not ready yet" - I still made myself very frequent in her home life). She always loved having me around and of course when we're together it seemed like peaches and cream. Except for those moments when I wouldn't get to feel loved, or get asked for sex, or she would want to go do something without me all of a sudden. I realized that EVERYTHING i have been having issues with her in, came from her affecting my escapist bubble of coming to her house and being with her. \n\nI was subconsciously manipulating her. By trying to escape my problems of life and not being where she is, I let myself get caught up in the one thing "i was good at", which is being in that relationship. And when i started to feel it wasn't going my way, or being fair I would get upset and harbor resentment. I simply could not see this by being around her. It had become such a habit to just change my life to be based around hers that I stopped going to my apt, stopped working on myself, stopped pushing forward for things that would get me back on the right track. \n\nI'm sorry for this wall of text, but I just have so much in my head that's eating me alive. I can't believe that I let myself get to a point of delusion  where I felt she didn't love me, or care for me, or also want me in general. Because looking back she showed me great love and compassion, was very touchy affectionate, always loved when i stayed over, made me coffee in the mornings, always had sex when i wanted it (even if time permitted such as early morning before work), also helped me think of ways that i could find paths to better my career. She was so supportive and i completely shit on all of that by telling her she was not good for me and that she was not treating me the way i needed to be treated. No, I was mistreating her this whole time, taking advantage of her, and taking her for granted. All because I couldn't see myself using her and the relationship as a crutch for my current state of my personal unhappiness. She said to me after Sunday and Wednesday's talks: "you're not considering my feelings" which only made me upset because my whole fight and argument was about her not considering mine.  But she was right! So right. She's so smart, and so perceptive and I'm ALWAYS SO BLINDED BY EMOTIONS, that I really truly was not considering her feelings. It really was all about me. I didn't even care to consider how she needed to process things, or to respect how she loves. Because she was loving, I just didn't accept how she loved. And I am so so so upset in myself and at the situation. Devastated that I destroyed something so great, because my emotions and need for love took over.\n\n**TL;DR:** I broke up with my girlfriend because I felt like she didn't love me and was using me, when it turns out I was using the relationship as an escape from my personal failures to make me feel better. It all eventually came to a head (in my head) and I made it come crashing down. My gf (or ex girlfriend :( now) is amazing and doesn't deserve what I did nor is she a failure in the ways I said.\n\n**Edit:** Some more background on me. I was raised by a single mom/only child. I was often praised for the most simplest of achievements. "you are so smart" "you do such a good job" "you're going to be great when you grow up" I think and worry it has affected me in thinking opportunity is always going to fall into my lap. When I know in reality it is not that way. I have never truly worked hard on my self improvement and I am basically destroying myself.\n\nAlso, I have set up a Therapy session to talk to a licensed professional this Friday. I am doing everything I can to get myself on the right track. 
14	Well it's always good to hold yourself accountable for your actions.  Honestly though that last bit was still deflecting accountabilty because "having things fall on your lap" isn't an excuse to continue behaving the way you do.  My ENFJ guy friend also faced this issue and is still trying to improve himself the best he can.  It's a lot to do with pride, managing expectations, and setting boundaries.
5	I definitely think there’s room for both realities. It’s amazing you’re seeing your areas for growth *AND* it very much sounds like she had them, too. And in that respect, it sounds like you probably wouldn’t have been happy regardless, if she wouldn’t have been able to give you the necessary level of emotional/sexual validation even if you were healthy enough to not be using her for escape. In other words, don’t carry all the weight. \n\nJust don’t flaw yourself entirely! Every single personality type (and person for that matter) has their struggles that they have to overcome. And just because you have yours does not negate those of others or make your actions entirely foolish. 
5	Well, it hurts.  I know it really hurts.  \n\nSure, you may have made some mistakes, but honestly it sounds like some of your needs weren't being met, and maybe ultimately you did the right thing.  I know right now it just really is really hard to know.\n\nBut try to think of it as freedom and opportunity, and well, you are a good writer and you seem passionate so.....hang in there, be nice to yourself, and give it 100% :)

11	Anyone ever retake their 16personality tests?	So, I've retake my personality test probably once a year for 4 years now.\nI always get between ENFJ and ENTJ\nanyone experience that? 
8	Mine bounces between ENFJ and INFJ strangely. Nothing else, just those two!
4	I got ENFJ the first time and then I got ENFP the second time. But I took again some time after and got ENFJ. Reading about the cognitive functions is what is important and that’s what made me realize I’m definitely an ENFJ.\n\nMy friend got ENFP the first time, then INFP, and then ENFP later on. This was interesting because she was in a pretty dark place when she got INFP but I think mood and everything can cause some differences in choosing the right answers which is why it’s best to read up on cognitive functions 
3	I'm pretty split between enfj and entj. I think a lot of personality actually is dependent to some degree on the context and those questions are pretty context dependent. At work I feel more T but at home I feel more F.
2	Yeah, I retake mine once every while, at the start I got INFP, then ENFP, then ENFJ and it's stuck at ENFJ for a while, I kinda doubt my type though, I'm confused as to what my type is because I relate to most of them 😂
2	When I am in high stress I test ENFP 
2	Users on r/mbti will say don't use 16personalities because it's inaccurate and doesn't account for functions (and it sucks, among other reasons). I personally like it's descriptions, but not the test itself and I feel some of the "key people" are misplaced.\n\nHave you ever taken anything else?
1	I always get INFP-A and I was very startled at first how accurate it was for me. 
1	Im also an ENTJ and ENFJ AAAAAAA
1	I have scored as ENFJ three times over 2 years
1	I used to get INTP, now i'm an ENFJ (which is totally different but i still balance between the both I guess)
3	Need Help: Movie Scenes for a Training Session	
20	ENFJ women from an INFP man's perspective	I have a coworker who is an ENFJ. I have to say, I'm absolutely crazy about her. How considerate she is of other people, her attitude towards life. ENFJs just come at life from this different angle, and as an INFP just trying to keep up is actually a challenge. Not to brag, but I understand women so much easier then other guys. Being an NF I can reap people easy, ya know? Not her though, and it intrigues me.\n\nI love her energy. Her enthusiasm, her flirtyness, she has so much personality. She brings me out of my shell, but sometimes my emotions overwhelm me and I INFP so hard. The discussions we have are so deep, and it's like we're so similar despite Fe vs Fi. She makes me want to be better. I want to be braver and more considerate. I want to be with her.\n\nIf only she felt the same. If only I wouldn't have fell too fast and put her on this pedestal too tall for me to reach. We would be great together. I wish she saw what other girls see in me, my sensitivity, my maturity. She's this charming, beautiful girl, with a heart of gold. I want to rise to the occasion, but she only gives me mixed signals.
16	As an ENFJ myself, I can definitely say that I am genuinely outgoing with almost everyone I encounter.  I feel like some would perceive it as "flirty" but there is a difference between me being very nice and attentive to you and actually liking you.  I still place boundaries on how far I let our relationship go, whether it be platonic or romantic, but I can see if you're looking at it from the outside it might seem more confusing than an obvious answer.  My best friend is an INFP male and my husband is also an INFP.  I can see how that personality type is much more compatible with me than others, so I understand how close you must feel with your coworker being an ENFJ. My best advise to you for reading signals would be how much she genuinely seems invested in you.  There comes a limit to how much time we want to spend with someone if we are not romantically interested, so maybe see if she wants to hang out outside of work and judge it from there.  Being stuck in a work environment might give you the wrong signals since we are forced to stay and be nice and considerate to our coworkers.
4	Very negative on the enfjs\nAsk her straight then
3	Well I'd say, either she has a boyfriend but wants to keep you as a friend just in case, or she's testing the waters ; what would it do to be friend with you before getting further. Third option would be, she's choosing from multiple guys. \n\nAnyway, the ENFJs I know always have something in mind and, if they don't, they make up their mind pretty quickly so you'll know soon enough if you have friends in common. 
6	Hi there. I was in a similar situation a while ago as an infp man. I was heart broken and the ENFJ moved on and left me high and dry. There are a couple of things I learned that you need to know and understand.\n\nFirstly, don't associate the Fe from the ENFJ as authentic. ENFJs are really good at being appropriate and warm. They naturally seem caring and they make you feel understood. I learned through my time that all this is just appearance. You can't trust what you see. ENFJs make everyone feel this way. You are not the special one to this woman. She simply makes you feel like you are, but her actions clearly show otherwise. If she thought you were amazing she would have had you in a relationship by now. Mixed signals is a way off saying - I like your attention, but I don't want to give you anything back for it. \n\nENFJs do not show their selves at all. They have a constant mask on and use situations to appear a certain way. They are masters at portraying a certain image. They are like the rest of us, selfish and seperate. They will do what they must to feel happy, and yes they love feeling social dominance. Be careful. You let her in and she is loving the attention you are giving and feeling pure over you. You are just a serotonin high for her. \n\nLastly, what ENFJ woman want is a strong man to lead them, they can't feel safe is they can trick you with mind games easily, they don't feel safe if they know other woman can do the same. You would most likely never be strong enough for one of the most difficult women to make feel safe. You are a dear infp, much like me, and you need someone much softer and with a tendency to be authentic and not manipulative. Look elsewhere. Don't be fooled by Fe. \n\nGet yourself away. This will only end in tears. It happened to me, and it will happen to you. 
1	Just be careful because it is possible you are not aware of some utter self-brainwashing her charms and wiles had at some point overwhelmingly had plausibly prompted some utter drop of normal regard for self-preservation whatsoever,  allowing her to implant some nefarious reprogramming of your brain synchronisity,  compelling you to oblivious acts of demeaning unthinkable depravity at her now malicious wile,  however unaware of such brain activity or impulse as you doubtleesly would be,  as tragic as that would obviously be. \n\nJust concerned about you. \n\nIf not please disregard this post. 
7	Five Things I'm Not (as an ENFJ)	1. I’m not benevolent\n\nI may not even be described as friendly or approachable. I’m pretty sure I have resting bitch face, although I try not to have screwface because it makes you look ugly. I once told a homeless person to get a job and he peed on the side of my car. He didn’t find that parking space for me, I saw it already and no I’m not paying you for it. That’s not a real job. But I’ve learned my lesson because I don’t want homeless piss on my car. Not because I said something unkind, uncompassionate, or anything like that…just the strong distaste of homeless piss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2.  I’m not afraid of being alone \n\nFebruary is my Social Sabbatical. It’s the shortest month of the year, so clearly I’ve strategically thought this through. It’s after the holidays so everyone is sick of seeing each other, and I philosophically oppose Valentine’s Day, because the day is evil. February is a wondrous month, I watch all the Oscar nominated movies (ALONE), I go adventuring (ALONE), I eat at crowded restaurants on Friday and Saturday nights (ALONE). I occasionally even stay at home, but that’s only if it’s snowing or a polar vortex, but when I do, my nails slay all day…for that day only unfortunately. I sit on the toilet and think deep thoughts for 30 minutes/week. That’s two hours of critical thinking that sustains me for the whole year. I feel my brain cortexes and folds growing stronger and it’s so encouraging! Like I said, I’m strategic about this whole matter and take it with the solemnness and gravity it deserves. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3.  I’m not afraid of being disliked\n\nWhen I was in band in high school, I once told the horns they sounded like indigestion. I understood the stakes, but it was more important for the truth to be told. I’ll put both feet in my mouth, ON PURPOSE just to see if you can handle it. I never really worry about it though, because I can recover. I will admit, there are two people at my job I suspect don’t like me and I have absolutely no clue why. I’ll do anything to make those two like me. They’re a tough audience, they give not at inch…talk about screwface! 45 of those toilet thought minutes go to figuring out how to make The Two Who Don’t Like Me, like me. It causes me much anxiety and stress, but I take Natural Calm to find balance and restore wholeness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4.  I’m not particularly emotional\n\nWhen I have to send food back, I reasonably explain why the dish is unacceptable in its current state. I accept the fact that I’ve probably had a lot of spit in my food; I don’t get angry about it. I actually think it’s a good thing, because the exposure to the pathogens strengthens my immune system and I rarely get sick. Another example is when someone cuts me off when I’m driving, I speed up and cut in front of them again. No road rage, because that’s dangerous and you can’t let the situation get out of hand. This too is helpful, because if I can’t accelerate as fast as I’d like, I know it’s time to get an oil change. Cool, calm, and collected all the way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5.  I’m not a teacher or a giver\n\nNow I’m not particularly proud of this, but I’m rather self-absorbed. It’s taken me a while to admit to myself I don’t give a perfect, brown shit about human injustice, suffering, or misery. Except of those in my immediate family, friend group, or those that like/upvote my social media and posts. And that’s only during Lent and five days before and up to Christmas. Flint, Michigan still doesn’t have clean drinking water? My tap tastes just fine. Prison reform? They did the crime, let them do the time. Police shootings? They should’ve followed instructions. Let’s not even talk about what’s happening outside of America! I am doing all I can to keep myself clothed, feed, and sheltered. I don’t even know who’s running for local office.\n\nWell I hope this helps you all know a little bit about me. I’ve been lurking here for a while and finally decided to post. I’ll chime in if I have something to say, if not I’ll continue to lurk.
15	Hey so reading over this I’m a little surprised at the identification of being ENFJ. I feel like the staples of ENFJ are wanting to your core to help others, not wanting to always be alone and generally being emotional— all of which you say you are not.\n\nI’m interested in what the 5 things you are as an ENFJ. I’m not trying to say you are or aren’t ENFJ, nor do I make the rules haha but just genuinely curious. 
12	You have a good sense of humor, I appreciate that. \nBut, if you're serious about what you said, I don't think the ENFJ description fits you the most.
6	I can maybe sort of understand some of these points, but not the 5th one. I’ve never not cared about others. In fact, I always wish I could do more, but I might not have the time or ability to. If I even heard about injustice, it would upset me. It could be anyone ... doesn’t have to just be family or friends. It’s one thing to not act on it, but it’s another thing to not feel that way at all—to completely not care about injustice and inequality to others. I’ve never met an ENFJ like that and I know plenty. 
5	Have you studied the cognitive functions of the ENFJ? Or taken the Enneagram? \n\nMost ENFJ’s are 2’s the Helper type on the Enneagram, driven by their need to be loved and fear being unlovable. \nI’m a type 4 the Individualist, driven by my need to be different and fear having no identity.
2	All those points are pretty realistic to me.  I relate to this.
2	I also relate to this as an ENFJ, I find the immature ones want to help the world, then we get apathetic at the weight of that, then I reckon in later life I might pull it back and actually help shit. For now though I care about eating, drinking, what I’m doing and protecting myself, idgaf. \n\nI also like to make people like me because I see it more as a challenge then anything else - and I know I can do it to almost anyone.\n\nThe idea of a social sabbatical is appealing to me.\n\nAs someone said above my enneagram is 4w3 so maybe that helps explain it.
1	This made me feel better about myself. Thanks, I needed it.
9	Intuition/enfj mentors	So the co-pilot in our personality is our intuition as ENFJs.  This was stifled in me as a child.  I’m discovering this fact at 37.  I’m also struggling to find enfj mentors.  I figure this is a pretty rad place to start looking for folks who are like minded and well developed who may want to help a buddy out.  Any and all input is welcome!  Namaste. 
3	Stifled? They didnt like you seeing\nTrust what you think you see
3	Would love to find an ENFJ mentor as well!\nYou know who you are - please chime in!
6	How to deal with ENFJ friend with superiority/inferiority complex?	
6	>she cares mostly about esteem and not helping others\n\nI don't think your friend is ENFJ. I genuinely do not value things like status or esteem that highly (although I tend to brag). In high school, I befriended and sat with the outlast girl in our school that no one would talk to or be friends with. I thought it was horribly sad that she had no friends at all, and I couldn't let that happen. I forced her (gentlyish) to go to things with me and socialize and have fun.  I taught her people skills, so many people skills. I did that not for the way people perceived me, but because I thought that was unjust (having no friends) and I felt obligated to help her.\n\nThe point is, the person you've described is the opposite of me in every way. Also, not only are many online tests inaccurate, but also please consider that if she is a less "desirable" type (like entp), she might lie. She could have lied on the test (thinking one way but wanting to appear "better" than she is) or just lied outright on her type. I particularly think she would want to lie if she knew beforehand you liked Myers-Briggs and/or knew your type first (so that you'd appear compatible). \n\nETA: for actual help with your situation, I recommend talking with her about morality. Sometimes I get caught up in planning and doing, and I don't live in the present (perhaps that is part of what is happening here). Abstract conversations are fun for me and help me focus on how I think and feel in the present. That type of conversation alone might be enough to center her. Pick topics that focus around things like sacrifice, humility, failure, self esteem, etc.\n\nIf that doesn't work, then tell her directly that you are concerned about her and her ambitiousness. Warn her that life is very cold and empty at the top, especially if you don't take the time to nurture others on your way up. I doubt she will listen to this advice though.
3	Honestly I do think she is an ENFJ because I have behaved that way. I have had such a horrible family situation growing up where I always felt like I had to prove my worth to other people, because they were so unsupportive. I also loved being right because I was always wrong in their eyes.\n\nI always have and still do test Enfj. \n\nI have grown a lot since. I also have codependent behaviors and realizing this codependency and seeking help, and going to therapy also helps.\n\nIt was my INFJ friend that actually drove me to this. She stopped speaking to me for a year. It was such a huge loss for me because she was the only one I felt I could rely on. After getting help for myself, I reached out and we were able to re-establish the relationship. However she never told me why she stopped speaking to me until after we re-established our friendship.\n\nI really hope you do try to talk to her, she may not listen. She may not be ready too. However for my situation I wanted to know how my friend felt and that year we didn’t speak it drove me crazy not knowing why she was upset with me. 
5	Infp here	I have an enfj friend who insists she hates everyone. She spends most of her day being extremely negative, jokes about killing everyone and how much she wants to be home. She is constantly trying to prove herself and doesn't answer in class or take part in competitions because she's scared of being wrong. She insists on looking after me but I can see it tearing her apart. She is becoming sadder and more distant by the day. She used to be a lot happier, she would call everyone her kids, and talk about how she had to fix them and teach them a lesson but now she doesn't seems to care as much. She is much more focused on looking tough and invulnerable. She doesn't seem interested in anything these days. She spends a lot of time on her phone. Is this normal? Should I be worried? Can I do anything to help?
10	This doesn't sound normal for a healthy ENFJ imo. I've become similarly negative many times before but it usually happened because I either felt like I was being taken for granted or I had been receiving too much negative energy from other people. \n\nYou're a very good friend for thinking of her! I don't know what is actually happening in your ENFJ's life but if there is anything you can do to help, it's definitely reaching out to her!\n\nTell her that you're worried about her, what you've noticed and ask if she's doing alright or if there is anything bothering her. Be your caring INFP self! If she's not ready to talk yet, just let her know you'll be there for her <3
5	Pretty sure she is just depressed. Try to get her to ask for professional help; either a school counselor or psychologist
3	There’s a book called Beside Ourselves & it explains the types when they are at their worst. This sounds a lot like that. It goes into why this happens for each type & how to fix it. 
40	I HAVE FOUND MY PEOPLE!	I relate so hard to every single post here!\n\nThank you all for existing
12	This was my sentiment a few weeks ago. I used to think I was an ENTP or an ENFP. I was so wrong. 
8	Yay! Welcome to the group! 
2	Welcome!!
2	Welcome home :)
2	Welcome 🌈🌈🌈
0	Where my hatred come from?	Trying to figure that out lately. the only pattern i know is cross my path, you are gone as well as everyone like you.\n\nwhat it looks like is the J part pertaining to order.\n\n\nfor example, if you are asian and you cross me, then i will hate you and all asians because i have to treat you that way. ( an eye for an eye thing)\n\nThis example applies to everything. whenever someone tries to convince me i always shrug it off and point at how the world is\n\nat first it was rough making everyone suffer, but now im getting used to it and even enjoy it.\n\nthoughts?
1	Locking this thread. Our subreddit is not a therapy session, and though empathy is in abundance here, we cannot solve your problems and we will not simply tell people what they want to hear to make them feel better. 
23	Dude you need therapy like yesterday 
11	You seem to be in a really unhealthy mindset, atm. \n\nMy only advice would be judge each person as they come; we're all individuals,  with unique values, histories and perspectives. \n\nX
8	Seek therapy now. Any kind of counseling or mindfulness will help
5	You need a LOT of help man\n\nmy enfj friend told me one time he had no one to talk to and that this "darkness" was out to get him. He wanted to get revenge in people who have wronged him. I told him it was no use then he took it into consideration\n\nYou need someone to vent on atleast one friend to regulate your emotions
6	I agree with other comments that this doesn't sound like a healthy behavior. But to answer your question of where the hatred comes from, it's most likely not the "J" in your personality type.\n\nThe human brain has a tendency to categorize and classify things we encounter to make our lives easier since we have to process *a lot* of information. Unfortunately, this tendency also applies to people and the negative experiences we have with them, unavoidably resulting in an unpleasant discrimination e.g. your brain sees one ENFJ is an ass to you so it assumes that other ENFJs are asses too and decides to put all ENFJs in the hate box to make people information processing less challenging and your life easier.\n\nIf you want to talk personality though, I agree with what an INTP said here, this situation sounds like Si going out of control. But a bit of unsolicited advice, to put an end to this response, you need to become self-aware and remind yourself that every single human being is different. Wouldn't you feel bad if someone treats you poorly on the same condition?

2	Can't say that it's good but that's the way I protect myself from bad encounters (even if I don't point especially race). I will judge your outfit, your way of talking and your manners and decide if I want to continue this conversation with you or whatever is going on. 
10	Broken ENFJ	Why is so hard for people to accept our evil side?\n\nTo shoot people down before they become delusional this is not asking to support sadistic or homocidal behavior.\n\nThis is a seeking of understanding the darker side of the enfj.\n\nWhats happening is its getting more and more prodominant has a characteristic.\n
16	Your personality does not excuse your behavior though. We all have impulses, but we don't need to act on them.  It's easy to say it's just who I am, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't strive to be better. I too am also very vindictive person, but I'm not going to go out of my way to make someone else miserable just because they wronged me
5	It is because you pretend to not have one so strongly. It is the loss of appearance that your Fe so strongly conveys that is the most shocking and betraying experience. If you were just your self al the time you would have people around you that love you for you and not the person you pretend to be. 
5	What do you consider an evil side?
1	Meditation helps me a lot with this tbh
12	How can I talk to an arrogant ENFJ?	Hi ENFJs!\n\nI have an ENFJ in my life who's very entitled and arrogant in her opinions. She's entirely against the idea of seeing other perspectives as possible and is quick to judge people as "bad" who do not share every single one of her beliefs. (These beliefs are enforced through social groups, friends etc. Sometimes I wonder if she'd believe smoking was good for you if all of her friends said it was, she's an expert at justifying bad things by saying stuff like "It's good for the soul".)\n\nOf course she'll SAY that she values and empathize with different people from different walks of life but will instantly argue and dumb-zone people who disagree with her. The mere possibility that another perspective could hold more truth or could be better than her assumptions is blasphemy.\n\nAnalytical data means nothing in these arguments and it's all based on how she FEELS about a topic. Who cares if her feelings are wrong or not. No amount of objective facts will persuade her since all objective facts COULD have been tampered with and are therefor not trustworthy, unlike her feelings which can NEVER be wrong.\n\nI can spend an entire week giving her validation only to have her suddenly break out in tears that I'm not validating her. And recounting the times I did doesn't matter because she FEELS as if I didn't do it at all. It's absurd.\n\nI'm personally a Ti user so I'm the exact opposite of this. To me, Feelings are almost always wrong and I use analytical data to correct my feelings.\n\nWe have a very difficult time talking about anything because I'm always open to discuss and seriously consider every possibility and perspective but she's extremely stubborn and can only see life her way and is super aggro about it. If I disagree to anything she says she'll throw a full on tantrum about how horribly stupid or insensitive I must be. I don't get it.\n\nWe're both 27.
20	So much Fi.  Doesn't sound like an ENFJ to me.
6	I don't doubt she is an ENFJ, as I've come across ENFJs with similar problematic tendencies. However, I don't think there is any way you can make her change. It does also sound like she is mentally and emotionally quite unstable, so there may be some underlying mental health issue going on. This can make any type behave in erratic ways as you described above. My advice would just be to set boundaries, distance yourself and limit your time with her wherever possible. If she ever asks for your advice, gently recommend therapy. I know it hurts if it's someone you care about but she can only change if she truly wants to.
5	It's a bit of tribalism going on there with you're either with me or against me kinda deal.  I'm pretty open and try to stay as subjective as I can.  If you tell someone they are flat out wrong, then the typical response is always a backlash.  I personally try to explain the perspective coming from someone else.  Like for example, my ENFJ friend felt like he was wronged my a mutual friend of ours because they didn't respond to his messages right away, and totally made hella assumptions in regards to that.  I told him that the guy was on the other side of the world with hardly any signal, and it's not fair of him to judge our friend like that.  Obviously he didn't take too well to it, but I told him to think about it from their end and explained the core things about friendships.  Friends are not here to cater to one another, and it takes time and effort to nurture.  I told him he couldn't expect friends to do things on his terms if he can't really do stuff on their terms.  It's a lot of emotional communication that helps diffuse the anger and opposition.\n\nMaybe it's the art of delivery that's causing your friend to get into that rage of feels.  In your case, I would have told your friend "how do you think I feel when you're telling me my thoughts are wrong and constantly feeling like I have to agree on everything to keep the peace between us." Like....what about your opinions? Do they not matter?\n\nTrying to talk sense to someone who's emotional with facts doesn't generally work.  Like emotions aren't a very logical thing in their own sense and if someone's worked up and upset, they rarely see reason.
3	What does she say when you ask her why it feels wrong? If she doesn’t back up her feelings, tell her you can’t help her because she’s not willing to participate in problem solving
5	So it seems clear to me that she is an ENFJ. I’ve known plenty of ENFJs and contrary to what others may believe, we all are different. We are not all Oprah, though we may see ourselves in that way. Oprah type personalities could also be INFJ. ENFJs personality develops and changes throughout childhood, adolescence and adulthood. This [article](https://personalityjunkie.com/enfj-type-profile/) is a must read on this subject and will go much deeper than I can here.\n\nBut here is my honest opinion. I’ve had friends who were ENFJs who were also bipolar and borderline. It seems to me that the reason why people may assume she is not an ENFJ is because her personality is skewed towards the extreme and this may be due to a mental illness or a personality disorder. It may be important to look into this for her sake. She does exhibit some borderline tendencies. That’s my honest opinion. A healthy ENFJ does not act that way.
1	I wont say you should challenge her cuz that might trigger her attitude. Give her your advice and  a little piece of your mind in a calm \nmanner . If she gets angry at you then that's her problem already. Youre not always going to listen to her. 
91	Avoiding the dreadful #loop , becoming desperate for connection. ENFJ sadness hits pretty hard. Anyone else feel this today?	
19	Yeah, wasn’t able to find anyone to hang out with this weekend. I know it’s only one weekend, but hate spending that much time by myself.
10	Y'all are lucky you at least realize what's causing your depression. I used to mope about not understanding why I felt so depressed.i thought I could just will it away through meditation. Turns out I just need some company.\n\nSorry good friends and reliable friends are tough to make.\n\nI like to go to my local board game store when I have nothing else to do. They usually have events later in the night and I get to socialize then. Not everyone there is very good at socializing but it's still a great way for me to talk without drinking.
8	Yeah, very much so today. Sometimes I feel like it would be so much easier to be an introvert.
8	This is me today...well actually everyday
6	Take control of my physical environment/make use of my Se and clean my room & light a candle (clean, nice smelling space makes me feel better), make a cup of hot coffee, sit outside and drink my coffee/smoke a bowl and sit with my dogs and listen to the sounds of nature to get my mind back into the present moment before it jumps down the rabbit hole of loneliness. 
4	Oh my goodness, I relate so much. 
6	This was me in my 20s. I remember walking to the mall just to be around people. It would usually make me tearey though -all these potential friends and no one will talk to me!  \n\nNow I’m in my 30s and I have a toddler who literally wants to see me and spend time with me every waking minute of the day. I can’t even go to the bathroom without his company. So my ENFJ cup is very full...perhaps too full! \n\nIt’s not great advice to tell random strangers on the internet to “hang with toddlers...they are the dream companion for an ENFJ” but it’s kind of true. Volunteer to be a big brother/big sister to a lonely kid who needs some attention and you probably won’t care as much if your friends are busy. 
3	What do you guys do then if you cant hangout with people? 
4	Been this way for my entire life. Finding real connections (and keeping them in your life) are hard. So many people come and go in my life and hardly stick around. Very very few of my friends were as loyal and courteous to me as I was to them (not trying to sound arrogant :/)
3	Just to throw some balance in here, I’m enfj and love having some alone time each day. Helps me work out everything that happened recently. Surely the introverted intuition part of us needs this? Like I always think we’re the perfect monks/meditators, seeking harmony externally and then diving deep internally for a greater balance. \n\nIf you don’t like those alone thoughts you should think about why and process them. They will never go if you don’t give them their time in the spotlight of real mental reflection.
2	Yup. Same.
2	Interesting. I also hit up random people. Not so much because I mind being alone with my thoughts. I more or less have already gone through all my thoughts and filed them away, so I'm just bored of introspection and need someone to hang out with. Usually this just manifests in going out by myself cuz I have no friends, rip.

70	AMA ENFJs and relationships	So, I've noticed as of late there have been a surge of posts in this sub in regards to relationships and dating for ENFJs.  I decided to write up somewhat of an FAQ so then people can have some of their questions answered.  People are free to post their own personal questions and concerns, this is just more of a supplement and semi AMA in general. Feel free to discuss whatever here.  This is mostly me answering in terms of how I personally behave, and other ENFJs might totally clash with it.  Feel free to ask what you'd like and I'll answer honestly.  Remember, we are all individuals and have different sets of personalities...mbti is only one part of it.\n\n**How do ENFJs behave**\n\nWe are a very social type and enjoy being around people.  We love to be of help to others and find fulfillment in listening/providing advice.  I personally enjoy assisting people who are down on their luck and do my best to help affirm/validate their feelings.  However, I do not enable poor behavior and will not hesitate to voice my opinion if I disagree with said behavior.  I'm pretty sure most of us can agree that we do not tolerate people who aren't genuine.  We appreciate honesty and loyalty.  \n\nWe also like to try and help fix people's problems.  Like something I always struggled with is wanting to help someone resolve whatever problem they are having.  However, in reality, they just someone to validate/affirm how they are feeling and just agree with how sucky the situation is.  Like for example, if someone has fallen down, instead of picking them up, lay down with them until they are ready to get back up again.  I also use to struggle with trying to help too many people at once.  Basically absorbing a ton of negative energy that ends up draining me for the most part.\n\nIf I am upset about something, I need to talk it out to process my feelings.  I will chat it up and vent until I feel better about it.  I also can't handle being alone when I'm emotionally down.  Surrounding myself with friends is a big thing and if they aren't available IRL then I'd hangout with them online.\n\nI personally like to keep in touch with people that I care about and occasionally forget to respond to messages.  However, it's unlikely that I'd not respond to a close friend within a day or two…unless I had a night out drinking.\n\nWhat cheers me up is being able to hang out with my friends, play video games, or binge watch a random cartoon.  Going out to grab dinner eating my favorite foods with people is also a good plus.  Social recharge in general usually revitalizes me.\n\n**How do I know if an ENFJ would be interested in me**\n\nIt's a common question I run into a lot in this sub.  It will be extremely obvious if an ENFJ is head over heals for someone.  We are a social bunch, but we tend to be extremely affectionate to said crush.  If you can't tell because we are still pretty flirtatious to other people, then ASK. \n\n**What are traits in an ENFJ that one should watch out for**\n\nDespite being great helpers and caring people, ENFJs also have their dark side.  We are generally good at reading people and while that's great for social situations, it also means we have the ability to manipulate others. A mature ENFJ would use this ability to help push their friends in self improvement. While a toxic ENFJ would use this ability for personal gain.  I've seen ENFJs that act really needy and entitled with their loved ones.  Due to the fact we require a lot of social energy from others, it also means we are susceptible to an extreme fear of loneliness.  Which is why ENFJs can guilt trip people into hanging out with them and basically becoming social parasites who need to get their way.  \n\n\n**Relationship tips in general**\n\nIt's an extremely popular topic that's pretty complicated and not MBTI specific.  I've had quite a bit of experience with this subject and am confident in how it generally is.\n\n-If you have a question about someone you're involved with and you want to know what they are thinking, you gotta ask them directly.  People loooove to speculate and discuss theories of why people behave the way they do and what their intentions are.  However, a lot of people here can provide their own perspective on their experiences, but this might not fit the specific situation you're in.  Communication is super important in relationships (or friendships), if you can't talk it out with your partner, then there's not much total strangers can do to help you feel better.\n\n-Relationships aren't the key to happiness.  There are plenty of miserable people who are in relationships that aren't good for them.  It's really easy to think relationships are the best thing ever because of social media and entertainment, but these things never show the work and effort these people had to put in to make their relationship work.  If you're single and are unhappy with yourself, then more often than not, you'll still be pretty sad when you're with someone.  Only instead of just you being sad, you're also making your partner sad.\n\n-Managing expectations and setting boundaries is extremely important!  If you're not in a relationship with someone, you can't expect them to do certain things to cater to your expectations.  This includes exes or people you're interested in dating but aren't in that commitment stage yet.  The don't owe you anything and if there's no commitment, then you literally have nothing to do with their life. If you're in a relationship with someone, then both of you need to be clear with what you want out of the relationship and what's expected. COMMUNICATE your thoughts and your needs with one another.  What's ok and not ok to do in the relationship.  \n\n-Again I can't stress enough how communication is extremely important. Nobody can read the minds of the other and you can't expect someone to know what would hurt your feelings.  It's also the same for the other person as well.  Assumptions shouldn't be made and people need to talk it out.  Lack of communication is the number one reason why couples are unhappy.  It also leads to jealousy, distrust, paranoia, anxiety, and a shit ton of other things.  Listening is also just as important as talking as well.\n\n-Loneliness is a big drive for everyone to want to be in a relationship because having a partner feels like you have at least one person who values your time and experience.  Just note that it does not fix whatever issues you have going on and getting into a relationship for that reason will only lead to codependancy.  Putting all your source of happiness on your partner will be very taxing on them.\n\n-When is anyone ready for a relationship?  Not everyone is ever really ready, but a big thing is being happy with yourself while you're single.  Also being able to convey your thoughts and having confidence.  Honestly though, people can only learn how to handle a relationship after experience.  It's a ton of trial and error.  The most important thing is not to give up on the idea of finding someone, even after facing hundreds of disappointments.  Finding a compatible partner is very difficult, but meeting with different people and figuring out what you want in a partner is part of the process.  If things don't work out, then it's good to introspect and learn from the experience/pain and moving on.\n\n10/15/2018\n\n**More ENFJ weaknesses**\n\nENFJs more or less tend to be pretty vindictive in their own way.  Like it doesn't take much to make us adore you, but if you get on our bad side, we won't forget.  ENFJs may tend to be controlling and may not know boundaries.  I feel ENFJs tend to be more forgiving though if the apology is well thought..
22	This is the best guide to follow for all the people asking about ENFJs and relationships. I can relate to a lot OP said here but it’s important to remember that each ENFJ is different than the next. We appreciate straightforwardness and genuine people more than anything so just ask about our feelings and we’ll be happy you asked directly. 
11	+1 from a fellow ENFJ. You nailed it on the head. 
7	Bless. 
5	This is lovely, thank you
3	This was extremely helpful
2	Hey! Great post idea I've been wanting to ask something but it's jumbled and doesnt seem post worthy, hopefully you can offer some insight.\n\nI have an ENFJ I find charming and fun to be around with a positive energy but only see him in passing and group lunches while at work;\n\nIn passing we wave to one another cheerfully say hello and then we are off our separate ways to do our jobs leaving no real time to get to know one another. This leaves me full of glee but then I notice he greets everyone just as cheerfully and it kinda loses its spark?\n\nThere are also group convos at lunch breaks. I do my best to talk but find it hard to be genuine in a group and come across as a dweeb. In the groups I realize I gravitate toward him giving him gentle compliments and affirmation when hes acting funny which he seems to appreciate but it's hard to tell.\n\nHe seems to not focus on one person he seems to just talk to everyone equally/have no particular interest in one person.  In this aspect we are opposite and this is what leaves me feeling confused whether he'd be open to friendship or is just being kind in the moments we're together? \n\nWhen the group lunch dwindled to 4ish ppl I awkwardly asked for his phone number/everyone in the groups number so it wasn't singled out and he grabbed my phone and put it in. I felt bad about this bc the timing felt off and worried I pressured his number out of him and thus i didn't message him because I feel the convo would fall dead and itd just be uncomfortable whenever I see him. I'd rather get to know him first.\n\nI'm pretty sure I have a crush on him but it seems clear he isn't interest in me/isnt drawn to me. Which is understandable as we haven't even has time to talk but weirdly enough I just want a friendship? But ofcourse I can't force a friendship? \n\nI suppose advice on how ENFJ's show genuine interest in friendship beyond aquaintences would be awesome and appreciated & how to maybe make a 1 on 1? Do Enfj enjoy 1 on 1 with newer people? 
2	my friend enfj sometimes guilt trip me haha to socialize on phone if he wants to hangout with me which i find draining but he can get the message if hes persistent and he would stop 
2	I wish someone would post this information at this level of detail for INTJ's

1	I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n- [/r/u_darkmastermindz] [AMA ENFJs and relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/u_DarkMastermindz/comments/9prs55/ama_enfjs_and_relationships/)\n\n&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
1	This is spot on. I dated an ENFJ and it pretty much went like this. He kept wanting to change me and push me. Everyday it was something else, read this book, do this meditation, think this way. Don't think that way. A lot of the suggestions I liked and applied to myself, but sometimes he would get mad if I would do something he was trying to get me to change. I would say, you are right, I shouldn't do that, but you need to be patient with me. You know? If you have a bad habit you have done for 10 years it is not like someone says dont do that and suddenly you are cured of said habit. He was not very patient though.\n\nOther note was he started getting suspicious of me. He did not believe me if I was hanging out with a friend and he thought I was cheating on him. He would not let me bring friends over to our apartment unless he was there and approved of it. In that aspect he was very controlling. I never cheated on him but he accused me every day of cheating on him. He begged me to tell him I cheated on him so he could forgive me and move on. But how could I admit to something I had never done? It made me resentful and I broke up with him.\n\nI guess it was not meant to be.
1	So the  ENFJ I was dating as I have put on my many posts drunk called me last weekend. Flirting with me. Apologizing, asking me why I am not mad or yelling at him, and how he thinks I am incredible sexy and beautiful. Have you ever done the drunk calls to the opposite sex you weren't into that much? I may be overthinking it and I know you have repeated the not every ENFJ is the same thing but I am just wondering if any part of that makes sense to his personality type.
10	ENFJ dating advice	Hey! INFJ male here.\nI recently met a very interesting and sweet ENFJ and she asked me out for lunch.\nAre there any things you guys feel I should be cautious or mindful about? Or do you guys have any tips/advice in general?\n\nThanks ❤️
12	INFJ with ENFJ girlfriend. Couple of tips:\n\n- Since it's your first date, please be courteous and minimize use of Ti and let your Fe shine. She'll love that. With ENFJs, you gotta be careful. Too much Ti at the wrong time can spell disaster on the relationship, especially if the ENFJ is young and still in the early stages of developing their own Ti.\n\n- I know we're good listeners by nature, and so we keep our personal details close to our heart, never letting anyone else get close enough to know about them which gives the infamous "mysterious aura" to us. But an ENFJ who is willing to get to know you (otherwise she wouldn't ask you out) can get easily frustrated if you don't stop her from blabbering and introduce yourself. Yes you read that right. You'll have to cut in and take the initiative. Give her the basics, at least something for her to think about after the date is over. Or they think, think, think and reach the conclusion that since they were the one talking the whole time, you're too reserved of a person for their taste. This only applies if you are genuinely interested in them, though and  seriously look forward to being with them. So remember, if you are, you're a salesperson and you have to sell yourself to her (figuratively speaking). So talk about yourself.\n\n- Don't boast. They don't like it.\n\n- Don't come on too strong. You'll scare her away.\n\n- Talk about "cute" things about yourself. Point out if you're a vegan/vegetarian, if you're an environmentalist, if you're an activist, if you love nature/hiking, if you love animals/children or if you have volunteered for a good cause just out of the goodness of your heart. They love it. Shouldn't be too hard, we have Fe pretty high up in our stacks as well.\n\n- Behave yourself and if you're at a restaurant, you're more likely to be judged by how polite you were with the waiter.\n\n- Last but not the least, be patient. ENFJs are extroverted, active, beat themselves up over little things, can act a bit immature when they're depressed and have very varying levels of emotions depending on the time of day, time of year, the company they've been keeping, how much they've been socializing and what has been going on in their lives. They're very dynamic creatures and tend to be all over the place as they stretch themselves too thin trying to do too many things at once as opposed to most INFJs who are usually laid back and focused. I guess this isn't exactly a "first date" advice but more of a if-everything-goes-well-and-you-guys-end-up-together advice but in any case, it takes more effort than usual on an INFJ's part to keep up with an ENFJ, mentally as well as physically. So if you think you're up to the challenge, good luck.
11	Be sincere! We ENFJs really appreciate honesty so be your genuine self and we'll fall for the wonderful person you are! \n\nListen to her but take initiative in the conversation too! While ENFJs are infamous for never shutting up, we actually love to listen to people: their ideas, their life, their whatever.  We're people oriented after all.\n\nBut really, just be yourself and we'll love you! Good luck and go get her!!
4	Awe so sweet, I wish I had some tips, but from what I know as a third party reference - just let it flow, see what magic happens, maybe you might explore Spongebob on a philosophical level!\n\nKeep calm, relaxed, cool, charming, mysterious enough, and I don't see any potential problems for a few dates in the meantime...
4	be warm and funny
3	Wow, I am so happy!!! I love INFJs and feel attracted to them!!! :') (romantically and platonically) Just be yourself and be genuine!!! :) I'm sure you will be loved for who you really are!!! :D Don't be afraid to lay your heart bare~ your vulnerabilities, secrets, dreams, aspirations, ideals, pet peeves, and EVERYTHING!!! We love to hear those and know the depth of your soul! :)
3	Enfj female here! Been with my infj bf for 13 months now and I absolutely love him.\n\nFell in love pretty easily because I found his Ni ideas and dreams so interesting to listen to. But he was super sweet and took good care of me. Constantly checked up on how i was doing, bought me food and coffee (we were both studying in grad school), and would stay up long hours with me so I wouldn’t have to study alone. Just make her feel cared for and understood! Because enfjs are pretty much doing that all the time for everyone else and it’s nice to be on the receiving end. :) 
2	Thankyou everyone for this wonderful feedback! ☺️ you guys are amazing!
11	ENFP looking for ENFJ relationship advice	Have any ENFJ's here dated an ENFP??? I am an ENFP, dating an ENFJ. We communicate really well usually, have so much fun adventuring together, and both love to laugh and make each other smile. However, I am a very touchy and affectionate person. I give and crave attention, a lot (ENFP life), but my ENFJ partner does not give it as much and it often results in me feeling bad about myself or feeling unwanted. I then question if he is with me bc he truly loves me (we have dated for 2 years) or if he stays with me (being an ENFJ) just for the sake of being kind to me.. I know he loves me and cares for me, but is it as his partner? Is he happy being romantically intimate with me? Is this normal for an ENFJ to not be as affectionate as an ENFP, what are some habits that you guys have in a relationship? Have any of you dated an ENFP, and if so what was it like? Did you encounter similar problems? 
5	I've been romantically involved w/ an ENFP girl and would say I still really like her. She's very touchy and affectionate like most ENFPs, even more so than ENFJs which is saying a lot because I would consider myself to be very affectionate. However, I don't need to give that affection all the time. Sometimes I'll show my care through words of affirmation or help them with something. I don't think it's any lack of loving you. He might just not show the care as much but I'm sure he shows it other ways. \n\nIf it's something that goes on for a long time, there could be something that's stressing me out in life. Usually for me, it's something with my career or family but we'll hardly open up about our own struggles and will need others to unravel us slowly without us asking for it. I'd encourage communication about things going on with him because we appreciate straight-forwardness and sincerity above all else\n\n&#x200B;
6	The things you described are point by point my last relationship, which was with an ENFP. We are still great friends. I did not realize this was an ENFP thing, craving intimacy. The relationship ultimately ended because of long distance. The need for intimacy and affection wasn’t enough for her on the phone or when we would meet for a weekend once a month. \n\nFrom my experience, a relationship with Ann ENFP feels natural and comforting. You can experience the deepest love and care for one another. I think ENFJs feel an overwhelming desire to please and help their partners. It becomes a part of their identity, to help wherever they can and come up with solutions. To be intimate whenever possible, grabbing her hand, picking a rose, twirling her under a street lamp. We are in a way old school romantics and this is exactly the way ENFPs would like it. But overtime, the comfort level slips in. Life kicks in. ENFJs can experience struggles, mood issues and anxiety which ENFPs are not perfectly suited for fixing. They offer advice but it often feels superficial. They offer solutions but it feels like they are personally sacrificing something from themselves in order to make it happen, which leads to guilty feelings for the ENFJ. The desire for intimacy at all times can be overwhelming for an ENFJ, as they tend to regiment things in their lives for appropriate times. almost schedule building. The awareness that the ENFP has tied the relationship down to intimacy is also overwhelming. If he isn’t being physically intimate, it means I’m doing something wrong. It’s a level of insecurity that both draws us in to help, and at the same time repel us, knowing that the solution is only temporary. \n\nSo in short, the ENFJ makes a significant mistake, where he/she ties their identity and self-worth be able to help someone. The ENFP makes the mistake of tying intimacy to their identity and self-worth. This leads to relationship troubles down the line unless the ENFP becomes more independent. But in having to become more independent the ENFP becomes resentful. They feel like this isn’t what they signed up for, and this person is not the person they knew. Not understanding their partner becomes a major issue, which makes the ENFJ feel like a monster. The ENfJ retreats. Leading to even less intimacy. It’s a terrible situation to be in. From the ENFJ perspective, I think it important to not make the relationship and self-worth to depend on physical intimacy. \n\n
4	ENFJ here. We absolutely love the affection. Hugs cuddling kissing any and all kinds of affection. The only reason why I would not reciprocate the affection is because I’d be scared of making the other person (you) uncomfortable.\n\nWe ENFJs have slow starts because of our Se cognitive function is in our “child” slot or “innocent” slot. So our external sensation is very childlike. We may like it, we may not like it. And we treat each situation as a unique situation so we treat it differently each time. This is why we question loyalty a lot. And this is why we question our self esteem a lot. WE LOVE reinforcement with our actions. SO when the ENFJ DOES reciprocate, tell him/her that you like it. \n\nAnd because our Si is in our “trickster” slot or “unawareness” slot, we have a hard time learning from our past experiences. We suck at long term memory; even though we say we are good at it, we are really not. BUT the more affection you show the ENFJ, they will get used to it. \n\nHope this helps \n\n
3	My whole relationship ended exactly because of this. Male ENFP here. It was fucked up man, I still love her so much and it fucking sucks we had to cut each other out. \nI'm literally left here depressed and I can't get intimate with anyone else cause it just doesn't feel the way it used to with her. Fuck.
2	Only way you'd know is if you ask him yourself.  Talking about how you feel and getting that affirmation/validation is important.  The questions you've posted are the things you need to talk to him directly about.  Asking random strangers what he thinks and feels is kinda irrelevant because we are not him, nor do we know him.  Otherwise though, I am extremely affectionate to my INFP and I always give it my 200% in affections and cuddles to him.
2	The ENFJs I know love hugs and cuddles, but it's a very individual thing - each person has different love language preferences and it doesn't always correlate to MBTI type. It also could be an issue related to attachment style, as people with avoidant attachment styles tend to dislike too much affection and cuddling. Personally I couldn't happily date someone like your ENFJ partner, as I need lots of hugs and snuggles, but it's up to you how important it is. For some people it's a nice (but not essential) bonus, but for others it's essential. I know for me it's essential.
24	I Need to Talk to Someone.	I Feel Empty,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEmpty as only a glass half filled can be. Empty and sad. \n\nDo you know that feeling ? Like if you were reaching for something better and it seems like it's getting further and further away as you moove towards it? I feel incomplete and not capable. \n\nI am a twenty years old male who is almost 3 weeks into his first year of university. I live in Switzerland, got a pretty decent  and unearned physique, a pretty decent mind and am quite charming people tell when I manage to get a deep conversation going. (Otherwise I fumble around in conversation, style and studies)\n\n This year was rough. Not the hard kind of rough, this year was not really hard to live through, up to now at least, but it got pretty ugly, pretty... hellish we might say. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn order until now: \n\n1) Got thrown out from my group of internet friends by a parasite who would deserve his suffering to be maximized until the end of his miserable and worthless life.\n\n2) Figured how I was on a path to willingly-blind self destruction.\n\n3) Got my every political beliefs and values challenged .\n\n4) My Grandpa died. \n\n5) Started to feel Lonely and noticed that really no one in my IRL friends group really cared about me, If I ever got in real trouble I would be on my own to deal  with it.\n\n**MAY  OK Here it gets just ridiculous.**\n\n6) Received a message at 11pm from my best friend from the internet group mentioned in "1". After telling me he was sorry three times in all caps he told me I was right from the beginning about the Parasite.    \n\nThe Parasite raped one of my friends.  **Multiple times.**\n\nUntil 4 in the morning we were talking to her on Discord. I think I talked her out of jumping from her window. \n\nI had history exam at 8. \n\n7) I learned how so many people pretend to believe in values like respect, consent, tolerance, and equality but when they are confronted with the exact opposite of those, just let the most horrible things slide.\n\nI Left the Internet group for Good now. One month later that guy was jolly and playing with his "friends" in it. I has to leave. They made me sick.\n\n8) learned I would be able to kill someone remorselessly. \n\n9) Decided to be better. For myself, my friends, my family and the world around us.\n\n10) Worked on the woodwork of my house with my dad, then on the roof for most of my vacations. (Vacations ?)\n\n11) Read Books. Like 7-8 of them. Would have liked to have read more.\n\n12) Went to parties. Dealt with my IRL friends problems, sometimes break ups, sometimes other less important things.\n\n13) Started university. Decided I wanted to make friends, Lots.  And I did.  But I feel that same distance establishing itself and it's killing me. \n\n14) Went to university parties. Felt a lack of meaning in all that was done there.\n\n15) Got sad because I don't have any girl in my life right now and I lack an intimate, and close relationship.\n\n16) Started already not to pay enough attention in class. AGAIN\n\n17) Noticed I am adicted to video games and am spending wayyy too much time on them. (1 to 4 hours/day) \n\nDon't know what to do. About it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to be someone great. I am not and will not be satisfied with a normal existence. I was happy those last few days and then got crushed by doubts. I want to suceed in my psychology studies. I want to write for a living but Fear is stalking me. I am afraid I don't put enough effort into bettering myself, because the change is so slow and there's so much I got to fix about me If I ever want to become someone worthy of my respect. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fire inside of me burns so hot it's searing the life out of me and the dark unknown of the world is so vast It may have swallowed me and my hopes inside its cold belly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn other words. I don't feel good and I would like some help. Maybe some advice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n English is not my native language please bear with me for the sloppily formed sentences and the word choice.\n\nLove you all, \n\nA sick, mad and tired ENFJ\n\n&#x200B;
7	That sounds like you have a lot going on in your life. Rest and internet friends are not likely to be able to much to help you. Talk to your parents if you have nobody else and ask for help.  Go to a school counselor if available and if you are regularly having any thoughts of harming yourself or others please seek help immediately. \n\nDo not handle this alone and get the help you need, future you will thank you. 
6	Life is a rollercoaster, my friend, and everyone's experience is different. I know that may sound cliche, and this advice may not help at all, but it's good to have people to talk to. This year has bruised you, and It's going to take time to heal before you can completely re-assess yourself. \n\nTry making a change in habit. Disconnect the video games (or play for a set time). Get those classes out of the way, and try to reach some of your peers to help if you lose focus (happens all the time, there's no shame in it). Decide how you want to live, not what you want to be seen like, and lose contact with those who aren't loyal or worth compassion. \n\nI hope this helps you wherever it can.\n
6	At 20, you are in a very transitory and busy time in your life (and also are at that age where suicide risk is extremely high). \n\nWork on mindfulness and stress-reducing techniques. You can deal with all of life's ups and downs without being so stressed out. You can be an achiever without whipping yourself as motivation.\n\nThings will get better. You will never have to do last year again. Just work on enjoying the good things that come and reducing your every day anxiety.
2	his was fucking relatable
3	yea a counselor will do you much good.  honestly this is a lot to handle on your own and you should definitely reach out to your family about this. 4 hrs isn't a lot imo for video games, as I spend maybe 6 hrs playing video games every day and this is after college and I am working a full time job.  You shouldn't even be thinking about having a relationship because you're in a tough spot now and depending on someone else for your happiness is not the way to go.  You seem to be describing something close to depression, so again, see a counselor about this.\n\nFriendships take time to form and you need to consistently get to know someone. One hang out here and a chat there builds up over time and then you can form those close relationships.
2	Dear Sick, Mad & Tired ENFJ \n\nI somewhat understand where you're coming from finding yourself in a dark out where you can see the light & want to get out but are somehow barely clawing to reach it. Keep trying, do not give up. "Rome wasn't built in a day" It's been a tough year but just remember that it can & will get better. If you're struggling to help yourself & can't rely on your friends then the family you trust, & hey even us strangers here on Reddit are more than happy to lend an ear! If you feel to your core that this is still too difficult an issue to overcome then find a professional to talk to. I've been there. So many people have, sometimes it really is the best way. Self improvement though, take baby steps, I don't care if it's the teeniest tiniest step you feel you can take, anything is an improvement. That light you're looking for will be there waiting for you, it's not going anywhere. But first things first, YOU are first. 
2	Hey.\n\nTry to improve your assertiveness. Build a shield against stress from external sources.\n\nStop putting so much pressure on yourself.\n\nStop demanding so much from yourself, you're going to break.\n\nAs an ENFJ you may need someone to help you structure your life. We are very good at helping others, but not ourselves.\n\nFind good people with a healthy dose of Te. I'd recommend ISTJs.\n\nBye.
1	Okay, first of all, I’m proud of you for seeking the truth. The truth is sobering and painful and sad. It’s like taking the red pill in the matrix. You can never go back. You realize how fucked up the world is and how a lot of people are selfish or apathetic to others’ suffering or both. \n\nSo number one, good on you for breaking out of the fake reality that the majority of the world lives in. That is a hard choice. \n\nNumber two: because you want to be okay, you eventually will be.  You can choose to be kind to others despite the evil you know about and the new found knowledge of the crappiness and insincerity of the world. YOU can make a difference in a another human’s life. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been sad and a smile from a stranger has given me new hope in humanity, just because someone was kind or selfless for no reason, without receiving anything themselves. \n\nSo don’t give up. Know that with a deeper knowledge of the evil of the world comes a deeper respect for the good in the world, and there is a lot of good in the world, despite everything that is truly wrong with it. \n\nThings will get better as long as you keep seeking truth and keep loving others. I’ll pray for you my friend. Hang in there <3 
1	Rock bottom is a good place to start. You have to empty your glass of water in order to refill it. You can't become a fully integrated man otherwise. Life -among other things- is constant pain. Embrace it. Get acquainted with it. Adversity will cleanse your body and mind like fire removes rust from iron. It's your own ritual of ascension by which the boy inside you will die for the man you are to live. Every man worth his salt on the face of this earth has been subjected to this process. It's a blessing in disguise really.\n\nJust make sure to take proper care of yourself starting off from your diet, the way you rest and the way you train. Have a look at my comment history about diet + workout tips. After 10 years you will be looking back to this point in time and wonder why you were ever even worried in the first place. Ascend.
28	ENFJs and failiure	How do you deal with failiure? I’m an ENFJ and I always feel like I’ve let all my close ones down and I just want to disappear until I feel like I’m accepted again. Not that they say I’m not accepted, I just feel like becoming invisible and being alone for a decade :)\n\nEdit: a letter
12	THIS IS ME
8	Honest reflection identifying root causes to negative behaviors, re-evaluation, then action. Avoiding friends, give them a call. Poor performance at work, develop a strategy and give it 100%. Tackle your issues head on. Also admit your mistakes, many times people are afraid of negatively assessing themselves and would rather not admit their mistakes in front of people. Reconciliation is the way forward. That should be wedded into every plan you develop, part of every goal. There can be no change without admitting your mistakes, first to yourself and then to others. It will raise your self esteem, allow you to be validated, gain support and to re-emerge and ready to take on the world and thrive! Failures are an important part of learning, inaction will leave you lingering in it for too long. People need ENFJs, your friends and family do appreciate you and need you in their lives. Your positive attitude will uplift others. Break the spell and rise up!!\n\n
6	I usually get angry at myself for failing and then i go for a jog or lift some weights untill i reach a peaceful state of mind and then i will reflect to see what i can improve next time
2	I don’t deal with failure well. If something doesn’t turn out how I visioned then it seems like a failure to me and I get anxious about it. I have to resort to meditation, making a plan, and improving on the next try. 
6	I (Infp) would like a mentor (Enfj) for my dating life.	So I am truly stuck and looping with myself about love and dating. I have never before felt this clueless about how to date. I just need someone to talk about this subject and as far as people whispers go you are pretty good. I think talking with some of you would help me see what I missing. I don't know what I can offer to you but I would really appreciate some help. 
6	What’s going on? You spill it, I’ll try and help! 
5	ENFJ here for ya 
4	ENFJ here! How can I help?
5	 **\*Queue sad music\*** \n\nNow that I have your undivided attention:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLittle background info is that I am 24 year old female. I would say my looks aren't the problem but also wouldn't say that they make it too easy for me.  I have had only one long-term rocky relationship with an ISTJ. I was immature but he was aslo really harsh on me. I got really anxious and insicure in the relationship. For me it was first love and as I latter came to know for him it wasn't really a big love has he said it to a friend.  So lot of hurt and so on..... it's been 1 year since the break up. I heald myself real good tho. I have dabble in the dating for like 3-4 months now.  So here are some issues I have been having: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1)Right now my only mean to get a date is to use Tinder or other online dating sites.  I am not in the deep end of introversion but I am shy. Also most of my friends are geeky introverts  :D while we do go out for drinks occasionally we aren't very friendly looking bunch.  Tinder is hit and miss.  Also flaky and I am not really looking for hook ups.  I must say I have met really nice people from there but rarely a person I feel attracted to. There was this ENFJ that I was and still am really attracted to and we were  intimate but after that most of my attempts to spend time togheter are unfertile.  How  to meet people ?  How to strike a conversation with a new person on a random event/place that is light and comfortable?   \n\n\n2) I really don't want to be used and I don't want to use other just to not be lonely. So I am scared of dating and opening up. I want to... but I clam up and keep things surface level. So much that when I met a awesome person that said he liked (for me it was to intents and fast because it was on the 5th date) me I just said no..... even though I think there is so much potential and I do like him. Now he doesn't really talk to me anymore just some chit chat here and there. Last time when we hanged out I did want hug or just lean on him but I was more anxious than usually and I felt uncomfortable. How to I show someone that I like them ? Telling this is too  much because I said no and I want to take it slow.  But yeah I feel he as lost interest so I don't know if i should try to make some moves or not. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3)I think lot of issues stem from my lack of/low self esteem.  I know for a fact that I am a good person but I don't feel it.  I feel that it would be hard for some one to love me.  Maybe it's self fulfilling prophecy but it's hard when at age 24 I never felt love from another person  in a realationshipy way. I don't know what to even ask in  this part.... I don't know how to change this  : / \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt got little sappy in the end but I happy that I got this out. If you want to ask any additional question I am happy to reply. Also English is not my first language so sorry for any typos I tried to make it neat and tide.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
4	Enfj !
3	Here to help 
3	1) I would recommend trying bumble, coffee meets bagel, and just going out in general. Tinder to me is a hit it and quit it app. As an introvert, you can't really go out and meet strangers as easily because of the drain in energy it is.  I'd recommend going out with your friends to meet other people who are friends of friends.  In terms of light conversation, just say hi and throw a topic you enjoy talking about.  I personally like to throw shows, video games, boardgames and personal interests to see what hooks their attention.  Don't push yourself too hard in this department though.\n\n2) It's impossible to avoid the bad seeds and experiences when it comes to dating.  Mostly because it's a risk on all things.  You meet someone to get to know them, and to do that, you need to make yourself vulnerable.  Believe me, 5 dates is more than enough to know if you're interested in someone. At that point, the person is showing vulnerability by telling you how they feel.  You have to be able to communicate your thoughts and intents clearly for them to understand.  This is what it means to set boundaries.  Use words to convey you are still interested, but are having trouble opening up because you are scared.  It also is very important to take initiative too, because nobody likes things to be too one sided.\n\n3)\nYou need to work on yourself by meditation.  Thinking positive thoughts and telling yourself you're doing well actually goes a long way because after a while, you'll believe what you're telling yourself.  Relationships is not the answer for happiness despite what media portrays it to be.  It's kind of ironic because when you want to find someone, you won't find them. While when you don't look for them, then they find you.   If you have low self esteem while you're single, it's not going to magically get better once you find someone because you'll become dependent on them for affirmation/validation (that should come from within yourself).  To develop this self esteem takes a lot of willpower and doing things that help you feel fulfilled in the long run.  Being independent, helping others, and enjoying your time with your friends.\n\nRelationships take a long time and work to maintain.  People see others in relationships always being happy and fine, but don't see the fights/conflict resolutions that happen behind the scenes.\n
3	Give us more details, what has/hasn't worked? Do you seem to have a type?
3	Feel free to pm.
2	Careful, those enfjs are an infps ideal match...  you might end up dating your mentor. 😘
14	A broken enfj?	Been going through lots of mood swings lately but stuck to a certain pattern for years.\n\nI always thought due to my friendly nature and my “oh well fuck it” about being open because im an infj nature.\n\nI wonder about the concept of personality and wonder if im not truly an infj, but rather a broken enfj.\n\n1. I’m still bubbly, but thats just without thinking.\n2. I have urges to help my coworkers, but im telling them to fuck off (especially newbies)\n3. I was more bright and open when i was younger.\n\nNow im more of “prove to me that you deserve my kindness”\n\nI still behave bubbly, but now its all like prove to me you deserve her then you can play with the kind person that is in here.\n\nNot sure if im an infj or an enfj that is broken or maybe an enfj that has an alter to protect itself indiscriminately.\n\nStranger thing is i develop to enjoy cause suffering because well why care didn’t deserve you.\n\nTried talking to fellow infjs about it but they are too scared to constructively talk and bash on my fury. Wondering what you guys think \n\nor \n\nmust we follow society’s system. “ kill anyone that is different”
5	You sound like an ENFJ with a tendency to get stuck in a Ti grip.
3	Have you had any traumtic events that up happened? Something that might have caused a change in your personality?
-1	Hitler was an Enfj :P
1	Silent treatment	How long do you *more specifically the women* tend to keep the silent treatment going? 
14	I am an enfj married woman.\n\nI know that when I am suffering from silent treatment that it hurts physically - no appetite, can't sleep well, abdominal pain, heartache... etc. So I never give someone the silent treatment.\n\nInstead, I tell the person the truth or my feelings, and be genuine. The silence that happens after that is from the person not wanting to accept the truth or that their intentions were not perceived as intended and don't know how to go forward. I leave them be until either I can say something positive to them or they come around. I hope my waiting for their response isn't seen as silent treatment.\n\nEdit: beginning
4	I'm a man but I would never stop communicating and a lack of communication is one of my greatest fears
3	I can keep it up for about 15 minutes. Then I break and tell them everything that is going on in my mind! 
13	Making decisions based on gut feelings while knowing there is a more logical option.	I’ve noticed that I tend to make decisions off gut feelings instead of logic. In many cases, I am aware of the more rational decision, but tend to convince myself that my gut feeling is right.\n\n\n* I play a lot of boardgames, and tend to make moves I like while ignoring optimal moves. For example, when playing Chess, I have a tendency to move pawns in front of my king, even when it’s quite obvious that doing so is dangerous.\n\n* When playing Battle Mode in Mario Kart, I was fond of finding high ground and surrounding myself with bananas.  This was a terrible strategy because it took too long, and the bananas were easily destroyed.\n\n\n* I eat out a lot because I don’t feel like cooking. It ends up taking more time and energy because of the time needed to walk to the restaurant and wait for the food. And I rarely feel like calling ahead to save time.\n\n\n* When cooking, I have a tendency to throw stuff in the pan. I hate following recipes even though I know they will make the food better. On a daily basis, I don’t like following written instructions, even when I know it will save time.\n\n* I don’t like buying stuff online and go out of my way to visit brick-and-mortar stores. This is not a rational decision when factoring the cost of the subway ride and the extra time,\n\n\nIs this a typical ENFJ trait?
7	gut feelings are a thing I do myself. but i do like cooking and like to eyeball ingredients while following a recipe.  Amazon is basically godsend for me and makes things super convenient for when I need something.\n\nWhat you do doesn't correlate with MBTI, as MBTI explains how you think and process things. Most of the things you listed are more of a preferential thing than a personality thing.
3	just budding in to say maybe this is your way to manifest your risk taking OR self destructing side. maybe you’re not allowed to take risks when it comes to others or your job so you let it out on day to day things. \n\nOr as i like to see the good in everything, look at it this way: going out for food or buying stuff from actual shops also means interacting with sales people and being surrounded by others. Going there can be relaxing and entertaining in itself, observing people on the street / subway and checking things out.\n\nNot paying close attention to the recipe and feeling good just throwing things in - and playing games in different ways sounds like you have a lot of hidden creativity or a very strong, deep rooted need to do things in your distinct way. \n\nMaybe this is your subconscious telling you to go on an adventure of sorts. Not necessarily a trip (though that could be good) but maybe just a soul adventure.\n\nI mean if these are all things you just do that you can’t really explain maybe the answer is also there in the subconscious.\n\nI would suggest paying close attention to what you dream at night. If you wake up and still remember write it down somewhere and try to interpret it later :) I think you just need to connect with yourself \n\nBonus, here’s a very cheesy line i like: Gut feelings are guardian angels.\n\nThat doesn’t mean they’re irrational or illogical. It could be your intuition working for you. 
16	Feeling lost in trying to find a career path	This could also just be me and have nothing to do with my ENFJ nature, but I'm 34 and struggling with trying to find direction with work. I keep ending up taking "entry level" graphic design jobs because it's what I can always get hired at, the problem is these jobs never have room for growth and always pay at the lower end of the spectrum.  I understand the low paying graphic design thing is pretty much a separate discussion. \n\nHowever, the reason it affects me more though is because I also struggle every day feeling like I'm wasting all my potential being stuck at a desk working away designing some map or something similar for 6 hours straight, when I could be out doing work dealing with people, talking and interacting, leading meetings, something where I could shine as the outgoing people person I am.  \n\nThen there's the flip side, where people say "just learn code dawg" and get paid so you can afford to do whatever you want in your free time. Majority of my male friends all have taken this route and now code, and now have well paying jobs, get to work remote, all seem happy. So there's a lot of merit to that. And it sounds appealing to be able to learn code and get paid WELL for your efforts. Especially when I work as hard and long as some coders on graphic or production design projects and get paid peanuts and then watch my design go help make some million dollar sale. ( I don't understand why graphics are so low compensated, it's such a slap in the face). \n\nI just worry if I go the programming route, that I'm going to have the same reflecting struggle, "am I wasting my potential by locking myself to sitting a desk and not being out and about working with people?" Will it be less of a worry if I'm getting compensated better? Probably. It's just I'm at this crossroads that I can't seem to figure out how to get past, but I have to choose soon. \n\nIf no more design, and not learning code, how do I get into people facing roles without going back to school? I thought about being a recruiter, but I've heard it's super long hours and HORRIBLE work/life balance, also shit pay at the start since it's basically a sales job. I would love to work in HR, give orientation meetings, work with new hires and current employees, and be an open door for the people of a company. I've always felt that would be a good fit for me, but seems like one needs a degree for that, maybe a certificate can get by?\n\nSorry for wall of text, and thank you so much if you stayed to read it all even if it sounded a bit "vent-y"\n\nTL;DR: I am so tired of having to take desk jobs to make ends meet, and feel like i'm losing myself by not being able to get out and work with people directly instead. \n
6	I completely understand this.  I thought i wanted to work with Kids and help the community as a social worker, It left me completely burnt out and the majority of my day was spent in traffic or alone, the only human interaction would be with the little kids (which I loved).  I fell into a huge depression from the isolation and had to quit for my own sanity.  I ended up getting a desk job and was an errand girl for a real estate company.  Again I was usually alone and felt very disconnected from my workplace since no one really talked to me.  Now I find myself working at a distribution company as a Clerk, where i have to work a Customer service window, answer phone calls, have really sweet coworkers and a Computer to do my daily data entry.  I'm not making what I wish I was making, but the job is enjoyable and Im hoping to eventually move up or take what I've learned somewhere else.  I think its important to find a job that caters the your needs and not just gets you money with zero satisfaction.  I enjoy working at a desk but I'm also providing customer service and can talk to people all day.  Good luck out there
5	I’m also mid 30’s and am completely lost in my career direction. I had a job I loved but my shoulder wouldn’t let me do it any longer. Now I’m desperately searching for something that will make me happy and make me money. You’re not alone in this.
3	I’m waiting tables until I’m in a position to get my masters in counseling. Waiting tables gives me the ability to make lots of people smile every day as well as good enough money to save for school. Earning my Counseling certification seems to be the only thing that fits my ENFJ dreams. I imagine a lot of you may feel the same way. 
3	I'm sorry that you're having a hard time. It sounds like you're really struggling with this. And while I don't have all the right answers, I figured that sharing my take might be helpful here. I'm 24 and doing pretty well for myself relative to others my age (financially and career-wise) . And while that's...been something important for me to accomplish, I too, share the same desire for something greater. Specifically, something that involves helping other people and creating change, somehow.\n\nI don't know if I have any specific advice, here, but...what has helped me get where I am so far has been 70% planning and 30% luck. I'm in marketing and my first job spurred an internal crisis for me. We're idealists, which...can be a double edged sword. I value merit but I quickly noticed that those around me, who had succeeded, had the gift of gab and manipulated their way through relationships to the top. Obviously, as an ENFJ, this realization hit me hard. I didn't want to sell out my values, yaknow? Be fake, inauthentic. But I quickly realized that I too shared the gift of gab and persuasion. The difference is - I had simply...refused to use it strategically. I've had a wake up call since; and have realized that - success involves leveraging people and relationships. And I love people! So, why not leverage this strength? Wherever you go, forming relationships will help you get ahead. \n\nAs will having a plan. Apathy is bad - and sadly, I've noticed it in those around me who never seem to have much going on. They exude a sense of resolve, like...this is it and they have no control over their destiny. That this is just what life is. And yet, this is why looking ahead and having a vision is important. A clear one. There are SO many jobs out there, many that will surprise you. Not all coding jobs are sitting at a desk (total nightmare). I suggest that you look around at job listing, focusing on opportunities that reflect that right balance between autonomy and working with others. We might not save the world, but...big isn't always the point. Instead, maybe you'll end up  talking a coworker through something difficult or teaching and mentoring others as a manager or specialist. \n\nSome days, I feel like my job isn't what I'm meant to do. At least this one. And that's okay, because - I get my fix in other ways. Volunteering, making friends at work, etc. So, find hobbies that feel purposeful to you. There's always time - so use it to figure out what you actually want to do. 
3	About 85% of the people in my Master of Library Science were enfj. Want to be a librarian? Read about what it's like in 2018 (not at all the stereotypes) and maybe think about it? Suits us well.\n\nEdit: its  master of library and information science program. Sorry for the error, speed be damned.
3	Damn this hit me. I'm 25F and I kept switching between engineering and med. I'm trying to be a PA and the route is a little longer but hey why not try. Maybe read into a few books like Principles by Ray Dalio or Starting with Why by Simon Sinek?\n\nIf you are really lost is it a life crisis? Can you afford therapy? \n\nThere was a thread on Reddit a while ago called [What is a great career path that kids in college are unaware that it exists?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5513aq/serious_what_is_a_great_career_path_that_kids_in/)  Maybe looking into this too can help give you ideas? \n\n
2	I'm sorry you're going through this. I don't really have any advice but I want you to know that you being self-aware and knowing what you want is a great direction. From that start alone, things will work themselves out with the path you take and the passion you hold. I'll share my experience:\n\nI switched out a medical program that I was far into recently because I was't being true to myself. I'm glad I could be honest and make the decision to get out of that stress and anxiety but it made me confused as to what kind of career I wanted. That too, I let go of a career where I would be given the opportunity to help people and earn well from it. But...it was just too much for me.\n\nA few weeks later, I decided to pursue business administration w/ a concentration in marketing. I wanted to interact with people and realized that we are strong communicators and have the potential to grab an audience. It just felt natural to be where my strengths lied. However, I'm not even sure what the end goal is. Maybe an HR manager? Maybe a hospital administrator? Maybe an advertising executive? I'm just grabbing whatever internships are around and trying to make the most of it because I'm behind from spending my time in medicine. My biggest fear is that I'll lose the drive and passion I've built up just like I did in medicine and fall to my own idealism. I just hope it works out and I get that satisfaction and success I've been craving for so long.\n\nI wanted to share my experience because I know how exhausting it can feel of not meeting the potential you know you have. I spent most of my time attending interest meetings, conferences, and simply talking to my friends about it. One thing I learned is that people want to help and will open more paths. I have an interview with Merrill Lynch whose chief of recruitment never went to college and started out working for the company because he knew some people. But because of that opportunity, he was so passionate in giving an interview to whoever reached out with a resume and a date. It doesn't matter if you go to college or anything - what matters is knowing your strengths and having a plan on capitalizing on them.\n\nI know this wall of text may not have given a proper response but I know you will accomplish great things if you follow what you want and have a vision for yourself.
1	So I am in the middle of my job search right now. As an ENFJ I was always pissed by my suggested career paths. None of it was what I wanted to do but everyone in grade school told me that's what I should go into since it matched my personality type. \n\nNow that I am in business/data analysis I have found a way to take a career path that most places say an ENFJ would struggle and I make it work for me. The reason it works is that I am able to tick off all my boxes for a desired job; continual learning, problem solving, and above all helping people. \n\nIf you are struggling to figure out what you want to do I would suggest you do some soul searching first. If you go into a job for the wrong reasons you will ultimately make yourself unhappy. There is a book that really helped me when I started out - 'What Color is Your Parachute'.  There some really good segments and activities that help you to find your path without being too preachy. \n\nI hope that you end up doing something that you enjoy and that you can find joy in
9	ENFJ I have a question for you	Do you guys get distant when you are going through transitions in your life? Do you ever snap at your partner? If you tell that person that you can't talk because you "cant be there in the way you want me to be" do you still come back? Especially when you had a really deep connection with someone you were with?
8	Distant, yes sometimes but not for long. Time spent with loved ones is too important to me. Sometimes I'm distant because I'm worried & don't want people to worry about my worrying so I shush myself a bit. Other times maybe I'm just emotionally overwhelmed. I get in my head a lot & can sometimes over think things so I need time to process it alone but I almost always will jump at the first opportunity I let myself have to go back to my normal self. I love my family & friends far too much to be gone from them too long. 
2	Quiet signs of support should help. 
2	Speaking as an ENFJ male here.\n\nYes. Just need to recalibrate. Though I try to never let it get to a point where I "snap".  My last relationship 2 years ago failed because I felt I was struggling through a transition and dived into a relationship before getting my life stabilized. I'm still working on things in fact, but I was able to get a leg up on my transitional time. Took me a year to recalibrate, but that was due to my job and relationships both falling out at the time. But part of me deeply regrets not being able to be the man I wanted to be when I was with my ex. Emotionally, financially, mentally, etc. I was so overwhelmed with being out of sync with life due to job woes, being out of shape, and super tight on money and trying to both keep up with my peers and grow in a relationship. It all came crashing down.\n\n However after realizing that last year I realized that I didn't need my ex back, but more so that I was able to date again after I stabilized, got a stable job, got back on track in the gym, etc. Still working on finances but I'm optimistic. \n\n
1	Long ago I mastered creating distance, but still remaining connected. Idk if it was death, abandonment, or just life pooping all over me. I've been known to lay down the exact line "can’t be there in the way you want me to be"  \n\nThe one bone that I was born without was the snapping bone. That just doesn't happen. I implode on myself when the partner, family, or friend leaves the area. I am my own worse critic and I evaluate every action I took to get myself into the position I am in (even if that is not my fault). My advice would be "hang in there. Don’t give up on this ENFJ. I have been that disconnected person many times, and in my case it was a cry for help in one area or another. As someone else said, quiet signs of support means the world."\n
1	yea i honestly dont' think it'll work out between you two and you aren't ready for a relationship right now.  The past posts you've described your situation and want more than what we can really provide you.  All the things you mentioned aren't an ENFJ "thing" and we can't really explain your ENFJs thoughts, intentions and reasons behind what he does.  Not all ENFJs are the same and the level of dependancy I'm seeing between you two is unhealthy.  It's been a month since this all started and you aren't any better off now than you were when you first posted about his ghosting issue.  \n\nNo matter how much you ask the same questions over and over, it just feels like you only want to be told what you want to hear and aren't truly listening to the responses here.  Like I don't want to be mean, but the reality is, this guy isn't making you happy, he's not clear with his communication, you are clinging way too much to a guy you've known for less than 3 months.  You clearly aren't in a good spot right now either.  I feel for you and know how much it hurts to like someone so much, only for them to not reciprocate as you would like.  It's not mature to ghost someone you've expressed interested in dating, but it's also very unhealthy to harass the guy when it's clear he's not responsive.  Coming back and being distant like that is also a big sign that it won't be a healthy relationship.  Then coming to a subreddit for a month seeking answers from complete strangers to further get information on the guys' thoughts is also not the way to go.  We ENFJs are helpers and we do share our concern/sentiments.  However, this is something we can't help you with as we can't do nor say anything that will help you feel better about your situation.  Because what you really want right now is for the guy to maintain proper communication, reciprocate your feelings and expectations, and to simply affirm/validate your needs.  That's something we can't give you.
38	I don't like my birthday...	I don't know if this is an ENFJ thing or not but when my birthday comes around I get anxiety. I don't like the thought of everyone singing to me or everyone giving me gifts or of having a party— I love doing that on other people's birthdays. Just not on my own.\n\nI know I worry about what face I make when I open a gift, wanting to give the reaction people expect. I worry about what everyone else will be feeling on my birthday. I worry about having to choose my birthday meals (I still live at home and this is a tradition and in the past when I have tried to tell them I don't care what we eat, they have gotten upset which I didn't want at all).\nMy birthday stresses me out. I hate saying what I want because I don't even know, and would rather do what everyone else wants. \n\nCouldn't we skip my birthday? \n\nHave you ever felt this way? How did you handle it? \n\n
14	I can completely relate to this.\n\nThe more I look at this subreddit, the less of a freak I feel like lol.\n\nOne thing I want to point out though--YOU enjoying your birthday makes other people happy as well.\n\nDon't forget that there's a person inside of you--yourself--who needs to treated well and taken care of. When you look out for that person, you'll appreciate others even more.
8	I also get super anxiety for my birthday because I do like attention and always secretly hope there's a surprise waiting for me.  These days though, instead of expecting people to throw parties for me, I just host my own birthday party and enjoy my time with my friends.  My boyfriend doesn't see the point of birthdays (he's INFP) and so requests for his birthday to be as lowkey as possible or to be treated like a regular birthday.\n\nThis is more for me to feel validated and affirmed of my existance.  If people remembered my birthday, then that would mean they care.  However, I don't really have that mindset anymore and I'm pretty happy with or without a birthday. I use to dread my birthday because if nobody remembers than my existance was unimportant, but now I make it a day to celebrate hanging out with my friends and enjoying my time with family.
4	Yup I feel similar. No idea why either! One thing that really helped was privating my birthday on Facebook. It doesn't make me sad, just relieved. I'd rather only my close friends and family knew, and this reduces my anxiety. I hope it helps you too :) 
5	Fellow enfj here! Birthdays are awkward for me as well! The past couple years I just focus on doing what everyone else wants to do to celebrate because I'm happiest when the people I love are happy. Also it relieves that birthday stress of imagining your perfect birthday even in the simplest of forms & being disappointed. I too worry about what faces I'm making! 
5	Yup! I have a holiday birthday, so I just play it off as "Can't compete with the holiday! Oh well!". 
4	I thought it was just me - never considered it may have been a shared trait among fellow ENFJs! One year my well-meaning (ESFP) sister threw me a surprise party and I feel guilty saying that it was a slightly traumatic experience. I had always preferred to keep my birthday low key before that, but since that year, as you can imagine, I've really struggled with finding the right way to celebrate my birthday, if at all. I often catch myself thinking "what do my family/friends want/expect for my birthday" before I even ask myself what I want to do. Definitely interested to hear what others have done to minimize the bday anxiety.
4	I was born on Christmas eve, and in Mexican culture the 24th is basically Christmas.  So I've never actually had much attention on me.  I don't particularly mind it though I usually sneak off and watch a movie in my PJ's
5	Oh god what’s our problem? Ahahah I refused to celebrate my birthday till last year! \n\n\nMy solution was to celebrate it with my So + other friends: last year was really cool and I didn’t have to worry about the “presents face”, i feel you so much about it! Years ago I freaked out because I didn’t know who to invite and when I was about to choose I felt guilty about other people. Sharing the day is a great way to celebrate it I swear! 
5	I always loved my birthday cause as a kid it meant presents and family and as an older teen it meant I was closer to being 18. On my 18th birthday I was over the moon, especially since I could now make my own medical decisions and sign off on all the paperwork I needed to move out. Not sure how I will feel about my 19th now that I've accomplished everything I wanted to accomplish by now. 
3	Be learned to really love and enjoy it. I love being alive so that helps. Celebrate me! I try to force myself to feel like a kid on my birthdays. 
3	I don’t feel anxious, but I don’t really care. I do show gratitude when my wife does something for my bday though!
3	Yes!
2	Absolutely. I hate the attention it draws. I'd rather spend it with my family. Not even friends cause I know they tend to go overly the top\n\nMy birthday is soon and I love how I stumbled on the post. Reminds me that there's others out there who are similar to me! I haven't celebrated my birthday extravagantly in years and I don't feel ways or care
2	I was just thinking about this last night and was trying to get to the bottom of why I feel this way. \n\nLOL, yes. I don't like my birthday and never have. I just...don't care about it. I hate the attention, the gifts, the just...all of it. I usually try to hide it at work, only to have my close friends blow the whistle; and then I have to cringe all day as randoms come up to me and put on me the spot.\n\nMy hypothesis is...that I don't like birthdays because they feel so artificial. Like, it's not like we can CONTROL when it is, let alone being born. So, why am I being praised so darn much for something I had zero input on?! Also, why are people so much nicer to you on your birthday when they should be that way to everybody, EVERYDAY, yaknow? 
2	i hate birthdays too! especially prepping for the fake face when opening gifts.\nbest birthday gift at the office this year was my coworkers pretending it wasn’t my birthday and didn’t do anything special.......wait. maybe they actually forgot.. wtf >:( jerks
1	What happens when an enfj gets mad.	im trying to figure out who i am. I feel like im on the border between the two ( common)\n\nbut i would to know what happens if you get mad someone, group or both
20	Not an ENFJ, but I’m in a relationship with one. There’s a high threshold, but when it’s reached they know what to say to really cut you to the core. It can be pretty brutal but it’s also very rare. 
9	I keep it in because I hate conflict but then it just ends up coming out sooner or later in other ways that I am unhappy about something. If we are speaking true anger, then yes, there is a very high threshold, but if someone antagonizes me to that point they better be prepared to hear it from me. I raise my words as well as my voice. Strap in.
5	I rarely get mad as an ENFJ, but if I do it's something to really have pushed me to a point. And when I do I feel like [it's kind of like this](https://media1.tenor.com/images/08e2fdb43e9077437da2045a6e3d1573/tenor.gif?itemid=11531444).
5	My best friend is an ENFJ and she's... uh... small but mighty! It's pretty much what everyone here said. She's the most loving and understanding person I know. She doesn't get upset over silly things. I've only seen her angry about a wrong being done to her a handful of times. Usually when she gets angry, it's because of an injustice or because someone has wronged a person she cares about. And when that happens... step aside and watch out. Cutting words and angry tears. 
3	It takes a lot but I am so conflict avoidant that I don't like to give my instant reaction. I like to go away, analyse, deal with the initial emotion and then decide how to react to the individual.\n\nSometimes that's enough for it to dissipate and I decide no reaction is required, but I never forget. \n\nIf it becomes a recurring thing you're gonna hear about it in a cool, collected way that makes it absolutely clear why you've made me angry and what I expect to happen.\n\nI don't mean to sound entitled by saying that, it's just how I handle things or it'll simmer into resentment and that ends the relationship swiftly.\n\nBasically, if I'm quiet and you mistake it for sadness, it is the calm before the potential storm. 
3	I agree with all the statements here. I'm incredibly patient and tolerant and I can't remember very many times in my life where I've been truly angry. When I do though, it's like a volcano erupting. I wouldn't be surprised if there were laser beams coming out of my eyes. HardCorwen's meme summed it up pretty well. It really is fascinating how we can be the epitome of love and kindness but yet have such potent rage.
2	I'm very forgiving, too forgiving really; but once I get pushed past a certain point, look out! I can be very nasty. Also, if I get to the ultimate breaking point, I will never forget. I might seem to have forgiven, and I don't dwell on it, but that person will never have the same place in my heart that they once did. 
1	I don't get mad often. Even mild disagreement can cause my more sensitive friends to recoil backwards with apologies, so I rarely even need to get angry anyways (just ruins relationships and wastes energy). When it happens, it's usually over some kind of huge moral outrage (like a customer mistreating workers at a fast food establishment) and I decide I'll confront them, decide on what I'll say, and then go hard and fast. I almost always get my way immediately, but I'm good at walking away and letting the group of people around us handle that person (some how I always get strangers to stick up for me and help me out). 
1	Like everyone else said here, the threshold is really, really high for me (I'm a middle school teacher, I have patience for DAYS). I give a lot of cues that I'm reaching my breaking point. My ex-husband was the type who would keep picking at me "logically" and ignored me when I would tell him I was at my limits. When I lost it, I lost it bad. He would love to tell me that I was mentally unstable because the few times I went off, I held nothing back. I would say the meanest, ugliest shit, because I felt cornered and it was the only way I could protect myself. He, on the other hand, was constantly angry or annoyed. I compared us to a kettle vs. a pot with the lid on. He let off steam constantly, letting everyone know he was pissed, or irritated. I kept it all boiling under a lid until that lid flew off. I try to find peaceful resolutions, but if I'm not allowed the space to find them, I can't get to that place. I go into defense mode. When I get to that point, IDGAF about anyone else's feelings. I will say whatever I can think of to shut you up and leave me alone.
1	ENFJ Males: HALP, PLZ! XD	Ok, for those who have followed along w/my journey - an update: I’m now madly, deeply in love with my ENFJ. I realized it this week & cemented it internally last night. Note: I have never been in love and this is not a pleasant feeling. I would like it to stop but it keeps increasing, so I’m going to have to do something about it XD\n\nI’m not sure what to do about this because neither of us are in a place we can do much about it. We could put a label on whatever we are and add hanky panky but neither of us are in a financial state to be any more serious than that.\n\nAlso, I’m scared to ruin what we have if I’m wrong about any reciprocal feelings he may have. He’s had two major failed relationships (one within the last year) & two minors, so is very protective of his heart. He’s also, surprisingly, quite insecure. He’s early 20s but mature - I’m late 20s & super ridiculously immature. (I have pink hair & still wear hoodies & jeans in a place where all adults wear business attire)\n\nSo, here’s what’s been happening. ENFJ males, is this how you act with someone you love? (Yeah, I know I’m going to have to straight up ask him about his feelings but I just want to know if I have just cause before I do, lol)\n\n- we’ve officially combined businesses, which means our futures are locked in together forever. (We’re both in media. I write the words that he speaks and it’s literal magic together.)\n\n- we talk in some form everyday. He’s not a texter (he prefers voice) but will reply to mine immediately. If he doesn’t, he always explains why w/out needing to.\n\n- he said the words, “You are a priority.”\n\n- when we go anywhere together he is very attentive, getting me things, watching out & holding out his arm protectively so that I don’t run into poles or step in puddles or broken glass (oooooof, that’s what got me btw lol!). He buys me little practical gifts, like notebooks, that make my heart pitter patter.\n\n- last night we went to our usual weekly coffee shop meeting & I was hiding that I was upset about the last couple of weeks. (We’ve both been stressed. He’s yelled at me & done some things that kinda hurt. I feel like withdrawing but also getting closer - it’s a whole jumble of a mess of emotions brewing between us!) He could tell. We’d literally been there less than 10 minutes when he stood up & told me to grab my stuff. He didn’t even finish the things he ordered! I protested but he wouldn’t listen & said we were going to his place to talk. We get there, he’s doing his best jokes to lighten my mood. He tells me to sit on his bed & tell him what’s going on. I burst out crying XD ok, I am an INTP - not only do I NOT CRY IN FRONT OF ANYONE - I don’t cry AT ALL! That’s when I knew I loved him. I told him a few things and he comforted me. He then told me I was his closest friend & that I was the only one that had ever seen him at his worst. He then held his hand up & crossed his fingers. He made me do the same and said, “See this? This is us.” I smiled & he added, “Actually, I’m pretty sure this is a gang sign.” I laughed out loud & he broke into a full smile. I told him that I’d never had a friend last longer than two years & he said, “Well, I’m aiming for this to last a hell of a lot longer than two years and I hope you are, too.” I said that of course I was XD He then had to get dressed for a client meeting and made me sit there with my eyes covered, hahahhaa! I did NOT peek...but I wanted to :P he apologized for some of the things that had happened & said he wasn’t ashamed of me & I could publicly post anything about him from now on and he would not only ‘heart’ it but share it as well. (He knows social media is important to me but isn’t to him) He also pushed the hair out of my eyes & tucked it behind my ear & I melted, but that’s neither here nor there holycrapilovehim.\n\n- he’s EXTREMELY jealous of other guys in my life but tries to hide it. I am, too, w/the girls in his so I never tease him about it because that would kill me if he tried to make me jealous intentionally. He doesn’t. In fact, sometimes he OVER explains his relationships w/them lol!\n\n- he said, randomly, while getting dressed, “I want to go on dates. Nobody dates anymore! What’s wrong with the world?” “I agree!” “Right?” Awkward pause. Me, “Hey, you know WE can do more than just work stuff.” “Yeah, I agree. We went to the movies that one time but I don’t any like movies that are out.” “Yeah, but I’m a doer. I like to ‘do’ things.” “Same! We should do ‘not-work’ things sometimes.” \n\nSo, is there cause for exploring feelings? What does an ENFJ male need to feel secure? Does he need to make the moves? He is a for sure control freak alpha male, so I don’t wanna step on his toes. Do I need to plan dates? What do you guys like? I like go-karts & paintball but also jazz bars & (not seedy) burlesque shows. He’s never said, “No” anytime I’ve asked him to other things, so I have no idea what he actually likes lol!\n\n
4	Plan your dates, ask him what he wants and set boundaries/expectations.  I know it's exciting right now and you don't wanna mess anything up, but the fun part about dating is that you spend time together to get to know one another.  You gotta ask him what he likes.  Ask him these questions, us other ENFJs can't speak for him, not can we really speculate because we don't know him.  If I were to ask an INTP what you like, i'm pretty sure they may not share the same interests as you.
21	ENFJ Doctors?	Hello, I have always wanted to be a doctor and I am on the path to do so and will be applying soon. I never see doctor as a profession listed for ENFJs and I was wondering why? It seems like they would be a good fit due to their love of people. Any ideas as to why?  I have been getting nervous about applying and I was wondering if there are any other ENFJ doctors out there or if any one knows a good ENFJ doctor. Thanks all! 
8	I wouldn't sweat it. I'm a third year med student now (far from a doctor), and the ENFJ qualities have helped me work with patients as well as cope. There are a few things that are tough though... Like when you know what is best for someone and they are refusing it. But I think it's a great fit for ENFJs! Good luck!!!
8	ENFJ doctor reporting! Don’t let the MB determine what field you “should” or “shouldn’t” enter. The MB can provide insight into your strengths and weaknesses, but beyond that take it with a grain of salt. 
12	I’m an ENFJ guy who left an accelerated medical program a month back. We were doing all medical courses, surgery, emergency practice, the whole nine yards. I told myself that it was what I wanted to do because I love people and the social side of medicine but after being in the program for 2.5 years, it was torture for me.\n\nThe coursework wasn’t too difficult but you really have to be prepared to work under stress every single day. My biggest issue was how emotionally and mentally taxing it was. Every day was 8-5pm class, an hour to eat, studying from 7-2am, repeat. Being able to find a balance is crucial. You can’t get worried about failing because there’s always another exam coming up so you don’t have time to feel bad for yourself. You gotta keep going and stay motivated.\n\nNow, the healthcare model has changed in the US. Doctors have become more of administrators who handle less patient context than that of PAs, nurses, and NPs. That’s not to say doctors don’t spend time with patients because that would 100% false. As ENFJs, it can be overwhelming because medicine is unforgiving and can lead to a lack of lifestyle balance. It is also very rewarding but you have to know what you’re getting into. The doctors I know have told me that you really have to love science when it comes to being a doctor. There are bunch of other fields where you make more money for less work and have that social atmosphere ENFJs thrive in. I was honestly trapped and felt compelled to do it out of prestige, a hunger for success, fulfillment to help people, and the pride of working hard. \n\nBut I just didn’t feel connected to the material and i was too stubborn to let go of this vision when I started out. My director told me that I should consider staying another semester because I was on a roll but it was just too much to wake up with anxiety every day on when the next exam is and studying for at least 10 hrs a day. I felt like I was going crazy. It was only when I was honest with myself and assessed my strengths did I make the hardest and best decision. I’m now a business administration major where I’m able to use my communication and interpersonal skills to lead and connect with others. I have a passion and a natural aptitude for it and I feel that once you have a vision and are honest with yourself, you can do anything! Good luck on your path! Excited for you
5	Same boat as you!! Let’s do this!
5	I’m an enfj doc in the US. Unfortunately about 60% of my job is admin and documentation-data entry and charting and connecting things so that they get done. I spend a good amount of time reading and puzzling out my diagnoses and treatment plans, and precious little time actually talking to the patients. That said, I am in a hospital based specialty. Some specialties like primary care and psychiatry allow you more time with patients and over a longer period of time. Palliative care too. I will often stay late to spend more time with my patients which gives me much more enjoyment from my work but eats into my free time. It gets hard because the hours force you to compromise a lot in your personal relationships and doesn’t necessarily balance in time spent on patient relationships. It is definitely a sacrifice and isn’t easy (I’m working 80+ hours a week presently so my view is probably on the bleaker side) but that said I can’t imagine doing anything else. There are also lots of opportunities to teach as a doctor-especially in an academic institution-which I think fits enfjs well. 
3	ENFJ male here, senior in high school. Going for medical science (not completely sure which branch yet) and piano performance!! Good luck to both of us :)
7	Is social intelligence natural to ENFJ or do I know an ENFJ who's highly intelligent?	
15	I think our environments shape a lot of it. We’re naturally really good at understanding people and their emotions, but unlike ENFPs, we may not always get or care about the social expectations and ‘must-be-dones’. I know I envied my sister a lot growing up, cos she just understood how to be ‘cool’, and I worried more about whether it was fair for anyone to be cool, and all the emotions involved.\n\nSo if we’re around people that can see and value our emotional abilities, we tend to fit in pretty well. But if we make choices that are authentic but not societally accepted, maybe not (e.g. growing up different in a small town). But in the end, being able to make people feel understood tends to make them forget about the rest, or put it aside just a little more. \n\nJust my personal experience. 
5	I believe it’s more an enfj strength compared to others. Always exceptions
3	Por que no los dos?
3	Yep, definitely an ENFJ quality. They lead with Fe so they have a natural ability to gauge emotional interplay and social dynamics. I think this is true on a micro level when it comes to interpersonal relationships around them but also on a macro level when looking at social structures and patterns. Pretty sure this is also what’s behind their desire to be liked and accepted by people because they’re so plugged into the whole social system. 
1	ENFJs*
1	I think social intelligence is much more a way of think that comes really natural to ENFJs.
17	Married ENFJs	If you’re an ENFJ that’s married like I am, what MB type did you marry, and how long have you been married? What has your experience been like?\n\n(I married an ISTJ)
16	I’m an ENFJ and my husband is an INFJ. We have been married 4 years, together 10. It’s nice to have someone at home that understands my need for harmony and we both prefer a peaceful, quiet home to come back to and recharge in together.  It’s also nice to have someone in my corner who looks out for me and reminds me if I’m close to overextending myself. In return I help him relax and not be so hard on himself. We both encourage each other to improve ourselves and support each other’s goals.\n\nWe make a great team.
9	I married an ENFJ. She’s awesome, and nearly identical to me. We have a lot of fun together and our love for each other is wonderful!  We don’t fight (although we do get frustrated from time to time), and we communicate very well with each other. We have a great deal of patience for each other. We are compassionate to each other and mesh very well together. We’ve been married for a year but together for over three years. 
7	I married an INFP & we’ve been together for 8 years, married for 3. Our relationship is pretty laid back and very loving. We’ve always been drawn to each other and very comfortable together. We never get sick of being together but we are both fine with space and alone time. We had some struggles with areas that we didn’t understand each other in the beginning, but we took the time to figure each other out and ever since then it’s been pretty smooth sailing. 
6	I married an INFP.  We dated 8 years before we got married last November.  I'm so grateful for finding him when I did.  I had just come out of a very toxic relationship with an ESFP that was super damaging to my already fragil mindset.   He was always right there to listen to me and support me even when in my most difficult of times.  Since day 1 we have always been on the same wave length, We always try and respect each others thoughts and opinions and have  wonderful communication.  We also are good and making the other come a little out of their shell in either direction.  I'll get him to go enjoy moments outside of the house while he also plans very sweet and intimate dates. He's the love of my life and I never in a million years would have expected to be so happy.
6	I married an ISTP... I know what was I thinking!! lol. \n\nI have been married for 5 and together 9. I would be lying if I said I had and easy relationship however I do believe we have finally come to a good place with our understandings of each other. Hard parts are I want more time from him than he want's to give, I want to go out more than he does, I think of fun future things to do and he gets upset because he thinks of finances now.  But all those can be negotiated .\n\nI'm happy to have married someone so opposite from me because I think I have learned a lot about life from him. He brought me off my moral high horse that I was too attached to.  He is also a lot better at handling finances than I am and I'm grateful for the checks and balances he provides . Most importantly though, he let's me be myself, he does not expect things from me that aren't me. He doesn't try to change who I am or what I want to do with my life. I have the independence and freedom  to be me which I think is important for ENFJ's. 
2	I'm dating an ISTJ, and I'm curious how your experience is! 
2	I'm also married to an ISTJ wife! We've been together about 6 years and married for one of those years. We mesh very well and we don't often fight. Frustrations come from emotional communication and goal alignments, so the usual things for most couples. I'd say our challenge is that I'm a very full throttle person, so I need reminding to slow things down and include her. Ive had a lot to learn since I met her and I'm sure I have a lot more to learn. Still she's the first person to fully accept who I am and I can't imagine life without her.
1	That’s how it is for us as well! Some difference we’ve had to work through, some we are still trying to understand haha. But smooth for the most part!
1	I married an ENTJ 15 years ago. We're a powerhouse team. She has these big goals and wants to implement them with minions. I soften the harshness and get buy-in from affected parties, I make sure her plans are good for everyone. The project succeeds, she gets accomplishment, I get more friends.

7	That was so cute lol!!
2	Well, that was adorable. Wonder if there is an ENFP one?
2	My. Life. 
2	Wow I really related to these!! Thanks for sharing. It feels great to be an ENFJ :)
1	Question how do you get a / your ENFJ off his / her soapbox when they are wrong and making things so much worse but they are not listening for they have soap to sell?\n\nI ask what is the best way to get their attention and empathy back?  Because sometimes ***I am plotting murder*** for they are not listening and are making everything worse?
1	Cute!!\n\nI almost felt attacked by the superhero mode bit haha
9	What should I know about my ENFJ friend? (INTP/INFP)	
27	As a friend, reach out to them rather than waiting for them to reach out to you. ENFJs desire validation and inclusion but don't want to ask for it with fears of appearing needy. Don't be afraid to be yourself and be as goofy and open as you want to be because we love genuineness above all else. We always try to go the extra mile with friends and love to make them feel comfortable with us. As a result of us going above and beyond, we don't take criticism too well because we will question our actions and struggle to understand where we went wrong. Bottom line: we love people and having friends is the biggest sign of comfort for us
10	The ENFJ Care and Handling Manual\n\nhttp://foreveranevilregal.tumblr.com/post/142703715997/your-enfj-care-and-handling-user-guide-and-manual
7	We have so much on our hands and we may appear as strong, but appreciation and caring for us would go a loooong way into making us feel better and stronger in going on with life. We feel sad and weak sometimes, too. Just small gestures of love and care would already be highly appreciated! :) And just let us love you too! :)
7	Your friend doesn’t easily understand that other people don’t want to interact and engage them as often as they feel compelled to engage. ENFJs are also genuinely inclusive in nature, so we also have a penchant for drawing in as many people for activities as we can (I think it would be fun to find 80 people and go the midnight release of a movie together).\n\nTL;DR: we’re really socially overwhelming. We know this, and I would say, that most of us are ok with that and don’t care. We understand that we have a unique level of social energy not shared by many other MBTIs.
3	If you're an INTP: you know all that stuff you think about doing for or saying to other people but are too scared to cuz it'll make you look weak/vulnerable? Yeah, do all that stuff. They freaking LOVE it and will make you feel completely appreciated for it! (caveat: it HAS to be genuine. No fakey fakey nice stuff) It's very addicting for both parties :P 
4	Self destructive behaviour, always looking for impossible relationships, any help appreciated	Hi all!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think I'm a ENFJ 3w4 sx/sp - socionics Ni subtype (lol, guess I have read too much about psychological stuff).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm 34 yo and I always get obsessed with girls who are impossible to get (3 lesbians up untill now, 2 I believe were ISTP, the other ISFP, just as my mother).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think I need psychotherapy but I would like to know your opinions too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nParents divorced when I was 9, big fight and I stayed with my mother (ISFP), who cried once when my father went to look for me at my aunt and I rejected him because it would hurt my mother, since then I haven't talked with him (ENFJ I think) up until a few years ago.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI believe this might have something to do. Recently I started dedicating a song (stay by me) to a girl on facebook, my mother added my on facebook, and then she played that song in the house, which made me feel creepy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI put this background because I think this might have a lot to do with this, and I'm leaving my mothers house this december.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm really stressed right now, feeling like I might never find someone to be my life partner, something I really crave...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't know what else to say... I just got rejected again by a girl, she blocked me 5 times, I always though she was sending me messages through instagram/facebook indirectly, but that's something really creepy since I was stalking her. At this time, I also rejected 2 girls who were into me for this other girl who I was obsessed, even when she rejected me 5 years ago, 2 years ago, and now. I'm sick \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHelp
6	As an ENFJ you should have excellent self-control and be very aware of your own behaviour and that of others. So take an honest look at yourself, see what you need to change and improve. \n\nTo empathize with you, I will say that I was rejected recently by an INFJ and it hurt like hell. Now I'm searching for a more compatible person.\n\nHave you read about Socionics' Intertype relations? \nIf yes, tell me what you think.
2	It sounds like therapy would be a great starting point, as there is a lot that needs to be worked through here. I'd also recommend the book ["Attached" by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller](https://www.amazon.com/Attached-Science-Adult-Attachment-YouFind/dp/1585429139/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1537919319&sr=8-1&keywords=attached), as well as ["Deeper Dating" by Ken Page](https://www.amazon.com/Deeper-Dating-Seduction-Discover-Intimacy-ebook/dp/B00PSKOZ6W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1537919365&sr=8-1&keywords=deeper+dating). Always chasing after unavailable partners is a pretty common problem and I'm sure it's something you can overcome, if you are dedicated and willing to work on your own personal growth and healing. 
23	Just found this place and seemed like a safe place to vent.	Took the test awhile back and found I was ENFJ. Liked it but didn't put too much weight it in. Stumbled upon this place by hitting random and upon reading some entries thought it would be a good place to speak.\n\nI feel that I just am too much for people. I get excited when I find we have stuff in common and don't half-ass relationships. \n\nMy Last relationship fell apart partly because I was...to intense I guess. Like I just loved to be around her, always had a hug, kiss, or hand hold for her. There was no valleys with me. She said once "I never have a chance to give you a hug because you always give me one first."\n\nDon't know what else to say, probably a bit rambling and good chance this will get deleted later. Just needed to say this.
11	100% relate to this. I have a 0 or 100 attitude towards everything: work, relationships, friendships. It's frustrating when it's not reciprocated or, at the very least, appreciated. 
8	This happens to me all the time. I feel ya
7	As an ENFJ on the receiving end of this kind of behaviour, I can tell you it is the fastest way to kill a relationship. And considering I am also very much a 0 to 100 kind of person that's saying something.\n\nYou need to hold back slightly and let her feelings manifest whilst giving her the space to express them at her own pace. If you don't do this, you might lose the relationship entirely. Depending on how extreme the keen behaviour is, it could be considered love bombing or fast forwarding.\n\nIt's worth reading up on both of those, your affection sounds completely genuine but in the intensity and speed of it, it can be a huge red flag. Like I said, I've experienced it recently and have expressed the need to slow down. He hasn't listened and it's killed things. Perhaps the affection itself isn't the issue, but the lack of awareness of how that makes the other person feel. \n\nI don't know the exact ins and outs so I can't say what you're like, that's just my experience. \n\nEdit: spelling. \n\n
6	Don't ever apologize for being "too much" you are the person that was designed and created in your own perfect way. Keep pushing into the uncomfortable, and living life as you would like. That childlike enthusiasm is beautiful to be around. At least my ENFJ butt thinks so! 
3	Oh yeah.  That's totally me.  You just need to find someone who enjoys the passion and intensity.  I found myself a lovely INTP and he embraces (and returns) the childlike enthusiasm of our relationship. 
2	Find an ISTJ. They'll appreciate you for who you are. \nRead about Socionics' Intertype relations.
2	You’re great just the way you are, even if not everyone can appreciate it.
1	Hey man, I struggled with this as well! I feel like I have si much love to give! I hadbto work on how I act in a relationship, you have to be mindful of your over enthusiastic tendencies, and try to see things through the eyes of your partner as well. Also, find someone that doesn't mind the occasional "too much" that you are. Until very recently I thought I would never find someone like that, but it's out there man.\n\nAll the best
13	Dating life in a loop	So all before the age of 25, I’ve had a kid, I’ve been married and divorced, and a whole lot of other things in-between there. All of the life experience I’ve accumulated has throttled me into this place of “I’m light years ahead” of anyone my age. So I’ve been trying to date anyone 6 to 10 years older than me anddddd I get the same exact story every single time. I’m “intimidating because I’m so independent and have it so together” or “I’m so self aware that it makes them unsure of themselves” all while telling me how wonderful I was to them and never once have I made them feel bad, they just realize they’re not ready for someone like me.... y’all, I don’t even know what to do at this point. As an ENFJ, I’m super aware of what my partners need and none of my ex’s have said a bad thing about me. I’m super supportive and am adaptable to what my partner need. Im content with being by myself and doing my own thing if I have a partner that needs space more than me. Most of the guys try to even date me again, but I’m just so over getting burned by these statements that once someone ends things with me I just don’t bat an eye there way. It’s super disappointing. Has anyone been in this kind of loop? Is dating really this hard? 
6	I feel you... it's so hard to find that in between, where you have all your shit together but aren't intimidating to people. Sometimes partners are just as attracted to flaws as they are to positive qualities... I guess all I can really say is cheesy, but also true: eventually the right person will come along and appreciate you for the wonderful person I'm sure you are. 
3	Yes!! I've always been in a similar loop! Unfortunately, all my exes, both male and female, have told me at some point that my "always having it together" makes them feel insecure about themselves (and lose faith in our relationship.) I understand how frustrating and disappointing it is to be stuck in this kind of loop and it awfully drives you to just give up on the whole dating thing.\n\nBut I believe all that has happened to us so far is wrong people and bad timings. Don't give up and keep doing you!! The right person who really loves you for who you are wholeheartedly will come along and always fight for you <3
3	Wow you're only 1 year older than me and you have all that life experience! Amazing! :D\n\nI just want to say that as an I/ENTP who doesn't have his shit together, that I really admire people like you and don't find you intimidating at all - I actually find those qualities very attractive. \n\nIs it that you aren't attracted to people who don't have their lives together, or is it just their insecurity that's the problem? \n\nEdit: Just realised it's them breaking up with you that's the problem. My question still stands - for my own curiousity - but I'd say that NP types would be more open to dating a woman who doesn't necessarily need them, with the bonus (if you see it that way) of being very loyal and appreciative of any support you can provide them.
3	Lollllll yup... I used to date guys who I think I could "save" or help turn their life for the better (go back to school, go after their dream job, etc.) but then it turned into I was intimidating bc of my good job/happy-go-lucky attitude towards goals and dreams. it was rough, and i was stuck in that loop for a while. I am insanely happy now (an ISFJ) who is this same way though, he wants the best for me and himself and gets really motivated by my drive to help him and myself reach our dreams. the people right for you are out there, I promise. 
2	Yup. \n\nMarried. Well, separated. Because I've put so much into the relationship and am so "independent" and "with it" that he never felt he needed to participate or try. I finally point out that he never tried and he's like "I didn't know I needed to." \n\nMy unsolicited advice: wait for the one who matches you. Who gives you what you give him/her. I imagine it will be extremely worth it. 
1	Hi! I can also relate to this- I've found this to be an issue with friends periodically as well. It's hard, because I think as an ENFJ, our (or at least my) inclination is to shield people from my weak moments. I usually bounce back quickly, and I don't like to burden my friends and partners with what I deem as my insignificant issues and insecurities. But then you do yourself a disservice, because your friends and partners assume that you are superhuman- and don't have the normal doubts and moments of self-criticism that we all do, and they become ashamed to share their insecurities with you. I have worked very hard, personally, at being more open and vulnerable. It is terrifying, but so worth it. I can tell that you have it together (I feel like I do most of the time too), but you wouldn't be writing this post if you didn't have things you feel self-conscious about. No one is as together as people seem to think they are- even when I'm overwhelmed and stressed people are telling me I have it so together- and sometimes, it's like "can't you tell I'm drowning on the inside??" They seriously can't. Tell them. Take a deep breath and share with someone you trust and want to get closer to- it can really grow and deepen a relationship and the person you're with will see that you are a human work in progress just like them. Totally worth the scary jump into the abyss. Be as raw as you dare, and then maybe even a little more. I found talks by Brene Brown and similar resources (even just googling vulnerability in relationships --- or my own personal most recent search "vulnerability vs neediness") to be particularly helpful. 
28	I'm an ENFJ. Sometimes I feel sad for a long period of time. Does that ever happen to you guys?	
29	Yeah but I think it’s just my depression 
17	Yes, what usually bothers me is the fact that I have no one to share my life with.. do you have someone?
11	We do really well moodwise with consistent workouts. I know I do! \n\nHave you tried working out consistently for two months?\n\nIt destroyed my depression.\n\nAlso, be sure to get sunlight. Low vitamin D is linked to depressed moods.\n\nYou’ll be alright friend. 
18	Why do you guys feel this way, you guys are such amazing people and i want to tell you the weight of the world is not your's to bear alone. You can't fix this world all alone. It isn't your sole responsibility. \nYou can't make everyone happy. \nYou just do you yo, take care of yourselves and your needs and all that and pls for fucks sake stop being so stubborn and fussy at times. 
6	I feel that way sometimes...a lot actually. What helps me is going to locations where a lot of people are around! I don't necessarily talk to them but having productive people around generally makes for a better mood when I'm feeling this way.  For example, going to a coffeeshop with a nice book/laptop or going to the gym.
4	I think this happens to everyone and I can definitely relate. Seek therapy and find someone who understands you. 
2	How Do You Handle Romance?	As the title says, how do you ENFJs handle romantic relationships, general feelings, unrequited feelings, or crushes? What are your experiences when it comes to figuring out how you feel about a person? Have you tried to prevent catching feelings for certain individuals?\n\nHave you had your heart broken or never confessed your feelings to someone you fell hard for? \n\nAs an ENFJ myself, I'm interested to hear your responses because we tend to see the best in others which lead to a natural sense of compatibility with most people. I'm flirtatious and love getting to know a girl I have my eyes on but when it comes down to feelings and taking the next steps to define things, I've struggled with a lot and it usually eats at me due to a fear of rejection and inadequacy. Have any of you felt this way? 
15	As an ENFJ who didn’t have a healthy relationship modeled for me, my romantic life has been overwhelmingly codependent since I was 15 (I’m 32). Since then, I have consistently been in long-term relationships. My fear of rejection manifested in seeing each relationship through the long way (“convincing” them to stay with me) despite troubles early on that could’ve cut things short. I haven’t been willing to let people go. You mentioned compatibility with many types... I find this to be quite true. I don’t know if this answers your question at all, but yes I 100% see the best in others (including still how I view almost of my exes), but this view in the past has come at a detriment to myself. For the first time in my life, I’m trying to be in a relationship with myself. Hope this response is useful somehow.
10	So I am my best when I am in a relationship. I want to be the best version of myself knowing I have my bestfriend cheering me on. Don’t get me wrong I can do it alone but since I’m an extrovert I love the praise. They have to be my bestfriend  and be the best versions of themselves around me. There is no length of how much love can be given or received. I like raw and silly people. I want to know there secrets and what makes them happy. I want a future with my boyfriend and I want it now type thing. I’m very goal oriented and I need to know my partner is on the same wave length as me. I certainly pick up on cues if they are acting a different way with another person in the room and I don’t like that so I’m very aware of what I like and what I don’t. Little gestures are my weakness. And i show that I appreciate them, smothering them in affection is a weakness also. I love cuddles and kisses and goodmorning and goodnight texts. I love when my boyfriend opens the car door for me, it’s a habit of his and every time I see him I call in love with him over and over again. I’ve read that ENFPs are lovers. There is no depth to label us, we love to be loved and love no matter how weird the other person is also. Xo
6	Insecurity is something you'll have to work on. Personally, I know 100% that I will find someone to fall in love with because I am great with people. People fall in love with me all the time, I'm not inadequate in the slightest in their eyes or mine. If they don't want to date me, then that's a bummer but I move on very quickly and just chalk it up to just one of those unfortunate life things.\n\nIt is extremely easy for me to catch feelings for people (and for them to catch feelings for me). So I mostly date online, and I try to screen out as many incompatibilities as I can (OK Cupid is pretty good for this). I get a lot of matches (due to genetic benevolence), so thinning the herd is pretty crucial. I also have a solid rule to never ignore a deal breaker, and I have made myself walk away from very awesome guys because of that - and always found someone else I liked even more. Respect and enforce your own boundaries, because I have had so much trouble with this. \n\nSo I am great at the beginning part of dating and I can charm the pants off anyone... But once I catch real feelings for someone, I can become a little shy or guarded initially. It makes me nervous to trust myself, because of the 2 failed relationships behind me. I get easily swept off my feet so I'm just trying to make sure before I take the plunge. Once I do that, it's on. I become beyond romantic, very cuddly, love giving gifts, spending time together, write romantic letters, etc. \n\nBut as for walking away from people you have a crush on but would make a bad match - that's just part of life. It's self discipline. You gotta walk away from all kinds of stuff - junk food, saying a mean but satisfying comment, etc. This is one of those things, makes no sense to dwell on it or feed it. Just keep meeting new people and the attraction will fade.
4	i can also relate to this.  Fear of rejection and being alone made me serial date a ton.  After thousands of meetings of various people: friends and realtionsihps, I learned that it's best to take things as they are and try to keep expectations to a minimum.  Things take time to develop even if it feels like everything is super perfect and that you know the person you are with to a T.  Time does really matter and you can't say you know someone well if it's been only a short time. \n\nI personally use to look into all the options and possibilities that could take place from current level of relationship with someone.  I'd ask around and try to speculate what they were thinking and would be a bit codependant on them for my happiness.  Now, I see any sort of relationship being something that starts out as a small plant seed that will take time and work to grow.  I do understand the feeling of wanting to have an instant max level ship with someone, but that's just not realistic.  Taking things slow is evaluating your needs and the person's needs and going at a pace where both of you are comfortable with.  If you are curious about anything, you communicate it and get a feel of the situation.
36	I'm too much of a yes-Man	I have a lot of difficulty in saying no to people. I always feel like I'll be disappointing them if I do, and it often leaves me feeling burned out and overwhelmed due to the amount of things I have going at any given time. Can any other ENFJs relate, and if so, what have you done to help yourself be able to tell others "no"?
7	So you are actually hitting on what Gretchen Rubin calls your "tendency" or how you react to external and internal expectations. There are four categories hypothesized by Rubin. These are upholder (fulfils both internal and external), rebel (rejects both internal and external), questioner (rejects external but fulfils internal) and obliger (rejects internal but fulfils external). Her observations of each group led her to their titles. To me it sounds like you are an obliger.\n\nI am personally an obliger as well. If someone asks me to do something then I think it would be a nice to do it for them and I feel a drive to do it. However without that external drive I may never do it. For instance if my wife is home and asks me to clean up something I will do it without question. Hence the house is clean. However I TEND not to clean as much when she takes trips even though I love having a clean house and workspace. I reject internal expectations! I can very strongly relate to your struggle as I constantly feel pressure to go out when a friend asks even if I have more pressing things to do. What ended up happening was I would say yes to everything or never flat out reject and I would have to say no at the last moment. It felt awful.\n\nHere are some strategies I've employed since learning about the four tendencies which have greatly helped me:\n\nBe obliged to those people in the future so that you are giving them clear information -- People get more let down when plans change so remember that ultimately you will be letting them down later if you say yes now.\n\nFind a another person to be obliged to -- I'm now obliged to my wife and I try to remember that if I say yes to everything now then I might be letting her down later. This was tough at first since obligers sometimes absorb their significant others into their own being. However I have since corrected this and now this strategy works fairly well.\n\nFind another obliger or a accountability group to help you stay on track with your personal goals such as not going out a certain number of nights a week -- A strategy that works amazingly is to set your goal and then set a way to let down another person in some way if you don't meet that goal. I personally got myself to wake up early in the morning using this technique. If I didn't wake up on time at any time during the week then he didn't get to go to get his favorite pizza that week.\n\nYou can find more information about the tendencies through Rubin's book which I highly recommend. She also has a quiz people can take here:\n\nhttps://quiz.gretchenrubin.com/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=4Tlandingpage\n\n\nI'm interested to see how many obligers are in the enfj group. I hypothesize that it's a majority.\n\n\n\n
4	I found the easiest way is just to initially delay. So, don’t be put on the spot. It’s hard to say no at that moment when they ask. So, just say something like “ok thanks for asking, I need to just check blah blah blah (my schedule, check with my partner, or anything just to delay) and then I’ll let you know if I can do it” \n\nAnd then most of the time it gives me a little time to just think about if I want to do that thing for them. And most of the time I’ll do it. But it gives enough of a space for me to know if I’m doing it because I want to do it. Or to come up with a better excuse why I can’t do it if I don’t want to. \n\nSounds simple, but it made a big difference to me. Don’t be pushed into saying yes there and then, tell them you’ll think about it and then respond after a pause for thought. (5 mins, 30 mins, tell them you’ll think about it over lunch or even sleep on it). 
3	I've accepted that I just don't like doing certain stuff, or engaging in certain conversation. With this on mind my reasoning is always:\n\nIf they have a problem with me not liking that stuff or reacting in a certain way, then they're just not my tipe of people. You can't please everyone. Keep your own interests at the top of your priority list. Also, accept that not everyone in this world is going to like you, and that's perfectly fine.
3	I usually delay and talk the decision over with someone who knows me well. Sometimes I’ll even write down what they say on my phone as a reminder to not overextend and to take care of myself first! A lot of people close to me can generally tell whether I really want to do the thing or just feel compelled to. 
11	How are you developing your leadership skills?	
8	I direct plays. Every cast is a new leadership opportunity. I get to make a lot of mistakes, and then start over without having to live in the consequences (mostly), but with the benefit of what I’ve learned. Practice practice practice!
5	Looking for jobs in a management role. Until then, I’m working on coaching people. Great question. Something for me to think about. 
3	My preferred method for anything is learning the basics from someone/a course/a book and then go deepen that knowledge/skill via experimentation (and hence experience).\n\nI was put in a management role 7 years ago and so I have that experience, but Leadership is so much more than management. I’ve taken a bunch of leadership courses that have given me tips as to how to develop. I’m looking into doing an MBA with a focus on leadership within the next 5 years.\n\nThe best leadership course I’ve taken thus far taught me that Leadership = leading (coaching, mentoring, teaching) people “under” you, managing those “above” you, and influencing your peers. I took this course about 2 years ago when I was already doing that some, but I’ve been really emphasizing that this past year and I can clearly see the difference. Lots of positive feedback from my boss and peers and things are genuinely going better (more smooth) now. \n\nI guess TLDR is “via experience”. If you’re not in a leadership/management position at your job, find a position in your hobby or a volunteering position. (The latter has the added benefit of looking great on your resume 👍)\nI lead my recreational soccer team. It’s a good place to practice leadership skills I want to try out at my job. \n
2	Every job I’ve ever had, I’ve been offered a position of management. It’s like they see something in me that I don’t. I don’t feel like I’m bossing these people around, and neither do they. It all just happens naturally, and our work is exemplary and thorough. After over two decades of such experiences, it’s just engrained in me. I just keep taking on more, it’s just my nature. For the longest time it’s been fulfilling, but finally it’s been more financially rewarding of late. Here’s hoping that trend continues...🤞
2	Being a good leader is about being a good role model. You need to walk the walk. I'm focusing on living in the way that I would want to lead people in.\n\nAlso am a teacher, so there's that.
1	By....leading? idk really. Remember that the people you’re leading are all working with you toward a mutual goal, you’re just directing everyone’s journey to get there.
1	Learn what leadership is or what a good leader does.\n\nIn some of my classes, they said it varies between culture but I'd take that with a grain of salt, though. \n\nAlso, most ENFJs are natural leaders so I wouldn't worry too much. If you have to worry about it, don't forget to delegate and not do it all yourself. 
17	Where are the ENFJ males at?	I am an INFP female (23) who constantly attracts INTP males, gets into relationships with them, and it turns out very poorly each time. I feel generally unhappy, I tend to have little in common with the guys, I can never have a meaningful conversation with them, they’re not very romantic (they’re very lazy about it actually), the INTP’s I’ve dated/been in a relationship with tend to behave like assholes. They’ll be nice and attractive at first, but as time goes on they become less and less the man I was initially attracted to.. I’m also too emotional for them when I am really upset, they can’t deal with this at all from my experience. \n\nSo I look up online what is the best match for my personality type and the results say ENFJ. I do a little reading and I really like what I see. Especially all the articles repeating that ENFJ men are compassionate and caring, they care deeply for their loved ones, they care about their appearance, they are charismatic and well-liked by others, they have strong values, they enjoy good conversation, and they’re very romantic men (I realize that these qualities may not be true for all men of this personality type and it really boils down to the individual). \nThese are all very attractive traits to me, especially the deeply caring, very romantic, and enjoying conversation parts. \n\nI have no idea where to find this type of man and how to attract this type to me (once I find where y’all hang out). I am a reserved young woman who spends most of her time at home besides attending college and running errands. \nAs far as attracting goes on a physical aspect, I am in shape, dress very feminine, I have long hair, I wear light makeup, I just try to look feminine and beautiful wherever I go. \n\nWhat careers/jobs do ENFJ males usually get themselves into? What kind of places do you guys like to go to hang out or enjoy yourselves? Have you ever dated an INFP woman? Are you still together? 
10	haha NFs I hear are one of the most rare types that take up maybe 2% of population for each NF category. Although it's nice to think about how personality types match up with each other, there's no accurate match up.  ENFJs and INFPs are generally good together, but I've heard of INFPs matching well with say ENTJ or some other type.  I'd recommend just going out and meeting new people in general as trying to find a certain type is somewhat difficult.  My ENFJ buddy use to date an INFP girl, but they suffered issues with communication and conflict resolution. I'm an ENFJ girl dating an INFP guy and our relationship is still going strong. I met him at a club (he's not one to go clubbing often if at all and totally doesn't go anymore)
7	I'm the entertaining personality in the room. People will think I'm a player because I can be super playful, flirty, charismatic, and maybe even charming to some... but what I really am is a a social butterfly, a big dork, and a super sensitive person. I'm like an onion. LAYERS. I really don't know if anyone truly understands me because of how complex I am. I would say I am intelligent AND possess emotional intelligence. I'm also a hopeless romantic and a perfectionist.\n\nI love helping people... whether it be just in school, minor favors, or helping them get through issues. I enjoy deep conversations but rarely get many of these. I want to be completely vulnerable with a woman but another side of me is afraid of being hurt. As such, I've been single for like ever and everyone who finds out I'm single is always surprised... Idk if I'm intimidating or too dorky or too much of a perfectionist that it turns people off...\n\nI was a swimmer for 14 years so I have a good physique. I take care of myself by working out, committing to good hygiene (skincare, shower twice a day, shave, cologne), and watching what I consume. I have days where I can go out and be super social, but I have other days where I'm drained and just want to stay home and do nothing.\n\nFor my career, I'm interested in finance and investments. I'm going to be interning at a commercial real estate firm in a few weeks! I am seriously considering being a college professor once I get experience and start a family since I'd like to have more time for my future kiddos.\n\nQuestion for you is... how do I find an INFP?
6	ENFJ men are actually very rare, so you might be better off just looking for NF men in general. However, in general ENFJs are often found in the teaching profession, volunteering for charities, involved in local politics, participating in social justice activism, leading spiritual/religious groups, and doing psychology/personal development courses.
7	For careers, I'm an ENFJ guy, I'm planning to get into product management and eventually founding a startup. I've also considered medicine, but not so sure anymore (my family is full of doctors and it's less rosy picture than it's painted from an outside perspective). 
4	I’m an ENFJ man. For me, I find that it is most important to find compatibility from more than just the Meyers Briggs personality type. Also look at your love language too. This was key in finding my wife as we also have complementary love languages (how we best express love and prefer to receive love). \n\nGood luck!
5	I’m an ENFJ male (27). I’m in a similar boat as you. I agree with one of the other comments. I’m down for INFJ, INFP, or ENFJ women. I can’t do sensor types romantically, they live on a different planet than me and make me feel weird about myself. \n\nI also prefer a more traditionally valued woman, definitely someone who is more submissive and in tune with their womanhood. I think I would personally be best paired with a fellow ENFJ, but regardless I’m not sure where you would find us. If there were some sort of secret NF hideaway I would definitely frequent there. However, we live in a vast world where we are subjected to working 50 hours a week. Outside of work, I do not go out and socialize as much as you’d think an ENFJ would. If I were you, I’d look for the clues. ENFJs are all about extroverted feeling (our primary function), we’ll be the ones socializing with everyone and making sure they are having a good time in public. We are not shy, we are goofy and warm. I personally don’t engage in much small talk, so that would be another indicator for you to look for. Best of luck to you, mystery woman! 
3	As an ENFJ guy, I've tried to get as much experience in a wide variety of professions as possible, and am usually working 2-3 jobs at any given time. I've worked as a laborer for a construction company, housekeeper, waiter, secretary, direct marketer, personal tutor, and security officer. I've finally decided to pursue a future in education.\n \nThe thing that I've come to realize about myself though is that, while I feel that I am compassionate and empathetic, I also tend to be especially hard on myself due to feeling as though I haven't done enough to warrant praise a lot of the time. This isn't something that will affect all ENFJs, but it isn't completely uncommon either.\n \nI was dating an INFP woman while in college. It was the best relationship I've ever been in, and we only split up when I had decided to move across the country to be near my family to help them out. She stayed back to be near her family, and we both agreed that we didn't want to attempt a long distance relationship. She and I still talk regularly and we usually meet up once or twice a year in person whenever we can both get time off work and afford plane tickets.
4	I’m a 20 year old ENFJ guy! Like others have said, ENFJs make up a small percentage of the population and even lesser if male. Career wise, I am pursuing business administration with a concentration in marketing. I did medicine for 2.5 years because I liked the idea of helping people but business came to me more naturally and helped optimize the social side of me. I’ve noticed that when I’m in a field I have a talent for, I’m very ambitious in it. I’ve been going to Wall Street for interviews with big companies, expanding my skill set through online marketing certifications, and actively seeking internships and mentors. I need to feel like I’m on the right path and feeling successful is important to me.\n\nI enjoy being around my friends and having quality conversation. I don’t really like going to dancing bars and stuff bc I’m a cringy dancer and I just can’t talk to anyone bc the music is too loud haha. I enjoy my wine nights with friends, exploring the city for hidden gems, and just being surrounded by passionate people. I love talking to people and understand their struggles and emotions. Nothing is more fulfilling than feeling like I had some hand in helping someone. If I can make them smile or laugh, it makes me overjoyed and I’m usually that jokester/conversationalist type with my friends. I am pretty flirty as well. I’ll compliment people often but only if I mean it and this can lead to those flirty conversations. \n\nMy best friend is an INFP. I love this personality type because they are so accepting and it’s easy to trust them. I confide in them and love the open and goofy conversations we have. I’ve seen they come from a place of genuine place with their words and always look for the best in others. Truly the most gentle and compassionate souls
3	I’m an ENFJ male (23). Never met another ENFJ male ever in my life lol 
2	Don’t box yourself in by trying to date a specific type. It sounds like you just need some sort of feeler type, and you can use that as a springboard for finding people you’re compatible with. 
1	I'm an ENFJ, have a degree in exercise physiology - love writing music, teaching guitar, making arty bits and I race bikes competitively 
1	I'm a male enfj with a degree in physics and a doctorate in materials science and engineering. I've never met another guy or girl like me! Maybe I wasn't paying close enough attention...I also have ADHD.\n\nI honestly don't think this model is going to perfectly predict relationship success. I'm with an istj female and we get along amazing even though we're opposites in a lot of ways! We've been together for 5 years now. \n\nThat being said I really don't know what makes a relationship succeed or fail. No need to just look for 2% of the population though. From what I've seen, no one really knows what they're looking for until they find it.

1	Yo right here. I actually have ended up dating mostly ES and EN girls. I think its just a thing in normal human lifestyles that pushes us to end up more often than not with fellow extroverts/introverts.
1	Just learned I was ENFJ because my ex had me take it, she was an INFP.\nMakes sense.\nI liked how she could be home bound, caring, compassionate but didn't like being around other people like my fam or friends and never wanted to go out. I found that extremely depressing, which is what ended our relationship. We were together for three years. It was hard to break up but it was killing friendships and alienating family. Recovering my social life now and reconnecting with friends. \n\nI work in sales as a stock broker.\nI do like more conservative women, who dress fem, she's sub, gives physical affection, can be silly and ignores politics.\nI like real women, not these feminists men bashers, that want open relationships, piercings, tattoos, colored hair and only care about politics. \n\nI find myself at bars dancing like no ones watching, going to outdoor events. \nUsually the guy that's doing his own thing and not caring what others think and organizing events will be enfj. But we're a 3% chance. Keep your eyes out lol\n
12	The Piece	\nI see life as something a bit like a game of tetris\n\nEverything is a hit and miss\n\nYou try to find out the piece that fits\n\n\nEvery block is what I search for\n\nThe block that would make me whole\n\nThe one that would make me complete\n\n\nHowever every time I think I found that piece\n\nIt turns out not to be the right one\n\nThus disappearing along with all the other pieces\n\nI hope and hope that the blocks wouldn't disappear\n\nMy hardships continuing to tumble upon me\n\nUnable to find that piece that fits\n\n\nWhen it seems I am so close to completion\n\nNone of the pieces are what I am looking for\n\nAnd in the end, it's GAME OVER for me.\n
4	Excellent poem, thank you for sharing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReminds me of [this meme](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c2/ed/44/c2ed442469e9974ac5a50dc23b3934d4.jpg), where the ENFJ is the "Original Character" who is "fictional. Keeps trying to sacrifice self for the greater good. Doesn't know what that is."
2	r/NF_writing might like these :)
1	Awesome poem :) thank you for sharing 
3	Enneagram Music Subreddit	Here’s a subreddit to associate music with Enneagram:\n\n[/r/EnneagramMusic](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnneagramMusic/)
12	Falling inlove	As an ENFJ I have a lot of love to give. Me and this girl have been hitting it of very well, we talk for hours and we share so much interests, yet do are different in many ways. She feels like the best friend I never had! I am very interested in datinf her of course, and I am told ny her friend she has roughly the same idea as me, but the thing is I have to constantly have reality checks and keep myself from being "too much". I can't seem to think of anything else, I can't get work done, I can dream of anything else, I must be very inlove. But, this is early days. \n\nSo my question to you guys is what do I do to just het through a day without having an explosion of butterflies in my stomach, and should I fight this feeling or should I just let myself feel? Kinda feel lost, I am so afraid of messing this up!
10	Fighting your feelings is never a good idea.  Bottling it up can be pretty unhealthy. Especially for feeler types, it's best to just let the feelings flow and be honest about it.  As night says, just go ahead and ask her out.  Making mistakes is a part of life and it's really impossible to not make any.  Plus you're also probably thinking you don't want to risk your friendship with this girl by confessing your feelings.  However, if you just maintain friendship and try to hide your feelings, you'll always be left with the "what if" thoughts and these feelings can turn into resentment if you don't play your cards right.  \n\nIt's highly recommended you just go for it and learn from what happens after.  You can express your interest (just say you are interested in getting to know her better and would like to date).  Then from there you guys can see each other and gauge the compatibility.  If things don't work out with this girl, you'll know better when it happens again next time.\n\nHonestly though, one can't say they truly love someone without first overcoming adversity.  This is extreme feelings of infatuation (aka crush). I personally like to see love in its stages: infatuation -> falling in love -> love.  Infatuation being the preliminary stages of attraction, falling in love is the duration of the dating period, then being in love after overcoming arguments and resolving conflicts with said partner.
5	Fellow male enfj here. Just ask her out and see what happens! My wife is istj-t and I would say we're almost opposites when it comes to a lot of things. But we get along amazing and she's my very best friend. Enfj is only around 2% of the population so the chances of you finding someone just like you (or else someone who mostly fits into some of your same categories) is pretty slim.\n\nThat being said - don't worry about messing this up. Relationships are super difficult and even being good friends with someone doesn't ensure success. Emotional communication and goal alignments are required. The fact is you won't know till you try and the more time you spend wondering the less time you'll get to spend on actually finding the right fit.
2	Be yourself! It's rare to find someone like what you're describing. I had someone like that and it was great. 
1	Same situation here. Met an isfj
15	The end of a night	Does anyone ever find themselves finishing a night out with friends (maybe just drinks, or perhaps a catchup in a bar) and end up feeling more alone afterwards? It's like post-event come down. It might come from the perfectionist part of us, where we want to do something (talk to a guy or girl) and maybe we didn't take the chance and kind of ruminate it for a while. Sometimes I find myself feeling a bit "meh" after a night out for no other reason! Interested to hear any replies because I find it hard to put into words\n\n&#x200B;
7	Oh yes, me and my best buddy (also an ENFJ) would have a great weekend hanging out with friends, then afterwards it feels super empty. Honestly though it's not due to any regret for not talking to someone, it's more like we had so much fun and now have to return to reality xD.  It's ok though, it makes me appreciate the time I spend with my friends.
3	I feel for me, it has more to do with anxiety than ENFJ. I just spend the night after re-thinking interactions etc. Melatonin helps avoid this trap for me. Also generally (unfortunately), loud bars don't offer the proper domain for the kind of engagement I appreciate and am fulfilled by. 
2	I feel this too, but I think its because a lot of people go home with a loved one that'll always be there and I don't. Its like we want to share with someone how much fun we had?
19	/ grow up /	Sometimes I just want it to stop. \n\nThe instantaneous. \n\nWhere does the line begin?\n\nWhere does it end?\n\nDon’t be fooled by this melancholy\n\nFor I am grateful,\n\nA white woman living among the tribe,\n\nNecessities at my beck and call. \n\nBut it’s painful - I don’t know anything else. \n\nUncertainty is my suffering.\n\nUnknown kills me. \n\nBecause sometimes I’m not ready for the lesson,\n\nBut life keeps on moving. \n\nHow do we grow so patient in this digital age?\n\nWhen distraction is our calling. \n\nWhen having the answer is our discourse. \n\nDoes wisdom grow on trees?\n\nTake this time. \n\nUse it for you, they say\n\nBut I care so much about you. \n\nWhen you leave me, I suffer. \n\nWhen I leave you, I suffer. 
3	This poem is beautiful and very deep
1	Beautiful.  Do you write often?
1	Bravo!
9	I'm so confused	I (INFP) am in love with an ENFJ. She is the sweetest woman I've met and we talk almost daily. Not like when we first met 10 months ago though. \n\nShe didn't want a relationship because of the distance between us. Also she just got out of a long relationship. She stopped all sexual contact months ago because she had a bad experience in the past with sharing nudes.\n\nI cannot control my heart in this friendship. I get too attached. I become needy. I try to connect with her so I share something personal or play her a song, or draw her a picture but it just comes across as disingenuous.  Like I'm trying to impress her.\n\nI don't want to ghost her but I don't know what else to do. I'm so confused.  This is the closest relationship I've had in 15 years. I have never felt this vulnerable with someone in my life.  I feel lost. \n
7	The issue that I have with INFPs, is that they share something with you as a way to connect, but don't always follow through with the conversation and depth necessary to build a real connection. It feels disingenuous to me sometimes because their feelings differ so greatly from mine, which makes me confused and suspicious. I find it common with infps to idealise me too quickly (before learning who I am). So it's like a fantasy version of me, wearing my skin, running around their head. I can tell because they interact with me as if I'm their fantasy. I can be disconnected in a conversation and they dont seem to notice. I want to be seen... You need to be patient to gather all that information.\n\nI find it irrarional to withdraw from friends, because I only open up to them when they've been "chosen". Unless I've decided that too many interactions are stressful or boring, and then I will get more distant until I can door slam you easily. The fact that she's pulled back makes me wonder if she ever saw you in the same way you did... \n\nIt makes me scared seeing how intense and blinded infps views of me can be... especially when i feel like they dont really KNOW me in more than just one area of my life... I am but a muse to their internal daydreams. In actuality, I am multi-faceted. \n\nThe advice I use is: a relationship is balanced when each person equally shares initiating contact. You may not want to ghost her, but I don't think of it like that. Actions speak louder than words. Its science. Observe how long it takes them to message you. Because that will give you an indicator of how much effort the person wants to put in, and how much they prioritise the friendship. Sometimes, due to factors, it will be uneven, but there should still be balance and understanding.\n\nP.S - Apologise for your percieved eagerness, and then tell her about the 15 years thing. That's the stuff we love.
4	Honesty is the key to survival. If I had any constellation, myers, or human be honest and upfront I would respect that person much more. Dont shy or hide away from what is happening in your heart. Be honest and transparent with how you feel and what is going on in your guts. When she responds don't get in your emotions! Knowing myself (ENFJ) the response probably wont be what you are looking for. Remember, no expectations, just exsist, and be your INFP self. 
4	Oh my gosh I’m going through the same thing. Why do you guys disappear how do we get you ENFJ s attention t just reply
12	Proneness to Depression and Advice on How to Deal with It?	Is there a proven correlation between our type and developing depression? \n\n\nFor those who struggle with it, any advice or tips on how to cope with it? I've been in the troughs of it for quite a few years now. But given some changes recently, I've been doing pretty terribly and feel increasingly restless and like I'm legit going insane. I'm at my wits end.
6	ENFJs are certainly prone to depression. I’ve covered it extensively in my previous posts here and it’s a topic I’m more than happy to discuss. It’s a problem you can generally read about further in Carl Jung’s [Psychological Types](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Jung/types.htm) in chapter 9, Introverted Intuitive Types. Overall, ENFJs are concerned with questions of meaning for themselves their thoughts, actions, of others, and what this means for the world. They have a vision which they are trying to achieve for their life and others, and can find themselves outside of achieving it. They are often times confronted with moral dilemmas which they try to solve with their extroverted feeling Fe, and become overwhelmed because of their Ti or introverted thinking. \n\nThe question is whether you can pinpoint what the depression is the result of. Journal entries with a flow of consciousness approach is good, as long as you’re trying to be as truthful as possible in order to confront some harsh truths about how you feel. In looking back you may see a trend in the types of things that affect you, in how you relate to the world, personal issues, work, friends, family, aspirations. You can find identify things that stress you out, perhaps related to past trauma and see whether they create a bad cycle of habits that follow. Admitting there is a problem is the first step. Identifying the issue is the next.\n\nYou may consider seeing a doctor or therapist to help you find some solution to those issues. I’ve only done it a couple times but I haven’t gone back since and have made tremendous positive changes as a result of my visits. \n\nLast piece of advice, try to limit the amount of time on finding the key to unlock your mind, etc. healthy habits includes our thinking limiting our bad thoughts, of recognizing when our emotions are shifting.
3	Yeah. I'm in the middle of a bit of an episode myself. Digging myself out. Kinda.  \n\nMeds. Exercise. Proper food. SLEEP. \n\nDon't discount the meds part. Serotonin isn't something you control the production of, so don't beat yourself up for not making enough of it. 
5	INTJ here. Depression has many causes. It's not well known however that one of the most common causes has to do with diet / lifestyle. At least that was the cause in my case and the following tweaks in my diet / lifestyle turned out to be the overarching remedy for me:\n\n1. Wipe out sugar, coffee and the majority of carbohydrates from your diet. Smoking habits and alcohol will have to go too.\n2. Eat loads of fruits. At least 8 per day.\n3. Fix your diet (pay a visit to a dietologist and figure out if you are allergic to certain types of food). Be sure to make broccoli part of your weekly diet if your dietologist green-lights it.\n4. Drink lots of high-quality water\n5. Take up on magnesium supplementation (magnesium l-threonate also known as magtein is my suggestion here)\n6. Probiotics\n\nHope these help.
2	well the first thing would be to see a therapist that suits you.  It's pretty important to find a doctor that clicks with you, as all doctors are not cut from the same cloth.  My friends also say that if the depression is severe, it might take a few trial runs of medication to handle them.  Overall, I personally don't think depression is something you can get out of on your own.  You'll have to force yourself to eat and hang out with people, even though you don't want to (it actually helps a ton).
2	I recommend finding a consistent, out of work social experience that's not demanding where you can get some consistent social energy. Tabletop RPGs are what works for me. You never run out of topics to talk about (because you're playing a game while roleplaying a character) and they tend to run weekly or bi-weekly. 
1	I have tons of advice I could give you (source: horribly depressed for many years but now much better), but could you elaborate on it a bit more?\n\nIn other words, are there any specific things that you feel like are causing the depression? Do you feel better when doing certain activities? Or is it more so that you're just depressed without a particular reason (so it could be a chemical imbalance, etc.)?
4	Vacation location advice	My husband and I are on the mend after a really rough past 6 months. I want to elave the kiddo at home and take him somewhere, 2-3 days. We're in the mid-Atlantic, so nothing longer than a 3-4 hour flight. \n\nProblem: he's an INTP. He's so damn chill to the point where I think he's asleep or bored. I need movement. \n\nFind me the perfect place (please). 
2	How is he with hiking? Hiking would be a great way to reconnect with your man! You can either let him enjoy the silence or test the waters with a few different conversations you might want to have. \n\nHow about Rapid City, SD? \n\nI was lucky to go there last year and had a great time at Mount Rushmore, lots of information to take in at the museum. Idk your tolerance for patriotism but the nighttime talk was very beautiful to watch as a non-yank. Once you're done with the main event there's a TON of awesome walks in the surrounding national parks.\n\nI've never been, but I suppose you could make yourselves busy in D.C!

6	ENFJ Male having trouble in a relationship with an ISTJ Female	From the beginning of our relationship, Me (ENFJ) and her (ISTJ), I've seen how we compliment each other in our lives. It has made for a very incredible strong and rewarding relationship so far. It's only been 8 months, so not quite a year, but I still feel like we've been together a long time because I already feel "at home" with her.\n\nHowever I am also the type of person who loves to talk about things when they concern me, even if it seems miniscule. Seemingly absurd things, like "feeling left out of some situation" I really wanted to be a part of. Or "a conversation for planning a trip", and not getting to be in the ground zero planning process. I feel the need to express how I felt left out, and how I would never want to compromise her feelings, but I also want her to consider mine. She doesn't know she's doing it, and calls me out for being outrageous at worrying about this stuff. \n\nSo when I try to communicate with her about how I feel left out or bummed out by something, and that I just wanted to communicate my needs and feelings to her she just lashes back at me with **"im making a big deal out of nothing", "im trying to start a fight", "why can't you just exist and be chill", "why do you always have to make something out of nothing", etc...**\n\nI am then left on a huge guilt trip and feel like everything I thought was a positive effort turns out to be a negative result. I then start to obsess and worry that I am never understood and worry that this is a sign of things to come for us as a couple and maybe for me in all relationships, especially in regards to when it comes to discussing feelings or compromising each other's feelings. Everything I try to do was for an understanding but my efforts just slip away. It makes me feel like she just doesn't give a shit. She wants me to change and I want her to be more aware. But im the one left feeling like the fuck up. I'm not a normal human being, im a teenage high school over-obsessive girlfriend - according to her. \n\nIs this just a struggle with dating an ISTJ female as an ENFJ male? Or is this a struggle being an ENFJ male or ENFJ period when it comes to dating?
5	[deleted]
4	I will just add that often ISTJ's reactions are due to feeling threatened - they don't like dealing with what they don't understand, and feel a bit/lot anxious being put in a position where they don't know what's expected of them or how to handle the situation.  Anything that threatens them they have a bit of a tendency to pour contempt on, but really it's just a defence mechanism.  They seem to strongly pride themselves on being the competent go-to person who knows everything.  They are averse to experimentation, change, being exposed to the new and undefined, and they are averse to the world of feelings in many ways.  What's hard is that they don't wish to change.  I sadly lost my relationship with my ISTJ because the lack of will to change.  The contempt and resentment of my highly emotional nature became too much for me eventually to a point of being unbearable.\n\nAnyway, I got off point  My main point is that it can help to realise the underlying reason for a lot of ISTJ negative reactions is fear, anxiety and insecurity.  They don't like what they can't master or control.  THat may give you some useful information to help her handle your emotions, but if she's not willing to learn, you may have to revisit where you see the future of the relationship headed.  According to John Gottman, contempt is one of four strong predictors of relationship breakdown (google Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Gottman).
3	I can very much relate to your situation. I am also a male ENFJ and like you I feel the need to discuss the tiniest details of my emotional life.\n\nPersonnally I think it's great to be able to express ones feelings openly and in words, but it is also important to know when to shut up. I have been in situations with both me ESTJ ex and my current ENFP-girlfriend in which I start guilt-tripping over something I have done/said or someone else has not done/said or anything really. It seems to a large extent be a problem some of us have.\n\nWith that being said, it's not only up to you to change. You have to accept who you are and where it is important to not let those features be toxic it is also important to not push them away completely, cause they are a part of you. \n\nST types are generally a little less emotionally receptive than we are, and that was one of the reasons me and my ex broke up, but I don't think it has to be so for everyone. If you are able to communicate these things to her as clearly as you have to us here then I am sure you both can work it out and grow together into persons that complement each other even more.
2	Sorry this isn't more organized. And it kind of echoes other things posted here.\n\nShe shouldn't be making you feel guilty for expressing your feelings, and should probably put more effort into learning and understanding your needs. I mean, at minimum, since she's taken the MBTI and been typed, she should understand that there are different types of people out there who function in different ways, and that her opinions and her way of being are not correct for everyone.\n\nYou should probably take a hard look at yourself, who you are, and what you need. Learn to accept what you find, and work with it. And she should do the same. Figure out where compromise needs to happen in this relationship. Ask yourselves if you think you can in the ways that are needed. *But do not expect the other to change into a different person.* People can grow and learn to accept more and become more understanding, but it's unlikely one's basic fundamental self will change.\n\nFinally, I want to say that I think we tend to put too many expectations on our partners. One person is rarely going to fulfill all the roles in our lives, but for some reason we still expect them to. Friends, family, we all have different relationships with them, and we get different things from them. So what roles are you okay with your partner playing or not playing in your life? (What if it was unlikely that your ISTJ was ever going to understand you emotionally? Could you accept that? Would that be a deal breaker? Do the other roles that she plays provide enough in other areas for it to last? Is there someone else in your life who you feel does understand you? Can you talk to them about things? Would that be weird for you and your girlfriend? So...what roles are most important to you?)
1	talk about blind fe and it would really suck because your fe is dominant while her fe is blind ...as an isfj i feel youuu\n\nYou need someone to understand you completely :(\n\nI could tell she is not willing to compromise no offense. Every person neds to compromise when in a relationship to benefit one another. If she loves you for who you are, she will never say that no offense , just saying.\n\nIt's nobody's fault. You two just have different personalities and one should compromise and vice versa. It's all about working a relationship out and if one doesnt compromise , the only solution is to get out and find another person who will understand you completely. If you tried everything and she still doesnt compromise, then it's her fault not you\n\nBlind Fe can be a pain to us auxillary fe types especially to fe doms
1	Hey I'm actually also enfj male with an istj female. To me it sounds like she's having a lot of trouble stepping into your boots and is feeling threatened/frustrated that she can't understand. In my opinion how someone acts in a relationship is much more complicated than a simple personality model. Notably I do sometimes have trouble expressing myself if I feel I've been treated unfairly or if I want to be treated differently. Unlike your case this is because it shocks my wife and it causes her to beat herself up. Much like you, I would like to have \nan almost a business like discussion about my feelings: " this is how I feel when you do that, I would like to be treated like this". But unfortunately it's sometimes hard for her not to best herself up about it.\n\nHere is a general tactic that relationship councilors advise: use the formula "I feel ____ when you ____. I want _____.  Saying you feel that way instead of you don't like it when they do something is a good way to ensure someone that the blame isn't all on them. They are not bad for doing something, you are just making them aware of your feelings. This is not always perfect though as sometimes people still take things personally. Tell her that exactly what your doing first so she knows it's just a discussion about YOUR feelings.\n\n\nHow do you broach the subject of your feeling with your gf?\n\n
4	Do you find joking to be hard?	In short: what is joking? Opinions highly appreciated:) \nSo this probably is the dumbest question to ask, but as some of y'all may know over the last few mouths I have been slowly trying to understand the culture of joking haha many may know me as the Encyclopedia, but I know many probably dislike that from anybody all the time. I read something not too long ago that has lead me to really want to jump into the field of communication skills. Small talk leads to deep talks, which leads to friendships and overall relationships with people that can last a life time. I see it as vital to be fluently well diverse in all levels of communication. In many aspect I can be seen as introverted because I truly enjoy deep conversations, usually one on one or in really small groups. I am quite good at deep conversations and purely horrible in small conversations. They scare me and sometimes can give me anxiety. So lately until I master the field of jokes/small talk, I try to say little comments hoping perhaps they can lead into deep conversations. My analyzing has left me with one certainty...learn jokes asap haha...learn small talk, for only then can real talks slowly develop and take place and perhaps who knows, I may fall in love with small talk, for after all I do love jokes, and do love talking. Leaving to one question...what is joking? \nLike for me, I see joking as using anything in the moment in a humorous way...I believe this is correct, but what has always got me was, isn't this also flirting? Like what draws the difference? The intentions or tone of voice or the type of jokes? Perhaps I have already over thought this, to why perhaps jokes are hard for me to do. If truly jokes are just that, taking the moment and pulling out small things that could be joked about, joking is easy. Anyways, any thoughts on this??
7	I love humor and joke all the time! Furthermore, I love deep conversations and am also skilled at small talk. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJoking isn't also flirting, although it can be sometimes. Flirty jokes are usually sensual in nature. Joking in itself is just humor, which can fall into a wide variety of categories.
5	Joking is just a mix of wit and empathy. Having the temperature of the room and a little bit of empathy to get the feel for what a group would find funny then you're on your way. Oftentimes jokes are riding the boarder of what is appropriate in a situation, other times they can be sounding jokes (a thing sound like a thing, mix up the meaning, rhyme or intention of a words) or even more frequently good jokes are stories of experiences either straight up or altered to effect the group you're with.\n\nI do think you're likely chasing the wrong goal, however. Joking will come much more naturally if you can relax in a group. If you are more introverted this is going to be more difficult. If you are extroverted  and comfortable being with, reading and empathizing with people then jokes are just going to come naturally. Unless you're a trained comedian you don't really tell jokes, you laugh at life, yourself, situations and people laugh along with you. Good luck.
4	Nope. At school I was voted funniest in my year. I've always been quick witted and I love cheesy puns.
3	I am skilled in sarcasm...
2	Yes, I try to replicate types of jokes and joking styles and it falls flat or when I tell them it sounds like I'm just being insensitive. 
2	As some said, joking is a mix of wit and empathy. \n\nBut mostly, I found that it's just pointing out what's fun in a situation, like someone having a slip of the tongue, or a situation that is totally absurd out of context. \n\nTo get examples, I'd say :\n\nFor the former, someone says "I'd like to have you tonight" but what they meant was "we should stay later at work" but you emphasize the way they said it and they'll laugh. \n\nFor the latter, someone says "hand me a weiner" pointing at a hot-dog sausage for the replacement that he just dropped and you say "which one? ;) ;)".\n\nThere is also highly relatable content, but for this one just look at memes.\n\nSorry for the fact that these jokes are basic but English is not my first language and they were kinda hard to find on the spot. 
9	Dreading Monday mornings	When I was a kid, I hated Sunday nights. I always got this bad lonely/ anxiety type of feeling in my chest. I’d tell my parents and they’d tell me to ignore it and go to bed. Sometimes it made me cry.\n\nMonday morning rolls around, and once I get to school everything is fine. I remember that I have friends there etc and by lunchtime that feeling is completely gone. And stays home until Sunday night again. I was never able to get to the bottom of it and now I’m an adult and I don’t have it anymore (as far as I’m aware)\n\nI had forgotten about this since it’s been 3 decades since being in elementary school.\nI noticed my son has this now, and he’s in elementary school! His behavior brings back everything that I went through. It’s so similar it’s kinda scary. But I’m happy because I can comfort him by telling him “I get it”. Usually I just hug him until he feels better and then he falls asleep. He’s worried Monday morning until he gets to school, but after 1 hour at school it’s completely gone.\n\nI nor my son had any traumatic events between birth and elementary school (any more than average stuff. I’m very grateful for our luck)\n\nI want to ask you guys if this is something you feel as an ENFJ?\n\nFYI, i’m:\nModerate E\nStrong (Clear) N\nModerate F\nSlight J\n\nOf the 5 MBTI tests I’ve taken, 3 times were ENFJ, once ENFP and once ENTJ. In case that helps any. 
3	Oh yeah, I relate heavily to that. Heck, I'm in college and I *still* feel it. I believe what you're referring to is known as "Sunday neurosis". It gives me that feeling where I can't really start a new project or do much, just because I know I'm on a limit before the work week begins. 
3	I think that's not an ENFJ thing, I'm sorry for the lack of a better delivery. It just sounds like anxiety -- you had 2 days off for weekends, and you need to prepare to go to work/school again... At least that's how it is for me. \n\nDreading Monday not because it's Monday, it's because Monday is the day after the 2 days weekend. I'm sure this will repeat if someone's off day is not Saturday and/or Sunday.
2	I can have absolutely experienced this and it lasted throughout all of my schooling starting in elementary school. I would end up staying awake until 4 am.  I had many friends and did well in school but this wave of anxiety would just wash over me sometime around dinner time.  Ive taken the test several times throughout my life and I’ve gotten ENFJ most of the time, and a couple times ENFP.
2	That’s not enfj, it, like most things, is just typical human feels. Monday blues. Responsibilities. \nAnxiety and all that Jazz. Hi Monday
2	For sure! I’m in my third year of college and I get this anxious feeling every Sunday night haha. It’s mostly because my Mondays are busy and I always feel like I’m not prepared for the day which gets me anxious. Plus I don’t like losing all that leisure I sinned into over the weekend haha
2	Feels like anxiety more than ENFJ, but I'd say there's a heavy correlation between ENFJs and anxiety (I definitely have it in spades, mostly social anxiety. And it crops up here often). \n\nI would recommend trying melotonin (body generates it naturally, so it's a fairly common supplement). I take 15 mb every night and it's helped immeasurably. Wish I'd known about this solution in middle school/high school/college, would have saved me so many sleepless nights (and most of the social failures in life I can relate back to sleep deprivation, when I draw anecdotal correlation lines. It's a huge effect and worth seeking help on). \n\nI also have a friend who chases a magnesium supplement with cherry juice (which contains tryptophan, the thing in Turkey that makes you sleepy). Seems to work for her. \n\nMy letter jacket in high school had the phrase 'Sleep is for losers' on the back, if you want an example of how much of a problem this was for me (at the time I took it as a point of pride, ahhh the ignorance of youth). 
2	I'm not sure if this is an ENFJ-exclusive phenomenon, but now that I think about it, I can definitely relate! Though, I believe I attributed it typically to the Monday blues and start of the week. \n\n\nI miss childhood so much. Give your son a hug for me! Tell him not to be in a rush to grow up, enjoy it while it lasts, kiddo! :)
1	Since it is anxiety related, a good solution is to come up with some mental strategy to psych yourself out of it. I focus on good memories of the people I will be seeing the next day.  Melatonin also helps.  \nUse alarms to remind yourself when to wake up and also when to wind down in preparation for sleep. \nTalking about how I feel also helps to put things into perspective.\nI’m still a night person, and I don’t think that’s ever going to change.

5	Cant decide what I want in my love life	Im ENFJ, my boyfriend is INFP and my colleague ENFP.\n\nFive years ago I (F 34) relunctantly accepted a job In a large city. Previously I had lived my entire life in a middle sized town. I attended college there but job opportunities are pretty rare in this town. During college I dated a guy (m32) I met there but we never moved in together. When I accepted the job we agreed to stay together. Since then I spend every weekend with him. (I have to travel three hours to him.) During our vacations we travel together. When Im with him Im genuinely happy and I still love him. I have never cheated on him.\n\nBut Im tempted to. At work I have a colleague (M38) with whom I became close friends quickly after we met when I joined the workplace. And we are spending a lot of time together during and after work. I have found other friends at work too, but they are all not so close or female. In the last years I slowly fell in love with my colleague and from Monday to Friday we basically act like a couple, except that we never had any kind on physical relationship. But there is obvious sexual tension between us. Some of my friends told me that its obvious we are crushing hard on each other.\n\nMy colleague did not went on a single date since he met me, which is according to those who have known him before I met him in sharp contrast to his previous behaviour. (We met briefly after he had a breakup.)\n\nI think I love him and I feel that he loves me too, but I also think that I still love my boyfriend. Another issue is that I want to have children, so I should find a solution and get married. But Im terribly afraid of marrying and settling down right now. But then again Im afraid that I will be too old to have children in a few years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR My heart is stuck between my boyfriend and a work colleague.\n\n&#x200B;
14	Funnily enough this is my one problem with ENFJs in relationships. You form connections with so many people you're almost guaranteed to find someone you gel with better than your current partner.\n\n>"When Im with him Im genuinely happy and I still love him. I have never cheated on him"\n\nI don't know if it's possible for this to be the case and for you to have enough room in your romantic life to want something else. Ask yourself, are you really satisfied with your current boyfriend? Do you want to be the mother of his and your children? \n\nMaybe you're just nervous about taking the next step in life with your current bf, it's hard to tell. However, if I were you I would re-examine my life and what is most important to me.\n\nGood luck, sounds shitty.
11	You’re not in love with your boyfriend if you’re considering cheating on him or leaving him for another man. \n\nThis is the very antithesis of love. \n\nTake that however you wish. \n
6	My first instinct would be to break up with your boyfriend and date the ENFP guy.\n\nHowever, I think it's important to be objective about your level of compatibility with both people. For instance, which guy shares your future goals? Do both men share your values and beliefs? Do both men actually want to live together, marry and have children? I would also ask, why didn't you move in with the INFP guy? Is he reluctant to marry and have kids? \n\nIt might be helpful to sit down and actually write down a pros and cons list regarding the compatibility with each guy. Seeing a therapist to talk through it might also be useful. Getting in touch with your gut is also important. What is your body telling you? When you imagine being in a relationship with each guy long-term, how does your gut and body feel?\n\nKeep in mind it's also possible that you may not be truly compatible with either of these men in the long run, but it may be giving you an indication that your current relationship is not working.\n\nMy hunch from what you shared is that the INFP guy is afraid of commitment and maybe doesn't share your desire to marry or have kids, though I may be mistaken. I'm just reading between the lines and wondering if he is not as invested as you are, or just has different future plans.\n\nHaving said all that - I do think it's possible to genuinely romantically love two people at once. I am in a polyamorous relationship so I know it can happen. However, if you want to be monogamous or feel more naturally monoamorous, then it may be worth considering what is missing in your current relationship.\n\n&#x200B;
27	Tired of feeling	I wish I could just make it stop.\n\nEdit: Thanks guys. You are truly the best. I know we all have our highs and lows but I feel like ENFJ's feel then a lot more then the typical person.  I'm just getting out of a long term relationship and a loved just passed so the loneliness is just hitting me hard. I appreciate all your kind words and advice. You make the world a better place ❤
16	We have all been there. Everything gets better\n<3
9	Wanna hear a joke?
8	I hope your days are feeling sunnier. <3\n\n :(           ---->           :D
9	Tired of feeling in what way? I can relate to emotional exhaustion so I'm interested in hearing your side 
6	Alright I’m not supposed to talk about this but... alien weed. They sell it around Area 51 deep in the heart of Nevada. Works like a charm; cures everything. (Btw this convo never happened)
5	Me literally always 
4	I just recently started therapy, recommended if you haven't tried it. I used to think the fact I was paying for someone to help me vent/work through feelings would ruin it, but truly money is a much smaller cost than suffering alone or trying to work on it with friends (as that leads to facing being expected to channel their own feelings or rejection or other expectations).  \n\nAnti anxiety drugs help too. Took 4 tries with some making it worse but I think I found one that works. 
3	Hey there, I'm going through a similar feeling but I've bounced back. I'm not back to my full level of being myself but I'm slowly getting back. \n\nDo you need to vent, want advice or need internet hugs? ✨🙏 \n\n
2	INTP here, so I'm not as good in helping in these situations as you would most likely have been to yourself. But i do feel the need to remind you that getting some help is nothing to be ashamed of if you have not tried it yet. Im feeling quite content with my life for a while now, with the occasional dips as we all have. I'm thinking about using ny universities free therepy sessions in any case, because your mental hygiene is just as important as looking after any part of yourself. Maybe you just need to say or hear the right set of words that will get you out of this feeling. I wish i knew the answer to your problem, but I'm sure if you look long enough you will find it out there, just stay strong for as long as you can. 
1	Man I feel this so much, I wish I could make it stop. I sometimes wonder what it would feel like to not feel anymore or at lest not so strong. 
27	Dealing with Hypersensitivity(/Negativity)?	So I'm realizing more and more that I get incredibly bothered by negative/bad encounters with people. A few examples being:\n\n* Receiving a bad comment/vitriol online\n* Dealing with impatience or rudeness\n* Getting into a fight with someone\n* Seeing someone get mistreated\n\namong other things.\n\n\nI'll end up stewing on it for a while, and sometimes, it can ruin my whole day. I try so hard to just shrug it off, but to no avail. I think it may be due to the fact that I can't just fathom the motivation behind such behavior? ("Why are you like this, if it costs absolutely nothing to be like this?!") Does anyone else struggle with this? Is this an ENFJ thing? 
22	We are sensitive peeps.\n\nI’m a 6’3” full grown man. Purple belt in Jiu Jitsu. And I can bench 280 lbs, yet if someone emotionally shows some disdain or hostility it gets to me... I freeze and I dwell on it for hours. \n\nI think it is a strength to be sensitive to those moments. But it can present some challenges, particularly at work...\n\nAll the best to you. 
9	I have definitely had a few encounters that have left me upset for hours, wondering "*WHY* did they do that??" As good as I am at letting things roll off my shoulders, it's definitely hard sometimes. \n\nA couple of things I tell myself in situations like this:\n\n* Everyone is going through something. Their journey might have been/is much harder than yours right now and they aren't good with handling it. \n* If you did everything right in the situation and someone was still rude, it's not your fault. \n* Some people are genuinely just assholes.\n\nWhen I think of all of these things, the outcome is ultimately: I can't do anything to change how that person is, what they did to me, etc. What I CAN control is how I react. I don't want to let some asshole control my emotions for any amount of time. Take 5 big breaths, exhaling the negativity and move on as best as you can. Took me a long time to realize these things & I still have trouble sometimes. I hope this helps:)
7	I think it's more than hypersensitivity.  I think it's an acute understanding of people's failure to attend to Fe principles as they ought.  The very thing that you are specialists at being Fe-doms.  Fe is the ultimate social force, it knits communities and individuals together with the type of warmth, kindness and mutual support that gives people a reason to live (IMO love gives people reason to live more than intellect or material gains or status).  Most people fail to consider other people's feelings, and your reaction is probably in proportion to the destructive effect this has on others.  Like, there's a darn good reason 1/4-1/3 of people in our societies are lonely, there's a reason people commit suicide, there's a reason families and communities breakdown. It's because we seem to spend half the time hacking and cutting at each other verbally, and disliking each other, and protecting our egos rather than thinking empathetically.  So pointless when we could live in harmony and build each other up.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other factor is that as I understand it, your heart is really on your sleeve being Fe-dom, in that your Fe is scouring the world around for feedback on your character and performance as a person, and negative feedback cuts you deep when it comes at you.  I'm not certain on this, but developing your Fi might permit you to better perceive that other people have a whole host of personal feelings and reasons to cut others down or treat them with hostility, and 99% of them are no accurate reflection on your character whatsoever.  Most of them are a reflection on their personal integrity, their happiness or lack thereof, and their inadequacy/jealousy in the light of your apparent positivity.  People are strange.
1	I wouldn't describe myself as hypersensitive but I've basically accepted the past few months that I'm emotionally needy but am fucking terrible at communicating it. I don't want to burden someone when I'm better at helping them. It sucks but I'm pretty good at stuffing my sensitivities and the emotional pay off for helping someone at my expense is a greater pay off of happiness for me. I recently described it to someone as I'd sacrifice half of my daily happiness to make my wife and kids even only 1% more happy ( I have no wife and kids, no gf either just giving an example)
0	It's so annoying when a small comment or minor thing can destroy your whole day. But there is a solution that I have tested and it worked wonders! It's extremely powerful for anyone that is trying to understand own emotions which helps in every aspect of your life. \nRead the book "The Chimp Paradox" by professor Steve Peters. Or even better, before buying the book, or e-book as I did, look it up on youtube and you will understand what a gem this book is. \n\nThis book helped me in so many different ways it's unbelievable and it's especially good for us, ENFJs.\n\nEnjoy! 😊
3	Do we ever truly change MBTI types?	Would just like to premise this saying that I consistently type as an ENFJ when taking MBTI tests, and this is further reflected through similarly inclined enneagram tests.\n\nIn the last year of my life, I feel like I have been forcing myself to a degree to change as a person to better benefit my life, which means acting for myself when I would have previously acted to help others. This was so that I would feel a better sense of control over my life and enjoy myself more in social situations, following 'self-therapy' where I would go for long walks and think about why I didn't feel happy with who I was.\n\nDuring this time, I felt myself 'change' mentally as I encouraged myself to think another way, and as a result, I felt like I was becoming less like an ENFJ and something closer to an ESTP or an ESFP, something I accepted as part of me improving my life.\n\nFast forward a year to now, and I have better adopted these practices into my life, not giving mindlessly to others just so that they would think better of me, and admittedly I do feel better about who I am and my situations for a number of reasons. That being said, I have been thinking back on my day-to-day thoughts and behaviors and realized that, no matter how many times I had gotten used to not offering help to others or not caring if a person had been left out, I always still thought about this occurrence and wanted to do what I believed to be right. To help, provide and believe in others when doing so meant nothing to me.\n\nNo matter how hard I tried to change my behaviors and state of mind, I am not able to remove that part of me that makes me an ENFJ. \n\nAnyone else here had a similar experience? Anyone able to change their MBTI type through sheer force of will, or is it simply a process that may occur circumstantially through events in our lives?
11	the two penny version is no, you are who you are. INTJs can dance, and ESFPs can be analysts. it's about how you're wired and how you respond to things and how you see the world. what you DO isn't directly necessarily related. for instance you'll always be a feeler, but feelers can be good at thinking and in the habit of thinking.\n\nthe complicated answer is trauma does rewire the brain in terms of neuron pathways. some are newly burned into place and some burn out and stop working. if your degree change was precipitated by something truly horrible and personal, then yes you can change fundamentally.\n\n
7	I took the test 5 years ago and got ENFP. Took it again last month and got ENFJ.\n\nSimilar personalities, but still different. I think people can change over time. Maybe not drastically, unless there is major trauma, but I have noticed changes in myself naturally over that 5 year span between taking the test.  I do fit more into the ENFJ category now than the ENFP one, based on descriptions, but 5 years ago ENFP was a better fit for who I was at that time.
3	I’ve taken the test many times and get ENFJ every time. That’s my case.
3	I’ve read before that your personality can change but more than likely will change within the same temperament. ENFJ’s are diplomats/idealists, and so are ENFP’s, INFP’s and INFJ’s. Intuitives think very differently from sensors (thinking more about opportunities vs. the present and what’s practical), so it’d be interesting for someone to completely change this fundamental personality trait, but I suppose it could happen over time.
3	I’ve been wondering this myself. I did the test when I was around 17 and got ISFJ and thought I related to it and didn’t think of myself as an extrovert. I was very guarded around new people and quiet. Among my friends though I was a different person. Happy, bubbly, organising activities and giving advice. \n\nFast forward to after some significant trauma over a few years, counselling and re-evaluating my life and myself I reread the ISFJ profile and didn’t connect with it. I retook the test and got ENFJ.\n\nAt first I thought this trauma must have changed my personality as my support system pretty much disappeared and I had to be proactive and more open and trusting as I was very lonely and wanted to connect with new people. Instead of reserving the bubbly honest side for my friends only, I put my walls down and wanted everyone to see the real me.\n\nLooking back and getting to know other ISFJs I actually think I have been an ENFJ all along. I felt I was an introvert because I was quiet and got used to being alone, but I hated every minute of it. I felt stifled when I couldn’t be myself and had this stoic mask. When I was with my friends I felt happy carefree and alive. I can’t go for days without social interaction. If I was stuck at home (strict parents) I’d always be reaching out to talk to someone on phone or msn or message boards. \n\nPeople who aren’t in my life now could not handle me as an ENFJ. Me wanting to please them caused me to put on a more introverted mask and dull down a lot of my personality and caused me to bottle up a lot of thoughts and dreams. \n\nI used to have dreams where I would have wings, but I was chained, or my feathers would fall out or they would be broken if I tried to fly. \n\nI’m 30 now and only just feel like I am finally able to be who I have been all along and be accepted for who I am. In my dreams now my wings are powerful and strong :) I’m happy.
3	Years ago I took the MB test at work and I was an INFP. I entered a really difficult phase of my life shortly thereafter and in the space of several years I was diagnosed with cancer, my wife (now ex) increasingly abused and gaslighted me, I lost my family, and I lost my job. \n\nI slowly rebuilt myself, and it took several years of therapy to do so, but I am now an ENFJ. So my thought is yes, you can change personality types. 
2	Yes, time changes everything once you’ve spent enough of it.
2	No. Type is hardwired and immutable. However the MBTI types are not the real world types and only correlate to them about 50%. The real world types with rough MBTI labels are the following:\n\n* INTP\n\n* INTJ/ENTP\n\n* ENTJ\n\n* SF\n\n* ENF\n\n* INF\n\n* IST\n\n* EST\n\n* (Type is not covered by the MBTI).\n\nAs you can see, J and P are mostly a label for subtypes rather than types. Subtype and other aspects of personality can change. Type never can.
2	The first time I ever took this test ( around 6 years ago) I was an ENTP. I have personality traits from both tbh, some traits or quirks don't stick and some I eerily relate to. 
1	Analytical Observations On My ENFJ BFF That May Help Non-ENFJs	That’s probs a presumptuous title XD sorrys! I just came to a revelation, got excited, and I wanted to share to see if it’s correct. Please, ENFJs, correct me if I’m wrong and tell me if these observations are NOT type related.\n\nAfter 7 months, I’ve finally discovered my ENFJs behavior pattern. You do not know how much joy this brings me XD Note: I am NOT joyous over his pain - just that I can see the pattern so I can be there for him the way he needs me to be.\n\nI am his closest friend. It is NOT easy to be close to an ENFJ! At first, he was very kind, charismatic and complimentary. We’d hang out every few weeks and maybe message every three days. He was super nervous in person and later admitted I intimidated him (in a good way XD). Then, slowly he pulled me into his world. VERY slowly. VERRRRRRY slowlyyyyyyy. He had to be in control of all our interactions, contact increased over months but only on his terms - example: I was not allowed to officially meet his other friends with him present even tho I actually knew some of them separately, haha! He’d disappear every so often and I’d send an affirming, positive or motivational meme to let him know I still thought he was awesome and was there if he needed me. Sometimes he would heart it, sometimes he’d ignore it (I’m just noting for data points, not cuz it worried me XD). In the beginning, he’d return with an apology that he was busy and I always replied with, “No worries! As long as I know you’re alive.” We’d talk a bit then go do our own thing. \n\nContact increased, plans for us to merge businesses began, formal politeness decreased as our interactions became more casual, nervousness decreased. Sometimes if we did things TOO in synch and felt TOO connected, he’d disappear the next day.\n\nThen some emotional drama stuff happened with his ex but I still stuck around because I am his friend above anything else. I learned about Love Languages and increased my Words of Affirmation to him. He began to trust me and refer to us as “we” and “us”. \n\nThen one day he called me, a bit distraught. A business contact had angered him by calling him incompetent. He. Went. Off! He tried to make a few jokes but I think when he saw I was unbothered by his tone,  he unleashed his full feelings about the guy. Wow. Holy crap. ENFJ rage is NOT a joke! He screamed - literally screamed - at the top of his lungs. It was kinda hawt :P Afterwards, he started whining but in a cute way that melted my thick candy shell, then thanked me profusely. I think that’s when things changed between us and we grew closer. That was a month ago. \n\nFor two weeks after we were inseparable. He seemed ridiculously happy/stable. He started to introduce me to his friends, make sarcastic jokes at my expense (my fav kind!) and tag me in things publicly. We had a more than friendly hug that was pretty sweet. Then he started showing his jealous side. As an INTP female, I’m sought after by the peeps in our geek/tech world and he is ridiculously uncomfortable with it - even tho we’re just friends ;). The jealousy was kinda cute until I started realizing it was stemming from low self esteem. The more his wall crumbled before me, the more I started to see just how low his self esteem is. I did a social media post to bump his ego up and he did NOT like that! He eventually said that basically he didn’t like being told he was awesome with nothing to show for it; he felt undeserving. Another ego hit happened from someone else. He started getting very condescending to me. Then, he made a mistake in scheduling and ended up having to be awake for three days to make a deadline. He called and shouted at me. Then apologized. I forgave him. He called the next day cuz I needed a friend to talk to but instead of comforting, he screamed at me for like ten minutes. He didn’t apologize this time. We said bye and he disappeared to sleep. He then frantically messaged me at 4am w/manic ideas then apologized. I sent him a message the next day that said, basically, that we were both stressed but that I was here for him and we were still a team. No response. We were supposed to go to a thing together, so he asked me to call him to wake him up. He never answered. I messaged a few times, he read every one but no reply. Here’s where I DID start to get a bit nervous XD I finally broke and asked if he was mad at me. Whoa! Immediate, apologetic reply and a 2 hour phone call (my love language is Quality Time) where he basically said I never needed to worry. He wasn’t ghosting (his ex and my ex ghosted, so we’re both sensitive to that) and there was always a good reason if he didn’t reply. I realized that he just needed to sort through some stuff alone.\n\nObservation: ENFJs “disappear” to process internal stuff solo and it’s a long process. As an INTP, I am constantly internalizing thoughts all day. I can do it in a crowd of people or alone. If you’re close to an ENFJ, they are going to disappear but WILL come back and it has nothing to do with you personally. \n\nMy developed response to this pattern: let them know you’re there and still love them but leave them alone till they come back.\n\nIs this even remotely correct for ENFJs?? XD \n
8	The seclusion aspect and apologizing is very accurate to me. I want people to ask me questions and have me open up if I have a problem because I don’t want to seem needy to that person. \n\nMy worst quality is I’ll tend to distance myself from people I’m attracted to if I feel like I’m about to catch feelings. But at the same time I’m still attracted to them and will act cold and rarely talk to them even if we’re in the same space. If they come up to me and talk, I’ll internalize my feelings and say things like “I’ve just been busy” 
5	No
2	[deleted]
2	I think I would rather be in company and able to share whatever it is that I'm feeling or stressing over ... I (sometimes, most times) don't because it's unfamiliar territory and it becomes a mental game of jenga or dominoes, with feelings and emotions, that aren't your own.\nI would rather every one around me be content, happy, satisfied, etc ... over myself; that backfires more times than not. Ironically, even though my focus is undivided on the person, they feel it's the exact opposite, and that's when the wedge becomes cemented :|
1	I took the big five test, didn't give me a result with a letter. I'll take another later on. Hoping I get a T lol
2	Pretty damn close to me. Wish I had a lady friend like you lol.\nENFJ-T here. Anyone know what the T stands for? 
5	Experiences/Advice on studying abroad as an ENFJ- how to find your people, and make the most out of studying abroad?	Hey everyone! I apologize in advance for my long ranting lol. So I [F21] am studying abroad in Florence, Italy this semester and while it has been nice, I feel like there is also a big part of me that is really having a tough time. I am missing my boyfriend, family,  and friends dearly, and have been flooded with random bouts of anxiety and depression. I know that this is all apart of culture shock, but I feel that it is more than just that.\n\n As apart of my study abroad program, I live with three other girls in an apartment- they are nice and friendly but I feel like I don't "click" or bond with them at all. All they want to do is go out and drink, and that is not me, nor will it ever be, especially since I'm in another country and don't want to put myself in harm's way. Just not really a fan of drinking or the bar scene, it makes me anxious- I'll drink with close friends or my boyfriend but that's about it. Anyway, back to what I was saying, I'd much rather go out and experience everything else that Florence has to offer, as opposed to drinking.\n\nMy roommates are also very "cliquey" and I don't feel like I am "one of them" or that they actually want to include me in things. They do try to include me in things, and one of my roommates even wants to travel with me at some point, but I feel like it's always as a second thought. It's just little things that they do that make me feel like this, such as walking ahead of me, taking pictures with each other but not asking me to take pictures with them unless it's a group shot, not including me in conversations, the way they talk to me etc. I know for a fact that they have a group chat with other girls in the program without me in it where they make plans to go out (could be because they all have iPhones and I have an android, or maybe they sense I don't like going out but I was never even asked if I wanted to  be included in the chat). I don't know, maybe I am just overreacting (please call me out if I am) but this honestly all really hurts me and makes me feel incredibly isolated, sad, and lonely. It doesn't help either that my roommates are extra infatuated with the bar scene because they are all under 21 and can't drink back in the US. I also feel that they are kind of immature, which I can't stand. I have tried to socialize with my roommates as well as the other girls they hangout with outside of our apartment,  but I find myself feeling incredibly out of place and awkward with nothing to say everytime we're in a large group, so I usually end up just being quiet most of the time. Their conversations are annoying and uninteresting to me, and I struggle to contribute to their conversations, since I don't share interests with them, even though I wish I could.\n\nI am doing my best to try to just enjoy my study abroad experience regardless of the people, but as an ENFJ, I crave to have the company of at least one other person who "gets" me. I'd much rather be exploring Florence with other people, rather than by myself. Fortunately, I think I may have found one girl in my program who will be my "go to" but I still can't stand the feeling of feeling alienated from the people I live with. \n\nSo what do I do? I don't know if I should just force myself to be uncomfortable and go out to the bars with my roommates in order to get that social interaction I desire, or if I should just do my own thing and hangout with other people I meet outside our apartment. But how do I even meet other people? For those of you who have studied abroad,  how did you make the most of your study abroad experience, and can you shed some light on any of the things I am experiencing at the moment?\n\nAny insight would be appreciated, thanks! :-)
3	I was in your place when I studied abroad. It was hard being away from family and the boyfriend. I think what’s important is to try to communicate and being open and honest. They’ll be appreciative of that and supportive.\n\nAs for finding friends, it also took me a while. Everyone in the program was really friendly so I got to know different people and hung out with them, but didn’t feel that strong connection. I think it was weeks into the program that I actually found someone I really connected with. She became my closest friend in the program, but we also had our differences (she liked to go out drinking and I didn’t so much).  So even though I knew I could talk to her, we didn’t end up doing everything together, and I think I preferred that. I would sometimes go to places by myself (if it was safe) or I’d find other people in the program who were interested. In these study abroad programs, most people are going to want to explore. Find some places you want to visit and see if anyone else in your program wants to join. If you plan it, most people probably would want to just tag along.\n\nI once planned a trip thinking it would just be a small group of us. Eventually, people in the program started hearing about it and nearly the entire program went on the weekend trip with us. It was so much fun and everyone was so appreciative that I planned it for them.\n\nEven if it’s not people in your study abroad program, maybe you can try to find some locals you can hang out with (try couchsurfing, Airbnb experience, meet ups, etc). \n\nHope you enjoy your study abroad experience. Best of luck to you. ❤️
2	I’m also an ENFJ and let me tell you, it’s not you. I may not be studying abroad now but most of my family lives in Germany and I travel to see them, plus I’m at college away from my usual family and friends. \nWhile I have a few friends here, not everyone is nice-and most of the time it’s because they’re either too shallow, judgmental, or something of the like that I don’t stoop down to either. In your case it sounds like both. But it could also be jealousy, I can’t tell. Don’t let them change you, I for sure don’t think you should force yourself to be someone different in order to fit in. \nAs for studying abroad and making the most of it, speak the language! When in Rome, right? So make friends with people who are branching themselves out in a way that you admire, possibly Italian-born ones at that. You’ll have friends to come back to when you visit!
2	I studied abroad in France and actually ended up meeting a lot of my good friends whom I still travel to see, several years later, through international students' Facebook groups (if you're in Europe there's most likely an Erasmus group). Two of my friends specifically I met because they wanted to find language partners for linguistic tandems. As an ENFJ I also love helping others, so I made some great friends from my home country just by offering my help with things like navigating the city and banks and life abroad! I ended up travelling with all of these friends as well and it was great! Don't be afraid to go meet people outside your program and apartment; if you don't enjoy hanging out with your roommates then don't force yourself. This semester is about you and your experiences!
0	Hard time with some one Bi-polar	I was wondering ENFJ's. I am bi-polar and it is managed very well but sometimes i cry for no reason or have small episodes. Can you guys handle being with someone like that or do you avoid it at all costs? 
2	Depends on the person. Mbti does not influence who anyone is interested based on mental health. Personally, I wouldn't be equipped to handle someone who has any sort of mental stuff going on. I dated someone with depression before and felt like they would use their depression to guilt trip me into doing stuff. Or they would excuse bad behavior with that mental illness. 
1	I’ve never been with anyone bipolar so I can’t say with certainty but I have known bipolar people. I think it depends on how it manifests itself ... I can manage strong emotional swings from others unless there’s a lot of negative feelings directed at me during an episode. Once someone hurts me badly enough it’s extremely hard for me to trust them ever again and, for my own sake, I’ve had to learn to walk away when that happens.  
1	No to most of those
1	bipolar or borderline?\n\nyou’re soudns like borderline 
7	Enfjs are you guys romantics??	ENFJ s are you guys romantics? When you are what is a behavior that you do with only the person you are in love with? What is different between people you are clos with and your special someone?
10	Being too romantic is something I've worked hard to stop doing. In general people take advantage of this trait in my experience. Now I fight against that instinct with all my might and it works ok... haven't dated someone in like 2 years though.
5	I’d say I’m not super romantic, but I show love with words of affirmation (we tell each other something we love about each other from the day every night). I also enjoy doing nice things for my husband like bringing him home dinner or cleaning out his car. \n\nI have done romantic things like set up valentines scavenge hunt or a candle lit massage after a hard week, but it’s not something I do super regularly. 
3	Im a romantic in the way that I looove cheesy one-liners. For example if my girl says "sorry don't let me distract you" I will typically answer "you are my favourite distraction" and wink at her. Stuff like that I do a lot and she often calls me a cheese factory for that reason.\n\nWhen it comes to romantic gestures like flowers or breakfast in bed or offering my jacket when it's cold I'm less inclined. I am also super bad at keeping secrets and for that reason I struggle a bit with surprising her, even when it comes to birthday/christmas or anniversary gifts.
2	My girlfriend and I are both ENFJ's and we both like to be romantic in different ways. \n\nShe is very much so a gift giver and likes to dote on me, while I like to do acts of service and support her in other ways. 
2	I feel the world has taught me to not follow my inherent romantic nature.
2	I’m low-key romantic. The best kind of romance is the kind that’s most genuine-so like if a person who’s not usually romantic makes an effort, that makes my heart soar. I don’t think I require anything other than knowing that the person is making an effort. But yes. A tad. \n
1	Definitely. Trying to fight not being hopeless though. I still haven't been in a relationship yet... :( But I'm beginning to actually consider the possibility that I might be polyamorous. Definitely have a lot of love to give.
1	I like my partner to feeled loved and I like to feel loved. My wife needs quality time and I need touch. I don't like to be touched that much from people I don't like. \n
15	Being an ENFJ...	Hey, fellows Me's. What style of music do you all like?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep it... you.
10	Pop, rock, and musicals. Also love EDM especially trance music. I also go to raves when I can and the energy there is just amazing! 
9	MINOR CHORDS! They pull at my heart and make my brain synapses fire. \n\nDeath Cab for Cutie for their creeping crescendos.   \nGreg Laswell for his minor chords and bass voice.   \nBon Ivor, Novo Amor...  \n
4	Synthwave and Electronic chill out music like Boards of Canada and Tycho
3	I waver between ENFJ and ENTJ myself.\n\nMy music preferences depend, but I tend toward a  Heroic playlist of music that makes me feel empowered. That and one called FIGHT!\n\nLately it's varied from one called Chill Music No Vocals to one called Listen for the Drum Break.
2	Boards of Canada, Tipper, Hullabalo0, Manchester Orchestra, Grateful Dead
2	 Love listening to movie soundtracks and TV. Game of thrones, West world, infinity war, oceans 11, Harry Potter, lord of the rings. I was also in orchestra for 12 years so it has a special place in my heart. \nBut I also love country and used to be into EDM a lot more so than I am now. Alternative. A little bit of everything I suppose. 
2	Depeche Mode \nA place to bury Strangers \nHealth\nNine inch nails. \n\nEtc. 
2	I'm into rock, I play blues guitar though. But really, anything that gives me this feeling (I can't explain) which is sort of inspiring. I think ENFJs will like Minus the Bear who are a prog/electronic/math rock/acoustic band. \n\n&#x200B;
1	Everything.\n\nEDM and country are my favs rn though
1	Hybrid, electronic, futuristic, orchestral, epic, dramatic, sad, indie, alternative, constantly adapting to new tastes forever at the moment...
1	Future ravebaes wya
1	Indie, bossa nova, lofi, jazz, alternative rock.
1	I think i listen to almost every single genre, except metal. Don’t know why it doesn’t ressonate with me.
1	Right now I'm mostly into prog metal. I feel it has the perfect amount of depth and  somewhat of a hypnotizing effect and I can pretty much dive into the music and ignore everything else when I need to. \n\nOtherwise mostly some form of rock or metal, but in the end the genre isn't really important, I can like any song for any reason, be it music or lyrics or simply feelings. \n\nSomething I wish to get more into are atmospheric soundtracks or soundtracks in general. So far I occasionally listen to the soundtracks of Deus Ex (HR/MD) , Witcher 3 oder Interstellar. :) 
1	Everything ranging from Modern rock to metal, and a healthy springling of post-rock and post-metal. I like it when they tell me how they REALLY feel, basically :D
1	I totally love Lofi Emo, Bedroompop and Anti-Folk like AJJ, Salvia Palth, Teen Suicide, Neutral Milk Hotel, Snail Mail or the Moldy Peaches 
15	Unhealthy ENFJ Example	
5	This scene is from a movie called The Graduate. Notice the use of Ti-Fe to keep the situation going, as well as Mrs. Robinson's strong understanding of Benjamin's thoughts and feelings. 
5	impressive find!
6	Hey ENFJs are you Male or Female?	So many posts about ENFJ related questions or answers, but so many of them are from female perspectives, which is cool. As a guy though I do sometimes want to hear from the males as well. Since males are often taboo'd against for being "too emotional" as well against other things ENFJs are known for I was hoping to hear a lot from them too. It's hard to find posts on here sometimes from that perspective sometimes. :p\n\nThough after reading all the female perspectives, I wish I knew more ENFJ women personally!\n\nBut yeah, am I a rare breed being an ENFJ male? 
4	I did not realize there were few male ENFJs. Maybe that’s why I have so many female friends lol
3	Male here.  We are a rare breed indeed!
3	Lady here 🙂
2	Maybe rare but I’ve seen a few more of us on here!!
2	2% of male population, so I guess pretty rare
2	Female ENFJ with an ENFJ brother :)
2	Male, didn’t know it was rare
2	Male ENFJ here and I still don't fully know what it means or how I can better myself through knowing this. Lol
2	Yes
5	Why I'm I so worried?	Lately I can't get myself to sleep through an entire night. I wake up with my head feeling like a throught explotion had just occured, thinking about all kinds of crap. Kind of makes you feel insane, because you can't escape your own mind. I feel stressed above all, about my studies, but the thing is I have absolutely nothing to worry about? Do you guys think there might be something bothering me that I'm tooking past? What do you do when you feel stressed for no reason?
5	Hi! I have been having sleep issues since 8/12. Though mine is more related to PTSD, I would like to help because it took me awhile to figure out what it was and seek the correct help. Though I’m getting some sleep now it’s still not a full nights rest.\n\nI started meditating in the morning at then at night. I journal everyday, even if it’s not significant. I write a gratitude list as well. When you find activities that keep you presently focused this helps with anxiety about the future. I knit, bake, paint. \n\nOther things, if you can’t sleep after laying down for a half an hour - get up and go to another room and do a quiet activity for awhile and try to go back to sleep. I would read. \n\nMake sure your sleep hygiene is in check. No caffeine, alcohol, sugar. These things don’t help. Only use your bedroom for sleep. Stop using screens an hour before bed bc blue light can keep your mind active. Clean your bed sheets if you haven’t recently. Make sure your room is dark and cool, easy for sleep. Practice diaphragmatic breathing to try to help you go to sleep.\n\nEven doing all these things I still couldn’t sleep well. I went and saw my PCP and tried two different sleep aids. Neither helped. So then I went to a therapist and I’m starting to get a few rem cycles a night but still not a whole nights rest. It is getting better.\n\nBe careful not to beat up on yourself for sleep or it will get worse! It will become almost meta, I’m not sleeping bc I can’t sleep. Treat yourself with kindness. Focus on trying to rest rather than sleep. That can be equally as helpful. 
1	Well without getting too specific what are something going on in your life? Any big plans or just a lot of stuff going on?
1	I go visit her when ever I can, but she can't talk anymore, so I just sit there and try and decipher her attempts at forming words. She is not the person I knew througout my life, but I am still the same person to her, so I visit a lot. And also I'm ontly finishing the degree next year, but thanks though!
1	Melotonin helps me. Wish I'd found it sooner, so many restless night solved by a slight increase in something the body already produces (and is often recommended as a supplement). 
8	I’m an ENFJ my best friend is an ENFJ is it normal....	I’m an ENFJ and my best friend is an ENFJ is it normal for us to get annoyed with each other. She’s my best friend but there is times she just does certain things or acts a certain way and it drives me up a wall. I’m sure she would say a similar thing about me. Is it normal for similar personalities to clash like that? 
14	yea. sometimes the bad habits both of you share are basically magnified and the things that we find annoying about ourselves are reflected on us.  Also, it's also being too much alike that gets annoying after a while.
5	I actually usually dislike people who are exactly like me because it shows me all my annoying habits!
3	What you hate in others is what you hate about yourself. You may be blind to whatever this aspect is. I know I am. \n\nSimilarly, what you admire in others is what you already have :D
1	Yea, this is normal in my experience.  Whenever I see another INFP I either love them or am like \*eyeroll\* 'the position of pretentious wannabe-deep spiritual-statement-making art-making try-hard is already taken in this friend group/university/world ok?' Ha I exaggerate but yea...\n\nI watched a CS Joseph video on Youtube which suggests that we look for the corresponding opposite  functions in others to fulfil our needs (eg, Fi needs Fe to express it's feelings, Fe wants to read Fi's deep feelings); therefore when we are with our own type or sister type, our needs are actually nearly the furthest away from being fulfilled, because we're both like two plugs with no socket xD The only types that fill our needs less are our exact opposites in socionics, the STPs for you guys (STJ's for me).  That being said, happy friendships and romantic relationships exist between these types all the time, so it can definitely be worked on and made into something awesome.
19	Being alone	I live with my best friends, and today no one was home. I feel like I want to die! I can only draw so much, watch so much series, listen to so many podcasts and walk so many blocks. I've realised that I'm not even close to living alone! Do you guys also feel like you enjoy people way more than being alone? This is the extroverted part of our personality right? What do you guys do when you're alone?
20	This is so cute!\n\nIf you prefer being around people, then over-saturate your calendar with as many activities as possible so you can learn to appreciate the benefits of what little alone time you get.
7	ENFJ twenty-something Male - I also live with my best friends. Personally, I do really love living with friends. Often, though, I find that between work and living with them, I actually NEED to be alone in order to recharge. Between work and social things, I get super burnt out having such an inside look into others' lives all the time.\n\nPeople trust ENFJs so much that we are often confidants to friends and acquaintances alike and sometimes I need to hide in my room to make sure I give myself the recovery I need. Just my take!
7	I don’t know if this is helpful, but as an ENFJ I can’t relate at all. My Fe is constantly on overdrive, so people drain me. I consider alone time precious and try to maximize it as much as possible, because when people are around, I’m “ON” full-steam ahead meeting needs. Good luck with finding the right balance that works for you!
5	Yes!!\n\n100%\n\nI believe I am at the farthest end of extroversion you can possibly be.\n\nIt seems like I only need 1 hour of alone time per 7 days to "recharge" from people lol.\n\nIf you're looking for ways to enjoy being alone or making your alone time productive,  I've found several things that work well for me and could for you as well: \n\n* calling/texting a friend every 30 minutes or so\n* putting a show on silent and just letting it run on the TV in the background from whatever I'm doing\n* going on forums like reddit and commenting on stuff like I am now\n* having something planned with people later in the day so I have something to look forward to while I'm alone\n* set-up group texts with your various social circles so you know they're only a message away\n* put on music to have in the background of whatever you're doing - similar to the TV suggestion\n* make use of facetime/skype aside from calling and texting\n* change the location of where you spend your alone time--i.e. move around the house or visit a coffee shop etc.\n* take a break and read every 30 min or so\n* and lastly spending some time cooking! Even better if you listen to an audiobook or Music while you're at it. Or talking on the phone with a friend!\n\nMy main hobby while alone is writing, so doing the above helps keep my extraversion "charged," if you will, while I write
3	I totally agree!! I recently moved into my own place after living with friends for a few years and I was so scared I would run out of things to do and just be super bored. So far, it’s actually been amazing though!! It was like once I didn’t really have a choice I was like “oh yeah, alone time isn’t that bad” and I really appreciate it now. I write a lot, and I also call people on the phone or Skype and have conversations when I feel like I need to socialize!! 
1	I feel the same way! I also live with one of my best friends and if he's gone I've got maybe a two hour time limit on feeling "ok" before I have to leave to go be around people. I don't even want to socialize with the people I go to be around, just need to not be "alone". It's got to be the extrovert part... Anyone do that too? Go out to a public place to not be alone but not want anyone (strangers) to talk to you?? 
25	Am I Too Intense?	Have y’all found that the kinds of conversations you want to have with with others scares some people off and make them resent you and/or project their insecurities onto you to avoid connecting? I feel like I can’t have banal conversations easily and try to dig deep too quickly for some peoples’ comfort. Most find it immensely comforting, but I recently had an experience with a person where it intimidated them to the point of hostility, regardless of how much I backed off. Of course, being an ENFJ, this bummed me out. So I’m asking this here to see if anyone has any similar experiences? Is this an ENFJ thing?
11	I do! (INFJ) move swiftly past small talk and want to get to the good stuff, but a lot of people not interested, think I’m odd. Then I feel boring ... and I am bored in that situation and with the person and conversation. My favourite people to be around are the people that make me feel interesting not boring, who think it’s cool and are interested in and confident enough to jump into deep chat. Happy to do the small talk dance for a bit, I know it’s necessary sometimes! 
10	sometimes my enfj bff will act like you and he probably rants thngs about how the world will be dominated by robots, inequalities of the world and in my head i would like " calm down" ( No offense). Doesnt help because Im an isfj (sensor) haha. I would listen to his rant and hum all along\n\nYea, like an enfj, he can come off as intense but I dont mind because yes, in the future, robots will dominate the world.  Atleast the topics are not shallow.
6	Ouch, that's basically all I want to do, but people don't like that deep passion... :( Do you need a virtual hug, OP? :) - INFJ
4	God, I thought I was alone. It feels that way when people want to talk about the mundane. Is there a way to skip the small talk?
3	A lot of people like this about you! No need to change who you are based on a few bad experiences.\n\nDetermining when to show off this side of yourself could help dodge the hostility though. There are a few books I can think of that might help with this. \n
3	Are you me? \n\nI have so many feelings/thoughts and I just want to talk about them. I like conversations that make me think even if I don't immediately agree with their points. This definitely makes some people feel anxious. By the time I realize they are getting upset, it's too late. So then I try to fix it, and that often makes things worse.... sigh.
2	I have had similar experiences. I find shallow conversations rather exhausting in most cases and, as an added bonus, I am a ISTP. It is difficult for me to approach new people and when I feel that I have found someone interesting enough to approach them, it is hard to refrain from going deep. I highly value honesty and directness, but most of all openness; meeting my openness and desire for meaningful deep conversations with withdrawal, resentment and/or hostility hits me hard.\n\nAbout going deep, in a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/istp/comments/8gevgn/impressing_an_istp_male/dyb7lv1/) about how to impress an ISTP, u/acepincter summed it very nicely:\n\n>I may not speak for all, but as an ISTP like to see depth and passion and interesting things and to have my mind broadened with new ideas, perspectives and insights. Surface-level conversations rarely lead to any kind of growth or learning, though they may be entertaining.  We can hang around on the surface in social situations, but I get bored if the depth and interest isn't there in a partner. I want to see and understand how and why things work and people operate.  Going deep when necessary is not only welcomed, it is required.  \n>  \n>My stance is that there's so many interesting things in the world and in people, that if you don't know or can't find them to talk about, you probably aren't actually *interested* or passionate about those topics.  Maybe a lot of people aren't interested in life in general.  \n>  \n>Show me what you yourself *have found*.\n\nTherefore, the desire in people (in you :) ) to move the pleasantries aside and have meaningful conversations with each other is something that I admire.\n\nOh, /u/desbisousdesouci asked for the way to skip the smalltalk. With ISTPs, it is easy: just say "Let's skip the smalltalk, ok?" :D
2	Make 20s ENFJ. Small talk makes my brain shut down.  I find it easy to talk about deep intense stuff with people because I’m an intense extrovert but also quite shy. This makes me apear friendly and meek; a very approachable and unthreatening combination.  However, not everyone wants to talk about that stuff and it’s something you have to respect.  Openness does not come easy to a lot of people, but it is something that they can slowly work towards.  Be your intense self, but do not pry.
2	I don’t mean to detract. This reminds me of how I scared off an ISFJ female. We dated briefly and after 1 date she said that I seemed like “a lot” and that she was “weary of me” merely because I expressed enthusiasm for her and wanted to know more about her. It made me feel so weird and hurt, because in my mind I was just wanting to know more about her. \n\nPeople build up imaginary walls in an effort to guard themselves. I can understand why, but to me it seems like a gigantic waste of time. Life is short, I want to know your dreams and motivations. I want to talk about nuance, the future, how we better ourselves. I don’t have time to talk about the weather all day with someone I’m interested in (romantic or platonic). Don’t let these people convince you that you’re wrong, some people are compatible and some just aren’t. 
1	I love when my ENFJ bff gets all intense & bangs his fist on the table while talking because he believes so passionately in what he’s saying XD I wished he’d do it more! What’s funny is that if anybody else did that, I’d get so massively uncomfortable and disappear. I think it’s because he’s intense about deep subjects that we both believe in, whereas anyone else would just be bloviating about the weather or fuel prices.
7	I created a subreddit for MBTI Music stuff .... your presence is needed !	I've seen a few folks talk about music here and I have seen this as a common topic across many MBTI subreddits. So I made a subreddit -> https://www.reddit.com/r/MBTIRadioStation/ <- to see if others are interested in having more conversations on these two topics.\n\nI really don't know many ENFJ musicians .. but I will bet my life that Robert Plant(Led Zeppelin) is an ENFJ, Taylor Swift is an ENFJ and I have no doubt that [Hotel California](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99OKJaGSaYQ) came out of an ENFJ writer.\n\nI think each type is instinctively drawn to listen to its own type's music but I could be wrong. Feel free to post here -> https://www.reddit.com/r/MBTIRadioStation/ <- and please make your presence know with your ridiculous emojis :)\n
2	See you there. Also, Taylor is an ESFJ.
1	ENFJ drummer/multi-instrumentalist/vocalist in two bands here. I’ll definitely check this out! Also, thank you 😉
3	Request for Comments: "In Defense of Men, What's Left of Them - Present Day Feminism"	Greetings. INTJ here and I just wanted to know what female ENFJs make out of this:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT9jeK30yH8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT9jeK30yH8)  (warning: although easy to digest, the video is lengthy)\n\nI have some minor disagreements on some points she makes but overall I find her arguments pretty well-versed. What's your take on the topics she touches? Thanks in advance and looking forward to your feedback.
3	I finally got round to watching her! I think she’s onto something - probably TOO close to the bone because she was abused right off the internet, and had her safety threatened IRL. Often happens when you strike an uncomfortable nerve or try to expose people with buried agendas.  She’s got a very rational, observational approach and she is obviously approaching feminism from a point of view of her own, not what society has taught/brainwashed her with. I liked it very much, and it gave me a feeling that we need more voices expressing opposite viewpoints without screaming them down off the soapbox. A strong ideology/person can accept criticism, but weak ideologies/persons respond defensively using tactics such as ad-hom attacks, personalisation of issues, mockery and invalidation rather than addressing/considering valid counter points. 
32	Reframing your perspective?	Most of my life, a lot of my ENFJ traits have been viewed as negatives by family/friends. I’m accused of “overthinking everything” and “over analyzing.” I fall in love too quickly and too hard, and feel everything too strongly. I worry too much about other people’s problems, and how to fix/solve everything. I care too much about other people’s opinions.\n\nOr at least, that’s what I’ve been told, that I do it all “too much.” But the other day I had a lightbulb moment (while being accused of one of these things) and thought “Ok? And?” All of these traits are part of who I am, and yet they are being presented as negatives. I’ve actually languished about all these “awful” parts of my personality in the past and wished I could change. But the reality is, I don’t know that I would want to change them. I think I’m a pretty decent human.\n\nSo now I am in the process of changing my mindset from wishing to change my personality, to embracing/accepting it. Anyone else feel like this?
9	There are negatives, I do want to start by that. And this extends to all people, we all have aspects of ourselves we should try to improve or work on. For ENFJs it’s regulating our volatile emotional states. It’s all part and parcel of becoming an adult. It would be wise for ENFJs to be aware of this and make the necessary effort to change bad habits as not doing so may create turbulent relationships throughout your life. Another challenge for the ENFJ is their inferior function Ti which inhibits a certain self-awareness of shifts in emotional states. Basically this comes down to taking the emotional state to the next level but not knowing why or how it happens. You may be bothered by someone’s actions or behavior, let’s say at work, and it will be all-consuming, you won’t be able to get any work done for the remainder of the day. Or let’s say someone said something insulting, an enfj may also be more hurt than what is appropriate. An enfj may feel righteous to be hurt, vocalizing that hurt to their coworkers, and struggle to get over it. One may consider using [Ride the Wave](https://www.mindsoother.com/blog/riding-the-wave-of-emotions) dialectic behavior therapy to overcome this. The key is to practice mindfulness when this does occur, you can break the spell. \n\nThat being said, the buck ends at the excesses where it affects other people. Aside from that, this is *your* personality. Own yourself and who you are. Let people judge you if they need to. There is so much good that comes from the ENFJ personality and the quirks all make it very real and human. By accepting the negatives you will be able to eventually transcend them. So in the end can be geared and guided towards the positive. 
6	This resonates with me SO much. Thank you. 
7	I am also always accused for being too much. But for me, I just want to be loved and accepted for who I am. I do not want to change myself just to please other people. If I want to change, that will be from my own free will, and not to please others or to conform to their standards.
6	Absolutely!  There will always be people around telling you to be more like them, but they are probably wired different than you are. Just be the best you. It’s all you can do.
7	focus on the strengths and not your weaknesses.  Sometimes that will help you improve yourself.  Like positive reinforcement.  I've felt like this constantly in my younger years, but now I'm pretty firm on who I am and have the confidence to be who I want to be.  My overthinking is now my critical thinking and helps me solve issues and problems, this coupled with analysis of people and behaviors.  I've fallen in love hard with all my sig others and cherish most of them for their time and the lessons they've taught me.  I channel my feelings into something productive and help others.  Other people's opinions begin to matter less to me if it doesn't provide anything constructive.\n\nIt doesn't hurt to improve yourself as a person and to take the criticism if it's constructive.  There's always that fine line of trying to be someone your not vs thinking everyone else is wrong.  Only you can dictate what you want to be.
1	Good for you! As a fellow ENFJ, I’ve noticed that it’s far too easy to indulge others’ criticisms for fear of not empathizing with their point of view, which can tee them up to criticize us freely. I suspect the more we own our behavior, the more our confidence will deflect easy criticism. I feel constantly judged for being too nice, taking things too seriously, or whatever. I can take a cue from you and enact this “and your point is...” attitude more in my own life. Kudos.
1	Are you me?
5	ENFJ distant behavior in relationship	My ENFJ has been MIA for the past few days. We used to text a lot and call once in a while. 4 days ago he moved to a new city and when I try to contact him he ignores all my messages then randomly will send a message like "I am sorry I just woke up from a nap working a double again :/ how is your trip in florida" Then I think okay I get it he really is busy so I try to answer the question then text him randomly the next day ask if he made it to the new city he moved to safely, no answer. Then randomly after I tell him that I don't deserve to be ignored like this and it feels like I am being ghosted he says "Hey I'm really sorry, and i haven't been good at this because I'm in the middle of moving...but I'll call you tomorrow." Today is tomorrow and there is no call. What is with this behavior. Week ago he sent me a message  "..I really like you and I'm quiet when I first start to feel certain ways because I have trouble interrupting and never really know what I want to say until later. I'm slooww at this." . Is this whole situation freaking me out? I am so confused and at this point I dont know what to do. I know when he does if he does call I am going to tell him how I feel this is inconsiderate. 
13	ENFJs are quite purposeful, meaning they work on and do that which is most important to them. I don't know if you're in  disaster mode just yet, but his behaviour puts you as less important than the move.\n\nI was broken up with by an ENFJ, and unfortunately your guy's attitude is similar to hers before she broke up with me. Pure speculation, but he may be wanting to end the relationship if you continue to be a low priority 
7	Let the dude move! Moving is stressful; he’s feeling lost and alone and disoriented. He’s even been clear about why he’s been flaking and vulnerable about how he’s feeling. This dude needs your love and support right now. Let a dude move!
2	Guys you all are so helpful! I hope he calls and I get closure that is all I want. Would you guys do that
2	Hey. I feel that I relate to that guy. I am ENFJ and well this is atleast how I function.\n\nI moved out of my family home for the first time to a new city. I have a large family and we are very close. Also have many friends from the former city.\n\nWhen I moved. Everything is so new and there is so much to learn and to experience. I wouldn't call or text the people that were the closest to me. I still love them, but I am so focused on this new experience, and talking to them makes me feel like I'm still in the past. Maybe it's kinda selfish, but really don't take this personally. Don't get too clingy either, cause then I'll want to separate more because it makes me feel like you're holding me back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
1	You are absolutely right. It has only been a month but it was super deep and real when we were in it. I wasn’t stary eyes  about it either. I have many years of experience with relationships. So all the secrets and pillow talk and fun together and telling good friends and co workers about me meant a lot. 
1	How long does it usually take you to think about a no talking fight and contact your loved one
1	Wow this makes sense! I do hope he contacts me again. I know that I care about him deeply and I saw our connection. I still have to protect my self and let go hopefully he messages me soon
1	Any enfj's have a job reccomendation for a fellow enfj who seeks a happy medium between creativity and structure with no degree?	
7	I can think of a few, really stretching the definition of creative but let me see if I could help!\n\nHair stylist, makeup artist, business owner, masseuse, landscaping, gym trainer, construction, librarian, A/V technician, painter, glassmaker, youtuber. 
1	Im not sure your technical skill, but I would think that some sort of craft job could be enjoyable! Like profession table maker or something unique like designing novelty lights. Maybe you could macrame and sell them on Etsy? \n\nI know a lot of people who love that kindve thing. Good luck!
4	Confused Thinker Needs Feeler To Translate Recent ENFJ Incident	Sorry this is so long - I'm feeling VERY nervous! XD \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, my ENFJ (M/Enneagram 3/sp/sx) and I (F/INTP/Enneagram 5/sx/sp) are growing closer with each passing week. We're seven months into our friendship and nearly in communication every single day - either in person, via messages or phone calls. I have no doubt I am one of the most important - if not THE most important - person in his life and I respect that so deeply. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe recently got brave and tagged me in a social media post. It was a very polite, celebratory post that kinda publicly announced we are friends to everyone. He doesn't really like focused attention and, in his own words, is socially awkard. (You'd honestly never know ANY of that unless you got to truly know him as I have.) So I felt pretty honored :P Anyway, so the next day I was feeling warm and fuzzy. I decided to let my emotions take the lead and I posted an equally polite, celebratory AND complimentary post about him and tagged him in it. I thought he'd be elated as I was when HE did it XD\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWow. I was wrong. He saw the post and went completely silent. I asked him what was wrong and he said he wasn't sure he wanted our business contacts to know we were friends. (That was BS and I knew it, LOL!) So, I apologized and said I'd delete it. He said not to, threw a few sarcastic barbs out at me (these never phase me) and disappeared for about five minutes. I apologized again and said I was an asshat XD. He returned, in a COMPLETELY different mindset, and told me that he was sorry for his initial reaction and to get ready right then, he was taking me out to dinner. (We weren't even supposed to meet this week at all. Luckily, as an INTP, I'm up for anything last minute XD)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI...was...am?...very confused by his complete 180 degrees reaction. Anyway, dinner went well - he was VERY hyper, couldn't look me in the eye for too long and couldn't focus. He kept doing things for me, like grabbing napkins for me and getting me a drink and I felt super awkward about it but I didn't stop him. I then gave him a back rub in the cafe cuz he said his shoulder hurt; I've never touched him that much or for that prolonged amount of time or in public, haha! He didn't jump away like he has before when I reached out to touch his knee a few weeks ago. Then we walked home (we live in the same area) and he said, "I'm sorry about earlier. It's just...I've never had anyone just tag me in a post that says 'this guy is awesome' and I didn't know how to react." "Well, I'm sorry I did that without showing  you first." (Like, we ALWAYS engineer our social media responses together XD) Anyway, we said goodbye. Then, as the night wore on, he called me and then messaged me all night long about stuff that's not really that important about our current work project - all the way up until 3 am. He was absolutely manic. I'm always awake (I don't really sleep) but I was more worried about him because it was completely manic. His last message before he fell asleep was about meeting again this week. I agreed but it just confused me further (we had NO plans this week because we saw each other nearly everyday last week due to work - I even spent 8 hours at his apartment working on meeting notes! I never hang around anybody that long and don't suspect he does, either XD) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRando facts: He did hide the post from his timeline.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a Thinker, I'M SO CONFUSED RIGHT NOW!!!!!! All of this behavoir is very eratic and follows no practical pattern and makes no logical sense!!! Somebody - a Feeler - please translate :/ I'm worried about him but I can't pinpoint what is going on so I don't know how to diagnose, then fix the problem. I don't know if I effed up and ruined our friendship - I don't know if something else is bothering him or if I'm just getting to see the real him. I just want to hug him and tell him everything is going to be ok so he'll feel better - but I don't even know what 'everything' is XD What would send an ENFJ into a completely manic/anxious state? And can I fix it? Or do I just let it pass?? As a Thinker, I either want to fix the problem or I want to withdraw and run away - but I'm not going to with him - but I don't know what to do, either.
3	You are exceedingly ENFx, not INTP.
5	Can I ask — how old are you guys?\n\nI’m going to be really honest here and I hope this does not come off as harsh.\n\n**You’re kind of really overanalysing his actions...** Any potentially “yes” action seems to be making you really excited, and any potentially slightly “no” action seems to throw you into a complete spin. That’s what happens when we care about someone, right? I point this out because you might end up putting him on a pedestal and this will not end well for you.\n\n**The truth is, no one here can tell you what he feels unless you ask him yourself.** Not even with his MBTI Enneagram type etc. I mean, even this superficial reading of your thought process makes me think that most people wouldn’t remotely think that you’re an INTP/ Type 5 (not an insult or doubt on your type — just trying to make the point that we cannot tell from his type alone).\n\n**My suggestion/ conclusion...** I suspect that anyone who has read your post will conclude that you have romantic feelings for him. That seems quite clear and there’s nothing wrong with that, at all. It’s a beautiful thing. \n\nIf your question is “does it seem like he likes me or is he platonic?/ is he angry?/ how can I fix this?” I really cannot tell and don’t feel comfortable making assumptions based on someone I don’t even know. I behave the same way with both friends and partners — it’s not indicative of anything.\n\nAnyway, hope this wasn’t abrasive. I just don’t want you to be let down.

2	ENFJs and exes	Male ENFP here, i just wanted to share my story and see if i could get some feedback from you guys. So I've been madly in love this beautiful ENFJ girl for the past 3 and a half years of my life and i simply cannot get over her ( dated for like 2 years almost) on and off. I've been with tons of girls too before her, but I've never felt this sort of connection or intimacy with anyone else ever. \n\n Tbh, everything was perfect, literally. We were really good friends to begin with till i asked her out , she was always a really private person though and i always came on too intensely trying to 'figure her out' she absolutely hated that also physically we were pretty darn intimate but i was her first relationship and it was taking her time to get fully physical with me , so i somehow infered it as her not loving me enough or falling out of love with me.\nSo i got kinda cold with her too, we ended up breaking up , i just slept around with some other chicks, she got with 2 guys for a while as well after that , nothing significant really. \nBut then all of a sudden she came back to me again and left again soon after saying we were done for good this time. She'd said that before as well though while we were goin on and off ( she hates getting physical now with me, sees it as some form of self control or something )\n\nSo im stuck in a rut here, i absolutely love this girl and i dont want to hold her back or anything but is there even a slight chance that she'd change her mind ? We still meet from time to time cause we're still good friends. I need your help guys, how i do i deal with this without coming off as too needy/clingy? Cause I've already fked that part up trying to make amends for all the shit i did wrong the first time. I could wait an entire lifetime for this girl, trust me and she's well aware of how much she means to me as well
8	This sounds very toxic. Even if there’s a chance she’ll come back (I don’t know), you two would still do well with time apart.
8	who is your person?	Can You Name Your Person? Is It A Spouse, A Friend, A Family Member. What Makes Them Your Person?
14	I love this. My boyfriend is an INTJ and he is absolutely my person. He gets me, makes me laugh, challenges me, makes me feel sexy and cute, and I can be my absolute self around him. Nobody has seen how weird I can be except for him, but it’s ok because he’s definitely way weirder lol. 
3	I love this too. \n\nI think I have a different person for different aspects in my life, but the most important of them all is my boyfriend who is an INFP.\n\nEven though sometimes his doubts and cynicism get the best of him, it also helps me to be more critical and realistic in instances where I’d otherwise be too optimistic or hopeful.\n\nThere are also a few other people I go to depending on the situation:\n\nAn INTJ - when I want to talk about politics or other controversial topics, in which we’d have great debates and I can always count on us agreeing to disagree with no hard feelings\n\nAn ENFJ - she understands me like no one else can. She knows exactly why I feel a certain way about things even if no one else can agree. We both have very strong beliefs and values so I’m glad she understands how and why I feel the way I do about things. \n\nAn ENFP - she’s the greatest networker of all and gets along with everyone. I love how she’s so adaptable and I can learn a lot from her, especially about other people and how good she is at evaluating them. \n\nAn ISTJ - she’s the most loyal friend. There’s no one I know that can keep her word as well as this ISTJ. She’s reliable and will always do what she said she’s going to do. I may not be able to really talk to her about deep topics or issues, but I can always rely on her to be there when she says she’ll be.\n\nAn ISFP - she’s my voice of reason. She never discusses her problems, but she’s always there to help guide everyone else. She’s one of the most selfless people I know since she’s always thinking about others’ needs first while neglecting herself in the process. She may not have high self-esteem, but she thinks the world of other people and will help them any way she can, while being objective and impartial all at the same time. She’s like a counselor who will always be there to listen and help you through whatever you’re going through.\n\nAn ENTJ - very business-savvy and always has an answer or solution to any problems I may have with business. He may operate very different from me (I’m much more focused on the team and he’s more focused on the project), but we balance each other out when we discuss business. I’m always so impressed and amazed by this ENTJ with how he operates his business, and that in turn pushes me to work harder and smarter.
3	My most important person(s) are my two best friends, an INTP and ENTJ.\n\nINTP: The best listener. Very open-minded. He's really good at analyzing, understanding and rationalizing my emotions and perspective on things. Brings out the best in me and we have the most amazing debates and random talks about theories. Our thought process are very different but I think we get along really well because we share the same values. Also, best sense of humor and probably the smartest guy I've ever known.\n\nENTJ: The best listener as well. A social butterfly and very strategically smart. I thought she was an ENFJ when we first met but after getting to know her, she's more of an ENTJ with a well-developed Fe. She's constantly busy but always makes time for her friends. Amazing at finding logical solutions to both personal and work problems. I also love how she can be considerate and very honest at the same time. She's one of the people who always have my back along with the INTP.\n\nI'm going to stop here because I can go on and on about these two for too long xD
6	INFJ/ENFJ?	So i took 5 personalities tests that say I'm an enfj, but i took one recently that said I'm an infj anyone else had this cross connection between worlds?
7	I think the line between 'ENFJ/INFJ' is especially thin. Because 'feeling' 'judging' and 'intuitive' feel more interconnected to social spaces (to me anyway) then 'thinking' 'perceiving' and 'sensing'.  \n\n\nM-B is not a super definitive 'set' anyway. Your type may change over time,  recent traumatic experiences may have put you in a temporary 'I' mindset, etc. \n\nHumans (and our minds) are very complicated creatures. I recommend not seeing M-B analysis as deep level understanding, but rather a self-identified rough approximation about your most comfortable mental processing 'state'. \n\nYou are most comfortable in a NFJ state of being (processing things via/being sensitive to emotion, perceiving and judging all in one). This should not be taken as a limitation, simply your most comfortable state. You're likely either an ENFJ that's developed a healthy 'I' auxiliary processing (in my case, my close connection with my very 'I' brother lead me to be this way), or an INFJ who has developed a healthy 'E' auxiliary. It's largely moot. \n\nAccept that both your perception of yourself and how others perceive you will always be fundamentally flawed and limited/subject to change. Self-identify what feels 'right' in this moment, learn what you can, and shift your definition as your understanding continually improves with research, engagement with others about these ideas, and pursuing a 'variety of experience' mindset on life. Best of luck. 
2	I’m 52% ENFJ and 48% INFJ. 
2	Ah yeah! All the good people I'm really nice to think I'm an ENFJ, one old INTP refused to believe I was INFJ. I will note it doesn't matter as much to separate the two when both types share the same functions. Just prioritized differently, ya know? :) 
1	Same, just go take a look at both of them and see which part matches you best.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCareer wise I am more ENFJ, relationship wise I am definitely INFJ. 
12	Hi! I’m new!	Hey everyone! I’m fairly new at both Reddit and Myers Briggs. I just recently found out that I am a ENFJ. I’m currently going though a phase of self discovery because I’m just coming to an end of a stressful period of my life. I was hoping someone could tell me a little more about ENFJ. Also I’ve seen the term unhealthy ENFJ used a few times. What exactly is that? I’ve had friends who are extremely close to me tell me that I’m needy and always try and seek validation. Is this something that is “unhealthy” about ENFJ? Is there anything I could do to help better that aspect of my personality? 
11	First of all, a caveat: Humans and our minds are very complicated creatures. I recommend not seeing M-B analysis as deep level understanding, but rather a self-identified rough approximation about your most comfortable mental processing 'state'. You are most comfortable in a ENFJ state of being (processing things via/being sensitive to emotion, energized by positive social interactions, perceiving and judging all in one). This should not be taken as a limitation, simply your most comfortable state. \n\nIMO, an unhealthy ENFJ is one who sees their default processing 'state' as the entirety of their being, and lives at the beat of their default state drum instead of setting your own beat. If you look up developing auxiliary processing, there's a lot to be gained by forcing yourself into unfamiliar (and therefore less comfortable) mental processing. This is why meeting new people is so great for an ENFJ. Variety of experience is the name of the game. Meet new people, learn how they think, try it out for yourself (it won't feel 'right', but it will be good for you). Be alone for awhile. Have something to say to someone, and hold it back instead. Be confrontational when you'd normally be docile. Allow yourself to be uncomfortable so you can learn beyond the limits of your type.\n\n**Remove toxic people from your life**. Your nurturing natures will work against you, you will want to 'fix' them. But the only way to 'fix' toxic people is by cutting them out completely. All emotions that don't result in complete disconnect are addictive, especially for 'E' types, so if you allow hateful, resentful, or abusive energy to be directed at you, you'll be cultivating that energy in them as well as the negative emotional state it sets you in. You can get to a place where this feels 'normal', where you accept abuse daily, if you aren't careful. Basic process for successful disconnect:  \n1. Tell them what behavior is unacceptable and why. The closer to the moment the behavior is expressed, the better (once emotions are calm anyway, and it's better to handle on a case-by-case basis than let it add up and explode on them).  \n2. Listen to their apologies and excuses/rationalizations. Say you understand (being ENFJ, you will), but that does not mean you'll permiss the behavior long term. Say words are not relevant to whether you'll have to walk away, only actions matter.  \n3. When they don't change, move on.  \nToxic people are useful lessons. They are caught in bad patterns, and can show you what to avoid in your own processing. But long term they'll destroy you if you let them. \n\nI like to recommend the book 'Ask Powerful Questions: Create Conversations That Matter' as I think it has a lot of good advice for getting ENFJs where they want to be socially, but may not have the tools. Especially the section on the difference between empathy, sympathy, and apathy. ENFJs tend to default into unhelpful 'sympathy' places. If you learn to wield empathy instead you'll be cooking with fire and loved in the way you wish to be loved, for your ability and thirst toward understanding others.\n\nTherapy is always a good plan too, lots of lessons there. **Don't use your friends as therapists**. They will act like they want to help you deal with your anxious moments, and they will, but you need to accept ultimately this is always a burden. You can share in moderation, but it's that same 'emotions are addictive' problem. You'll burn out your friends and cultivate an 'injured child' mindset about yourself.
6	As an enfj I tend to be insecure about myself and always ask for validation as well as feeling comfortable knowing that everything will be ok. I don’t think it’s abnormal to feel this way at all, but I’m always seeking people to talk to and not be bottled up with my stress. It’s a lot easier knowing that you have a good support system. 
2	Ayy hi again!! :D
1	Any ENFJs who are in or studying business?	I recently left a medical program recently because it was very stressful and anxiety inducing and have started to pursue business. It was a very hard decision but I’m loving my classes thus far and am interested in doing marketing or management. \n\nI’d love to be either an HR manager or a healthcare administrator so I’m still able to help people but just at a different angle.\n\nAny other ENFJs here who have studied business in any way? What do you all think about ENFJs who work in business? I’ve noticed our persuasion and communication skills are very valuable in this field. Additionally it’s a good mix of independent work and collaboration depending on the career 
3	Former ENFJ here sort of found myself in the same situation during college. Was part of a medical program, did several medical internships and 150 hours of volunteering before realizing it was not for me. Felt pressured to do medicine and respected my parents wishes. I first changed my major to business and wish I stuck through with it because of the amount of opportunities. I didn’t know what types of jobs were out there frankly and it felt very new even though I was doing well in the classes. Ultimately changed to a pol sci related major and now working for the state department and very satisfied with my career direction. It’s important to know that there are many options out there when majoring in business. I know the ENFJ in me avoided doing hands on research on the types of tracks and career paths because I would be too overwhelmed. I think enfjs are well suited for careers with a business degree, but you must sit down and begin with some research on the types of entry level jobs and firms available in your area or where you’d like to work. You must network with your peers in the field especially those older than you. Trust me the job search becomes a lot easier when you’re getting a recommendation from someone already hired. This is the prime way to land an entry level job, and will reduce your time wasted unemployed after college. The one thing to remember is there are plenty of opportunities regardless of your major. Things will work out, do not fear. But do not waste time living in fear of your future or embassment of changing majors. You want to work HR? You do not need a business degree for that, at times your foot in the door will depend on who you know or meet. But that’s the beauty of a business degree, it can be very versatile. You can even work for the government with a business degree. It may even give you an edge for interviews because your of vocabulary and understanding of organizational behavior you’ve learned. Start cleaning up your dress style and become comfortable with a shirt and tie. Find clothes that fit. People do not realize this but success is half your hard work and the other half your image. You should try to look the part for the job you want. Start to imagine a career track, ex. I will apply for consulting jobs at Booz Allen and these other places. If I get a consulting job at these other places I will still apply for Booz Allen. Once at Booz Allen I will try to get promoted to senior consulatant. From then I will apply for Ernst & Young for this position, becoming mid level. I will now starting grad school and finish one year. Add to resume, apply for next job, etc. The goal is to never settle, always demand more of yourself and seek the highest benefit job you can find. ENFJs are perfectly suited for this. Wish you good luck! \n\nPs. Do not read this and go thanks for that info my research is now complete!!! Be sure to sit down and actually spend time on this. Also remember that you can apply for jobs at firms in college, talk to a friend in business and ask around. Make a LinkedIn. Start early! 
2	Me! I majored in HR :)
2	I do in business administration and organizational leadership.
10	Dealing with Loss of Relationships	One of my friends just moved away. Unfortunately, our friendship has been deteriorating in the past few months, due to the fact that she found a partner and re-prioritized to spending every waking moment with them. I feel as though they've been wearing rose-colored glasses, especially since the partner has exhibited controlling and possessive behavior in the past (and they recently had a huge fight).\n\n\nI'm pretty sure our friendship is over, as the dynamic hasn't been the same in a while. I've effectively lost my "person." Most importantly however, I'm the type of person who isn't so easily trusting, due to past naivety and getting hurt again and again by loved ones and people I once held dear. It's really thrown me for a loop, and I don't know how to deal with this. 
4	Sorry to hear that! Losing friendships is super painful. :-( For many people it's just as difficult as breaking up with a romantic partner. I wrote this article after a fall out with a very close friend, so it may be of help: [12 Strategies for Recovering from Losses and Break-ups](https://whitetigerwisdom.tumblr.com/post/175878593697/12-strategies-for-recovering-from-losses)
4	People come and go into your life.  Paths can converge and diverge at any time.  Nothing really lasts forever and people can change.  This situation happened to me years ago and I was deeply hurt by it as well.  I learned to just enjoy the moment I have with people and expect that things can change.  As time goes by, priorities and values change that take the people in your life on a different path from yours.  You can't control when this happens but you can change your mindset about it.\n\nIt is extremely natural for people to want to spend every waking moment with their significant other.  Especially if this is one of the first people they have fallen for.  I find that it is extremely rare for people who are in a relationship for the first time to know how to manage their time effectively.  I personally am also guilty of neglecting my friends during my first few relationships.  You can’t really control how other people treat you or what they should do, even if they are in a real bad situation.  I’ll break down what would be an optimal situation in my opinion.\n\n**Best thing you could have done from the beginning**  \n\n-	Be as supportive and happy for your friend as much as you can be.  \no	You may not agree with the situation that’s going on, but you can respect your friend if they feel happy in whatever situation they are in\no	If they are overall unhappy but choose to stay in that situation, you can’t really help or save them and it’s not really your responsibility to\n-	If you see something unhealthy happening, you can briefly express your opinion but don’t push on the topic if your friend isn’t receptive\no	People do not respond well to “being told what to do”.  Friends do push each other, but pushing too hard leads to loss in friendship\n-	Give them as much space as they need. \no	People in relationships tend to tunnel vision and it’s generally difficult to manage time while in one.  This is especially so for people who haven’t been in relationships before.\no	Nothing can be done to encourage them to spend time away from the other.  \n\nThis is all mostly ways to differentiate what you can vs can’t control.  Mostly because it is easier to accept things when you know it’s something beyond your control and you can’t really do anything about it. As long as you know you’ve done everything you could do and be ok with it, then it’s just easier to process everything.\n\n**What you can do now**\n\n-	Let your friend know that you’ll always be around if they want to talk or hang out.  Depending on how severely the friendship has deteriorated, you can let them know you’re supportive of their decisions and will be there for them when they need you.\no	People don’t realize how bad it is to neglect friends until after the fact they realize they don’t have any friends anymore to confide with.  When they realize this depends on several factors, but this typically happens after the a relationship ends.  \n-	Understand if you did everything you could to be a good friend to them, how they treat you isn’t a reflection of who you are as a person.  \n-	Friends do indeed drift apart and if your friend would rather drop you as a friend to pursue someone else, this reflects poorly on them as a person.  Despite whatever memories and experiences you both have shared in the past, this sort of friend is not great for you.  As in any ship, friendship or relationship, if needs and values are not met, then they aren’t worth it.\n-	If the friend is treating you poorly, they are risking losing your friendship not the other way around\nIt really sucks to lose people in your life, but this is something that will happen more than just once.  Just because you lose one friend though, doesn’t mean you can’t make another.  Life is full of wonderful surprises.  Losses can lead to gains and in general you’ll be ok in the future.  Feelings are also constantly changing so today it might suck, but the next day will pick up.\n\nI’d like to add a bit of perspective because right now we are only seeing your point of view of the situation.  You might perceive that your friend is focusing all her time and energy on her new significant other and this other is controlling/possessive.  Perhaps maybe you see them in this light because the friend always comes to you to vent about their problems/troubles. I personally know that from experience, when people are happy in relationships they don’t express what’s going on as much.  No news is good news.  When things are bad, then things are bad and people want to vent about it.  Relationships aren’t always a state of constant happiness, they take a tremendous amount of time/work/communication.  Like from your friend’s perspective, what if you are the one being difficult because of the change in allocation of time between you and their partner?  What if you aren’t being happy for them and are simply being jealous?  Maybe this is more along the lines of resentment of feeling like you’ve lost your friend to some new person in their life.\n\nObviously this is all speculation and I don’t know the entire story.  I just find that doing a lot of self reflection helps me feel better when I lose people in my life.  Asking stuff like:\n\n-	Was there anything I could do, did I do anything wrong\n-	Am I treating them well, are the treating me right\n-	Is my behavior acceptable, is their behavior acceptable\n-	Am I a good friend, are they a good friend\n-	Are they the sort of person I’d want to keep in my life?\n
6	Polyamory/Non-Monogamous Relationships?	I'm curious if anyone here is polyamorous/non-monogamous? Since we're super empathic and loving, I'm curious if that extends into romantic relationships as well? I've been questioning whether or not I am, myself. As someone with a lot of love to give, it makes total sense. 
4	its the future. \nwe are limited by our weaknesses and dogma.  \nnot long and it will be gone.  \n\npersonally i can say i have been, but at a distance / virtually. there arent that many people around that i managed to get high intimacy with 
1	I have done both before. However, it can be very very exhausting at times. Have you ever had two friends fight over your attention before? It's like that but with sex so it's waaaay more intense. If you have likeminded, secure, calm partners then it will be much smoother. 
10	Why does this bother me so much?	I’m an ENFJ female and I have a good guy friend (INTJ male) who I used to be really close to. Recently, we’ve been busy and haven’t seen much of each other in the last few years. He’s gotten engaged and I’m happy for him; it seems they are really happy even though I don’t know his fiancée too well since I’ve only seen her on a few occasions.\n\nI generally like catching up with people one-on-one, and even if I hang out with people in a group setting, I usually will try to find time to meet up with them separately so we can go into depth with our conversations. With this good guy friend, we haven’t had much time to do that in the last few years. \n\nThe last few times we were supposed to hang out, his girlfriend/fiancée would also show up. I was fine with that, but this time, my friend and I had discussed hanging out and just catching up with the two of us. Just before we are supposed to meet up today, he texts me and tells me his fiancée will also be coming.\n\nI told him that I thought it was just going to be the two of us. I don’t mind group settings, but I’d like for just the two of us to just catch up since it’s been so long. We didn’t end up meeting up, and I probably won’t see him for at least another half a year. \n\nI don’t know why this bothers me so much. I guess I usually don’t like it when plans change in general, and I know I’d prefer to meet with people one-on-one, but I guess it also feels like I don’t have the same friendship with this friend anymore as I once did. Maybe we’ll never hang out with just the two of us again, and that sort of changes the dynamic of our friendship. We used to be able to talk candidly about anything and everything but it hasn’t felt that way in a long while.\n\nIs this something that would bother you other ENFJ’s? Or am I the only one who would be bothered by this? 
9	It was inconsiderate of him, and that rubs your Fe the wrong way. I would have done this a few years back, but I wouldn't anymore ever since I learned about what Fe values.
8	I've found a lot of men won't have one-on-one friendships with women once they are in monogamous relationships, sad to say. :-( However, I've found most guys ditch their friendship with me altogether as soon as they find a partner, rather than even trying to meet up with me while including the spouse. For this reason I mostly focus on friendships with women or gay and ace/aro guys, because those friendships tend to last longer.
7	Oh my goodness this exact thing happened to me a few years back but with one of my girlfriends who had recently got in a relationship with a new guy. I had a boyfriend too but I would always think it was just us girls catching up. Then I would turn up and she wouldn’t even TELL me she was bringing her boyfriend, he would just be there!\n\nI. Feel. Your. Pain. 
3	I think you hit it on the head--your relationship with him will be less since he has his fiancee in his life (and she appears to be the jealous type). Nothing you can do about it, just an Fe mourning process for the loss of some intimacy. I'm guessing that the sudden change in plans is also frustrating, but probably not to the same degree.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome doors open, some doors shut, here's to close friendships that haven't happened yet, and intimate ones that have vanished. [https://youtu.be/uUK-8M3Vhzc](https://youtu.be/uUK-8M3Vhzc) 
3	left field theory just in case there's some truth to it:\n\ndo you have a crush on him and this is why you're bothered?\n\n
5	Understand that the dynamic of his life has changed, and he’s learning to adjust. While your priorities have remained solid, his have shifted dramatically. Be patient, and respect that he may not feel comfortable meeting one on one anymore.
3	I mean, I’m an ENFJ and I completely relate, but as a girl with a boyfriend I also know that after some point, when your relationship reaches a certain level of seriousness it’s almost inappropriate to have close personal coed friendships. Then again, I don’t know the nature of your friendship with the INTJ, but my guess would that it’s not the most inconsiderate thing in the world to invite his lady with him when catching up with another woman one on one, someone she may not know as well. I don’t think it’s about the fiancée being the “jealous type,” just about appropriate boundaries for a serious couple. That’s just my humble opinion. It’s not unrealistic.
2	Friendships age too, it seems. I've also been thinking about this recently, some really old bonds that I left on my own free will. It starts to become a little painful on the inside to realize things aren't what they once were, but they're still a reality we must dismantle or adhere to. Cheer up, OP! I just hope you aren't saddened by the fact of it happening. I also know what you mean by one on one preference, since it's kind of the same being an INFJ. A possible solution in the meantime is the opportunity to know the Fiance one on one, don't ya think? They're there afterall... Once people are engaged, they really start to change. I don't mean to be rash, but I have this sense you truly love that INTJ, not a bad thing! :) \n\nThough all in all, it would bother anyone, thank you for bringing it up... The most simple solution is to be blunt with the INTJ, to explain to him, he can't read what you feel, only certain counselors have that kind of ability. You could stay bothered of course, but the better option is to bring it up to save a bond. I hope for the best, OK! :D
2	since he's already woth his fiance, thats what you have to expect ( no offense haha).Of course his fiance would tag along since theyre already in an intimate relationship and i think thats okay as long your friendship status with him doesnt change. It really seems you are attached with this intj dude ,in a friendly way\n\nI think it would be best to expect that whenever you want to meet up with him, he will tag his fiance because like what i said, they are in an intimate relationship. Just let him be and im sure you will understand :)\n\nSimilar to your experience, one time, my enfj bff decided to invite me for lunch during internship. I let my intern friend tag along and invited her for the lunch. What my enfj friend didnt expect was that i would invite my intern friend to the lunch. I could see he was somewhat dissapointed since he had been bottling up his feelings and he wanted to communicate them to me.\n\nDont worry, you can spend time with other people other than him.
1	Totally understand what you mean then. Fulfilling friendships can sometimes be hard to come by. This feels like a violation of the friendship. That’s unfortunate. I know what it’s like to want one on one time with an old friend. Sounds like one or both of them might be a little jealous/codependent then. Good luck with your friend. ♥️
40	Does pleasuring your partner turn you on the most?	I'm wondering if this is something that all ENFJs have in common.\n\nWhen I'm intimate with my partner, what turns me on more than ANYTHING else is giving them pleasure. I.E. going down on them, hearing them moan, etc.\n\nCan anyone relate?\n\nUPDATE:\n\nHappy to see I'm not alone! :)\n\nI love being an ENFJ and really love this subreddit.
25	The sexiest possible image for me is knowing someone else is getting horny thinking about me. It’s much less about feeling sexy but knowing they get off on/because of me.
11	Fe in the lead. Our feelings are pretty much determined by the feelings of those we care about. At least in my experience. This can make us very selfless lovers ;) 
5	I am with you completely! My wife thinks I am crazy but it really gets me goin, lol.
3	A man dominating me and making lusty faces turns me on the most. I'm female though, so maybe it's different for your gender. Also, the current guy I'm with has me do most of the work- he likes receiving, which is now making me bored of sex.
2	I feel happy when I make others happy, so I definitely agree with this! Or at least I think I would if I had a partner to test it out on. I mean, sexual pleasure isn’t too different from nonsexual pleasure, right?\n\nOkay! Until I get a partner to test it out on, my hypothesis is that I WILL get pleasure from giving them pleasure. 
1	lol
18	Do you guys also feel like you don't find people like yourself?	
24	And going around day to day wishing you would come across someone with the same level of sincerity and comfortable openness? Yes.
8	I'm searching for other ENFJs in real life. \nAlthough that doesn't mean that a friendship will flourish, it's a great feeling.
4	I have been dating a fellow enfj recently and we are so similar it's scary. We have different interests of course but the way we see the world and approach situations (particularly emotionally) is almost carbon copy.\n\nI love it, but it's also very jarring. To know someone has the capacity and frequently over analyses the way I do can lead to a negative feedback loop. Our relationship is so rewarding, but our similarity has also almost led to our early demise.\n\nIt's been a lot to get used to after being with partners who don't share, don't analyse, and generally handle situations in a way that's opposite to myself.\n\nSo all of this is to say, it is amazing but it's also a challenge. There is no where to hide when the other person knows you so intimately because they basically are you. 
5	Lol. I am an INFP who was reading comments from other INFPs who were raving about how awesome you guys are. I come to this sub to kind of peek around and I was not disappointed. Stuff like this this-right in the feels! You guys rock, just saying.
2	#mylife
1	I have been struggling with this quite a lot recently. I know two other ENFJs: my father (who is entirely self-centered and doesn't listen at all) and a friend's mother who I got along with really well. Other than that, all of my friends are introverted and though they love me and give me their best, I often feel isolated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI compared myself to my friend's nervous mix-breed dog, always craving love but not always having that love reciprocated. I'd love to find others like myself.
1	I feel attacked by this relatable content. 
24	Do y'all like to read?	I am an ENFJ and I absolutely adore reading. I'll always be picking up books that are recommended to me and reading whenever I'm not talking with others or working. I never see reading mentioned here, so do none of y'all read, or do you just not talk about it?
8	I read voraciously.
6	Enfj here, i’m not really into reading. It’s hard for me to get attached to a book. I have a short attention span and tends to talk rather than read specially when i’m surrounded with people. 
4	I think no one ever talks about it, because reading tends to be associated with introverted tendencies. Or most likely they ever bring up books when asked about it. :)
4	ENFJ here. Love reading.  Have a goal to read over 100 books a year and usually it. \nThen, I love sharing my favorites with others. \n\nI admit to having some introverted tendencies though. 
3	I love reading! I often struggle with finding time to do "alone" activities because I am so busy with work/social life, but it's my preferred way to settle down after a long day is done.
3	Yes, definitely. I find that it's always an interesting point of conversation in meeting new people. For me, it's sort of a parallel between being an ENFJ and simply loving to learn about people, but through literature you can also do that. Hear and feel people's stories. 
2	I love reading... I’m also “33%” introverted ha
2	I love reading! My favorites are typically first person novels or memoirs (anything that feels like I’m listening to a person in real life) as it satiates my extroverted feeling function.
2	I have a system where I get to cover various genres. \nI do love my fiction time though. 
2	I adore reading! It transports me away from reality. Shame I don’t get the time though.
2	I love reading, mostly fiction works. I’m super into modern fantasy at the moment but also enjoy a lot of horror and science fiction.\n\nI don’t really talk about it much, to be honest. It’s more of something I quietly enjoy by myself? But every now and then I’ll get obsessed with a universe and then I can’t stop sharing it. In the respect, my current drug of choice is CJ Bernstein’s MAGIQverse.
1	Have always loved reading! I try to read one book per month now that I'm done with h formal schooling. 
1	Yes. I think I probably go through more books per year than anyone else I know lol, especially now that we have audible and audiobooks. I'd estimate I read 100-150 books per year.
1	I’m slowly starting to get back into reading. I enjoy self growth books and using practical skills. I also enjoy abstract stories and poetry. Right now I’m reading “Give and Take” by Adam Grant which is about why helping people drives our success. Very ENFJ, I know :)
1	I love reading! I used to hate it growing up but now I'm more accepting of it. I think it has to do with instant gratification growing up. I read a mix of books now. It ranges from business, self help, fiction, medical, humor, biographies etc. \n\nWork related books \n - Principles by Ray Dalio\n - 90 Days\n - Leaders Eat Last\n - Tools of Titans\n\nSelf Help\n - The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*CK\n - The Magic Art of Tidying Up\n - Start with Why\n\nNon-fiction\n - When Breath Becomes Air\n - Moonwalking with Einstein\n - The Birth of the Pill\n - Do No Harm\n - Gut\n - Thank You for Being Late\n
8	Does anyone else struggle with ambivalence?	Time and time again, in relationships especially, I struggle with simultaneously feeling one way as well as the opposite. Sometimes I attribute this to the Fe-Ni power to see multiple sides of others’ perspectives. But when they’re contained within myself, it just feels like a raging and ambiguous internal battle with no resolution insight. I become incredibly restless. Any advice?
3	[deleted]
2	Could you give me an example?
3	Can someone fool our FeNi by changing their own intentions?	I had a close friend (ESTJ) that I provided a lot of support for, both emotionally and financially, often to my own emotional detriment. We had a falling out several months ago, and it has been extremely difficult for me to walk away from the situation. \n\nOther friends have told me that she was manipulating me and is still trying to do so. However, I've always found it difficult to believe that, because she always seemed so genuine to me.\n\nThough she is a kind person, she has extremely low empathic sense and has faced a lot of difficulties in life. I've always used those two factors to explain away her behavior. \n\nBut recently, I began to wonder if she had changed her own intentions to better act like she had my best interests at heart. It's the ultimate salesman technique: to convince yourself that you're doing what's best for the customer. She is intellectually capable of it, and has demonstrated manipulative behavior with other people. But I always trusted her, because I am usually such a great judge of intention and she didn't raise any of my red flags.\n\nThis is really beginning to freak me out, as it would explain a lot of our history. Has anyone had a similar experience??\n\n
5	ExTJs do tend to be opportunistic and take advantage of people if hey see something playing in their favor. But you gotta look out for number one... if interacting with them has caused your own emotional and mental health detriment, it doesn’t matter what their intentions were, do what’s good for you.
2	I have definitely experienced very mind bending manipulation from STJs before and I think they are so unaware of their own emotional life that they can come across innocent and as if they’re acting for the sake of duty/the rules/rightness. They scorn compassion in others as weakness.  They’re very good people at times who keep society following tried and tested methods and values, but when emotionally scarred, they can manipulate.  I think the best test of a person is what happens when you don’t do what they ask. Then you see the real colours come out, and you see if any of their affection for you was for your sake or just to achieve their own ends. 
71	Me whenever I see a post that starts out by detailing how much the OP appreciates ENFJs	
15	We are pretty great, I know
26	The golden retriever of humans 
6	But I don't like myself....
4	This is NOT how you use this meme image, ENFJs.
3	lol its nice to be appreciated
3	Best careers/friends/vacations for ENFJs?	
5	I’m an enfj and I work in operational finance in healthcare. I work closely with physicians, nurses, and patients. I love it!  I get to make a difference and I work on lots of spreadsheets too!
3	######Careers\n\nAny kind of assistant or secretary, nurse, therapist, psychologist, biologist, babysitter, pet sitter, server, working with animals.\n\nMany become lawyers or salespeople, but I can't recommend these as I hate them.\n\nPositions that act as intermediaries.\n\nWell-developed ENFs are good at leading-from-behind positions.\n\nTeachers are already pretty good as far as work-life balance goes.\n\nFor work-life balance, consider moving to Europe or Canada. America is not your friend.\n\n######Friends\n\nENF (best), other Feelers, IST. Avoid ESTs for your own sake.\n\n######Vacations\n\nJapan and India have very ENF cultures so would probably be interesting to visit.\n\nLiving in a big city and visiting local attractions.\n\nI prefer sightseeing to relaxation. For relaxation I would probably just stay at home.
1	Hey!\n\nI know the 3 things I posted are so random but I’m studying next year and would like a career change that gives me more work life balance (have previously been a teacher). \nBest friends are which combos for ENFJ?\nAnd finally, what kind of places and activities for an ENFJ vacation?\n\nThanks xx
1	Ooh good question! I’m like a magpie, I love sparkly things (jewellery haha). If someone surprised me with jewellery I would probably cry. Or just something thoughtful they thought I would like. I’m not into practical gifts, they annoy me ha. 
1	Yeah that would definitely be my worst nightmare. I find it hard to keep a Pokerface when I see things like that. \n\nHow do you deal with it?
1	Hello, I'm an INFJ looking for friends. AMA :)	
2	Will you be my friend? :D
1	I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n- [/r/amaaggregator] [Hello, I'm an INFJ looking for friends.

1	Eyyy man ENFJ here. Where are you from bro?
19	Can r/enfj have a chat room?	Reddit now has chat rooms! Other MBTI subs already have them. \n\nhttps://s.reddit.com/channel/1296761_fcab9a649c68ffa7abb6c9b7f79efe027e6f0510\n\nhttps://s.reddit.com/channel/341899_9129ba0fb42b8ef5711e8bb39fccf901fe9bf58e\n\nCan ENFJs have a chat too? Thanks :)
8	I second this.
4	Where is the chatroom, I need it in my life
3	I been thinkin this!
3	Yeah we DO need a chat of our own! I'd love to be around people who understand me without having to try so hard. 
1	**WOOOO, ENFJ PARTAY! :D**
144	Do other ENFJs feel like a "lonely extrovert"?	I randomly used the "lonely extrovert" term to describe myself the other day to a friend. Like I love being surrounded by people and getting to know them in a deep way. But there are moments where I realize I don't have a real connection with that many people actually and my true circle of friends is pretty small. Which makes me sad because I want to be surrounded by more people and love them all, but for all sorts of reasons as an adult it's hard to maintain a deep loving friendship with many people--and idk it makes me a little sad and lonely tbh. \nAnyone else relate or have any tips? 
28	I can relate. I recently realized that I have at least 5 people who have described me as their best friend, and one or two who I would say I confide in. It is difficult to not really be “known,” but I realize that some of that is in my control.  I’ve made a conscious effort to be more open, but it takes intentional work. 
20	Isn’t this like a typical ENFJ thing? And yes, I feel the same. For me it has to do with getting a bit too emotionally overwhelmed with close relationships so I tend to keep them on a distance. I just care and love so much and deeply. It’s not until recently I’ve actually tried to look past that and invest more time in my friends, and it’s been hard.. but I’m making progress :) 
15	Yep. \n\nFor me, it's a tension between wanting to foster a deep connection with everyone I meet, but only having the emotional energy to really sustain that for a small group of people. \n\nAlso, despite getting along with nearly everyone I meet, I sometimes don't *click* with that many people, which makes me sad. Lately I even asked one of my close friends to tell me, honestly, how I might be an annoying person, because I was trying to figure out if I'm accidentally driving people away. She assured me I'm not annoying, but maybe she's biased? :) \n\nAs a remedy, I try to feel secure in the friendships I do have and remind myself that these lonely feelings are probably common for everyone, and mostly in my head. \n\nI also accept that, like with romantic relationships, sometimes the timing's just bad. I've met really cool people before and thought "We could be friends!" but then I acknowledged how busy I was, how far away they lived, how I already had my hands full with current connections, etc., and realized it wasn't going to happen. Nothing personal. I'm sure that happens more than people realize, and yet we take it personally. \n\n
13	I relate very much, and that’s a great way to describe it. I’m “friends” with everyone, but good friends with few people.
11	I'm an ISTP and that sounds so backwards to me, so it makes sense that's how ENFJ would feel.\n\nI have very few friends but I share a connection with all of them. I get rid of friends that I have no connection with. I would say I am a "non-lonely introvert." Most, if not all my friends are introverted as well.\n\nIf you want a deeper connection with your friends, spend quality time with them. Sacrifice the enjoyment you get from groups of people, to forge a deeper connection with one person at a time.
7	I never considered myself as an introvert yet i can't openly say I'm extrovert as i don't have many friends(5 close friends) \nThen i thought i maybe an ambivert\n\nBut now that you've came up with a new word\nI think I'm am so called "lonely extrovert"......what a shitty irony isn't it?\n\n
6	Also relate. I have a really good affinity for making friends, but I only have one person who I feel like I can honestly speak to heart to heart with. It's also held me back from making long-term commitments or going for relationships. I'm just glad I'm not alone in this
5	I can relate
4	The same here
4	Yup
5	Absolutely.
5	I feel the exact same, but I’m an introvert (Who loves people to death).\n\nBUT a solution!!! There’s a book called The Art of Loving by Erich Fromm, in which he talks about men relating and communicating core to core. And That any other sort of connection fades compared to Core to core. To build that sort of real bond you have to get rid of all differences and connect at the most “basic” shared ideals. (As well as “trivial” things.) \n\nI’m trying to find the exact passage. 
4	I feel lonely every day. Part of the problem is that I am naturally drawn to introverts because of their difference in energy, yet because they get exhausted easily.. I barely get to spend time with them. And the extroverts in my life tend to make me very exhausted (I'm close to ambivert but slightly more extroverted). So I tend to be alone a lot. The struggle is real. 
4	I definitely relate to this. I always go out of my way to listen and help others but when the time comes nothing is reciprocated and I’m just, at times, awkwardly left hanging. This always makes makes me feel like a “lonely extrovert” because I alway want to be around others but I almost feel used in different situations and like no one actually knows who I am. 
3	Yes ;_;
2	I'd be happy with a few good friends.
2	YES
2	I'm coming to the conclusion that this is the eternal struggle of the ENFJ (if and when there is a struggle). This happens because we're using our inferior Ti (introverted thinking) function for things that are firmly Fe (extroverted feeling, our primary function). Things that are Fe cannot be measured, so when we apply Ti, we start getting sad, because there will always be some objective measure that we fail socially by. TBH, the solution is probably to develop your internal world of Ni (introverted intuition, secondary function) in order to achieve satisfaction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore details on my theory [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/enfj/comments/9cbh2q/teenage_enfj_give_me_some_advice/e5bx6zw/) as well as proposed solutions
1	I could easily sit in a room full of my closest friends & basically remain as a fly on the wall. With my family I'm the same. I don't always feel the need to chime in on conversation, sometimes I'm even tuned out which I try not to do but it's the general vibe of the room. It's like a room full of happy feelings from the people I care about. It's not that I don't care what they're saying, I do. I want to be involved in their lives but sometimes I get swept away by the feeling of happy energy & can drift off into la la land. My mom jokes saying I live in my own little world sometimes but it's true & I wish I didn't. I just want to enjoy the moments I have with the ones I love, I'm just enjoying them in a different way. 
1	i'm just like this and many of the commenters in this thread... i suppose that i almost never feel as understood as i do just reading about other enfj's describe themselves. thanks fellow enfj's :)
2	MBTI & Music Survey (Redesign) - Need respondents!	 I created an initial version of this survey a few days ago, but after receiving feedback and reviewing many of the responses, I restructured it to increase accuracy, depth, and easier data analysis. Even if you've already taken the previously posted survey, please take this new one as well.\n\nThis is a survey searching for correlation between MBTI and musical interests such as genres, instruments, singing, dance, and composition/production. Once I get a descent amount of responses, I will post the results in [r/mbti](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti) (unless [r/enfj](https://www.reddit.com/r/estj) would like me to post them here as well). I've created individual surveys for each of the 16 personality types, and the one below is SPECIFICALLY for ENFJs.\n\nThe ENFJ survey link:\n\n[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JTVZFQC](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JTVZFQC) \n\n​\n\nIf you are not an ENFJ please find the correct link for your type here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9a6hbw/mbti\_music\_survey\_redesign\_need\_respondents/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9a6hbw/mbti_music_survey_redesign_need_respondents/)\n\n​\n\nThanks for your responses! As I said previously, I will post the results and analysis in [r/mbti](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti) once the survey is completed.
3	I know this isn’t the right place, but I don’t know who to turn to and y’all might relate. Should I feel guilty for breaking up with someone because they’re transgender?	First, I’m ENFJ, Christian, 20, and heterosexual, but also feel like everyone needs to live their own lives. So no disrespect for transgenders.\n\nWe’ve only been out a couple of times and I didn’t know until he told me in bed last night (we slept together but didn’t do the thing)\n\nI feel really guilty because I have no idea what to say next, but he says he might transition and I know I can’t be romantically with him for that.\n\n\nMost of all I’m just really freaking out because I don’t even know who to turn to for advice. Any words on what to do or how to calm down are needed.
7	No
4	You shouldn't feel bad for breaking up with people for any reason, if that reason leads you to not wanting to be with them. Being trans is a huge situation. It's not like you want to break up because they leave the toilet seat up too much or something, but even then, if that was something that REALLY bothered you and they didn't change, you would have every right to break up with them. There aren't set rules for dating, except being honest and open. If you aren't happy and the situation can not be fixed, get out of the relationship. Life is too short to stay unhappy in a relationship because you think other people might judge you.
4	I think its better for the both of you that you ended things now, rather than not feeling confident in the relationship and ultimately wasting each others time. You are treating them and yourself with respect. 
2	theres more to it than just being transgender\n\ntell me, was your transgender SO rude? inconsiderate or what?\n\ni just want to clarify things
3	ENFJ without a physical support system	Hey guys--hope you're all having a good day! I'm reaching out because I've found myself in a situation where I've started to feel like I don't have a strong physical network of people where I live. My partner is long distance (a flight away), but thankfully my family and best friends are a bus ride away (3-4 hours) and I now visit them often. I'm in a grueling professional degree program where my classmates are busy with their own lives and work and relationships. I find myself feeling surprisingly alone. I'm a woman, and I have very very few close female friends. My few close male friends toe the line of inappropriate flirtation and it makes me uncomfortable because I feel that it's disrespectful to me and my partner, but I don't want to be rude and presumptuous about it and I don't want to lose the few close relationships I have. \n\nI've noticed that most of my peers don't need others. They don't need to bounce ideas off of people or work with others so they don't spiral into self-destructive tendencies. I severely dislike how I need people and I wish I could become more independent. Any advice on ways to look within and eliminate how much I need people? \n\nThanks, friends <3
5	I can relate. isolation is crippling to an ENFJ.
3	Istp here. Sleep w me and I will teach you the sage arts of being alone.
2	Hey there!!\nFirstly, since I'm ENFJ just like you i can relate to you and understand your perspective but maybe i can help you \nBut could you answer my question?\n\nDo you consider yourself as a"lonely extrovert" or are you an introvert? \n\n
2	accept the fact that you wont see much of your friends  and your SO because they are all busy with their lives and so are you. \n\nIt really doesnt matter if you dont see them much. What really matters is that, even though you dont see them that much,they still consider you a part of their life like true friends should do\n\nyou can try new activities or go out on your own and drink coffee to unwind\n
1	ENFJ here who also posted a similar thread this morning about being a lonely extrovert! I can sort of relate about not having a physical support system or even an immediate one because all of my close family and friends are scattered far away and would take at least an hour to come to me if I had an emergency. I still haven't figured it out yet when it comes to managing on my own with a remote form of emotional support but I will say it helps with knowing who your close family and friends are, and maintaining that connection and regularly keeping in touch with them in some ways. Me and my parents regularly text each other on a group chat and I have a few friends I send a daily goofy Snapchat or Facebook meme to basically say hi. It also helps knowing they do have your back even if it doesn't seem like it. I constantly have to remind myself I do have people that care about me and I have texts and other words of affirmations saved to remind me of that gem. Idk how much this has helped but feel free to respond and maybe we can strategize something together! 
1	Totally understand! Except for the partner bit (single mum) I’ve basically got the exact same situation as you. I had to go to the doctor this morning and took mum with me because I wanted someone to come shopping with me after and the doctor asked if I had any friends to call on in an emergency as my parents are off to Europe in 3 weeks. \n\nMe and mum laughed and were like um no actually, no friends here.\n\nThe problem is that I’ve lived in my current city for less than a year and most of that time I’ve either been pregnant, extremely sick, or my baby has been too grumpy when I try and take him to baby classes. \n\nSo I really really really get where you’re coming from. I miss my friends from my old city and I feel so lonely here. 
2	Is this typical ENFJ behaviour?	Female intj here. I have a very close female friend who is an enfj. We get along well most of the time but some of the things she does annoy the hell out of me.\n\nAn example(this happened about a month ago): we were talking to two guys which we had just met; my friend and I were sitting next to each other on the floor and the two guys were opposite of us sitting on a bed. At one point she decided to stand up and talk to them while standing which is fine but her back was facing me the whole time and she was a foot in front of me. I find that offensive since it felt like her way of saying 'I'm the centre of attention and I should be the only one talking to these people' \n\nThis has happened many times before even with people we've know for a long time. It's probably something she does unconsciously but should I talk to her about it?
4	Hey there!\nShe's your best friend duhh!!\nWhat are you afraid of?\nThe fact you talking what you feel to her might effect your relationship that's it?\nYou shouldn't since that would suggest she isn't your "close friend"\n\nI believe that a sensible conversation could solve every misunderstandings \nSo\n\nMore Power to you!!!
4	Just have a very rational discussion with her about it. I know I would appreciate the rational straight forwardness (that I know intjs usually have) of a friend discussing something with me that bothered them versus bottling it up and never talking about. I almost guarantee she doesn't realize she's doing it and definitely is not doing it to be the center of attention. ENFJs really truly care about how others are feeling.
3	(random knowledge from body language books I've read/ENFJ research):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis particular situation is clearly, from a body-language perspective, someone impeding the interactions between two groups (one group = the two guys, second group = you). Being that your friend is an ENFJ, there are probably a few different possibilities:\n\n1. Your friend senses unsavory motives from the two guys (it's possible she could be picking up cues that you aren't) and is consciously or unconsciously trying to protect you, her important friend.\n2. Your friend is an unhealthy ENFJ and wants to be the center of attention.\n3. Your friend is testing the two guys for worthiness to talk with you. Or some other form of protection.\n\nYou might try asking your friend why they are doing the behavior. It strikes me as either protection or attention-seeking. Just my thoughts. Let me know if that helps. thx.
2	(Enfj with an intj best friend)\n\nI don't know your friend however if my best friend told me calmly and honestly that she wishes I wouldn't do that I would feel really bad for doing it and would make sure I am absolutely mindful to include her and not overshadow her anymore.\n\nIf you're anything like my friend then I imagine you'd be quite calm and rational about it. ENFJ's like myself respond badly to constructive criticism when people antagonise us but just letting us know in a friendly way should do the job. :)
2	As an ENFJ I can probably say she wasn’t even thinking about it when she stood up and got closer to speak to them. I don’t know your friend, but ENFJs are compassionate and intimate personalities. Whether she “wanted the attention” or not, her intention was more likely to make the people she was speaking to feel like she was giving them HER attention. Just tell her you felt overshadowed. If I were her I would feel super guilty for not only making a thoughtless decision that hurt my friend’s feelings, but also for portraying myself as someone that might want attention. I would hate to look that way. 
15	Has this ever happened to you guys?	I was thinking on how sometimes I'll misread someone. It's extremely rare I should add, because I'm generally pretty good at reading body language and tone of voice. But sometimes I'll encounter someone who's every part of their being is like, *screaming* that they don't like me. And you know, it'll be someone who you have to deal with daily, a colleague,  teacher, coworker, boss... and one day when you aren't expecting it, ***wham*** you hear from the person themselves that they really like you! And they just shower you with praise that you can totally tell is genuine, and you're just absolutely floored by it because like, "Where the hell did *that* come from???"\n\nI'm wondering if this is an ENFJ thing or an Fe thing in general. This has only happened a handful of times in my life. I just got a shower of praises from someone who I honestly thought hated me and I feel guilty for assuming that they disliked me off the bat tbh. 
3	I often assume someone doesn’t like me when they are having a bad day, social anxieties or are very direct or to the point. A lot of the time I have to consciously remind myself that it’s not always about me and that if it was they should have the guts to tell me what’s upsetting them! It’s can be quite stressful constantly wondering what I’ve done to offend someone and how to change. It’s quite nice when moments like yours happen. It’s like a lovely wake up call. 
2	happens to me all the time. most especially when it comes to superiors. with my line of work (i work in film) there's a lot of stress that comes with the job, and i just do my best every day. i try not to take things personally as i just tend to think that when someone talks to me harshly, it's just because they're stressed or not having a good day. *and then* all of a sudden, at the end of production, apparently i did a good job all along and they want to work with me again. \n\njust never assume. it's always a good thing to know that, in the end, you've impacted someone in a good way.
1	Hey!\n\nI think when you like or love a person you tend to act very weird and not "yourself" around them\n\nThis maybe because you get anxious or nervous when they appear infront of you and that's quite common to be honest \n\nIt's almost like you're going for your first interview\n\nHope that helped!!\n
1	Is it possible that you are just misreading people who aren't very expressive? Like low fi users?
7	ENFJ Programmers/Developers	Hi,\n\nI am an ENFJ I've been studying javascript for about 4 months now, and sometimes I just feel like this is not meant for me because reading documentation can be extremely difficult...\nDo you ENFJ developers have any advice or practices on focussing  and studying?
8	I asked this question some time back because I suffered with the same problem\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/enfj/comments/8yyxcf/advice_on_staying_focused/?st=JL031OS3&sh=c17671ef\n\nLast week, I decided to leave a great medical program because it simply wasn’t for me. It took me over 2 years to realize that after putting in all the work but I am so happy now. I realized that all that time, I was forcing myself to enjoy the material and told myself that soon enough, things would click and we would get to the interesting things. That just never happened and every single day was a struggle. I’d spend 8 hours of class, study for over 10 hours, get no sleep, have exams constantly, and feel anxious each day. It was not worth it.\n\nI cared too much about what people thought and most importantly, didn’t want to disappoint all my friends and family. It was really really hard but I am now pursuing a career in business, most likely a concentration in management! I am looking forward to a career where I can capitalize on my strengths and socialize with those around me :)\n\n
6	My ENFJ project manager (huge, many years, 40 devs, several countries) was a great programmer before she transitioned into PM. Fantastic PM, her experience helps tremendously.\n\nAh sorry, not advice. Just motivation. ☺️
3	I would pick up something more tangible at first like Game Development that's more visual, social, and fun. Work towards helping people with your studies if you are making websites or any kind of app. Connect with people in meetups using meetup.com. Try Node.js with react/redux etc if you want to focus in JS. Give it a try. Also read textbooks, medium articles, etc. The best way to learn is to know the concepts and logic before diving into the code. Sites like VisualGo, Sololearn, CodingBat, etc. can help too!
3	Reading documentation sucks for anyone.  Also, just because you’re Extrovert doesn’t mean you can’t become an anti social nerd lol.  Actually there’s a high demand for developers who have a sense of communication.  You just have to learn to develop the cognitive skills required, ie Ti/Te.  
3	Little late to the party, but wanted to chime in. I'm a dev, and documentation is just not fun to read. I usually look for docs that have A LOT of examples - looking at examples, and seeing how someone else may have done something is always a lot easier for me. I personally also find going back and forth is very helpful - i.e. looking at documentation just enough to understand what it's going through, and then implementing that and seeing how it works. Then once whatever it is works, I usually like to try and explain it to someone (Or even just try to explain it again to myself). It feels like it takes much longer, but its how I get through it. 
22	Overthinking with ENFJ's?	Hello r/enfj,\n\nHow often do you guys find yourself ruminating or finding yourself worrying about things that are not of your current priority?\nI always catch myself thinking about the worst worries or insecurities in my life while I am trying to study or get something done.\nI know this question may be unmeasurable due to its generalizing nature, but I want to know that I'm "OKAY" or I'm not the only one(Also another thing I worry about often, being or thinking different lol).\n\n\nLooking for support! \n\nThank you all!
8	You’re no alone. I [F] am an enfj as well and I find it normal to overthink a lot of things especially about the future, something that has been bothering/worrying me, or something small like if my outfit looks alright. I tend to care a lot about what other people think about my image and perception so I can’t help feeling unsecured especially during the time when I need to get stuff done cause my mind just ends up wondering. 
5	You're definitely not alone in that.\n\nOverthinking and worrying about stuff tends to be a fairly consistent thing for me. It definitely gets annoying and honestly kinda tiring. \n\nAlthough, from a different perspective, I think it can be nice. I don't mind taking some extra time to think through what I'm saying or doing, comes in handy. I definitely don't mind worrying about things if it means that I pay better attention to the people around me.\n\nIt's all about moderation and being able to maybe find a way to aim something that would normally be an inconvenience and instead make it something helpful.
4	Yup. It’s my go to behavior. It’s taken a long time to recognize its advantages (assess situations on a deeper level, critically assess the values/actions of myself and others) and an even longer time to work through the “spiral effect” that comes with overthinking. I’ve found that occupying my mind or body (working out, reading, chatting with friends) keeps those thoughts at bay and when I can’t do those things I try and shift my thought process by talking myself out of those thoughts (what’s cause me to overthink? What’s the core issue? What tangible thing can I do about it now?). It’s really helped me find better peace of mind in recent years. 
3	True
3	I've been overthinking things all my life. I'm doing my best taking a step back and not worry so much about things - and I've gotten better at - but it's still there, in the back of my mind.\n\nIt can be a good thing at times; I'm usually very perceptive, and the overthinking contributes to that. But I'd rather be more care free to be honest!
3	Fuck, I overthink almost everything. It's horrible in most cases, but I have no idea how to stop.
1	I find myself agonizing over pretty much anything that isn't an everyday normal occurrence. It honestly pisses off the people closest to me to no end, and I try to keep it to myself but then the anxiety of bottling it up drives me even crazier. You're definitely not alone. 
1	I worry far too easily & sometimes too much. I find that "mind over matter" almost like a meditative way of thinking & calming yourself helps. Or if you're really wound up & going crazy over something evaluate what steps you can make at that moment to make yourself feel better. That way at a later point in time when you address the problem you'll have already done a little bit towards solving the issue. 
36	y'all are the best type	Seriously. ENFJ's are amazing people that are amazing and always find a way to make my day. \n\nThank you. \n\n(Coming from an INFP if anyone's wondering)
32	Only 1 comment? Fine, I'll praise y'all\n\nI want every ENFJ to be happy because that's just what they want for everyone else, so it's only fair, right? \n\nI'm inspired by you guys if not a little intimidated by the magnetism and warm charisma you carry yourselves with.\n\nSelfishly wishing every ENFJ would adopt me so I can be the best version of myself for both me and you.
22	Of course it’s coming for an infp, damn you guys so thirsty for enfjs, I love it. \n\nY’all cute together 
8	That’s sweet but anyone can be amazing!! Have a great day!
3	awww thanks! we love everyone!! 💜🧡💜
3	Awww thank you so much!!! That's so sweet! :D you are all amazing, too! :')
2	**GROUP HUG** :D
16	Are ENFJs doomed to low paying jobs?	I love that I've found my way as an ENFJ and now that I've discovered career paths that I resonate with I still want them to be rewarding in the long run. Ability to pay off debt, buy a house, raise a family, travel, etc. 
11	No, not at all. I’m in HR and make a great salary. I was able to work overseas with it too as an expat and made an insane salary for years. It’s an interesting job because I’m dealing with people and allows me to be creative and use skills that are very ENFJ.  \n\nLooking back though I do think that becoming a therapist would have been an even better fit and therapists can make good money.
9	I just left an accelerated medical program because I was struggling and realized it wasn’t for me. I enjoy helping people but I wasn’t true to myself when it came to doing things my way and I was too fixated on a “prestigious” career.\n\nI’m in the process of choosing a new major and now want to focus on my strengths and on a new angle of helping people rather than restricting myself like I did before. I am looking into management or marketing because I think my social skills and creativity would work well in those fields. \n\nI’ve read that ENFJs struggle finding purpose in careers. I know I do but I think it’s about finding the balance of doing something fulfilling while also being social and working towards our individual strengths 
9	I'd think ENFJs after ENTJs will somehow come across a universal position to gain affluent status. :)
6	This is a good question and there is definitely some truth to this. The career paths where ENFJs would most like to see themselves would be to help others in some way. Teaching, counseling, psychology, music, art, customer service, first responders, program assistant or specialist, non-profit, foreign service officer, Human Resources, IT management are a few jobs an ENFJ would do very well in. These are not the most lucrative careers but could provide a decent income. ENFJs would like to avoid repetitive and or monotonous or technical style jobs. The problem for them is that they have big often conflicting goals but struggle to reach them. I find that they typically begin to figure things out career wise is in their late 20s. Before then they struggle to figure out what they’d like to do with their life and are preoccupied with the abstract like the meaning of life and the deeper meaning of things. This can be said of a lot many FeNi types. This coupled with an inferior Ti could be quite a challenge to get into any technical field, like engineering, information technology, law, medicine, finance, economics, careers in business, etc. Imagine if that N was replaced with an S, or that F replaced by a T. Suddenly many career paths open up, many of them which are quite lucrative. \n\nThat isn’t to say ENFJs can’t get into these fields, it’s simply a challenge. It can be done with enough drive and/or in someone’s care and guidance. 
6	I’m a server and I make about 70 grand a year plus benefits, which includes a 401k, HSA, and AFLAK. I love my job. People ask me what I want to do next and I say retire. I have enough time and money to do most anything I want in life. There is also upward mobility. I love food and wine and know a ton about it. I love facilitating people’s dining experience. 
5	i'm an engineer, pays pretty well and i'm fairly happy.  xD
4	I got a job in Marketing and make a nice salary. Initially, I got my degree in Liberal Studies/Humanities (don't do that) but went on to get my M.S. in Marketing and here we are!
5	Maybe I'm less of a typical ENFJ than most, but I've found plenty of satisfaction in my STEM career. I get my "helping & connecting with people" kicks by mentoring and supporting my friends. My interpersonal skills come in really useful when working with other STEM folks who are more introverted.
2	I’m on the compensation side myself and love it. I’m not naturally good with numbers but I am really good at seeing patterns in data and being able to present it in a way that speaks to my audience. I’ve learned to work with data in ways that are non-standard (I have some dyslexia too) which really enhances my value.\n\nStaffing could be really interesting and if it speaks to you then go for it. It’s not my cup of tea but that’s more history than anything probably.\n\nEdit - was supposed to be a reply to my initial thread.
2	I'm a clinical pharmacist. I enjoy talking to (most) patients about their meds. They really sounds delighted when they talk to me compared to my coworkers
2	I don't have a degree & work as an administrative assistant. It's kind of perfect for me (organized, regular hours, structured work days, etc) but some days are tough because I get creative spurts that I don't know what to do with. I've tried to start up photography on the side but it hasn't really taken off. I also started writing what I hoped would become a book but somehow I struggle with both. It's weird & uncomfortable to not know exactly what you're great at. None of these things will make me a ton of money, I just want to be comfortable & capable of taking care of myself & a family one day. Job wise I can feel like I'm stuck between a rock & a hard place. I've never been stellar at school & don't have a desire to go back. I feel more accomplished through learning hands on & working my way up but there's only so much I can do (or can't do). 
1	I don't think so. I'm going for nursing with goals to be a nurse practitioner with a PhD so I can do research too. I feel secure in my financial future. But I think it's a totally valid concern to have considering a lot of humanitarian jobs can be low paying. I still urge you to do what fulfills you! \n\nI posted here a while ago asking about everyone's career if you wanted to check that out. The diversity was pretty surprising honestly! And I think  a lot of us have been doing just fine :)\n\nEdit: formatting 
1	Money does not make you happy.
1	Fuck no. I work in financial services and I really enjoy what I do. It isn't a typical ENFJ career but it's challenging and I like it. I would love to be a teacher but fuck getting paid peanuts. Maybe when I'm older and financially secure I'll try that.\n\nOr really I'll probably start my own business doing something else at some stage, who knows what. I have a long time to try things out :) 
1	My ENFJ dad is a software architect. He travels a lot and does meet a lot of people but i suppose it isn’t the most people oriented job anyway. He absolutely thrives there because of his good presenting skills and being able to lead. He still loves it and earns a pretty decent amount.\n\n\nMy ENFJ self is training to become a doctor which has LOTS of people interaction and the ability to help people, and nice pay too. The ability to help people all day and night is why I want to do it so much.\n\nI think most jobs have at least a bit of interaction involved, enough to make an ENFJ happy. Then there’s also what they do outside of work. I think an ENFJ can go into whatever career to be honest. :) 
1	Hi. What are these career paths you resonate with?\n\nI’m ENFJ and looking to make a career change - would love to learn what you have found so far!
5	Question	I made a post with a link to a new discord server. Is that not allowed or something? Cant see it.
3	Private message me if you want it I guess. 
1	Anyhow. I think the post must have gotten auto-removed or something else went wrong because nobody is answering this question. Here is the link:  [https://discord.gg/26DXkM9](https://discord.gg/26DXkM9) 
1	You post was removed because there's a sticky where all discord links should go.\n\nFor a while this sub was inundated with links to discord and we all voted to have them removed and have them contained to one thread. 
29	The most ENFJ words ever spoken	
2	love this...
1	This man is amazing!! 
1	Is he not ENFP?
2	Am I an INFJ or ENFJ?	NFJs have a great ability to socialize with people. INFJs can even be mistaken as extroverted, because they are so full of energy when engaged with other people. With that said, how can I tell if I am introverted or extroverted?\n\nI used to be dominantly extroverted, however, recent events in the past couple of years have resulted in difficulty finding emotion in anything.  I see the power we possess over people through our natural charisma, and my changing moral alignment has caused me to be curious about what would happen if I used this to my advantage.\n\nI don't seek to make friends actively, and I only need a handful to be content. I'm very loyal to my relationships, and I try to maintain them as much as possible. I enjoy socializing, and I sometimes take the initiative to invite others to hang out. I don't have patience when it comes to people being stupid, and I am often vocally straightforward about my opinions. When it comes to intimacy, I find it extremely difficult to open up. I often prioritize logic over emotion, however, I could be conditioned that way as a man.\n\nI often find myself going silent in the presence of extroverted personalities. I enjoy it, because that means I don't have to actively try to lead the conversation. My extroverted friends find me quiet, while my introverted friends find me talkative Often I find myself wanting alone time, but other times I yearn to hang out with friends.\n\nI see my extroversion as a tool to make friends and be well liked, but I believe that I may be introverted by nature.  Any opinions would be appreciated <3
4	Felt the need to register and share after seeing this post. (10 years of trying to avoid Reddit down the drain LOL). I'm (most likely) an ENFJ that went through a typing journey from ENTJ>INTJ>INFJ>ENFJ, so I feel like I might be able to help a little bit. \n\nFirst off, I'd say that you're still actively processing major negative thoughts/emotions, which are not going to help typing. I've been through a similar extended run,  so what you're processing now is going to be different than when you're on more stable footing.\n\nSecondly, if you're trying to get into type distinctions, I would focus on the cognitive function stack. If you truly are ENFJ over INFJ, there are going to be a couple differences that jump out at you:\n\na) Because of higher Se and Fi, ENFJs tend to be more actively socially experimenting--i.e. they feel really cued in to social cues, and adjust their behavior almost instanteously as they receive feedback. ENFJs are usually consciously or unconsciously looking to test the limits of social acceptability in each situation so that they can find out what is acceptable and then unthinkingly operate within those margins.\n\nb) ENFJs are usually more action-oriented than INFJs--the INFJs I know are OK with sitting around all weekend and doing nothing, whereas I would be going crazy. I feel like I need to be productive.\n\nc) What stresses you more: having a job that depended on your athletic performance in a new sport, or having a job that depended on you accurately producing thousands of numbers daily without a mistake on an entirely new report? Se is higher in the cognitive stack for ENFJ, so sports would be less stressful. To an ENFJ who works in Finance (me!) with similar performance requirements, every time a report is produced that requires that hundreds of numbers be accurate, it is extremely stressful. I imagine that the reverse would be true for an INFJ.\n\nd) ENFJs tend to be more worried about getting a promotion and having a more prestigious career than INFJs.\n\nd) You can always watch a lot of INFJ youtube videos and see if you really identify with the sentiments expressed therein. That's one way I began to realize that I wasn't quite an INFJ--I was just a little bit different than the views expressed therein. Enough differences stacked up so that I realized that I was probably an ENFJ. It's ok! The cognitive functions are very, very similar, so it can be really tricky for someone who's spent a lot of time developing an inferior function.\n\nRegarding your thinking comment, ENFJs can reshape their entire perspective based on upbringing, so you might hold thinking as an extremely high value, without ever really having examined it much yourself. I would say that this definitely happened to me. It can lead to extremely well-developed inferior functions, but can stunt growth of primary functions. It can also lead to a mis-evaluation of the importance of those functions. Just give things time, and some thought. Allow your Ni to whir away in the background, and you'll probably come to an answer after a few weeks. You'll know yourself better than anyone else, and the truth of your typing.
2	sounds like you're an introvert. Hmm... can you survive not getting out of your house arrest for 3 days and 3 nights? extroverts usually tend to get uneasy by night 2. \n\nedit: can you explain your difficulties to find emotionin anything? Having an episode of the blues or somethng similar can alter a person's behavior. Maybe you turn a little quieter when an episode like this is happening.
2	It's about how you recharge your battery. I'm an INFJ and I get drained to death after meeting people no matter how much I can need them. Apparently extroverts feel more energy in a crowd... The over stimulation is killing me in places with loud music, loads of people, and those damn laser lights.
7	A continuation on post "is this an enfj thing? No offense". UPDATE	So this enfj bff of mine is somewhat clingy and can be overdramatic on tiniest things . On my post " is this an enfj thing no offense" , ive discussed his both positive and negative behavior.\n\nLast sunday, I was able to confront him on fb messenger. I told him to ( i started first with a no offense but...) promise me not to call me everyday even though he would go out on his own as phone calls are disruptive and they are bothersome. I also told him on messenger to lessen the frequency of phone call and respect my choices as a friend. He replied to me that if thats how i want it to be then he will respect my decisions and lessen his phone calls. He also added that he doesnt want someone living in a misery. \n\ndays after sunday, he messaged me he was having a bad because his manager was treating him and his co workers poorly. He then texted and asked me if i was free for phone calls and i answered no. He told me it was okay . He asked me when would i be available again because he couldnt take anymore. Again, i was pissed ( light) again so i replied to him  i dont know and i have some other things to do. He told me it was okay. I told him to just message me about his manager and he complied. Our conversation on fb messenger didnt last long though.\n\nIm starting to think he forgot what i said about the boundaries. Yes he can be dramatic and when he needs someone to vent on, i on the top list. \n\nFriends dont need to talk everyday right? I mean  he can have someone to vent on . What  i mean is that a person wont always be available for your comfort\n\nwhat do you guys think\n
9	I know how your friend feels, and yeah I need to talk to someone everyday to not feel like crap tbh. It doesn't have to be the same person every time, but clearly your friend feels a connection to you and they prefer to go to you over others. I have people I prefer to take my issues to as well, like I don't feel fully "settled" on something until I have their input on a situation. I don't think he's just gossiping to you, he's probably trusts your opinions on things and wants to know your take. \n\nCombine that with, while yes we are the most introverted of the extroverts, we are still extroverts. We do need social interaction to remain positively charged. \n\n  \nAt this point, I'm not so sure if it's actually an issue with him, so much as you're annoyed that he's still coming to you... A couple of days of just, *not talking,* is a long time for us. And it hurts on the inside to have connections severed like that. We are in *constant* communication with others, especially with those whom we trust and hold close, and if that's something that bothers you that's going to be a real issue and a recipe to really hurt your friend. Assuming you care about their feelings. They are trying, because like I said, a few days for you is *forever* to us. Especially if those emotions are at full boil under the surface and he *needs* to talk about it to release the tension.   \n\n\nPeople say ENFJs are over-dramatic, but that has the implication that we're playing things up to get a reaction from people. That really isn't the case. ***We really, really do feel as intensely as we state we do.*** Those emotions are at full pressure right under the surface, and oftentimes if we're stressed out or upset we just **need** to talk it out. And yeah, sometimes stress will continue for a long time, days to weeks.  \n\n\nA lot of us seek out that super close bond, the friend we can talk to everyday. The friend we can spend our time with, who makes us feel happy to talk to. It seems like he hopes you are that friend for him, either that or he has feelings for you.   \n\n\nAlso, we know what social boundaries are, but every person is different. He seems like he wants to be close friends with you, which can really blur the lines of what kind of behavior is okay vs what isn't. Sometimes I'm not sure if I'm being overbearing either, and I've lost friends to these kinds of situations because I just *genuinely don't understand* why others don't want to talk all the time. Realistically, yes I know. But inside? Emotionally? I always feel the need to be around others. I don't have to be talking so long as I'm at least around the people that make me feel better, it keeps me stable. Every situation is different of course, but consider that perhaps he's just more maintenance as a friend. \n\nHe's probably not even aware of what you consider to be overstepping boundaries and may feel awkward now that you've "confronted" him on it, especially if you weren't *explicitly* clear on exactly what you consider to be a boundary. If all you said was "Hey, stop talking to me every single day it's annoying, but we're still friends so you can still talk to me," do you see how that may be confusing? What's clear to you may not be to him.\n\nI suggest actually talking this out with him rather than just "laying down the law." He seems like he needs clarification on it. Tell him how you feel, honestly. And suggest to him how he can make it better rather than just expecting him to know what you want automatically because you think it should be obvious. \n\n*(I realize some of this sounds aggressive, but it's not meant in that way. Sorry.)*
3	Honestly, I would find ways to recommend therapy if he's in a place to afford it. Something along the lines of 'I really appreciate our friendship, but I can't be your go-to source to filter through your negative life experiences. I think therapy would teach you how to manage these experiences better, and find a balance that will help us find a comfortable groove that doesn't feel burdensome.' Whether he argues or agrees, he'll likely come to you to vent again, and you need to repeat this messaging until it sinks in for him. I've balked a therapy my whole life, and am only now realizing how many friendships I've burned out due to not getting appropriate treatment/training sooner. It's very easy for ENFJs to get in a place where they expect therapy from others because we love playing therapy for others (and often went through the 'co-therapy' experience with at least one parental unit) - it starts to feel like 'this is natural. this is was love is.' \n\nBut it's not. Caring about others is about learning to handle yourself enough to be a positive vector for those around you. These may either be growing pans or a permanent state of maladjustment, depending on how much he's willing to work on it. The best you can do is show him the path, repeat it, and not enable his current non-ideal path. 
2	I would frame my thoughts as follows:\n\n1) These are all pretty standard ENFJ needs, if a little more extreme than usual\n\n2)  It's probably not healthy to project this all on one non-romantic relationship.\n\n3) Your friend really, really, really wants to talk over the phone with you and is not behaving very healthy with regards to that\n\n4) TBH, part of this is just S/N dynamic that will always sort of exist (ISFJ/ENFJ parent pair experience). I don't think it'll get much better without dramatic changes in personal development.\n\nTell him to write all of his stream-of-consciousness thoughts, completely uncensored, every single day, 2 pages worth, and send to you. Fe's just need to get that Fe vomit out of the system, so if he's willing to do that and you can respond with some kind of understanding, he'll likely get better. He's probably having difficulties now with the writing them because he's self-censoring, but just get him to vomit out everything every day for 2 pages worth, and it'll be helpful for that Fe processing.\n\nI'm speaking from experience on that 2 pages per day thing. If he's not willing to do that, you can respond by telling him that he's obviously valuing his fears above your friendship as well as his own well-being and that he needs to get his act together. Bring out the big guns! LOL.
1	he asked and when you said no he complied. what about that is not respecting your boundaries, or am I misreading the post
96	Saw one of you guys in my city yesterday	
5	Oh New Hampshire, stahp it...
4	Such an ENFJ thing hahaha
11	Are there any ENFJ sources that are more internally focused?	A lot of sources I read about ENFJs tend to focus on our externally focused personas, which totally makes sense, especially with high Fe. But sometimes it feels like what I'm reading makes us sound so people-oriented to the point of vapidity. I feel like ENFJs can be very complex and deep thinking, but I don't often find any material on how that looks (if ever). Are there sources that focus on how we think about ourselves?\n\nDoes anyone else feel that way or is this more about me embarking on a difficult self-reflective journey, or?...
8	I hear you! You can say that I’ve been on a mission in this subreddit to focus on deeper aspects of the enfj personality beyond the relationship building and care we give to others. There is a whole side of the enfj personality which is not clearly understood but far more interesting, things ENFJs find difficult to describe like their FeNi intuition or even confront like the shadow of their enfj personality. \n\nA good starting point to research this side of the personality is by googling “ENFJ introverted thinking.” This should provide you with lots of great resources on this topic. 
6	I’m an ENFJ but this summer I’ve been feeling pretty internally-focused (not necessarily introverted) I’m outgoing but it’s refreshing to take some time to think, and stuff.\n(I’m not good at explaining this stuff lol) :)
2	I've been looking for these for a while, and here's what I've found:\n\n\#1 recommended: [https://personalityhacker.com/podcast-episode-0090-enfj-personality-type-advice/](https://personalityhacker.com/podcast-episode-0090-enfj-personality-type-advice/) \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VctAHCS8CRg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VctAHCS8CRg)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ted-I-QR0RI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ted-I-QR0RI)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsNfioapSxU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsNfioapSxU)\n\n[http://enfjmusings.tumblr.com/page/3](http://enfjmusings.tumblr.com/page/3) 
7	INFP	What do you all think of INFP's generally? I've heard that we can get along well
9	Great listeners and trustworthy friends. I see this pairing more than any other on this subreddit. We complement each other well and have a good feedback loop of keeping each other grounded
5	Recently, my best friend from elementary school found me on facebook and reached out to me.  I asked him to take the test today because I was super curious as to where his personality would land, I figured we'd have some overlap.  He's ENFJ and I'm INFP, after reading through the ENFJ profile, it completely made sense to me why we were drawn to eachother as kids.  It also makes sense why he was the one brave enough to reach out, I had thought about him frequently but I was afraid that he'd either forgotten me or didn't care to reconnect.  \n\nBeing back in touch has made me so happy, we're both now in our 30s and it's amazing how similar our lives have turned out, we're both gay and went through similar trials and tribulations, except where I would have crumbled and fallen apart he was able to overcome those obstacles and rise above it.  In my opinion at least, it makes for a wonderful friendship.
5	INFPs are incredibly sweet, genuine, honest, and caring people.  My cousin is one and she is just a joy to be around. \n\nMy most recent ex is an INFP.  We dated for about 8 months.  He was wayyyyy too quiet for me.  We could not have quality conversations and there would be a lot of silence which made me feel uncomfortable.  Most ENFJs need external affirmation, especially verbal, and he was unable to give me even a tiny bit of that.  He did not share feelings and thoughts or experiences with me so I did not feel like we connected at all.  We broke up in a very kind and respectful way and we still care about each other, but we both knew we were not at all a good match.  We both agreed that we treated each other better than anyone else has treated us in the past but it just could not have worked.  I think he was extremelyyyyy introverted though, more than most people.  
2	There are many post about Infps just skimm through old post with the tag of Infp. There are interesting posts. From my experience I know one Enfj and one maybe Enfj maybe Enfp. Both are smooth as fuck with talking. Small talk went out the window and we went real deep real fast. I can see why we like them so much. The attention they give is so inviting and our awkwardness isn't a problem. 
13	ENFJs trying to 'fix people'	My ENFJ boyfriend told me that his exes have constantly complained that he always tried to 'fix' them.\n\nHe has strongly pressured them to 'Study more and get into university so you can start a career" or "Find a better job" or "Wear more expensive clothes" or "Don't be so disorganised". And if they did not fix their problems, he would break up with them. And for that, he has never been dumped once in his young life, but he has also never tried to do long-term in his whole life either.\n\nThis is quite worrying for me.. when we first met he constantly complimented my looks, my career, my education and told me that "I think I finally found someone that I can do long-term with" and has often talked to me about our long-term future since. But now he is pressuring me about how I dress, how I do my hair, to lose more weight, to look like some kind of Instagram superstar. (I am an XS and I work in the fashion media industry. So I don't know what else I can do for him...). It's completely about my looks...I am conventionally attractive, I've worked as a model as well. I'm really not here to brag.. I'm just trying to explain my confusion with his behaviour towards me.. since I think I am fine the way I am.. I have worked very hard to become the woman I wanted to be, and for him to tell me the way he does, is quite hurtful since I don't even put that much value in beauty over other things. \n\nAm I going to just end up being dumped too over... errr... not being XXS? I've talked to him about it and  have told him that I will be the one to dump him at this rate. He has told me 'Sorry' "Don't take offense cos I didn't mean to offend" "You're really beautiful, I'll try to stop pressuring you about your looks"\n\nI've heard this was an ENFJ thing. But what do you ENFJs think of it? Explain him for me please!
16	You shouldn't be in a relationship where you feel criticized. Tell him to back off. This is probably less an ENFJ thing and more the way his fear of rejection is manifesting. If you want to make this work, you can try easing his insecurities by complimenting or validating him more often. Or he could just be a jackass who wants to be with somebody who makes him look good.
10	Nah not an enfj thing. This behavior can be found across many personalities. The advice everyone else provided is basically what I wanted to say
9	This is pretty straight forward. ENFJs are very other aware and have little self-awareness, and by that I mean primarily of their emotions. Enfjs have the propensity for emotional turbulence being strong feeling types, and also identity turbulence. They are aware of the issue, but find it difficult to control. When you find it difficult to understand or control your emotions you end up trying to control your environment. Enfjs seek to build harmony in their environments and want to build a better world. But they also want to create a nurturing environment for themselves. They want to create an image of themselves, be known to be a nice person, helpful, social, successful, charitable, and charming. When something or someone is not helping them accomplish that, they try to solve the problem. The identify turbulence could mean one day they are content with what they have, and the next day they want to be the outdoorsy type and conquer nature, etc. Now suddenly the people around them are no longer the people helping them accomplish their goals. They struggle with wanting to let their partners be who they want to be, and being a drag on their new goals. They do not want to feel confined. ENFJs can go through long periods of reflective thinking and they usually emerge a different person with different wants and needs. ENfJs females go through the same thing as men. Their partner usually will find everything very exciting at first, everyone is fulfilled and happy. But after the reflective period they could wrongly identify problems with their environment rather than themselves. The problem is their identity turbulence. But the way they see it coming out of the reflective period is as these people around me are not allowing me to reach my full potential in life. The problem lies with them! The people around them are left baffled because here they helped them through their down period and nurtured them exactly as they wanted, and they emerge from it by almost seeing their friends and partners as no longer necessary. “I need new friends”. “I would like to move to a new place.” “I suddenly would like a girlfriend who likes these other things I like now.” People no longer serve their ends. They will not admit it, and end up being critical. \n\nThis happens, generally speaking, during the 18-28 years. And is due to the ENFJ having undeveloped their inferior function. They do not understand themselves during this period, but will eventually and hopefully come out of it during their late 20s if they attempt to resolve the issues. Being with an ENFJ is a great experience, it’s almost like being in a magical realm. Their moral and ethical framework they live their lives with is very unique be complex based off of the totality of the people they met and their life experiences. Their intuition is well developed, they identify problems and find solutions for others around them all the time. They are caring and loving. But they aren’t perfect. It’s up to the ENFJ to realize the issues they have and to working through them to hopefully become a better person. \n\nI will also add that Myers Briggs does not identify underlying mental health issues. Narcissism, depression, BPD, HPD, NPD and bipolar disorder could coexist with any Myers Briggs type. Be sure to look into that in general. Hope this helped, and sorry for the long rant!\n
13	I’m an enfj. And I never tell anyone they aren’t good enough. And they need to try harder. \n\nThat’s not an enfj. That’s an asshole. \n\nDo what you want with that information. \n\n

8	I'm not ENFJ, I'm the smaller version of their being - INFJ, but wow, I definitely feel his dominant feeling extroversion function. Our types always think we want to save others, but fail to realize we're guilty of our own fault. The only way to deal with this is head on confrontation. \n\nFrom my perspective, he's quite controlling - don't meet his terms, he disassociates with you. Always place boundaries. To me, his apology doesn't seem genuine, or much effort. However if you're too worried about this relationship, dump him and leave him in the dust. Anyway as an Fe user, we always think to ourselves this perfect version of everyone else and that just leads to heavy downfall in the long run. I would consider couples counseling to be on the safe side. :)
4	It's natural for us to see what WE think could be improved in others, but that doesn't mean it's what you want and right for you. He seems overly fixated on changing people (partners in this case), which I find more normal in younger ENFJs. What you're doing in setting boundaries and communicating with him is great though. 
3	I am ENFJ. We also look for strength. Tell him you’re fine the way you are, and that personal improvement is motivated from within, not by insults and tear downs. He’ll either respect you and accept it, or walk. And honestly, if he walks, let him. Someone wanting that much control over someone else has bigger issues than jut being ENFJ.
6	This feels more like toxic controlling behavior over ENFJ, tbh. I'd start looking for other indicators you're dealing with a sociopath. \n\nControlling behavior, this belief that your 'different' during the new, fresh relationship period followed by ramping up criticism, are pretty telltale signs. Read a bunch of articles about other sociopath flags and see if any are familiar or become familiar.\n\nI wouldn't try to stay and 'change' him, that never works. If the amount of feedback you've provided so far doesn't elicit change - its time to move on. IMO, People only really learn to remove this behavior from themselves when it costs them something good.
3	That sounds like a really toxic and unhealthy relationship. Honestly, that level of control could easily escalate into an abusive relationship. Get out while you can. 
3	I'm an enfj. We like to help, teach, fix, and problem solve... Even when the recipient doesn't want it. A healthy enfj knows their boundaries and when to stop.\n\nHowever, this type of behavior seems unrelated to personality type. It seems more controlling, unhappy, and insecure. It sounds like he is unhappy with himself, and takes it out on other people. Since this is a pattern for him, it seems to me that he has always had some deep insecurities and issues he is not willing to deal with and work on bettering himself.\n\n And **no one,** especially your partner, has a right to criticize your appearance.
2	May I ask what is your personality?
2	Your BF making you feel bad about yourself is not ok. Someone who wants to help someone grow does not tear  them down. Iam an ENFJ and I have been working on myself to not come off as critical and controlling of others. I would like to think I have gotten better at recognizing when my advice is welcome vs. when I need to mind my own business. He needs to understand that his behaviour is hurtful to you and needs to stop it, period. His personality is not in any way an excuse for his behavior and it sort of sounds like he is using it as a crutch. He has no right to try to change you and it sounds rather shallow of him to be fixated on how he wants you to look. His behaviour is not fair to you :(.
2	aah enfjs. They can be amazing to be with or they can be your worse companion ( not all enfjs).\n\nHe is somewhat an unheathy enfj. I suggest you should confront him about the situation and lessen the tension
3	I tend to "psychoanalise" women I date. They think I am psychic, but I am just very observant and can read between the lines in what they said or how they acted. A gift and a curse!
5	Fe: an instinctive function for people pleasing or a function that gives you seemless insight to others psyches?	Hello all, trying to type myself so wondering what Fe means to you guys? Im pretty sure its in my stack but im trying to work out how high it is. Im a little confused by the actual definition of Fe, it is often described as a function that just wants to help people and this feels too shallow of a definition. \n\nI am very aware of how people perceive me, wether they are comfortable with me and the vibes in the room, for example: Me and my INFP cousin turned up at a party kinda uninvited, when we walked in no one knew us apart our friend who let us, hopelessly he didnt introduce us to any of them so it was kinda awkward. I could immediately tell the whole room didnt trust us by looking at them, it made me incredibly uncomfortable too, however my cousin was just dancing away without a care in the world. So pretty sure I use Fe.\n\nHowever I only help people when I want to, I am aware of what help they need but Im not selfless 100% of the time, If I dont like or trust the other person I can kinda turn off my Fe. My grandma is an ESFJ and she is usually doing things for other people not matter who they are, now im kinda like that but I dont treat everyone equally. I tend to treat everyone differently depending on their needs and present myself as the most comfortable person according to their values and boundaries. I spent 3 years out of school being home educated so maybe my Fe is developing weirdly.\n\nLet me know your thoughts on Fe? Or if you can relate to anything I said as an ENFJ?
3	Why not both? :) This stuff is super complicated. The functions seem to mainly be more about how you absorb and evaluate information. They don't necessarily predict what actions you'll take, though I think you can spot trends. I suspect the "seamless insight" is a bit closer to the truth, for what it's worth. And if you have that insight, you could certainly please people better than folks who lack it.   \n\n\nWe have to keep in mind how the functions manifest in the context of a neurotic and anxious human mind. For an NTP, I'm very much a people pleaser because my low Fe detects the emotional atmosphere **and** my anxiety finds negative emotions unbearble. To save myself from undue suffering, I will attend to people's needs. Other Fe users might find it easy to coexist with a negative mood, even if they definitely notice it. I've found that some ENTPs use their Fe awareness to push the buttons of others, whereas I'd rather use the aware as a springboard for connection and mutual vulnerability.
1	Insight to other psyche is Ni function.\n\nFeeling extroversion is basically just pleasing people at its core, adaptability to group values, chameleon like tendencies, and most heartily a concern for the general being. \n\nSource - an INFJ
1	Fe is also a decision making function and it compels people who have it to maintain control in situations concerning the emotional atmosphere of a room and the like. This is usually for the better, but it can be used to manipulate occasionally.
1	Ok thats definitely Fe dominant or secundary, now you need to figure out if you have Ni or Si\nThen you compare your Fe with your "X"i and see wich one is more dominant in your personality, which one you do more often, even if you dont want to, and thats it!\n\nAnd the functions have a generic definition kinda on purpose because it include so many things that a specific definition would be detrimental.\nAlso don't worry about not helping everybody, yes we Fe like to help people but we dont help EVERYBODY, that's just a stereotype. 
35	Do you guys ever feel empty?	Enfj here, and first time on this thread. As an enfj we always try to make other people’s problems our problems, and be the very best people we can be. I’m always the person who’s wearing a smile as a permanent accessory, and everyday is always another day in paradise, because I have a job and am healthy. But just always being positive and never letting the small things get to me, especially when greedy people are really abusing me, is just leaving me feeling so hollow. Like I’m trying to emanate all this positive energy, so other people will take a step back, and hopefully see we’re all humans and be positive as well. But it just doesn’t seem to work. Everyone around me seems so selfish, and it makes me feel as if I’m trying so hard to be this selfless person and it’s not benefiting anything. I’m still going to continue being the best person I can be, I’m just wondering if anyone has found an anecdote in life, where they know it matters. I’m sorry this is a stupid wall of text, and I probably should just go talk to someone, but I’m just feeling so thin. Thanks if anyone actually reads this 
16	>just leaving me feeling so hollow.\n\n +1\n\n>Everyone around me seems so selfish, and it makes me feel as if I’m trying so hard to be this selfless person and it’s not benefiting anything.\n\nLately, I've been feeling this a lot. Not sure how does one deal with it. Maybe, just be ourselves because that's the best we can do. It's like 1 in 50 people actually appreciate or is thankful for it and then makes being positive worth it I guess.\n\nAnd if you do feel like talking, my inbox is always open :)
8	Not an ENFJ, but just in case it helps:\n\nYou may be having more impact and doing more good than you suspect.
2	Yeah, I feel the same way 100%. It's sad always trying to be the best person you can be and helping others, and being mistreated in spite of it (or even because of it, like getting taken advantage of). It hurts a lot and I haven't found a way to get rid of either a) my desire to MAKE!!! EVERYONE!!! HAPPY!!! or b) all the negativity of the people I do try to positively influence when it doesn't work (most of the time lol). But you aren't alone, I promise, if that helps at all. This is one of the most relatable posts I've ever seen.
1	I used to hate myself and think I only existed to affect others, like an object or force
15	Hey ENFJs would you take my MBTI Relationship Survey?	 [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2QSNJPP](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2QSNJPP)\n\nAnyone can take it.\n\nIf you know your and your current or ex partner's mbti, please fill out as many times as you've had partners!\n\nIt's simple and I would love to expand on it in the future but these are all the variables I need to complete my Multivariate Statistics Analysis class. I'll be posting the results.\n\nThank you!
7	What does a close friend mean for you?	I notice how ENFJ tend to classify friends into categories, and I was wondering what does a close friend mean to you?
23	Close friends are the people I talk to on a semi-daily basis, but not only that. They are people I've formed a deep connection to, the ones who actively connect back to me rather than only coming to me when they need/want something.
16	Someone who i have close platonic cuddles with, can talk about emotions as deeply as we want, and whom i am heavily invested in their happiness and pushing them to their goals.
9	Close friends are the ones I feel no embarrassment around, love like they are my family, & could spend hours with doing things or nothing at all. We don't necessarily connect on all levels we just happen to like some similar things & each other very much.
3	Close friends are those who I have seen or helped walk a story circle successfully (google 'Dan Harmon's story circle' if your curious. It's designed as a writer's guide but it's basically a human pattern for individual change/progress). They don't avoid the painful parts of life by projecting outward ('this is their fault') or projecting inward ('this is all my fault'). They accept the losses that comes with living and cultivating your own life, learn their lessons which inform their being, and move on to the next challenge.   \n\n\nThey know I love and support them, but it isn't codependent. Until they reach this point they're roughly categorized as either 'Not yet fully understood friends' / 'Doing their own thing, killing it, but stuck in existing patterns' / 'miscellaneous acquaintances' 
3	Close friends are people I meet and talk to regularly (not really everyday but regularly). They are like family. I can be vulnerable with them and I can show the true me to them without filter. They also do the same with me. I love them for who they truly are. We bond, have deep conversations, give honest advice and opinions to each other, share secrets and problems, and connect deeply.
3	people who got my back and whom I pretty much am completely vulnerable to.  Doesn't matter the rate of conversations, sometimes these friends can be gone for years and when we meet up, it's like no time has passed us by.  It's all about trust
2	Someone I can act myself around, speak to about my troubles, and simply laugh with
2	Close friends... Very limited. \nThey are people who I feel are genuinely worthy and have the same types of morals that I do. People that see life and society the same way that i do. (Again... I find this is RARE)  I have only two CLOSE friends but tons of acquaintances. 
1	close friend means inner circle. we can talk about anything, including real shit when we need to. 
1	Sorry if this comment hijacks the OP, just kind of want to expand on it and know *how many categories of friends you guys have*.
13	ENFJ and INTP romantic pairing stories?	I'm an ENFJ (f) in a romantic relationship with an INTP (m), and I've been scouring the internet for interactions with this pairing for stories and experiences. I'm pretty well acquainted with both types and I'm aware of the cognitive function stack as well as interactions between the two types, both on a personal and observed level. I love reading what others in a similar situation have encountered and would love to read more! I'm very interested in reading personal insights or small anecdotes these two types may have with each other.\n\nI personally feel a very deep connection with my SO, we've only been dating for a few months, but we've been very close friends for a few years. We play video games together almost daily and that's how we initially got to know each other. He's my best friend, and I love listening to him talk about the things that hold his interest. His excitement is adorable and endearing to me. I really appreciate his genuine affection for me, and he really pays attention to what I have to say.  \n\n\nI'd like to read anything you guys may have, good or bad. :\]
9	Hi there! \nI'm a I/ENFJ (f) dating INTP bf. Early stages of the relationship (<few months seeing each other) so likely still in that 'honeymoon' phase. However, we were close friends for a year prior so we know each other pretty well. \n\nI felt an instant attraction to him, I developed romantic feeling very early on from meeting him. His intelligence and unique humour were very endearing to me. As well as his good looks haha ;) \n I felt we instantly 'clicked' which is something I experience very rarely. We both had other relationships during our friendship, but personally I always felt my heart was set on him. After both our relationships ended we became more 'intimate', flirting and such with each other. I think we could both tell the other liked us.\n\nNow, here we are, bf and gf. He is kind, supportive and very honest with me, which I appreciate. He always manages to make me laugh, even when I'm having the worst day imaginable. I feel like I can be my truest self with him, with no fear of judgment, only support. I trust him wholly. \n\nHe enjoys video games, which I'm not such a fan of, but do play sometimes as I know he enjoys it. We mostly enjoy watching tv shows together, talking and generally chilling out. Just being in each other's company I suppose. \nAll's well so far :) \n\n(Apologies for long post!)
6	I'm engaged to an ISTP as an ENFJ and I'll say that it definitely presents it's own set of challenges. I've never met someone I get along with so well and have so many things in common with. That being said, I am EXTREMELY vocal, on all fronts. Emotions, people, very outgoing in general. He is quite outgoing around friends but hates being in social situations and we regularly disagree about how to handle emotions and disagreements. He likes to "walk away" when we're arguing and that drives me insane because I want to stay there and fix it with our words. We always work things out but it might take a little longer because he doesn't always feel ready to discuss things until he's had a chance to think. I think any combination of people can work together as long as they have the right things in common and are willing to work at succeeding!
6	I've (ENFJ,  f) have been with my (INTP, m) for over 3 years. Everything you've said is very similar to our relationship. We play video games often, or find anything we both enjoy and do it pretty constantly like binge watching our favorite shows. One thing I've noticed is that he usually needs motivation to prioritize school and work because these things seem like busy work to him but I usually enjoy helping as long as he asks and puts in the effort. He's very caring and always listens to me. He's very honest so I don't feel like we ever have anything to hide! We both want to marry eachother sometime in the near future!
5	I'm your guy. What do you want to know? \n\nYeah we're great friends and she also loves my passion and excitement. Pretty much everything you said here. 
4	I love how most these stories so far have playing video games in common haha\n\nMine isn’t romantic but the INTP (m) I’m friends with is  very special to me. I joined a game server he was on and he was the loudest one on there. He has a really distinctive voice which I like and he is a very enthusiastic socialiser behind the safety of a computer screen lol\n\nHe likes to keep people at arms length but I easily felt something was going on behind the bravado he displayed and probed him. I just had this feeling about him you know? Like there was a lot to him he wasn’t letting on and that he was actually looking for some deeper connection but didn’t know how to go about it. I can totally relate to that as an ENFJ.\n\nI started talking to him and he always tells me he is surprised how fast he opened up to me and told me th things he has. I was right about him going through something. He had just had a really hard breakup and likened our chats to therapy. We have had very similar life experiences but because of our different personalities when we talk through them we both show each other another side to consider. There is also a deep understanding and comradeship between us that’s just there.\n\nPeople find him very polarising but that’s because I don’t think they realise INTPs have ALOT of opinions and are quite passionate but when they bring them up they often decide half way through they want to keep up a neutral facade and pretend they don’t really care about the discussion or argument, so they backtrack and make out like they were just shit stirring cause they were bored. It rubs a lot of people the wrong way but I can usually disarm the situation or help him smooth out his delivery. Deep down he is kind and even though he might seem abrasives is just wants the best for people and wants to help.\n\nHe is also quite mature for his age and very caring (but he won’t let just anyone know that). He’s also a horrible procrastinator. He is also a pretty low maintenance friend since he’s enjoys time in his own world and I can tend to the people in mind with no hard feelings. When we do come back to catch up we always have new stories we can’t wait to share.\n\nI think INTP and ENFJ have the potential for a deep, caring and understanding friendship. We are pretty accepting of each other but also watch each other’s back. \n\nHope this helps :)
14	What is just friendly for you and what is flirting?	If an ENFJ likes you as just as friend would they still talk to you for long periods of time, even sacrificing sleep and such? \n\nI know from previous experiences that people with the ENFJ personality type tend to be really nice in general and I honestly can't tell what the difference is between whether they want to be just friends or more. I'm an NF myself so I really thought I would be able to read them but I feel like there are a lot of mixed signals.\n\nWhat do you think would constitute flirting? Are ENFJs very direct?
13	Yeah ENFJs will talk to platonic friends for hours and sometimes sacrifice sleep. If they want to indicate romantic interest they will probably directly tell you, as ENFJs are usually pretty assertive and direct people. I've had male ENFJs flirt with me and usually they say obviously romantic stuff like "you would be an easy person to fall in love with" and so forth. If you're really unsure and you like them, I would just tell them how you feel and consider asking them on a date (unless they are unavailable of course). 
10	I'll talk all night with anyone who I feel a connection with, or just someone who needs an outlet. I've been the person strangers in MMO's, Discord servers, and chat rooms just unload on because they need it. I personally don't have feelings for these people romantically in any sense of the word, I'm more or less helping them help themselves. Sometimes people just need a void to scream into and I don't have an issue listening.  \n\n\nIn general, if I have romantic feelings for someone, I shy away from my own emotions and try to distract myself... but I'll also want their company constantly. I will actively look for opportunities to hang out with them, and my version of flirting is doing acts of service for them. They need help with something? I volunteer! They mention that they really like this thing? I'll get them or make them the thing. I will do everything in my power to show how much I care for them, and I'll try to become more involved with the things they have an interest with. They will become my number one priority. I almost always end up telling them how I feel in the end because the emotions are too strong for me to keep bottled up.   \n\n\nI'm also very, very loyal. I tend to shut down outside advances because I'm only interested in one person. Sometimes the shut down is cold if I feel the person is ignoring my boundaries, but otherwise I try to let people down as nicely as I can.   \n\n\nHonestly if you're really wondering, you should just ask them plainly. Whenever anyone asks me a direct question like that, I give an honest answer even if it's embarrassing or awkward for me to do so.
5	Yes, I have problems with that most of the time, because people tend to misinterpret my actions. I always go to great lengths to make my loved ones happy, to be with my loved ones, to do things for my loved ones, etc. I would sacrifice a lot even if it is platonic. For me, I shouldn't take for granted my family and friends, that's why I see to it that I give them all the love I can give. If it is romantic, it is very obvious for me. I am very direct with my feelings. I would also do romantic stuff for the person like crochet stuff for the person, give handmade crafts to the person, write poems to the person, write extra extra extra long handwritten letters for that person (I usually write handwritten letters for all my loved ones, but it is super long if it is romantic and quite romantic), I bombard the person with gifts, etc. I even gave flowers to my romantic interest in Valentine's Day even if we are just friends. I am really direct and actually aggressive when it comes to romance. I don't think anyone would second guess, because even if I try to hide it, it is really very obvious that the person is special. :)
4	Yes, I’m married and have long conversations with people male and female if they’re keeping my interest, but also would do that with people I was interested in before I was in a committed relationship. 
2	I'll stay up to talk to anyone who needs it personally\n
11	How is an ENFJ meant to use Tinder?	Alright so I've finally worked myself into a place where I am happy with myself and comfortable, but I feel like I'd really benefit from an actual relationship right now. A friend talked me into downloading tinder and I was wondering what kinds of experiences other ENFJs have had using the app? \n\nReally I see the app as a way to get the ball rolling when I would normally hesitate to introduce myself in public, but I don't know if I would be comfortable using cheap one-liners and going for quick hookups\n\nEdit: Should probably add I'm male, but hearing female perspectives is nice since it helps to understand other people's opinions going into the app
19	I’m an ENFJ and met my INTJ boyfriend of over a year on Tinder! Some of my best practices:\n- if you like them, message first..yolo\n- we get attached quick so I’d only bother talking to someone you see real long-term potential in\n- BE YOURSELF\n\nGood luck! Hope you find what you’re looking for 😊
7	ENFJ here, been using Tinder on and off for a couple of years (off now because I've been with my boyfriend I met on there for over 4 months now).\n\nIf you don't want to go for quick hookups, that's fine, I just made it clear on my profile and otherwise that wasn't me. It has the reputation of being only a hookup app but that can't be further from the truth. Yes some people do look there for hook-ups but not every one.\n\nAny guys/girls I've met up with have been because I've had a good, long conversation with them. I rarely use pickup lines and have found that more often than not, they haven't followed through dates with me - my last couple relationships from it started with 'hey whats up' and asking me a question to start the conversation.\n\nGood luck if you do! I found it nice to meet people and date, it was fun
5	I'm an ENFJ and I met my ENFP boyfriend of almost 3 years on Tinder! I like it because I got to talk to a bunch of different of people I wouldn't have likely talk to before. However, I was getting tired of some of the surface level conversation with some of the guys I was talking to. Luckily, I met my now boyfriend there after about a month of using the app. A lot of the guys would use cheesy one-liners, but my boyfriend just started out by just saying "Hey, how are you?" and we had much better conversations than I had with the guys who tried lame pick-up lines. 
5	Tinder to me is more of a hit it and quit it app. But there's chance for love in general. I'm female and meet my infp boy at a club
3	are you male/female? as a female, I liked Bumble better because I'm the one who starts the conversation. also I found the males in Bumble aren't as 'sleazy'. I need to have a decent conversation with someone before meeting up with them. I've also had some luck with Tinder when I used to use it, but preferred Bumble. 
4	I met a lot of great people on tinder. friends mostly. two boyfriends (I'm gay). they changed my life. the first one got me out of my parent's house and really smiling for the first time since I was a little kid. hands down most generous man I have ever met and I will never be able to repay him. second one who I'm with right now, it's just surreal how perfect we are for each other and he's teaching me a lot about the kind of person I want to be. 
3	I met my SO on tinder (hes an ISFJ) - I kinda just used it thinking whatever you never know what you'll get - and I messaged him first and then we just did kinda a friend-based thing and chatted for 3-weeks online.\n\nAll I did was just refernce something from his bio and asked about it so it doesn't need to be cheesy but just showing a little interest in something to get the ball rolling. \n\nSometimes other times I did that it faded fast but there are good people on there really looking for the same thing. 
2	ENFJ Female Mannerisms	I am a male INFJ who is still recovering from some heartbreak with my ENFJ ex - I was the one who broke up with her, which also devastated her.\nI felt a tremendous connection between us, honestly haven't felt that connection before, but I started to get really bothered by a few things as time went on.\n1) I felt most of the time that I was in a relationship with a 'non-person'. She was very serving and loving to me, but at the same time, I felt like she suppressed herself, and I didn't really get to know her as a person, which led to a tremendous feeling of distance.\n2) Related to the above - despite ENFJs having a reputation for being very genuine, I felt that she was very disingenuous. It was like she had no opinions on anything. I deal with my own romantic insecurities, which a lot of times would be seemingly triggered by a general lack of what seemed like disinterest on her part. Just a blank look on her face with a lot of 'ya' and 'mhmm'  responses - kind of like she wasn't really interested.\n3) She was very chatty, which I would almost consider catty. If I had a dollar for every time she said 'that's stupid' or 'this is dumb', I would be a very rich man. There were a lot of critical, judgmental comments toward others people that really chaffed me and I felt were totally uncalled for - the person who seemingly had no opinions would release them in quick critical bursts. Also complaints about her students at school...just seemed to have a very high opinion of herself and judge others.\n\nDo these things seem to be consistent with the ENFJ personality, or are they more of an individual thing?
4	I think it's more of an individual thing. I (and a lot of us ENFJs) want to make others happy and try, sometimes really hard, to avoid disagreement... but I feel like we also love being ourselves and being able to express our intense emotions, so the thing about not getting to know her even after the passage of a good bit of time seems off. Not gonna lie, sometimes I'll try to present my opinion really gently if it's in disagreement with that of someone I care about, but if we're close (like if we're dating) I definitely wouldn't hold back from saying it at all. Also, the critical/judgmental comments doesn't seem to me like an ENFJ thing at all.
3	ENFJ female here. I’ve given thought to the things you wrote here to reflect how I could be this way and to see if it applies. \n\n1 & 3. I am very “other” focused, so my attention is a lot on others being taken care of, included, and having a good time. Just because I do more listening, keeping the conversation going, probing with questions, and serving— does not mean I have no opinions, principles, or awareness of feelings. There are times when I think out loud or share my feelings. A lot of the time I share anything along the lines of criticism, I’m really looking for others to challenge what I think or seeing if others perceive it differently. I never feel 100% I know someone or a situation until I gather enough information through time and interactions with that person or someone’s judgement I feel I can trust. \n\nI wouldn’t say I’m like this girl you dated though. I rarely use the word “dumb” or “stupid” because it’s easily offensive and I get annoyed with negative words that assumes the speaker has all the information correctly. I leave around 30-50% open that I may not know a person or why they did what they did. Shouldn’t others reveal who they are and be given the chance to share their story? No one is ever going to fit perfectly within expectations or the ideas of what makes a person good or cool to hang out with.  I think it’s okay to give an opinion as long as your open to being wrong. Hopefully you gently challenged your ex to learn more about where her judgements come from and what her value system is like.\n\nAs for the “non-person” or not knowing your ex, with Fe-dominants you need to show deep interest to find out everything about them. I don’t often thinking about myself, except for what I want to do now or in the future, and when I’m self reflecting. The truth is I wish someone showed interest to know me. I have no idea if I’m interesting or even fun. It feels easier to put the attention on others. I don’t know how to talk about myself. I spend a good amount of time getting to know everyone, but rarely do people ask about me. I tried sharing about myself this year and before I finished sharing some of my experiences, people would just start talking about their stories. I’m not really sure what to do in those situations. It seems silly to get mad or annoyed so I just move on. \n\nI can have a lot deep conversations with people so I wonder if your ex did and if you got to know her better through that.\n\nWhat was #2? I’m going to send this first\n\n
1	I used to be an unhealthy ENFJ. Some of the behaviours displayed by your ex do line up with some things I used to do sometimes. Though I’m pretty much healthy now, I do still have some self destructing behaviours that I’m trying to get rid of.\n\nI had an intense need to be liked. Therefore, I’d go with the flow of whatever the other person was saying and perhaps hold back my own opinions at the time because I just wouldn’t want to disagree with them. I had a strong fear of rejection and would always assume that people would think my true feelings were stupid or weird. I used to, and still have a negative habit of “reject others before they reject you.” This especially applies to people I really like. If I get even a tiny hint that someone isn’t interested in something, or if my mind has just told me they are not, I’ll feel the need to immediately act like I totally didn’t care in the first place to sort of protect myself. \nI used to be very judgemental. I’m not entirely sure why I was like that but I think it was another case of rejecting other people or new ideas to act like they are somewhat below me to avoid being vulnerable.\n\nYou’re probably great and doing everything right but to the mind of a paranoid ENFJ everything is a trigger to close off and keep things superficial.\nI can’t speak for all ENFJs and my advice is probably not 100% accurate, I may be wrong. However I did recognise some of the behaviours you mentioned.\n
1	2. I can’t speak for your ex, but I would say for many and not just ENFJs , “ya” and “mmhmm” is a way people show their listening. I think it’s a real disinterest when people say nothing or barely utters a word while going through multiple topics. \n\nBeing someone who can be comfortable listening and fully engaged with everything a person is saying, sometimes I need someone to ask me a question to extract my thoughts from my head. \n\nPerhaps I’m a bit like your ex, that people cannot tell my character or personality except they I’m service oriented and care about people. So people can tell I’m genuine, which is different from your ex. \n\nENFJs don’t all fit this description. If you want to get to know an ENFJ in the future, ask about them. Bombard them with questions even if they aren’t use to talking about themselves. They need it. We get comfortable too like others. 
5	Idealizing Ni	ENFJ/32/F. It feels like my driver Fe and my co-pilot Ni compete for first place. I idealize Ni, but in the end it doesn’t seem to serve me. Anyone else struggle with this? Thanks.
1	Do you have examples as to what you mean? Like is it in social situations or while working?\n\nFor me, I feel like I've only just begun to notice it over the past couple years, whereas Fe has always been a really strong part of my personality, even when I wasn't sure what it was. Ni, as I understand it, often subconsciously picks up on patterns around you, in people, and in general. I notice it when I reach conclusions about people but I'm not sure how I've reached them. This can often be confusing, but I find that thinking about HOW I reached the conclusion I've reached can help me understand and use Ni much more.\n\nIt could be that if Ni is the co-pilot to Fe, then maybe our tertiary Se is the co-pilot to Ni. It's this sensory data gathering that helps me reach understandings with Ni, but it tends to happen in the background rather than being an active process. Again, spending time understanding the steps that lead to Ni can perhaps help you understand Ni in general. Se is how ENFJs attempt to actively make sense of and feel the world around us, so perhaps that will help you get a better grip of Ni. I hope that helps!
31	Being an extrovert is a lot more difficult and depressing than many people realize.	
12	My ENFJ husband talks about how lonely he felt 90% of his life. He always needed  roommates, to be out of his house, doing things, hanging with people, going to bars ect. His house was really just a place to sleep because he NEEDED to have interaction to feel full. \n\nAs an introvert, and INFJ, just hearing that makes me want to crawl up in a ball under covers in my home lol. It made me feel sad for extroverts. I'm so happy alone, or with just one friend I see every once in awhile. It must be hard and lonely to need to recharge as an extrovert with people, and not have your people around. 
5	I feel like this is how an Unhealthy extrovert feels. \n\nI'm a hard ENFJ, and I certainly appreciate days when I dont have to see anyone. Especially when I have things to do. 
3	Stumbled across this and it reminded me of myself lol
3	as an enfj whose best friends are introverts, this is my daily struggle. i feel comfort in knowing i’m not (virtually) alone. 
3	>I would REALLY badly want to socialize, like desperately, but also be  scared to socialize. I would sometimes get too anxious to go out and  then spend the entire rest of the night just feeling horribly angry at  myself for not going out.\n\nahhhhh yeppp I know the feeling. I do like my 1 day off a week from socializing (because usually, I plan things then) but 3-4 in a row is usually my limit with being alone before I really start feeling this and most my friends are introverts.
1	Yeeppp
1	ouch yes. but between my customer service job and the fact that I spend most of my free time at least texting my friends I'm alright.
5	Is this an enfj thing? No offense	So i have a friend/bff for 4 years and he's an enfj (tested through 16types). Im an isfj and yes we get along. The communication between us is smooth and so far we havent fought . Like a typical enfj, hes very understanding and approachable to his colleages. Moreover, when he wants to bond with me and his other friends, he would initiate a plan and i would usually follow through it.There are days where he would call me and we would chat about whatever we want through phone .\n\nThere were times where he did call me at inopportune or inconvenient times . I would immediately reject it and message him that i was busy during the time he wanted to talk to me on phone. He would tell me on messenger that he had no one to talk to and he WANTED someone to hang out with. Other than that, he would tell me all the plans for our next hangout .\nThere were times I would also return a phone call and we would talk just to hear him.\n\nthis year, we dont talk much face to face except on phone and on messenger. But what really irritates me is that he frequently calls me like 3 times a day because he wants someone to talk to or wants to discuss his next hangout. On my part, i have nothing to talk about other than to listen to his rant bout something . Yeah he would ask me how im doing and i would say im fine. Then after that he would proceed to tell me how his day went. \n\nOne time, he asked me  on fb messenger if he could phone me and it got on my nerves.I told him straightforwardly that he doesnt need to phone me if he want to tell me something because there are times im busy or i need my alone time. He said he understood my part. He told me that he couldnt type and message me because he wanted to feel the connection ( as friends) between us and express his feelings about something. Afterwards he apologized and told me to just communicate in messenger through voice chat.\n\nYesterday, i opened my fb messenger and saw he had a message for me . Guess what, he mentioned my name 8 times Lmaooo. I asked him why and he told me if he could call me on phone again because he had a duty ( hes a sales coordinator at a car company btw) . He said he had no one to talk to . I told him I was busy .\n\nThis day, he messaged me again because he had something he wanted to discuss . Yep you guess it our next hangout again. I told him this day i was busy ( household chores and looking for jobs online yep). He told me he wanted a steady flow of communication . I told him he could just message me it's not that hard and i could actually read messages. he said he would see if he could make it . I was like tf cant he type? I feel like he's entitled to call me on phone just because Im the only one who he believes available to fill up the role of a convenient friend. Im not saying he is using me. He  would usually invite me whenever he has upcoming event like parties. Dont say this is one sided when in fact i already gave him a valuable advice because i care for him as a friend. Whenever he's down i would cheer him up and he would do the same too.\n\nAnother thing is that he has friends that he usually calls best friends which is strange because a bestfriend is someone who you know for like years already and these people who he calls bestfriends are just friends .\n\nAny advice?\n\n\n\n\n
10	I’m only speaking from experience but aha I have one infj friend that I’m not really that close to who I tried to be friends with by sharing my problems... he had a similar reaction as you. I think maybe your enfj is a ted bit unhealthy right now as he is looking for people to be there for him. I was dealing with something similar but because I have infp/infj/enfp friends around me and those types seems to mind less about absorbing my need to vent and my need for communication I was okay. \n\nI think what I noticed from isfj/esfj types (from my own experience) is that you guys have a bit of a “negative” outlook on life. I don’t mean to put this in a bad way but that it acts as your defence mechanism for facing life’s problems. My 3 sf friends have optimistic moments but in general they expect pessimistic results to not set themselves up for failure? (Maybe my sf friends are just pessimistic ahaha feel free to lmk if I am wrong) and I think due to that they wonder why enfjs don’t do the same because if you don’t have so much expectations on others then you wouldn’t be hurting so badly. \n\nEnfjs want “answers” I think that’s the main thing about our type is that (especially when we are unhealthy) we overthink A WHOLE TON. We want to find out what went wrong and how we can change that. Because of this we often dwell on things that we have no control over. So, even though there’s nothing to be done there’s an uneasy feeling in us that we need to get rid of and hence we share them with the people around us in order to gain insights while at the same time feel closer and gain connection with that person. \n\nI relate to your enfj but I do not put pressure for one person to be there for me. I understand my need for that and so I have around 7/8 people that I can go to for this. Maybe your enfj is really struggling to find someone else rn... if you really can not handle it anymore, I would suggest you being honest with him and let him know that you want to be there for him but you feel like there’s not enough of your time for you to be there for him fully and if he cares for himself he should expend a little bit of his support system. \n\n(And maybe I am totally off here and he is perfectly fine but is just coming off a bit strong 😂😅 then... I don’t know aha) \n\nI hope I helped a little if anything! 
5	Definitely an unhealthy ENFJ. He doesn’t seem to understand how boundaries work and is quite clingy. Everyone needs some kind attention but this is immature and he needs to change his ways. Especially because you’ve told him how annoying it is. I don’t really have any advice but I’ve never seen an ENFJ act like this
4	To be honest it does sound like he's being very demanding and not respecting your boundaries. I had this problem with an ENFJ friend too and eventually had to stop talking to them on the phone altogether.\n\n>On my part, i have nothing to talk about other than to listen to his rant bout something . Yeah he would ask me how im doing and i would say im fine. Then after that he would proceed to tell me how his day went.\n\nThis also sounds exactly like my ENFJ friend... I started to get a bit tired of the one-sided conversations. My friend also wanted to talk on the phone instead of typing on Facebook to chat, which was difficult as I don't have a lot of energy for voice calls.\n\nI also totally relate to this feeling with my ENFJ friend:\n\n>I feel like he's entitled to call me on phone just because Im the only one who he believes available to fill up the role of a convenient friend.\n\nIt sounds to me like you need some firmer boundaries and to set limits with this person. He might get angry and upset, but it's not your fault. He probably needs to see a therapist as it doesn't sound particularly emotionally healthy.  I did read that Oprah (a famous ENFJ) calls her best friend, Gayle, four times a day on the phone though... so yeah it seems like that's just how a lot of ENFJs like to be with their closest friends.\n\nI think that these kinds of expectations might be more reasonable in a partnership but it's a lot to ask of a friend, especially if you didn't agree to this kind of frequency of contact. Personally I would only talk to someone daily on the phone if we had mutually agreed to a romantic or platonic partnership dynamic. I feel like it's unfair if someone expects to always be my number one priority but I'm not theirs.\n\nFinally I would say that if you're a woman and he's a straight or bi guy, there is a good chance he wants something romantic out of this and may not see the friendship the same way you do. I would say 95% of my single male friends have asked me out or confessed feelings at some point so don't be surprised if that occurs. I would be careful if this is the case and make your boundaries very clear.\n\n(ENFP here by the way)
2	yea sounds like this enfj is a bit unhealthy as everyone else mentioned.  This is like the worst aspects of an enfj who doesn't know boundaries.  3 calls a day is definitely overkill and I wouldn't do that with even my closest of friends.  I bug my partner on the daily, but we live together so that's to be expected.  However, the fact they are unable to respect your time means you might need to set the boundaries upfront.  ENFJs will continue to behave badly if these behaviors are reinforced or ignored.  It might be bad to burst his bubbles, but friends are there to push each other to be better people.  If you don't challenge him to be better, then he'll just keep doing what he does and you'll end up with a bunch of lost time
2	hi sorry enfp invading here !!	BUT, this is related to you guys!!\n\nI met this ENFJ recently and we've only been talking for about 2 weeks but I seriously think we get along fantastic and would totally go out with him if I had the chance. I think I'm developing feelings (which is kind of bad) because he FRIENDZONED ME. HARDCORE.\n\nI want to know if this is an ENFJ friendzone and how I can get out?!?\n\nHe talks to me about some girls who have been chatting him up and asks me how to let them down because he doesn't want to talk to them.\n\nHe told me his previous two best friends were girls!!\n\nHowever, he also says really ambiguous stuff that could be taken as flirting when we banter. ALSO, I feel like this is kind of big for me but we talk a lot (like 10-3am chats) and we never lapse in conversation. Personally that's an indication of at least close friends bordering on could be more but I'm not sure what ENFJs think!\n\nSo anyways, being me, it took a while, but I actually asked him straight out. I asked him if he was flirting with me or just being nice (already caught the feelings here). And he insisted we were just friends and basically \*shing\* cut the 'more than friends' bridge between us.\n\n:(\n\nHe did ask me earlier though if I thought girls and guys could just be friends. I told him that it was hard and I believe less in platonic relationships now than I did before because of previous experiences. (Maybe I gave him the impression that it would create a problem if it wasn't a platonic relationship?)\n\nI'm not sure. ENFJs are hard for me to read, I really can't tell because you're amazingly awesome people pleasers!\n\nLet me know what you guys think, and how can I get out of this friendzone?!?!\n\nUpdate:\n\nThank you guys so much, this is really insightful and helpful for me!\n\nI'm not against platonic relationships, if that's what it sounds like, but I tend to just have emotions more like a tornado. And also, I do realise it sounded like I was going to ask him out now, but to clarify, I don't really believe in moving to a relationship phase that fast either :)\n\nI was really just looking to see if it had any potential past friends or not, but I didn't want to ruin a good friendship if he wasn't romantically interested.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate #2:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTurns out he never friendzoned me in the first place. We just thought we friendzoned each other!! Thank you all for all your help! :))
12	What you said about platonic relationships would really rub me the wrong way. My friends are the most valuable part of my life, and all three of my best friends are of the opposite sex.\n\nIt's possible he might not have liked that from what you said, but it's also possible that he just doesn't see you that way. Continuing to press it could make him uncomfortable. I think the best thing to do is preserve your friendship since your feelings aren't *that* far along. He's still a person beyond the potential for boyfriend. 
6	I'd say distance yourself out of it.  Honestly, every time I hear someone say they are friendzoned, I get a sense they feel like they are entitled to having their feelings reciprocated.  I understand if you feel that attraction to him, but that doesn't mean he'll feel the same with you.  Your options are as follow:\n\n1. Stop expecting anything romantic and foster the friendship you have with this person.  Friendships are a lot more important in the long run than short term romance.\n\n2. Since you've made your feelings clear, you can either stay in the friendship or stop talking.  I can make a decent probability that continuing of friendship is unlikely if this choice is taken.\n\n3. Distance yourself from any further interactions to save both of you the hurt/drama that will inevitably come to fruition because a lot of people tend to wait it out and hope they'll be noticed and feelings reciprocated.\n\nENFJs know what they want and it's very apparent if they feel attracted to someone.  But we also do not like to deal with things imposed on us and any sort of insincerity.  I've been in your shoes before, and it really does suck to really like someone but to be ruled out of any chance of romance between you and your crush. \n\nBeing friends is not a bad thing and relationships themselves aren't the key to happiness.  You can hang out with him for years and be the nicest person in the world.  But that does not entitle you to any sort of reward for all that trouble.  Mostly because you're doing all those things expecting something in return, instead of actually doing them to be sincere.\n\nI hate to be super cut throat and straightforward, but looking at the other responses, I believe we mostly on the same page about this.
3	It sounds like you need to distance yourself and take some space, otherwise you're probably just going to get hurt. I would suggest setting some boundaries and talking less - e.g. if you're talking every day, bring it down to once or twice a week. If you stick around trying to change his mind you will probably end up looking like the female version of a "nice guy (TM)" - which just makes you look kind of desperate and pushy. Get on dating apps and start meeting other guys. I would also recommend this article: [Unrequited Love for a Friend? Here Are 6 Ways to Deal](https://everydayfeminism.com/2016/01/dealing-with-unrequited-love/)
1	Is he gay? 
7	What Do You Think of ENTJ’s?	I’m an ENTJ and I’m curious. \n\nTitle says it all.
7	I have an admiration for ENTJ's, though more from a distance than personally. The ENTJ ability to be a fearless leader obviously makes your type a close adjacent of my own, but sometimes ENTJ's can seem a little cold and mechanical. That extroverted rationality makes it hard for me to relate personally to most ENTJ's. Still, hypothetically speaking, if I was building a government cabinet, I'd want ENTJs in a few places.
3	Places everyone
2	I think they have great leadership and negotiation skills, and I admire their boldness to get down to business or say everything they feel, even if it's not something everyone may agree with.\n\nThe ones I've met IRL (classmates who have taken the test and identified themselves as ENTJs) tend to be really unemotional, or just don't seem to understand others' feelings in general (nonverbals, tone, etc.) aside from what they explicitly say. For example, someone I knew who was an ENTJ was romantically interested in me and I had a really hard time making it clear that I was not interested in return. I was able to ultimately distance myself from communication, and he ended up getting a girlfriend, but the clear "hints" I'd intentionally dropped while he did like me hadn't done anything to discourage him.\n\nBut I think they can have really good skillsets and there are a lot of good things about their abilities, they just aren't as emotionally "there" as I would like sometimes haha
1	tbh I haven't met one
1	As someone who straddles the line between ENFJ and ENTJ, I like them! (usually.  some can be a little too annoying or cocky)
1	My sister is one, and I admire her objectivity and confidence. Her ability to separate emotion from any task, from work to romance, allows her to make major decisions objectively and with ease. She's goal oriented, which I think being an ENFJ allows me to appreciate. She tends to discount other people's perspectives and feelings, however, which I find to be incredibly off-putting.\n\nIn all, my experience with an ENTJ is one of admiration. However, that level of objectivity scares the crap out of me.
0	I like the idea of them. The willpower and strength they possess, the high EQ which is higher than INFJs (surprise) and adorable soft side they have when it comes to romantic relationships.  Unfortunately, I do not have enough experiences with them to give you a realistic answer. 
11	ENFJ Careers	Hi again!! I really struggle with this ig but what careers to fellow ENFJ's have? I always really wanted to help people or society as a whole, but not really sure what career would be right? Anyways I have been thinking of pediatrics, or environmental engineering, any other suggestions? What are your jobs? ty!  💖  
5	My main passion is making music, but I'm currently in college for a Film/Broadcasting degree! I love making videos and editing and whatnot 👌
4	I started Physician Assistant school a month ago so I’ll be doing that
3	Someone asked the same question a while back and it was a very interesting read! Link below \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/enfj/comments/8mijet/enfj_suitable_careers/?st=JKENBUGU&sh=cf64d65e\n
3	I work in outside sales. I have been in sales for over 10 years. I don't love it, but because I am good with people and am pretty analytical I am good at sales. It's not really a cold call type position though. I would suck at that, but it's more of a key account relationship building sales role and I manage that well. \n\nIf I had to start all over though, I would probably go into a healthcare field, humanitarian work, or a national park conservationist.
3	I’m a psychology major with a minor in legal studies! Either capital hill or a private practice for me.
3	Teachers, mentors, coaches, customer service type jobs, sales even stuff like pharmaceutical sales or working selling financial products.\n\nENFJ's also have the potential to be the best leaders IMO, so positions like project leader or managers are also potential natural fits. 
2	Not ENFJ but my best friend is and he's a lawyer and mediator. Family law drains him though so he tries to stick with mediation full-time. 
2	I work at a start-up using Blockchain to empower people to invest in infrastructure that can provide life security. I work as a networker and business developer. It's the perfect combination of my analytical and social skills, plus we only invest in sustainable infrastructure so we actively try to better the world every day :)
2	I teach English!
2	I’m a midwife! I think it’s the perfect job for an ENFJ :) 
2	I'm going to school to become a clinical mental health counselor!
2	[I](https://80000hours.org) searched extensively for this, because I didn't want to spend a huge chunk of my life doing something I didn't like. Here: 80000hours.org Look for jobs with work that emphasize your first and second functions or first and third (depending on whether you prefer your second over your third or third over second). That's the one thing the guide doesn't tell you. They DO mention personality, though.\n\nAlso, there's a ton of jobs that aren't being filled, and they pay super well in comparison to costs due to such a severe lack of competition.\n\nI'm an INTP by the way.
2	I also really want to help people!!  I'm also into medical stuff, so I was thinking about getting into biomedical engineering or perhaps psychiatry.
2	environmental engineering that's what i'm studying right now!! :)
2	I work in a museum where I get to teach kids about science and art. :)\n\nWhen I'm not doing that, I cook and serve at a vegan/veggie restaurant. (I love cooking!)\n\nAnd when I'm not doing that, I freelance graphic design and illustration. (What I actually went to school for, lmao.)\n\nArt has always been important to me, but I really enjoy teaching and sharing with others as a vocation. Science is a close second passion. However... If I could go back to school or do it all again, I would either go for therapy or entomology.\n\nedit: rephrasing
2	I'm about to go into the Peace Corps to do Community Development so I guess you could say I'm very ENFJish and hope to work in politics one day.
2	Politics, medicine, advocacy & law, teaching
1	[deleted]
1	High school math teacher 
1	I started out as a computer nerd in my youth and followed with a CS degree, being very sport I also like to coach people. So next ahead for me is that I want to leave office work and work directly as a teacher or full time-coach. We'll see maybe I become an entrepreneur! ENFJ!
6	How many friends do you have?	I’m pretty curious about this since ENFJs are known for their wide array of social circles. So question for you ENFJs: \n\n• How many friends do you have? \n\n• Is it obvious when someone is trying to only have friends to overcompensate for their loneliness? 
3	3 peeps i connect on the regular. 5 people I talk to erry now and then and I'll leave 2 extra that I talk to once in a blue moon but time freezes when we don't hang out and we pick up where we left off once we do hang out.\n\nand i think anything is obvious if someone is desperate enough.
3	I would say 4 very close friends. These are the ones I have great times with but have also been vulnerable with about matter in life and such.\n\nI have 3 other friends where we hang out, get food, play video games, and just laugh. I love these guys because they keep life very simple and it keeps me in that world too. \n\nThere are other friends whom I see often, sometimes hang with everyday even but they’re not on that same goofy/emotional/laughter level as the others. Still grateful to have some ones I can really be close with
1	a lot ig?\n\nNot really because I usually talk to them first!
1	I have many friends but 5 really close ones.
1	3 lifelong childhood friends. Many online pals and real life friendly acquaintances/previous classmates 
1	1000+. I've a lot of friends (local and overseas) but best buddy are around 50. It maybe obvious but I don't mind. These people are usually fun seeker and would do crazy stuff with me to compensate that, which is cool
1	I have lots of friends who feel as though they are close with me! In reality I have about 3 close friends who are all female (I am a male)
1	I have 1 best friend of 14 years, but I have a lot of friends that I talk to on a daily basis. Some I’ve never met in person, but met through our online business. Also have a lot of “acquaintances”. Being a Gemini ENFJ definitely means I have a big social circle. 
1	6 super close friends (talk to daily), 4 close friends (semi-daily) and about 15 other friends.
1	I have 5 good friends who I speak to every day pretty much. Of these, 1 is my best friend who knows everything on my mind and all of my deep stuff. One is probably almost on this level but it will take time to get there. The other three are nice people who I share some things with but not as much as my best friends, however I spend a lot of time with them and talk to them often.
1	2 very close ones. Lots of aquaintances. Lots of people I pretend to be friends with in order to get what I want. 
14	Hey!!!	I took this test last night that told me I’m ENFJ!! This is pretty cool ig! Anyways have a good night love y’all! 💖🌙
2	Good night :)
2	[deleted]
5	Hey y'all ENFJs, what do you think of all the 16 types?	Maybe I should add a little disclaimer:\n- this post is just for me to understand ENFJs' perspective, not wanting to see anyone bashed, but of course everyone has their likes and dislikes, and i'm just trying to see how ENFJs relate to everyone, positives and negatives alike, or just positives if you would really like to avoid negativity, that's cool too\n- also, no pressure to speak on behalf of all ENFJs, just spit what you got, I'll take in as much as possible what every fellow here says, and I take grains of salt\n- and of course we are so much more than our types, but if we are all totally different from each other, we wouldn't be able to understand each other at all, which isn't the case, so we all have some similarities, and there is therefore some patterns of which group of people do more/less of what, what I'm saying is that I'm not belittling anyone's individuality (we are all equally little *hahaha*), so no need to be shy about what you might have to say about each type\n- if you don't buy into this whole MBTI thing at least a bit.... Why are you even on this sub?!?\n\nI hope I make myself clear enough, ENFJs seem to me often overly considerate/PC haha, not a terrible thing though :)
3	Idk really!! Everyone is really awesome and I don’t think I can say otherwise based on the score they got on a test!!
3	ESTJ - Super hard workers, I was lab partners with one and I can say without a doubt she was one of the people who've reciprocated my effort in group projects most out of my 4 years of college. They seem to always go after what they want and while I feel like they can have a hard time lightening up sometimes, their determination is really respectable. The other definite ESTJ I know IRL (aside from aforementioned lab partner) has a really dry, hilarious sense of humor WHEN he manages to loosen up and relax haha.\n\nESFJ - They seem so socially confident, outgoing, and like friends to everyone. From the couple I have met IRL, they do have a bit of a tendency to gossip, but idk for sure if that represents everyone of the type. Still, I don't feel like they (usually) do it for bad/manipulative purposes, but I guess just to have something to talk about since they're so bubbly and interested in how/what people are doing.\n\nISTJ - Really hardworking like ESTJ. Skeptical at times (example: classmate of mine who I told to take the MBTI and who got ISTJ told me right after "this test seems like pseudoscience!" and tended to want a lot of explanations for EVERYTHING we discussed in class or even outside of it) but if you give them the evidence/background they need for a topic of discussion, they'll get really curious and engaged in the conversation, which is nice.\n\nISFJ - Can be pretty quiet, but warm up once you find something they enjoy to bring up in conversation. They don't seem that easily offended either and seem to enjoy/appreciate different senses of humor even if they don't go out there and be the ultimate jokesters themselves haha.\n\nESTP - don't know anyone IRL who's said this is their type for sure, so I don't feel comfortable making judgments just based on online interactions or more vague perceptions.\n\nESFP - same as above\n\nISFP - same as above\n\nENFP - same as above\n\nENTP - same as above\n\nINTP - same as above\n\nISTP - EXTREMELY funny, really chill, down for anything, good at hands-on tasks. They sometimes aren't the best at giving words of reassurance or getting really emotional themselves, but they definitely don't seem judgmental or harsh towards others when they're expressing their emotions. They make me feel the least judged of all types, personally.\n\nENFJ - not commenting on my type lol\n\nINFP - Loyal, good hearts and good heads on their shoulders. Sometimes you have to give them a nudge in a certain direction to get them to do something (like a friend of mine is this type and I'm almost always the one to say "hey wanna hang out"), but they're good people.\n\nINFJ - Really creative (two I know IRL are poets and have been published multiple times). Like ISFJ, can be hard to get to open up, but they seem to be really intelligent and I respect how much deep thought I feel like they put into things.\n\nENTJ - Sometimes they struggle with understanding other people's emotions or anything that isn't explicitly stated about interpersonal relationships IMHO, but they have great understandings of organizational structures, complex systems, anything like that. 10/10 leadership skills.\n\nINTJ - Really hardworking, those I've met IRL aren't "heartless" or dictatorial like the stereotype seems to be. They aren't super-emotional but can be fun to talk about academic/school-based topics with due to the way their minds work. They're good at holding objective conversations.
2	I’m not gonna describe my general impression of the types because then I’d sort of just end up rewriting their profile, haha. I’ll try and focus on the dynamic I have with those of each type who I know as I feel that would be more useful. These are each based on a person of the type whom I know.\n\nINTJ: seemed very quiet at first and admittedly I never got to know them at first. An extremely intelligent, introspective individual who does things in a logical way and knows how to achieve things, always there to provide me with advice to get myself together as I have poor organisation. DOES have feelings that they eventually reveal when very close to you, and when they do it feels very rewarding! Only point of disagreement is that I always want to go out however INTJ will never leave the house to hang out with me hahaha. (The type of my best friend, with whom I get on very well.)\n\nINTP: I also get on well with them. They seem more chilled out and less serious than INTJ, with some warmth to their character. I like their reserved yet sincere approach and they seem to respond well to me as a person.\n\nENTP: Rather fun people to talk to. Also intelligent. Can be VERY confident in themselves and their arguments but sometimes unfortunately to the point they are cocky and look down on those who disagree so different to an ENFJ there. However I mostly agree with my ENTP friend and we share many perspectives. A feelings- related conversation is rare so my ENFJ self sometimes feels a little less connected.\n\nENTJ: unfortunately only know an unhealthy one I think and thought she was a little bit harsh and judgemental. I’m sure most entjs are great though.\n\nESTJ: - don’t know any\nISTJ: - don’t know any\n\nESFJ: she is fun to be around but can be a little bit fake at times so I keep our friendship superficial too. \n\nISFJ: not to sound patronising but I’d say cute! Very caring loving people who love to chat about their day and tell stories which I love to listen to. Open to hearing advice which makes the unofficial-therapist ENFJ happy. Sometimes easily offended and negative.as someone who is generally optimistic, this sometimes annoys me.\n\nINFP: absolutely love them, get on very well with them. We could talk for ages. They are into the long deep conversations about relationships and feelings that I am so conversations come easily.\nINFJ: same thing applies really. We share many ways of seeing things. \nENFJ: well that’s me\n\nENFP: I like these guys a lot too. Always down to do something fun and very chilled out and bubbly. We get on well. \n\nESFP: super fun and super nice individuals. I like having them round as it’s never boring when they are. Quite genuine in my experience too. But the one I know often struggles to ever be serious though I like a serious deep conversation. We get on well though. \n\nISFP: interesting person whose artsiness I truly admire. seems to feel things very deeply and take a while to open up. I sometimes don’t know what to say in conversation as they are so reserved and seem to have a lot going on inside that they don’t express outwardly.\n\nESTP: fun to be around but sometimes I can’t really keep up or relate to them. My Se isn’t particularly strong so I prefer to sit down in one place whilst these guys have something new and crazy to do every day.\n\nISTP: seemed almost completely asocial at first but is actually quite nice. Straight forward and I never feel judged around them. We are visibly polar opposites but can get on. Do not start talking about feelings!!\n\n
1	It definitely adds an interesting perspective to dating! I’ve found that when pursuing a girl the question of their MBTI type comes up a lot! According to the test we are most compatible with INFP’s. Quite introspective females is what I’m attracted to anyway!
0	I don’t put much stock into these types. They’re a cut above horoscopes to me. Can seem accurate but humans are complex and capable of feeling, acting, and thinking in any number of ways.
5	Music and personality data gathering (5 minute survey)	Hello all, if you are interested, I created a survey regarding Mbti type and music preferences. It's just for fun, but I am curious to see the results. I personally don't expect to see a huge difference between types, but who knows! It'll only take a few minutes, so please check it out.\n\nI will be posting results after all the data has been compiled.\nhttps://goo.gl/forms/wgMY0z9LvWmN0NY23\n\n***Edit: I will be closing the test to do data stuff at 2pm CT on Sunday, August 5. Sorry if you didn't get it a chance to take the test. Look for the results post in a day or two.***
1	Well apparently systematic genres, but I can't even find Lo-Fi.\n\nJust saying. 
29	Curb Your Machiavellianism	ENFJs are pretty adept at social situations, and personally I find myself acting like a 'chameleon' of sorts. When I was younger it often meant that I was easily swayed by peers and other people to 'fit in,' but as I've gotten older my identity has started to become more solid, and I've been able to take better advantage of the Fe function.\n\nThe result is I don't find it difficult to make friends, but sometimes I get the urge to act in an unethical/Machiavellian ways if I believe that it is the best way to achieve a goal (ex. flattery to get a promotion). I understand that this behavior is wrong and I try to suppress it, or at the very least, redirect it to the goal of helping others, but even then, I still show shades of being Machiavellian (ex. 'white lies' to someone who is emotionally fragile, etc.).\n\nRecently I've withdrawn because I feel disingenuous when talking to people. I've also withdrawn because I find the prospect of influencing (manipulating?) another person towards a wrong path/decision terrifying and unethical. I've begun to work on my core values first so I can be more authentic and honest to both myself and others.\n\nDo other ENFJs have this experience? How do you deal with it?
8	I agree and relate with everything you said. I feel like the charm and chameleon ability has made it easy for me to get along with anyone but I have to reflect on my own values.\n\nA lot of times when I have conversations where I feel like I’m using Fe to a high amount, I’ll walk away after the conversation and ask myself questions. \n\nWho was the person I talked to? Did I truly care to talk to them? What kind of image am I trying to show to that person? Am I seeking something from them?\n\nIt’s a difficult thing to not talk to people who may want to talk to me because I was acting super nice and all to them for a while now. But now I try to be more self aware even in conversations so I don’t force anything and I can still know who I am, rather than who I’m trying to be
4	As an EIE (ENFj) - My social situations tend to be a bit flashy and shy at the same time. I'm the kind of person who isn't "Literally" consistent - but the methodology and connections behind the way I act has always seemed sort of more "real" to me, and how they interact with others. They are authentic - because they are me, because I am honest, and because I have a goal outlined. Without a goal, I would shape things for the fun of it and transform relationships and social boundaries without benefit. \n\nWe would both fall into love with the connections that I make between me and the world. The reality and character that I create are defined by the convictions held between me and the world's zones of influence. It's a choice to do positive things - you'll be a lot happier with a few long-term friends than a million acquaintances who you share brief smiles and light small talk with. 
2	Definitely a huge standard problem/growing pain for our type. As you get more comfortable in your own skin and increase your variety of experience (seek out new experiences and interactions) to break some of your dependency on the current 'someones' in your life, I think this will naturally reduces over time. As long as you aren't feeding the beast (telling yourself this mach approach is 'power'). Stay away from the 48 Laws of Power advocates, that path only looks like power to those who are unfamiliar with building real, trusting human connections.\n\nI haven't finished it yet, but I'm currently reading the book 'Ask Powerful Questions: Create Conversations that Matter' which dives into this and similar issues. My main takeaway (so far) is to remain present in the moment by allowing the internal 'source' of your engagement questions to be your natural curiosity. E.g. If you go on a date, you should focus on thoughts in the realm of 'man, this is going to be great, I love getting to know people and seeing how they work. No matter the outcome, I'll have a greater appreciation for them and expand my knowledge of the human condition.' instead of 'I want this to end X way' (future focused) or 'I'm nervous because in the past this has gone X way' (past focused).
2	Yeah, I get this as well. In the past, I would force myself to act more 'morally' and not as willing to be influential like you are now.\n\nMore recently, I've been teaching myself to care less about what is morally correct since realising that a major flaw of mine was being so giving it was damaging myself, and as a result I'm far more inclined to use past generosity and 'selfless' acts to influence the behaviour of the people around me. It's not like I'm guilting people into sleeping with me, just getting a fair deal or one slightly favoring me when I used to accept a loss at every deal I made.\n\nI'm still an ENFJ, I just account for something I would consider a weakness of my personality. I'd say give the Machiavellian way of thinking a try and see if it's something you would enjoy instead of just writing it off as immoral
1	This seems similar to my experience of my girlfriend and what she describes about her actions.
8	I think my dog is an ENFJ.	7 year old mutt mix. Runt of her litter and scared of most things but once you gain her trust she’s a fearless friend. \n\nStupid post I know 
3	Great post. Good doge, Much loyal.\n\nI think my pet rock is an INTJ.
1	Infp or enfj	So I took one test and it said infp. I took a different test and got enfj. I’m very familiar with infp‘s and what they are like because I go on that sub a lot. I don’t know much about enfj’s though. Are the two pretty similar? How do I know which one I am? 
4	Ditch the tests.  Too subjective and the questions are terrible, and usually type based on the letter dichotomies (I/E, N/S, etc) when they should be typing the *cognitive functions*\n\nThe two are shadow types.  This means that their functions are the reverse of eachothers:\n\nINFP: Fi, Ne, Si, Te \nENFJ: Fe, Ni, Se, Ti\n\nShadow pairs are similar but also complete opposites.\n\nINFP: With Fi-Ne, they will be aware of all of the immense possibilities in life (Ne) and it will take them a while to make a decision on something big until their internal values & feelings about things assert themselves (Fi).  So the INFP desires self understanding of what makes them unique and what their internal values are so that they can narrow down all the Ne possibilities.  Their inferior Te makes them either neglect or not value leadership, and they may not take control when they should (or, if they are stressed, take control when they *shouldnt*).  So their conflict is the imbalance between Fi values and identity VS. Te rational control of the tribe.  Their Te will kick in when they are stressed or angry, making them explode and seem very irrationally controlling.  The INFP's blindspot is Se (the reverse of their tertiary function) which makes it difficult to take action and be spontaneous in the moment, and be aware of the moment.\n\n ENFJ:  With Fe-Ni, the ENFJ is one of the most goal oriented types along with ENTJ's.  They reeeeaallly desire progression & achievement, in testing their abilities.  My ENFJ friend pretty much measures his wellbeing completely through achievement.  Ni has a more specific vision of the future than the INFP's Ne, and its going towards trying to aid Fe which essentially wants to understand its social role and try to benefit the social domain in some way, and achieve a solidarity based on shared value and vision.  The ENFJ's inferior function is Ti.  The strain between dominant Fe and inferior Ti will create problems such as self doubt (doubting ones own system of logic, doubting ones own abilities) and some unhealthy ENFJ's may define themselves through their relations to others & social role too much.  They also may help others too much and forget their own needs.  When their stressed, they seem to just go into a depressive mode of self doubt and existential despair.  The ENFJ's blindspot is Si.  Si partly deals with comfort and stability, which is something that seems irrelevant to the goals of the ENFJ.  This can be good, as it gives them their intense perseverance, but sometimes they need to know when to just let themselves chill out and recharge.
0	Why is it important? Everyone exists on a spectrum. Read about both and take to yourself the stuff that you identify with. Putting yourself in a folder is not necessary.
13	New here and I’ve got a question.	I’m loving this community so far, it’s nice that others feel things so closely to how I do. My question is; how many of you have faced addiction, self harm or overall self destructive tendencies? I have and continue to struggle with all and I was wondering how common that is with ENFJ’s. 
12	I have found that when I don’t feel like I have a life “purpose,” I fall into some very unhealthy habits. The shitty thing was that I knew how destructive my behaviors were, but I had such a negative self image that I convinced myself that I deserved to be destroyed. \nFinally after a few years, I’ve finally recognized this trend, and realized how I need to care for myself the way I care for others. 
15	I’ve dealt w/ self-destructive tendencies. They’ve mostly stemmed from a lack of validation and feeling that I wasn’t good enough. Time and good company are the best healers but I am still working on it
4	Hi! Fellow enfj here. \nI too like many here have dealt with depression, anxiety, and self destructiveness. For me personally, I struggle with PTSD so that has tied into a lot of my self destructive tendencies. I believe stress disorders have a lot to do with depression. I don’t cut or anything... I self mutilate myself though. I actually tear and pick at my skin and have many scars all over my fingers, mouth, toes, face, etc. I also have struggled with suicidal thoughts and body image issues. It can happen to any type! Don’t feel alone. \n\nI’ve heard that most types, when stressed fall into a situation where they begin using their weakest function. For ENFJ’s, this is Ti (introverted thinking). ENFJ’s will no longer focus on tending to the emotions of others, but rather become much more analytical than usual (which since this is their weakest function, they won’t be able to control it very well). They will begin to critique the details of everything and may ponder a thought for a while before they attempt to speak. They will uncharacteristically withdraw from others, feeling very drained by the presence of too many people. ENFJ’s normally are very focused on how they affect others, but under stress they may become overly critical. They can stop attempting to make contact and no longer feel a desire to organize social events. Their strong focus on facts and logic may be skewed and overly critical. 
6	Currently am, yes. I’m better at improving others and focusing on others than myself, which leads me to find it harder to stop certain things I want to stop as they are destructive or whatever 
3	Not addiction or self-harm, but I definitely have struggled with really low self-esteem and had issues with body dysmorphia / maintaining a healthy weight in high school. Even though I've since been able to overcome that particular issue (college student now), I still don't think of myself that highly at times, and my need to put others above myself can sometimes inadvertently throw my own needs to the side.
5	I think all of the socially-focused personality types have some of this. People just aren't dependable, so eventually you self-medicate or fall into bad suicidal idealization patterns. I think therapy is also potentially always a great option for ENFJ - even if you get a bad fit and need to try again, more social about deep content is a net positive for our type (IMO). Called yesterday to set up my first appointment to treat my social anxiety - wish ya'll luck on your own mental journeys!
2	Dearest friend. I’ve found my self destructive tendencies come in bursts. As ENFJ’s we typically do everything in waves/burst etc. Whether it be my depression or just all consuming lust it’s like a wave and then passes. The question is how much destruction and collateral damage do I cause myself during the wave\nEdit: I’m a fairly happy person too, just being the anchor and beacon for so many people can be socially draining 
3	I've no idea if it's common or not (and I imagine it'll be hard to find out, as most the people that reply will be ENFJs that have faced those issues 😅), but I've struggled with self harm and unhealthy coping mechanisms (alcohol/casual sex for validation) on and off
1	I'm an addictive personality and It's usually an all or nothing thing. It's even like that quitting, ironically. 
1	Have faced/currently facing all the above. I wish I had time to see a counselor but I don’t, so I’m just trying to limit all substances to once a week, or ultimately never. Trying to add in meditation and yoga daily to take care of myself, so I can more effectively be there for others! If you have time, I would recommend a good counselor and trying to add in one healthy behavior at a time!

4	If someone is unpopular, do you not really like them due to your Fe?	Since Fe cares about being liked, when you encounter someone who is unliked, aren’t you turned off/pity that person? 
16	No, not at all. I enjoy being liked by others and feeling accepted, but I'm not going to base my opinion of someone else on if they're "popular" or not. I might feel sorry for them if they're really nice but friendless, like "wow I can't believe this person doesn't have more people who care for them," but if anything that encourages me to be their friend even more and fulfill that need haha
12	I dont care at all if someone is unpopular, unless they are unpopular due to being an asshole.
6	I became friends with one of my best friends because I saw she would stand alone in the playground during lunch. I saw her outside of school one day and told her she should hang with me and my friends the next day at school. I met my second best friend 2 years later in 5th grade because she was new and didn't have any friends on the first day of school. They both stood beside me at my wedding last year. So long story short, I specifically looked for you if you were unpopular lol.
4	extra chance to befriend someone
7	My experience in school was quite the opposite. I know I've read somewhere before that ENFJ often have a problem with authority and authority figures, and 'popular' often registered as this in my head. I typically gravitated towards those whom didn't have any or many friends, and pulled them together into a crew. Only exception is as others have stated - when their unpopular because they're rude, loud, obnoxious, or a combination of these traits. 
3	Usually if someone isn't liked and they're not an upfront asshole/immediately recognizable as someone I won't enjoy talking to, I always make it a point to talk to them and see how they are doing. Some people are really cool but often get ostracized or whatever the case may be because of preexisting differences in communication, upbringing, race, gender, etc.\n\nIt's pretty vain to befriend people based on their social standings with everyone else. I judge them based on their actions as I perceive them, and let them make their impressions on me, rather than everyone else. If you're just feeding the social hierarchy to better your own position, you don't stand for anything or anyone and you make life worse for everyone overall really, but especially that person you've now chosen to alienate alongside the others.\n\n Those are the people I try to befriend the most personally, more than anything so that if they have problems I can help them out before it festers and you end up with one less because no one knew anything was going on.\n\nIt's a little extreme of a reason, but extreme specific rules exist 99% of the time because the extreme specifically happened. Everyone needs a friend.
3	Absolutely not. I like to find out for myself what someone is like before deciding if I like them. 
4	No way that has nothing to do with FE
1	I didn’t say dislike. It’s harder to stay upbeat around them 
1	My younger brother is an ENFJ and this is something he might do. He's slowly learning that it's more valuable to be himself than liked by other people. \n\nMy gf on the other hand would be the type to be friends with unpopular people. 
1	Is it the Fe or is it the Se?
1	Sometimes it's the person who's authentically all alone who shares the brightest smile. I'm friends with everyone regardless of affinity - but only as much as it's a positive relationship for both parties. 
1	I am very observant and empathetic so I usually help them feel included or valued
1	Unpopularity of a person doesn't really matter that much. The person's genuine character does. If the person is unpopular because they are toxic or extremely hard to communicate with then, naturally I won't like them as much, but I would have to find out myself first. Although, other times, I naturally gravitate to people who don't have a lot of popularity because I want to know more about them away from the "spotlight" and I believe it's to understand different perspectives.
1	Dude you are missing the point, I don't care whether others are popular or not, it has nothing to do with how I like them. as long as I am popular I'm good ;D
0	Yeah when someone is unpopular I usually try not to interact with them. Idk what it is and I feel bad for doing it. It’s like my energy is drained when I’m around these “unpopular” people. In my experience they always end up being really weird or super awkward and don’t pick up social cues. Idk that’s just me.

I'm really good at making plans , except those plans are constantly reworked every minute of the day. \nI've learnt early on that Im not a natural self starter when it comes to tackling down tasks. I did notice that when friends tell me to get  on with it , I actually do. \n\nSo since I'm starting a new chapter , and I know what I know thought I'd ask . \n\nI can create my schedule and what I want to achieve daily or weekly basis , think where you'd come in handy is kind of checking on me couple of minutes , daily or every other day. You know some positive vibes and some orders. \n\nEdit: M25London
3	Invest in what brings passion to your heart. If you find content that alligns with your vision, lean into that. It is hard to put feelers out into the world without sounding slightly creepy. The roughest lesson I have learned in the last three months is "No one gives a shi" That is a really tough pill to swallow as an ENFJ
2	Perhaps you're more interested in someone who values Te & Si. This post seems to be aimed towards comfort & productivity with plans that tend to not be followed through upon (Although wishful thinking, and unclenching idealism). Unfortunately, while I do have friends and I do keep up with them, I don't really have any desires or aspirations to follow through on someone I don't really know in a business sense. 
1	When you find that thing you love it will give you energy to grow the business/brand you’re looking to do and you’ll naturally be able to keep it going :) You’ll know when it’s the right choice because your heart will light up. It takes time to find, but before running headfirst into the first self-business you think of, I’d say really give it some time and thought, imagining how it could grow, what your routine would be like, etc. and don’t be stuck on your first idea, one idea can flow into another and come out better than what you originally started with, it’s a bit scary of a process, but I think that’ll really help, it has in my experience. I’m super excited for your adventure :) 
1	Neato! Excited for you!!
6	Advice for a confused ENFJ	Hi People,\n\n  \nFirst and foremost really glad to have found this subbreddit. I have been reading a lot of the previous post and through that I have been learning about how what I am going through is a similar experience other's also feel.   \n\n\nRecently I have just broken up with my girlfriend, and I am still feeling out my emotions. I can't help, but also feel like I did something wrong to turn the relationship sour and that I could have done something to prevent it from ending. To begin with she was an ISTJ personality type, but I don't really use that as a final criteria for liking someone. Our core values we held dear were the same and our goals for a relationship were the same as well. In the beginning it was great she was getting to know me, she was receptive to what I wanted to know about her and things were progressing well. Even early on she told me about some of the insecurities she had about going forward and about herself, and I told her I would accept her which I did. Fast forward a bit I started to notice she would not show much affection to me, but knowing her the small things she did for me like meet me were her ways of showing it and I focused on those things to keep me grounded. After that I noticed how our messages and conversations would get shorter and less about  us and the relationship and more about things happening in general about our daily life. Tbh I did not mind those conversation's, but I would put more of my own personal feelings when describing my daily activities and how it made me feel and connected it with other random thoughts. Getting to know her more she was never the type to tell me what she was feeling or tell me what was on her mind, but advised me to ask because she "didn't mind".  Recently work was rough and I slipped into a bad head space which I explained and described to her. She diverted the conversation really obviously and brushed it off, not trying to empathize with me. That made me really sad since when she did the same thing to me and I welcomed her, but this felt like she put up a wall between me and her. This was probably wrong of me but I told her that I felt she was shielding herself from me and that I understand what I just burdened her with was wrong, but she should feel no fear in telling me anything of that nature because I would be there for her. She again built a wall from that and told me that she wasn't afraid of sharing things with me, but that it was more for her comfort to help herself going forward so it's not like she was doing it intentionally to hurt me. That's when we talked and she came to the conclusion that her past baggage was something she actually still needs to work on and is not ready to be committed again yet. I understood where she was coming from having heard a little about her baggage and I care for her that I want her to be happy and comfortable so we ended it mutually.   \n\n\nWhat I am struggling with is   \n1: That people with common core values I would have thought could work things out? But clearly it didn't work for us.  \n\n2: I know I should move on, but at the same time it feels like I should have been a better person and can make it work if we get back together, should I ever contact her again.  \n3:Did she truly like me? In the beginning yes, but towards the end the vibe started to get more clouded.  \n\n\nIn the end I did grow from this relationship and definitely have to mature more as a person, so I hold no ill will to this person. She made me realize some faults I have and that I still have a lot more work to do as a person. Any opinions or advice would be appreciated! 
3	It’s hard when a relationship ends and it sounds like you did everything you could to be a supportive, empathetic and understanding partner. However no matter how hard you try with someone sometimes it isn’t meant to be and that isn’t either of your fault.\n\nSince the breakup is recent I am assuming you need to give yourself time to reflect on the relationship and also reflect on what it taught you about your needs in a relationship. Most ENFJs I know, and myself included have a hard time letting go at first when it’s so fresh but you really need to take this time for yourself and comb through your feelings. Once away from your partner their feelings and needs can be shaken off and yours will come through clearer.\n\nI think ENFJs find breakups difficult because we consciously strive to be an awesome friend, an awesome partner etc because we are so relationship focused. We also beat ourselves up when these fall apart because we rarely neglect these relationships. Some people just grow apart naturally.\n\nI also find ENFJs hang on to a relationship far past the expiry date because of this fear of failure and tendency to blame themselves. \n\nHang in there, get out with your friends and try to find time to vent your feelings either socially or creatively (I wrote a lot of poetry lol). 
3	Can I ask, have you ever or do you currently see a therapist or councilor or anyone of that stripe? From my perspective (which is obviously extremely limited, so grain of salt), it feels like you're falling for a pretty common pitfall for ENFJ types - a potent expectation that what those services offer should be a constant part of a relationship (that you should get therapy from your partner, and vice-versa). \n\nIn my experience, this is a burden you're placing on your relationship. There's a fine line between being a conduit of positive, supportive energy for your partner (and those around you), and the incessant neediness to both be helpful and be helped at every moment in a relationship. The later can be excusing and intrusive, and lead to unhealthy codependency. \n\nThink of it like you're healing a very old wound. You need to remove the bandage and clean it, but on the day to day, you need to learn to not pick at it. Even though picking at it feels really good. Even in a scenario where your partner is also ENFJ, or at least matches your 'pick at it' desire, this (IMO) won't be the path to the ideal supportive relationship you're looking for.   \n\nI think we all have anecdotal experiences where we've offered the therapist role, and were able to help another lost soul, and then become addicted to that feel, and we think 'this is what love looks like'. But this is just one small facet. I think in a relationship, it's better to focus on developing a comfortable groove with each other. Trust comes from subtle, supportive living, not constant digging. \n\nThe best way to get over this is actual therapy, as it offers the variety of experience necessary to become comfortable enough with yourself to no longer 'need' these aspects from your partner, while having the social tool set necessary to let them know you 'want' to offer support of this stripe, when they're ready and they need them.
6	What are your interests/hobbies?	I was wondering about everyone's interests and hobbies!  I have read that a lot of ENFJs enjoy things like gourmet cooking, hosting parties and events, the outdoors, social clubs, and the arts!  \n\nFellow ENFJs, what are your interests and hobbies?
9	Personally, I enjoy gourmet cooking, non-fiction literature, music, theater, the outdoors, event planning, and hanging with friends.  I prefer to be out and about and learning new things than just chilling at home!  
6	listening to music\n\nreading\n\nwriting\n\nhanging out with friends\n\nwatching sports\n\ncrafts (knitting, crocheting - I'm like an old lady lol)\n\noutdoors (hiking, canoeing, fishing)
3	- Playing drums/piano\n- Listening to music\n- Audio/video editing \n- Language learning\n- Watching travel videos \n- Anything with friends\n
3	Exercise, bouldering/ indoor rock climbing, and video games. The last is just for kicks, but if I go a week without the first two I start to lose it. Not a gym junkie or meat head by any means, but I just need to be active.
3	Powerlifting  \n\nBaking  \n\nPeople-watching  \n\nCoffee  \n\nGuitar  \n\nReading inspirational books
3	😭 pretty much what you just listed but not so much the arts...\n\nOther than that I'm into psychology, van life, self improvement, taxidermy, weed, and skin care. 
3	Dungeons and Dragons, board games, nonfiction books, traveling. Despite being enfj in every other part of my life, I hate going to parties, but I do love going outdoors with groups!

8	A Question for my fellow ENFJ's...	Do you also struggle with feelings of inadequacy in all if not most aspects of your life? (School, Work, Friends, Etc) Do you believe this is due to our personality type? I have felt this way since childhood despite constant reassurance from family and friends that I'm really doing okay, but never feel like I am and am always behind this or that person in life.
8	I feel like that in most parts of my life, school-wise I've worked ahead a lot and accomplished enough that I feel comfortable with it, but I beat myself up a lot about other things, like my luck in the area of relationships, or how many friends I have compared to other people and how our friendships are going.
8	Not for everything but definitely in regards to academics, looks, and relationships. It really sucks because I know that I have my own talents and gifts but I always have a desire to be the best I can be. If I am lacking in one thing, it gives me a fluctuating self-esteem but I'm always trying to do better
7	Yes, I've always felt this way since I was a kid. Like I need to prove myself. I'm very self motivated and ambitious, but I think it stems from feeling like I'm not good enough, that I need to work harder.\n\n I also work in a creative field, so it makes me even more vulnerable and self critical.
6	I read that ENFJ's are easily caught up in the world of ideas  and possibilities. It's what can make them very creative and talented at integrating different subjects.\nAs an ENFJ, I've often found myself exploring idealism at the expense of pragmatism.\nThe result has often been a study in contrasts and comparisons between expectations and reality. \n\nI've accepted that I will never measure up to the idealized version of myself  because it is a figment of an imagination unbounded by the laws of Nature.\n\nIn truth, I've realized I need something greater than myself in order to focus the creative well within. (Philosophy,  philanthropic endeavours, religion, causes of significance, etc.)\n\n Otherwise, the well turns into a cauldron of rumination and self recrimination. ("You're not good enough because...).\nIronically, it is in the doing something (and not dreaming of something) that my feelings of inadequacy dissipate.
4	I think it’s less our type and more just a human thing in society to compare ourselves to others.\nIts something all types struggle with.
2	I think there's probably some correlation, yes. I used to beat myself up over this or that, but eventually instead of being sad I just took feelings of inadequacy as a tool to push myself forward. Then you start seeing feelings of inadequacy not as negative, but a neutral trait. Discontent is the brain's way of saying 'I don't like something, it has to be fixed/dealt with' the same way physical pain alerts the body that there is an injury in need of healing.\n\nEx:\n\n* I feel inadequate at school because my grades are low\n* I feel inadequate with my friendships because I don't spend time with them\n* I feel inadequate at work because I am not performing at my best\n* etc.\n\nThere's a reason you feel inadequate, and it's often something that can be fixed. Fix the thing causing anxiety, and the anxiety itself goes away.\n\nThe other comments here have pretty much said all that there is.
3	I tend to feel like I'm behind or not getting enough things done.
1	I'm quite easily content in regard to these subjects, because realistically i am doing quite well in academics ,  with my social circle and a load of other things, but i rarely feel satisfied because i feel like i could always improve something, if that makes sense
0	I tend to feel like I'm behind or not getting enough things done.
16	What are Favorite Qualities About Yourself?	I feel like most of us ENFJs have some great qualities. At the same time, I feel many of us may not like to talk about ourselves and rather direct the conversation to those around us.\n\nWith that said, it’s fair to take some time and realize your strengths and weaknesses. It took many years and retrospection for me to see that it is ok to feel confident about myself and lead with it. I was just always afraid of appearing arrogant or attention seeking but I’ve finally been able to make the distinctions of those traits in myself. \n\nIn regards to my question, my favorite qualities about myself would be my ability to talk to anyone and be genuine in it while also being able to look on the bright side of things in difficulty. These are both things that took years of struggle, awkwardness, shyness, harsh realities, and hardships to manifest but its been able to strongly mold these characteristics. \n\nI always find a lot of inspiring things from peoples’ experiences from this subreddit and I would like to know what you are most proud of in yourself :)\n\n\n
11	Aye being genuine with anyone is enjoyable. \nMy mind Probably is my top most appreciated. Have always been incredibly socially? And emotionally/mentally intelligent? \nLess on the knowledge and more on the people and ins/outs.\n\nVery self conscience which I like but curse myself for at times.\n\nAnd I don’t really enjoy bragging so typing all of this out has been cringeworthy for me ha\n\nHow patient I can be with people.\n
5	[deleted]
7	Probably how forgiving I am. How I’ll always make space for people in my life if they need me/someone no matter how badly they might’ve treated me. And not because I’m a sucker, but cos I don’t like to hold on to anger. Nothing good ever came of it. My empathy, I feel like I absorb emotions. I also think I’m a pretty good reader of people, even though I’ll always try to see the best in some and it can distort my judgement slightly. 
5	This is SO true.  I do not like seeming arrogant and have always been outwardly humble to the point of self-degradation.  This is something I am working on changing.  \n\nMy good qualities are emotional intelligence, humor, being genuine, being kind, and being able to think fast/problem solve!  \n\nMy negative qualities are a lack of patience as well as being a bit too intense for people sometimes: like most ENFJs, I like to be happy and live life to the fullest which can be intense for some more super chill people.\n\nAs an ENFJ, I think the best quality a person can have is to be genuine.  
2	I'm really determined - if I start something, you best believe I'm going to finish it, and do it as well as I can.\n\nI'm openminded and able to have a balanced perspective on something - I've been told that I'm good at breaking down or understanding complex stories or arguments instead of deciding to take one side immediately.\n\nI'm genuine with people. Sometimes I get nervous about saying how I feel itself (ex: I'd rather tell a friend what I like about them than just straight-up be like "I love you"), but for the things I DO end up saying, you can guarantee they're true. (with VERY rare exceptions, like if I know someone is a gossip and might twist what I say badly... but I'm not just gonna lie for the hell of it or to make myself look better otherwise. if we have a good relationship or even just a neutral one, I'm not lying to you)\n\nI don't know this for sure, because I can't see myself from this perspective quite as well, but I've been told multiple times that I'm a good person to vent to or have difficult or deep discussions with. I'm not sure what it is about me that makes this the case, and it's hardly been appropriate for me to ask that to the people who've said that at the time they did, but I guess it maybe ties in with my openmindedness again, plus listening skills and empathy.
2	Great post btw. We have so much in common with each other. I am a high school math teacher and what I love most about myself is consistent with the compliments and positive feedback that I get from colleagues, students, parents, and administrators. That is to say, it is clear that I am passionate about what I do and have compassion for each person in my life. It is authenticity and sincerity that bring out these traits and they are my favorites.
1	great thread! I suppose what I like about myself is my optimism, how I don't take things personally (to a certain degree, more on this below), and that people I meet and work with end up being my friends and that they'd like to work with me more. \n\nI work in the film industry. lately I've been working more in short-term productions (3 weeks) so I get to meet new people every time I start a new show. I love meeting new people, and whenever I see a familiar face, I love how I get to work with them again. with the ones I get to work with again, they keep saying how it's always nice that I keep them sane and that I'm always so level-headed and easy to work with. \n\nmind you, in this industry, not everyone is always nice. there are some bad eggs, too. with those bad eggs, I tend to keep my cool and still be professional. this is where I shine in that I never take things personally. if you do, you're just going to have a bad time. life's too short to always think negatively. pick your battles, and go with the flow. \n\nin my personal life, I'm very easygoing. I suppose this can also bite me back in that I'm so easygoing that I can let go of too many things to a point that some people can take advantage of me. my guy keeps reminding me this, so I have to remember to have some boundaries (not a lot, but some) and make sure I still have time for myself. 
9	Shutting people out	How do you let them back in after shutting them out?
14	Ya don’t 
5	1. decide if it’s worth letting them back in your life\n2. start small (a text every now and then to show you do care, maybe meet up for lunch, or maybe even an apology if the situation is right) \n\nStarting small can help you feel more comfortable about letting them back in. Also, if you decide ultimately that you don’t want to, then you didn’t make this grand display that you have to go back on. 
4	I don’t think you ever really do, not truly. There are people on my life now who I have shut out, and although the friendship has been rebuilt, it is a shadow of what it was before. I would like it to be how it was, but it is just impossible for me to get back to there emotionally. 
1	I think it depends on WHY you have shut someone out. I have done this once, and the cause was my over thinking of something that was really nothing. It was actually my fears and insecurities that got the better of me.
7	Need help with ENFJ	I'm an introvert and my ENFJ girlfriend is the biggest outgoing, extroverted nature-freak. We don't live together but she plans to devote her life to traveling and exploring "different countries". She is also not sure if she wants children. We're both in our early 20s. I want to settle down at some point, have a kid.\n\nWhenever we talk about this, I see that immaturity, that level of high standards that some of the younger generation often falls for - watching the world and the life at large through rosy shades of adulthood. I've met innumerable youths with dreams like these and I can't help but ask- how many really do get to live this dream? Are they even viable, or realistic goals? Unless you're an extraordinary veteran in your field with too much time and money on your hands or a lucky kid spending your parents' hard-earned fortune on world tours, I don't think this is a possibility. To be honest, the only viable world tour package I found covered just the major cities across the globe in 3 months. And it costs nothing short of $20,000 USD minimum. Possibly even more with misc expenses. Not sure who can afford to take these trips frequently like that (going on a 3 month vacation (without pay, ofc) every year is a nice way to get yourself fired no matter how much of a genius you are, even as a CEO of a company you can't afford that luxury). Now one pattern I've noticed is that everyone I've met with these dreams has never actually had a job. They're all college-goers (including my girlfriend). I have 5 years of industry experience and I know enough to say- these are all pipe dreams. Sure you can go camping, visit a state in your own country maybe even go overseas once in a while, but not REMOTELY as close to what my girlfriend and said people daydream about.\n\nI guess my question is: Should I break the bad news to her or break up with her? Because obviously, if our long-term goals are so different, there's no point in staying together. But at the same time, I love her so much that I can't stand the thought of her getting shattered in a few years from now when she realizes the harsh reality of the world at large as opposed to her dreams and what she sacrificed for that whole lotta nothingness. I mean, don't get me wrong I've had friends whose parents had worked for international oil and steel giants and they get transferred to different countries depending on the project every couple of years. The only other case that comes to mind is the traveling agents but even they mostly take the trips for business, not pleasure. And by no means am I saying that I don't like traveling or I'm stopping her from going wherever she wants. In fact, I've been extremely supportive of her going places of her own accord. But whenever I ask her about my dreams, she either changes the subject or goes silent or avoids the topic. My parents have always had plenty itch to go see the world, but they also had and brought up their children just fine while also simultaneously making time for their family trips every once in a while. I do wish the best for her and no one would be happier than me if she actually gets what she wants but I know for a fact that she's setting herself up for disappointment and that just makes it that much harder for me to break up with her since I've always been there for her whenever she gets depressed. Aside from this "conflict", we're very happy. And I swear to God, she's the purest, most innocent, joyful, everyone's-best-interests-at-heart, environmentalist, human/animal rights activist-type, good samaritan, polite, considerate, kind, genuine, top-of-the-line human being I've ever met in all of my 24 years. And yes, I meant every single word of that.\n\nWhat do I do?
8	This has nothing to do with ENFJ-ness and everything to do with her idealism/ expectations of her life and the world... It's quite a common dream/ goal at her age as well. Who knows, she might be the lucky one?\n\nYou have 2 issues here: 1) you think that her dream is unrealistic and 2) if her dream is possible, you don't think you can stay with her.\n\nNumber 1) is not for you to "educate" her on because really, she might be the lucky one. Even if she doesn't SEEM to understand that it is unrealistic, she will learn it in time and on her own when she tries to plan it out. There are many people out there like her who are not wealthy but happy to live minimally and travel the world. 2) is what you need to communicate to her about.

4	ENFJs are complicated by nature and I think approaching with honesty and maturity are the best ways to deal with the emotional roller coaster some ENFJs display in a stressful time in your relationship with one. I think your girlfriend sounds like she's trying to find herself and understand the world she lives in and that should be supported, but can be extremely difficult if you are not included in that self discovery. This is a lesson in your own self discovery and learning too. My girlfriend recently took a trip abroad that I was unable to join her on and I really had strong insecurities in myself with her being gone for such a long time, but with her absence I was able to discover my own self and realize that two people pursing something they love apart from each other allows them to come back and have something meaningful to share. Encouraging independence in your partner often risks the chance that they could leave you, but to me it sounds like the love you've developed is pure. My advice to you is to ride this one out and see where it goes, ENFJs can be ever-shifting in their goals and desires for what they want and so long as she tries to include you in some fashion and you're pursing your passion outside of your personal relationship with this person, you both can find deep meaning and respect for each other in your pursuits of meaning. 
2	I meet conflicts then make the conflicts have conflicts with me!\n\nBut I was conflict avoidant do to self esteem issues for awhile. \n\nNow on to your issues OP, \n\nHave you ever discussed longterm plans for life? Mid Twenties is really soon to decide what someone is doing forever, or having a kid, and trying to plan this out when they are in college. Thats a lot to make someone decide when their life is up in the air like that. \n\nI'm also not sure why I read into this post and see that you have a desire to stomp on her dreams, but I do. I think you made this post as a way to get "permission" to go through with it. I get the feeling you are trying to make this a black and white situation that is all or nothing, but life is all compromise. \n\nOP, you don't sound happy, so maybe it's time to have a chat about where you see your relationship going, aside from all the other external factors. 
2	Going into research is a great way to see the world. After Uni she can do a PhD overseas and then a post-doc somewhere else. \n\nBut with that said I don't think her "unrealistic dreams" are the problem.\n\nFirst of all, dreams are just that; dreams. That all of them may not come true doesn't mean she shouldn't aspire to follow them. You also said you feel like she sometimes disregard your thoughts about future. I think you guys have a lot to talk about.\n\nAlso you can drop the talk about the "younger generation" having hopeless aspirations. You're 24 for gods sake. You are still part of said younger generation. Make some own dreams and live a little.
2	Hey, I am ENFJ and I am really simialar to your GF. And I want to say that I have also big dreams and these dreams had helped me a lot to go forward in everything. Right now I understand that maybe those dreams are too big but anyway, I believe I will achieve at least half of this way. But I could never go to half of the way If I dont't see the end of the way and I am not going for it. But important - in the end if I see how much afford the "just half way" took, I am also really happy for it. \nI mean -  she can have bigg dreams, but if you try to tell her its wrong - she will probably not listen and also it can be really important to her to have them. \nAnyway if she wants travel the world 3 months each year and also have a job - maybe in the end she will do so just with 1 month or so but for sure she will travel a lot. I mean she will probably cut her dreams a bit, but not change totaly. So 1. Yes, just let her dream and you can know your truth its a bit overdreaming but 2.if you are not happy even with the way she is going (for example you dont want your wife to travel so much) you probably dont have the same way in life. \nJust writing my view, it doesnt have to work for everyone :) Good luck! 
1	It sounds like you're realistic about having different long-term goals, so your relationship has an expiry date on it. Whether your girlfriend's dreams are viable or not don't really matter - if she doesn't want to settle down and have a child like you, then things are going to get problematic over the long haul. I am a childfree ENFP (as in, I don't have kids and don't want them) and couldn't have a serious, monogamous relationship with someone who wants children.\n\nP.S. I'll be honest, she also sounds a lot more ENFP than ENFJ. Most ENFJ women I've come across are eager to settle down and have kids, while ENFPs usually enjoy the more nomadic lifestyle.
2	I cant tell whether I am an ENFJ or ENFP	I keep getting tests going back and forth. How do you guys know you are an enfj? \n\nEven the descriptions of both of them fit me perfectly. 
10	What kind of explanation do you want, cognitive wise? Stereotypically,\n\n\- ENFJ has more heavy presence to the surrounding, ENFP is more light hearted and funny.\n\n\- ENFJ usually is upset if you turn his suggestion down, ENFP is fine with it.\n\n\- ENFJ love organizing people or write a plan on a paper, ENFP prefers to just do it out of spur of moment.\n\n\- ENFJ doesn't prefer sudden changes, ENFP is adaptable.\n\n\- ENFJ wants to know everyone's opinion, thoughts and feelings about anything. Will most likely make people open up their childhood trauma. ENFP is ok with it but that's not the first thing they do when they first meet new people.\n\n\- ENFJ has the tendency to start a 'revolution' if they've strong disagreement about something, ENFP prefers to blend in and accept things the way they're.\n\n\-ENFJ is most likely going to lead the group.\n\n\-ENFJ is more decisive and ENFP is more open.- ENFJ is like a teacher or politican and ENFP is entertainer, somebody exists to give you a good laugh.
6	My husband is an ENFP and my daughter is an ENFJ.  Don't be fooled by the fact that they are only one letter off -- these two have all different cognitive functions, so don't try to just pinpoint the stereotypical difference between "P" and "J".  \n\nAlso, no one is "in between" two different types.  Especially not two types with all different functions!\n\nThe most obvious differences that I've noticed between an ENFJ and an ENFP are these:\n\nENFJ's are obsessed with their friends.  They cannot handle even the slightest rejection and they cannot ever have enough friends, love or acceptance.  It's kind of an overwhelming need, and without those things they fall into depression easily.  They wear their hearts on their sleeves.  They are extremely generous and compassionate, and are much more in tune with other people's feelings and wants than their own. Besides the need for acceptance, ENFJ's have a secondary need to inspire people.  They want to lead, not out of bossiness, but to make everyone around them as enthusiastic as they are.\n\nENFP's, on the other hand, are obsessed with their freedom.  They cannot handle even the slightest control without turning into anti-authority rebels.  They don't want to be boxed in or defined, so they resist rules and labels for themselves --even ones they make. They need variety, not constancy.  They rarely make shopping lists, follow recipes or cook the same meal twice.  ENFP's become depressed when they feel trapped -- trapped in an unfulfilling relationship, job, etc.  They love new experiences and new ideas and can talk your ear off about them.  Besides the need for freedom and variety, ENFP's have a secondary need to pursue a righteous cause.  They have strong values and tap into them for inspiration when looking for which causes to dedicate themselves to. 
3	The main difference between me and my ENFP friend I find:\n\nMeeting up I’m always early, she’s always running late.\n\nAlso she is braver than I am when making big life choices. \n\nDoes this help?
3	[deleted]
3	Mmmmmm well I'm dating an ENFJ (M) and I am an ENFP (F).I'll start with the similarities:\n\n I have to say we are VERY similar\n\n\- Both start conversations with new people very easily\n\n\- Both love having a lot of friends.- Both love trying out new things.\n\n\- Both very superficial (looks matter a lot)\n\n\- Both have high sex drive.- Both full of ourselves :/...\n\n\- Both tend to rebound/jump into new relationships\n\nHere are some differences..\n\n\-  He (ENFJ) keeps a schedule and is always on time. I (ENFP) am always late, and change my mind what I wanna do all the time.\n\n\- He (ENFJ) hates housework but does it cos he has to. I (ENFP) hate housework and avoid it at all costs (run away) until I'm forced into it.\n\n\- He (ENFJ) makes strong judgments about people (hates women who smoke etc). I am more of a "You do You m8" kind of person\n\n\- He (ENFJ) prefers privacy. I (ENFP) overshare on social media too much :(.......\n\n\- He (ENFJ) cares how other men think of me. Very aware of how people perceive us. Seems to like it when other men find me attractive.  I (ENFP) don't really think about what other women think of him. Probably think he's a dork anyways :) hurhur.\n\nWhich one do you think you are?
2	I took the test 4 years ago and was an ENFP. I just retook it last night and was an ENFJ. These tests aren’t 100% accurate and you can’t perfectly fit someone in to personality box by simply selecting varying degrees of Agree or Disagree on a handful of questions. While these tests are great for narrowing down your core personality traits, it’s important to remember that there is a lot of grey area and overlapping traits. Not every ENFP or ENFJ is exactly the same, even though we are lumped in to a singular group. 
2	Maybe you're just kind of in the middle. A cusper :)
16	INTRO THREAD: Say Hi!	Thought it would be interesting to meet others and see what this rare community is up to around the world! So feel free to write a short intro! I suppose I'll write one first to get things going...\n

15	Hey all! Discovered I was a ENFJ today, weird how spot on it is! A bit about me: I'm a tech entrepreneur from the UK; pretty creative dude (web designer, software engineer, video producer...); always told I can be too nice lol; will always love helping ppl around me; goal in life is to at least try to make a contribution/difference to the world with one of my tech inventions! :) Anyways, keep on smiling!

3	Haaayo I’m an ENFJ and am at a very exciting transition of starting grad school in a few weeks for photography WEEEE! This is my main identifier, but I love drawing, floating on water, turning up happy music when I’m driving so I can dance with fellow drivers at red lights and listening + learning from everyone through all their unique string of life experiences :) 
3	Hello!  I was an ENFP years ago and as I got older, turned into an ENFJ.  I love helping people as well and am very much focused on relationships with people as I'm sure most ENFJs here are.  I was a teacher but my slight lack of patience didn't really work in that field, so now I am obtaining an MBA and plan on being a supply chain manager for a company that makes a positive difference in the world.  It is so nice to have everyone on here for advice and understanding; what a great community we have here!  Nice to meet everyone!

2	Hey guys. I switch between getting "ENFJ" and "ENFP" on the Myers Briggs test. So, im not quite sure what I actually am but I thought I would say hello. My name is Lexi and hmm.. Something random about me..  I'm very particular about the people that I get close to. I also love to work with kids. 
2	Hey, I'm Mike, 24.\nI work in finance becoming a stock broker.\nI love dancing, I'm good at negotiating between parties. Big family, so we're a bunch of goofs that joke with each other.\nMy friend group is small, like 4 close friends and I know too many people.\nBeen told I'm a good friend, listener, helper and quick with come backs.\nVery active.\nI hope to hear new ideas that I can add to my hobbies.\nI've noticed ENTJ have vast interests carrying between gathering vast in depth knowledge, role play games, interesting active activities,never a bore, but always interesting. 
2	Hey everyone,\n\nI'm an ENFJ. Self-improvement has always been something that's been very important to my lifestyle, and I've consistently been working out at least 4 times a week since Spring 2014. Playing tennis and Super Smash Bros competitively are two hobbies of mine that I'm very passionate about. I like to compare the two, and see it as playing tennis is for my **body**, and Super Smash Bros is for my **mind**.  \n\n\nThey are both 1v1 fast-paced competitions where countless hours of practice come into play, and the person with the most skill wins.
1	New to this sub, new to the knowledge of being an ENFJ (after searching for many, many years) and I immediately knew I was in the right place here after reading a handful of comments. We're all like cosmic twinsies. Hello tribe!
1	[https://imgur.com/7i9UuJz](https://imgur.com/7i9UuJz) I believe that makes me an enfj?
3	What type is likely to be a Neoreactionary?	[Neoreactionaries and MBTI](https://iamlegionnaire.wordpress.com/2015/02/13/friday-night-fragments-15/)\n\nThe above link says no one in Neoreaction isn’t an NT Rational of some sort. Could this be true? The primary figure in Neoreaction (also known as the Dark Enlightenment) is Nick Land and he published a manifesto in 2012 which could viewed as follows:\n\n[The Dark Enlightenment, by Nick Land](http://www.thedarkenlightenment.com/the-dark-enlightenment-by-nick-land/)
14	24M Just found out that I'm an ENFJ. Feeling relived that I better understand myself now.	I took one test and got enfj, but before reading about that personality type I took a different personality test just to see if I would get the same result and I did!\n\nI thought to myself, "hmm, I guess that's me! Let's see how vague this description will be". As I started to read about enfj's, my heart dropped. It was nearly 100% spot on! So accurate that I thought it was a joke! I thought to myself, how could this so accurately describe my personality with just a few questions? \n\nIt was an incredible feeling being able to understand why I feel and act the way I do with my friends and family. I felt relived. For the longest I felt that something was wrong with how much I cared about other people and how I always did a better job at stimulating them instead of myself. \n\nI always took charge in groups. But, not like a dictator, someone who included everyone and worked with their strengths and weaknesses. I loved teaching people new things and seeing that light bulb go off in their head. I find myself trusting people to a fault, but always looked past that. \n\nIt feels great to understand the way I feel. Now I can better understand my weaknesses and become and even better ENFJ!!!! (: \n\nThanks for reading!\n\nP.S. If you guys have any advice, I would love to hear it!
3	Welcome to the ENFJ club! 23M, trying not to complicate things here but I'm the minority enneagram 3 unlike the rest ENFJs (commonly are enneagram 2) so we might be different in some ways. Advice? As long as you take care of your need before others everything will be fine. ENFJ is known to be among the best judge of character, 'mind reader' and an excellent persuader so make sure you polish those skills to the max. You'll be surprised at how persuasive you can be, you can get a bunch of expensive stuff for free from just talking with people (no kidding! lol). Of course there are other things we can do with it. We make a good politician, copywriter, pscyhologist and teacher or anything really.
48	the small issue with the ENFJ reddit	Hi everyone, I'm an ENFJ and I was extremely excited when I found this reddit. Overall I still think it is great, however I wanted to voice a criticism. Lately, I have noticed a lot of posts asking for advice on relationships and other issues not specific to ENFJs. Many of these posts are fine but some don't really have to do with the ENFJ personality type and probably belong in a different reddit group. While ENFJs do have a lot in common, every specific situation and ENFJ person is different. I'd like to see this reddit become more about the ENFJ personality type and less about people's relationship problems and whatnot. I'm curious to hear if ya'll agree with me or not and felt like voicing my opinion. Thanks for reading.
20	Totally agree. It's been a bit excessive lately.
12	Agreed! r/relationships is where many of these posts better belong
11	I don't mind. The thing is, even with or without relationship thread there's still less thread about ENFJ personality in general. We are the least active NF in reddit. Maybe most of us are busy with in real life work or maybe we simply don't have much things left to say.
8	I’ve also seen a lot about INFP relationship or INFPs asking questions about us. I actually date an INFP myself and I found this mildly entertaining at first. Now it seems like every time I log in it’s posts from INFPs asking for advice. I don’t want to alienate any other mbti type coming for advice but it just seems a bit much... maybe we could have like a weekly or monthly thread just for other mbti types to ask us questions? This board seems more like we answer others questions than actually interact amongst members... 
5	I just ignore them. Thought of explaining that stuff to those that post it but that’s a never ending job lol
4	I haven't been here a whole lot yet, but I'd have to say I agree.
5	I agree - I am sort of done with the INFP needing relationship advice - I say this as someone married to an INFP.  
3	The thing is, what are ENFJs supposed to talk about? If memory serves me correctly, there's a theory from the folks at Personality Hacker that says that the Auxiliary function is hard to engage with and so with ENFJs, it's Ni. The Se in the ENFJ is engaging with the world out there and so the things that could be talked about just seem unnecessary in an internet forum because it may be work-related which is why you hear the point about ENFJs being so engaged "out there in the real world." It's pretty obvious there's substance to the Dominant-Tertiary Loop Theory in spite of it I believe initially starting with the INFJ. I think this subreddit might be better with discussing many various other issues/things that may be more philosophical, psychological, perhaps broader questions/theories/insights, and so maybe it should mirror more of the ENTJ subreddit? Anyways, it could be just that ENFJs don't like to engage in politics and current events and stuff so what's left to say? Some people may say that ENFJs like to talk about people but the thing is, what's even the point of that if each and every individual ENFJ sort of already have a vague idea as to what that's all about? 
2	Probably because ENFJs are good problem-solvers.\n\nBut hey, I just mentioned this problem with another person in chat. Pretty boring actually, to see relationship advice posts flooding around. 
2	I am guilty of this but the advice I’ve received here has really helped me. Even more, I’ve been happy to help others with their relationship questions and grateful to see that I’ve helped them.\n\nI browse this subreddit often but it never hit me that it was excessive. I think ENFJs are naturally attracted to helping people with their problems so it always seemed nice that people could open up and hear others out. I do get where you’re coming from though!! 
2	ENFJ-ESFJ relationships?	Any ENFJs dated ESFJs or been in a serious relationship with one?\n\nHow did it go?/How is it going?
3	I am in one right now!!! It’s hands down the best relationship I have EVER been in!! \n\nWe are both very understanding, which has made it almost an entire year of no arguments. We both constantly work to do whatever we can to make the other as happy as possible. I also love that we both care so much for others, we are both usually on the same pace when it comes to going out/staying in. \n\nEdit: typo
2	Since you all are such hopeless romantics, what is your dream partner like?	INFP here, I'm afraid I don't know much about ENFJs in the way of first hand expierence, with a couple of exceptions. So call me curious.
15	Honest, loyal, kind, knows when space is needed, playful, accepting, determined, likes to explore, motivated, deep also mature, not so hung up on materials that it effects everything, and willing to make the relationship feel 50/50!
9	I value kindness the most in people.\n\nMy closest friends and people I admire are deeply kind. It doesn’t have to be obvious from the outside. It’s something I can normally sense when I first meet a person. Even if that person seems quite rough around the edges or aloof/ambivalent when you first meet them and they keep this part of themselves hidden (eg my INTP and ENTP friends) \n\nit’s like an instinct that tells me pay attention to this person or get to know this person telling me that they and I will get along well and it’s usually right.\n\nMy partner (infj) is the kindest person I know. He wore his heart on his sleeve and wasn’t afraid to love openly despite heartache he faced in the past. He pushed himself to show love even more. This is what I admired the most about him, and he inspired me to to love more honestly and openly too. He always strives to improve himself and I have so much respect for the person he is. He likes how I recognise and appreciate his selflessness, but also how I can step in and make sure people don’t take advantage of it. 
17	Working out and being the best me. Alone vs. with someone.	What I feel to be an enfj feature of mine is I am simply at my best when I am with someone/for someone. \n\nWorking out alone, the mental battles to do it/motivate myself, are tough. I didn’t form the habit early enough so it’s hard to start and stick with it.\nBut every time I have a partner, usually a girlfriend, whom exercises with me, I find myself having zero issues motivating myself to not only do it, but go above and beyond.\n\nI’ve talked to some people about this and some say they do it too because to impress, or because you have someone to do it for, but for me it’s different.\n\nI’ve noticed I go above and beyond with no need of a mental battle when with someone not for myself but for them. I go hard and get really psyched and motivated while doing it so that they don’t struggle or fall behind. So that they stick with it and feel good. \nTo better others I push myself.\n\nIt’s a little sad I have a hard time doing it for myself. \n\nI am at my best physically, socially, emotionally, mentally, when with someone, and also when for someone. \nI am okay on my own.
7	Took me so so long to figure this out, mostly because I'm usually alone (social anxiety issues), so most people identify me as an 'I' instead of 'E' because they see me in non-ideal states and accept that as my nature. \n\nIt's good to work on both though - don't be sad about it, those alone motivation times are an opportunity to flex that auxiliary process muscle.. Don't limit your definition of yourself just because one feels more natural. I meet plenty of people on the opposite side - perfectly capable of pushing themselves but either shit with other people or when other people try to build with them they fall apart. Natural is not better, it is easier, but variety of experience is really the key to a fully developed, idealized path (IMO). 
3	Can relate. As a 3w2 ENFJ I work hard by thinking about those whom I love. I'm proud to say that I'm born to help people as long as I've met my need first. Balanced is all you need, remind yourself of things that motivate you when you're alone. 
2	A request, as a guest.	Hello!    \n     \nI would like to get to know ENFJs better in an active, non lurker sense.   Every time I come to this sub to post and try, however, I wind up forgetting the type flairs.    \n       \nNow, don't get me wrong, I do want to have a type flair so that I don't have to worry that people will think I've mistyped myself as an ENFJ.  However, I also feel profoundly silly with, "the visionary," next to my name like I'm some kind of sage.  I'm not a visionary.  I'm not a sage.  I'm not actually Gandhi.   I'm a dork.   Is there any chance that the mods would consider allowing custom type flairs so that I can keep things simple at just, "INFJ," or, if all else fails, consider changing the INFJ flag to something less grandiose?   \n     \nA few hunble suggestions for potential INFJ titles:     \n       \nThe over thinker.     \n      \nThe anxious.    \n      \nThe mistyped INFP.     \n      \nLord of type, all hail.    \n      \nThe same type as Hitler, but definitely not Hitler.     \n       \nThe, "not Ghandi, either."     \n       \nThe snowflake.    \n       \nThe emotional chamelion.    \n      \nThe mistress of tango.    \n       \nThe clueless.    \n       \nThe Glib.   \n     \nThe god complex, personified.      \n         \nThe depressed.     \n     \nThanks in advance for your kind consideration.    \n        \nSincerely,    \n         \nThe INFJ\n\n
6	Thank you ENFJs of this sub! <3	...and the INTPs that have been messaging me in my inbox :P  \n\n\nA lot of you have been giving me advice the past six-ish months on my ENFJ that I met in January. Well, we're now officially besties!!!! - but, like, we don't actually call each other that because...no, just no. But I couldn't be happier! I haven't had a close friend in YEARS! and you guys helped with that SO much!!!\n\nI know a lot of people have doubts about the INTP/ENFJ pairing - and they're not unwarranted - but it is possible.\n\nThe things that make us work (may or may not be type related):  \n\- we're both workaholics (BIG plus!)  \n\- we both like our space but make time for each other if we're needed by the other ASAP  \n\- our interests, careers & goals are very similar  \n\- "Quality Time" is my primary love language and his secondary (Words of Affirmation is his primary), so we might not spend a lot of time together but what we do spend is AWESOME  \n\- he gets energized by my childlike enthusiasm for...everything...haha!  \n\- we're both self-aware and both try to give the other what they need  \n\- he's very individualistic and self-contained/sufficient. (Me likey!)  \n\- our conversations can last hours  \n\- his hugs are amazing  \n\- he's so pretttttty...I mean! Uh.... >.>  \n\n\nThings that ain't so great but are improving (from an INTP POV):\n\n  \n\- if he thinks something is going to hurt me, he just avoids telling me about it  \n\- he can't handle conflict with other people & tries to protect me when I don't need protecting (I appreciate it, though!)  \n\- he is moody AF and sometimes I don't pick up on it (I'm trying to improve that area.)  \n\- sometimes he's very confident and other times...far less so. This means I HAVE to reach into that part of me I don't use often and bring on those Words of Affirmation he needs so badly. Not an easy feat but worth it when that little half-smile appears and he says, "Thank you."  \n\- I can be a bit high-strung, especially in crowds. He spends most of the time while we're out at a bar or equally crowded place, going, "Will you chill? Relax!" XD  \n\- sorry, I know this is a sticking point for a lot of people against the INTP/ENFJ pairing but no, we aren't direct about our feelings. We both have intimacy issues. (He's an Enneagram 3w4, I'm 5w4) After 6 months, I made the first move and texted, "I care for you." He replied with, "It's surprising how close we've grown in such a short time. I care for you, too."   \n\- he's completely indecisive and inconsistent on the big things. (I think this is where my eternally adaptable P is the best thing for him)\n\nUltimately, I enjoy my time with him very much. We get each other, even in ways that aren't type related. I don't know what the future holds - though I strongly suspect that in one of his fantasy possibilities we're married because of some things he's referenced - but I'm happy I met him. I've never (knowingly) met an ENFJ. I mostly hang around damaged ENTPs and ENTJs, so this has been a refreshing change. I also like this pace if we are to ever end up more than friends. I have a lot of trauma to work through and he has his own things to get past (like his ex).  \n\n\nTL;DR: It's possible for INTP/ENFJs to work in relationships but it takes some effort on both parts (that's probs true for just humans in general). Also, thank you to this sub for helping a weird loner INTP girl make a lifelong ENFJ friend in the real world!  XD  \n
2	I loved reading this tbh, and I went back and read your whole tale, it's all adorable and I love it! I related to it in my own way and I guess wanted to share that story too.   \n\n\nI've been with my INTP boyfriend for about 4 months now, but we've known each other for almost 3 years though. He was my best friend first, and still is of course, and we just connect on such a deep level. We've talked everyday since I met him, I can listen to him for hours and never get tired. I genuinely love his excitement and passion over different topics. \n\nI fell for him super hard about a year into our friendship, or more accurately I realized my own feelings as "more than just platonic love." He had a gf for a long while, hence why we didn't really get together until recently. The gf happened to be my other best friend... and *I was the one who hooked them up so after I realized I had feelings for him I felt like a scumbag.* I told them both how I felt, but in fairness I just needed to get it off my chest because the guilt was weighing on me heavily. His gf didn't care in the slightest, as in, was completely fine with it and went as far as suggesting I pursue it... she is INFP and also Aromantic. I didn't, because I felt that would have been wrong and he was happy with her. At the time, he told me he didn't know how he felt towards me. I could tell he was lying, but I didn't push it. I told him he could think on it and tell me, or not tell me, later how he felt and that I was the intruder there and I wanted to respect his happiness and feelings with his gf. I didn't bring it up again after, but it did tear at me inside for a long time. \n\nLater, after she broke up with him, he told me that he did love me and had realized it about a month into his relationship with her, but had shoved it away because he's dedicated to the person he's with. He said that me expressing my feelings towards him gave him great relief but also made him feel very conflicted, so he shoved those feelings away too. I was there for him when they went through their breakup, and at some point he said something along the lines of "I'm worried I'll never be wanted." And I just lost my goddamned mind when he said that. I told him on the spot exactly how much he meant to me, how much I loved him. I think I floored him in that instant. I let him sleep on that. The next day I asked him out after noticing him very visibly flirting with me and we've been together since then. \n\nHe has depth to him, and he is a very deeply caring person, even if other people don't see it. He just shows it in different ways, smaller shows of affection and genuine compassion. He validates me, gives me the solid emotional connection I crave. Or in short, he makes me feel loved and wanted, and I can tell it isn't superficial. I know INTPs aren't really ones for huge shows of affection, but he goes out of his own comfort zone to make sure I'm aware that he loves me and he does it almost daily. \n\nWe have our fair share of issues of course and have had fights in the past, but everything has always been talked about thoroughly after both parties have calmed down. We are still learning each other, and I'm honestly always excited to get to know more about him.\n\n(*I seem to have written a small novel, whoops. Sorry!)*\n\nI'm glad you two connected and became friends! And I hope things continue going well for you in that relationship :\]
19	Advice on Staying Focused	Are there any other ENFJs who struggle to stay focused when they need to get shit done? I've realized this when it comes to studying, I'll work for 5 minutes and then zone out and go on my phone or something. Even when I do work hard, I'll take unneccessarily long breaks before getting back to work. \n\n I have seen that when I'm focused, I can really go in and understand a lot of concepts in a single sitting --- I just don't know how to stay consistent in that\n\nI'm very impressed by people who can sit and study for hours on end and I am trying to reach that level. They say ENFJs are the type to have the least trouble when it comes to academics so I assume many of you are apt in this skill\n\nAny tips or advice? 
9	Lol sounds like me if I don't prep. \n\nBasically prep, practice and acknowledge when you're getting distracted. Please see your primary care doctor about this to rule out ADHD. Foreal some people don't have it. We don't practice enough of mental focus for tasks as we should. I like the comments above!\n\nPrep: \n- make a list of what you need to do (sometimes I sort out my priority or time length of what would take the least to the most amount of time *** depends on the task compared to a project***)\n- create a reasonable schedule (don't think you can do everything today or within 30 minutes), stick to it\n- select a location where you feel productive like the school library or cafe (make the bedroom and study room separate)\n- stay hydrated and eat when needed (you'll notice when you're dehydrated once it's habitual to drink a lot)\n- have minimal materials when you do study/work (foreal you don't need 20 pens if you're rewriting stuff)\n- exercise can help (if your mind is everywhere and clears it up)\n\nPractice: \n- use pomodoro time (25 min straight continuous work/5 min break or 45/15)\n- if you're constantly on your phone use Forest app similar to pomodoro but you grow plants and they did if you exit the app\n- if you do get distracted make a mental (meditate by noting) or physical note (write it down on a sticky note)\n- if you need motivational markers treat yourself to something small like watch 1 episode of GOT\n- look up on YT study with me videos they're amazing!\n\nDistracted:\n- meditate\n- are you avoiding work/study?\n- are you burnt out?\n- are you being lazy?\n- did something emotionally draining happen?\n- figure out what's making you distracted vs interruptions \n\n*** I'm trying to be a Physician Assistant. My schedule ATM is hectic. Take a break and figure it all out! Wish you the best and if you need more help lmk!***
5	Dude I would suggest getting checked for add/adhd.\n\nFormer enfj here, and my life was nothing but frustration until I was diagnosed and put on medication.\n\nAlso...adderall sucks compared to vyvanse. \n\nIf you just have focus issues then I would suggest checking out ADHD youtube channels all the same a lot of them put out helpful videos to help combat the issues with focusing that plague a lot of people.
4	As a former enfj (now entj), I used to have the same issues. Procrastination is wired in enfjs. Essentially this comes down to your inferior function, Ti or introverted thinking, which is the least developed function you possess. It’s akin to going into a mental rabbit hole when overwhelmed. Dark distracting obsessive lingering thoughts that are hard to shake off. You will also assume you already know the subject as this enfjs may believe they have a more developed T function that they really do. This in return makes for bad decision making at a critical stage in your life. “I already get it, I don’t need to study.” \n\nMy advice: accept this as a truth. You will need to make studying a part of your life part of your self image identity and life goals - not as a thing I have to do because someone said I need to and others do this so why can’t I. Before study, clear your mind and say, “ I am going to study because this is who I am.” Keep saying it until you believe it, and those thoughts dissipate and you start feeling the room and chair and desk around you. Take a deep breath and begin. You can do it! 
7	Fellow ENFJ as well, with exactly the same problem! My mum even took me to a weekly class that helped kids with their attention span when I was younger lol. \n\nWhat I thought was mildly useful from the class was, draw a dot in the middle of my palm. When distracted, look and focus on the dot and nothing else. Just look at it until my mind stopped running with a billion ideas or voices. It helped sometimes, not really at others but I hope it helps *shrugs*\n\nAlso from my recent PEP training at work, they made clear of the difference between interruptions (ie incoming email, phone call) and distractions (ie internal thoughts, daydreaming etc). I thought that was really helpful as it helped me manage interruptions and distractions in a different manner - as they should, since they’re different things. Hope that helps! 
2	Get rid of the phone and other distractions. Depending on what I'm focusing on, I might listen to techno or trance podcasts. Seems to put me in a focus zone. Or maybe I created this believe by accident by always playing certain music when I need to focus.\n\n
1	Listening to "epic instrumental soundtrack mix"s help me focus my mind. I feel like I'm in a battle with my mind to stay concentrated haha. I have to schedule brain breaks tho. It's also a lot easier to keep studying once I get sunk into it.
11	Depression / Confusion when alone?	Hello everyone,\n\nI've struggled with this my entire life and am just wondering if anyone here can relate.\n\nI never realized this subreddit existed until just now.\n\nMy question--do you guys experience a clear headed energy (that can even be euphoric at times) where you feel like you know exactly what to do with your time, how to pursue your goals, etc. when with people, then feel totally confused and depressed when alone?\n\nIt seems I am dangerously extraverted to the max, and I almost find it sort of irritating. One of my passions is writing and unfortunately this is something I usually do alone, thus I do it while feeling like shit lol.\n\nCan anyone relate to this? Is there any sort of solution so I don't constantly have to be surrounded by other humans lol--not that I don't enjoy it--I just have a few goals that require alone time every now and then, and it SUCKS
8	>*do you guys experience a clear headed energy (that can even be euphoric at times) where you feel like you know exactly what to do with your time, how to pursue your goals, etc. when with people, then feel totally confused and depressed when alone?* \n\nYes, I do! It's even worse when it's that time of the month (I'm a female)\n\n> *Is there any sort of solution* \n\nIf I can't be around other people, I'd distract myself and raise my energy up with my hobbies e.g. video games, tv shows, music, jogging. One of my passions is writing too! I find that doing so in a comfortable coffee shop also helps. Basically be alone in a public place with good energy haha.
5	I'm not an enfj but something I would like to suggest is maybe try just being in an environment near people without engagement. Have you tried doing your writing in a library or some kind of coffee shop? I like places like that because I can be near people without having to talk lol. Usually just their energy near me is enough haha
3	>  One of my passions is writing and unfortunately this is something I usually do alone, thus I do it while feeling like shit lol. \n\nWow, my passion is writing too and you just made me realise I get the urge to write when I am depressed/lonely/need to sort out my feelings. It is my escape, and the more social opportunities I have/content I am- I end up writing less! This makes a lot of sense since I've only progressed in my latest writing project when I feel a surge of difficult emotions. Looking back to when I was writing constantly (teenage years) I felt stifled and depressed IRL so I was writing constantly.
3	YES! It’s so annoying and tough. I’ve tried going to public places like coffee shops or libraries to do things around people but where I won’t be distracted talking to people I know etc. It works well.\nAlso at home I’ve taken up hobbies like cooking and gardening which I find stimulating and rewarding and I have to move around for so I don’t feel so crap. Even call a friend and have them on speaker or text someone to say hey after an hour of doing a task as a little reward!
6	How to Avoid the Friendzone?	As being the guy who talks with everyone and befriends most quickly, I have seen that I have gotten friendzoned a couple times from it. I don't really like using the term "friendzone" because it does seem like something that is done from the person themselves rather that a place that you're put into. Regardless, I wanted to get some advice.\n\nI've noticed that I would talk to girls with a friendly attitude but be more on the side of asking questions, flirting, keeping eye contact, and touching. I've seen that sometimes I'm too energetic or upbeat and this can hurt that potential intimacy. \n\nHas this happened to any of you? What are the things you all do that is able to keep you away from the friendzone and have that person see you more intimately as a potential SO?
20	The thing about the "friend zone" is that the women who put you in it were probably never attracted to you from the start, and it's not like it would change because you used some magic technique or pick up line to win them over. I know that might be hard to hear, but the truth is, if women are attracted to a man it doesn't usually change just because they become friends.\n\nMaybe some women can put people in this category in their minds no matter how attracted they are, but personally as a woman, I don't have a sharp distinction between friendship and romance in my head. I don't arbitrarily put people in one category or another when I get to know them. Either I'm attracted or I'm not, basically. I can be attracted to an unavailable platonic friend for years and it's not easy for me to just "get over it".\n\nHaving said that, if you really are attracted to a woman, it's probably better to ask them on a date (and make it clear it's a romantic date, not a friendly hangout) sooner rather than later - to avoid the awkward situation where you're close friends and then don't want to ruin the friendship. It also comes across as more honest if you make your romantic intentions clear from the start, otherwise some people might feel you were befriending them with ulterior motives.\n\nI've also heard good things about this book so it might be worth checking out: [Models: Attract Women Through Honesty by Mark Manson](https://www.amazon.com.au/Models-Attract-Women-Through-Honesty-ebook/dp/B005EOTH24)
6	I don't know about the rest of you, but I intentionally put guys i'm interested in the "Friend Zone" in order to get to know them better and see how compatible we are. I don't think I would have gone out with a guy who I didn't establish a friendship with first. When I date someone, I date someone who I see potential in for a long term relationship, and I will only form an opinion on that when I get to know them better.\n\nMy partner actually told me he liked me quite early and even though I was attracted to him I purposely friend zoned him because I felt we didn't know each other well enough and I wanted to make sure he wasn't idolising the person he thought I was.\n\nI'm not saying I haven't been attracted to people I've just met, but there is more that physical attraction to make me want to actually be with someone. 
4	They could be doing that because they don't want to assume you're interested and up getting hurt if they find out you only want to be friends. I would try being more direct (which is so much easier said than done) and asking them out.
3	Being energetic and excited is a part of who you are and you shouldn't try to change that about yourself to attract a potential partner. If you want to build a beautifel, long-lasting nd intimate relationship, it has to be with someone who will apreciate this about you!  \n\n\nIntimacy is something that takes a lot of time to build. As ENFJ, we often inspire trust and while that is the most basic thing you need to have intimacy, it is not enough. Intimacy happens when two people just stick around. When you keep on seeing each other regularly over a long period of time. And that's what friendship does basically. Friendship is about trust and intimacy. So it's not a bad thing to be put in the friendzone! I personnally put the people I am seriously intrested in in the "friendzone". Because that means I value you as a person in my life. It means I want you to stay in my life for a while so we can get to know each other better. On the other hand, if I flirt you right away, it means I find you attractive but would never date you. it's like the "fuck zone"\n\nSo, my advice to you is: be patient. Keep on seeing the people you like spending time with, build that connection. And when you meet someone who matches you well and start being their friend, something will innevitably happen and you two will date.\n\n... Unless your problem is that because you speak to everyone and seem excited to talkk to everyone equally, girls never have the feeling that they are "special" to you ?
3	You're not in any kind of zone, these chicks aren't attracted to you.

8	Unrequited feelings - next step?	Hello fellow ENFJs\n\nI have been friends with an ENFP girl in my college for almost 2 years now and it was only last year that I developed very heavy feelings for her. Because I understood that I fall for people easily, I gave myself time to see if this was just a brief infatuation or actual feelings. It was definitely feelings and that too, I have never fallen for anyone harder. It was my mistake to hold these feelings in for so long until now but I feel the need to confess them to her for my own sake.\n\nThis being said, I'm worried about how she will respond. For the last couple months, I've been trying to get over these feelings and move on from her because I've sacrificed so much time and energy with her. I know for sure that she doesn't have the same romantic feelings for me but I just feel that I will regret it if I don't say anything. At the same time, I don't know what action I should take if she doesn't reciprocate.\n\nThere are some people I know who say to cut off ties if she doesn't reciprocate because of self-respect and not getting dragged along. The two of us have been very close emotionally and helped each other through difficult times in the past so it would be a difficult but (maybe) necessary path to walk if things don't work in my favor. We're part of the same tight friend group as well and see each other on a daily basis so I hope I have the strength to be true to myself should things not go my way romantically with her.\n\nThat's why I thought I'd ask you all. Any thoughts on the action I should take in confessing and what to do if they aren't reciprocated? Have any of you been in these kind of situations when it comes to one-sided feelings? If so, what advice can you offer?\n\nThank you for reading!\n\nTL;DR: Close friends with an ENFP. Want to confess my romantic feelings to her but unsure about how to proceed if it doesn't go well
7	I know this is uncommon coming from an ENFJ, maybe seems harsh too but you might want to consider this. Falling in love is a decision. I've went through that phase 'cant stop thinking about him/her', 'keep dreaming of her' every single second but I kept telling myself to forget about it. I don't deny what I'm experiencing but nobody should say I'm falling in love until I decide so. You said it yourself, you fall easily. It's probably time to learn how to control what you feel instead of confessing here and there regardless of the feelings intensity.
7	Hey, guy ENFP here. Our biggest crux when it comes to deciding a romantic partner is that it’s really hard for us to figure out how we feel or what we want. It’s almost like our deepest core feelings about someone are buried under all the clutter in our mind. \n\nOne thing about ENFP’s is that they really appreciate direct blunt honest truth, followed by supportive reassurance. A massive turnoff for me is whenever people beat around the bush / hide how they feel, because I can see right through it. \n\nAt the same time, if I do receive blunt news, my brain goes into hyperdrive, coming up with a million different explanations/interpretations/possible ways to go about it, and it gets really overwhelming because I’m so uncertain about A. How I really feel, B. What I should do, or C. If I’m being a burden to others or not (in this case, leading that person on without meaning to) \n\nSo I’d recommend directly telling us (no hinting at it, just speak from your heart) followed by creating a safe, comfortable, and stress free environment for us to figure things out and talk out how we feel, without pressure of giving an answer right away or any expectations. \n\nMagic words: “No matter what you decide, I’ll still be there for you. I just wanted to get this off my chest.” (Paraphrase however you’d like)\n\nThis is what has worked in my experience, can’t speak for other ENFP’s. Every one of us is so different lol
2	> This being said, I'm worried about how she will respond. For the last couple months, I've been trying to get over these feelings and move on from her because I've sacrificed so much time and energy with her. I know for sure that she doesn't have the same romantic feelings for me but I just feel that I will regret it if I don't say anything. At the same time, I don't know what action I should take if she doesn't reciprocate.\n\n...this is actually a problem on a number of levels because I've been here too. Let me explain.  \n...You need to let her know how you feel, but *don't expect it to go your way*. It'll clear the air between you two. If it goes well, great!  If not, you need to move on but you can still be friends. **DO NOT** beat yourself up over the time you think you've wasted or use that as an excuse to make them love you because that's actually being selfish and it's unfair to them with that kind of expectation as they will recent feeling obligated to a take a step they never wanted and things could go south real fast.  \n...you can't *make* someone love you, it has to be *given* by them and believe or not you *can* still become great friends; this is exactly what happened to me. She didn't want me the way I wanted her but you know what? That's ok. She's now like a sister and I, her brother and we have a great relationship.  \n...my point is, don't beat yourself up for something you *can't* control. There *is* someone out there for you and it's your job to find that person.  \n...don't rush into anything and just let things happen organically and naturally and you'll be much better off for it in the long run, trust me, I've been on that road myself :)  \n...good luck!
2	Okay, first off: How do you know for sure she isn't interested in you romantically if you haven't said anything to her? I am also an ENFP girl in her twenties and let me tell you sometimes we don't know how someone really feels about us unless you tell us point blank because are heads are off in the clouds. Personally, I find myself constantly thinking about could be's and that seems to be something that is shared by ENFPs. If you've been this close to her for that long, I suggest just being frank with her while letting her know there's no pressure on her. If anything she will worry how her response will affect your friendship. If the answer isn't what you hope for, I won't lie for your own sanity you will have to create distance but that doesn't necessarily mean cut her out of your life, especially if you have the same circle of friends. I have been where you are before and I won't lie it sucks but the best thing to do is get your feelings out there, process them and, if you have to, let go. You seem like a very sweet guy do don't worry, this is just a bump in the road on what I'm sure will be great journey. (Please excuse all the cheese :P)
2	If I was in your shoes, I would probably say something like, "This is really difficult for me to confess, but I have romantic feelings for you and I'm having trouble being close friends right now. I'd love to date you but I'm pretty certain you don't feel the same way, so I might need some distance and time apart to move on. I still want to stay in touch and continue being friends in the long run, if possible, though I understand if you wouldn't feel comfortable with that." \n\nI would also recommend this article: [Unrequited Love for a Friend? Here Are 6 Ways to Deal](https://everydayfeminism.com/2016/01/dealing-with-unrequited-love/)
15	Fellow ENFJs, what's your career? do you enjoy it?	Fellow ENFJs, I have a couple of questions to ask regarding your career. \n\n\n\n\nFor some context as to why I'm asking this question. I'm 24, and just quit my marketing job 5 months ago. I wasn't enjoying it anymore and felt depressed being in a field that was very marketing/sales focused and didn't really benefit society. Now I didn't *hate* it per se, but I think there's so much more out there. Problem is....I don't know what. So here I am unemployed, and it's been really hard for me to make actionable decisions or even take steps in the right direction because I don't know what to do. The past few months have been me having a lot of anxiety about the future, my happiness, the fact that we aren't immortal, etc.     \n\n\n\nSo a few questions, if you could answer them, that'd be great!\n\n\n-What career are you in?\n\n\n-Do you enjoy it? Why or why not?\n\n\n-Do you consider your career a part of you or just a means to make a paycheck?\n\n\n-Does your career match your ENFJ profile?
9	I'm a high school teacher. There is an upside and a downside to that. \n\nI'll start with the downside because I like to end on a positive note. It's a very stressful and difficult job. It's a shit ton of work, and can be very demanding on your mental and physical health. You spend a ton of your own money just on stuff for your job and you never actually stop working, even on weekends, even during the summer. Teaching is more of a lifestyle than a job. Depending on where you work, your pay can be very shitty and you can have very few rights. You also have to deal with the general public shit talking teachers and the school system all the time, basically it's a scapegoat for everything.\n\nNow, in my opinion, the upside outweighs the downside and there is no other job I would rather be doing. I love my students like they're my own kids and I look forward to seeing them every day. They see the world a different way than I do, and I learn a lot from them. Its so great to see how much they grow just over the course of a semester and to know you helped them get there. I also love to share my passion for my subject (music) and getting kids as excited about it as I am. I love getting to be in charge of what I do most of the time - I do have to follow provincial curriculum and school rules, but the actual activities we do are up to me. It's a great creative outlet, no matter what you teach. When you're a teacher, your co-workers tend to be awesome. As a helping profession, teachers look out for one another and offer a lot of support to each other. I also love all the fun stuff that comes with being a teacher - going to talent shows and sports games and stuff like that.\n\nDo I feel like it's more than just a job? Absolutely. I am in a position to be a positive force during one of the most difficult phases of a person's life. That's what I feel I am meant to do with my time on this planet.
8	1) I work in composition (writing instruction) in higher education. I've been adjuncting in this capacity for 3 years and just became the assistant director of a university writing center.\n\n2) I love teaching with my whole soul. Like, if I had to pick between my husband and teaching, it'd be teaching (which he knows and thinks is commendable!) The ability to encourage and positively impact young people is so important to me, and to the good of humanity. I get to challenge and cheerlead to my heart's content, knowing that my students are doing amazing things. It's satisfying, not to mention a blast. \n\n3) My teaching is absolutely a part of my identity. When I realized I should be a teacher, it was like everything in my life suddenly made sense: my love of school, my "teacher's pet" personality, my special skill at getting along with everyone, coaching people, and explaining things, etc. I can't imagine what I'd do if I didn't teach.\n\nAt the same time, I feel strongly that people shouldn't do what they're good at for free. The idea that teachers should accept low pay and little respect because "they do it for the love of the children" is utter bullshit. Do doctors get paid nothing because they love healing? I work hard at what I do and I'm very good at it, so I've fought (and still fight) for proper compensation. So, while work isn't just a paycheck to me, of course a paycheck is a part of it! I've also done less desirable work (tutoring for rich asshole families, for example) so I could afford to do teaching I love at a community college.\n\n4) Many ENFJ profile descriptions name our type the teacher or coach, so I think my job fits my type for sure! But I've always felt I'm an ENFJ through and through, and I may be a bit special (everyone in my family has been a teacher of some sort, so maybe it's in my blood?) \n\nI suspect that an ENFJ will have a hard time devoting their career to something impersonal that doesn't improve humanity. I'm sorry you're having a rough time right now, but I want you to know that what you're experiencing is very normal. The "right" way to figure out what you want to do with yourself is to go around making mistakes until you find stuff that feels right. I've made tons of mistakes, and will make more, too! And it's all been cool to learn from.\n\nI was unemployed when I realized I should get into teaching. I volunteered with the 826 organization, and facilitating a creative writing exercise with students gave me the lightning-strike moment that teaching could be my thing. Are there volunteer organizations in your area you could hook up with?\n\nYou might also think about what you were passionate about in college, or even in childhood. Or maybe there was something about marketing that initially drew you to it, but later faded. \n\n
5	I'm in software development. \n\nI enjoy problem solving in general, but I don't enjoy my work much, mainly because I'm an outcast in community. \n\nI'm social and can't stay focused for more than 30 minutes (but I do work way more efficiently than my peers when I'm in the zone). \n\nI hate to say it, but my career is for the paycheck. \n\nAs you've probably guessed, no it does not one bit haha
3	I work in HR. I do really enjoy it, it appeals to my admin/organisational freak but also the part of me that loves to help and support others. It's definitely my career -  I'm 24 and have been doing this for 4 years and I'm now qualified, & I have hopes of making it to Management/Director level in 5-10 yrs. It pays well the more senior you get, which is a perk. I think HR was actually a career suggested in the test, but I was already 3 years into my career when I took the test.
3	I’m getting my masters in health administration and am pursuing an executive position at a health system in the future. \n\nHOWEVER— I took a career test five years ago at school and they said I should be a teacher with my personality. That really came off as a shock because I never thought of it before. The next year I had the opportunity to teach a few students English for a class credit and it was the most fun experience ever. My students said that I was the best and most passionate teacher they had. (My students were 30+) I taught one guy who spoke two words of English how to order pizza and he was the happiest guy that day. I really felt rewarded and I think that most people here will be in teacher or teacher-like positions because our personalities compliment that position. I’m glad to hear that experience but also I’m glad to move towards my path. \n\nI’m considering getting my PhD in maybe six years down the road and teach for a bit. 
3	First, thank you for this post. It's probably one of the most relevant posts to my [34F] life that I have seen in this sub.\n\nWhen I was 16 I took the full version of the test and was typed as ENFJ. I have taken the online test since then and my type has not changed. The description for ENFJ truly resonates with me.\n\nI think I lacked self-awareness until only a few years ago - a light bulb clicked one day. I didn't take the advice given when I was 16 to pursue a career in public service, politics or teaching. I studied chemistry and worked in laboratories as a chemist, client services rep (this job rocked!) and quality control. I worked the QC job for two years and found the position rewarding and purposeful. *However, it did not allow for personal/professional growth and the schedule our team worked was very difficult.* I had a breaking point and left the position in November without having another job lined up. \n\nWhile unemployed I had time to carefully consider what I wanted the next stage of my life to look like. I narrowed down my interests to dental hygiene, getting a master's... or teaching. :)\n\nTeaching made the most sense (and will provide easier opportunities for the master's) and in early June I accepted a position as a middle school science teacher with a socially/emotionally challenged student population. As an ENFJ I find this appealing and rewarding. Even tho I am aware of how hard this first year will be (I have no formal experience and am entering the alternative path CO offers), I do not feel overwhelmed and I feel like I have more purpose and direction than ever. I don't necessarily buy into the idea that you should "follow your passion" in making career choices, but I do buy into doing what fits your personality strengths and weaknesses. *To me, this means a position that allows for movement and growth.* *If I had one revelation to share with you, that is it.* I have done a fair bit of volunteering, instructing and training and I have confidence that I can learn to become an effective teacher. I do tend to see a career as part of me and usually make RL friends from where I work. I have a hard time compartmentalizing my job from me.\n\nI find it oh so interesting that you brought up anxiety over the future and mortality, specifically. The idea of mortality troubles me, too, and I'm not sure if that's just because it's a human experience or because death doesn't fit in with ENFJ plans to optimize and organize the hell out of everything we touch. Mortality can't be predicted or organized. It may make sense that ENFJ's are more so troubled with ideas of mortality because our brains are future-geared and this is part of our (hopefully distant) future. What do you think?\n\nDon't be too discouraged and try not to let the future overwhelm you and hinder your choices you make today. Enjoy and optimize all that you are given. \n\nPlease keep us posted on insight that you get during your unemployment process. \n\n
3	1. I am currently a full-time psychology student, a barista, a suicide hotline worker, and an assistant as a mindfulness research lab. My end goal is to earn my master's & to be a Marriage and Family Therapist and work with younger populations, couples, and families who are struggling with trauma, poverty, and substance use disorders. 😊🌻\n\n2. I enjoy all the things I'm doing right now-- probably being a barista the least (only because it is physically taxing and I barely make enough $) BUT I have several regular customers who come in just to say hi to me. It allows me to be social and make friends with the guests. It makes me feel liked and allows me to be warm and spend time sitting with people and keeping them company when the store isn't busy. :)\n\nThe hotline is the most rewarding thing I'm doing right now. I don't get paid for it, it's just something I LOVE doing. I find it very comforting  when people are vulnerable with me and allow me to help them through their problems. I think I have a knack for seeing the strengths in people that they don't even notice in themselves. I try my best to help them realize that these strengths and use them to their advantage. I get so much satisfaction when I hear a worried caller ease up,  begin to laugh, and tell me that I helped them feel a lot better. It's rewarding as **FUCK.** \n\n3. I absolutely see my career path as a part of myself and not just a paycheck. All of my jobs have consistently involved the need to be empathetic, social, and tolerant. I think that's why Marriage and Family therapy is the perfect fit for me-- it is a culmination of all of my raw talents. Even when I earn my master's and licensure, I will never stop learning and growing.\n\n4. I would say so, yes :) \n\nEdit: I'm on my phone and I have NO IDEA what went on with the formatting. Pls forgive I'm going in to work & I don't have time to fix :(
3	CEO in my own company and yes I enjoy it. I was the classic ENFJ ; want to become a teacher, psychologist and I've been told countless times that I should pursue them. But I learned the hard way that not everybody is going to appreciate that and I'm starting to get less interested in those fields. I choose business because I was a sale agent a few years before. As a gamer I find business to be very rewarding. The score is achieving your goal and money that you can use for charity and such. The product itself is very useful. I feel I've added value in people life through business.\n\nI personally think this career is exhausting for ENFJs as it requires us to be more objective and logical but I develop high Te too as my experience grow. And the typical persuasive ENFJ gives me a bunch of advantage like getting a ton of free services from outside (that cost like thousand dollars), negotiating with supplier, inspire and motivate my employees etc etc. Their smile when they look at me is a gift. People getting inspired from my achievement is also a gift. I'm satisfied from my work. I consider it as a part of me though I'll have to delegate my position at some point and get some rest. Does my career match ENFJ profile? Not really I guess except the leading role part and inspire people, but it probably does with my enneagram 3. p/s : excuse my grammar, not a native speaker
2	I work as an English teacher! Also going to begin a degree in English & Psychology in September. 
2	This will be short because I’m on my phone but I like this question and conversation. \n\n29 male ENFJ\n\nI work in logistics and have been at my current job for about 6 years. Since I work for a publicly trade company and I see everyday how my company takes advantage of smaller companies, drivers, employees, ect. all to make the bottom line better so that eats at my soul. \n\nPluses I get to talk to all types of people from all around the country and have actually made what I consider friends with some of my carrier customers. That and it’s laid back environment and very competitive so while money doesn’t really matter to me, I found that I’m good at it and moved up quick. \n\nThat really allowed me to open up and start getting into recruiting (even though I don’t really like the company), hiring process, and the training of all our new reps. When I can see someone I trained go out and have success is the biggest accomplishment for me. \n\nNegatives.  Stress all the time. Always what have you done for me lately. Tons of scrutiny on your every move because 1000’s of dollars are on every phone call I take and I’m normally on the phone for 6 hours a day so I always come home drained \n\nHoped this helped get some perspective from someone who’s got the same questions you do. Good luck and remember that even if you don’t find your dream job you are smart enough to figure out where you can be of most use doing some good anywhere you end up!
2	Yo - congrats on quitting your job! Noting when you're not happy is really important for ENFJs, and taking steps to improve your happiness is HUGE. My advice is to list what you liked about your job (what gave you energy, happiness, and satisfaction) and consider if there's a pattern. Are those things you've done or liked in other jobs? What are other jobs that might involve some of those same likes or inspirations? \n\nFellow ENFJ here. I always thought I was an ENFP, but I toe the line between feeling and thinking, which made me doubt the validity of the ENFP. After doing research, I'm pretty damn sure my mistake was just that I'm actually an ENFJ. Things make more sense now, but I'm not happy about it by any means. I think I value a lot of traits found in the ENFP profile, but I'm a true service-driven individual. \n\nI've always worked in the service industry in some way, but it's just not stimulating enough for me... and it's too inauthentic. I somehow found my way into Office Management, and from there, I started working as a recruiter. It's by no means a career, but I could see parts of what I do as a recruiter lending themselves to a career in HR. Totally. This job in particular, however, is just a means to an end. I feel anxious about the future a lot of the time, especially when I think about all the things I want to do, and all the things I want to be (we're idealists... it's what we do...) and since I'm naturally passive and don't take time for myself, I actively have to work on making time to think about what I want and what I need - and take steps to pursue what makes me feel good.\n\nI love parts of what I do in talent management - I love helping people, counseling and supporting candidates, evaluating talent, the client services aspect of working with a client, etc etc. The crappy part is the time management - and things are so transient. You have just enough time to start a relationship with someone before things change, and there's no lasting connection. \n\nI'm currently pursuing next steps myself. Remember - there are no wrong steps. Just try out new things until you find what lights that fire in you. Just surround yourself with people and explore your options - you don't have to have it all figured out right now! You might find that what inspires you the most is not a job, but a hobby, or someone special to share and experience life with.\n\n I'll be following to see what you end up doing! 
2	19 years old, male, I’m a marine.\n\nI personally love/hate a lot of it, but overall, I would not have done it any differently. I work in intelligence and I love my work. I love being a marine, part of something vastly greater than myself, and a rich history, something I connect to my stepdad and others with on a deeper level than I knew existed.\n\nThroughout the process of training I discovered that everything you thought was impossible to do can in fact be done if you do it for someone else. Because of this, I excelled.\n\nThe downsides are it’s quite strict and you see many marines get hit heavy punishments with trivial issues such as underage drinking, speeding, etc. that stems from a chain of command that is often impersonal towards its marines. The institution sucks, as per usual. The pay is terrible, especially for a junior marine with a car and phone bill to pay. I have gone hungry before but people I’ve helped before have always stepped in. The benefits are amazing though, and free college is hard to come by so, another thought. As well as free healthcare and marriage benefits.\n\nWhat I like about it the most is that we’re all in this together, to do it for each other, and for a set of ideals. While other branches might look for those seeking employment, the marines seek those who are seeking something more. It’s been intense. My best and worst moments have been over the past 8 or 9 months. But the chills I got when I earned that title are something I will always get when I hear the hymn.\n\nMoral of the story is, embrace the suck, the worst days are actually the best, have each others back, and do something more. It fits that passion to serve people for sure, and it fills my needs personality wise. Making sure my guys are good, being held to a higher standard, and doing something good for the world is something you seldom find anymore in the business sector.\n\nIt’s a drastic decision, yes, but to have something you’ve never had, you have to do something you’ve never done.
1	No career, wasn't expecting to live this long. 29 years old seems absurdly old for me to have survived to. Its pretty up in the air if I see 30.

1	Hi! ENFJ here living in Reno!
1	Hi! ENFJ here. I'm from New Orleans, LA 
1	Hi, how are you? I am an ENFJ who lives 40minutes-1 hour from you! The world can seem so small on Reddit. Why do you call yourself a memelord? Do you make them? 
1	Ello matey. Welcome. I just join this subreddit. I’m from San Diego. If you ever want to chat just pm me and we can find what works best to talk on 😋
1	Why
14	Never Feeling a Sense of Belonging with Groups or Communities	As I've grown into adulthood, I've sadly come to the realization that I have never felt like I've ever truly belonged to a group or community. The most glaring evidence for this being that legitimately no one stays in touch after I've moved away, despite best efforts to maintain it on my end. The most recent being an old church community in the US, of which I was intermittently a part of for 3 years (due to college).\n\n\n**The more I think about it, the more I realize that in hindsight, I was never a part of the core "in-group." Despite people saying that they valued me as a member of the community that I've always just been on the outside looking in.**\n\n\nHas anyone else ever struggled with this? If this is something that's common for us, will it always be like this?
9	I struggle with this, but I think for maybe the opposite reasons - I find attempting to stay in contact over long distances is a very draining process (I'd liken it to when Persephone gives Tantalus a mouthful of the water he can never reach, and though he thanks her - it only makes him more thirsty/needy for the water he can't reach). The little interaction I can get from texts or Facebook messages is so much less than is desired as an ENFJ, that I come away always wanting more.\n\nI think it's also a fairly common phenomena in modern society because we haven't 'built in' structures to allow the greater level of socialization that's the more natural state for ENFJ. It's hugely underappreciated in our societies, and between finding enough time to facilitate friendships is going to be an uphill battle until we tackle this on a systemic level (IMO). Everyone is kept so busy busy and stressed stressed stressed that it's hard to keep in touch over time.\n\nMy recommendation is typically to embrace a 'variety of experience' attitude towards life. The best method I've found is tabletop role playing games - they can be played remotely (though I'd start out in-person) and are a perfect excuse to engage socially with others over a longer period of time (and get out of the 'So what's up with you. Nothing.' 'What's up with you.' Nothing' trap). My brother has always been a storyteller and we've kept a crew together for over 16 years with some regularity. We don't always agree, but I know I belong.\n\nIf that doesn't grab you - try something else out. Ideally many things! Acroyoga or dance classes are great if you're lacking nonsexual physical touch (another thing we devalue in our societies that is vitally important to generating a sense of belonging). Sculpture/ceramics is also very therapeutic. There will be many you do not connect with when trying disparate activities, but this is not a failure - everyone isn't for everyone.\n\nDon't stay focused on the past or those missed / old connections, as that's a recipe for madness. Variety of experience is the best cure for all ENFJ problems because really as a socially-focused type every new, unique individual you meet with will naturally refine your understanding of the human condition and capability to engage at an endlessly greater level with those around you.

1	What do you mean by no one stays in touch, like nobody text with you first? I wish to understand you more. For me, I don't struggle with this because ;\n\n* People continuously need my help. They always do. I made it such a way that when people are in trouble they've no where else to go except me, even when all they need is just a listener. But more often than not, they need my suggestion the most. Of course there are many I call it, 'shallow friendship' and they don't contact me anymore. But I move on. It's not a true friendship to begin with but I'm glad I was part of their lives and had a little contribution in it in the past. To me when I start to get involved in a community I make sure my presence is noticeable, I make sure people will miss and yearn to meet me.\n* My religion teacher always remember me. I've some sort of vow or thing like that we did in our group so I know this bond is more than just a mere 'between worshippers'. It's a bond between a teacher and student, and the group that have a strong chains with previous ancestors. It's a worldwide group so my teachers and some students don't even live in the same country but we come off having strong bond regardless of where we live. We've met few times in real life. Also I've to contact him at least once a week.\n\nThere are a lot more but I'll cut the chase. I don't normally feel a true sense of belonging to avoid disappointment (and after all it's only God that matters the most to me), but I know giving a lot contributions in people's im/personal life has a lot of effect. If you want to feel the belonging make sure you worth it. I'm not saying you don't because I don't know your efforts, but that's all I've got to say. I don't like doing yoga or dance class like the above user said, that is **not me**. The real me? Deep connection with people. The satisfaction of seeing people smile, laugh and helping to solve their problem be it through advising or lending money. Disappointment is normal, but what we do after has a lot more to tell.
52	Your soulmate is out there	A loving letter to ENFJs  \n \n\nI’m an INFP, and the subject of soulmates and love has been on my mind a lot lately.\n\nI looked into it, and MBTI theory suggests our types are a true match. All the things I read about you guys and even the friendliness on this subreddit, it's all so nice, almost too good to be true. \n\nThe way they’re portrayed, these two types, if they were to share the same values, would be unstoppable in their quest-  not to rule over people, but to conquer over darkness and loss with life-affirming, life enhancing beliefs. \n\nTo defend, to lead and build something great, to protect and exuberate good faith, humility, objectivity, reason, passion, courage, kindness and compassion.\n\nTo promote empathy, freedom, honesty and altruism.\n\nTo inspire faith and passion in each other, refuge from the outside world, and to constantly want to help each other improve.\n\nTo share everything, to inspire and motivate others to join or help a noble cause, to mediate conflicts and enable people to work together.\n\nTo build a beautiful, strong family, an open, safe environment.\n\nTo infuse every aspect or existence with restless joy and beauty, to celebrate nature, life and ideals, to go on adventures, travel, meet people and discover new things.\n\nThe INFP would validate, praise and assure the ENFJ, always by their side, taming their negative emotions with devoted trust, to remind them of their self-worth, to anchor them and keep the greater cause in mind.\n\nThe ENFJ would encourage the INFP in times of trouble, help remove some of the pressure they put on themselves; offer them some order and practicality and admire and revel in their rich inner worlds.\n\nIntuitive, helpful, dependable friends, caring and devoted lovers, and such great parents.\n\nIt sounds like such a pure, harmonious and productive alliance. An understanding, freeing, real love.\n\nSo I guess all we have to do is be true to who we are, put ourselves out there, truly see and be seen.\n\nI thought I’d share all this, in case anyone feels the same way.  \n \n\nYour soul bud is out there.  \n All the luv.
14	Thanks for the lovely read. I definitely align with these goals/aspirations.\n\nI don't think you were directly suggesting this, but I generally advise against limiting yourself to pursuing or being open to relationships to only one MBTI type. Variety of experience is the best way to learn about yourself and others to the point of identifying and cultivating a permanent match. Type matches are great on paper, but people are just much more complicated than that.  There's likely as many ENFJs that wouldn't match due to unrelated human complications as there are other types (that have cultivated the appropriate auxiliary functions) who would be a perfect match. I'm sure we all appreciate the love though. Right back atcha :)
9	> Your soulmate is out there\n\nVery true. Though I'm an INFJ, my ENFJ believed she would never be loved by anyone, but still kept giving all she had to everyone around her. That... that made me burst into tears. You ENFJs are always so loving, giving, caring. Today, I care for her, love her, protect her and make her feel safe and that's the most satisfying part of my life. There's someone out there for all you lovelies too.
5	My husband is an INFP, I've been with him for almost 9 years. Definitely can say that we compliment each others personalities perfectly. He makes me more adventurous and I keep our feet from flying too far off the ground. We can share anything with each other and he truely is my best friend.
3	Lost mine twice. Will have to settle someday to get the children I want. Good luck to the rest of you tho!
3	One of my most best best best friends is an INFP. Though we're not a soulmate in the romantic sense, I do feel like she is a soulmate of mine. There are few people in the world who I enjoy long conversations with more. Luckily, she and my very much romantic INTP fiance soulmate get along like best buds! This was a beautiful read. Thank you for your kind words <3
4	This was a nice read. I was talking to one of my friends who said that there's supposed to be 8 people in the world who are our potential soulmates and in our lifetime, we would be able to meet those people.\n\nThere's not one single soulmate as we are compatible with many people in general. It was an interesting thought 
2	This was so refreshing. Thank you!
2	Your words, ideas, principles, beliefs and your writing is exceptionally beautiful. ‘Twas a good read as everyone else said. I’m not sure what type of personality would be best for me, but being open to explore this world with me is one thing that I look for. 
1	what "MBTI" theory is this?
2	ENFJ Cognitive Orientation Guidebook	
6	Best friend, Best friend me not...	Do people claim you as their best friend and you wonder why because they know nothing about you?\n\nI feel a bit resentful when this happens because typically the person has not made any effort to truly get to know me and this makes me see them as selfish. On the other hand, I understand that perhaps my social norms were soaked up by a person with low self esteem and they interpreted my kindness as an intent for strong friendship.\n\nI don't know how to go about this because my heart crumbles every time they claim me as their best friend because the true me doesn't even like them and I don't have skills to confront this.
4	Are you an ENFJ? I feel proud if they call me best friend ^((and neutral if they don't)) even if I don't consider them the same way. Most people don't know the real me because I'm quite deep inside (high Ni, Ti and Fi). I've a lot of things to think and say but they can't fathom it anyway. They aren't trained or not used to understand such thing and I don't expect them to be able to do so.  I don't see them as selfish people though. So far, regardless of thousands of close friends I made there are only 3-5 best friends. They're mainly INXX and ENFP. Another thing is, I don't expect much things in return from other people. For me kindness isn't a business, people shouldn't be obliged to pay something in exchange of my kindness. If I dislike them I'll just ditch or put some distant. Maybe you can learn to be more confrontational, make more friends and filter them. Be proud of who you're and progress into the real person you want to be. ENFJ-A 3w2

2	> *Do people claim you as their best friend and you wonder why because they know nothing about you?* \n\nYes, quite often! Many tend to claim me as their best friend or close friend even though they evidently don't really know me at all. I can't blame them though since I put on different masks around different people.\n\nTo my knowledge, ENFJ's kindness can often be interpreted as an intent for strong friendship. My ENTP sister told me before that I have a habit of doing things most people wouldn't do when they're not friends or want to be friends with someone so people would misinterpret my intention.\n\nI believe everyone has different methods in dealing with things. For me, if I don't like the people who claim me as their best friend, I think hard about why I don't like them and whether that's reasonable enough for me to stop being friends with them. \n\nAt the same time, If I feel like I'm being taken advantage of or the other party isn't putting in as much effort, I'd just try to not give them my 100&#37; and see if there's any changes. From this, some times I realize that people actually put in more effort than I previously thought and some other times I realize that some people aren't just worth staying with. For the latter group, a confrontation isn't usually needed because these people would just leave on their own.\n\nI know it really sucks to feel like that so I hope this helps you in some way. Stay strong, fellow ENFJ!

1	I teared up. Thanks a lot for sharing
1	ENFJ here. I saw this a few years ago and couldn’t remember the name of it. I think about it pretty often — once every few weeks. I finally went a movie alone for the first time last weekend. It was so nice, I’ll think I’ll do it again. Spent most of the day alone today and I didn’t feel lonely until I was on social media. I spend so much time with other people giving and pouring into them that it’s not until I’m alone and doing what I want that I feel like “wow it’s good to be in my own company.” 
7	ENFJ - The Veteran	
33	I have been feeling down lately but looking at posts here is helping me understand that y'all go through exactly what i do.	It truly is comforting to have you guys around and I am happy to have found this subreddit. I couldn't pinpoint why I was crying a lot for the past few weeks. I found my answer here. I am learning more about myself then I thought I would and am understanding why I am feeling so drained lately. I need to take care of my mental health more because I have been so focused on others. All of the top posts \n of all time are literally like someone is writing about me haha! \nThank you for reading
12	Agreed! These past few months have been very difficult for me personally. I've been feeling frustrated, hopeless, uncertain, and tremendously sad about my direction in life. During the worst times, I come to this subreddit and realize how great people are and how they are always willing to help.\n\nSeeing this makes me realize my own qualities and gives me a drive to remember my strengths and capitalize on them. Thanks for sharing this thought OP
6	Right there with you. I've been going through a rough couple of months with anxiety and depression and this subreddit has been such a comfort. 
6	First time I comment here and I need to say that I totally agree with you. Since I discovered I'm an ENFJ and this subreddit, reading you guys has helped me a lot to understand and accept myself in a way I have never did before. I think that caring about others is something in the core of our personality, and I feel like I'm at a high peak of caring about people right now, while I'm not at my best moment. Thanks for reminding me to take care of myself and I hope your situation improves soon! ❤
5	I think in the end, being a type that's focused on others is always going to be a stressful path because people are imperfect, our ability to communicate our intention is imperfect, their ability to read our intention and relay their own intention is imperfect.. So there's just a lot of room for misunderstanding that we'll take hard until we learn to roll with the punches. \n\nKeep at it sister , take the time and effort to get right int he world and keep building your place in it. I'm also thankful for this community and comforted by posts that remind me of my own struggles.\n\nEdit: fixed misgendered
2	I completely agree with you. I'm very new to mbti and because of this sub I am not only feeling like I am really getting to know myself for the first time, I am also learning how to handle certain situations, how to take care of myself and generally, how to be a better version of me.\n\nI am so happy I discovered you guys and I can't wait to see what the future will bring. <3
11	Adopt an intp?	I'm not 100% on whether this is allowed. Idk. \n\nI already feel like I sound pathetic so I'll keep it short. I don't have a lot of friends, I'm trying to move out of a self destructive cycle, and I feel like an enfj could really be the positive force I might need to help me stay motivated. Send me a message if you'd like to adopt an intp friend. 
6	can u elaborate? how are we helpful exactly? Im curious to know
1	Hey you! I’m not sure if anyone messaged you but I hope you are able to cheer up. It doesn’t sound like you’re having a great time right now but know that it always gets better. Focus on self improvement activities because everyone has room to improve and be a better version of themselves. That thing that you’ve always wanted to try, go for it! Another piece of advice is wear your favorite outfit, have good hygiene, and trim your beard if you have one. When you feel better on the outside, it can help for the inside too! Always start your day with a smile. \n\nI’m not sure if people here want to add more people to take on baggage and listen to (because it can be exhausting if I’m honest). Check out some other posts here. But feel free to post when you’re feeling down or specific things and I’ll try to take time to write out some words of encouragement! 
1	Hey, I'd love to adopt you as an intp friend! Just message me anytime:)
3	(INFP) Found a ENFJ that i find really interesting but i don't think he's interested in me.	For the first time I found a ENFJ; and first let me tell you, you are really interesting people. That's rare for the little we talked to have someone making me laugh, have interesting discussion and also with who I feel like I can be listened to ! But recently we've been talking less and less; I know he's been busy with work but I'm scared that he will stop talking to me/ forget about me.\n\nHow do ENFJ show that they are/aren't interested in someone ? \nIf I talk to him even more will he think that I'm a creep ? \nIs it just me overthinking about him ?\n\nPS: Sorry if my English isn't perfect I'm french :p also talking about it and knowing that people will hear me makes me feel better so thank you to be here for me :)
4	I am female, so might be a little different. But I show I am interested by checking on them. I'll ask them how they are doing and not just for small talk, I'll mean it. Or I'll check up on something else, like if they mentioned they has anxiety the other day.\n\nWhere does he spend most of his energy? If he is passionate about work, ask him about it and get him going on his feelings related to it -- how does he feel about his work environment and co-workers, are tasks getting accomplished? 
2	Guy here.\n\nMost ENFJs are nice people and they are pretty reciprocated.\n\nWhen is someone not interested?\n\nWell if one is not interested in you they will simply just ignore you or reduce the contact with you.\n\nHe won't as long as you present a normal attitude, how you socialize with every other. Yes overthinking means you like him.
2	Find that topic that excites them! I had a few topics I’d get super excited about and ramble about like my school and hobbies. See what kind of interests they have and give them a try as well! \n\nMy SO wasn’t too into gaming but once he found it was a hobby of mine, he bought a whole gaming laptop to spend more time with me. I won’t ever forget it because it’s one of the nicest gestures he’s done for me. Acts of kindness are really sweet if you’re into that kind of thing! 
4	How to help a sad ENFJ	My best friend is ENFJ, and I can tell she’s sad rn. She just isn’t her usual self. It pains me to see. Unfortunately, being an INTP, Fe is my weakest function and I have no idea how to handle this. She *always* helps me feel better, but now that it’s time for me to do the same, I have no idea how. \n\nPlease help! 
17	Words of affirmation can be really helpful to an ENFJ. So 1. listen to her rant. 2. agree that her problems are legitimate and unfortunate and that you are sorry for her. and 3. compliment her on her strengths and how she is a great friend.\n\nEx: "Hey ENFJ, I'm really sorry that -said bad thing- happened and I'm sure it's really tough on you, which sucks. I just wanted to say that you have always been there for me and are a really good friend. Let me know, if there's anything I can do to help" \n\nYou don't have to say this exactly but it's a good example of the kind of thing that might make her feel better. 
2	Have you thought about going on a hike together? Usually lost in depression and sadness is that sense of adventure, a connection to nature and others, and exercise which in general should naturally lift the spirits. If you go to a peak, that will probably be best because standing at the top of a mountain, you’re so far away from others and your problems that it could be just what’s needed to put things into perspective, allowing her a good environment to think about her issues and vent in private. You’ll have plenty of time to listen and allow her to come to her own conclusions. This should also inspire her to become more social and reconnect. 
2	You are a good friend just by reaching out. Thoughtful surprises of things my friends know I love (like comfort food) always cheer me up to know my friend cares and has been paying attention and also comfortable silence just being together.
2	My best friend is an INTP and when I was in a downer situation he'd usually suggest something stupid to mix it up. He'd never out right mention the fact I was in a down mood or something, but he 'd pick up on it. Then out of no where when he had a day off from work he'd hit me up\n\n"Hey, want to come over and do the Star Wars drinking game?"\n\n  Me: "Really?"   \n\n"Yeah why not?"   \n\nStar Wars, beer, and a day with my best friend?  Ok this works. \n\nSo just kind of think about what your best friend really likes to do, in a low key way (Don't go full blast night on the town kind of thing) and spend a day together.  
2	5000 miles away - just reach out. FaceTime her some night and laugh about something. If you don't know what to chat about, plan a movie night and play something at the same time. It's okay to tell her you know she is sad, you're a real friend for noticing and wanting to help. 
2	Kind of like the previous comments suggested. I have two ENFJ best friends, one of them prefers comfort food so when she's down, I'd either take her out to eat or surprise her with her favourite snacks, while the other prefers word of affirmation so I'd listen to her rant, empathize with what she's going through, reassure her that everything will be okay etc. Ultimately, I think it really depends on your ENFJ. \n\nI'm an ENFJ myself as well but I prefer having someone help rationalize and understand my situation. My INTP friends are really good at that so your type is actually the one I prefer going to the most for support. What they usually do is ask various questions about my problem and try to understand why I'm feeling certain way then they'd validate the situation and sometimes offer solution if they can find it.\n\nI also believe that most of us have a hard time understanding our own emotions or telling people about our problems so I'm pretty sure that you trying your best to reach out to her means a lot to her already and she probably really appreciates that. Let her know you'd always be there for her. INTP, Fe maybe your weakest function but that strongest Ti you possess is wonderful so utilize it as much as you can. You can do it! Good luck!!
2	What are you most passionate about?	
4	Making the world a better place, Social equality and Personal growth :D
1	Everything— and if I am not, then I can be 😂
15	Making true friends is hard	I just realized that I've been comparing my friends personalities to my personality when evaluating friendship. For example, I'm fine with paying for someone to come visit but my friends are more hesitant when it comes to that. \nIs it just me or is this common? Am I just surrounded by not great people or am I holding them to too high of standards? 
6	Lol all my ENFJ friends have this problem. The fact of the matter is that people have different standards/values/priorities/opinions on how to act and live, and even those with the same standards develop/grow at different paces. \n\nInstead of evaluating everyone based on the standards you have set for yourself according to your own life experiences, maybe it would be a better idea to learn and adjust to people who are in different circumstances than you, or have different standards than you. \n\nI obviously don’t condone being okay with your friends lying/cheating/murder bc it’s “their opinion”, but within a certain threshold, there’s no objective “better” or “worse” when it comes to values and people prioritize things differently. 
4	Are you in a better position than them financially where you're able to pay for it but they can't? Maybe they really appreciate the fact that you can cover the costs because they can't? Not sure. Just throwing out some questions based on the information at hand. The older you get the more you realize things can't always be as easily reciprocated as when we're younger. 
3	It's normal if most people aren't as generous (in term of money) as you are. But some people are generous with time, efforts, attention etc to help you out even without benefit. Don't think that you hold them too high of standard, think of you being a rare person in this regard. Be proud of what you're doing instead of judging your friends who don't share the same value as you. My INTJ is a bit hesitant when it comes to money but I know she's willing to sacrifice other things very quickly. But if you think they're really fake like they never actually help you out unless with benefit, you might want to cut friendship or put distant. Spend more time filtering people and find those who share the same value as you.  I've a bunch of people like this. They consider me as close friend but I don't, I just help when I want and don't help when I won't. Not a big deal, I respect and love people wholeheartedly regardless.
2	you need to accept the fact that no one is perfect, even you. Your friends with different personalities are going to struggle in different areas of your life than you will. But that’s what makes this world so diverse and great!
2	Your standards are where you place them. I’ve had issues with friends like this in the past. I don’t actively pursue quality time with them anymore because they aren’t in a place in their lives where they are able to meet me halfway. I try to focus my efforts on the friends that are able to meet me halfway- but will always care for my flakier friends nonetheless because I know it’s not personal
21	12:01 AM melancholy	This is not depression. Just got home from hanging out with some long distance friends whom I love dearly and haven’t seen in a long time. Ennui? Is that the word?\nListening to the cure and david bowie and trying to just sit in this emotion instead of running away from it.

3	as a trans man I immediately ran into problems by question two.
3	Will an ENFJ know I have a crush on his friend?	Recently I started noticing that my ENFJ friend has been teasing me a lot lately about my crush. \n\nQuotes:\n\n"Dude(directed to my crush), I think the reason why she wants me to do another match is because she knows you'll stop playing if I stop playing."\n\n"Dude, she wants to play with you man, she misses you."\n\nHe also tends to create jokes that revolves me and my crush only. Such as being dramatic as hell when I told my crush to fuck off jokingly. I honestly don't know what's going on, but I suspect that he knows I have a crush on his friend.\n\nIf yes, do you think there's a possibility that my crush knows I like him as well? I'm currently crushing on an INFJ. \n\n—An Intp. 
6	I know that I’ve always been able to tell when one of my friends is into someone and vice versa. We’re pretty good at reading interactions and people in general so I wouldn’t be surprised if your friend is the same.\n\nIf the teasing and stuff is bothering you, just tell him to relax and say that you want to keep this lowkey. Also what do you mean by the last question? Are you saying you have a crush on your ENFJ friend and the INFJ?
2	Higher chance is, yes. Teasing is what I usually do too hahah but of course I'm careful if any of them aren't comfortable. I usually tease to leave a hint and INFJs I know are good at picking it up.
1	 I tease a lot but only to people who I’m close with and don’t mind it. If you mind, definitely have a heart to heart with your friend about it. They will probably feel really guilty and apologetic about it. But do whatever makes you and your situation comfortable. 
1	Yes.  He knows.   =|

24	Emotional Boundaries with Loved Ones and Taking on the Pain of Others	Since we're naturally empathetic and strong feelers, I was wondering if it's natural for us to struggle with establishing emotional boundaries, and resist NOT taking on the pain and problems of others? In my life thus far, I tell people that my empathy and compassion don't have an "off switch" (akin to how some subs don't have a downvote button). I'm either emotionally-invested by default, or completely disengaged. \n\n\nA prominent example in my personal life is the feeling of guilt with family. Although I know who I am and am firm in my beliefs,  when it comes to fighting with family and being gaslighted, there's a tinge of self-doubt and guilt, which has me question who I am as a person. \n\n\nAny advice on how to deal with this and start establishing proper emotional boundaries with people?
13	I deal with this a lot. I think ENFJs almost naturally tune into the emotions and auras of those around them, and for me, those feelings can be overwhelming. They become my own and it's taken some time for me to realize that this understanding of emotions is a great tool, but it shouldn't dictate my own emotional state.\n\nI find that stepping away from situations is really helpful because it gives me time to process my own feelings. I do this by writing them or talking to someone else who is less emotional than I (like my ISTP sister). This way, I can understand my feelings about something or someone versus what I've taken from someone else as my own.\n\nWhen it comes to my own feelings, I often feel like I need them validated by external sources so that they make sense. I'll look up ENFJ [insert feeling or phenomenon] and I'll feel better knowing that I'm not the only one dealing with it and that it's common for our personality type. Truly, it's about knowing your own values and beliefs and staying with them even if someone disagrees and maybe makes you question yourself. In taking some time to reflect on you sometimes, which we are notoriously terrible at, you're better able to establish boundaries for yourself and have a better hold on your own emotions.\n\nI hope that helps!
5	I’m also an ENFJ and have this struggle with family members. I appreciate this post!
3	INFJ and struggling with this too.
3	This is the part I can't relate with most ENFJs. I pretty much know the boundaries because I self-reflect a lot when I'm alone (high usage of Fi) which is the shadow function of ENFJ. Furthermore, I was raised by a balanced feeling ESTJ mother who taught me to protect ourselves and fulfill our need before others so we can serve them excellently. This is where I take diverge path than most ENFJs and choose me over others for the sake of others. Even when I was gas lighted by my family member, it has no effect on me. The only reason I apologize is because I was raised in religious upbringing so it's suggested to keep polite and be nice sincerely, or when I know I'm really wrong based on my principle of life.\n\nI'm just suggesting maybe you guys can use more Fi to understand your own feelings, values and Se to push people more as a defense mechanism if needed. Take more time reflecting to understand yourself. Once you know who you're, what you value and live for, you'll build like a fortress of emotional boundary. This is why some Fi user like XXTJ are very good at establishing them. Also I'm very manipulative, I might end up gas lighting them as a counter back which is very.. efficient.
2	ENFJ and I am trying to figure myself out and am finding that I do this as well... 
2	Fellow ENFJ here. I have the same problems with my family, even the part where standing my ground just makes them reaffirm their collective gaslighting and ganging up on me. I’m kind of at once the one people go to in the family as an emotional dumping ground and punching bag. They simultaneously go to me for my unique perspective in the family and capacity for empathy individually and chastise and ostracize me for it collectively. It’s a difficult spot to be. \n\nHonestly my family isn’t a bad bunch, a lot of them were just dealt really shitty life hands and have done the most to make the best out of their situations and persevere. However that doesn’t make the gaslighting and ganging up on me thing any easier, especially when it’s just reinforced when I stand up for myself. It’s difficult to navigate, because while I understand their emotional situations and the reasons why they do what they do, I can’t let that understanding allow them to walk all over me. \n\nI’m currently in the process of helping my immediate family move out of my childhood home and have been brutally reminded of this toxic dynamic I have with my family. I’ve kind of made a decision in the last week that I’ll extend the necessary formalities and niceties with them, visit on holidays, call once every few weeks, etc, but I can’t be emotionally vulnerable with them nor indulge them, as in actively engage and respond to, any emotional crises they may be experiencing and divulge to me as a kind of emotional vault of secrets. As much as I wish this was different, as I love them so so much, for the sake of my mental and emotional health, it has to be this way. I don’t know how this boundary will play out in our relationships in the future; probably not in the way I would consider ideal. But I’m exhausted and it’s time for a change. \n\nAnyway. Sorry for the huge rant. I hope this helped in some way. Feel free to bounce off ideas with me. I’m pretty new at this, too, and could stand an additional perspective. 
2	For me, I have a fix-it-however-I-can attitude. As a result it has landed me in codependent relationships, in a sense that I seek out men who need to be fixed. This part of my personality is my biggest mountain to tackle because it's just embedded in my DNA to want to be a problem solver. As an ENFJ you really have to learn to say no, and that's been my biggest task these past few months. You have to force yourself to not take the emotional aura of others so personally because sometimes it can and will consume you.
2	Need help with ENFJ friend	Hi everyone, I came all the way from my introverted realm to tell you guys about my ENFJ friend. I'm worried about her, tbh. \n\nWe met when we were 12 years old. We used to talk about music and bands all the time and how people hurt us and etc. \n\nAs time went by, I'm not the most realistic person ever, but she never ever stopped talking about bands and entering her dreamworld and never leaving it. \n\nWe're both 23 now, and she never leaves her house, when she does, it's with her parents. Her mom is very uptight and doesn't allow her to do much. \n\nHer main concerns are going to concerts, buying merchandising, refreshing instagram and twitter pages of her favourite bands and singers, etc. She finished college 3 years ago and hasn't found a job. She isn't looking for one, never sends CVs, that's why she's always at home. \n\nShe eats a lot of junk food. Fried things, sugar, high calories... as a result, she's gained about 40 pounds in the course of 2 years and knows it. She's even said she'd think about bulimia and putting ice on her stomach as she had heard that it helped losing weight. \n\nShe's too sensitive to criticism. She has a friend that she's told about her weight problems and so said friend gave her a book on dieting. She was depressed and thought it wasn't her business to meddle in her life. \n\nShe also has friends (who used to be my friends) who get mad at her for no reason, cancel meetings, etc, and she still likes them and wishes to be with them, even though she avoids social networks just to not talk to them and therefore avoid any problems. \n\nHer obsession with bands and artists is such that a common friend of ours has told she should think about getting a driver's license. To which she replied, "I don't have to, the guys I like (band members) all drive, so it's okay". This comment was serious and truly worried me. \n\nThe problem is I can't really say anything, as she's very very very sensitive and gets hurt by everything people say. I've also commented once I didn't like an artist she likes and I found said artist annoying, she then gave this 200 world reply stating her qualities and why she was amazing. \n\nI really like my friend but I think she goes way too far just to avoid pain. Help!
2	I think this isn't ENFJ related. Maybe you can ask another forum specifically for this kind of obsession. Sorry, I can't do much here.
6	E/I difference	What is the difference between ENFJ and INFJ can anyone explain please?
7	Stereotypically ;\n\n- ENFJ talks more than INFJ.\n\n- ENFJ would go miles far to keep chatting and adjusting their behaviour to match with people even though they're tired. From this ENFJ is seen fake because of constant changes of behaviour with a different group setting. INFJ seems to have limit at doing so and you can notice they're unable to keep up for too long.\n\n- ENFJ is more persuasive and pusher.\n\n- ENFJ would most likely take the leading role, seen as a natural born leader even when they don't think they are. INFJ can lead but they usually work behind as a supporter.\n\n- ENFJ help people and place an emotional investment in it. So they tend to mad at you when you don't listen to their suggestion or if you don't do anything about your problem.\n\n- INFJ help people but they don't place an emotional investment in it. From this, INFJ can be seen as fake because 'being nice for the sake of society or having to do so'.\n\n- ENFJ is seen as more emotional and INFJ as more logical.
2	Going by cognitive functions:\n\nENFJ\n\nUses more Extraverted feeling\n\n- Leading function is to connect with others and to make sure everyone is happy\n\nUses more Extraverted sensing\n\n- Acts in the now, tends to value experience higher\n\nINFJ\n\nUses more Introverted Intuition\n\n- Sees the bigger picture, recognises patterns in their surroundings\n\nUses more Introverted Thinking\n\n- Bigger focus on logical analysis, seeks precision\n

4	INFJ needs advice on feelings for and relationship with an ENFJ	\[sorry, first time posting, is this really too long?\]\n\n**what happened:**\n\nINFJ *f* here has a little crush on an ENFJ *m* in my class, both in our early-mid 20s, for quite some time now, learned to appreciate him as a friend learning that he had a girlfriend. Before I was able to see him in a platonic way, he had probed my attitude toward him a few times, but of course I tried to mask it knowing what he was doing, nothing need be known as long as we stayed friends/classmates. I heard he and his girlfriend broke up at some point but I pretend not to know as he never told me directly, and I try to stay skeptical to rumors.\n\nSo my feelings grew stronger recently having met him multiple times (in group settings) and feeling more connected through our interaction. I also recall signs he might have some feelings for me, though I might just be projecting:\n\n* smiled and looked at me as if he wanted to say something in class, but then quickly turned away without a smile blinking rapidly, could be blushing but I can't tell for sure (probably before said breakup);\n* sometimes checks my reaction when people talk about certain relationship-related topics *(could be my confirmation bias)*;\n* ENFJs stare at people a lot, but I feel he looks at me with a different level of intensity or interest sometimes – once he stared into my eyes for such an extended period of time a friend actually asked him what he's looking at so that he looked down and erased his smile, and said he was digesting my words;\n* stared at me in an absolutely crammed space and quickly turned away when I caught him *(just his regular ENFJ people-watching as I happened to be the only face he could see without turning his head? or was he staring at me for some reason while the others were talking?)*;\n* blushed when trying to tease/banter at least twice, once more energetically and confidently with eye contact, and once more recently where he smiled looking down with his body at an angle, gradually lowered his voice and eventually ended his sentence weakly and drifted off\n\nAnyway, I'm not expecting anything for several reasons:\n\n1. he might still be with his girlfriend;\n2. even if they broke up, splitting with a partner of 1/3 of his life can't be easy to get over;\n3. even if he's available and ready, he's not necessarily interested in me;\n4. even if he's available, ready and interested, I'm not ready myself knowing what a messy state of life/mind I'm in.\n\nHowever, finding him interesting and cool, I thought it harmless to get to know him better as a person and decided to text him. Our conversation was not flirty, by most standards anyway, but casually intellectual, and the length of our responses grew by a few times, but he stopped replying after several exchanges, which hurts. I pretended I wasn't hurt at our group gathering because I don't want him to feel pressured to do anything while he's, I think, still recovering; but it's also very hard for me to pretend I'm fine.\n\n**my questions for ENFJs:**\n\n1. What do you think he is feeling and thinking? Still recovering and rejects me because he doesn't want to lead me on? Not interested and doesn't want to lead me on? Our conversation was too boring and forced? Or was it something else?\n2. It really does hurt that even our platonic text conversation could not blossom, what should I do from here with him? How should I interact with him?\n\n**my questions for INFJs:**\n\n1. I know I should not, and I don't want to, have romantic feelings for him, but the hurt tells me I have some spark of hope if I am being completely honest with myself, should/can I get rid of this?\n2. After this, I actually feel less attracted to him, am I simply hurt and grew guarded, simply feel awkward being rejected, pretend I'm not hurt/interested to a point where I really believe so, or was I interested just because of perceived affection, meaning I am just selfish and, as I have been seeing myself, too unhealthy to be able to love someone?
3	It sounds like he's into you but probably has some reservations seeing as he has a girlfriend or just broke up with her. Honestly, I would steer clear of him (you can still be interested, just not that invested) until he makes a move. He will if/when he is ready. \n\nPost-breakup times are vulnerable ones and being there for him romantically feels nice but as an ENFJ I've had a hard time sorting through my feelings when this has happened and wished my friend had been there for me, not because they wanted something from me so fast. If you care about him, take his best interest into consideration and give it time. That will give the (potential) relationship a better foundation anyways. Does that make sense? Just my own perspective.\n\nAlso, I feel like you are taking things too personally right now. He is going through a lot, and you need to redirect your energy towards yourself and others. Try to alleviate the expectations put on him and rather enjoy life on your own terms. That's what I find most attractive and he will join you where you are when he is ready if he's into you. 
2	I wouldn’t really take that as a hard rejection per se. I would test the water and text him out or the blue and see how that pans out first. I would innocently try to be his friend and see what comes of that first. 
2	My Fiancé is an INFJ and we met at a party I was very smiley and friendly. At first we had our difficulties, I came on a bit too strong and he a bit too reserved, however, we are now\nEngaged to be married and couldn’t  be happier. In my experience, it is very difficult to hide when I like someone. I become very giggly and want to be near that person. Sometimes I am just waiting for the other person to make he move. Don’t be afraid to put yourself out there! Sometimes I think we ENFJs put too much into trying to\nPlease everyone we lose a bit of ourselves. Don’t be afraid to ask what we truly think though. 
2	sometimes I don't reply to messages bc I:\n\na) missed the message in my sea of notifications\nb) saw it, was busy, forgot to reply later\nc) didn't think it warranted more than an one word response, thus didn't bother
1	He probably likes you!! How exciting. Just play your cards right and give him a little more attention than normal. He will notice! 
16	Having a crush making people twist the facts	I see so many posts on different mbti subreddits where people ask if their XXXX type friend likes them. For example: “He/She came up to my state and visited me randomly and we spent the whole day together having so much fun.” or “He/She always texts me first asking me to hang out and we always have a great time.” “He/She told me about this girl/guy they like but I think they were just playing hard-to-get. Do they like me? Or do they just see me as a friend?”\nHow will any of us know??? People comment things like “It sounds like they like you” but in reality it could be anything! They could have feelings for you, they could be trying to figure out how they feel about you, or they could just be genuinely interested in who you are as a person and love being around you in a totally platonic way. We as a society don’t value strong, emotionally intimate and affectionate friendships between the opposite sexes. We jump to conclusions that as soon as a man shows emotional interest in how we think and who we are as people, they automatically have feelings for us and are trying to get to know us to ultimately start a relationship. \nIf you have feelings for someone, tell them (in person!). If you don’t have feelings for someone, but think they may have them for you, be communicative about the nature of your friendship and then don’t be afraid to keep up the friendship! the other person can get over their feelings. You told them how you felt. \nI just think we all need to calm down a little bit, and if we want an answer we should ask the question. 
2	I'm impressed by the way you put this. Preach!!
0	Ti user detected even if you are an FJ I can still smell the Ti in your argument structure.
13	What do you guys look like when you're angry?	I hear ENFJs are slow to anger. But once you are angry, how do you guys express it? I don't expect everyone to have the same answer ofc, I'm just wondering.\n\nPersonally, as an ENFJ myself, when I get angry my first instinct is to employ caustic sarcasm, and I smile a lot. 
26	A maniacal, laughing bitch with a sarcastic, biting tongue filled with years of stored, minute, and discreet observations of things you actively repress or deny but are obvious to ENFJ’s. It’s not pretty. 
11	Angry or rage? Anger I am quiet and don’t really look different, just not much smiling.\nRage I turn red and my veins pop out and I just need to go off and be alone.\nHonestly rage only happens when in the shower and letting my mind wander to certain subjects/people that get me in that poor mood. 
10	People don't see the anger. I feel I'm pretty good at seeing it coming. I'll warn them 'hey we should change this subject' and such. I know when I'm angry I hurt people and say things I regret later no matter how true they are so I leave. \n\nWalk out of the building/house/restaurant get away from it and rationalize with myself as to why I'm angry. Usually doesn't take long, but the anger they just gave me, one day when I can't get away it will all come back on them. Its happened, it's not pretty. There are 3 people that have seen me angry and they haven't talked to me since then. 
7	when I’m frustrated I show signs of physical irritation, like a clenched jaw or being extra fidgety \n\nwhen I’m actually angry I’m quiet & reserved. I’m pretty slow to anger, but I’m also really sensitive so I’m usually trying to rationalize my anger/sort out whether or not I’m being reasonable or offended because I’m easily upset
5	It takes a long time to get angry because I try to understand why people are the way they are. I get only angry if I feel like I or someone else is treated unfairly or people don't take care of what other people or I have to say or believe in. If it's a public setting, I would not show any anger or annoyance. But if I feel comfortable I would pick all the details of a situation and person who annoyed me, throw it at them and dramatize it. Then I manipulate them into understanding that they should rethink their opinion or words because everyone is different. 
8	I laugh at a lot. Lash out with some comments I stored in the 'I'll remember this' bank.\n\nIf whatever pissed me off is on my 'No-No' lists and really sets me off, I tend to be an over dramatic yeller. \n\nAlthough, I feel like it really depends on the context? 
3	It definitely takes a lot for me to get truly angry. But when someone really makes me mad, my manipulative side comes out.
4	I grit my teeth for a couple seconds and talk sarcastically with some words of hurt. I tend to talk quickly when I’m mad too and then I’ll end the sentence with a scoff and me shaking my head
4	I internalize my anger hardcore (which is what I think most ENFJs do). This means Im quiet because I don't want to say something regrettable before I figure out how I feel about the situation and how I should properly deal it. I hate feeling like i said or did something wrong to someone else (even if I'm angry at that person) so I force myself to look at the situation from an unbiased, ethical perspective. If I'm feeling too temperamental to do that, I will wait until I'm not feeling so emotional. \n\nMy advice to other ENFJs is to choose your words very carefully when angry because if you don't and say something unnecessarily hurtful, you will certainly regret it/feel guilty later. 
3	I dont really get angry often...maybe annoyed. When i am angry, i just let the conversation or whatever go or change the subject ahead of time.\n\nWhen i get angry or annoyed i start speaking faster and less calculated.
3	Usually I manage to control my anger, but when I do have to express it to someone, it kinda varies based on who I'm with. But usually I'm just really unemotional/neutral (and may use sarcasm). On rare occasions I'll go off on a rant, but that's usually when I'm venting to someone other than the person I'm mad at, or who's disconnected from a situation I'm mad at - and I don't think I look much different aside from gesturing a lot lol
3	I can only think of a handful of times in my life that I've actually exploded. Like screamed at another person. And all of those times included tears along with the rage. When I'm more "normal" mad, I'm a lot like you. I'm SUPER sarcastic and say pointed things to whoever I'm speaking with. I also say "dude" a lot (my SO point this out to me). Like "Nah, you do what you feel like is right, dude." I've been trying to get better with that haha.
2	[something like this]\n\n(https://giphy.com/gifs/editor-mad-men-joan-holloway-lDfmYB399lmUg) 
2	I don't get angry easily. It usually builds up. When it comes to the point where I can't stand up, I silence myself and ignore the person to calm myself down. Typically, the person would realise. However, I usually tell the person the reason of my anger after that. 
2	The Hulk but less green and smaller.  The smashing is pretty consistent with the character though. \n\nInanimate object can't press charges. Everyone wins. 
2	There's different levels to it but the most typical angry I  get is shutting down and internalising  anger - I become deathly quiet for fear of saying things I'll regret. \n\nThe more expressive outlet is crying angry which is annoying because I want to stab you but damnit the tear ducts are connected for some reasons! \n\nThe only time I recall fully in rage is driving down the highway by myself and screaming/crying out my despair/frustration.
2	Jeez when I am angry I can be really quiet at first but I have to let it all out.. I usually call my SO or best friends and go OFF. Of course, you can see it all over my face. I seriously can't hide it. 
2	I always do my best not to take my anger out on people, even and especially if they are the direct cause of that anger. When I finally do, it's a mixture of calculation and sheer passion/hatred. It's a controlled loss of control on someone or something and it's beautiful to watch. One time I was on the bus with the rest of my class. My roommate never cleans or helps around the room, is incredibly lazy, fat and disgusting. (Something very uncharacteristic of someone in the military.) He's very big about his image and I've noticed over the past few months he hates more than anything getting his reputation/image hurt in front of people. One day, we were on the bus, my roommate tried to *blame me* for failing room inspection because I didn't clean **his side** of the room.\n\nI started yelling over him, then screaming, not caring at all about anyone there with us. The usual calm, easygoing me was replaced with someone pissed off beyond belief, laying verbal waste to this dude. He sat so quietly which was also hilarious, considering he's the biggest smart ass and always has something to say. Everyone in my class already knew my problems with him. They said it was a side of me they hadn't seen before, that they knew it felt good to get it off my chest. How? Despite the screaming at him and me obviously being ready to fucking flip the bus, I was smiling the whole time and it was no-holds-barred at that point. He became the laughing stock of the class and we haven't really had issues since.\n\nDon't fuck with me. ***It's really not hard.***
8	ENFJ and manipulation	Heard you guys can be super manipulative...\n\nIf you don't mind sharing: What are some of the manipulative things you did to/on other people, what were you expecting to get out of it and how did it work out for you and the other person?
10	[deleted]
9	I feel like I can be manipulative because I know exactly what to say to stroke someone’s ego.\n\nSo an example; say it was a Saturday night and my group of friends and I are getting ready for a night out but one of my friends is bringing the mood down. I would go up to that friend and say “babe you are looking so hot tonight! Honestly your hair is looking so great I love the curls, and that top looks so good on you it makes your boobs look great!!”\n\nNow I would say those things because I can read the room really well (Fe and Ni) and I can just see that she is worried about how she looks or about seeing an ex or whatever the problem is. I say what the other person wants to hear basically. But it often works!\n\n*Note: telling the truth isn’t necessarily a factor in how I manipulate people in this way. Sometimes I genuinely mean the things I say and what people want to hear can absolutely be true. Other times I just say shit to get people to stop bringing down the mood of the group. 
5	To explain how for you:\n\nMy general method is through developing trust, presenting facts and asking pointed questions, establishing a goal (typically that I set and they buy into)and follow-through. We are FANTASTIC at following through, keeping people accountable, reminding them that it’s what they want and deserve. \n\nThat being said, it’s not always sinister...I use it primarily for good. 😊
3	I say things I know people will respond to and morph my attitude to ways that will please them. I think about what will make them “tick” and play into that by say, expressing interest, validation, etc. when I was young I was a horrible human being and would use it to get people to do whatever I wanted. I also did it to create chaos, which I’m not proud of. \n  A good example is my school days. So there was this core group of girls in my class who the “It” crowd you could say. One of the girls in my class was not wanted by them because she was quirky and weird, the other was simply tolerated. But the core 4 were strong. \n  I came along and wreaked havoc among them by pulling weirdo onto my side, and feeding info to the tolerated girl who I knew would run back to the Queen Bee and say everything I had told her. I used her to my advantage to cause dissension among the girls. \n  It worked. \nBut I scared myself by how easily and smoothly I could manipulate them. The tolerated girl 100% thought she was my friend and didn’t have a clue as to what I was doing. \n  Weirdo thought it was all awesome payback for all the crap those other girls put her through, and I used that as my justification. But it was wrong of me to do it. And I scared myself (I thought I was displaying psychopathic traits) into purposefully not doing it again. 
2	I manipulate social conversations away from awkward situations and conflict. As an ENFJ, I'm very good at leading social interactions and when I see someone becoming uncomfortable, I immediately jump in and deflate the situation. I'm really good to have at a family dinner because I will defuse conversation time bombs. When I fuck up and am the reason for the conflict/awkwardness (because I'm too busy being a exhibitionist), I am very quick to change the subject or charisma myself out of my mistake. \n\nThe bad part of it is I can use this skill to get out of doing stuff or being responsible. When someone calls me out with legitimate criticism, I am able to wiggle out of it by appealing to their interests/personality. I try not to do this too much anymore because I feel guilty for it, but I used to do it a lot as a kid. 
1	I only get manipulative when I feel a situation running out of my hands, it was a bad trait I have thankfully gotten over but in relationships, when something was going bad or straying, thats when the manipulation would kick in. Being aware of it now has helped me move on from that, but I know 100% thats one thing I used to do. More or less it was always bc I was either afriad of losing someone or I knew a situation wouldnt go the way I wanted. 
2	pSA for all ENFJs	please date more ISTP's. We got Se. \n\n.\n\nAlsotiredoflosingyouunicornstoINTPnerdsandINFPcrybabieskthxbai\n\n.\n\nshout out to my INFP and INTP exes <3
9	I don't like your entitlement and negativity 😊
2	what about INTPs? a mature INTP is the best
2	INFP here, let us love youuuuu
2	When I think of ISTPs I think of Achilles in the Trojan War.  You don't lead these people, you just unleash them and prepare for the mess they leave. \n\nThey're pretty sexy but long-term investments?  Maybe ENFJs that enjoy a bumpy ride? :D
1	if you think an ENFJ that knows of MBTI would willing go for someone with no N, F, or J.. you are nuts. (no offense but, as someone who dated an ISTJ.. not into robots)
1	What does “pSA” stand for?
1	I think I met an ISTP younger than me a couple weeks ago. \nIt was pretty hard to maintain eye contact. He had the prettiest blue eyes and I thought I might get lost in them. I found his calm confidence alluring that I wasn’t sure if I was like that in that 1 hour of talking with him. He shared the common interest with me for deep topics and just experiencing things with an open mind about culture. It was memorable.\n\nI’m taken and didn’t want to send the wrong message by giving him my number. Now, I regret it because maybe he and I could have been good good friends. Can you even exchange numbers with guy strangers without it being perceived as being more? 
19	ENFJ connection to animals?	Do any other ENFJs have a very close connection with animals? My interest in people and my empathetic nature carry over to animals and I always want to connect with them.\n\nIs this just me or do others feel similarly? What types are most passionate about animals or feel a great connection to them?
11	If I run into a Squirrel I definitely say 'Hello, how are you doing?'. Which is more than I do for most humans I run into. So there's that. 
8	Definitely.  I can understand (cognitively) and connect to animals as deeply as humans. They have their own personalities and its possible to communicate on their levels. They have souls just like us. Children and dogs are very similar.\n\nI also love trees. They don't have brains, but they have a deep and mystic energy of life about them that I can appreciate. I don't tend to slow down enough to connect with garden plants tho...
4	Yes, I'd say I have a very close connection to animals and really nature in general. In the past, I've worked at a wolf sanctuary in Norway. I've also worked as a tree doctor in India. In terms of the USA I volunteered to help treat and rehabilitate dogs abused by dogfight rings in Mississippi. I was also raised in an eco-village in Idaho. These experiences really formed the way I see the world. My worldview is deeply intertwined with Biocentricism, Biosophy, and Biotraditionalism. I've always held a very deep respect for nature, both on a physical and metaphysical level. 
2	me and dogs and whales and trees are one and the same. sometimes horses, too. 
2	Yes, I love animals, and in turn, almost every animal that I have met quickly warm up to me and come to me of their own volition. I used to volunteer at a couple of animal shelters, and this was always the case with both dogs and cats. Even the cats that were notoriously "shy" towards other humans would come and drop into my lap and purr up a storm.
2	We're actually capybaras in human suits.
2	I dont't. They seem cute to me, I have a dog at home but I know that my love to this dog will never be as strong as to people. I mean I can be empathetic with injured animals and I would do my best to help them in this situation, but I am not a good "mom"  for animals for long period. Trying to work on it
2	Yep. I feel a lot more towards animals then humans. 
1	I volunteer at my local animal shelter and foster neonatal kittens. It makes me feel so good to help the animals <3
2	INTJ trying to understand you people	Greetings extroverted protagonists, I recently was researching and it says your type enjoys conversation with mine . Anyone go ahead and dm me. 
2	wow you are a scientist hello
17	completed questionnaire, resulted in ENFJ, identifying with it to 95% except the fact that I feel like I'm an introvert? Any ENFJs out there that don't necessarily replenish energy from being around new people all the time?	I have done the Myers-Briggs numerous times before but never really remembered my result or felt like I really identify with the result that I've gotten in the past. However, I did it again yesterday and got ENFJ as my result (which I think I may have gotten in the past as well). This time, I read through the description (on 16personalities) and felt like yep, yep, yep, this is SO me. Especially the parts about leadership/tendency towards bossiness, as well as being overly caring/inquisitive towards romantic partners.\n\nHowever, the thing I have an issue with is the whole extraversion/introversion part. When I'm around new people, I tend to lead the conversation, not having any difficulty in introducing myself to strangers and asking lots of questions if the person I'm talking to seems shy. I think my friends see me as quite the talker, and I've been described as "bubbly" numerous times. I've worked several part-time jobs that required me to be very outgoing and social (very active, customer-facing sales jobs) and felt confident and comfortable in those roles. However, I rarely seek out new social opportunities and would definitely define myself as more of a "stay at home with a good book-person" instead of a "going out to meet new people-person". When social situations present themselves, however, I am usually comfortable and definitely not shy at all. But, if I need to answer if I get my energy from being around other people or being by myself, I think I lean towards being by myself. I don't tend to push new friendships forward either, and sometimes I might be a bit dismissive towards people that I don't find interesting. Maybe the most recharging activity for me however is being around my partner or very close friends, feeling like I can totally be myself and just kind of relaxing and doing nothing with someone I know knows me inside and out and vice versa.\n\nDo I sound like an ENFJ? Does anyone else here feel like I do? I know these personality types aren't hard science or black and white or anything and that at the end of the day, everyone is unique, but I'm just curious if anyone else feels like I do. Furthermore, I looked at the description for INFJ, and did not feel like it resonated with me at all.
13	A few things come to mind. I’m sure many of us are the same way, in fact I would go as far as to say all the enfjs I know personally are this way. From what I see, you have more extroverted traits than introverted. An important thing to consider with mbti is that the terms used differ in the way they are commonly understood or used. Introverted does not necessarily mean shy or a being a hermit. Likewise being extroverted does not mean you have to have the largest group of friends and go to the club and not enjoy your alone time. Most ENFJs are comfortable having a tight knit group of friends, a few very close, where they seek their meaning and are validated. The point is you are still seeking meaning from the external world, you enjoy engaging with people around you. There’s a lot more to say about that, but another important point to consider is what percentage you fall into each category. I believe a lot of tests can give you these results and these results can change depending on when you take the test. Lastly, ENFJs are strong feeling types. Social interaction can be exhausting at times. We give too much of ourselves to others at times, our full attention and empathy. You need time to recover if it becomes too much. Solitude is good for this. At times you just want to think about life and people and your interactions and learn something about yourself in the process. I don’t know too many infjs who just straight up talk to strangers, they tend to avoid it. Also since you’re revisiting this, check out your inferior function as well. Hope that helps! 
5	Yes, I do. I heard that it's a normal thing for ENFJ. I've got a balanced IE percentage according to online test (of course not that reliable anyway) and being around many people can drain my energy. Though I'm very excellent and charismatic, people often mistaken me for full extrovert and invite me to a full-time-party on weekend omg. I prefer to be alone entire week but when the time calls for it, I can be super charismatic and get to be the centre of attention. I think it's really normal. The 'extrovert stereotype' usually can be found stereotypically in ESFP. More than half extrovert I know in real life exhibit the same need in solitude like us. \n\nAnd funny thing is, about 70% INTPs I know love outdoor activity with stranger or acquaintance.
3	Are you me? I feel like I can get INFJ or ENFJ depending on the day but I realized I fit ENFJ more often. Plus my S.O. is an INTP and comparing myself to him in terms of introversion...dang I feel extravert. I’ve learned to appreciate this about myself - I can enjoy the company of friends, be “bubbly” and charismatic, but I can also enjoy the quiet moments of solitude as well. Welcome to the team! 
2	An extremely common misconception is that being an extrovert means that your outgoing and being an introvert means that you're shy. Whilst most of the time these things do go hand in hand the actual difference between extroversion and introversion is the energy surrounding being with others. And for sooo sooo sooo long I've considered myself to be an introvert because I'm shy... but then I met my boyfriend who you would think was an extrovert because he's very talkative, and outgoing. He's actually introverted, because he gets drained quite easily and really needs time out to himself and gets really stressed out and agitated if he's had a lot of contact with other people. I on the other hand am not this way in the slightest... I don't like being alone/ having alone time (although I find myself alone quite often... its not ideal). And I don't get drained from being around others and need to recharge. So I'm a shy extrovert. Over all I would say your an outgoing introvert. Hope this helps. 
2	I scored only 1% extroversion over introversion when I took the test. The results said that means I would display traits with both INFJ and ENFJ. So I know how you feel. I would say 75 % of the time I enjoy being around people, but then I always find myself after prolonged social interaction wanting and needing time to myself. I can go days with one thing after the other after the other talking with people, going to activities, etc. but at the end I’m tired and want to “recharge” for a few days of just me by myself. Btw, towards the end of those social charges days I’m getting pretty grumpy so it’s not like i get better with the more people I talk to. It’s a downward spiral, lol
1	Yup, total introvert, but I love helping people and working with the public!
1	ive done the test 100 times, always ENFJ, as well. But I will say I prob would have tested and I over E as a kid, I never had to balls to do a lot of things extroverts test as til I was in college. \n\npeople are draining, especially to us when we give our all to everyone we love and devote a lot of time to their needs over ours. I live alone, I love to be alone, and look forward to breaks from people. \n\nWe're just human. 
1	I definitely need to unwind on my own.  I am also an only child so maybe that has something to do with it.  If I am around new people, sometimes I can't wait to get home and relax on my own, though I very much enjoy socializing.  I think an "e" can have a lot to do with how you interact with people, as with me, I am very externally focused, in that I need to talk to others about my problems and the opinions of others influences my daily and life choices.  A combination of things can lead to that "e", rather than just simply getting energy from socializing, because I am definitely ENFJ and I feel the same way as you about this.
1	 dang brooooo you FAKER u lied on the test!!!! 
7	Is it normal to admire ENTJs?	Hi all. As an ENFJ, I want to leave a positive impact on the world and do that in the most productive ways possible. At the end of the day I care about people, their stories, and their emotions.\n\nI was wondering, is it normal to admire a lot of qualities of ENTJs? I like how they are able to just sort of get work done. I think of characters like Claire and Frank Underwood as examples. They are ruthless in order to achieve their ends, even if it is self serving.\n\nI just wish that I could be a little less driven by my emotions towards others so I could leave a more lasting impact for others, if that makes sense. Like I want to be better about not always being concerned about what others think of me or helping every single person I can when someone wants something from me.
3	Omg yes yes YES! It's funny that you posted this because I was literally just thinking about this the other day! I was just talking to someone about how I sometimes I wish I was an ENTJ with only a slight preference for thinking over feeling, because I feel like I get too caught up in my emotions sometimes so it would be nice to be slightly more compelled by thinking (I am almost predominantly a feeler as per my MBTI test results),  but at the same time I really value how in-tune I am with emotions because I feel like it gives me the upper hand in assessing people and social situations, which I think is really valuable in a lot of different situations. Like I can walk into a room and almost immediately pick up on the mood/vibe of the people in the room. \n\nOn a related note, do you watch the Office? I've read that apparently Jim from the Office is an ENTJ and I feel like I really admire and almost aspire to be similar to his character, so I definitely understand what you're saying!
2	It depends on the ENTJ for me. I only know 2 ENTJ’s well in my life (both females). One of them I absolutely admire, and the other... I find so hard to get along with. \nThe one I admire seems so insightful to me. I ask her for advise on something and she comes up with amazing practical and realistic ways to deal with things that hadn’t even crossed my mind because I’m so caught up in the emotion of it all.\nThe one that I don’t get along with on the other hand is so insensitive to the people around her and comes across as super arrogant. She doesn’t realise at all the impact she has on the people around her. It is so frustrating and I clash with her so much!! 
1	Claire is an INTJ.\n\nBut yeah it is normal for ENFJs to admire ENTJs.  Te is the enfps 8th function.  They admire Te in others and wish they have more Te themselves.  ENFJs use Te all the time they just ***do not realize*** they use Te because it is a shadow function and often the hardest shadow function to consciously access.\n\nThus ENFJs often associate the Te inside of themselves in a negative sense like why did you let me down Te or if I did Te a little better I would have succeeded at X and not have failed at X.  Not realizing Te was there and helped them do tasks A, B, and C.  Aka Te in yourselves rarely gets any credit but Te in others is something to be admired.  
1	It's funny that you post this because I have been thinking about it as well. Lol this is kind of an ego trip but, I half jokingly believe that ENTJs are the BEST 16 type personality because: \n\nExtraversion means they are naturally sociable\n\niNuition means they see the big picture\n\nThinking means they are more logical and can think more technically \n\nJudging means they get shit done\n\nTheoretically, ENTJs are able to do almost anything (although they do have their small handful of flaws)
4	How to Stop Being Jealous/Moving On?	Hey all! 20 year old ENFJ guy here looking for some advice!\n\nThere’s a good friend who I’ve been seeing forever now and I’ve accepted for myself that she doesn’t have the feelings for me. I think I’ll tell her how I feel sometime this summer as we are both in our summer semester but I’ll have to think about where I want to proceed with her.\n\nSome of my friends, including her, would talk about things like love, sex, dating, etc and there would be times when she would mention to her friends about how she’s been trying to talk this guy. Or how she needs to be sexually attracted to someone to be interested in them, or how she enjoys the chase of pursuing someone, etc. \n\nI’ve noticed in the past couple weeks, it’s made me feel jealous and upset that all the times and sacrifices were an illusion for myself, thinking that I would be able to have her fall for me. And to see that she goes after some athletes who don’t care for her makes me upset when it’s brought up. I just don’t like being around when it’s talked about because I feel pathetic for being the one that did everything for her. \n\nAny advice on how to get combat this jealousy? I’ve noticed that it affects my mood, makes me irritable, very moody, and angry. I say things I don’t mean and become an attention seeker. Every time this happens, I regret it and am embarrassed.\n\nAlso, any tips for moving on from this long one sided pursuit? We are close and have shared so much with each other and still care for each other. But every time I see looking amazing or acting in a certain way, all the feelings just rush back.\n\nThank you all in advance!\n\nTD;DR: How to stop being jealous? Tips for moving on from a one sided romance?
6	when I get into that situation, I transform the jealousy into support.  For example, one of my best friends got a girlfriend and I was extremely jealous of her for it. I had to change my mindset from "why won't he be with me" to "I hope she makes him happy".  The core of this jealousy seems like a mild sense of entitlement of getting a reward for all the nice things you do for her.  Wrapping your mind around the idea that she doesn't feel the same and accepting it will make it easier for you to listen to her talk about these other people and you'll be able to see things from a different perspective.\n\nIt's good that you've accepted the idea of her not having feelings for you, but to truly accept it, you would not have these feelings of jealousy.  The more positive your mindset of a situation, the easier it is to get over these feelings.  Whenever I find myself feeling extremely jealous, I would remind myself that if my feelings for the person were true, then I would prioritize their happiness (in a healthy way) over my desires.  The point of loving someone is to care about their needs/happiness, even if it's not with you.  Because otherwise, are these feelings truly love, or more along the lines of selfish desire.  That's how I typically go about feelings of jealousy
3	Ive been in this same position before and know how you feel. jealousy can be an itch on an asshole, that you can't correctly scratch. \n\nThe way you should go about it: carry yourself as a busy person and find other interest, anything besides her (join a gym, hang with other groups of friends, create art, travel,ect). from the outside, she might see your potential and see that you've been developing into someone she likes. \n\nalso, don't jump at an opportunity to call/text her, your time is equally valuable and sometimes you gotta wait til she calls you up rather than calling her.  \n\nTry to not let it affect your mood, i know this might be hard to do, but i think most people are attracted to someone with a kinda "careless, playful" personality.  joke about things, most people feel good around those who aren't so serious about things. \n\nhopefully you'll naturally find common ground. \n\nand if it doesn't work out, trust me, you dont want someone in your life who doesn't feel the same about you. 
3	Well, I'm an INTJ, and jealousy is something synonymous with my type. Jealousy doesn't come usually, but if I encounter someone who is as intelligent as me or more, or better than me at something, I become jealous. This jealousy is what leads me to better myself so that I can be competent.\n\nOne thing I noticed is that it's impossible to remove jealousy from my personality, because it's just one of the hundreds of emotions wired into our brain. Same applies with emotions like anxiety and love.\n\nAcceptance seems to be the best way to keep the jealousy under check. Instead of battling it, make a deal with it, work together with it. Just accept the feeling of jealousy as a part of yourself. Channel this energy into something productive, like improving yourself.\n\nAnd yes, don't care about unnecessary things. 
2	Sounds like you need some healthy distance - doesn't mean you have to completely cut her out of your life, but find some other friends to hang out with who you're not romantically interested in. \n\n>'I’m not going to lay down rules like “You have to stop hanging out with the person you love!” or “You can only call them twice a week!”  \n>  \n>Every relationship is different, every person is different, and I can’t tell you what will work for you.  \n>  \n>What I can say is that, most of the time, it’ll be helpful to create some extra space between yourself and the person you love while you work on healing from the loss.  \n>  \n>Extra space could mean cutting in half the time you spend talking to them. It could mean taking a few weeks or even months off from seeing them at all. It could mean setting aside certain days and times where you focus on other relationships, other activities, anything but them.  \n>  \n>Pick what seems to work for you – but do something to create some space.'\n\nI highly recommend reading the rest of the article here, as it really helped me recently to deal with an unrequited love situation: [Unrequited Love for a Friend? Here Are 6 Ways to Deal](https://everydayfeminism.com/2016/01/dealing-with-unrequited-love/)
2	Honestly, you're 20.  That's SO young.  This girl is presumably around the same age and probably still dating guys for their looks first, everything else second.  Be a good friend to her and support her.  Make her feel good about herself and continue to show her the best version of yourself.  I bet she'll come around some day.  \n\nSource: Fell in love with my best friend after 17 years! (Hopefully you won't wait that long, though ;))
6	What’s your love language?	I took the quiz and got touch as my first followed by quality time as a close second. I’d be interested to see what other ENFJs get!
8	Mine is quality time first with words of affirmation right behind it! This was taken years ago but quality time is still for sure my top love language
5	Physical touch and quality time. Words of affirmation are nice too.
5	I like Spanish
3	Had a three way tie between touch, words of affirmation, and quality time. It was the weirdest thing!
3	Acts of service!
3	Touch and giving small gifts (when you are going shopping and see your partner's best candy or icecream and  buy just like that or you just make nice dinner without any occasion) 😊
3	Mine is gifts for sure and I hate saying that because it makes me sound so spoiled, but hear me out.\n\nAs an ENFJ, it makes me very uncomfortable and guilty when people spend large amounts of money on me. But if my husband runs to the grocery store for something and picks up my favorite candy bar for me, it really makes my heart flutter. Because I know that in that moment at the store he looked at the candy bar in the checkout line and thought of me and wanted to spend that extra dollar to make me smile.\n\nHomemade things are the same way, if someone spent time and energy creating something especially for me, that is really the best gift I could ask for.
2	My ENFJ girl got the same results as you. I'm an INFJ. I got touch as my first and words of affirmation as a close second.
2	Quality time ; words of affirmation.
2	Quality time and words of affirmation 😊
2	Definitely touch and small gifts. I want them to be proud to be with me and show me off by putting their arm around me or holding my hand. I had just started somewhat seeing a guy before my birthday and he brought me candy and flowers while I was at work. It made me feel like the most special girl in the world. 
2	Receiving gifts and acts of service. Love and benevolent intentions are not useful unless you act on it externally. Actions speak louder than words, after all.
1	touch
1	My girlfriend and I are both ENFJs, but have opposite love languages. \nI'm touch and quality time and she's gift giving and words of affirmation. 
1	Words of affirmation for sure
3	Wise careers for hands-on ENFJ's who like flexible schedules and selling?	The 9-5 is bumming me out, the office lifestyle feels stifling and secluded. In the past I have enjoyed the educating/sales aspect of retail, the hands-on part of foodservice, and the rewarding feeling of helping someone find what they're looking for. I'm also a creative type who likes to stay up late and not do the same thing every day. I'm wondering if a job as a sales rep would be right for me. Does anyone have similar strengths and a happy job?
3	I started my own company and know I definitely don't do the same routine every day. In fact, I always need to come up with a new idea and get into a bigger project. So I guess ENFJ is fine with a different routine, though I still have my to-do list. From your description, you'll most likely excel as a sales rep. My ENFJ business mentor was a sales rep too. He hopped from one job into another before he started his own company, but they all involved interaction with people.
3	Be an Engineer. Yes it's mainly an office job but you go out on site, meet lots of new people, do a lot of problem solving and making clients really happy when you find the best solution. I've been enjoying my job a lot! 
2	create your own coffee shop/bakery/juice bar!
1	Online TEFL teacher?
1	Decorating cakes! It's hands-on and hugely creative, you can do it from home, there's a business and marketing side to it, you get to consult with customers and come up with a vision together, and you can knock yourself out staying up late working on orders!
3	ENFJ Attitudes to Social Media	I'm a M 20 year old ENJF and I feel myself using Snapchat and Instagram a lot, sometimes an unhealthy amount. At times I've found myself using social media as a source of validation. Was just wondering how you guys use social media 
3	i have had an instagram account since i was twelve. When I was 19, I had about 2,000 followers. I checked instagram multiple times per day, posting every couple of days (usually photos of myself) and posting several times a day to my snapchat and instagram stories. I used social media to create an image of myself that I wanted others to be jealous of and like. I recently deleted my instagram account after I had the realization that I wouldn’t acknowledge an experience as meaningful or real unless I posted it online. I couldn’t live in the moment while hanging out with a friend, because I had to live virtually through it by posting the perfect video. Meals, walking around a beautiful area, shopping, traveling, everything wasn’t real until I had posted it. I decided to chop off the tumor that I had considered a part of me since I was twelve and delete my account, and now I feel free from this crutch of unhealthy self-validation and narcissism. 
1	was on it all the time, but now i'm almost 30 and i don't care for it as much anymore lol. still on it a good amount tho
1	My first social media I ever used was xanga (similar to myspace) and not too long after I got rid of it and went to Facebook, which I used from age 17-18 (possibly beginning age 16??). When I was 18, Facebook was beginning to change dramatically. Originally, it had positive image of keeping in touch with friends and family all over the world. Then they added games, drawings you could send, poking/thumbs up, and including a whole bunch of other crap. I got sick of people friending me just so they could increase the friend count online and those who only ever said hi to me on Facebook when I saw them frequently during the week. So, shortly after seeing Facebook change, I got rid of Facebook from my life. I never used Twitter or Instagram. I  do use Snapchat sometimes just for picture effects, but I never post it anywhere. It's usually for my own photo album or to share with friends or family via text/email.\n\nI'm glad people are starting to see the negative impact of social media on their life, especially in terms of authenticity and self esteem.
1	I use it for business purpose. I get money from using it and from having many followers, so you can see me on them nearly every hour. Plus it's ENFJ thing to be charismatic and inspire people, so people tend to follow you when you have a good motivational personal talk. But aside that, I won't bother registering an account. For me, it's useless to stalk other people pictures or read some news that I found out later to be a bunch of hoaxes. I prefer to do something useful for me and my family rather than wasting time looking at people selfies. Why does it even matter? I barely know them at all. Lol
5	Do you enjoy inquisitive people, INFP asking?	I honestly like to know and understand you guys better and I usually ask a bunch of questions. I wonder if you are okay with that or find it too intense? Thanks
11	I love INFPs. And yes I do enjoy questions but I like to have a rhythm with the person where we ask each other questions and build off our responses. But if you’re wondering if you can ask us questions generally, of course you can! We’re open and straight forward people
3	As long as I feel comfortable with you. But I'm pretty quick to shut down conversations when I don't want to answer questions. 
3	[deleted]
2	Hi INFP asking! It all depends on the person and on the situation! Let's say that some guy had a crush on me and I didn't like him back. I might not appreciate him asking me a bunch of personal questions and try to brush him off. Or if I'm not comfortable disclosing information about myself on a certain subject, I might try to move the conversation in a different direction. I can also see myself in situations where I'd appreciate, say, a new friend asking me direct and personal questions that inspire depth of conversation. Play it by ear, I guess?
1	Yeah sure, I'm fine with it (unless it becomes uncomfortable or otherwise creepy)
1	yes!! We usually adapt to whatever mentality is coming at us. I love being challenged and talking about people and ideas. ask awayyy
1	I LOVE questions
8	What do you all do for a living?	As an ENFJ I hate my office job because I'm not even remotely passionate about it. So what is it you other ENFJs do? Are you happy?
7	I moved from a corporate finance job to an operational finance job for surgical services in a level 1 trauma center. I get to check off all my boxes:\n-spreadsheets\n\n- analysis\n\n-data - oh how I love data\n\n-personal interactions with staff, physicians, and upper management\n\n-some patient interactions\n\n-computer system understanding and input to improve and modify\n\n-wear scrubs daily!\n\n\n\nI love the balance of extrovert/introvert I can have in my current role.

3	I work in digital marketing! I create advertising campaigns on social media and search engines :) I love my job. 
3	Software / computer science research. Happy with it :)
3	I'm an electrical engineer! I didn't think I'd be able to handle a desk job, since I love being active during work (I'm a little hyper haha), but I work with a ton of really awesome people and there's a lot of human interaction, so I really love what I do. 
3	Financial Planner at an RIA firm. I get to help people achieve their goals without selling any products. I love it. It touches on so many aspects of life.

3	I’m a private house keeper but I’ve worked many different jobs from being an optometric technician, to working in a fishing lodge in Alaska,  to substitute teaching, to being a farm hand at a fruit farm, did a stint as a volunteer firefighter. I can hold a job I promise, lol, but I like to try new things—I may be working on a fishing boat this summer if all goes well. 
3	I'm a stneographer/court reporter!, a very ENFJ-type job, if I do say so myself.
2	Just started Physician Assistant school a couple weeks ago. I love the idea of practicing medicine for its social aspect but I'm not naturally good when it comes to the sciences. I had to work a lot and barely made it in but I am happy that I'm on this road. I'm just anxious because we have over 75 exams this year and if you fail even one, then you're done which is terrifying for a bad test taker like me. But I know that if I just work on time management and balance, it'll lead to good results. 
2	Elementary school teacher!
2	Engineer! And I love it!! :)
2	I'm a Starbucks barista and I LOVE it\n\nmy dream is to open a cafe and I'm getting a lot of vital experiences in an environment with similar stated values to mine! even if corporate doesn't always follow through, my managers and partners do. 
1	[deleted]
1	I want to be a writer and a high school English teacher. Helping young people achieve their goals would be so rewarding for me. 
1	I am a full-time freelance contractor, training companies to use social media and digital marketing. I left my full-time office job a little over a year ago and can't imagine going back! I love the flexibility I now have.
15	What pisses you off?	Sincerely, from an INFP
28	Cynicism and narcissism. It gets really annoying really fast when you're listening to someone who's just so arrogant and selfish.
17	This probably sounds bad but when someone doesn’t give me an opportunity to speak. (I’m thinking of someone specific who pisses me off haha!) Like they ask me a question and then they talk over me straight away when I am trying to give an answer. This might come down to the concept of unspoken social contracts and me thinking deep down “that’s not how you are supposed to act! This isn’t how a conversation works! Wtf?!”\nIt also might come down to the fact that I like to feel listened to.
15	When someone doesn't follow through on plans. Or when noone's available to hang out :(
14	Being in a group of people that have no idea what they want to eat for dinner, and so we all end up shuffling around aimlessly. I'm happy to pick but I don't want to speak up and be the teacher/boss. Plus everyone just walks so slowly! 🤦🏼‍♀️ I feel so restless having to keep at their pace.
10	People who complain about anything and everything. \n\nPeople who are full of themselves and humble brag on themselves often. 
6	When I meet someone and listen to what they are saying whether that be a story or what they do or whatever, and then when it's my turn they don't listen or go on their phone. It's like dude do you really think I give a shit about your uncle bob? I'm just being polite can you reciprocate.\n\nI usually try to start banter with someone or a group because it's pretty easy to keep that going with equal participation from all parties.  
6	Negative/pessimistic people 
5	I would say the number one thing that grinds my gears are people that are full of arrogance. Seeing arrogance, lack of humility, and people slyly talking down to others is infuriating. That look on their faces, UGH. It's just that's basically the total opposite of who I am.
6	When people are incompetent and/or dumb. That is really infuriating. \n-ENTP
3	People who apologize about everything. Seriously, just own your actions and be confident! It's part of taking responsibility. 
1	narcissism. passivity. people who don’t care about improving others and the world. people who only care about themselves. people who don’t try to be considerate of others, who don’t fight for their values, who are lazy, who are mean. \nI also don’t have a ton of patience so when people are dense or slow or irritating it sucks. \nI also get pissed off when people are wishy-washy and not stable. When they don’t speak to me for months bc they don’t like me and then all of a sudden come back expecting everything to be fine. When people don’t have convictions, or simply do not care. It is grating on my bones. 
1	Cynicism, probably. I’ve been told “get off your high horse” more times in my life then I can count. 
1	dishonesty
6	Im not scared of people hating me, but...	But I'm so scared that they'll think that I hate *them*. A couple of my friends have told me before that they think I'm socially anxious, but it comes out as extroversion to the world. (Elaboration: they've told me "you just get so nervous about what to do and say that you talk to people and pretend to get excited, but you're really on edge. You laugh and make jokes and try to entertain them, and they think "whoa this person really likes me, they're so cool!" but then every interaction you have with people results in you being really scared of them.") \n\nI think that they're misunderstanding my logic. While I do get really anxious about talking to people sometimes, it's not because I want them to like me. When people dislike me, that's easy. I still interact with them, just with less.. stress. I think really it's that I don't want to talk to people and make them feel unimportant or unliked or whatever. \n\nDo any of you guys feel the same way? Or am I just an overthinking ENFJ? ;P
4	Aw that’s nice. Wish there was more people like you in the world.
2	Yea, i do see what you mean. I sometimes get a sudden spike in energy when i find some motivation off of doing something, having a resolve that means something to me, and i would share that vision with my friends in that same hobby. Eveything would be joyous and fun, and i can take part in bringing life to a group. But sometimes, i just dont feel like doing anything cus idk, nothing goes through my mind, ill be daydreaming or not feeling like doing anything. \n\nPeople may see that as giving them the cold shoulder, or not being my usual self. \n\n~Enfj male\n\nPs. I cant find any enfj males on here... Hit me up.\nAlso, still trying to learn more about other types, so anyone willing to exchange​ info? \n\nEdit: (referring to op) maybe its the difference between self-aware and being self conscious. Let me know what you think! \n
17	ENFJ What does it mean to have a loving personality in your eyes?	
11	A lovely personality to me is someone that thinks of themselves less and less everyday, and more about connection, relationship, and bonding with each rising sun. 
4	To me, if someone really loves someone else, they really enjoy and take comfort in hearing goodnews about that someone else. So, I’d guess that a really loving person would be someone who can really enjoy hearing good news for nearly anyone.
3	Someone who always thinks about how actions can affect another person. Whether those actions are made by the person or by someone else. 
2	Someone who can humanize their enemy. 
2	In my eyes, it means giving freely and generously through my actions. It's feeling happy when I see my loved ones soar.
1	a loving personality is one that isn't afraid of being honest and telling the truth, and is always supportive of people's best interests
7	Just curious: for those that have an SO, what personality type are they?	I’ve been hearing a lot about ENFJ/INFP and am curious if there are any other pairings out there. My SO is an INFJ and it’s a perfect match :) How about for you guys?
6	I'm an ENFJ and my SO is an ENTJ\n\nI find that we're very "similar but different". We generally have the same kind of thinking, morals, philosphies, larger picture thinking, but we come to the same conclusions in two very different ways. He's not very empathetic and sometimes I'm a little too sensitive but we talk it out and as long as we understand where eachother is coming from, we're happy. 
3	[deleted]
4	INTJ here and my SO is ENFJ. We work amazingly well together. We do have some small issues, which are entirely my fault because I am rather inexperienced with relationships and have been hurt in the past, but we get through that like a searing knife going through butter.
3	A bit late to the party. I'm an INFJ. Just yesterday asked my ENFJ girl and she said yes!
3	I've captured a INFP and all the warm mushy stuff is true! 
1	I have myself an Infp. It's the best :)
1	INFP (yes yes, that typical pairing) and INFJ. 
1	My wife is an ISFJ, we have a lot of similarities and a lot of differences. Our relationship has been going on for 8 years now and we still learn about each other all the time. It’s funny because my wife is a 80% S-Observant and I am a 90% N-Intuitive. The way I would describe us individually is that I’m a maker and she is an observer. 
15	What qualities do you like about INFPs when it comes to dating?	INFP asking.\n\nI feel so clueless when trying to approach people about dating :D\nVery unknown territory to me and this sub seemed really chill. \n\nAt the headquarters of the INFP community we mostly share our deepest and darkest secrets and comfort one and other. But actual tips about dating are rare to see :D
18	They're so warm, sweet, and affectionate. They're spacey in an endearing way. They're the best listeners and will be your best friend in the world. \n\n-boyfriend is an INFP
10	Not my partner, but my best friend is an INFP. It’s just really easy to open up to her and talk about my deep weird intense inner world and feelings that I tend to keep to myself otherwise bc others would think I’m crazy. She has a pretty intense inner world, too, and so she just understands what I mean without me having to explain too much. She’s also much better at contextualizing her feelings since she (and other INFPs) are Fi dominant and so she helps me contextualize and walk through my problems and feelings that I sometimes have a hard time identifying and understanding myself. And it’s not forced, it just kind of happens organically. It’s really nice. \n\nI had very toxic friendships before I met her and so I didn’t really even know what a real friend was until she came into my life and showed me. And when I realized that’s like a real friend I was like holy shit this is amazing lol. We rarely have hangouts without crying occurring bc we get so into talking about our worlds and feels. I’m so grateful for her presence and friendship in my life and honestly cannot imagine life without her now. She has irrevocably and inadvertently molded parts of me in the best of ways and I hope we will stay best friends for life n stuff. ENFJ/INFP relationships of any kind really are the best IMO.
13	Looking for an ENFJ friend / e-penpal	 I am a 28 year old female ENFJ-T. I am a very passionate person and often feel like I invest all of myself in my interpersonal relationships, but I usually end up feeling as if the love I give isn’t reciprocated. I’ve been disappointed with most of the relationships I’ve fostered with other people, but have never known another ENFJ before, so am hoping that a friendship with an ENFJ might prove to be very rewarding, as it’s possible that another ENFJ might understand where I’m coming from! :) \n\nAny ENFJs out there that would appreciate having a fast ENFJ friend / e-penpal? It would be especially amazing to meet another ENFJ-T, especially female, but not an absolute requirement. ;) 
5	Well I’m a 29 male from Ohio with discord, Skype, even down to text.\nIf a gamer I have steam as well.\n\nUp to you! No hard feelings if you’re really just looking for another woman :)
3	I'm a 19F ENFJ! Shoot me a dm :) I'd love a penpal (just a s a warning though, I would probably only respond to longer messages two or three times a week) 
2	[deleted]
2	29yo lady ENFJ-T here with the same problem! 
1	ENFJ 19F here! Would love someone to talk to ☺️
1	27/F and would love to have someone to talk to 😊
1	What is the -T for on the end of your topography?
1	Hi there! I’m a ENFJ-A; 21, F. Would love to meet one that’s ENFJ-T!! I personally feel the same way as I share similar experiences with your post n__n  
1	ENFJ-T 26F dm me if you want!
1	I'm a 27 year old ENFP and would be open to chatting, as I also deeply value my friendships. What kinds of things are you interested in? I would say my main passions are psychology, spirituality and personal growth. 
1	Hey. I would love to chat with another ENFJ. I have the same problem with other people. I am 23 years old from Czech Republic 😊
1	Hey! I've been out looking to make some ENFJ friends as well! I am a 30 year old male, from NYC
43	DAE feel like you are never loved back fully... that people don’t reciprocate the time and energy you give them.	I don’t know if I am on the unhealthy side of the scale but I just constantly feel annoyed and anxious that the love I give isn’t reciprocated. Does anyone else feel this way? 
14	100%. Last year I was upset about this and felt used which led to me cutting off some close friends for a while. It’s hard because I try to give it my all. I distanced myself until my friends would reach out to me 
9	I feel like this all the time. With relationships, friendships, family, etc. But I don't think that's real. I think that is a flaw with our personality type. I think that we are able to love so fully and unconditionally, that we forget that people whose brains work differently deal with those emotions differently. Someone can love you just as much as you love them, but still show it differently. \n\nExamples from my life:\n\n1. One of my best friends is absolutely awful about talking about anything serious. I will vent to her about everything going on with me and she will just nod her head and be mostly silent. Sometimes that makes me feel like she doesn't care. But I have known her for over a decade and the reality is that she doesn't know how to process those serious emotions like I do. She wants to help but has no idea what to say or how to genuinely help, so she just listens.\n\n2. My boyfriend is my favorite person in the world. He gets me like no one else ever has. But sometimes, he still struggles to understand what I'm feeling, and how I'm feeling, and how to help me. He gets it as much as he can, but sometimes he still ends up frustrated and unclear on what's really going on with me. It's not for lack of trying, it's not because he doesn't love me, it's just because our brains work differently, and my brain is WAY more emotional and he doesn't always understand how to navigate that.\n\n3. My family loves me. We are not terribly close and I definitely raised myself, but I still feel like they did try their hardest, for whatever that is worth. In adolescence I felt so alone and like maybe they "cared" but not how I wanted/needed them to. But they did care, however THEY could. It took me a long time to understand that my parents didn't just not give a shit, they just didn't understand what I needed from them. They did everything in their power to be the best parents from their own standpoints, and honestly that wasn't enough for me growing up. As I've grown older, I understand that maybe that still isn't what I need, but they never did anything maliciously, they just tried to love me in the only way they knew how. \n\nBasically my point, is that our personality type experiences emotions SO STRONGLY that we genuinely forget that other people aren't like that.  Everyone you love probably loves you just the same, but in their own way. Sometimes that doesn't feel like enough. Sometimes it feels like nothing at all. But when you see everything through 100/20 emotional glasses, you can't fault the world for seeing in 20/20 (or less) vision. It doesn't make it easier to deal with, but I hope it makes it easier to understand. \n\n
6	Yes, yes, yes. I think about this all the time. In general, I try to be as genuine and open as possible to others but I can get pretty burnt out when I don't receive it back. Some relationships with people come effortlessly, and others I feel like I'm doing most of the work...It takes a lot of effort to meet people who experience relationships and love the same way.
5	A lot of the time lately. With my friends especially. 
5	I mean, I'm pretty sure the answer is a resounding, siren-banshee scream of YES! Bearing that in mind, does anyone have any constructive tips on how to handle this? Or do we just throw away all of our friends and start over? *tee hee* 
4	I've felt this way many times. Perhaps it is one of those ENFJ traits we should simply learn to accept. Or maybe it also depends on the people we are with.\n\nI have realized that there are those rare souls who acknowledge and appreciate even the littlest things I do for them. There are also those who seem to take for granted the extra effort I do to keep them. \n
3	Totally. I always give my all for my friends and every once in a while, it feels like they're not doing anything for me, so I retreat from everyone. Then I feel lonely and guilty and 'stop overthinking it, sushi-n-sunshine', and I go back to my regular self. The cycle constantly repeats. 
2	I think my mum feels this way about me. I want to tell her that she just need to let me have space and I'll come to her. She's always doing stuff for me, but I don't need stuff. She'll do something major for me but then expects me to do something minor that I'm not comfortable with for her. I need understanding. \n\nPerhaps take a week to pamper yourself and love yourself, give the people you love a bit of space. After you can go to them and try to understand what *they* want. \n\nPlease don't blow their stuff/boundaries off as insignificant. If they tell you, it's significant to them. And if they see you making an effort on the things that are important to them for a few weeks in a row even if they're minor things, they'll be more receptive if you ask them to show you that they love you (even if they're major things).
2	Definitely, especially in romantic relationships.  I'm an ENFJ with only 2 friends (weird, I know), because finding someone who is going to make the same level of effort I do in a relationship (friendship in this case) is very hard to do.  My 2 friends feel like soulmates to me, because we are that close.  I do not put forth effort for relationships with people that do not reciprocate that effort.  
1	I totally feel you. It was like that for me for a long, long time a couple years ago. I let people walk all over me and it was unhealthy relationships. I had to let all that negative energy go. My cheerleader personality can get really exhausting when people take you for granted. \n\nAlways remember that you are amazing and I understand what you go through. When it isn't reciprocated, it's time to cut them loose. You are worth a lot especially when you put time aside for others who don't appreciate it. 
1	Sorry in advance for the moralizing tone, but I think that mindset is wrong.\n\nExpecting something in return from other people for your time and energy is pretty much the same mindset Nice Guys (TM) have right? Put kindness tokens in, get affection out.\n\nThat's not how people work. \n\nYes, it feels good to be appreciated, but that should not be the reason you love. As Immanuel Kant said, **humans should be treated as ends in themselves, not means.** In this case, expecting something in return for your love is treating people not as ends in themselves, but as means to validate oneself. That is not real 'love.' If humans are the ends in themselves, love is the means for them to reach their potential.\n\nPeople are not beholden to you or I. Those people did not force you to do good deeds for them; you did those deeds voluntarily, out of the kindness of your heart, or (more cynically) in a misguided attempt to gain love back in return.\n\nOnce you stop expecting people to reciprocate love, then you will be able to love more freely. It's like giving money away; if you expect the person you give money to pay it back to you *(which they're not obliged to;* **it was a gift, not a loan**) you'll be less stingy (and more careful) in giving away, while also becoming wise enough out of necessity to leave some for yourself because it's never guaranteed you will be paid back. Unlike money though, love can be given away infinitely.\n\nStop expecting love to be returned in kind. You *will* be disappointed. As a friend of mine one said, **the world does not owe you anything.** And you don't owe anything it in return. Anything you do, you do voluntarily.\n\nDisclaimer: Not to foster a 'martyr complex,' but partner empathy with common sense. It is good to love people, but you can love people while also being independent and not being a pushover.
1	All. The. Time. It’s hard not to become bitter and jaded, but I just keep going back for more. It’s also made me feel self-conscious about the time energy and emotional consideration I give to others, like I’m overstepping or overestimating our relationship. It’s a no win situation! But at the end of the day it’s a compulsion to keep on spending energy on others 
11	Worried that all my actions are driven by self interest.	Hi, I’m posting this here because I thought that maybe some of you guys could help me. I’m worried that I do nice things for people because I want them to like me, not because I like them.\n\nI think I’m someone who really lives off of the validation of others and doesn’t have enough empathy for those around me. For example, I posted this same topic on r/self and got called arrogant which really bummed me out and now I’m really worrying about the motivation behind my own intentions.\n\nI guess what I want to know is how do I have more empathy and gratitude for those around me and begin to do things because I like people rather than because I want them to like me. Any replies are greatly appreciated!
6	I think the first step is just having self-awareness. Next time you feel drawn to help someone, ask yourself - why? What need am I trying to meet in myself? Did they actually want help with this, or do I just want to be liked? Do I even like this person? \n\nI think it's perfectly normal to want people to like you, though if the problem becomes extreme and you become addicted to validation or approval, you might want to look a bit deeper and see a therapist. It also sounds like you may be an Enneagram Type Two, so you may find this helpful: [The Enneagram Institute - Enneagram Type Two](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-2)\n\nThe personal growth recommendations from the Enneagram Institute are particularly relevant:\n\n>Try to become more conscious of your own motives when you decide to help someone. While doing good things for people is certainly an admirable trait, when you do so because you expect the other person to appreciate you or do something nice for you in return, you are setting yourself up for disappointments. Your type has a real danger of falling into unconscious codependent patterns with loved ones, and they almost never bring you what you really want.  \n>  \n>While there are many things you might want to do for people, it is often better to ask them what they really need first. You are gifted at accurately intuiting others' feelings and needs, but that does not necessarily mean that they want those needs remedied by you in the way you have in mind. Communicate your intentions, and be willing to accept a "no thank you." Someone deciding that they do not want your particular offer of help does not mean that they dislike you or are rejecting you.  \n>  \n>Resist the temptation to call attention to yourself and your good works. After you have done something for others, do not remind them about it. Let it be: either they will remember your kindness themselves and thank you in their own way or they will not. Your calling attention to what you have done for them only puts people on the spot and makes them feel uneasy. It will not satisfy anyone or improve your relationships.  \n>  \n>Learn to recognize the affection and good wishes of others, even when these are not in terms that you are familiar with. Although others may not express their feelings in a way that you want, they may be letting you know in other ways how much they care about you. If you can recognize what others are giving you, you will rest more easily in the knowledge that you really are loved. Love is always available but only to the degree that we are present and therefore receptive to it.
4	Actually though, why would you acting morally good for selfish reasons make the good you do any less real? Who cares if you do good because it makes you feel good, or because it makes people like you. The effect you have on the world is what matters, not the internal struggle that caused those results. I say keep being selfish if it makes you and the people around you happy.
3	As an ENFJ who feels they can relate to this, I just have to say, yeah it’s hard. It’s really difficult to realize when one’s true self doesn’t measure up to one’s idealized version of themself. Sometimes our intentions are negative even if it’s subconscious, and sometimes the “selfless” actions we do, fuel our beliefs of superiority. \n\nWhat helped me a lot with gratefulness was thinking about the people around me and how they have affected my life. It’s crazy if you think about how much time and care people spend on you. One thing that might help is something simple, like writing 5 things you’re grateful for every morning. Once you realize how much others have given to you, I believe it will help you want to give back with pure intentions.\n\nMy warning: Be careful about intentions. If you focus on the intentions for all of your actions, it leads to a slippery slope of self hate.
1	I’m not an enfj (am infp) but I wonder if you guys don’t tap into your Fi very easily, so that means you don’t consciously ‘feel’ your feelings for them - unless perhaps they elicit a particularly strong reaction in you - which means you perceive people through your Fe - how do *they* feel about me/things - and your Ni - ‘what are my ideas about things?’ ‘What is my needs?’ ‘What is my agenda here?’.\n\nThe outcome of low Fi means you are not connected emotionally to many people in a deep way. Maybe. \n\nI’m throwing it out there as a potential theory to consider. I feel I have the opposite problem of being mainly aware of ‘what do I feel about this person’ (I can’t read/judge/understand their feelings for me easily at all and won’t take them into account often) and I’m just aware of their needs not mine (Ne) meaning I’m taken advantage of easily, and give away too much of my own opportunities too easily, which is wrong - all people are equal including me.  \n\nI use that to illustrate more about your functions, given we are opposites.\n\nMaybe you should try to develop your Fi so you deal with people via being connected to them, emotionally, not via your needs (or the other persons feelings for you). So that you yourself want them, not need them to fulfil role X Y or Z? 
8	Do any of you have a hard time meeting friends?	Moved to a new a city although this has sort of been an ongoing problem for a little while, at least since 2014.\n\nI definitely have friends but they are in my home state. I've moved for work. Could be temp, could be permanently idk.\n\nI tried looking on meetup for groups but nothing...there are possible yoga groups I could check out.\n\nI was supposed to smoke with a dude behind my cubicle but that fell through and he also doesn't seem very interested in people to begin with.\n\nI went to lunch with some other coworkers and they are certainly nice but not anyone I'd hand with often.\n\nI asked a guy who seems cool if he wants to get drinks with me after the office closed and he invited me out for later tonight so that's something I suppose.\n\nI have a variety of interests and such but a lot people I meet seem to be nothing more than acquaintances or people I just hang around if we are conveniently I'm each other's area.\n\nI'm starting to think I should just stop trying and be happy with smoking and drinking on my own in the meantime. I'm hoping maybe yoga or the guy who invited me or will be cool 
3	i had the same problem moving to a new city as well.  When i moved to SF, the entire atmosphere and environment was totally new to me and different from what I was use to.  I got use to being on my own and just relied on online chatting with my close friends and their visits.
3	ENFJ guy here. I too had a hard time initially when I moved from SV to Boston for a job. It definitely didn't help being an ENFJ and a SWE lol but you have to just let the relationships develop over time. Best friends aren't made over night regardless of how well you connect. But you gotta just keep your chin up and keep being your friendly self and things will slowly piece together. It's difficult because we can befriend anyone overnight, but that's not usually the case for other people meeting us for the first time. Back in college, we were surrounded by like minded people who were all going through the experience of college together. Good luck!
2	I have a hard time with this too, I've experienced changes in terms of who I'm around with college... I graduated last month and even before then, a lot of people I knew graduated a year ahead of me. It's frustrating when circumstances keep you from seeing the people you'd consider your friends, as well as when the new people you meet don't seem super interested, especially when YOU want to put in effort that they don't reciprocate. It's annoying af, time and distance SUCK

10	What are the qualities that you look for in a close/best friend?	Question says it all
22	I look for friends and partners (same values for both) who tell me the truth as they see it, who challenge me and make me support my opinions and beliefs, who are emotionally vulnerable and who work on improving and understanding themselves.\n\nI have fewer friends but they are deeper and more meaningful friendships and relationships than most people have.
9	Someone who makes me laugh, someone who doesn't pressure me into doing shit I don't wanna do. I'm a low\-maintenance friend, I don't need tonnes of social interaction but I like to be around people \- I'm perfectly happy having someone I can just chill with and spend the day in each other's company without feeling like you have to entertain each other. Not sure if that makes sense? Haha
4	I love this question since it shows us which values we hold closest to us, which varies with each ENFJ. The things I notice first are how genuine, kind\-hearted, and empathetic they are. What allows us to grow a deeper connection depends on how compatible we are, which touches on sense of humor, taste in music, perspective on life, etc. \n\nHonestly though, whoever has an open mind, loves challenging themselves and myself (in a non aggressive way), and is lighthearted and caring will always be good in my books. I should be able to be my very self around them and never feel an ounce of shame or judgement :)
3	Emotional Expression	As an INTP, I'll have moments where I'm in my head in public, but it's not obvious to others. I'll come across something that makes me smile or laugh, but I'll try to suppress the smile or laughter, so I don't look like a complete weirdo, but then I look even weirder. What should I do?
2	That I relate soooo dayum much so imma stick here and wait for the answer on your post... like a Hiena ...🐱
2	Are you asking how to better surpress the feelings you have in your head so that they don't spread to your face? Or are you asking how to embrace them so that people understand why you're smiling/laughing? 
2	Everybody does this. I wouldn't worry about it. If you laugh, laugh and own it. 
1	Accept the weirdness, be a weirdo. Polish the weirdness, be a hero.
9	Peer pressure and the ENFJ	I'm an INTJ with an 11 year old ENFJ daughter.  At least, I'm fairly sure she is an ENFJ; her personality is still developing, but there are some pretty clear signs.\n\nMy daughter has had strong Fe since she was a toddler.  She is a people-pleaser down to the bone.  This is unclear territory for her dad and I, since both of us are Fi users.  When she was younger, her Fe meant she was very compliant and a breeze to raise, and nearly everyone who met her fell in love with her.\n\nIn the last year or so, with adolescence and middle school approaching, I'm becoming concerned that this compliant, people-pleasing tween is beginning to have struggles I never had and for which my Fi principle-driven language can't help her.  She REALLY wants to make her friends happy.  This means she often says "yes" to whatever they want her to do without questioning whether or not SHE wants to do it or whether it is right.  So far these actions have been very PG friendly.  But risky teen temptations are coming.\n\nHow can I best arm her against peer pressure, especially the very common teen pressures of drinking and sexual behavior?  It may not be enough for me to teach her to decide what is right and best for her, as my parents did.\n\nENFJ's, what worked for you?  What strategies helped you navigate the peer pressures of your teen years?  How did you learn to say "no" to risky or unethical behaviors?\n\n**TL;DR** My ENFJ daughter is approaching the teen years and I need help figuring out how best to arm a people-pleasing Fe-dom against peer pressure.
8	Ad an ENFJ I always had a strong sense of what was or was not “allowed”. I never wanted to do anything illegal. Yes I wanted to please my friends but I also wanted to please my parents. I almost always picked the fear of disappointing parents over the pressure of pleasing peers. Not sure if this was a healthy parent/child relationship but I turned out okay and still love my parents! I think the best discipline for an ENFJ is the disappointment card that parents can play. Hope this helps!
5	I found it fairly easy to navigate. I was already aware though social education that drinking and smoking are bad so I just generally stayed away from them. Unfortunately it's every person right to try something...\n\nI think the best thing to do is arm her with education so she can make her own informed decisions. E.g. alcohol is not great because of these health benefits, but everything in moderation. If you are strong and try to teach her your beliefs, hopefully she will understand your point of view, if it's true and rational. Show her through your actions how to best engage with alcohol and let her first drink be with you as an adult to supervise (when/if she shows interest). My parents never really drank except for the rate glass of wine with a meal. I used that role modelling and I am not a drinker. Yes I did experiment because I wanted to know what drunk felt like and my limits but... because I've seen my parents drink sensibly, I understand how to do that.\n\nAlso sexually, imo the best way is to be open and honest as possible. Have on going conversations about this. Protection, STDs... masturbation. I think sexuality is very healthy and you don't want to shame her\n I think the biggest thing is that she is engaging in sexual activity because she wants to rather than to please others and feel validated. Imo this means that it's important to teach self love (ie be supportive of masturbation), because if she knows how to pleasure herself, then she doesn't need to rely on others.\n\nCommunication will be your most important tool. Discussion. She will look up to and respect your wisdom and feedback and you want her to feel safe to approach you if anything were to ever go wrong. If she can find validation through you too, she'll be less likely to do stupid things to get it elsewhere...\n\nI was a huge people pleaser. I'd spend all my money on gifts for others birthdays because it made me happy. She will learn in time. \n\nIf she's a true ENFJ, I really got into reading in my teen years. It was a mental escape, as my Ni was developing. Is she's an ESFJ, she'll be developing her Si, which will be more societally structured and wanting to fit in to the group more. I never wanted to "fit in". I was friends with the "rejects", because they felt more real than the fakeness of the popular ppl...\n\nI hope this makes sense. Don't worry too much is my main message :)
3	Being an ENFJ i experimented all through my teens but even so I’ve always been pretty responsible and if people around me were doing genuinely stupid shit I wouldn’t take part. \n\nIf they’re going to experiment though, they’re going to experiment regardless, your job is to help her make the right choices and guide, be someone she can talk about anything with and get solid advice from without fear of punishment, if she trusts you, you’ll know what’s going on in her life (rather than her sneaking around you) and you can help her navigate through it. Also let her know if she’s in a situation shes un sure of, she can ring you to come pick her up or ask a question, at any time.\n\nNow where you actually do decide to discipline her or let her know your disappointed is something you will need to figure out because that still has its place but speaking from experience having a more open dialog with my parents is something I’m thankful for that I had growing up.\n\n
2	Kind of what everyone else is saying. By bringing her awareness to the facts of life, it will help her dodge between life choices as they come. Regardless she will 9 our 10 probably do whatever she feels okay. Us ENFJ live and breathe off our intuition. If you can help her develop really strong principles, morals, and overall awareness to life — it will be her GPS. Also, us ENFJ seem to learn really quickly. She will probably do some stupid things. But instead of getting mad at her, try asking questions to how she felt about what took place. 9 out 10 that will be more beneficial long run and short run in your relationship. \n\nPerhaps try really encouraging her to stand up for what she believes in; telling her being expressive isn’t wrong if you believe what you are saying. You don’t always have to please people. Sometimes you have to think about yourself, and ask do I really want to do this? Don’t shh up her when she just talks and talks— listen to what she is thinking and understand many times it’s her emotions talking rather her logic. \n\nAs far a sexual choices. I would tell her about people you know, to even yourself. How dating so young can really bring about heartbreak. That at her age, creating friends will help her slowly learn who she is more compatible with. And since she is such a social bird. Dating may limit that open web she so naturally creates with people. \n\nEveryone is different, but regardless. Us ENFJs are emotional beings. Fill up her emotion bank account up with love, support, and advice. Always be patient, and let her know you always have her back. So at least if something does go wrong, she will run to you, rather than someone else. Maybe it’s just me, but I have always loved facts. Why does this happen? How does this work... so instead of letting her learn the hard way by self discovery...give her a blue print of wisdom before hand...
1	I think you should be careful about parenting your child based on what mbti you think she is. If you are going to guess her type, you should wait until she is about 14 years old. I have known ENFPs, ESFJs, some ESFPs, and other non-ENFJs to be people pleasing as well. Reasons and with whom can vary for the different types.\n\nA lot of children want to fit in and please others, so that pressure can distort what a child is really experiencing within themselves. Behavior does not always equate with cognitive function, the deeper part of a person is usually what is on a conscious and subconscious level. Your daughter is still going through a lot of changes and is or about to enter puberty. (As you acknowledged)\n\nI don’t think you should use disappointment as a tool to get your daughter to listen. Every child desires some validation and acceptance by their parents, it’s rooted in a child’s need for their parents. I think using disappointment intentionally as a tool could potentially lead to her being secretive and depending on friendships more AND also confuse her what kind of parent you are.\n\nI think you need to establish some rules to keep her accountable, but more importantly you need to have a communicative relationship where it feels she has at least one parent as a friend. This allows her to open up when she feels inner conflict in her own time, as opposed to you constantly asking her or giving advice without really knowing what’s going on at school. Having an open relationship especially one where she won’t feel judged or disappointment for thinking about intimacy with boys and peer pressure situations can be healthy between her and you as a concerned parent. \n\nThe most important thing you can do as a parent is be a good role model, listen to what she has to say even if you don’t agree, if you are at fault for anything acknowledge it so that she does the same with you, give enough freedom to let her be a kid and discover herself, but still establish some  clear boundaries so that she recognizes you as parental authority. \n\nAs an ENFJ, I may have been a people pleaser my whole life, but I’m not conforming. I stopped being friends with people who I felt were not trustworthy, kind, or honest since elementary school. My mom thought she established the rule of “no dating,” but the truth is I had that rule for myself. Being introspective helped me to understand the unspoken things about people, as well as understand what was important to me. It’s really hard to know just by observing your kids and hearing things here and there. Some children are well behaved at home and act differently at school. \n\n
3	Understanding My ENFJ And His EX	Ok, when I first met my ENFJ he had just broken up with his girlfriend 2-3 months prior. (I did not know this at the time.) He simply referred to her as a “friend he knew”. As we got to know one another, he referred to her as his ex if she came up then eventually no longer referred to her at all.\n\nThree months into our friendship I told him if he ever wanted to take our friendship deeper then I would consider it and he answered, “I’m ashamed to say this but I’m still not over my last relationship.” (Again, I didn’t know they had basically just broken up.) Not a big deal to me; we kept on truckin’ XD\n\nA month after that, I gave him a deeply meaningful birthday gift. He made a video about it and did everything but tag her in a social media post to get her to look at it XD \n\nHere’s where I get confused: last weekend he left for a job out of town. She was working the same job (we’re all broadly in the same field, that wouldn’t be odd). He didn’t tell me. He didn’t mention it AT ALL but I don’t know why. He mentioned the other friend (the roommate) that would be there but not her. Pictures emerged and he’s awkwardly posed, almost like he’s trying to be friendly but wants to make it clear/obvious he’s not touching her but then he friended her on FB.\n\nHe sent me a quick text before he got back that he wanted to see me that week and he’d get in touch. He returned, texted me that he was swamped but wanted to make some time for me on Friday. He disappeared and reappeared on social media on an impromptu day off road trip (this guy plans everything meticulously, VERY out of character - although I’m glad he did it, he needed it).\n\nWe meet, he was so happy to see me. We talked and hugged and hugged and hugged some more. He patted my shoulder, he tousled my hair. We made plans to possibly consider merging our businesses in the future, etc. All he would tell me about the weekend was, “It was ok, could’ve been better. I was a bit depressed when I got back so decided to take a spontaneous road trip with friends. You should meet them! They’re so much like us!” Still never admitted to me she was there but then went and tagged each other in photos.\n\nTL;DR - ENFJ friend hid the fact that he worked with his ex (they’re still friends) over the weekend. I think he got hurt by something. Still won’t talk about it. I’m worried about him. Can I do anything for him to make it better or does he have to work this out on his own? How are ENFJs with exes if the ENFJ themself broke it off? I don’t want him to hurt :/ \n

2	Sounds like he still loves her and doesn’t feel comfortable talking about that part of his life with you.
8	How often do you give compliments to people?	Do you compliment any people or just close friends, and romantic relationship? I know an ENFJ that is always telling me how cute I look, and not sure how to take this. I don't considerate myself cute or maybe is just plain INFP cuteness  
8	I dont compliment people unless I mean it, if that's what you're asking! While every ENFJ is different, I personally don't trust people who give fake compliments (white lie = lie). That being said though, when someone impressed me or does something cool or looks genuinely cute, I don't hesitate to tell them. For example, today a co-worker of mine told a joke to me and a few others in the break room, and I told him "*person*, you are so funny. I'm pretty sure every convo I've ever had with you, you make me laugh." But I didn't tell him so that he liked me, I told him because I was impressed with him. \n\nTldr; only when they deserve them. If this ENFJ is like me, they must honestly find you cute. 
5	I LOVE to compliment someone that I feel actually took time to try and look good. I'm a girl and if I see another girl with bomb ass makeup or a cute dress I always try and let them know, in a non creepy way obviously. 
6	All the time but it’s always genuine and real. I always try to find something unique about a person be it the laugh they have or the professionalism of a new worker or the lipstick of the girl at Taco Bell. 
6	I follow the rule of “If I like something, say something.” Basically I’ll give a compliment whenever a chance for one comes along.
3	Quite often but only if I mean it. Most of them are on their qualities if they overcame something or worked hard but many are also on their physical features 
4	I compliment the heck out of people when they do good stuff. Positive reinforcement!
42	Anyone else noticed how the ENFJ sub is the friendliest sub on reddit? :)	It's true. I have lots of experience in other subreddits and no one's friendlier and cooler than here! 
43	No. Be quiet. We are mean. Rawr.
10	We just want everyone to be their best selves! 🤣
6	Everyone is especially very helpful on this sub too when someone has a question I find.
6	I don't see the point of being dick would help in any way.\n\nEverybody should just be a nice person.\n\nHuman decency is an important thing, love ourselves and love others.\n\nPEACE.
4	Lol iono about nice. I like being realistic and helpful... XD
5	We know what it is like to be unique and misunderstood. We wouldn’t wish that on anyone else. 
0	You're all conflict avoidant like hell is why.
5	Do you guys experience ASMR?	I was wondering if there’s a connection between personality type and sensitivity to ASMR. For me, I rarely get tingles but have had them about 3-5 times in my shoulders and back of my neck. I still watch it though because it’s super relaxing and I’m determined to train myself to get tingles! It would be really cool to see whether there’s any correlation! Any replies are appreciated! :)
3	I love asmr and listen to it frequently to  fall asleep. I get tingles from some triggers and not others. I should mention I only listen to the gentle whispering lady Maria. 
2	I get ASMR when I watch people draw. It's so relaxing. I've tried YT videos of it but it's not the same as just watching someone doodle irl. 
1	I dont get ASMR at all, it actually makes me cringe some times... Everyone is different though, if I'm going to listen to something I'd listen to some audio it'd be from like r/pillowtalkaudio or something\nEdit: spelling
1	Yeah. I use it to silence my mind while I try to sleep at night.  
9	Advice for approaching an INTJ (romantically)	Hey everyone! I'm an ENFJ and there's an INTJ guy who I find really cute. We already talk a lot and we get along quite well\-\-we have lots of mutual interests and enjoy bouncing ideas off each other. Still, I can often see his INTJ traits come out. I try not to take anything personally when he's short with me or super blunt, but sometimes it's difficult. I also try to flirt, but there's never any sign that he realizes it.\n\nAt least for me, I feel happiest when I see results from my interactions with people. If I can visibly make him happy or laugh or he flirts back, those are the things that will give me infinite joy. But...INTJ's aren't very expressive, so a lot of the time I'm either confused (like, does he like me back? is he bored by me?!) or my feelings get hurt by his short responses.\n\nI'm trying to see from his perspective\-\-INTJ's aren't emotional, they're short with people, etc., so it's to be expected. But...do you have any advice for coping with this? And also, do you have any advice for how I can get closer to him and how I should approach him about actually going on a date? I know I'll have to deal with these things even more if we're in a relationship, but I feel like at that point I can just be straightforward and say "xyz is bothering me".\n\nThanks so much, my brethren! :) 
8	Hey I’ve been married to an intj for 12 years, it definitely took some straightforwardness on my part in the beginning. He is slow to get around to things, so in his mind he liked me and things were progressing fine, where I needed more typical social cues. \n\nThey tend to think that thinking about doing something is the same as doing something, so he needed a little push from me to initiate a “wanna see a movie sometime?” \n\nThat being said, he’s my favorite person in the whole world and we’ve been together forever so ENFJ/INTJ can definitely work \n\nEdit to add, my husband loves to dispense advice or opinions, or if you ask him to teach you about something or give an opinion on something he’s interested in he feels very validated and connected 
4	ENFJ dating an INTJ here. Straight from the INTJ that I love very much:\n\n“I’d just say be upfront and ask him out. He won’t make the first move, but try not to be offended — doing so won’t change how he feels about you. I view people on a very binary scope; you’re either a potential mate or not. He’s already made a decision, whether you want to find out what that is is up to you.”\n\nMy ENFJ perspective:\n\nJust go for it. Ditto to my boyf, everything is a whole lot easier with their type if you’re bold. He’ll appreciate it when you speak your mind rather than be indecisive.\n\nGood luck! It can work! 💜\n
3	Ask if he wants to go hiking, or something like that next weekend. Drop that you’re gonna do something casually and be like “would you want to go?”
2	ENFJ with INTJ brother, hope I can help! Honestly, I think you just need to be up front with him. The fact you two talk a lot already and have common interests is a good sign to me, as INTJs generally prefer solitude. \nIt may well be he is oblivious to your flirting. Being Introverted Thinkers, emotional expression is hardly their strong suit. If he knows how you feel I'd say it's much more likely he will reciprocate your flirting. \n\nAs for arranging a date, I'd suggest doing something with him that you know he likes, which is possibly one of your shared interests? \nIf you don't feel comfortable alone in a 'date' situation just yet, I'd recommend a group setting with mutual friends to start out with and work from there. If he seems to spend more time engaging/listening to you, another great sign. \n\nI'm sure you are feeling nervous, but please don't worry! If it's meant to be, it'll be. What's to lose? Worst case scenario he doesn't feel the same and you guys continue being friends (albeit it may be slightly awkward at first but I have no doubt you'd get back to being friends again). I don't mean to worry you, I just don't want you to get your hopes up and be disappointed! I'd say this is unlikely though, it does sound as though he likes you back. Just take things as they come, it'll all work out in the end.\n\nGood luck and please let me know how things go! :) \n
2	Any updates??
4	Could I borrow your attention for a hot minute? ENFJ? was INFJ	I don’t know what to think! I typed as an INFJ for ten years and now I’m typing as an ENFJ. I honestly think it could be a fluke, but I am genuinely starting to question my own instincts.\n\nAs a kid I was rather sociable and creative. My ENFP mom really encouraged me to pursue art so that’s what I did. My kindergarten teacher felt that I talked too much to continue to the first grade so she tried to hold me back. I would get into arguments with kids that I perceived as bullies and I would always insert myself arguements and question adults. I had no problem whatsoever lecturing adults about being jerks. \n\nSometime between 6-13 years old I lost my social mojo and became very lost in my imagination. During that time these neighborhood boys took an interest in me and relentlessly creeped on me, my sister(ENFP) declares that she hated sharing friends with me, my parents married and then divorced and then married again, I moved to another state just to return years later, and I pretended to be a witch for a whole year(10-11y.o.) looking back I’m positive that I was depressed much of my childhood.\n\nI took my first MBTI test when i was fifteen. My psychology teacher paid for all of us to take the test and she was incredibly excited to find out that I was an INFJ. I think her enthusiasm somewhat made me want to be an INFJ. Heck I was pretty thrilled to know that the reason i felt so disconnected from my parents was that we had different communication functions. My parents are ENFP(mom)+ENTJ(dad)).\n\nAnyway, back on topic, how do I tell the difference between an INFJ and an ENFJ? I understand people usually say well do you like being around people and my answer to that question is “yes, but t depends on the people and atmosphere. I get easily drained by loud and negative atmospheres.” \n\nI feel like I’m pretty terrible at Ti  and Si/ I know that ENFJ’s have Polr Si, but what the heck is that? What’s Polr Te? \n\n\nIf it helps:\n\nMy big five scores are: O-80 C-52 E-46 A- 57 N-51\n\nMy similarminds jung test results\nFe-80\nNi-75\nSe-45\nTi- 65\n\nAnd then said ENFJ at the bottom. \n\nMy extroversion score on Big Five suggests that Im slightly more introverted than extroverted.\n\nErgh.\n\nTd;rl: what is it like having Polr Si and inferior Ti? How do you react to Te users? What makes an INFJ and an ENFJ easy to distinguish?
3	So, an easy way to figure this out would be to possibly look at your relationship with your parents. Socionics has in\-depth descriptions for the relations between each of the different types. INFJ, ENTJ, ENFJ, and ENFP in MBTI are INFp, ENTj, ENFj, and ENFp in Socionics, by the way.\n\nSo the Socionics relationship between INFp and ENTj is a supervisor\-supervisee relationship, with the ENTj being the supervisor. You may find it kind of painful to be in this relationship because Te is your weakest function \(PoLR function, since socionics believes you use all eight functions\) and ENTj's lead with Te. On the other hand, if you are an ENFj, then your relation with ENTjs will be a Business relation. It's a different dynamic.\n\nIf your parents have been typed correctly, then you can read up on the relationship descriptions and see which ones resonate with you most.\n\nIt seems that you don't have a very good grasp on socionics so I'll try to give a brief summary of the main concepts you need to know before looking deeper.\n\n1. In Socionics, you use all eight functions. Four are valued, four are unvalued. The four valued functions in socionics are the same as the four functions that MBTI uses. Therefore:\n\nINFJ \(MBTI\) functions: Ni, Fe, Ti, Se\n\nINFp \(Socionics\) valued functions: Ni, Fe, Ti, Se\n\n\(INFJ in MBTI = INFp in Socionics\)\n\n\-\-\-\n\n2. To figure out how to convert from MBTI to Socionics, change the last letter to lowercase and switch from "j" to "p" or from "p" to "j" if the type is introverted. If the type is extroverted, only change the last letter to lowercase.\n\nTherefore:\n\nINFJ in MBTI is the same as INFp in Socionics.\n\nENFJ in MBTI is the same as ENFj in Socionics.\n\n\-\-\-\n\n3. I said earlier the Socionics uses all eight functions. Just like MBTI has names for the position of the four functions it uses \(the top function is the dominant function, the second function is the auxiliary, and so on\), so does Socionics. Each function has a different role in each type, and the role of the function determines how it is used.\n\nThe roles are in order of strongest to least strongest:\n\nFOR VALUED FUNCTIONS: Leading \> Creative \> \> Mobilizing \> Suggestive\n\nFOR UNVALUED FUNCTIONS: Demonstrative \> Ignoring \> Role \> PoLR/Vulnerable\n\n\-\-\-\n\n4. Is there a shortcut for determining the unvalued functions of a type if you know the order of the four valued functions? Yes. Remember the order: 2\-1\-4\-3. To get the first unvalued function, change the **second \(2\)** function from introverted to extroverted or vice versa. To get the second unvalued function, change the \*first \(1\)\* function from introverted to extroverted or vice versa. To get the third unvalued function, change the \*fourth \(4\)\* function from introverted to extroverted or vice versa. To get the fourth unvalued function, change the \*third \(3\)" function from introverted to extroverted or vice versa.\n\nYou know the valued functions for INFJ/INFp are: Ni \> Fe \> Ti \> Se\n\nTherefore, the unvalued functions for this type are: Fi \> Ne \> Si \> Te\n\nThis means that for this type:\n\nNi = Leading, Fe = Creative, Ti = Mobilizing, Se = Suggestive and\n\nFi = Demonstrative, Ne = Ignoring, Si = Role, and Te = PoLR/Vulnerable\n\n\-\-\-\n\n5. Now you can do this for the other type you were looking into, ENFJ/ENFj. Read up on the roles and how each of the functions behave in those roles for a better idea of which type you are. I would also recommend reading the articles on the official Socionics website. I just wanted to make sure you were clear on the basics so you don't get too confused.
2	Personality hacker podcast has an episode on the differences between the two if you want to check it out
2	STOP EVERYTHING. STOP THIS FUCKERY. I've only heard the term "hot minute" ONCE in my life and it was from the ONLY ENFJ I know (side note, was madly in love with her, but I digress) WHAT KIND OF FREAKY COINCIDENCE IS THIS I AM TRIPPING OUT. Read this over twice to make sure it wasn't the same person.
1	Edit to fix Ti\Te error*
15	Hello fellow ENFJs! What's your career?	I'm in nursing and feel like it fits my MBTI perfectly! We're caring, empathetic, can speak out to advocate, and literally just get shit done lol. What about yall?

4	I am a teacher who did not enjoy the career and am about to finish my Masters in Business Administration.  I am focusing on supply chain where I can problem\-solve and figure out the most efficient ways to do things, which I enjoy.  I also will hopefully be in a managerial position to use those ENFJ leader/people skills!
3	I’m in staffing! I’m a technical recruiter, kinda like a lower level head hunter. \n\nGet to talk to lots of people, organize lots of things, and show people their potential...along with helping them develop professionally and typically arranging them with a job. \n\nIt took me a long time to figure out what I wanted to do and this has really been a great fit for my personality. 
3	I’m a Software Engineer, but I’ve never met any other ENFJs in my profession, or even any NFs. Anybody out there? \n\nOn paper my job doesn’t seem to fit my personality, but I love it!
3	I'm a Software Engineer! If I'm being modest, it's definitely not a natural fit. The work in itself isn't the most reward ing, the people I work with are mostly (80&#37; and above) are INTx, but I really enjoy the challenges it brings in the Thinking aspect, since I'm a highly dominant Feeler. This is only my first year in, and I'm already fantasizing about how much fun moving to management would be haha
2	I've worked a variety of jobs over the course of my life. When I was younger and traveled a lot, I worked all sorts of jobs. At one point I worked as a tree doctor in India, at another I worked as a spiritual tele-counselor in Iran, in another I worked at a wolf sanctuary in Norway. just to give you a few ideas. \n\nWhen it comes to my broader career, I am an [underground writer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clandestine_literature). I mainly write about various topics related to linguistics, mathematics, survivalism, religion, and philosophy. If it counts, I am also the father of six children (and counting) and that's definitely a big part of what I do, especially since my wife and I homeschool. 
2	I’m in education. Taught Middle school, then did curriculum writing and professional development. Now transitioning into School administration 
2	I’m studying psychology with the aim of getting into research!

1	College student starting PA school this Friday! \n\nTo be honest, I've always been second guessing my career, even recently. PA is pretty much all sciences and medical classes. I never had a natural ability for science and always enjoyed English Language Arts the most in high school. I would say I am a strong writer and enjoy crafting abstract thoughts into words. It's what I credit to me being a good communicator and being very social. However, I am driven for this path because I enjoy the social side of it. Having someone thank you for your efforts and leave happily is what I hope for. No matter how many sleepless nights it took or how much stress it caused, knowing that I could help a little would make it all worthwhile.\n\nThank you for posting this. I always thought about what other ENFJs had for their careers so I'm glad to see these responses and more glad to know someone else is in the medical field as well :\)

16	Do any other ENFJs do this?	So I’ve taken the MBTI test a few times and have gotten ENFJ every time. Everything is pretty much me to a tee, but there’s one thing I don’t see mentioned.\n \nMy desire for everyone to have the best time possible leads to arguments. So for example I’ll often try and micromanage my friends so everyone gets a go on a video game for example, or I’ll plan out what we’re going to do (with the help of others) just so everyone can feel included and have fun. However I often find that this can clash with other personality types- some of my friends get annoyed when I do this. This leads to me trying to defend myself and then getting emotionally worked up- thinking I’ve hurt my friend’s feelings. After we’ve effectively gone past it and we’ve all gone home,   I’ll still find myself apologising to them because I have a major desire to be liked.\n\nAlso, I have a personal conflict between the truth and making sure I’m liked. If someone denies something that I know to be true, I’ll do one of two things: I’ll either concede the argument to them but be gutted on the inside that they’re gonna not know the truth or debate it with them (I have a passion for debating haha) and then worry that I’ve hurt their feelings and apologise profusely.\n\nAlso, am I the only one that feels like we don’t deserve all the praise ENFJs get? Not you guys, you’re awesome. But looking over my results I felt so arrogant reading over the big about selflessness haha.\n\nAnyway, I’m so glad we’ve got this community! It’s really cool to see so many (or maybe not haha) people who are like me! You guys rock :)\n\nTL;DR: 1: Desire for everyone to have a good time leads to arguments \n\n2: There’s an inner conflict between wanting everyone to know the truth and wanting people to like us \n\n3: A pretty good debating ability and ability to express our viewpoints\n\n4: I feel arrogant reading over the ENFJ trait sheet \n\n5: you guys are cool (not necessarily an enfj trait but still true)\n\nEDIT: haha thanks for all the replies guys! What I’ve picked up on most is that people are saying that these things are prevalent but became less obvious with age! I’m 17, so that does make sense to me! I am going to try and make an effort to not try and control events as much, maybe next time I’ll only intervene if I can see someone is being left out - or I’ll ask if everyone’s doing good. Honestly, I really appreciate these replies and am so happy I got so many responses and varied (maybe not this haha) opinions!
4	1. Well I really can't say I'm a good harmonizer, if there's one, that'll be my INFP friends. They are far better at dealing with arguments than me, I avoid them as much as possible if arguments are pointless.\n\n2. I can't care less whether people like me or not. \n\n3. Yes I am. But there's no point debating with irrational/illogical people, debate is based on rationality. \n\n4. I... don't?\n\n5. Cool people are cool, stay with cool people.  
2	I’m Infj, but we share the same first four CF’s. I do understand what you are saying and I can say I have had similar conflicts.  I think you will develop more with time and the intensity of your conflicts will be less of an issue. 
2	Hi, fellow debater and micro-manager here! I'm a massive worrier that people aren't having a good time so I'll try and plan things and fuss over shit. I also love having a vague schedule, so if I go away with a group of friends/partner I like to make a list of must-sees and then LOOSELY base our day around that. Sometimes you have to learn to let things go over your head and loosen up a little, people will tend to see to themselves if they need or want something. \n\nThe desire to be liked by everyone as an ENFJ is unreal, but I feel as life goes on you kinda get over this - I'm definitely okay if I'm not liked by certain people. I'm not very good at biting my tongue if I disagree with somebody - but it really depends on the dynamic of the relationship with the person I'm debating with. If we're close and I know how they react to debates, I'll usually speak up and challenge them. If I don't know the person all that well, I'll probably tread lightly and test the waters first before going all in haha.\n\nDon't worry too much! Totally relate-able. :) 
2	I absolutely love to read ENFJ's writing. My smile is nice and wide. \n+1 for the TLDR
1	Also ENFJ Here..  \n1. So I can agree that I've had a tough time in learning how to manage people's good times. Especially when they come over and I am hosting them. But what I've learned to do, rather than to micromanage each situation, I a\) make sure the group likes each other enough and b\) settle on creating the conditions for good times. What I've found is that if you lay the land well enough, each person's motivation to enjoy themselves takes over, thereby taking the responsibility away from me, as well as having me take the credit for it internally.  \n2. Can agree with this. Truth wins everytime. You know why, because of the quality of people. People that don't allow us to be our truthful selves by judging and downvoting us in real life are kinda a real pain for me personally as an ENFJ. They are too much to manage, so I stay with the quality folk who allow me to have the truth freely.  \n3. Yes. Love a good debate.  \n4. Hmmm... I don't know. I feel like wearing them as badges.
1	I definitely have seen this behavior in ENFJs I know and also partook of it myself in my more youthful days \(and fall into it on rare occasion, especially with very old friends\). To me the key in altering my own behavior \(once it's clear it's not eliciting the joyful social experiences you're going for\) is by recognizing the implicit authority I'm demanding in my attempts to be 'aggro' helpful and likable. I didn't just want them to have a good time \- I wanted them to have a good time because of something I did, and that's 100&#37; not the same thing and not nearly as selfless or effective.   \n\n\nIt comes with age, and with giving yourself permission to be a quiet authority \( help by listening vs trying to helping while feeding your need for authority, with either debate or 'You know what you should do..'\). You'll also find your ability to elicit positive change in others will improve dramatically \(which at least for my ENFJ brain, are the best good feels\) when you make it known you disagree, but don't get into the debate trap when it's clear those you're debating with are just looking to feed their own authority needs \(Try not to bother with 'I'm right vs I'm right', as this isn't great social fuel for ENFJ. Wait for people to be in a questioning state and because your presence in their life is a less needy, silent authority, they'll come to you seeking knowledge and empathy instead of debate\).  \n\n\nNot that you directly requested advice on cultivating change in these patterns. But that's the path I've found most satisfying. 
1	I...don't feel this way! Lol. When it comes to conflict and difficult situations, I turn into an INTJ.\n\nI generally assume that everyone's having fun if they're not speaking up! I also hate planning things (get-togethers and outings), so - if someone isn't having fun, it's on the planner! But mostly - I don't feel guilty about leaving out people that I dislike! For example, I just organized plans to hang out with some of my friends and intentionally left out a clingy acquaintance (who believes, for some reason that we're close friends) from being invited. I don't LIKE this person, so I don't care much about them liking me! Instead, I just hope that don't find out about the plans, and if they do - eh, I've given them enough hints already suggesting that I don't like being around them!\n\nI know. Savage, but alas - sometimes you have to put yourself first.
1	I do experience the things you described, but maybe not to the same degree as you. I went through a lot when I was young, and helped me mature quickly. \n\nI don’t think you should micromanage your friends. I like everyone to be included too,A LOT. I think you should recognize your friends have the awareness to include everyone and aren’t against you in where you stand. If you are micromanaging though, you took it as your responsibility and in a way are controlling the taking turns thing. I think it can be annoying for others because although you have good intentions your controlling like behavior makes them not only feel distracted from having a good time, but also like their children who are unable to play fairly with others. Maybe the guy who wins 3 consecutive rounds felt he should be able to play everyone for winning, but he will probably get off. That’s just an example I threw in. I know it hurts to be called “controlling” for micromanaging. It doesn’t make you a bad person and everyone at some point exhibits controlling like behavior in one form or another, simply because not everyone thinks like you or does things like you. It is when a person tries to control people and situations all the time when it becomes very serious, especially if you have boundary issues.\n\nIt’s okay to not be liked by everyone. It could just be the case that they like you overall as a person, but some things they are bothered by. In all fairness, you will also feel that way about others. If people don’t like you despite their kindness, those people don’t deserve you anyways. \n\n
1	this sounds like self fulfilling prophecy from reading too much about Ti-grip
11	How do ENFJs deal with people?	INTP here. Tell me how all you ENFJs deal with people, since we both have Extroverted Feeling in our primary functions, but yours is more developed. It would be very helpful to me. Thanks.
23	My typical approach with basically all people is “how can I help them, how can I love them” — pretty cliche but that’s the general mindset, even when loving and helping is difficult. 
21	I’m generally able to understand all walks of life and perspectives even if I don’t personally agree with it. Extremists of all kind are included in this. I tend to look at how people come into their perspectives holistically, from a societal/cultural/socioeconomic/familial upbringing as well as individualistic standpoint, and because of that it’s a lot easier to understand even the most disagreeable of perspectives. I am able to listen to these perspectives and nod without feeling as though our differences is an attack on my beliefs. I tend to only feel that way unless there is an intentional, deliberate violence, moreso on others I care about. And when that happens you don’t want to be there to see me detonate. \n\nI am generally looked at to be the leader of group causes of which I am part, even if I don’t want to be, and most of the time I don’t. I tend to come off more confident than I inherently feel and as a result people look to me to get shit done. If I do take up a leadership position, I tend to lead through uplifting and gentle encouragement rather than by dragging someone into what I think is best for them. \n\nI can make or break the energy in any room. I am also able to size someone up within the first few minutes of meeting them. Most of the time I feel like I have a subconscious radar. I tend to know what people are thinking or feeling without them having to say it. My intuition has the observation skills of a surveillance camera and notices absolutely everything about a person when they communicate with or around me. I 100% keep these hunches/observations to myself because it would scare people otherwise/make them uncomfortable, and making people comfortable is kind of my mantra. Because of this, people’s actions or life decisions taken after I meet them generally don’t surprise me. I am rarely surprised by people. \n\nI don’t poke or pry when someone is obviously lying or battling with inner demons or generally a self conscious person. I acknowledge people have their reasons for undesirable actions or self-talk and try to work with them instead of use it against them, if they want me to (and people tend to want me to) and don’t appear to have malicious intent towards me (which, again, I am usually able to sniff out if they do). However, “out of power”/broken ENFJs will feel and do the opposite with these gifts and are not people you want in your vicinity. 
9	I try to lead by following. I’m usually leader of whatever group/function/project and I always try to bring out the best in others.\nI try to get them to be more passionate about themselves and what they’re doing.\nI take control if truly I need to but I really try to feign relinquishing power to others so they rise more. 
3	My approach is just to find out what makes them happy and try to make them as happy as possible. If they have a glaring flaw, I usually tell myself that I probably had that flaw at one point in my life and I shouldn't discriminate them based on it. It works and helps me become more tolerant and understanding with people. 
2	INTPs have extroverted feeling? \n\nTo deal with people is to deal with problems, and problems need solutions. \n\nEach problem has a specific solution towards it. People are the same, different people with different solutions. \n\nThere's not a universal way to deal with people, you treat them, they treat you back. You dismay them, they dismay you back. Sometimes common folks tend to retaliate worse than the attacker.\n\nBut there's a rule of thumb—**treat people as how you want to be treated, with generosity, decency and genuineness. If people are bad to you, tolerate them a little bit, if they persist, you retaliate back, but not with huge retaliation, but small retaliations that remind them you're not to be trifled with.**
2	What do you mean by "deal with people"?
5	ENFJ and 2w3?	upon researching for a bit I've noticed many people who fall under the ENFJ myer\-briggs personality type also tend to be 2w1/2w3 on the enneagram test. Has anyone has results that don't follow this archetype?
2	Yes! I’m a 3w2 :D so not too different, but I hear there are type 8 ENFJs as well, as described in this post: https://www.stellarmaze.com/enfj-mad-bad-and-dangerous-to-know/ 
2	I'm 8w7 haha
2	1w2 but I’m trying to change that LOLOLLL 
2	It’s important to remember that while many ENFJs obviously have connection-focused fears and motivations (which fits 2 perfectly), women are typically conditioned in general to think like 2s, so women are more likely to test that way. Especially women that are sensitive to the expectations of others (i.e. extroverted feelers).\n\nVaguely unrelated, but it was helpful for me to realize, since I originally tested as a 2, but it has become much more apparent over the years that I am a 7 that was conditioned by my family to step in and take care of everyone when my mother passed away. Other ENFJs I know are either 2s or 6s. 
1	Yeah you're right, for me \(ENFJ f\)\n\n \- I'm "2w1" first, and "2w6" a very close 2nd,
1	Nope. I'm a 2w3, enfj.\n\nCan you share where your info is from? I'd like to learn more.
1	I'm a 2W3 also ahah!
1	2w3 here!
1	I’m a 7w8, but I have read a fair amount of Enneagram/MBTI analyses that say type 2 is far and away the most likely Enneagram type for ENFJs. The gender aspect is interesting; maybe more ENFJs are 2s than 8s or 7s since the majority of ENFJs are female. 
1	That's because ENFJ in MBTI is stereotyped as "Helper" personalty, which falls in line with 2w3. It also makes some 2w3s mistype as ENFJs even though they are other personality types like ISFJ, ESFP, or INFJ - they identify with the helper moniker through their enneagram type!
3	Beautiful ENFJs please help me get closure!	Hello you amazing people :D\n\nEarly 20s INTP male here, was in a long term relationship with a very sweet and charismatic ENFJ girl that ended almost 4 years ago (yikes!). \n\nShe ended the relationship over a phonecall, I went full no contact and we've only seen each other once on accident since then. In that brief meeting I told  her I didn't blame her for ending the relationship and apologized for some of my immaturity (I cried and said stupid things on that phonecall, big regret).\n\nRecently, I've had the urge to sit down with her and talk about what happened between us. We had a great time together and a series of unfortunate family situations messed with my mental health which put great stress on the relationship (and an unnecessary amount of stress on her, I should've seen a therapist).\n\nMy desire for meeting up is probably fleeting, but I never got a real closure on the relationship and I still wish the circumstances around the breakup were different. \n\nWould you as an ENFJ be open to talking openly with an ancient bf/gf? Please be honest (brutally if you must) and I look forward to hearing from y'all.
10	I know the way I am, I tend to move on once I've moved on. I dont really want to hear from any Exes from the past that I didnt stay friends with. Yes I stay friends with some of my exes...\n\nI dont like confrontation, especially if its not something important from my past that isn't affecting me anymore...\n\nthat being said... If I know someone is truly suffering, I will do what needs to be done to hear them out. Initially I will not be comfortable. and then once the conversation gets rolling I'll just do my best to let them know, its OK. and then probably offer suggestions to help them move forward. hah. 
6	ENFJ girl here. All ENFJ’s are different in their preferences and what their comfortable with. For myself I am always giving people second chances (to a fault) so me personally would always be willing to sit down and hear someone’s thoughts or their feelings. That being said, if I knew the relationship was never going to work, I would never string someone along after the conversation because that would be totally unfair to them. I would listen, offer comfort and forgiveness, but tell them straight up that we would never be romantically involved in the future. On the flip side if I felt there was potential, I would make that clear as well and then proceed accordingly. \n  Like I said though, every ENFJ is different. My advice to you for what it’s worth is if this thing is weighing on your heart then you should do something about it. It never hurts to ask her. The worst she can do is say no. And if it provides you closure then it’s worth it. If you’re being open and honest right up front I’ve never known an ENFJ to be mean or reject someone who is just seeking to make amends. \n

3	Not really, whenever things passed, they passed.\n\nSpecially for things that had an end, there's no point into pursuing something that already ended right?\n\nSometimes I wonder, the damage I dealt to people, it's always there. If they can forgive me, that's the best, but whoever did not forgive me, they have yet to contact me back, right?\n\nWhat's past is past. Nothing to regret, nothing to look forward to. \n\nAs far as I know, if the relationship can sustain, I will keep it, if I tried and it just can not sustain, there's nothing I can do, give up on it, ignore it, they don't deserve you and you deserve better.\n\nABCDEFG man, there's a greater pond out there.

6	Problems with learning foreign languages	I'm an ENFJ, and I've always had difficulty learning foreign languages to fluency \(I'm a native English speaker\). I'll look at some of the issues I have, and try to analyze the reasons. I'd like to see if others here have the same issues. They are:\n\n1. I'm perfectionistic, and afraid of saying the wrong thing and appearing stupid.\n2. For me, it's very important to manage my conversations, which I primarily do with language, but which I cannot do very well with an inadequate second language. So I feel like I'm not in control.\n3. I have a hard time being consistent in my study.\n4. The language just doesn't seem as useful as English.\n\nSome of the reasons I've figured \(mostly relating to my type\):\n\n1. Speaking a foreign language gives me anxiety.\n2. The foreign language is not really a *thing* in my social circle, so there's basically no social reinforcement for it. So while my auxiliary Ni might think of the foreign language as a neat, cool project, my dominant Fe has a hard time seeing the point.\n3. When I do have an opportunity to speak, the other person will often slow down for me or switch to English. This informs my dominant Fe that my ability in the language is clearly inadequate.\n4. The anxiety perhaps comes from my inferior Ti which feels inadequate in its knowledge of the language and fears the embarrassment that would result from having that inadequacy revealed.\n5. My tertiary Se does think speaking the language is fun, but wants to feel like it's in the driver's seat, which the failure of my knowledge in the language interferes with.\n\nAnyone else have similar experiences?
7	First, \n\nfuck all of these:\n> The foreign language is not really a thing in my social circle, so there's basically no social reinforcement for it. So while my auxiliary Ni might think of the foreign language as a neat, cool project, my dominant Fe has a hard time seeing the point.\nWhen I do have an opportunity to speak, the other person will often slow down for me or switch to English. This informs my dominant Fe that my ability in the language is clearly inadequate.\nThe anxiety perhaps comes from my inferior Ti which feels inadequate in its knowledge of the language and fears the embarrassment that would result from having that inadequacy revealed.\nMy tertiary Se does think speaking the language is fun, but wants to feel like it's in the driver's seat, which the failure of my knowledge in the language interferes with.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSecond, you have clearly pointed out the issues yourself. May I ask what is your preferred language you're learning now?\n\n> afraid of saying the wrong thing and appearing stupid.\n\nThis is what makes it difficult.\n\n> not in control.\n\nNot in control comes from various reasons, your social anxiety, which most of us ENFJs possess; your in-fluency for the language, there's no way other than practice practice and practice to increase your fluency of the language; and your understanding for the language.\n\n>a hard time being consistent in my study.\n\nChronic procrastination eh? Well if you want to learn something, stay strong, stay consistent, and fuck all the distractions. Get a buddy who can learn with you, or find people that speak that specific language and **chat** with them.\n\n>The language just doesn't seem as useful as English.\n\nThis is bullshit. Cut it. No language is useless. Even though you think they are not as useful right now as English, *well, of course, the States' influence is not to be taken lightly, every conflicted area speaks English in order to attract international attention, BUT, it's changing, apparently, the global political climate.* They are still somehow legacies of the different cultures. You may want to learn Romanic and Germanic languages first since they are much easier for native English speakers to learn like German, French and Spanish etc. Chinese, Japanese or even Korean are too hard at first, but over time you will find the rhythm. I had a hard time learning English as well, and I had endured similar situations like yours, people around me did not speak English at all. I immersed all my time into English and English alone, everything surrounded me was in English. \n\nHowever, even if this was the case, I still managed to learn some other languages as well like Japanese, Korean, Russian, French. Although very rudimentary, well, lack of practice and native speakers, but, it's fun. \n\nA language is a representation of a culture behind. If you are completely not interested into the culture behind, I'm sure the language study isn't going to go well for you as well. Language talents are possessed by most, if not only, ENFJs. But it is up to you, to handle this gift. \n\nUse your curiosity as a weapon, and let it pave ways for your study. To learn, is to fulfill curiosities. And I think this may help you in the long run of absorbing more knowledge.\n\nCheers.
3	INFJ here, but I have similar experience with languages. English is not my first language and I feel really insecure about it. I'm a perfectionist as well and I'm always scared of using the wrong words. I also want to learn another language, but I don't really see the point of it, as you mentioned...
2	>  I'm perfectionistic, and afraid of saying the wrong thing and appearing stupid.\n\n Most people will like it when someone talks to them in their native language. It would be very unlikely for them to judge you in a negative \n way for making a mistake. Most will either overlook them, or point them out to you in a nice way, so you don't make them again.\n Generally, people are very enthusiastic about their mother tongue, so they will encourage you learning it.\n \n> I have a hard time being consistent in my study.\n\nGood thing is, you don't _really_ have to study the language. You can just try to use it whenever you can. Think in that language, speak to yourself in that language, watch youtube videos in that language, play games in that language etc. Use it, have fun with it, and you'll automatically get better (Don't use this to say you don't need to study tho)\n\n> The language just doesn't seem as useful as English.\n\nHaving a second language can be extremely helpful. Not just in communicating with other people, you can access way more data, do more things that are behind a language barrier or just generally know way more about languages (deriving words, words in one language don't exist in another one, understand language better as a whole due to more perspectives). It's also something to show off. I could go on forever.\n\n> Speaking a foreign language gives me anxiety\n\nYou should probably do something about that lol\n\n>The foreign language is not really a thing in my social circle, so there's basically no social reinforcement for it. So while my auxiliary Ni might think of the foreign language as a neat, cool project, my dominant Fe has a hard time seeing the point.\n\nYou could try to find a social circle where that foreign language is a thing\n\n>  When I do have an opportunity to speak, the other person will often slow down for me or switch to English. This informs my dominant Fe that my ability in the language is clearly inadequate\n\nTell them how you want them to talk. As I said before, people are very enthusiastic about their mother tongue, so they'll probably want to help you.\n\n> The anxiety perhaps comes from my inferior Ti which feels inadequate in its knowledge of the language and fears the embarrassment that would result from having that inadequacy revealed.\n\nWhenever you notice something that feels off or inadequate, try to find out the truth. You could look it up or think about why it is wrong/correct (apple tree? doesnt sound right... it's a tree with apples... oh no, it is correct!) (but I feel this is more of an ENTP-thing).\nAlso, I'm pretty sure the only one having any expectations, is you. It would be weird if you got everything right.\n\n[not sure if you just wanted to vent a little since you asked for experiences, rather than advice. Also take my responce with a grain of salt, since I'm only 16 and the only foreign language I learned/am learning is english]\n
2	ENFJ here! Nope, I don't have those problems. I love practicing and learning foreign languages. \n\nAll of your concerns are valid and useful to lay out like this, but they may not be particular to ENFJs. Still, I'm just one, so it'd be useful to hear others' thoughts.
6	Leadership?	I've often heard that ENFJ's make for good leaders, but I definitely feel more like a follower than a leader. I prefer being given directions and carrying them out, listening to others instead, etc. But ultimately overall I prefer working alone. Is this normal for an ENFJ at times??
11	Ive once heard that ENFJs don't really crave for their authority very much (while they still likely feel more comfortable when the things with people are somewhat organized/controllable than when those are in chaos), but that ENFJs' spontaneous Minions make them be their leader by worshiping them.... Xd maybe I'm wrong about it though, while being you as you want to be, maybe there'd be sprung minions on your way path......? (source : me : kinda unreliable lol)
8	I’d say even when Im consciously trying not to be a leader I become one unofficially, but don’t actively seek leadership roles in a ordained sense. I’d rather not take on all the responsibility of a manger role but typically run the show behind the scenes by influencing managers anyhow. 
3	I think that it honestly comes down to what we as individuals prefer to do. I personally find that, while I'm happy to let other people take the lead, I naturally find myself taking initiative and have a large amount of experience as a leader, so I'm inclined to take leadership roles.\n\nSimilarly, an ENFJ's emotional intelligence and understanding of others lends itself toward a democratic leadership type, which has been shown more productive and more liked as a leadership style compared to the alternatives\n\n(Lippitt and White, 1943)
3	I think sometimes greatness is thrust upon us, and it is fight or flight. If you fight enough, it is like second nature!
3	I feel inevitable to take leadership role since everything I see is drifting away from the right course.\n\nI think I was pretty much the same like everyone else here, who does not particularly attend for authority. \n\nWell... sometimes you have to admit people are suckers and they need to be led.\n\nPeace out.
2	I am an ENFJ and seek out leadership opportunities, but I don't like being the president.
2	Yes, it's fairly normal.  Whether or not you prefer to take on a leadership role depends a great deal on your subtype.
2	I used to feel the same way about leadership until pretty recently! It’s said that ENFJ’s are “social leaders” who often organise group events, but I thought that wasn’t me at all! I rarely organise the events that my friend group and I do. \n\nStory:\n\nI bought this point up with my group of friends (there were about 12 of us out for drinks/lunch) and then my ENTJ friend was like “are you serious? Look around you! You have got everyone’s attention right now. You have started this entire discussion on personality type and it is so typical of you to spark topics of interesting conversation. You are absolutely a leader in our group!” And then I laughed so hard because she was so right and it was such an epiphany for me!\n\nSo yea I actually am a leader, in more of a motivational kind of way I guess?
2	I feel the same way. I think my strength comes from being a follower, because that Judging trait is really useful for the nitty gritty logistics stuff.\n\nLike others here, from experience, leadership is just something you're thrust into by accident.\n\n> I’d say even when Im consciously trying not to be a leader I become one unofficially, but don’t actively seek leadership roles in a ordained sense. I’d rather not take on all the responsibility of a manger role but typically run the show behind the scenes by influencing managers anyhow. \n\nMy experience in being a follower is that there are many leaders with talent and intelligence, however they're lacking in aspects like sociability and assertiveness, which is where I usually come in. The leader comes up with the vision and ideas, and I try to implement it.
4	Some issues with enfj, and I’d like to ask for advices	Hey guys, so I’m an ENFP, and this might be a bit rude, but I have some difficulties with ENFJ mom. \n\nso she is very very passionate and emotional and sorta “bossy” , loves to assume lots of things and judge them. But I really really disliked to be judged and be told what I should do, bcz I’m 24! And seriously , everyone can have different lifestyle and still handling it well! But she shows lots of disapproval abt my choices. I just get irritated easily when someone judges without trying to know my reasons or my logical thinking . And she just subconsciously assumes her opinions are more superior than my thorough thoughts in my brain abt my choices . So she interrupts me before I really finish my sentences and explanations. And then I get irratited to her, she gets hurt. And since she is hurt , I feel bad. \n\nI’m pretty open minded and I mostly respect people’s opinions. So let’s clarify if there’s someone who wants to give me opinions with calm and logical points , I really appreciate it. But if someone is being emotional and wants me to “correct “my opinion almost every time we have different views. That really makes me annoyed.\n\n I’d admit this is my biggest weakness, that I can’t stand or tolerate people being too emotional or judemental.\n\nSo my question is how should I react to this situation ? How to keep peace or get along with ENFJ mom? Without making she feel bad or hurt. Thanku!  :)
3	My biggest tip to handle anyone that gives you unwanted advice;\n\nJust say thanks!\n\nAll they want to do is help. Why not give them the recognition. That's just her way of caring. \n\nJust because you say thanks, doesn't mean you have to follow her opinion.
2	You can't change your mom.  You can only change yourself - your choices, or your beliefs.\n\nOne option is for you to set boundaries.  For example, if your mom starts lecturing you and you're not interested in having that conversation, you can say, "Mom, let's change the subject."  If she continues, then enforce the boundary: "I asked you to stop talking about that.  I'm going to hang up/leave the room now.  Talk to you later."  And then follow through.  Remember that something is only a boundary if there is a consequence when the other person crosses it.  It's not about controlling or manipulating the other person's behavior, but rather about choosing how you will respond to something that you don't like or want.\n\nThe second option you have is to change your mindset.  For example, you could do some self-exploration to see why you react more negatively to "emotional" advice rather than "logical" advice.  Maybe you could practice translating the emotional advice in your head to something more dispassionate.  Give yourself a moment before reacting to work through your feelings about what she's saying/doing, and see if you can put your own spin on it or see it from a different perspective that doesn't cause you as much discomfort.  In my experience I've found that employing the "duct tape" method (making myself pause, breathe, and listen open-mindedly before responding) has also succeeded in making the other person more patient and respectful as the conversation continues.
1	Something else I thought of.\n\nI like to help people navigate their lives, especially as I'm good at big picture objectives. It's really frustrating when I watch someone struggling and I can see an "easy" solution. I know that at the end of the day you can only lead a horse to water, but knowing the other person is struggling and self inflicting further stress gives me so many negative emotions that I really don't know how to handle it. Literally. It's an overload of emotion that I can't switch off from or fix. I try every trick in my book, mostly talk based and can become manipulative when nothing else works. I have to consciously stay away from flat out insults when nothing sticks, because that's just a desperate attempt to shake the other person up. I would bloody well strap an IV to that horse if he isn't drinking... but you can't do that to humans... lol\n\nIf your mum is too controlling and opinionated, the best things for her to hear might include;\n\nAcknowledgement of her care for you. Reminders that you need to make your own mistakes to learn a lesson. Reminders that fate will make everything right in the end. Reminder that there is no "right" way to live. Briefly explain your mbti, and how you have different end goals/ways of living. J vs P - plans make you feel suffocated, because your goal in life is to explore everything. ENTPs frustrate me when I realise that they plan for fun and not to actually follow through. It makes me wonder what the hell they're doing with their lives because they aren't really going anywhere! (Or so it seems to me). But as long as you can support yourself and don't rely on your mum for everything, then that's perfectly acceptable. 
1	>But she shows lots of disapproval abt my choices.\n\nDoes she do it to show her opinion on the topic, or does she do it to prepare for the harsh realities of life? If it is her own opinion on things, and you do not want her opinion, tell her. What you may want is her support, not opinion, tell her exactly that. There are two types of listeners, those who listen and agree and those who try to solve your problem. Maybe you ned the first, and she does the latter.\n\nIf she judges your behaviour, life choices etc... in order to prepare you for the harsh realities of life, then you could just as easily talk to her about it. Say, you already went through all the negative voices in your own head, you do not want your mother to add to those voices of doubt and negativity.\n\nDo not forget to remind your mother that having different opinions on things does not mean you have bad relationship as a parent and a child. After all, you wish the best for each other and have more or less same foundations about life.\n\nThe tl;dr is she probably has best intentions, but is stressed enough to not notice how she treats her dearest child. Talk talk talk :\)
1	Relationship with parents is definitely different from other kinds of relationships. She might see you a certain way and is trying to keep you in line. \n\nI’m surprised your mom is ENFJ though. She sounds like an SJ in Keirsey temperament. Maybe she’s ESFJ... ESFJs, ENFPs, and some ESFPs, can get mistyped for ENFJ. ESFJs are Feeling extroverted dominant like ENFJ. However, SJs tend to give off a vibe of being right. Or maybe her supporting functions could be underdeveloped. ENFJs tend have an openness to teaching their child, they try to be nurturing of individuality while still maintaining a healthy family. \n\nIn response to your situation. It’s cultural, personality, and role in relationship at play here. I struggle with my mom as well. She strongly believes in her perceptions about me and my siblings that she cannot accept any good thing we do to please her. I use to fight back more when I was younger, but I learned to accept that my mom is like this and I can listen to her patiently. Then share how I have lived and made my decisions. Which she always rejects like she didn’t hear anything. I observe her behavior as being selfish and needy, but she’s not going to acknowledge or change that. \n\nFind things in her expectations that you can agree or partly agree with. Tell her about things you’ve done that helps her see you do think about those things. Sometimes mother’s act critical out of neediness and worry. She could be worried about your judgement and maturity. Other than being patient, sharing what she’s only interested in, and trying to understand her— love her. Make her feel like she’s still your mom even while your becoming your own man. It could help her relax. \n
18	ENFJ suitable careers?	what do you guys do as a career? what do you like/dislike about it as far as being an ENFJ? \n\npersonally, i’m going into special education and behavior analysis for children with autism. \n\n
12	I struggled for quite some time trying to find a suitable career for myself as I felt nothing really resonated with me for the longest time. I Started off studying engineering for a bit but didn't really enjoy it. I did enjoy the creative process and being able to work with people though. After some time off school I discovered industrial design and now I'm going into a good university and studying design! \n\nWhat I dislike about being an ENFJ is how we aren't exactly analytical thinkers, we think more so emotionally. I bring this up because although someone who is an ENFJ can certainly go into careers that involve a lot of calculations and logical computations we just aren't naturally good at it. Trying to pursue careers that involve work like that feels like a constant uphill battle. Don't get me wrong it's definitely doable and ENFJs who do go into those careers can certainly excel but it’s more difficult for us as we are naturally better at thinking emotionally and feeling things. My only gripe with this is it seems most high paying careers nowadays are all in the STEM industry so being a more analytical thinker is somewhat favourable. \n\nWhat I do love about being an ENFJ though is our ability to just seem to work well with everyone. Networking is a huge key to finding a good career and you could argue that being the natural born extroverts that we are it can be easier for us to connect with people and work our way up into valuable career positions. On top of that because we are emotional thinkers and feelers careers that involve helping people and working along side people such as your career or careers in health care are very good for ENFJ types and they can be quite lucrative too 😝.\n\n\np.s - Its not all about the money though, follow your passion and interests but dont completely ignore money either.\n\n(typing on phone sorry for any typos)\n\n
3	I've worked a variety of jobs over the course of my life. When I was younger and traveled a lot, I worked all sorts of jobs. At one point I worked as a tree doctor in India, at another I worked as a spiritual tele-counselor in Iran, in another I worked at a wolf sanctuary in Norway. just to give you a few ideas. \n\nWhen it comes to my broader career, I am an [underground writer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clandestine_literature). I mainly write about various topics related to linguistics, mathematics, survivalism, religion, and philosophy. If it counts, I am also the father of six children (and counting) and that's definitely a big part of what I do, especially since my wife and I homeschool. 
3	I work in HR. I think it kinda reaches out to the empathetic part of me, plus I’m hella organised and love admin. 
3	I’m an anthropologist. I get to explore all these communities, rituals, practices etc that interest me and immerse myself in them. I love meeting new people and understanding why they do what they do, and how different cultures can offer novel ways of imagining society and the future. I’ve studied witchcraft, movement medicine, artists that use digital technologies to make art, hacker culture... I also love writing and reading theory. I know a lot of languages and have always traveled so it comes naturally to me, and I’m excited about getting to go into the field for research intermittently throughout my life.
3	I'm an assistant director in the film industry. As an AD we manage people on set, make sure everything goes according to schedule and that we don't go over the budget. It's us who bind the different departments all together. I'm still in the training process, but I love being busy on set. I also get to interact with all the people in the crew. There are times when things are going south and we are expected to keep everyone calm, and it can be difficult. But, it sets a precedent for others to see you in a collected temperament, and it's rewarding (for me anyway) whenever someone tells me that I have a friendly demeanor and they like working with me because of that. It makes for better connections and I get to make friends in every show I work in. It's a cut throat industry for sure, but having the emotional intelligence to deal with people goes farther than having just the skill to do the job. 
7	I have two degrees, Classics and Computer Science. I was a bartender in college.  I ended up becoming a software engineer and love it.  I know ENFJs are not the most common type in my field but it is a good fit for me.  I am moving into management and this is working nicely as an ENFJ I can relate and empathize with my reports.  
2	I work in the luxury hotel industry in their Sales & Marketing team! I have the support of my hotel family, and I get to meet new people and Express my creative side as well!\n\nIt's the best! I live in New Orleans, so it helps that the industry is kinda booming down here.
2	I’m a speech language pathologist! I love the personal interaction and the ability to help people. I hate coworker politics and overbearing parents.\n\nHowever, the pros far outweigh the cons for me and I find it a wonderful fit for my personality type.
2	Financial planning. Real financial planning, not selling products. It's more than just numbers and retirement estimates. A really good planning firm does more than all that. It's like getting to hand hold people through their tough and joyous moments in life. 
2	I’m a social worker. I love helping others and seeing them succeed. It’s very rewarding and wonderful to work with others who care so much!
2	A web developer. \n\nI seriously need to consider a change of my occupation now. It's not fun lol.
1	Worked in a call center for 6 years, it really is brutal unless you have free reign to help and support people. Id much rather work with animals or in small personal teams where I can focus on a few people and help them <3 
1	Electrical Engineering 😁 I love engineering, and this degree works well because I end up engaging with my coworkers and expressing ideas pretty clearly. It also helps that I'm not scared of speaking in front of crowds, so when my team has to make presentations or speak in front of the company, I end up doing most of the talking and explaining. 
1	Wouldn't psychologist be a good career. Of course you'd have to get a Masters or better but it sounds quite suitable to the ENFJ type. Wouldn't most things that INFJs do for careers be similar to ENFJs? 
1	Landscape architecture major. Have had several jobs in the field. It's a pretty broad field and my favorite parts have been community development and helping less fortunate communities get green spaces and parks.
1	I'm a clinical pharmacist. I love my job and most of my patients
5	INTP Overthinking ENFJ, Again! XD	I should probably go to the INTPs with this one but I need Feelers more than Thinkers right now - and to just pour my ever-looping heart out XD!\n\nI think my ENFJ wants to escalate things to more than friends - slowly, sure, but he’s leaving a LOT of breadcrumbs for me to pick up. \n\nAt first I was warm and fuzzy about it all but now my insecurities and logic are settling in and working overtime. Rather than do my usual bulletpoint list of why I think he’s hinting he wants more than friendship - let’s go with the assumption that he does.\n\nI’m freaked out.\n\nI’m emotionally broken. I am not girlfriend material yet. I may never be but I will never be NORMAL girlfriend material anyway. He’s 7 years younger than me. We’re both essentially starving artists at this point. He’s still SO nervous around me (tho way less than he was) and never initiates, tho is ALWAYS up for anything with me. If we were beauty and the beast, I’d be the beast - and yet he tells me how attractive I am to him. He’s so talented in his field, I have zero talents outside of thinking too much XD\n\nBut when we’re together, he makes me smile in a way that no one ever has. His hugs feel like warm chocolate cake and when I make him laugh, everything that's negative and cynical evaporates inside of me in less than a heartbeat. His piercing sad eyes can climb straight into my soul and he never falls for my emotional blocks. He doesn’t even know they’re blocks! He just goes: “(That story) you just told me doesn’t sound like everything going on. What’s really upset you?” NOBODY DOES THAT! Nobody wants “more” from me - they actually want me to STOP talking, haha! \n\nMy birthday was the other day. I asked him to the movies and before I even got the whole question out he said, “YES! Absolutely!” I didn’t think it was a date but he posted on social media the next day: “Date someone whose eyes give you chills when they look at you.” He never posts personal stuff like that except when he posted a video “thank you” of the birthday gift I got him XD\n\nHe made me hug coupons as a gift and I nearly fell apart. He told me about a tattoo he wants to get that no one will ever see and only means something to him. It was so deep and profound that I wanted to take his face and make out right there XD I want to take all of the fears and pain he keeps inside and burn them in the fireplace.\n\nBut I can’t. \n\nI don’t think I’m what he needs. Plus, maybe I’m wrong and in his mind I’m just one of the many (much prettier) girls who have a crush on him. I don’t feel like I have a crush on him - I feel more like we’re becoming best buds - and I know he didn’t post about anybody else’s gift. Ug, maybe I’m wrong about everything, LOL!\n\nThanks for letting me get this off my chest! :D
4	He likes you haha. I know as an ENFJ guy, I would go the extra mile for the girl I like just like he does for you. I feel that whenever I like someone, it’s written all over my face but my actions will confirm that which is where all the little extra things like hug coupons and special posts come in. At the very least, he cares about you quite a bit. \n\nIt’s very typical of ENFJs to not take initiative because we want to know what the other person wants to do. Regardless of what it is, we’ll jump at the plans as it allows us to just spend quality time with that person. With that kind of excitement he’s been showing, it’s obvious he loves being around you.\n\nDon’t think you’re not good enough. I feel the same when with my crushes but I see it as a natural feeling in the attraction phase. You being yourself is enough. There’s nothing ENFJs love more than helping people come to terms with their own potential and seeing that makes us happier than ever. I appreciate your abilities to see the good in someone for the smallest of things they do and I’m sure that’s one of the many reasons he cares for you so much :)
2	Addendum: Do ENFJ males mean anything by using a heart emoji at the end of a convo about meeting up the next day?? Because that just happened O_O \n\nI hope someone sees this - I am WAY outta my (emotional) depths here! XD
2	Is it possible to feel like a ENFJ/INFP and a ESFP?	Good evening! 😄\n\nI have taken numerous amounts of tests, and recently I have taken a couple more, and almost always tested as ENFJ, but I took a ENFJ/ESFP test, got ESFP a couple of times, but got ENFJ a couple too. I mainly type as a ENFJ though, but I also heavily relate to a INFP. \nIt's so confusing Haha. I relate to all of these personalities, I've done cognitive functions tests and read about them, and the tests say I have high FE so ENFJ? \nAlso I would class myself as an Ambivert most days I'll be extremely extrovert and others I'll want peice and time alone...\nWould love to hear your thoughts! \n\nTake it easy x\n
4	I sometimes feel ENFP/INFP, but that’s my ADHD lol. I always get ENFJ as a result on cognitive functions tests. Always.
4	Hey,\n\nI also identify more as an ENFJ, but will often type as an ESFP on tests (glad to know I'm not the only one :D ). I took this as the tests being really dependent on how you feel at the time of taking it. Both types seem to be very people orientated, but one is more spontaneous while the other likes to take charge and get stuff done, so it's more just my outlook at the time and maybe how tired I am.\n\n(edit) Also do seem to identify with infp more than I thought I did looking back, so I guess I'm as clueless as you on this
3	I wouldn't focus to much on introvert/extrovert\-edness. With NFs, it's easy to feel like an introvert when your an extrovert. When you take the myer's briggs test it depends on your awareness of yourself. Don't forget that you are on a sliding scale. Which means, that no person is ever completely behaving the same way in all situations. It's like assuming that NT types are incapable of feeling, which is wrong. Identifying the type is not so much relational as it is what is occurring on the cognitive level. Many mbti types can find some similarities in how they behave or handle situations/people. That doesn't make them the same.\n\nI recommend taking the test again and check your awareness, following these **tips**:\n\nMakes sure to answer honestly, even if you don't like the answer.\n\nDon't answer comparing yourself to others.\n\nDon't focus on one or the same experiences or same environments \(work, school, friends, family, strangers,volunteering...\).\n\nDon't think of how others perceive you. It's how you experience yourself. People don't know your mind.\n\nDon't answer how you want to be or what you think to be the "right" answer.\n\nDon't think to hard. Answers are on a scale. The more definite answers you have, the likelihood you feel like the results fit you.\n\nAfter you get your results see where you are more borderline in the percentile scale. See what mbti types those are and read about functional stack for each of those types. The functional stack is what distinguishes each type even if the mbti letters are only different by one letter. Two great resources I like are: type in mind, and psychologyjunkie. Google them :\)
2	It's possible to feel like that if you don't have a strong grasp on typology.  Tests are not a reliable way to type yourself or others unfortunately.
6	How to deal with realism?	I find it a hard time to cross myself with realistic people. \n\nAs most of the world is pretty realistic, the realism means to kill off your dreams, fantasies and wonders till they make you understand you are not special, and the earth spins around and around.\n\nRealism in ways saves the day, they get things done.\n\nI just find myself really reluctant to accept or struggle to object the realism that crosses your mind.\n\nLike the workers in factory or in office, robotic manual work every day. How can they not stress out about the over-repeating game? \n\nI lose interest for those stuff at once if I get into them. \n\n\n
3	Yeah that’s the point, pick a target and move towards it using the best strategies you can drum up. You may well have to engage with all that realism to get to your destination, but at that point it’s a lot less depressing when you do because you know what it’s all for.
2	A lot of people I know that do the same ol thing day in and day out do feel the repetition and wish it could be changed. The thing is the reasons they’re working. Family, bills, their future. \nMy job as an accountant is certainly no job of passion. But the life I want, the people I want to support, the future I desire, just needs me to work.\n\nWasn’t born into luxury unfortunately lol
2	i feel like ENFJs are pretty realistic people.  Knowing what you need vs what you want.  Having a consistent schedule is actually less stressful than having things be different every day.  Sure it's repetitive, but having to deal with a ton of decisions every day is taxing.  Usually picking up hobbies and finding something you enjoy doing helps days go by.  IMO, it's ok to be idealistic, but if you don't allow yourself to be grounded, then you wouldn't get anything done.
1	In my experience, realists tend not to aim too high, it’s easier to sit on the fence and put people down for trying then to actually try something themselves. \n\nIn saying that, realism isn’t a bad thing but I think more often than not it’s paired tightly with close mindedness and pessimism, which definitely are. \n\n90% optimist, 10% realist is a better approach, meet your responsibilities but also set goals and work towards them. 
1	the world is an interesting and beautiful place. all of your fantasies are based off of what you- an earthling- can conceptualize, and those concepts are present in the world around you in some form or another.\n\n
16	Uncomfortable with being spoiled	Fellow ENFJs, I have a question for you. Does anyone else feel a little uncomfortable when a S.O. or someone else does nice things or buys nice things for you? I am just not used to that. My ENTJ s.o. is frustrated that I cannot tell him what I am comfortable with in terms of being "spoiled". I want to say "small gestures" but I have no idea how to explain it. It doesn't take much to make me happy. I don't need expensive objects or grand gestures.
14	I definitely feel similarly! I guess part of it is practicality (I know the things I want and will get them for myself) and the other is a need to assert independence (I am able to get this without relying on anyone). Small gestures that show someone is thinking of me are so sweet because it's not the monetary value of an item but rather the thought that went into it. For me, spending quality time with someone I care about is leaps and bounds more important than them buying something for me and having that be it. Time > Money! This could also be a love languages thing, if you're into that. Look it up :)
3	Oh absolutely I hate specifically asking for money from my husband. Like if he has the cash and I don't. I get very uncomfortable asking to grab a fiver. It was worse when we were dating but even when I was a stay at home mom for two years I hated asking my husband for money. \n
2	Not ENFJ myself, but I have an ENFJ friend who was pretty chill about it. Once even asked for 100 euros cash to buy this dog he really wanted. But he always pays it back pretty soon after.
2	No i love that! But I don't need it, I prefer just spending time with people. I think some people like the act of gift giving, though \- I think it's fine to receive.
2	Totally understand that feeling. Just feels out of place. It took me awhile to get used to it with my SO.
1	I hate freaking receiving gifts, it makes me uncomfortable as hell. I’m with ya.
6	Software engineer ENFJ	Anyone here an ENFJ and software engineer? I'm for sure the odd one out at work, but I've definitely grown to appreciate the fact that an overwhelmingly large majority of my peers are introverts, since being around introverts is easy. But, I do miss the more outgoing personalities and people who are more social. 
4	Yes and it is tough. Honestly, the more years I rack up in engineering, the more I feel suffocated by the lack of personality diversity. It's tough when you're the only extrovert in the team, and feel like you always have to take on that role because ppl expect it from you. Every. Day.
4	Yep. Can be tough. Been leaning into more consulting and solution development myself, just to have more interactions with humans :)  I wonder myself sometimes after a long day of just heads-down coding or something.   \n
3	Im an INFJ, and I too prefer design over coding.  I am currently a Systmes Analyst, but my degree is comp sci and I programmed for 10 years earlier in my career. I was good at it, but didn’t really like it. 
4	INFP M(22)	So I've never taken any notice of Myers Briggs tests till recently. I've definitely found that INFP is a definite match for me, I'm quirky, a good listener, a big thinker, introverted and a closed off unless you get to know me. I care about others and I love to help others even though I'm not the best at giving out affection. Apparently ENFJs and INFPs get along? I hope so. What are y'all about and how do you view INFPs? 
4	Love them. Just like you said, I see them as good listeners, quirky, and I’ve caught myself having very deep and exciting conversations with them
5	My best friend and current roommate is an INFP, and we work so well together. Quirky is an awesome word to describe her. As an ENFJ, I really love entertaining people and making people laugh, and I've noticed that INFPs love to be entertained. That being said, our conversations can be extremely rewarding. \n\nAnother thing that makes our  types so compatible  is that we both sensitive to each other's feelings, we both go to lengths to avoid arguing or getting into quips. \n\nFinally, I really love that she's introverted and I'm extroverted. I love going into her room after a long day at work and just catching up with her, because she usually has such profound little thoughts that she hasn't aired to anyone yet, and she's told me before that she really loves when I come in to catch up with her.
3	Can be pretty weird.\n\nBut the weirdness is mutual. 
2	I love infps. Contrary to what I've seen others mention, the two that I am close to are not quirky and are not shy. They are both so sweet and thoughtful. They make everyone feel at ease. I love their gentleness, understanding, and humility. I think its their greatest traits that stand out to me. As an enfj, I have not idea how they feel about me. haha
1	NF's tend to get along really well with each other because of the empathy and feeling factor.  ENFJs are really good at reading people and providing them support/affirmation.  Most of my friends are all of the NFs and a few STs and NTs.
1	A really good friend of mine was just typed as an ENFJ and we get along so well - better than 99% of the people I know.  (I am INFP)
35	Anyone else feel irrationally selfish when talking about themselves?	title, i really hate making any situation about myself specially if it feels like im whining or talking about personal issues, i would much rather listen to your problems instead!
16	Also im kind of paranoid about people disliking me but thats normal from what i read :/
13	Yeah anytime I do talk about myself, I feel arrogant and cocky. Also when I just acknowledge praise and try to move on, others will say I’m being modest and stuff but I just feel uncomfortable with praise, especially when it’s mentioned in a group setting
5	This is why writing a resume type thing is very difficult for me. Because I'm not very good at like "talking myself up." Like they want me to write about all the things I'm good at, and I just feel really uncomfortable doing that.
2	Yes, me too. I always feel guilty or like the other person doesn’t want to hear what I have to say. I always just assume I care more about other people than they do about me. Is that an ENFJ thing?
6	Unrequited love for ENFJ girl	I am an INFP 4w5, turbulent 25 years old loner. She is 20 yo assertive ENFJ. \n\nPracticaly I never start conversations with strangers. But she caught my eye so I made a move and talked to her. It was 7 months ago. I am a bit awkward but talking to her was amazing beyond my expectations. Turned out she had a boyfriend, so I didn't get her number. After 2 weeks she found my fb profile through my photography page and we started chatting. She was always starting conversations, asking how I feel etc. We began to share some deep personal things and those conversations meant the world to me. We hanged out from time to time and after 2 months since our first encounter she wrote to me that she had broke up with her boyfriend. A week after that, I opened up and told her how I feel about her, that she is special to me and I would like to be closer with her. She rejected me, told me that she is with that guy again, and she felt guilty and sorry for me. I took it hard. So I accepted that we are friends but distanced myself a bit and so did she. Couple of weeks after she found some new guy, I found out when they've announced their relationship on facebook. But that lasted like 7 weeks or some such and when she went single again, our contact once more became more frequent. But still \- just friends. Don't get me wrong \- she is an amazing friend, she doesn't put her problems on me, she constantly motivates me, makes me laugh, doesn't mind coming to my place and bringing some beers. She strongly likes me and I her, but... I have been alone all my life, never even had a kiss. Tried dating and it never worked out. I rejected \(couple of times\) and I have been rejected \(quite a lot\). She knows it. I'm not surprised that she \-being very attractive\- is not attracted to skinny, daydreaming loner like me. She's not perfect, but I've never met a girl that interesting, warm, funny and understanding, who would want to know me and my world. Every time I am around her I feel the need to hug her, touch her hand, I fantasize about kissing her. But she doesn't feel this way about me. I wonder if it is possible for her to percieve me romantically one day. I have heard that ENFJ's don't change their mind about people and I don't want to poison myself with foolish hopes. What are your thoughts ENFJ's?
6	You can do so much better. I promise. There are so many people out there in this world, and so many ENFJs, for that matter. I know how unreal and obnoxious that sounds, but I mean it truly. It’s something that’s also hard for me to hold, but everyone deserves real interest, not to have to work for someone who does not reciprocate. And I get the pull to think it’s about you, but as a 25 year old girl who has an exclusive thing for skinny daydreamers, you are somebody’s perfect type. \n\nI know it’s the last thing you want to hear, but the thing that helps the most in these situations is focusing on self-acceptance and love. 
3	I know how that feels my friend. I’m a 20 year old ENFJ guy who’s been hopelessly in love with an INFP girl in my college. We both became very close very quickly, comforted each other through the tears and struggles of our own lives, and were always there for each other. I feel like I’ve given her so many signals of liking her but long story short, I distanced myself from her because I felt she was using me and wasn’t reciprocating the sacrifice I’ve done for her. It’s not her fault or anything like that, it’s just how life goes and I’ve learned a lot from it.\n\nI still have feelings from her so only time will tell what will happen between us. Props to you for telling her how you feel because I still don’t have that courage. I can’t really offer much advice because I’m lost with girls haha. I’ve never been in a relationship or anything like it. Just know that time is the best healer. \n\nSometimes she’ll pop into your head and it’ll get your mood down. But know that there is a lot of life to live, a lot of people to meet, and a lot of experiences to engage in. If you need to, distance yourself a bit more. You know yourself and your emotions best.
3	First, I want to say, I'm happy you met this ENFJ friend who has been a dear friend to you. I commend you for also coming forward about your feelings towards her. It takes courage to do that, and I know its tough facing rejection and also risking a friendship after coming forward. I'm glad you both remained friends, there definitely is value there. Even if you have faced many rejections and you have not experienced intimacy and love with a woman, don't let that stop you from trying in the future. Also, don't let that make you desperate for anyone. You should care about the quality person you let in your life in a romantic way, especially for your firsts for everything. \n\nIt's possible for her to see you romantically, but I don't think you should put all your hopes in that. You should place greater value in yourself to do more for yourself and work on your life as you feel is necessary to live and become your best self. I've never heard of ENFJ's not changing their mind about people. I think anyone can change their mind regardless of personality type. \n\nIt's possible that you are not her type. It's possible you have qualities that she likes in a partner, but you may not meet other things she needs in a relationship. All of this is speculation though. Ultimately, you deserve to be with someone who wants to be with you, who can accept you, grow with you, and help you in weaknesses.\n\nYou're in your mid\-twenties and that is a good time to build financial security and develop yourself whether they be hobbies, careers, knowledge, life experiences, etc... Focus more on yourself, and you will find love on the way.
2	Oh my god I have been in your exact same situation, only we're older and the ENFJ is male and I'm an INFP female. The friendship went on for so long we ended up getting closer and closer as friends, only making it even more confusing and painful for me.\n\nI implore you, get over her now. Take a break from the friendship if you have to. Go no contact, come back later. My ENFJ has been understanding of my need to do that. Please do what you can to get over her. She won't change her mind. You deserve better. She seems like a good friend, but that doesn't mean she would be a good girlfriend to you or wants to. The longer you let this go on, the worse it will be for you, and the longer you're delaying finding the real relationship you deserve. There's nothing wrong with you -- you're someone's perfect dude.
16	(INFP?) Dear ENFJ in my life,	I would like to start off with an apology. I really hate that we don't get along better. I know we clash in a lot of ways and I wish it wasn't such an issue. I wish I could help you not feel hurt when I need alone/quiet time, and I wish I could express certain things to you without hurting your feelings. I know you're pretty understanding but I can tell it bothers you, and I'm sorry I can't seem to do anything to help. I know it seems like I get so exhausted and maybe even a little annoyed when we interact for very long- I don't know how you feel about this but I hope it doesn't hurt you too much. I can see how much you care about all of us and how you want to see us all happy and okay in this world, and I'm sorry I get so annoyed when you seem to smile so much. I'm pretty sure you're trying to make us feel better when we're all upset? And I know I must make it worse when I view that as annoying and fake, even if I never say it. You're seriously so sweet but sometimes I WISH you would be more honest with us all and show how you feel in that situation. I guess it's uncomfortable to show an unhappy face around other people.. I don't know why I can't seem to get around that and not be bothered by it, and I'm sorry about that. I'd also like to apologize for being such a brat sometimes; that's not something you should have to put up with and yet you do and you never call me out on it. I know the rest of us seem to be annoyed when you go on a little while talking, or when you smile wide in a stressful situation, or when you keep trying trying trying nonstop to help and offer solutions when we seem to just be stubborn and willingly upset. It seems like it really hurts for you to be in this family where people get upset rather than become appreciative. I hope that in my best days I do show my appreciation for everything you sacrifice and give to us. I really do love you so much and I see you trying. Maybe one day when I'm more grown up, I can understand you better, and I can be more patient as you are with me, the way you never scream or yell at us, never snap at us, never say nasty things to us. I hope I can learn from you, too. You came into a family of people with strong emotional independence (fi??) and I think I can see how out-of-place you seem to feel. Please know we all see your efforts. Please know we all appreciate how kind of a person you are and how selfless you are. Please also don't suffer so much in silence. I'd rather see you whine and moan than put on a happy face.. I hope that isn't too selfish; maybe for you it feels better just to smile. I know this letter was really really long and messy but I hope the message got across. \n\ntl;dr: I'm sorry everyone (including me) is so impatient with you for trying to happy and helpful; I can't imagine how frustrating that has to be. We do all see how hard you try and how warm of a heart you have, and even if it doesn't seem like it sometimes, we really love you!\nEdit: I think I'm an INFJ actually 
5	Some of my favorite people in this world are INFPs. Don’t apologize for anything. Idk what’s been going on in your life but you’re good. Not all INFPs and ENFJs are the same but it’s nice for you to take the time and communicate these feeling with those who need it
4	Thank you for writing this. Woah! It's pertinent to my life. I know for sure one my brothers who is younger is INFP, and I have a close friend who is INFP. Both are male, and I'm an ENFJ female. I love my INFP little brother. I really adore him. Even being older, I always feel like he helps me to be myself more and he is someone who I can learn from in areas I'm weaker in. He truly is sweet and I really hope he marries a good woman who will never take him for granted. My INFP guy friend I am still trying to figure out. He frequently ghosts me a lot. It does hurt like how you described. I always think I did something wrong. I hate it! I feel childish expressing that, but it makes me feel like I shouldn't be such a vulnerable person only to be rejected. It seems like he has only cared in the times I was there for him when his life was in a bad place.
1	Emotional Investments	We, as humans, are very bad at prognosticating how we'll feel, and we're constantly changing. It's very difficult to break this down into numbers. How should we make emotional investments?
3	Practice authenticity and radical honesty.  Slowly share more of yourself to people until you feel safe with them.  Spend time both observing and judging.  Learn stoicism.
1	I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n- [/r/enfp] [Emotional Investments](https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/8ktiz3/emotional_investments/)\n\n&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
1	I explained this to my ENFP bf not too long ago. I said it helps me to understand my feelings when I can externalize them and explain what happened, so I can look at the situation objectively. \n\nas for emotional investments, it takes time, for me anyway. for example, telling someone I love them only when I mean it. I tell my closest friends that I love them coz I really mean it, but it's a progression of our friendship that is the basis of that. there also needs to be a balance of reciprocation.\n\nI'd like to say that emotionally investing in someone takes time and effort. just be honest with them, hopefully they're also honest back, and try not to have high expectations. 
8	Do you think there is some influence or dynamic in ENFJ childhood that makes one feel more safe around people and need validation for comfort?	
3	I've always thought about this too. I'm a mama's boy, and looking back, I was fortunate to have one of my parents (mom) be extremely nurturing/supportive and in touch with her feelings. This definitely played a big role in who I am today.
2	I don't understand what this question is asking.  All children (and adults) need social relationships and emotional validation for comfort.

6	Super Empathetic and Highly Emotional, but a Non-Crier	Is anyone else like this? Despite being a deep feeler and being in tune with my emotions, I am notorious for **not** being a crier. The most that ever happens is that I get choked up, or have a lump in my throat. However, I only ever cry **when I'm fighting with loved ones** (guaranteed to happen 99% of the time)\n\n\nIt's funny. I would love to be an actor. But acting is difficult for me. I wear my heart on my sleeve, but can't quite access the vulnerability on cue?\n\n\nFunny enough, I saw Love, Simon for the second time a few days ago and bawled like a baby (again!). If you've seen it, you probably know which scenes I'm thinking of.  
3	Yup! I very rarely cry and only do so if I'm super angry or EXTREMELY upset. Oh, and when animals die in films. Otherwise, nada.
1	 I can never cry when I want to and need to get it out. It just stays bottled up. Then something random will trigger it and I’ll cry. If I think about how I’m crying though or letting it out, it’ll stop and go back to being bottled up 
1	A lot of my close friends have mentioned jokingly that they have never seen my cry and probably never will. I am reasonably emotional and empathetic but not expressive of my emotions very often! But yes, I too cry at films or in heated arguments, which thankfully don't happen often.
11	Lifestyle analysis for MBTI survey - 3 minutes to fill, will post results in a week. Participate too!!	
11	Too many passions to choose from	Do you ever feel like you have too many passions/hobbies, and only limited time to focus on one? How do/did you choose which one to actually pursue and which one to leave aside due to lack of time?
4	It always feels like I have a million things to do and a million things I want to do. Like the day is not long enough for everything. 
3	I know I identify as a multipotentialite (Google multipotentialite emilie wapnick and watch the ted talk), I imagine many other ENFJs do as well. Emilies website and forums have great posts about living life when you're constantly drawn to new passions.  
4	Absolutely. I have so many interests but I've never gained any significant mastery of any of them
2	Yes yes yes. I know that being overwhelmed from being interested in too much stuff is a very Ne thing, but still. I usually switch hobbies every other month and I find that it heavily depends on the people I’m hanging out with, my environment etc. \n\nFor example right now I’m really into streetwear and rap and I’m starting to learn how to skate, but last month was all about mbti and psychology, the months before that I was really into Dungeons and dragons, Wow, tarot reading, philosophy, the list goes on.\n\nI like dabbling in a bit of everything because it really helps me connect with a lot more people. I’m really confident in my ability to find common ground with just about anyone. It really sucks sometimes though especially when you struggle with being your own person and having a strong identity.\n\nHow do you deal with it OP ?\n
2	Yupp and I bet a lot us do. I've gone through countless cycles of finding a new hobby, starting it, and quitting it after just a couple weeks/months. For me, each short lived hobby costs time and sometimes money, so what I do is, I pick just one or two of my interests and fully pursue it, with the goal of mastering it.\n\nIt's so easy to do something just for fun and drop it when it requires a certain level of commitment, but if you stick with it and get over that hump, you'll reap all the benefits of what we call hard work and practice :) 
2	I don't give much time to my hobbies sadly because I'm focused on my career which is for the best. Whenever I do need downtime  I have to think of several factors. The hobbies I chose were things that didn't require me to be consistent or have already been incorporated into my life. \n\nFor example:\n1. Cooking something new once a week! Everyone cooks but make something you've never made before. I had chocolate pasta, jelly wine and vanilla ice cream for dessert recently!\n\n2. Hiking around your area and explore. I live in the Bay Area so there are plenty of options here.\n\n3. Discover new coffee shops. You know you like to talk to people 😉 Concerts or club events or dance class.\n\n4.  Short read book or tale for 30 minutes or go to an art class or just make any art.
1	See what becomes of them. Try 2 or 3 or whatever you have time for and if one doesn't work out you may substitute another passion or hobby. You don't have to pursue only one thing and why should you anyway? Just be patient and you'll find a good fit
1	People think focus is about saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are.\n\nSteve jobs quote, I read the other day which is kinda relevant 
5	ENFJ's: Who's your favorite character from lord of the rings?	Also, please note if you're referring to the book character or the movie character, since they differ somewhat :)
3	Sam, Gandalf, and I like Merry & Pippin. Generally, I like hobbits the most.\n\nEdit: I've seen the movies, haven't read the books.
3	Gandalf. The most selfless, wise, principled, humane, competent, and caring personality in the entire trilogy! 
2	Arwen, Aragorn, Gandalf, and Galadriel. I can't choose a favorite.
1	Sam, Pippin, Faramir, Eowin, Aragorn. I can't really narrow it down woops
1	Aragorn, Sam, Gandalf, Eowyn
1	Sam!
1	I always loved Legolas since I was a kid. Definitely him with Aragorn and Gandalf right behind
1	Gandalf for sure. He never takes glory for himself. His sole purpose is to inspire others to greatness. 
1	Aragorn!
115	Who can relate	
12	That's why every Enfj should have an Enfj in there life, so they can solve the each others problems. 
5	r/meirl sad yet true. Well kinda sad. I’m proud to help others and it makes me feel good
2	Lol that’s so true!
1	Lol 100&#37;.
1	Accurate.
1	yupyupyup.
1	I need another ENFJ friend!!
6	Sensitivity Towards Language and Anxiety?	In my experience, it seems to me that I understand language a bit differently than most people. I would differentiate between certain words by their tones and use specific ones in certain situations. \n\nFor example, if I'd criticize someone, if it's a small mistake, I'd pick those weak tone words but still would point out his or her problems. However, people would interpret this as simply I am criticizing them. There won't be a difference for either strong tone, or weak tone. It's strange to me.\n\nAlso, is anxiety or maybe trust issues or maybe paranoia a common trait for ENFJs? Because of the personality structure?\n\nEDIT: How rational are you guys ENFJs? I fee like my rationality level is 100% where it leads me to literally everything. My sympathetic part is like a side-gift I use it when necessary. 
12	Infp looking for an enfj friend.	I’m new to Reddit, 26 year old infp female simply looking for a female enfj friend in a similar age range. I find it difficult to truly open up, I don’t feel like I’ve ever had a friend I really clicked with but infp’s and enfj’s go together so I’m hoping to foster a deep friendship. 
6	I'm 24 and female. ENFJ but sometimes ENFP lol. Hmu if you want girl :) \nAlways happy to make new friends and I love introverts ☺️
4	I'm 22, open to a virtual pen-pal of sorts (I've never really done the internet friend thing before), only I'm not female, so I don't fit in that demographic, exactly. Either way, I hope you're successful in your search! Finding someone you click with is a rare and special and beautiful thing, and I wish you the best in finding that.
5	ENFJ here hope you find a friend close to you! My best friend is ENFP we live together with his INTP wife and his ISTP brother. Pretty fun household the majority of the time! 
3	Hi! I’m an ENFJ guy and I think INFPs are great. My best friend and a girl I’ve been seeing are both INFP who both have wonderful qualities. Feel free to message me!!
3	I'm a 26 year old enfj female feel free to message me if you want to chat and get to know each other :) I didn't know the types go together but I love those friendships that click instantly so I'd be down to give it a try. Good luck regardless I hope you find what you are looking for ♥️
2	Do you mind a 21 ENFJ male? I may tick your childhood stories in the first\nchat. **Maybe.*\n\nI made a guy open up about his drug dealing/addicting history in the first meeting, still wonder how the heck I did that...
2	Hi SundayTuna,\n\nThis is my first day on Reddit. Yayy! I'll be your friend. I'm 28 year old female, ENFJ. Feel free to add me as a contact and message me. I might be slower since I'm still figuring how to navigate. :\)
1	Hey I'm best friends with an entp
1	Hey! ENFJ, UK, 24 turning 25 in a month. I'd love for you to hit me up! This is my throwaway account but I can give you my usual one if you DM me :) 
15	relationship curiosity (eNFJ, Male/INTJ, Female)	So I'm not normally big on the MBTI stuff, but ever since my friend (the INTJ) begged me (ENFJ) to take the test, I've been reading up on a lot of stuff. As it seems, ENFJ males are very rare and INTJ females are super rare and everything I've read about our different types is pretty spot on. Of all the articles and things I've read, this pairing is normally reversed genders. \n\nSo our relationship: At the moment we're just really good friends with strong(ish) feelings for one other - but even she has joked that she's an emotionless void (typical INTJ?) and doesn't know how to work with relationships. Though we've discussed our relationship here and there, at our current stage, we're not actively trying to start a relationship due to quite a few factors. One being that we met online and probably won't be able to meet in person for at least another year (if we even decide to pursue anything). Our lifestyles are plenty different as well. \n\nI'm not seeking advice or anything as I'm well aware that we both are walking different paths and can only hope that those paths will converge - but if not, it's not meant to be. What I am wondering is if anyone has had experience with this rare pairing before. How did you/they react upon meeting? How did the friendship/relationship blossom? What were some of the attributes that were made apparent during the initial stages of the relationship? Do you just want to say hi? Hello! Thanks for reading.

2	Hi! I am an enfj female and my best friend is an intj female. \n\nWhen we first met, we were just acquaintances for a verrryyy long time (just over 3 years) and simply had some mutual friends, i.e. sat with the same group of people at lunch time. I never expected us to become very close and vice versa because we were so different and didn't quite see each others 'value' as such. When we started talking a bit more, she definitely had the whole 'I am a robot and don't get the concept of feelings' vibe that you speak of haha.\n\nI don't know how the time flew by but as we spent more time together I noticed that beneath the extremely quiet and somewhat disinterested-looking exterior was someone who I could actually relate to on so many levels. We have similar opinions and lives and eventually she opened up to me about her feelings. (yes, she DOES have some. :) ) We always confide in each other about our issues and contemplate existence together with our occasional but very long and meaningful conversations. (I don't see her as often anymore) She is the most dependable and trustworthy person I have in my life and even if we went weeks without talking, it's exactly the same when we do again. \n\nPeople are often surprised that we even know each other let alone that we are best friends as we are supposedly an unlikely pairing, from two very different friend circles at college. She's someone who is very difficult to get to know and I'm one of about 2 people she's actually let in. But it's very worth it and our friendship is special. The relationship works once you talk it out and understand the other person's needs, e.g. I try to not get too emotional and feelings-y around her, and she listens to me ramble incessantly because it makes me feel better. :)
2	I am an INTJ (f) and I'm seeing an ENFJ (m).  We're both geeky freelance artist types, and I think our similar professional struggles helped us make a connection.  I think he's fascinating: warm, energetic, smart, brave, silly, and very emotionally open.  I'm quite guarded with my heart, analytical... admittedly a bit cynical/skeptical.  I find people confusing, want to figure them out, figure out the possible problems, and what it would look like to make things work and how to get there.  I am a closet romantic and have so much love in my heart to give, but I have to know that it's okay for me to pour myself into someone, first, because I'll go full bore - I'm serious about love.  My ENFJ said that even on our first date I cut through the BS and seemed to see right through him, and that blew his mind.  He says that I can seem cold and disinterested sometimes, but he's fascinated by me, too.\n\nI do have my worries.  I was initially dating around when we met, but that tapered off as I grew more interested in him.  Then I found out he's been chatting online with lots of women.  He said it was because he didn't always feel as if I really wanted him, and as we hadn't talked about being exclusive, he was keeping his options open.  But I do want him.  I'm wondering if I will be enough for a charming, people-loving ENFJ always on the road.  He's like the hare and I'm the tortoise.  Will he stop chatting with these other women?  I value his privacy and don't want to pry, but it's just so easy to chat up people online...  Will he get exhausted by my intensity?  We joke and flirt quite a bit, and I (mostly) enjoy the way he stirs and opens me up, encouraging me to pursue my business/life interests - but underneath that, I'm still so serious about the potential love we might share.  I feel so stiff and formal when I'm in the grip of my feelings - which is even harder being a woman.  If he feels as if I'm not really interested and want him - even though I say I do - is he going to find someone else?  I've usually dated INxx types and he's such a strange exotic creature to me, lol, which is why I've been sifting through the ENFJ boards...\n\nWe'll see how it goes...
1	I haven't heard of a ton of ENFJ \(M\) and INTJ \(F\) pairings before! I did make [a thread ](https://www.reddit.com/r/enfj/comments/8f3jop/enfjintj_marriage/)a few weeks ago about my \(ENFJ\) and my fiance's \(INTJ\) upcoming marriage and it had a ton of great stuff! I know it isn't exactly what you asked for since the genders are reversed, but it'll likely cover some things for you, hopefully! Best of luck to you two!
6	For all my fellow ENFJs :D	
5	The Atlas of Emotion	
7	I'm BACK!	So some of you may have read my thread [Dang! I give up](https://www.reddit.com/r/enfj/comments/8d0feu/dang_i_give_up/). In the thread, I basically stated that I'm looking for an ENFJ girl as I think my partnership goals have become a bit clearer now that I've met and evaluated some people in my life.\n\nWell, I made a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/8fs5er/24m4f_canadaanywhere_i_know_how_you_must_feel/) on r4r a couple days later and got an astoundingly amazing response. I've heard about how guys usually don't get any responses but I was one of the rare few who got 4\-5 girls messaging me after that. Which brings me to the topic at hand:\n\nAN ENFJ GIRL LIKES ME!!\n\nSeriously, guys, I can't believe my luck. I didn't really know she was an ENFJ when I started talking to her a week ago. But I had some great vibes coming from her, the exact same ones I want to feel from my ideal life partner. Best part? She feels the same way. Including the can't\-believe\-its happening part. Which is kind of getting to her. And I'm worried. She thinks I'm too nice for her and is probably having some problems processing her emotions. She's quite young \(20\) and the most ambitious, generous, thoughtful, caring and charitable woman I've ever met in my life. So far, we've been talking to each\-other like crazy. BUT in a systematic way. We both have the J trait so we're taking it step\-by\-step. For the first two days, all we talked about were our long term goals, compatibilities, expectations, etc. When we felt satisfied, we moved on to lifestyle and values to check if we agree on that part. Next, we voice\-chatted with each\-other and checked if we liked each\-other's voice and demeanor. Then came the time to exchange pics and check if we found each\-other attractive. And let me say this\- she's the most beautiful person I've ever met, as in beautiful not just on the outside, but also from the inside. So we've been taking it methodically and one step at a time, however still managing to fall hard and fast for each\-other. Eventually, I made her take the test. I was 90&#37; sure she was an ExFJ from the moment we started talking, and after the test results were revealed, she turned out to be an ENFJ. Then she took another test, got the same result. The chemistry is there, VERY addictive and VERY strong. Right now, we're still exploring each\-other's minds and learning about our personalities more. But since we live on different continents altogether, it's a bit hard. Even harder for me when she starts to undergo an emotional turmoil that I'm not exactly familiar with. All I know is that she's feeling a bit insecure about all this. She has this thought where she thinks that nobody will ever love her. And I don't want her to feel that way, because so far, she checks every box on my checklist for a perfect partner. So to summarize\- I DON'T KNOW how to care for my ENFJ better. What is she feeling? How can I help her? Is there anything I can do at all? I want her to feel better. I don't want her to give up on this beautiful relationship we've built because she thinks it's all too good to be true. What would you guys advise? She is on Reddit too, so if you want to say something to her, please do, since I'll show her this thread too.\n\nThanks in advance, guys!

5	Pen Pals?	Hiya, I’m normally a lurker here, but does anybody wanna be pen pals? I am an 15 year old INTP male from Singapore, but recently I’ve really started to want to talk to random strangers. I dunno, it’s just so cool to hear life stories from people around the world, regardless of who you are, I feel everyone has something cool to share. Plus, I think ENFJs are really interesting people! Really wanna understand them. If you have something you want to share privately, not to someone you know but a random stranger, or you are bored and just wanna talk, please HMU! I am serious introvert tho, so at times I may get really awkward, and I’m mainly here to listen. If anybody is interested, pls PM me!
2	You can try over in r/penpals. If you tic community info they're a list of mor, similar subreddits. Good luck!

63	I fall in love too easily.	I hand over nice little pieces of my heart pretty quickly when I meet people.\nAnd I get those pieces broken and hurt. And I get them loved and kept safe.\nBut I wouldn't stop giving those pieces away even if I could.\nI just love people. We humans are brave and strong and intricate. And I love that. \n\nDo you fall in love with people easily? Like, you love people almost as soon as you meet them and you want to know them, and help them, and be there for them, and learn more about them, and hear stories about them?\n\nEdit: typo\n
31	Absolutely. I wear my heart on my sleeve. I think most of us extroverted feelers do. I can't hide how I'm feeling and you can easily tell just by looking at my face. Sometimes it freaks me out how easily people can read me haha. The key is to find someone who reciprocates your feelings.

13	Yes, it is 10000% the source of almost everything bad that has happened to me in my life relationship-wise. It's a shame. \n\nI had to kinda laugh to myself when I saw this post on my front page just now because of how true it is. \n\nDo you think ENFJs are susceptible to this personality trait?
3	Its pretty hard for me to fall in love maybe not for 1 person but I can't imagine even liking 2 people (I'm an INFP)
4	Yup to all of this. I get so wrapped up in new relationships too, then I end up forgetting what I want/need for myself and end up putting stuff on hold to focus on another person. It's basically a curse lol
5	But then how do you know who is special? Or is everyone special? 
4	Wow I related to EVERYTHING said so far! I too fall in love easily. With everyone and every thing. I do tend to feel that it’s both a blessing and a curse to feel everything so deeply. Currently in a relationship with an ENTJ and to me he is everything. To him, I’m not sure what I am to be honest 
3	Yes, me too! It's just so easy for me to find one thing I like about someone and then it turns into a love-snowball. \n\nHere's a good song for this: \nhttps://youtu.be/3zrSoHgAAWo\n
3	You sound like walking molly. Probably the only type I can easily fall for.
3	Yes I want to but every time I got fucked up by breaking my own heart.\n\nAnd then yeah I have trust issues.\n\nAnd I stopped believing in anybody anymore. 
3	I definitely relate to this. I always want to comfort and nurture other people and just love on them. I think that’s part of why I’m a hugger, although becoming an adult, I had to learn how to not hug everybody hahah \n\nBut yeah, it’s like the positive interactions that are generated when you love on another person, feed my soul...now idk if this is because I have a deficit and I need this positive feeling or if I just enjoy it in general. Thoughts? 
2	The struggle is real.
5	I am in love with an ENFJ who is finding herself	I am in love with an ENFJ who is finding herself. She just got out of a long relationship last year. She is not dating. She is going to school again and will decide where she will go from there. To top it off she lives in another country. We have talked everyday for the past 6 months but her heart is distant now with finding herself. The only hope I have in my heart is that she still promises to visit me.  \nAm I a fool? Maybe so. I am an INFP who doesn't know what he wants in life but knows what he wants in love and she is it. She is the sweetest person I have ever met and I am in love.  \nWhat am I to do but wait? I have tried dating but my heart is not into it.\nI am in love and lost at the same time.\nWhat say you ENFJs, what is this lonely INFP to do?
10	Unfortunately, timing is one of the more determining factors of relationships. You say you are in love with her, and if you really do, you’ll unconditionally support her through her endeavors, even if that means letting go and giving her space. She is in an independent process that requires her undivided attention. It’s difficult, and as an ENFJ, I can feel a bit claustrophobic in that I may not be getting the space I need. I know this probably isn’t what you want to hear, but hope things work out! ENFJs never forget the impact and connection you make :)
5	When I read this yesterday, I wanted to reply right away but was busy at time (I know, typical ENFJ). \n\nI’m an ENFJ female, and my boyfriend is an INFP male. We went through something very similar when we first got together.\n\nI was still trying to find myself. I didn’t know what I was doing or where I was going next.\n\nWhen we met, I thought he was a nice guy, but I also knew I didn’t want to get into anything. My life was too uncertain at the time and I couldn’t even begin thinking about a relationship. When he first started showing interest, I thought it must have just been infatuation. I thought that he must be in love with the idea of me and that he couldn’t really like me that much since we hardly know each other, and he has no idea how complex everything in my life was.\n\nBut for many months, he was there. He made a lot of effort in showing me how much he really cared and how unconditional he was. There was even a point where I tried to be intentionally mean to try to get him to lose interest since I thought that would be best for him.\n\nThen one day it just hit me. I realized that he’s the one for me and that I would never want to be with anyone else. There is no other certainty in my life except him, and since that day, we’ve been together ever since.\n\nI’m not trying to give you false hope because that’s not always how things work out. I think what I’m trying to say is that ENFJ’s who are still trying to find themselves may be in their most vulnerable and insecure state. Even if it’s not romantic, having a friend in an INFP (who is extremely loyal and caring) is really a blessing for an ENFJ at this time.\n\nI found love partially because of timing as well. I was uncertain for a long time and it was hard time for me. But for several months, the only certainty I found was in him and it gave me the comfort I needed. For an ENFJ, that comfort could be in a person ... or it could be in doing something. So she may choose what she needs to do over who she’s going to be with, and if that’s the case, I hope that is okay with you too.
2	Glad you're in love brother. But I suggest fix the physical distance first, meet up, chat and see if you two are cool together.\n\nBefore you pour your heart out, you might also want to see if she's in a healing state. If she's in a healing state, don't bother her, let her heal herself up or give her some personal advice. \n\nENFJs are cool, they are very sensitive to other people's emotional feelings, I think you can score with her.
9	What, to you, signals that a friendship is a close and special one?	Is it how frequently you talk to the other person? The type of things you do together? What marks some friendships out as special for you?
11	Do you feel like you need to talk to them? \n\nNot as a want and not necessarily because of romance. Do you feel this pulling at your gut that you need to talk to them? That's what it is between me and my best friend. It's not a matter of if I talk to them, it's when. 
3	When I can rely on them to be there for me, and they say the right things.

16	How does an ENFJ flirt?	I'm a Male ENFJ, and I have no idea how to get started into a relationship. I have no problems talking with other people regardless of their attractiveness, but I've never had the courage to take it past formalities or casual chatting.\n\nI was just wondering if any ENFJs could share their experiences with flirting and poke me in the right direction? I am terrified I will say the wrong thing and make things awkward or mess up a friendship, plus social reputation I've built up among friends, but at the same time I am getting to the point where I feel like I need someone closer to me than just the 'army' of friends I've amassed over the years
19	Compliment the person you're interested in, notice any differences (oh, you look different today, did you do something with your hair?). Noticing small changes will show you you pay attention and care about them. Just don't go TOO far or it becomes creepy!\n\nSmile! It'll make them smile too! Tell a joke and make them laugh. I personally find humour very attractive. It will also make them feel more comfortable in your presence if they don't know you well.\n\nGet to know them better. Ask about their interests, hobbies, favourite music etc. See if you have any common ground and go from there. Showing a genuine interest will also help build a closer relationship.\n\nBreak the touch barrier! A small brush of the hand, a hug, a playful punch, these are all great ways to send the message that you're interested. If they reciprocate your touch, this is a great sign. If they like you too, this will be sure to send electricity though their veins. Just wait and watch the sparks fly! \n\nGet *closer*. Sit near them, lean in while talking to them, stand nearer. This will indicate your interest in them. If they stay where they are or better yet, move closer to you this is a good sign that the feeling is mutual.\n\nKeep eye contact. This is key to building intimate and trusting relationships. Don't go overboard however, it's not a staring contest!\n\nConfidence is sexy, but bashfulness can be cute too. Decide which is easier for you and work from there. I personally become quite shy and coy when I really like someone. \n\nLastly, when you think the feeling is mutual, just ask them. Imagine what you could be missing out on if you stay silent. What's to lose? Even if it doesn't work out, you'll have gained knowledge and experience.\n\nGood luck! \n
19	I’m going to address just flirting in general. If you’re situation is more specific, let me know so I can help more.\n\nDo you have fun with your friends? Do you joke around and tease them?\n\nWe put flirting in its own special skill box as something we only do with “someone we are attracted to”. Drop that idea. Like right now... drop itttttt.\n\nFlirt with everyone. Tease everyone. Joke around with them. Make fun of something they do. Let them make fun of something you do. It’s a good time.\n\nYou’ll feel all good and warm. And that feeling just builds and builds the more you interact with people. Like a big ole rolling snowball of steamy love.\n\nThen, you find her.\n\nYou find the girl that eye-whispers, take me you giant steamy snowball of love. But, just keep focusing on building that goodness energy. She’s in your snowball now.\n\nWhen you talk to her, when you bring her into your snowball. You tease her just like you do with your friends. You listen to her and see who she is. You make her laugh. And there’s going to be moments where you think oh my god this little piece of my snowball is amazing. When you feel that, look into her eyes and be happy that you’re lucky enough to experience that, you hot steamy snowball of love you.\n\nAppreciate her in that interaction, let her appreciate you. Pause when you’re talking. And when I mean pause, don’t pause because pauses are sexy. Pause because you want to smell the roses on your beautiful meander through the garden.\n\nYou’re going to make mistakes. You’re going to say stupid things. And not everyone is going to like you. \n\nJust in case you didn’t get that.. NOT EVERYONE IS GOING TO LIKE YOU!\n\nBut you’re you man. \nYou’re great.
7	The best advice I've ever gotten by a charming friend whilst single was: 'be clear with your intentions'. You can flirt in a million ways, but when you are doing it be clear in your posture, your eye contact, and the ways you say things and relate to someone, that you are interested in them in a romantic, sensual way. It doesn't have to be very intense, just direct. Like saying, the door is open on my end to explore this further indirectly. This way, there is no pressure on one person or for goalposts. Rather, you can just start giving off vibes that you want to pursue more intimate relationships with people, and they can react how they want. Further down the line (or evening...) you can of course be increasingly direct, giving compliments and asking said person to come over to your place for another drink / to listen to some music. ;;)

2	I don't know pal, I am an ENFJ male too. To me, flirting is a natural ability. So I think it might be yours too.\n\nFirst, get comfortable with the person, then I guess the magic sources from yourself would just automatically shine.\n\nAlso bro, get alone. Get alone alone, like only you two and nobody else. This is very important as it distracts you away from your social anxiety.\n\nStart by trying to create two persons space. \n\nThen I don't know, start your show I guess.

11	The difficulty of Familial Relationships, Empathy, Self-Love, and Idealism	So lately, I've been thinking a lot about my family relationships. I'm Asian-American, which means cognitive dissonance between living my own life and filial piety (loyalty to family). A lot of difficult, trying stuff has happened in the past few months, and it's really been triggering for my depression. I have a friend who goes to NA who is always saying to "be at peace" and to not let the choices of others affect me. For the most part, humans can't change other humans. We are who we are. As ENFJs, I'm sure a lot of us understand this by now. But as I told them, it's not like I can just emotionally disconnect from everything. My empathy isn't an on/off switch that I can just flick off. I'm involved in family drama by proxy of being a member of the family.\n       On the other hand, I've been lamenting the prospects of my love life as a queer person as well. My siblings' relationships are readily accepted, whereas I'd have to fight way more to even get an ounce of acknowledgement, let alone acceptance (due to conservatism). I have another friend who always chastises that I "put the cart before the horse," since I haven't even started dating yet. But I have realized that I'm an idealist, perhaps because having something to yearn for is better than my daily reality. Ultimately, I care too much. I don't quite know if there's a way to stop or care less, but there it is. \n\n\nI don't know if any of what I wrote makes sense. It's difficult to articulate. It makes sense in my head though?\n\n\n  
6	So I want to see if I am getting takeaways from your post correctly. First, your reality is not ideally how it should be. You want to be yourself and want to live your life freely. You feel that your family is holding you back in some ways, you wish they can change, you want to dump them from your thoughts because the prospect of them changing their views seems slim. But you care for them and want their acceptance. You have two cultures and some identity turbulence. Your family has set expectations for your behavior and you’re constantly feeling on the wrong side of things and feel guilt. You haven’t yet realized yourself, you have not yet experienced deep passionate love for a partner. At this point you want to block out the negativity in your life. But you can’t do that because you want to or feel that you have to reconcile between yourself and your family. You feel like once they accept you, youll be able to live your life as you envision it. It’s either that, or you stop thinking about their wants and needs and focus on your own. 
6	You need to be around people that reflect the type of love you should give yourself. Don't stop looking. As you get older, it will also become easier to find It within yourself... however I found I couldn't do It around my families negativity, so I had to move out. We can be drained easily by negativity around us. That's not real living though! Maybe if we were an STJ lol, but we understand that idealism can become reality through action.\n\nJust remember that people change over time. You will get stronger, and your vision will become clearer as you explore. Your parents will also soften.\n\nCaring is a GREAT thing!! Never let the world shut that down. It's important to fight to maintain it! Caring hurts, but that hurt is important to acknowledge because it's informative. It also keeps your humanity.\n\nP.s - Your OP was beautifully written\n\n
37	Is anyone an ENFJ but a huge procrastinator and also really messy?	So I'm an ENFJ but I'm pretty darn messy and I also usually procrastinate on nearly everything! (Usually on school assignments or things I don't want to do- things I want to do or things that don't cause me much stress I will sometimes take care of ahead of time) I also hate doing laundry and usually by the time I do do my laundry I have a huge mountain of laundry to do. My room is also usually messy. \n\nHowever (bear with me here, this is hard to explain) as much as I can be scattered and messy, I always feel better and more comfortable when things are neat and have structure and organization. I often think to myself, "wow I wish I wrote things down in a planer or actually had a little more routine/organization in my life" yet, I still choose to procrastinate and be messy hehe...I'm so weird. I do have some kind of organizational qualities though, for example: I always log appointments, meetings, events, birthdays, etc. in my phone calendar and set reminders for them, and at a place where I was interning at and responsible for running group therapy sessions, I always felt more at ease and less anxious about running the group when I took the time to plan out exactly what I wanted to discuss in group before group began.   \n\nMy counselor and boyfriend  joke with me that maybe I am a "closet P" and maybe they are right to some extent lol...sometimes it feels like my J is battling with my more P like traits. Any thoughts? Can anyone relate?
22	I'm the exact same way. I think it's an underdeveloped ENFJ trait more than anything. I mean, like you said, you like being organized and all but it's just easier to procrastinate. We just need to get out of that habit 
11	Hahaha are you me? I am the exact same way, especially when I was younger. I NEED structure in my life even though it simultaneously feels like a hassle, and I also find that if I'm the one creating the structural system to go by instead of someone else putting it on me, I feel much better.
7	I have ADHD, my life is one big procrastination story and random item pile. 
5	i'm like this sometimes, but only because i prioritize my work (which i love so much) over mundane things like cooking or cleaning. i'm also very social so time with my boyfriend and friends come in second, then the mundane things. however, that being said, i still try to maintain having a clean house only because it's the easiest thing to do in my situation. 
3	I procrastinate for sure. A lose focus very easily and then just procrastinate haha. I am organized however 
3	Yes!  The weird thing is that I hold orderliness and cleanliness as sort of ideals, but am often too lazy to actually follow through, haha.  I love a clean room, but it usually doesn't bother me enough to actually clean.  I like getting school assignments done early, but I manage to get straight A's doing everything at the last second, so no reason to really change there, either.  I always end up procrastinating because I have difficulty finding motivation until I am under pressure.  It is really funny, though, that I seriously align with pretty much everything you described!  
2	I am an ENFJ and my room is messy mainly because I live with a hoarder and I'm trying to find common ground with this person so that I can toss everything or give these things away without conflict. I'm a very low maintenance man and I only need the simple things in life. I need a table, a closet, a computer and a bed. If I could I would throw everything away and have a clear mind and organized but it's not worth the argument or the conflict.\n\nSo think about that. \n\nIs your room not clean because you can have conflict with someone or something?
1	Being a XXXJ doesnt mean you have to be always clean or a neat freak. Same as how XXXP's arent always lazy and etc. This also goes with the other letters on the stacks. Its more on the cognitive functions and what youre doing is based on letter ditchotomy; it leads to alot of mistypings.
1	lol yuuuup!
140	When ENFJs are described as manipulative...	
21	Yep, the only way I'm manipulative is making believe people in themselves as much as I believe in them. :')
16	Fucking seriously!\n\nI've been told "You're too nice. You can't possibly believe in the things you say."\n\n... I mean, if you live such a cynical existence that you assume my genuine optimism about the world is either ill-intended manipulation or contempt-worthy ignorance, then I'm not sure I'll ever be able to convince you otherwise. \n\nIn other news, you need a hug. You don't know it, but you do.\n\nAnd in other other news, I'm not going to give you said hug. Because you're an unemptyable rain cloud on my motherfucking sun field. STOP RAINING. 
7	I mean its not \*your\* fault everyone falls in love with you... or is it? :p
2	Yes! So true!
2	Fuck yea
2	This post is speaking to me. Thank god that I found this subreddit
5	What have you mistyped as, if anything?	If you've ever typed as anything besides ENFJ \(based on a test, or you just thought you were this type\), what was it and why do you think that was? I'll start!\n\nESFJ \- I'm super down the middle with S vs. N, as I've heard a lot of us are. This is the most common one for me, although all things considered I think I use Ni more heavily than Si, so here I am :\)\n\nESFP \- this is what I got the first time I ever took an MBTI test freshman year of college. I think the P was totally related to just having no organizational skills at the time, and the S was because I hadn't really been in a situation where I was able to really dive into something I was interested in academically. Not hating on ESFPs, I just think that's how the results showed up for me.\n\nINFJ \- tested as this when I took the test on day I was in a super introspective mood.\n\nENTJ \- I'll test as this when I've taken tests that are set up in a way that reallyyyy don't do feelers any favors. Questions like "Would you rather people think of you as an intelligent, rational person, or a highly emotional person?" Umm...
2	I mistyped as INFJ for a while. While I did relate to it, this was during a period of my life when I was social anxious and shy. I now believe myself to be an extrovert. I did enjoy socialising when typed as an INFJ, I was just too scared to do it as often as I would have liked. Anxiety also lead to me feeling drained which meant I didn't feel up to socialising as much. \nUnder more stress during this time, I mistyped as INTJ, likely due to my 'shutting off' of emotions. I am now a lot happier with emotional expression, and understand it is only healthy and important.\n\nDuring periods of depression I type as ISTJ. I believe this is because I am more introverted due to the depression and type as a T because I become colder and lose my emotional capacity. I believe this can also be part of a phenomenon called 'blending' where N types, particularly NFs act as Sensors and to fit it better, as the majority of the population is S. I believe I have done his at times. My father being an ISTJ definitely made me feel pressure to behave in a way similar to him. Thankfully, now he had accepted our differences and embraces my differences as alternate options. \n\nOnce I addressed my issues, I became much happier and more confident and I now consistently type as an ENFJ. This types fits me very well. \nI suppose you might say I was an INFJ/ISTP for a period of my life, but I believe I was just a shy/depressed ENFJ. \nWhile I have not mistyped as any other MBTI types, I do relate to aspects of other types, namely the ENFP and ENTP. \nI sometimes consider whether I am indeed an ENFP, but the judging  is definitely my preferred function. 
2	I've been mistyped as ESFJ before too, depending on the questions of the test I guess, probably for the same reason as you. Nothing else though
1	Infp and right now the only thing I can determine for sure is that I’m an XXFJ
5	What INFP qualities are ENFJs so drawn to?	Question says it all
9	Their kindness and genuiness in all that they do, as well as their rigid moral code and strict adherence to their values and the things they are passionate about is extremely admirable. INFPs also have a certain amount of quirkiness to their demeanor that is just irresistible, I happen to be dating an INFP that also happens to be the love of my life :-)
4	Maybe it's because they are so similar to us in the way that they think. At least that's why I love INFP's so much. They understand me better than most and are very non judgemental, at least from my experience 
3	My best guy and girl friend are both INFP. But what most people have said, where there was a deeper level of understanding in perspective and values. To be honest, I've always been waaay more drawn to extraverted people, which sometimes I find odd haha
11	ENFJ appreciation.	Hi! I'm an infp and I just wanted to say that I really love ENFJs I mean, my best friend is an ENFJ and she is always so supportive and making sure I'm all right. We need more people like that around us! Hope I find an ENFJ as my SO in life later lol.
8	Wheeee my best friend is an INFP! I'm single ;) haha jk 
4	My best friend is an INFP and man, we get along so well it’s amazing. I hope you find an ENFJ for a SO too! Good luck!
4	My SO is an ENFJ & I am so so grateful for him. No one else allows me to be me like he does.\nEdit to add: I’m an INFP :)
4	Two of my best guy friends are INFPs yeeee :\) i am really grateful for them and they just understand me... I don't know why I still go for difficult people though. Maybe I should start looking for some INFPs. 
4	The girl I'm really into and my best friend are both INFPs! You all are beautiful souls
5	My best friend is an ENFJ as well. She's wholly awesome :\)
9	Pussy Foot Syndrome and Right Action (Se Action)	I suffer from pussy foot syndrome. In other words, if I try to do something like run into a cold shower, I’ll pump myself up and run towards it like William Wallace but then ease myself in there or run away like a pussy.\n\nHow does one take right action (Se action)? So far, I've gotten "Just 'be' by emptying your mind with no goal and being present-oriented.", but that seems contradicting and lacking in information. How can one do something without a goal in mind? How does one become present-oriented?
6	So let me paraphrase a wonderful speech from Fate Zero, between two messed up people, but even while these two people are very messed up there is wisdom in the exchange.  It is episode 13 2:50 in, I am try not to spoils things for there is so much dramatic irony.  But watch the first 13 episodes for the whole speech is much prettier with the full words and if you know the backstory.\n\n>Person 1: ***All things given form and substance will one day perish, break, and fade away*** /\n\n>Person 1: ***it is thus absoltuely essential that we must learn to find joy in the creation process itself*** (aka Se)\n\n>Person 1: ***and not just the final result*** (aka Fe and even more importantly Te)\n\n>Person 2: *So when something breaks we should make another?*\n\n>Person 1: ***Precisely!***\n\nThey then pivot and change the subject after Person 2 stops crying and have a dialogue that is quite silly about the nature of God / nature of the Universe.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut perhaps can I recommend you learn more about an INFP writer / philosopher Albert Camus.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQOfbObFOCw\n\nCamus is an INFP but through much reflection, introspection, and philosophizing he learned to be better in touch with his shadow (aka his hidden _NFJ and hidden _ _ SP sides) and incorporate more of those things in his life in order to live a fuller life.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPut another way, think of breath.  Breath is pain, it is effort, it is exhausting.  But we must breathe in and we must breathe out.\n\nWell meaning is the same way.  We must keep on breathing meaning into our reality and also taking meaning from reality (and finding the meaning from reality with our minds).\n\nThe world without humans just biological process like animals would still exist without humans.  But humans create, everything in this world is either man made, or biology.  So while it sucks to exert ourselves it is the only way to get the final product.  So we must take joy in creating the final product but we must also take joy during the initial creation process.  Aka we must find a balance between not just extrinsic motivation (motivation we get from outside forces, such as social recognition, money and so on) but also motivation from intrinsic forces (we find joy doing something for its own sake, aka we can enter the flow-psychology state, and so on.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat have you done recently that has caused a flow state?\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)\n\nCan we do more of that thing that triggered the flow state?  What in the past caused the flow state with you?  Is there a way to do tasks we want to do  but we can change them somewhat, we can nudge them just a little and suddenly those tasks can activate flow?\n\nNow there is more to life than flow, but we need flow in our lives and flow is one of the brain's natural antidepressants we we activate it having longer term effects besides the immediate effect of oh this is fun and motivating.\n\nSe, extroverted sensing should remind us of all this natural wonder in the world.
3	Courage only takes a second, and then the rest will follow
35	True ENFJ	Do you all crave being around people sometimes? Like I love being on the subway and I get to be around strangers and its so intoxicating! I wanna talk to all of them! But I don't wanna seem weird:/
38	I honestly have zero desire to talk to random strangers I see in public 99&#37; of the time, but I know exactly what you mean! I love being in big cities for this reason. It's hard to put into words, but I just love feeling like one of many in a huge, complex place. I also feel a lot happier and clear-headed when I'm working in a coffee shop or library or something vs. at home. Like, the sense of actively participating in the outside world is just extremely comforting to me, even if it doesn't involve directly interacting with anyone.
13	I can’t really relate to this at all. I love to go to work (I’m a waitress) because I love to talk to my coworkers but could care less about talking to the customers unless I know them. \n\nI’m on the phone or texting my friends all the time but don’t just let anyone in. I’d way rather go have dinner with 3 friends who I have great chemistry with than small talk at a party. \n\nDo you guys think this still sounds like an enfj? 
7	I love being around people. I lived with only my bf in an apartment and our schedule was all mixed up so he would sometimes come home when I'd already be long asleep. I was so depressed being all alone isolated living far away from everyone in LA. We got married and moved out into a house with roommates and it's the best thing ever. I love having room mates. We ha g out when my husband isn't home and make breakfast and dinner together. Being around people makes me feel safe and happy. Just being alone for too long makes me super sad and depressed.
7	Yes, even better is getting to connect with and/or help a stranger in some way, find a way to leave a positive impact on them. I am someone who likes to learn all sorts of different languages. In our household, Swedish, Icelandic, German, etc. were thrown around as easily as English. Germanic languages would be the ones I'm most fluent in, beyond that I'm sort of a Jack-of-all-trades, but for the past 25 years I've committed myself to spending at *least* an hour a day with improving. \n\nI'm pretty good with the Latin languages even if my Catalan needs improvement. However, my Balto-Slavic tongues even today are shaky when it comes to speaking with a native in a conversation that gets too complex. Indo-Aryan and Indo-Iranian languages are a bit below that in terms of fluency. My Semitic languages get real absurd sometimes, I'm fortunate to have had the foresight to get a good foundation in Biblical Hebrew beforehand. In both cases, if we're doing the discussion online I could be mistaken for a native. \n\nI have done this because I find languages interesting, but another motivation is meeting someone who speaks one of my target languages in public. When I was younger, before I married and had so many children, I did a lot of travelling and communicating with other people in their languages was blood in my veins. Even today I like to recognize someone's nationality and instantly connect with them by speaking their language,them speaking it to me back, me understanding what they said, and so on and so forth. 
5	Yeeep me tooo , i crave it after a week of relative isolation . 
3	Hm, yes when I am in a good mood I crave connection to anyone. If the person look approachable yes indeed I may start to talk to them! Of course it depends on the whole situation etc.\n\nIf I have a bad time, like sad moments, I also crave connection and had many times I did start talking to strangers or went outside to a shop/store to just have a conversation and felt better after. Just an hey can do much at least for me. \n\nHappens a lot before when I travel by train. I usually started to talk to people that sat beside me etc if they looked okay with that.\nMy social aneaxy kicked in sometimes and sure I was a bit awkward but it ended well after a while of talking. It's usually just the start that's the scariest.\n\nI did meet a lot of wonderful people and I don't regret any of them. It is very nice to just meet different people have a good conversation and then just go parted ways and still be very satisfied. Yes I love people.  \n\nI MAY BE WEIRD WHO KNOWS <3
2	I'm like the total opposite of what you said.
8	INTP frienship	Hey so I've had an intp friend for about 4 years now. We're in different places now but I know they're not busy right now...yet im still being ignored. \n\nI talked to them about it a month ago and was honest about how it hurt me and they apologized but I'm still being ignored! I just want to talk like we used to but they won't let me in... I don't want to stop being friends but it hurts so bad.\n\n\nDo you guys have experience with intps? 
5	Random drive-by INTP here, thought I'd weigh in even though I'm obviously late to the party.  I can only speak for myself, but I am simply not good at either talking about myself or staying in touch with people outside of social-media type contexts.\n\nIt's nothing to do with whether I want to or whether I like or care about them, it's just that talking about myself is tedious and painful and exhausting, and I simply can't do letters at all.  And then I eventually wind up in a feedback loop of guilt and shame and self-loathing at having gone so long without returning contact, not knowing what to say about it, knowing I have no excuses, and not having the energy to do anything about it, which just makes it worse.  There's a good chance this has nothing specifically to do with you at all.\n\nOn the other hand, I can go quite long periods of time without contact and pick up exactly where we left off last time, too.  And I appreciate being reached out to.  The best thing you might be able to do is communicate (whether or not it's true) *no hard feelings* about the lack of contact, and simply asking if you can get together.  Or, if there's a physical distance barrier, asking them *concretely answerable* questions about what's going on in their life (projects they're working on, anything interesting they've learned recently, that sort of thing).\n\nYour friend may feel as bad about the situation as you do, but lack effective coping tools and simply need you to initiate.  Sorry about that.  I'm well aware that I suck, so I have a lot of gratitude to my friends who put up with me anyway.  Good luck.
3	Maybe they are embarrassed now that you've made it clear their actions (or non-actions) hurt your feelings? Sometimes I avoid people who are upset with me until they chill out. I just don't do well with people stuck in their feels. \n\nIt might help if you act like nothing is wrong just to get communication going again. Then once they're warm, approach the topic without placing blame.
3	OH YES. My partner (also my best friend) is an INTP, and I’ve been dealing with moments of spaciness like this since meeting three years ago! I think it is largely in part to INTP’s being way more inclined to solitude (including the rich inner world in their head) - this is their own form of gathering energy. On the opposite end, us ENFJ’s gather most of our energy from other people in the outer world. So imagine in an instance where an ENFJ and INTP have each initiated their OWN forms of “recharging”, INTP in their solitude, ENFJ reaching out to interact.. those differences don’t exact match up, do they? I also have gathered most INTP’s are pretty aware of their emotions, but not exactly comfortable talking about or exercising them, as well as not too comfortable dealing with strong emotions from others. My INTP doesn’t like to be too emotionally probed or supportively coddled and likes to process difficult situations in his own introverted way. ENFJ’s are led by our dominant extroverted feeling function, making us very in-tune with general emotions and highly sensitive, volatile creatures at times, so I think our strong emotional nature can be a turn-off (or at the very least an energy-drainer) to an INTP, causing the gravitation of space at times. I’ve had lots of moments taking my bf’s space negatively, as if I did something wrong or he didn’t feel like talking to me, but it’s taken a while to realize 95% of the time it actually has nothing to do with me at all, and that that my hurt or upset is merely a reflection of how I feel about the space with MY high emotions and strong care. So really it just takes a great deal of patience, sometimes, as well as conscious effort in communication (absolutely key here!). Not sure if it’s a general INTP trait or just my partner’s, but he tends to be pretty say-just-what-he-thinks/feels-without-any-hidden-meanings, while I tend to subconsciously look for symbolism and connection in things (I think that tends to be more of an introverted intuition function (;  ) so it helps me to try to stop that thought process in its tracks and just take what he says for what it is. Patience and being non-judgmental for his solitude seem to be very meaningful things to him in our relationship. INTP’s are kind of an enigma, but also kind of my favorite human puzzle. \n\nAdditional side note: If your friend is willing, I absolutely recommend taking the “5 Love Languages” test - I truly believe this is a useful communication tool in ANY kind of personal relationship (romantic, friendship, familial). It gives you your preference between five ways of showing care for someone else, helping you recognize what you each most effectively respond to in your relationship so you can cater that form of communication/affirmation/care more successfully. One of my strongest responsive “languages” is “words of affirmation”, while this is one of my INTP’s lower ones. I can be very descriptively wordy (gee, never could guess from this novel of a comment, could you?!?) and also respond strongly to someone giving me verbal encouragement, while one of my INTP’s strong “languages” is “acts of service”. Once differentiating the differences, I realized wordy explanations or strings of affectionate phrasing’s weren’t really an efficient way to get through to him, while gestures of “service” got through his introverted exterior more successfully. \n\nhttp://www.5lovelanguages.com
2	Hi. I think i have kind of abandonded my one good ENFJ friend. We used to hang out pretty often when she lived in my country for her job but 3 or 4 years ago she moved to another country. And she tried to reach me with face book and apps such as whatssup? Many times. But I did not feel in the mood to respond those. I know she have had many friends all the time and thought probably she made new ones there and I can't meet her anymore anyway and dont know what to talk on mobile phone chatting. Tbh Iv sank into myself for some years lately and haven't had contacts with anyone. It feels bad that I didn't do my best to show my appreciation to her for being such a good friend. But it wasn't her fault. I Didn't think I could ever do a thing to make it better between us. I simply gave up on any relationships. Your thread kind of reminded me about her so I write down though hopefully no one sees this.

28	Always being the Instigator or Conversation Starter	Long time lurker here. Seems like a great group! Was wondering if any other ENFJs struggle with always being the instigator, whether it be with making plans or topics of conversation?\n\n\nI was having dinner with my friend and her partner last night, after traveling for two weeks. I asked them about a trip they took, and was waiting for them to reciprocate, but neither of them did. Recently, I've been realizing that I find myself always doing the talking and inquiring, instead of the other party doing it. Is this normal?\n\n\n**EDIT:** I have found my people! HUZZAH! I think I'm gonna like it hereeee :D *group hug*
14	Oh my god I relate to this SO MUCH! \n\nI am always the one to make plans, organise outings, events, dinners, dates, holidays, everything. When it comes to doing things, I've made my peace with it, yes it's annoying always being the one doing the inviting and can feel a bit sad and lonely when you can't remember the last time someone invited YOU to something, but I found that when I stopped inviting people and making plans, it just ended up with me having a terrible social life. So now I just suck it up and do it. I have a fantastic social life and my friends love hanging out with me and doing stuff together.\n\nHowever when it comes to conversation, this is something I really struggle with. I am always the one making conversation, asking questions, making a concerted effort to get to know the other person or just keep the conversation afloat. When the other person takes no interest in asking me anything or even asking the easy "what about you?" in response to my initial well formed question, it REALLY BUGS ME! Sometimes I'll just stop asking anything mid hang out and wait until they start making conversation, or asking me something, but usually this only happens after a period of slightly awkward silence. But it usually gives them the kick up the butt they need to start pulling their weight in the conversation. As an alternative to this, I've also just started talking about myself with out any instigation from the other person a little more, things like "So you'll never guess what I did over spring break" or instead of asking how their weekend was and waiting for them to ask me about mine, I'll say "I had a really lovely chilled weekend with some girl friends and saw that new exhibition at the tate as well, what did you get up to?" which yes it is a little uncomfortable and feels really arrogant and selfish and up myself, but if they're really your friend, they'll listen, they'll inquire, and they'll make conversation.\n\nHopefully that helps, but no, you're not alone!
12	I can 100% relate to this. I used to get so angry at my friends because I was always the one who initiated stuff. It made my depression worse too, because I would be thinking like "How do I know if they even want to hang out? Like do they just hang out with me because I'm essentially forcing them to? They never ask me to hang out with them." But like archisnap said, at some point you just have to realize other people aren't like us.\n\nSomething that helps me is surrounding myself with other people like me. For example, I am now working on getting my Bachelor's degree in Social Work. And so I now have a few friends that are enough like me to where I will ask them how their day was, I will listen until they are done, and they will usually ask me "well how about your day? How are things going for you?"\nAnd coming from my social work knowledge, I know that it is important to have that kind of support group from people like you. You need someone close to you that will ask you how you are doing and how your day is. I have had trouble with this because my boyfriend is literally the complete opposite from me (he is ISTP) so I just have to really rely on my fellow ENFJ friends to help me through my issues. 
5	Omg if this aint my life,  I always think that everyone finds me annoying because they never initiate..  
1	Yes\nI totally relate and also love this place, we are the enfj's
15	ENFJ/INTJ Marriage!	Hey guys!\nBeen a lurker of this sub for a while and wanted to post finally! I've recently become engaged and will be married in November. My fiance is an INTJ and my best friend. We've been together for 3 years and it actually took me a while for us to figure out he is an INTJ. \n\nI was writing to ask about anyone's experiences with ENFJ/INTJ relationships! Not that I'm reconsidering at all-- just wanted to know what things were great and if there were things that were hard to get though.\n\nA little background on us. I think these are some of our strengths and weaknesses.\n\nStrengths:\n1. we make each other laugh ALL the time (not sure this is MBTI related)\n2. we balance each other. I'm the dreamer who opens his mind and pushes him to believe in himself more-- he's my realist who keeps me grounded and helps me navigate icky unfortunate real world things. \n3. though he's an I and I'm an E, our time just the two of us recharges both of us so well. Of course I'll want to do a little more on a weekend than just watch movies and play games and he does occasionally need his gamer or reading time where we're not talking, but ultimately our quality time does not impede on any recharging\n4. Our conversations are always incredibly respectful, thoughtful, and deep. We love talking politics (an area we definitely disagree on but are always understanding) and interesting facts and theories.\n\nOur weaknesses:\n1. arguments. When we fight I just want to talk and talk and talk and talk about it. He often needs to give it some space (usually sleep on it) and then can address it with a calm and cool perspective. I go crazy if he tries to leave the situation unaddressed. We're both getting better at this since we realized this was an issue early on.\n2. F vs. T. Obviously sometimes I am baffled when his T is showing very strongly and it comes across as being unemphatic. One particular thing is if some close friends of mine do something stupid (date a crummy guy, some crazy bar story, etc) he'll say some off the cuff thing that upsets me. He loves my friends and I know it doesn't come from a place of hate, but something like that.\n\nJust wondering what to look forward to in our upcoming marriage! Sorry if this got too specific haha.\nedit: formatting
7	I think it's a good pairing. Your heart is safe with an intj.
7	Congratulations! It truly sounds like you both have developed a relationship of respect and trust. \n\nIt's interesting to me because my 3 year ENFJ/INTP relationship sounds so similar.  Perhaps because the types INTP and INTJ share a lot in common! \n\nSince the foundation of a loving relationship is well intact, the only experience I could offer is to try and encourage patience between the both of you. I've found with my INTP boyfriend, if I try to remain calm and make the conversation feel normal when talking about something that could have been an argument, he's more likely to share and address the problem instead of getting overwhelmed by my F. \n\nAs far as his T goes, I just always try to bring my slice of F to the table and he even has said over time that it has strengthed his Feeling capability. \n\nI would also maybe ask him what he feels the relationships strengths and weaknesses are because staying in tune and on the same page is key! \n\nSorry if this wasn't exactly what you were looking for! But thank you for a good post😊
7	5 year INTP/ENFJ relationship.\n\nWe're really comfortable with each other. We don't judge each other or anyone else so it's easy to be ourselves. We can say anything and not be worried that the other person will think less of us.\n\nShe gives me more of a schedule to work with. A lot of the time it's annoying but sometimes it's ultimately helpful.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what I do for her but I think I provide her with possibilities that she hasn't considered. She has said that I teach her lots of things.\n\nShe provides some much needed emotional support. I can find myself in the middle of an overwhelming emotional maze and she's always there for when it gets the worst. \n\nI guess I keep her more grounded. She has said I keep her more realistic but I think she does a fair job of that herself most times. She is plenty capable of seeing the bad outcomes and not just the good ones. \n\nFor problems? I don't like giving her specifics. Everything is a maybe for me. I don't plan anything so we clash a bit there. \n\nShe wants to vent and I want to solve. That can be rough. I think we've sort of come to a conclusion about that but it used to suck.\n\nShe's a sarcastic and open minded nerd. Not much else I could ask for. 
7	I find that I get along best with INTJ’s. It’s a good combo. 
5	Are you me and my fiancé? That honestly sounds just like us, both the strengths and weaknesses! I’m an ENFJ and he is an INTJ. \n\nWe balance each other out very well in the end. It’s been hard to find that balance since my fiancé and I are opposites in many ways, but I feel like it’s complementary most of the time.\n\nThe argument part that you mentioned sounds like us as well. I like to talk about things and thoroughly get through them, but he thinks I’m a broken record and it irritates him even more. He’s very logical, but I’m emotional. \n\nWe’re actually getting married a month from today (!!!!) and I’m excited. \n\nWe’ve been together for almost four years now, and while we have our bumps, things are usually peachy. As far as I can tell, it seems like you two have the kinks worked out. I wish you both luck! :)
4	12 years with my intj husband. \n\nThis all sounds really familiar. Something that we balance each other on is that he thinks dreaming something in his head is the same as doing. For example he designed our backyard shed in his head for YEARS, always talking about what it was going to look like, reading carpentry books, sketching the dimensions... until finally I was the one who was like “get in the freaking car- we’re going to Home Depot and starting this today” \nOn the flip side of balancing, I probably would have ran out that first day and bought some stuff and tried to slap something together- where his shed is far superior to anything I would have had the attention for. \n\n\nI recommend listening to the personality hacker podcast on INTJs, it helped me to understand mine in a whole new way.  \n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/personality-hacker-podcast/id793330058?mt=2&i=1000355250350\n\nAnd congrats on the engagement! Someone said above your heart is safe with an intj and for me that couldn’t be more true ❤️
3	I've given a lot of myself today already  (#ENFJlife) but after almost 7 years with my INTP husband, lemme say that there might be some "pet arguments" and differences you never get over.\n\nBut that's okay. It doesn't mean your relationship is broken, or you're broken, or he is. It's how you come back from your fights that matters. \n\nStill, NT and NF isn't easy. I'm honestly not sure I'd recommend it if it weren't already my life. Good luck! 
3	Congratulations on your engagement! Your relationship strengths/weaknesses sound similar to mine, although we are currently in the fairly early stages (just > 1 year). I am an ENFJ and he is an ENTJ and we struggle a LOT with the same weaknesses. Managing conflict and our different approaches to this is difficult at times and I struggle with the feeling that he is quite blunt. Any tips to overcoming this together?
2	This sounds extremely similar to the dynamic in my ENFJ/ISTP relationship! We are also engaged and have been together about 6 years. We both love how much we balance each other out, and I especially relate to what you said about time together recharging you both. We are also both very middle\-of\-the\-road on S/N and have a very similar perspective on the world.
3	Last Post Here; Aspergers and ENFJs	Would you date an aspie? I'm curious how ENFJs generally perceive, feel, and react to that behavior and if they're generally willing to date one. Aspergers is a lot like the INTP personality type.\n\nPersonally, I don't see myself willing to date a person with certain disorders, syndromes, etc. I don't think it'd work out.
4	I'm an enfj who's casually seeing an istp who's definitely on the spectrum. To be honest I like him quite a bit but I also am aware of how he and I are very different. I've consciously been checking my actions and reactions with him. It takes some effort to date someone who's atypical but it's not devastating. In fact, I find our opposition exciting. I get to explore the caviates of an atypical istp personality up close and in an intimate manner.
4	So I have dated one boy with Asperger's. That relationship lasted for about 11 months, but for about 80% of the relationship I really wanted out. We were both 18, and I was just graduating high school when we started dating. I really valued his friendship because he came across incredibly honestly and he texted me regularly, and was really well written in his text messages. \n\nA few problems with our relationship (specifically centering on our personality types) had to do with him having manipulative tendencies and me having a little bit of a saviours complex. He was at a point in his life where he hated himself and what was happening in his life, and was hurting himself physically. When we started dating, he wouldn't hurt himself if I told him not to... But it took three hours of sitting on my phone texting him and reassuring him that beating himself with a wrench wasn't going to help anything in his life. We'd have an ordeal nearly once a week, where I was sitting on my phone texting him during classes or I was driving frantically to his house to make sure he hadn't done anything reckless. I didn't end it because of this question: "who will help him if you leave? When you leave, and see him with a broken jaw or a fractured cheekbone, can you really continue walking around like that isn't your fault?" \n\nAnother issue is that I love (little bits of) attention. I think all ENFJs love little bits of attention, but with never ask for it. He wasn't very perceptive of my feelings, and when things happened or he said things that hurt my feelings, he didn't seem to notice or care. This really made me feel unsatisfied in our relationship, because I was really in tune with his needs but he didn't pick up on mine. \n\nThat relationship wasn't healthy, and I got out of it feeling awful (mostly upset at myself for letting it continue), but I don't think that that is the experience every enfj has dating an aspie. One of my closest friends is a guy with Asperger's, but he's such a happy-go-lucky dude that I love spending time with him (however he's also aware that he has aspergers, and he let's people correct him when he does or says insensitive things). 
2	(I'm INFJ) I've sort of briefly dated someone who's Aspie. He told me at the very beginning and I didn't really know what it meant. It was a bad 'relationship' because we were both really lost and depressed in our lives. Many years later, after I've read some articles about (female) autism and realized that sometimes my INFJness could seem like autism for those who don't know me, our relationship completely changed. I understand him now better than ever. He is a poet, he is a very sensitive person, I think he's an INTJ. I would never consider a romantic relationship with him again, but I like having him in my life as a friend. 
1	no black and white. some people have a ton of value that counterbalances everything. of course it depends on your needs also.  \nif what u want is regular sensory functional life, traveling , babies and food. probably not  
1	Ummm. I'm an ENFJ with aspergers. So no, aspergers is not like a special type, since we can also be typed different, as the rest of the world. Quite offended. \n\nPeople would usually never guess I have it if I don't tell them. And the things people do notice, are no bad things generally. Loyalty, honesty, being able to think outside the box, not doing bad things because of peer pressure, really bad things huh? \n\nIn the future I think aspergers will be seen more of a personalty type. It wouldn't be a "handicap" if the world was more flexible and there were more of us. It's not a disease like bipolar for example so I think it's quite unfair to just put us in the same bunch as people with mental diseases. \n\nIf you met one person with aspergers, you met ONE, it doesn't really say anything about the rest of us. Thanks. 
13	This is a song made for enneagram type two. It's the type that most ENFJs get so I think most of you should relate :)	
3	Beautiful song :) <3\nThanks for sharing it!\n
2	I started crying after the first verse. I'm both an ENFJ and a type 2.\nThank you thank you for this. \n \n \n\n\n \n 
7	Please help me figure how this works!	
5	Hello, it looks to me like you’re very balanced. Perhaps the test you took (which I happen to prefer over the others) was rather vague and few questions sparked your interest or made much sense to you. Not to compare your results to mine, but I hovered around 50% just like you. However, my extroverted feeling and introverted intuition hovered around 25 points higher than the others, indicating that I scored ENFJ on the functions test. \nTechnically, you also scored ENFJ, but there’s only a slight preference. Judging by you’re Ne Ti and Te scores, I believe that this is an accurate typing for you. You may also be an INFJ ESFJ or ISFJ but my best guess is ENFJ\n\nLemme know if you have any other questions :D
2	Hah, I took one as an INFP and I think Ti was my second-highest when it is supposed to be my absolute weakest shadow function... I'm not sure how exactly the function tests work but obviously they are not well-designed ;) Assuming you're ENFJ at least the dominant function was correct...?
1	What test is this? It looks fun
3	External Validation; Understanding; Immature Parents;	I'm an INTP who has grown up with emotionally immature parents, experienced childhood trauma, and who has received external validation and genuine emotional and personal understanding very few times in life, never from my parents, the latter never having been fully achieved.\n\nI want these things. It's why I do SO many things. It's probably why my anima usually manifests as an ISTP, ESTP, INFJ, or ENFJ.\n\nI live life like a to-do list, never focusing on the experience. This is difficult for me as an INTP.\n\nI've been told this may mean I'm harvesting self-hate, but I don't see any. I feel like a child raising their hands, craving their parent's attention, but I don't receive it, so I try to look for it via other sources.\n\nWhat should I do?
3	The only thing I can think of to help you at the moment would be to seek out a councillor, I completely sympathize with where you are coming from because I too feel like my parents are immature especially my mum. Luckily I don't live with her, but I do my dad and we clash on almost everything. But now I am a mum myself I do not want my child to experience the same cycle. \nIts hard to know parents can be like this, but the best way to deal with it emotionally is councilling. (I have councilling myself) It can show you things you may not know about yourself. There are so many positives to councilling. \nAnother thing I just thought of... is just to wake up first thing in the morning; make your bed, and write a list about all the good things you like about your self, even if you can t think of anything to write. Just wait it will come to you. Even be it that you like your own handwriting. At the moment try to focus on the positives so that when you feel like you are ready to pick yourself up and away from needing validation from your mum and Dad, you can be strong enough to deal with these types of obsticals. \nI seriously hope this helps you. \nThings will get better :-) honestly! Xox
2	from an ISFJ- How does one develop FE?	The ISFJ and ESFJ threads do not have as much hustle and bustle, so I figure I'd reach out to the masters of extraverted feeling themselves!\n\nI struggled most of my life to make friends. And on top of that, I really crave social connectivity probably as a result of aux-Fe. Even when I attempt to 'get myself out there' and engage with people, I struggle reading their emotions, trying to go-with-the-flow of the conversation, trying to give them what they truly want. I am not sure what you can suggest for me here as this is your dominant way of life, but any sort of insight would be terrific!
4	Have you read the book How to Win Friends and Influence People? It’s a classic by Dale Carnegie. You can probably get it at your local library or cheap on Amazon. It might sound like it teaches manipulation, but it really focuses on social norms and might help you. 
6	What does it mean to "get out of your way" for an ENFJ	I noticed that ENFJ said that when they like someone they get out of their way, but could you share some examples of these. Thanks!
7	19F ENFJ here! we just love doing extra things for people because secretly we want to be treated that way as well. Even though ENFJs want to love and be loved unconditionally, the expectations they have for the people closest to them aren't unconditional at all aha... \n\nBut as an ENFJ I've done cheesy things like thinking about my friends when I am shopping and just ended up getting stuff for them rather than for myself. Like this one time I saw candies that my friend talked about 2 months prior and decided to buy it for her and leave it on her desk with a cute note. And when my friend was feeling sick I decided to wake up early so I can go to the pharmacy to get her some pills to give it to her in lecture. Also just constant checking in on them to see how they are doing. If I don't care/like someone, it's rare that I do special things like that. But like u/eyes_on_the_sky said, when it's someone I really really like and I am afraid that they are not reciprocating then I back off completely. I'll have a really messy heart but I am very good at acting nonchalant. I'll be always thinking about them and wishing that they'd go an extra mile for me just so I know that the lights are green and I can proceed to give them all my love. 
12	Coming from an ENFP but my ENFJ friend agrees:\n\nBasically means always wanting to be there for them and showering them with affection and really put in a lot of EFFORT. It's fun for us to do, like with an ex of mine I went out of my way too. Like I'd do my internship every day from 9 to 5pm and right after, when I was dead tired, I still hopped on my bike, did groceries and cycled to his place. But at that time, he had no job, no school or nothing. So you'd think he would come to me or buy groceries beforehand since he knows I'm tired. But he didn't care that much it seems so I just put in extra effort to be with him and have a good time. And I gladly did it.\nSo even if a guy barely does any effort, I will always do whatever I can for them no matter how much effort it is. Actions speak waaaay louder than words towards others because we want to show them how much we love someone or care about them.
5	INFP here. Because of a, um, relevant personal situation, I recently watched these two videos on YouTube which I found super helpful for understanding ENFJs and crushes (or even just like deep friendships):\n\n\n\n1) [When an ENFJ likes you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkR5dHwYkhI&t=): TL;DW = they show it like crazy and want to be with you all the time\n\n\n\n2) [When an ENFJ "loves" you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_OREbDORgM&t=): TL;DW = They run the hell away. They hide themselves, maybe even physically, and become distant because all of a sudden they are experiencing internal Fi-like feelings and get freaked out. \n\n\n\nCan verify both are true IRL from personal observation... 
11	Been ENFJ entire life but sometimes feel like eNFP	I've always been believed to be an ENFJ since I was 14 (now 23), but more recently, I've gotten a couple ENFP results (mixed with ENFJ). I relate strongly with both, but I have no idea if I'm truly an ENFJ or ENFP or if there is a middle ground between the too. Anyone like this too or know how to truly differentiate?\n\n*Sorry I posted this one both enfj and enfp
11	There is absolutely no middle ground.  \nOn a cognitive function level, they are opposites.  \n    \nIntroverted Feeling (Fi)  \nInternal valuing has a rock hard set of principles it follows that are specific to the person following them. People with Introverted feeling tend to have a strong moral compass, and while they are capable of mistakes, tend not to bend what they believe in a general rule. It is less difficult for them to know the difference between what they believe to be right and wrong. It is possible for outside influences and life experiences to change what those values are, but it takes a lot. Note: This is just a STYLE of thought. It doesn't actually determine what those values are. Someone's values could be that they are a racist, for example. It could also be that they love all people indiscriminately.  \nExtraverted Feeling (Fe)  \nExternal values are a lot, lot more flexible. People who use external values often find that they tend to bend to the requirements of their outside circumstances and the people around them. Despite this, they are not inherently morally deviate. It's just that the standard for what is morally correct changes depending on what's going on around them. Another word for this kind of valuation is, "Empathy." Someone with Fe is likely to prioritize the people around them over how they feel internally. Group wellbeing is very important. Most importantly for this discussion, a heavy Fe user can chameleon to the needs of those around them without even realizing they are doing it.   \n   \nWhich of these two sounds more like you?  Obviously you do both, but which do you identify more with?  Which one wins out if they conflict?
2	They are the same real-world personality type, so ENFP can become ENFJ and vice-versa.
4	Friendships between ENFP and ENFJ	Hello! I was just wondering how you guys experience friendships with ENFP's. I'm an ENFP myself and I have this great friend who is ENFJ and while I have other great friends who I adore, he really seems to get me in ways most others don't. We have the same views and opinions about things that are really important to me and it's so refreshing to have someone who really gets you.\n\nIs it common that these 2 types get along? Just curious to your experiences with it. :')
4	I misread this as a post in /ENFP, but I'll keep my comment up because it's an answer and currently you have none. :) \n\nIf we're talking cognitive functions (and you're both accurately typed) according to that system, ENFP and ENFJ should get along sort of on the surface, but disagree about the "why"s of the things they believe in. Your mileage may vary, but it's not always easy to like the other. My experience with ENFJs is I feel like they have my superpowers, but they're using it for evil, and I haven't directly asked but it seems they feel the same.
2	It's not uncommon at least. Just don't avoid disagreements and conflicts, which is usual in F-F friendships. Your only difference is the perc. / judg. but that isn't a problem. They might find you too controlling. Their lack of planning and scheduling might bother you. You're both warm and kind people and that attracts you. Just like you both try to make others happy and fullfil their needs.
1	My best friends are both ENFPs and I love them but also find them somewhat out for themselves. One criticizes me for having lots of damaged friends cause she feels I can do better (better being her). The other doesn’t really know much about me cause she takes much more than she gives in our relationship. It’s safe to say there’s some friction between us 
1	I'm actually bestfriends with an ENFJ and an ENFP! were a trio really and I'm ESTP ooff haha I really love both types. As to what I've observed their relationship is great! though there are times where the ENFP would get bored of the ENFJ. The ENFJ rarely initiates conversations nor endulge on different things unlike the ENFP. Usually I tend to introduce the two to things and join the ENFJ on me and the ENFP's conversations. It cant be avoided that sometimes the ENFJ would feel like an outcast but we try our best! So far its great and its a good team \n\nDont let MBTI be a reason on why you wont hang out with a certain person tho!
1	Yes, ENFP and ENFJ are the same real-world type.
1	I love this! I believe I've always been an ENFJ who went through a "tumbleweed" period of being an ENFP. In that time, I became SUPER close with another ENFP and we were inseparable. In the past few years as I've grown out of/back into my ENFJ, her and I have drifted a little. I think the drifting absolutely comes from the differences in the P/J parts of our personalities. She is both super flaky and too spontaneous ("Hey! I've booked a flight from across the country to see you this weekend!!!") but when we catch up on FaceTime or the phone we are back into our groove. She totally gets my motivations for nearly everything I do, and gives incredible advice on how to handle situations. I'm not sure if this helped, but I think her friendship really showed me the difference in ENFP/ENFJ and how I am DEFINITELY typed correctly :)
1	i'm ENFJ and my last long-term ex is ENFP. we're still very good friends and that won't ever change. we talk about anything from politics to video games. we're also both musicians so we share some of the same tastes in music, which brought us really close while we were together. overall we both know it's not good for us to be together for the long haul, that's why we're just friends now.\n\ni have another friend that i get along really well. whenever we're together our other friends say we're like 2 peas in a pod, like whenever we joke around it's only the 2 of us who get it. i wouldn't be surprised if he's also an ENFP as he embodies some of the qualities.\n\ni'd say ENFJs and ENFPs make for great relationships all around, romantic or not. we motivate each other and complement each other really well as the diplomacy is strong.
13	Dang, I give up!	Hi ENFJs!\n\nINFJ male in his mid 20s here. Despite being extremely anxious around women my age for as long as I can remember, I have always been intrigued in INTx type women because they've always seemed introspective, wise types and I have always had a hard-on for psychology, learning and knowledge in general. Thing is, after interacting with a handful of INTxs, I slowly concluded that while they may be great at logical stuff, I can't imagine them as life partners because of the same. For an emotionally sensitive type like INFJ, they tend to be a bit too cold, emotionally unintelligent and very calculating. Now, hold on! I'm not implying that they're bad people or anything, just stating my opinion based off of my personal experiences that their downsides clash with ours and it blows up quick. Or it may just be that I'm an immature idiot. Either way, I give up on them.\n\nI have been thinking about this stuff for a fair while now. And I realized that perhaps what I have been looking for all along are ENFJs. From what I've read/seen after Fe, their Ti is the next one to develop fast. Which is exactly what I want in a partner. But from personal experience, it can go either way. It can vary from person to person but they're, in general, my next target. Which is where you guys come in. Where do I find a female ENFJ? What do I do to woo her? How to approach her? What are their likes and dislikes? Potential compatibility with a shy INFJ? Any personal experiences? I know they're too many questions but they were formed gradually in my head over the past couple of months as I introspected and concluded that I may have a better shot with ENFJ girls. Just, dammit, I never found one! :[
12	Honestly, you don't find an ENFJ. They find you. XD in seriousness though, I'm a female ENFJ and my best friend through all of high school and college was an INFJ, so needless to say I'm a huge advocate of ENFJ-INFJ relationships. Since ENFJs can be so considerate of other people, they mix well with their "introverted counterpart" the INFJ since they go out of their way to spend time with them, but are also cognizant of when the INFJ needs some space. \n\nAs far as where to find an ENFJ, really just keep your earbuds out and they'll probably be ready to make conversation with you. Make an effort to show up to social events, and you'll find them budding and sprouting. As far as wooing one, really just listening to them and being excited to hear them/be around them will do it. For me, when someone is clearly enjoying my company, I'm stoked and I won't stop talking to them until they seem to be uninterested or they start trying to exist the conversation. Consider reading up on the type's likes and dislikes here: \nhttp://mbtireallife.tumblr.com/post/143287679026/your-enfj-care-and-handling-user-guide-and-manual
4	I mean, many of my best friends and past lovers have been INFJs, and I have the same issue with NTs, so I think you're in a good place.\n\nSince ENFJs spend so much time supporting and encouraging others, I think it's vital that an ENFJ's partner encourages them, and reminds them to take breaks for self-care.\n\nRight now I'm struggling with my INTP husband because in general I do much more of the emotional work in our relationship, and it's a real drag. I'm a teacher and I tell people for a living that they're amazing and they can do it! But I rarely hear these words from my husband, sadly. He tries to show appreciation through actions, but words are more my love language.
5	A little late to the post. ENFJ here, my long-term partner is an INFJ and I think on the whole we're a pretty excellent match. \n\nWe met at an art gallery by chance (though art is a mutual interest). I would suggest joining clubs or social hobbies you're interested in. As others have said, the ENFJ will likely find you. We sniff you introverts out a mile away. Of course I asked him out, but only because it was pretty clear he was also interested (body language). It's okay to be shy so long as you smile. Everyone likes a little mystery.\n\nHow to woo them? Be yourself, listen, share stories, show up on time looking good, have a passion for life and an interest in the world. I have a few INFJ friends and we always have excellent conversations, just talking to them anywhere is more than enough for me, though usually a drink is appreciated. I like people who aren't afraid to explore a range of different subjects.\n\nEvery ENFJ will have different likes and dislikes as we are all individuals, however treating someone as a human with respect and genuine interest is always a good place to start. That and, find some hobbies outside the house and I'm sure you'll bump into your perfect match sooner or later. \n\nGood luck!
3	Right, you end up wanting to see some F but if all she knows how to do is T then you're up shit creek. It's usually possible for people to learn the opposite function over time if they genuinely have interest in it.
2	Have you ever been in a relationship with an INTx?
2	Keep an open mind :P You may stumble across an INTP female like me that is trying SO FREAKING HARD to grow my Fe. My poor ENFJ, he has the patience of a saint :/ but i think it's because he knows I'M REALLY TRYING! To be fair, his F is 51% vs his T, so that probs helps.\n\nWe see each other a couple of hours every two or three weeks and he always begins by asking how I am. I automatically start robotically reciting events that occurred and then I remember that's not what he's really asking. So then, I do an internal check and really try to find those feefees that he really wants to hear about. What I've learned: I don't have complex emotions but they are there. I've also been doing research on how to speak his language and see each meeting as a kind of..."leveling up" in our friendship/relationship. Then he tells me his problems and instead of my instinct of solving them, I nod and say, "I understand." And honestly? I really do! We're so much alike, even though our processes are different! I then always follow up with a text telling him how grateful I am for his attention and how wonderful he is.\n\nThis goes against my every natural instinct, but I'm starting to LIKE it! O_O Anyway, my point: just find you a self-aware NT that's trying to improve herself ^_^ We exist!
2	I agree, the ENFJ will find you, and they will make you their best friend. Don't be surprised when you found one, because most things you will just agree and understand on, like magic.
2	I'm INFJ and an ENFJ found me! :P Just be yourself and let your light shine!
1	The dual aka ideal type match for INFJs is predicted to be ESTP - [**Types for INFJs in relationships**](http://personalitycafe.com/infj-articles/275-love-types-infj-12.html#post10082378) - but female ESTPs might be hard to find and not all of them have discovered that IxFx men form best complimentary match to them. Other ExxP types such as ESFP and ENTP girls are also good matches, and among introverted sensors ISTPs and ISFPs for encouraging that Se in INFJ. ENFJs can prove to be a good match but I've found it's too much of the same thing (too much of same functions) and this match is better for friendship and intellectual conversations.
1	INFJ tourist too. Oh god I so agree about INTJs! I thought that I wanted one, but I had the utter bad luck to meet one who doesn't value emotions as valuable data to take into consideration. He hurt me by not consulting my opinion to plan something with me, trying to impose his decision, and then said that he doesn't like drama! So I'm here too XD\n\nI guess that INFJ can bond with ENFJ with their F, by being compassionate with each other. The E encouraging the I to try new things, maybe the I helping the E relax more... Well, I don't know, but good luck to you!
1	Things that bug me	Hey guys, male ENFP here. I love you guys a lot (I made an appreciation post here for y’all earlier in the year), but I need some advice/validation that I’m not crazy or stupid. \n\nI’m a student at UT Austin, and like any other well known four year university with a large student body, I find myself in the company of a lot of ENFJ’s. Like, a lot. I know a lot of them through student orgs (which is where they tend to gravitate to) and I’ve befriended a shit ton of them. \n\nThey’re for the most part really awesome people who genuinely respect me, which is great, but I find myself feeling annoyed or uncomfortable around them because of certain tendencies they have. \n\nHere’s a list of things they do that really get on my nerves:\n\n* When we’re going clubbing downtown, they’re in a corner on their phones only hanging out and dancing with each other and not interacting with the rest of the group.\n\n* Instead of genuinely having a good time or enjoying the night, they’re trying to plan or scheme something or handle some problem, it’s almost like they have to constantly be doing something other than what the rest of the group is doing. \n\n* Acting differently in a group setting with other people than they do with me one on one. I personally believe that it’s not our place to judge anyone else, so we shouldn’t have to pretend to be anyone other than who we really are, and we should accept the good and bad parts of all people and create a comfortable enough environment for us to be the true versions of ourselves. I wish they wouldn’t have to pretend. \n\n\n* Always pretending like everything is okay, even when things are not okay. This gets to me the most because even when I try to give them the benefit of the doubt and relax/have a good time, I can always tell when they’re not acting the way they normally do around certain people (myself included). I’m down to help them talk through their issues, but they always deny that there are any and tell me I have nothing to worry about. \n\nDo any of these ring a bell to any of you? If they do, am I going about them the right way? Are my feelings of annoyance at these different character traits warranted? Am I missing something here? Please lmk what you think. \n
9	Why personality types are your parents?	
5	My father is ESTP, my mother is INFJ. My father is extremely astute, creative, very in-the-moment, and absolutely blunt. My mother is deeply organized, instinctive, adaptable, motivational, and kind. Those would be the two types I think they fit the best, and the personalities I've heard others who know them well label them with.\n\nInterestingly enough, my father doesn't struggle with pure theory that much, at least compared to other ESTPs. If you didn't know him that well you wouldn't think of him as particularly intelligent because he's very practical and has a very tall, wide-shouldered, muscular appearance and is very humble overall.\n\nYou can have a very detailed discussion with him about linguistics, but ultimately he prefers to go about his daily life in a typical ESTP way. My mother is *extremely* intuitive to an almost paranormal level, especially when it comes to the emotions and intentions of others.\n\nTheir marriage is a bit unusual since they're polar opposites that don't usually mesh well. I'd say it's because my father is extremely passionate about many of the things my mother is, and he can understand her need for intuition. They often help each other either get back down to earth and vice versa. Interestingly enough, I married an INFJ which makes a bit more sense compatibility-wise. 
3	Mom- ISFJ- my mom and I tend to clash a lot because my Ni is flighty and stubborn and her Si is solid and stubborn. She can’t get over the past and often tells me things along the lines of “you were so loving in the past and now you barely spend time with us” but that’s a story for another day. She spends a lot of time in routine. She’s extremely family oriented and is naturally more than a receiver than an initiated. \n\nDad- ISTJ?- im not gonna lie i really don’t know what my father is. I’ve been trying to figure it out for a few years now and he perplexes me. He’s very closed off. I trust him more than my mother in terms of keeping me safe and helping me become a man. He seems to be very stoic and consistent. He doesn’t express emotion too much except for pride and anger (though that’s totally different when we’re all together laughing).  He seems to make lots of judgments that resemble Ni judgments, but they tend to be incorrect and based on how he would feel and know things were when he was my age. He’s a slow thinker, which is why I feel that Ti is more logical than Te when typing him, but I think ISTJ is the best fit. Boy, does he like when things are done the right way\n\nOlder brother- ISFP- he was an artist whose Se was too strong. He turned to drugs, but at least now he’s a talented electric guitar player and straight up goth \n\nMe- ESFJ- one of these is not like the other, and it’s always been me\n\nYounger sister- INFP- she was my best friend growing up (and boy was her Fi hard to deal with when her other functions had yet to develop)\n\n
3	Mom: ISFJ\nDad: ESTJ\n\nMy mom is the kindest, sweetest human being I’ve ever known. She does not have a mean bone in her body. She’s an incredibly nurturer/protector, and is very cheerful and animated. On top of all this, she’s extremely loyal, trustworthy, intelligent, and genuine.\n\nMy dad is extremely loyal, practical, worldly, and authentic. He is also very protective of his family, but is more outgoing than my mom. He is very fun-loving and spontaneous, but can also be strict when necessary. Additionally, he’s very organized, an awesome leader, and talented at everything he does.
3	Father: Typical INFP. Head in the clouds, artist, sensitive, the whole shabang. \n\nMother: Fiercely dominant ENTJ. Career woman who struggles with showing any emotion or affection. \n\nIt was quite interesting being raised by two parents who have what some may consider to be flipped gender roles. They were good for each other for a while, as my mom helped to motivate my dad, and my dad helped to relax my mom. However, due to having SO many fundamental differences, they eventually divorced. Thankfully they have remained friends, and we all like to laugh about how in the world the were ever married in the first place. 
5	Father: ENFP who lives out of his extroverted thinking relief function way too much (looks like he’s problem solving, but he never actually finds solutions and just freaks out everyone around him trying to get advice in order to order his anxiety).\n\nMother: possibly was an INFJ or INFP. I lean toward the former, as she lived out of extroverted feeling a lot and was prone to black and white views on morality and people. She also was very much inclined to be a loner, but everyone around her loved her. \n\nI’m the oldest: ENFJ, brother is middle: ESTJ, sister is youngest: ENFP
2	Dad: ISTJ\nMom: ENFJ\nSister (bonus): ESTJ
2	Mom ISTJ\nDad ESFP
2	ESFJ mother: loves to hang out with friends, but only has a smaller than ideal circle, usualy only two or three, and they go out shopping and have lunch. At home she is always working, studying uni home work or doing the chores, or teaching piano. She never has anytime for rest until bed time where she sits beside her bed and reads her bible. She follows her routines religiously and has an unmoving belief for what she was taught when she was young. She tries to talk with me and ask how my day was but i really cant respond to those dumb questions, like i have to report everything to her.\n\nENTJ dad: my dad really lives me and he tries to show it through 'tough love', teaching me through his own punishments, but it was really lucky that i figured out that before i really held a deep grudge towards him. He definitely has difficulty showing him emotions and sometimes posts pictures of flowers, which is very different from my impression of him when he dominates conversations whenever he observes some logic being misused or misplaced. Very efficient in time management, and always very quick to critique actions. I wish he could just leave me alone to learn myself.\n
2	Father: INFJ\nMother: ENFP
2	Father- XNFJ\nMother- INTP\n
1	ISFJ-T mum very strict and likes to think people try to argue with her if they are disagreeing, and can be very controllive and can guilt trip you (using her shadow functions alot).\nDad- ISFP-A very much comfortable with himself, and definitely not a people person though he can have a conversation with people. Extremely musical and very traditional and sentimental. He definitely fits the stereotype!

2	WhatsApp group for all personality types	
17	ENFJ Roast?	Give us your best shot. 
44	Why not deal with your own problems before giving me advice that clearly doesn't work for yourself. 
27	Keep doing favors for me. It’s not like you’re gonna say “no” anyway
19	Why are you so sensitive?
15	Thanks for your support. Ok see ya later. 
15	I know it’s hard to wait your turn, but try listening for once.
11	Stop getting off on my problems. 
11	Stop being so stubborn. Tell me before I've ticked you off so far that you get angry. It's not harmony or the highway, there are degrees between.
10	Y SO MANIPULATIVE? Its kinda worse than ENTJs' assholery because it is subtle.
9	LOL! You're the kind of guy who won't come in from a thunderstorm while mowing the lawn because you need it done now.
10	Why do you give us a statement and expect us to take it as a question? Why do you start conversations with "So I'm doing this~" then feel unappreciated when nobody then asks for details? Why can't you just give us the details without us having to say "...Go oon"?
7	I just wanna bs, stop turning this into a counseling session. 
8	Best way of cheering an ENFJ (F) up?	INFJ M but recently my ENFJ F always calls out how much I suck at making her happy. I’m running out of ideas how and is really trying my best to make her happy when she’s feeling down or sad! Thanks.
11	I've found that a lot of ENFJs, including me to some extent, like to feel that they are living up to their potential to help others. Affirming that in some way, verbally or otherwise, seems like the way to go. 
8	ENFJs always try to keep the people around them happy so I’d say check to see if you are happy when with her and if she’s making you happy, show her that she makes you happy! We also just really want to be loved and cared for without asking for it. So go out of your way to surprise her. Show up when she isn’t expecting you to and bring her little things like a chocolate or tea aha. Or... just simple texts throughout the day to remind her that she’s on your mind. Personally, when I’m feeling down I just want to be hugged and listened to. You don’t have to say much just listen to her and tell her that she’s got you. Make her feel safe. \n\nAhh this makes me miss a certain INFJ 😔\n\nGood luck though :) 
3	Probably just reminding them how strong they are. ENFJ shouldn't be getting pissed at you for failing to cheer them up, they have that power inside them already. Do something that she likes/that reminds her of herself.
2	Usually the reason I feel that people “suck at making me happy” in a relationship is that they focus too much on the superficial stuff. Instead of looking for things to do for her that seem like grand gestures, think about her as a person. Odds are, the things you’re trying to do may feel hollow because they may seem to her like a catch-all for “what girls like”.\nShe will appreciate you a) showing appreciation for the consideration she shows you (like genuinely), and b) showing interest/ appreciation for things that are personal to her. If you cannot think of anything, honestly just ask. My mother and I are both ENFJ’s and about a month before each of our birthdays, we ask each other, “what do you want?” and get each other exactly that. The sentiment is, I would much rather give you/ do exactly what you want without a “surprise” factor, rather than waste energy on something you won’t appreciate.\nThe idea with ENFJs is that we put so much effort into making people happy because we see any effort without the perfect outcome as superfluous and counterproductive.\nHope this helped! May be a little blunt but it’s where my head goes in the context of similar situations
8	Hey people! I'm starting a subreddit devoted to hippie culture, self-discovery, love, peace and related topics. I thought some of you might be interested :)	
20	ENFJs and asking for/letting people help?	Im an ENFJ female and I've always really enjoyed helping others and being relied on. It's just something that makes me feel useful and have purpose (for example, helping to cheer friends up or listen to how their day was, or giving people rides home/bringing sick friends chicken noodle soup). I've noticed though that this is something most ENFJs enjoy to some extent. \n\nHowever, I've been more aware lately that I not only don't ask for help with things, but I actually strongly dislike it. I don't like talking about my own problems or issues, and I can't stand the idea of inconveniencing others. Is this something that's typical for ENFJs? Does anyone else have any experiences with this? 
7	Yes, I'd say it's typical. It's typical for me.\n\nI also think this phenomenon is exacerbated by the fact that when you're good at helping others, people tend to take advantage of that (with either benign or malevolent intentions), which doesn't leave much room for reciprocity.\n\nIn other words, if you're seen as the happy person with all the solutions, you're usually not expected to also be a sad person with your own problems.\n\nI think I grew up more like you--learning to mull over my problems by myself, and even associating having struggles with being weak or "bad." My parents unintentionally reinforced these attitudes; they praised me for being a little adult who never acted out, when really I was just regular kid with needs and frustrations that I got good at swallowing. It wasn't healthy, and I've paid (both in cash for therapy, and otherwise) to develop better tools for self-care, and boundaries.\n\nAlthough I still believe that the best way I can contribute to society is via helping others, I've gotten a lot better at more or less scheduling mandatory self-care and knowing when to exit a situation that's leeching all my energy. Paradoxically, I know that caring for myself is the best way to care for others.
1	If I need help, I literally just ask people for it. That's what friends for.\n\nThere are always things impossible for you to bear alone. You need someone else to share that problem, and make it easier for yourself to solve.
1	>Is this something that's typical for ENFJs?\n\nYes.
1	Facts boo... 
1	How do you define a good friend?	Title says it all.
9	For me, it's someone who makes me forget to think about how I should be acting. When I'm around different people, I have to think about acting in a different way (different topics, tones, how much to talk). But, with a really good friend, I walk away and realize that I haven't given any conscious thought to the kind of person I wanted to act like since we started talking. There's something really special about that to me.
5	Someone who is morally sound and consistent. Someone who places the same attention on the inward as the outward. We motivate each other to improve ourselves physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. I've learned to put quality over quantity when it comes to truly close friends. 
5	Someone who I'm comfortable around. I have a lot of friends, but I keep a "fake" personality around most due to fearing I'll lose them if I act "normally". My best friends are all the people who I can be myself around
3	Someone who sticks around / is there for you when life gets tough. Too many people are simply 'fairweather friends'.
18	ENFJ and addiction	Hello my darlings!!\n\nI was wondering if there are any ENFJs here who also have some sort of addiction problem? I would love to have a chat and see how people have coped, recovered and took care of themselves. :)\n
11	As an ENFJ, I can say that I definitely have an addictive personality.\n\nFor example, I was addicted to porn for a long time - to the extent to which it was pretty much consuming my energy and seriously contributed to my severe anxiety - but was easily able to give it up when I started going out with a girl I’d really liked. It was almost as I’d forgotten porn had ever existed.\n\nI reason I was so addicted to the porn was because I’d recently moved house to a new city - I had fewer friends, fewer people I could talk to and thus turned to porn as something to cling on to in search of some kind of companionship. Once I found **real** companionship, I no longer needed the porn to satisfy my urges.\n\nI know that addiction can be extremely varied based on the substance and the user, but I feel like the same process of rehabilitation still applies for almost everyone: if the user has a group of people who they can trust and often social with, then they will find it much easier to ease themselves off of the substance as they will no longer find themselves reliant on the substance for happiness.\n\nBut don’t take my word for it, I’m only 15. I think [this video](https://youtu.be/ao8L-0nSYzg) sums it up pretty well.
5	I am extremely prone to addiction. For me, it's simply wanting more of anything that makes me feel good, regardless of what it is. So how I end up recovering/coping is taking a step back and really analyzing the situation to understand what I've gotten myself into. \n\nUnfortunately this happens when I've gone too far. My preventative measure now is to think twice before getting started with anything, as I tend to naturally act on my emotions.
2	I've only seen an ENFJ get addicted to prescription shit by the doctors. Until the very end she could not comprehend there is little difference between street drugs and pills in regard to dependence.
2	[deleted]
1	I really wish I could help in a more meaningful way that comes from that place. I’m a female ENFJ, but I’ve never had an addiction problem. I can give you my two cents on why I don’t have an addiction problem. I knew myself well since a young age like what I expected from myself and living by my values and principles. This of course limited some of my experiences/freedoms. \n\nYou can have self control by setting rules for yourself and following them, knowing your values, and having principles to keep you from crossing a line for yourself.\n\nIt takes A LOT of practice especially if it’s new to being self controlled or disciplined in this kind of way. You have to fight it every day until eventually it’s not an issue. 
3	What are some examples of your favorite ENFJ Villains / Antagonists from fiction?	
8	Melisandre, from Game of Thrones. Her exile from the North actually made me kind of sad. All of my friends were so confused why, but I understood that she legitimately thought she was helping others.\n\nAlso, apparently Gul Dukat and Khan from Star Trek are ENFJs, and I love them both. They are so dynamic, and emotional. 
3	Loki from the Avengers and other MCU films.
1	One I've recently typed is Ryoko Asakura from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.\n\nMy description:\n\nThe main characters Kyon’s and Haruhi’s classmate. She is a very friendly girl and the most popular kid in class with both the girls and the guys, and is the class president. In truth, she is a humanoid interface sent by the Data Overmind to observe Haruhi Suzumiya.\n\n\n**Extraverted Feeling - Fe**\n\nShe frequently cares for and provides support to all her classmates, trying to make everyone feel included. As a result, she is popular with everyone and is elected class president. Though to a large extent this is done to enable her to achieve her assignment to observe Haruhi, this function is the primary means by which she tries to accomplish it. She frequently shows caring and concern to Haruhi as well in order to get her to open up (and by this collect data from her), but when Haruhi doesn’t respond Ryoko resorts to using her other functions.\n\nWe know she leads with a judging function, because she frequently makes and/or leads with conclusive statements that show her judgment, such as, “Well, it definitely looks like you guys are having a lot of fun, but you know, yesterday’s stuff was a little overboard”; “Don’t go asking for trouble like that!”; and “But you know, my superiors are extremely stubborn and lack any vision whatsoever.” And unfortunately for everyone involved, once she’s made up her mind about something she won’t change it.\n\nHer use of Fe comes off bizarre when she’s trying to kill Kyon, when she’s fighting Yuki Nagato, and while she’s dissolving away, but that is likely because she does not have to face death like a normal human does.\n\n\n**Introverted Intuition - Ni**\n\nShe frequently tries to look at the reasons why someone is doing something, and look at it from their perspective, such as when Kyon said she was joking when she first came at him with a knife: “You think it’s a joke? Huh. You don’t wanna die? You don’t want me to kill you? I’m sorry, but I just don’t understand the concept of death regarding organic life forms.” She also looks at her life and decide her actions through general philosophical principles, such as when she sas, "It's better to do something and regret it, then to regret not doing anything." She can look at the progression of events and see she’s not getting any closer to her goal of getting a response and thus data from Haruhi, leading her to…\n\n\n**Extraverted Sensing - Se**\n\n…try to force things, but she ends up going overboard: "I’m getting bored and just fed up watching something that doesn’t seem to be changing at all. That’s why I’m going to kill you and see how Miss Suzumiya reacts.“ Now her being a member of the Radical faction may partly explain her behavior here, but we can see various attempts to change things in her classroom to enable her to get data from Haruhi, such as when she tries to get Kyon to watch Haruhi for her where he would then would pass the data along to her, and when Haruhi is depressed interacts with her trying to get some sort of response.\n\n\n**Introverted Thinking - Ti**\n\nDuring her attempt on Kyon’s life, she turns the space into a data jurisdiction which is supposed to prevent all entry and exit from that space, but it has a lot of security flaws, allowing Yuki to detect and enter it. This suggests that she doesn’t have a very good framework for implementing the technical details of her plan. Also, she failed to realize Yuki's strategy until it was too late. This all suggests Ti is her inferior function.

10	My INTP husband said my argument was invalid because I was basing it on anecdotal evidence, and then he proceeded to use anecdotal evidence.\n\nHUSBAND I will play on your NT playing field but if you're going to change the rules, the game is over.
5	Half of my friends despise me atm and I’m incredibly stressed since I have so much to do and not enough time to do it all.
3	Feeling like my life is being put on a pause. I was getting myself in many difficult situations a couple months ago just feeling one temporary high after another (was on a dating rampage just trying to find someone who I can lock down to care for me) and now that I really did find a calm that I want to keep forever, I am not well enough to keep my anxieties at bay. I never got the time to let go of the hurt and the emotional baggages from before and now I've introduced a bit of a storm into my calmness that I had to let him go/ The timing of meeting him bothers me but yesterday at church the message was exactly what I needed to hear and that is to just let things be. I just need to take some time to heal. 
2	I'm finishing up a Masters program, but haven't yet lined up a job.  I'm confident that I will land somewhere, but the uncertainty of the how, when, where is driving me a bit bonkers.
2	[deleted]
2	A new friend (ESTP) is trying to push a physical relationship too fast. I'm caught between anxiety/backing off and wanting to YOLO. I'm trying to define what I actually want now, and mustering courage to explain and put my foot down... Wish me luck lol
2	Late to the party but here it goes. I fell for someone (ENFP) who doesn’t know what he wants. He’s on the fence about moving to my city and being together, yet he texts me every morning and all day and mentions what our kids would be like and how he wants to meet my family (overseas). It’s extremely confusing and I didn’t know how on the fence he was until I asked him point blank. So, realizing that I was too invested in something that was much less solid than I thought, I decided I needed to cut things off completely to protect myself from getting even more hurt later. I’ve known him for years and definitely want to preserve our friendship, but I have to separate myself from the situation for a while and it sucks. I asked him to not text me until I’m detached and today is Day 1 of not receiving a “good morning beautiful” from him. I feel like I’m never going to find someone who cares about me like I will for them. 
1	I went to college and I’m now dropping out partially due to financial restrictions and partly due to mental health. I want to make sure that when I return home after I finish up my semester everything is planned out and perfect. Most importantly, I need to know who’s here for me and who isn’t. A lot of my friends are sort of living in limbo and I feel I can’t rely on them. Particularly one friend who manipulates and scolds me and still expects my love. I can’t really drop friends but I also fear they’re dropping me. Overall I’m very confused 
1	I'm not sure what to do with my life and can't for the life of me find motivation.\n\nThere are other semi-related things that bother me more, but they are too dark to post here.
10	I need some advice about my ENFJ and managing his stress.	Hi everybody. I've fallen hard for a wonderful ENFJ. He is the hardest working, most giving person I've ever known and I admire him so much that I'm kind of like a crazed fan girl. But the one area that he struggles with is managing his anxiety and stress. \n\nOne thing that helps me quite a bit is to make lists and plans. But for him, he finds this tactic very stress inducing as his mind just takes off and tries to work on every task on the list at once. And plans that are very far in the future  (even one week ahead) cause him to obsess about that one event or whatever it is.  \n\nWhat happens then without plans, is that every day is a surprise. And he has to tackle each need or task as it comes.  He's an incredibly strong person but it's like he's under constant fire because he can't look more than a day ahead. He has low periods but because he's so strong he bounces back and continues to endure.  \n\nIn these low periods what can I do to help? Is there any chance of changing his behaviour to help better manage his gargantuan load of responsibilities or is that a pipe dream? \n\nI'm dying to just make a list with him and talk about what needs to be done and make a plan and a routine but he just can't do it. \n\nAny advice or insight would be so appreciated! Thank you! 
5	First, this doesn't sound like ENFJ behavior to me. \n\nEvery ENFJ I know (including myself) is a natural list-maker, and can not only plan many tasks into the future, but enjoys doing so. Even /u/sushi-n-sunshine mentions list-making. \n\nAlso, these behaviors\n\n>  his mind just takes off and tries to work on every task on the list at once\n\n> plans that are very far in the future (even one week ahead) cause him to obsess about that one event or whatever it is.\n\nseem a bit more P to me, or even SP (since plans stress Ps out, and Ss prefer to focus on details in the present).\n\nI would cruise the [Personality Type Portraits](https://www.personalitypage.com/html/portraits.html) page and see if ENFJ really is his best fit. For example, this quote from the ENFJ page doesn't sound like the way you're describing him *Living in the world of people possibilities, they enjoy their plans more than their achievements. They get excited about possibilities for the future...*\n\nSecond, it's difficult to "manage" someone's stress for them. Ultimately, you can only provide so many suggestions before a person needs to learn to help themselves, and you can't stop the feelings of stress they're experiencing in their bodies. Pulling back might be best both for him *and* you. On his own, your (boyfriend?) might be more inclined to find system that works for him, whatever that looks like. For you, you can focus on your own life vs. trying to "manage" his.\n\nThird, is this something he even wants to change? Many people's "stressful" behavior only looks stressful to others, and is the norm for them. I'm not sure, but at least this post doesn't contain any language like, "He really wants to improve at this but doesn't know how, so he asked me to ask reddit for help." \n
5	This totally sounds like something I would do. Tbh, I’ve never been much of a “list maker” myself. I can relate to him atm because I have a million things to get done and it’s stressing me out. When I have to do stressful activities that I don’t want to do, I’m most certainly not going to want to make lists and plan out when to do it. I usually just wake up one day, try to determine what I plan on getting done that day, and usually don’t get any of it done because I’m a major procrastinator and don’t have much motivation to get anything done. \n\nNot completely sure what you can do to help him manage his stress better. However, I’ll tell you what helps me when I’m stressed. When I’m stressed out or under any kind of emotional distress in general, it helps me a lot for me to discuss how I feel with someone who I trust. However, I hate wallowing in my stress and discussing my negative feelings for long periods of time. I have friends who are great listeners and are always willing to listen when I need to vent but whenever I’m done, they’ll change the topic to something unrelated, distract me, and make me laugh. So, I suggest that you go do something with him to distract him from the cause of the stress. Heck, even have a conversation with him that’s not about the cause of his stress. It helps me a lot to get distracted from what I’m stressing over and once the conversation is over, I usually feel much better and forget why I was so distressed in the first place.\n\nHope this helps!
2	I don't know if an individual's way of thinking can be changed, but you could definitely help him reduce his stress. \n\nYou could maybe sit down with him and get him to (calmly) write down everything he can think of that he needs to do. Then you can sort the events in order of importance and in order of deadlines. He could choose 2 or 3 or more things, or however many he wants to do, that he thinks he can complete in a day (within reason). Then it's just a matter of writing it down on a to-do list for each day and calmly finishing them one by one, crossing them off as he goes. If in a few days, he isn't finishing everything he wants to each day, then make the list smaller if you can. \n\nAs an ENFJ as well, I also get stressed out sometimes when I'm thinking about what seems to be an insane amount of things to do, but once I write them down or verbalize them, it doesn't seem as bad as it was before. Hopefully this helps you and him out :)
8	Advice on Not Getting Used?	I feel like I’ve been used.\n\nI met some great people in my college last year and became close to many of them. I even started catching feelings for an INFP friend after getting so close with her and helping her out a dark place. For all I’ve done, I realized a few weeks ago that I’ve been getting walked over and used.\n\nI saw that my “friends” wouldn’t ever reach out to me unless they needed something. The girl I’ve been in love with was asking for favors for an entire week and besides that, she would never reach out to me. \n\nThis hurts. I feel that I’ve sacrificed a lot, resolves conflicts for my friends, and in the end, I get pushed to the side and called back only for favors. Even this weekend, I told my friends I was going home and one of them texted me last night because she lost something and needed my code to get into the building.\n\nI tried to take time for all of the them for the past 3 weeks and have seen that nobody even bothers to reach out to me. Whenever I do, I feel desperate and I feel like being by myself long enough will allow them to see that they miss my company. \n\nWorst part is that the college is small and everyone has their friends already. The only thing I’m hopeful for is that this summer, all my friends and even the girl will be together because of summer classes for our major. Because it will just be us, I feel optimistic that things will be better. But right now, I have little motivation to even do well in school when I have no one to talk to or spend time with through the stress. \n\nHave any other ENFJs felt this way? Any advice on overcoming it?\n\nEdit: Tense corrections
5	set boundaries immediately. you're becoming *that* friend who can be relied on, but too much. it'll be hard because of the extroversion, but try not to be contactable for at least a week. make yourself busy.
5	I can relate. Sometimes being selfless is a form of overcompensating for another area in your life. It took me a few years to come to terms with how to filter for quality friends who give back.
4	I feel it the same way.\n\nENFJs are just like the name this sub has, The Giver.\n\nPeople seem to always take our kindness/goodness for granted. It really hurts when you sense the other one is not responding the adequate feedback you need. Sometimes it's just they reach out to you, sometimes it's they need to show their emotions to you. \n\nYou can't just be the person who always gives out whatever you have for them, most of the time I feel like I'm all alone doing the good. It makes me look like an idiot.\n\nPeople take your good for granted are trash people, stay away from them. 
2	Can definitely relate. First of all, your “friends” sound like really trashy people for using you like that. But don’t worry, someday you’ll find friends who like you for who you are and not just call you up when they need something.\n\nUntil then, I agree with what another commenter said about setting boundaries. If you want them to stop asking you for favors constantly, you have to stop doing favors for them. Be unavailable. Tell them that you’re having a busy week and can’t make time to do whatever they need you to do. I know it’s hard since we love doing things for others and can be such people pleasers sometimes, but it’s the only way to make them stop. By doing this, they’ll realize that you’re not instantly going to stop what you’re doing to attend to them whenever they need something. Also, if they stop speaking to you just because you’re not doing things for them, then that shows you that they’re definitely fake friends and not people that you want in your life.
2	Was just going through this actually... so I completely understand how you feel. \nI had a huge wave of seasonal depression and when I reached out to my friends they weren't there for me. I think the most logical ENFJ reaction is to distance yourself from them and that was what I had done. I cut off connections with them feeling hurt and went into this self-pitying mode.. But it was all that was on my mind for the 2 months after. Finally I couldn't handle it not knowing why they could just do that to me and contacted them. It turned out they were both going through things themselves. Using MBTI to further explain, one of them is an ISTP and his logical and introverted side made him choose to focus on solving his problems before caring for mine and the other is an INFJ who needed space while I needed company.\nDuring this time I also found myself reaching out to people only when I need help. And despite feeling bad about "using them" I realized that I wasn't in a good position to help others at the time. \n\nIn summary, just from my own experience, I think we need to be more understanding of other people's circumstances as well as their "functions". \n\nI completely understand your feeling of little motivation and stress rn and I think it'll help for you to look for a friend that you've never reached out to. In the last month I've decided to expand my support system a bit more. I don't know if this is an ENFJ thing but I've always been one of those people who can talk to quite a lot of people but only have a select few that I consider "my people" and when I have problems and those people turn out to be busy I feel like I am not loved. (and also the feeling of giving your all in a relationship only to not have that reciprocated is very very present). Lately I read an article about how ENFJ is always looking for that proof of unconditional love and I think it's definitely true. We often find ourselves giving and helping and caring for the people around us and we wish others to do the same. I think we just need to change our mindsets from I love so they should love back to I love because I love loving and if they are not capable of caring for me right now, that's okay. I'm learning to ditch that idea of having someone as your person. \n\nThe past 5 days I've actually escaped to the city to be with a friend that is mentally healthy and isn't stressed who could take care of me and just let me take my mind off of things. She wasn't one of the people that I considered close before but just having her here made me feel very very loved. I think that's just what all ENFJ need in times of stress, a little bit of care. \n\nAll the best to you, if you need to talk, feel free to message me :) 
4	Help: INFP with ENFJ starting to fall in love with me.	A few months ago, I commented on an ENFJ girl's YouTube video over INFP and ENFJ interactions. Recently, I met a much older ENFJ, and the chemistry with her was absolutely amazing. I commented on the same video to the same girl about my experience.\n\nA few days later, she finds me on social media and starts to message me. She said she wants INFP friends, so I offer to be her friend. We talk every day for several weeks. I mean, this chemistry is powerful. Every ENFJ I have spoken to has been very powerful and magnetic. We could completely be ourselves, although her Fe gave her a harder time being completely comfortable, I began to make her feel that way.\n\nShe joked with me, telling me to stop being so perfect because she might fall in love with me. I was starting to give her butterflies. Our conversations could be fun or deep, and we could talk about several things at once and have multiple conversations, just like with the other ENFJ I talked to. She told me recently that she had been dreaming of me, and the dream was very personal and intimate, and that she took a personality test to see what her ideal type was and she lied about it. Instead of it being her boyfriend's type like she had told me, it had been mine.\n\nShe said she had never intended on starting to become attached to me. I told her that I felt similarly about her, and that I needed her in my life, and I didn't want to not be friends with her just because our chemistry was too powerful. We are giving it another shot. My question is, what should I do?\n\nI don't want to ruin her relationship. I am not obsessed with her or anything, but I care about her a lot. I am okay with not being with her. There are plenty of other highly compatible people, including ENFJs, out there. She said she needed me in her life in one way or another. Her Ni also told her that it didn't see me in her distant future, which worries me that we would have to cut contact.
3	Infp here. You are not ruining her relationship. She is very capable of making her own decisions. 
3	You guys are both relying way too much on MBTI types. Also, you when someone in a relationship starts flirting with you / complaining about their partner, it will never end well. Maintain healthy boundaries and stop messing with people in relationships. It doesn't speak highly of her character anyways. You don't 'just connect' with people. She sought you out.

5	INTP/ENFJ Becoming Closer Or is it just Fe?	Ok, I've been here a million times. Just click my name for all the millions of past entries about my lovely ENFJ and our progress :P I'm back for two reasons: deciphering/interpreting Fe and for any INTPs that are furiously googling about their intended target XD\n\n\nSo, ENFJ and I got drunk - separately - one night. Lo and behold, I got some revealing texts! He jokingly said that drinking gave him the courage to do things he wouldn't normally do and that I shouldn't go anywhere he wasn't that night and he wanted to spend the night together (unfortunately, it was too last minute and a no go for either of us). We flirted a bit. I basically told him that if he ever wanted to enter the realm of feelings for each other, I'd be willing. (Yes, I was drunk but that's not untrue.) He said he wasn't ready yet and that he was still getting over his last relationship. I thought that meant he was still in love with her and left it at that.\n\n\nApparently that little experience broke some ice with us and we started talking more often. He started arranging "meetings" at a coffee shop for us that always last at least 3 hours and has gone up to near 5. Our phone calls are usually no less than an hour. This has allowed me to reassess many things:\n\n\n- He appears to put me on a pedestal? I'm uncomfortable with this. I get a strong sense that he feels he's not good enough for me but I am a massively flawed human being. When ENFJs discover their friends aren't perfect, will they stick around?\n\n\n- We hug every time we come in contact, sometimes more than once. Neither of us are really huggers, normally.\n\n\n- He called me and asked me to meet him at our coffee shop one day after working straight through the night with no sleep. (I always let him arrange the meetings. He's a bit of a control freak. I like it.) He fell asleep and overslept. I messaged him that I would wait for him until a set time and that it was no big deal, I knew he needed sleep. Half an hour later, just as I was leaving, he called me, frantic and apologizing profusely. He then asked me to wait for him and RAN (like a mile) the whole way! He then spent two hours telling me all about a current life problem and briefly touched on the subject of his ex.\n\n\n- I don't think he's still in love with his ex. They're only broke up like 6 months and I think he's still dealing with the stuff she put him through. She basically made him feel unimportant and was unbothered when he called the relationship off. I think the relationship damaged him pretty deeply.\n\n\nOk, here's where I'd like some insight. Although we've both admitted a strong physical attraction to one another, a romantic relationship is not on the table for now - honestly, I'm really not ready - BUT I really feel like he could be in my inner circle (we both admitted we currently have no one in our inner circle) and my best friend for life. Am I interpreting his friendly Fe as more than it actually is? He has said there's a book he wants to get me and refers to us as a "team" and a "we." He always says, "We're in this together!" "We're one in a million!" "Caffeine will be the death of us both!" That sort of thing. He talks about me to his friends but hasn't officially introduced me to them. We have met but in a work capacity. He always makes time for me and almost hinted at us taking a tour of Europe together. As an INTP, all my emotions are in little boxes and I want to open my "deeper friendship" box with him but I'm worried I've misinterpreted the typical ENFJ friendliness. Is there inner circle potential there?
3	Looks to me like close friends is definitely something that you two are.
2	I would never behave this way if I didn't want to at least be close friends with someone. Especially the "we" and "us" language. Words are very important to me.
2	I'm an enfj, and I wouldn't run a mile to meet you unless I want you in my inner circle.  (ok, i'm not a huge runner, but still).  It sounds to me like you two are dancing around it - he may think he's been pretty clear about his intentions - (I'm married to an INTP, and on our first date, I asked him what his intentions were. He took it in stride and thought about it, before answering - anyway, that way I knew we were exclusive and romantic - it does seem the only obvious way to me, to figure out where the other person's head is at).\n\nI know it sounds super awkward, but I'd consider just asking him, "hey, i know we hang out a lot, but i want to make sure we're on the same page - are we in each other's inner circle?"  I ~think~ his response will be something along the line of 'of course,' but even if it isn't (so unlikely, given all the details you posted), at least you'll know and not be tormented anymore.
2	As usual, the advice is to be direct, and ask ?
2	As I was reading this, it showed me that I act the same way with this INFP girl I’m in love with. Our close relationship began with each of us confiding in one another with all the shit in our lives. I’ve drunk texted her a few times being very flirty but I’ve never said anything direct about feelings. I’m very sure she knows how I feel about her because I can’t stop telling her how much I appreciate her. \n\nDon’t worry about ENFJs leaving because of something trivial like not meeting expectations. If anything, all her flaws and her explanations for how she has a lot of problems makes her seem so genuine to me. I really appreciate that. \n\nI know smothering can feel a bit uncomfortable sometimes but ENFJs can get caught doing that, especially if they really do like that person - at least I do. \n\nWhen it comes to those sleepless nights and still making time for you, that is definitely a sign he values the time you share. Even with the hugging I always have an urge or at least touch the girl I’m into and if he’s doing that often, again, it does like you. Even with all the talk about his ex, I’ve been there. But I was over her. I was only bringing it up because it allowed us to enter a transparent setting where I was trying to get her to feel comfortable with sharing her secrets and feelings. It’s not manipulation of anything, I’ll get person for the sake of redirecting the conversation to be about the person I’m interested in.\n\nHe definitely cares about you in a special way but what that translates to is up to you guys.
1	My best friend is INFP.\n\nMy girlfriend is ESFP. We click on the FP. However, my girlfriend could not be as caring as my best friend. She's a little bit too much of herself, she always forgets my existence and goes away to have fun herself. I figure that's where the ES come in. So literally in the relationship I have to take care of everything for her, since I can't rely on her but she needs to rely on me. Maybe, kind of... You know, ENFJ, we just do stuff and do stuff if we are really into it.\n\nSo, yeah, I think it'll be a better match for INFP and ENFJ. Since both can understand each other on a deeper level, not like ESFP. 
-1	dont trust FJs  \njust do ur own thing and ignore whatever they say or do, that can change very fast.  \nnot saying to be avoidant intentionally, just dont reciprocate their shower of validation if u dont feel like it.  \nhopefully they can grow into something more, and earn your trust .  \nneuroscience./ growth mentality. make it a process
1	ENFP in love with an ENFJ, advice?	Fellow NFs of reddit!\nENFP here, I've fallen pretty damn hard for a close ENFJ friend. I really hope this is the right subreddit to give advice. We've been friends since our freshman year of college, but only started hanging out with great frequency this year. I know he likes talking to me, he sits with me at meals, texts me about his feelings, or to wish me a happy birthday or merry christmas, he always invites me to movie nights, and asks my opinion on things. Are all ENFJS like this with everyone? Or do I have a shot? Also, will an ENFJ make the first move? Or should I just go for it?
3	Probably likes you. Go for it. 
3	You're right to think that ENFJs can come across as flirtatious. We are very friendly. However, if you're in to him, I would suggest you tell him. Better to be open about how you feel if you can no longer bear being platonic.\n\nKeep in mind, ENFJs usually speak up if they're interested, but not always. We can play it close to the chest if we feel our interest is, well, not interested. That said, always guard your heart. I would let him know how you feel, but be prepared for a chance of being disappointed. The optimist in me wants to say he totally digs you. The caution in me says he's a nice guy who thinks you're great, but it may not be anything beyond that. \n\nHope that helps! Good luck.  :)
2	Go for it I say.\n\nMany ENFJs are like that with everyone, but I think you do have a shot.\n\nENFP and ENFJ are the same real-world type, so are very compatible.
6	ENFJ's which personality types did you have the best relationships with?	I'm trying to gauge if there's a common personality trait ENFJ's look out for. \n\nDoes one personality trait instantly lead to a long term relationship? \n\nDoes another cause instant red flags to go up and not continue with the relationship? \n\nWhich MBTI's did you have the best and most meaningful relationships with? I'm just searching for a trend better grasp this myself. 
8	19F ENFJ/P-T\n\nINFJs make the longest relationships. Many upside downs. Most of the time it’s because ENFJ needs energy from people while INFJ needs space. If you need “a person” I wouldn’t go to them but they turn out to be mine... this is where\n\nINFPs and ENFPs comes in. INFP makes the easiest friends and if you have them you have a good support system. I love having deep conversation with them. There’s never a dull moment with INFPs and while they tell you the absolute truths they done it in a way that won’t make you want to punch them in the face.. \n\nESFJ make the best people when you just want to have fun. From my experience, they are not much for deep heart to heart talks but they are great companions when you want to go on adventures. They are social butterflies! \n\nAnd... just \nStay away from ESTPs yikes (but I might be biased.) 
4	My ENFJ gf answering.\n\n"Best relationships are an ENTJ and an INTP.  ENTJ is emotionally supportive and INTP provides new perspectives." \n\n"Worst relationship was with an ISTX. He didn't communicate his emotions and was insecure and distrustful." \n\nSo I can guess the reason she likes the INTP(me) and the ENTJ is because we're  able to communicate about whatever we're thinking.
3	I get along well with INFPs and have lots of INFP friends.
4	I only two of the MBTIs of guys I've dated but they were two pretty big ones. \n\nINFP - still the one I miss to this day. the "biggest" thing in my life. It was all fairytale young love romance. very cheesy and corny and even tho I hatedddd those things, I loved them bc it was from him. he's the only person I get emotional over. brought so much laughter and made me learn about myself and go outside my comfort zone in a lot of ways but in ways that made me feel safe and okay. sometimes a little too aloof for me but something that can be worked on. always made me feel secure and treated me like a princess. I know its bad but I do seek out qualities of him. \n\nISTJ - now this one was a "big" one after ^INFP up there. which he had big shoes to fill. and he did the job! for a while. he was truly logical but also had a goofy side but also was just too stubborn on some things and always felt like there was a wall up that kept us at a distance. we didnt "fight" but when we disagreed, we kinda both failed to be the same afterwards. As much as we did sometimes click, there were definitely too many differences that I didnt see a future with him unlike INFP.\n\n(a note not to be taken to this type but the ISTJ actually ended up ghosting me and then out of nowhere confessed he was still talking to his ex the entire time and she gave him a second chance to which he dumped me and then came running back when she left him again bc he said I was fun lolzzz)\n\nI wish I knew more of the men I dated but, for the ones I can kinda place, I am better with ones who had either N or F, and INFP was one of the only introverted types I assumed I had been with that I was able to meet common ground with when it came to basic E vs. I things
2	ENTJ for romantic relationships. Always basically lol
2	I tend to get along best with NFs and NTs.  I'm pretty sure my best friend is an ISFP though and she's lovely.\n\nNTs are really great at looking at things from a different perspective (from myself) while also communicating clearly. As someone who begins most sentences with 'I feel', a little more logic and reason is always welcome. As for NFs, almost from the outset I feel as though we are family, there's just this instant 'I get you' that happens. \n\nCurrent partner is an INFJ and I can't see our relationship ending.
1	Never been in a relationship but I feel like ENFJ, INFJ, ENFP, and INTP would work best for me.
1	I wonder how many of these types were unhealthy? Like do enfjs think a particular type is annoying even  if the person has a healthy mindset?
1	Married, male, ENFJ (28) here: Stable relationships for me would work well with INFJs and ISFJs (my wife is one)... INFPs and ISFPs might work too but those are very passionate (infatuation) and sensual, so no long-term material.
1	I tend to have a special appreciation for ESTPs ESFPs ESFJs and ENFJs. Something about them resonates with me \n\nI have literally never ended up liking an ESTJ. Not a single one of my ESTJ friendships or professional relationships have worked out. I just can’t stand how *these particular* ESTJs tend to disregard other people the way that they do. Just be nice pls
5	Difficulty in confessing your feelings?	Have any other of you ENFJs struggled with confessing your feelings to a crush? I am a 20 year old male ENFJ in college and for me it is difficult with this one girl. She's an INFP by the way.\n\nHer and I met last year and were in the same friend group and she opened up to me about difficulties between her and her roommate, her loneliess, anxiety, and noisy mind. I was there for her and things really got dramatic in our friend group after her and her roommate had huge fights and divided up the group, mostly because of her to be honest. \n\nBut since the fall, her and I have been so close, silly, and affectionate with one another. I have to admit, I've had feelings for her since last year but suppressed them and told myself she was too much for me. However I caught feelings hard in the fall and really believe she is my first love. I was sick to my stomach thinking about her, would always smile like an idiot every time I saw her, I could go on forever.\n\nI'm worried about confessing to her for a few reasons\n1. In case she doesn't feel the same way, I'm worried she thinks we still can't be friends. Right now she has a few other friends but this summer, we're gonna be in class this summer and she really doesn't have anyone but me. I don't want her to feel like she has to be alone because her feelings weren't reciprocated.\n\n2. I feel like she's too good for me. She is way too pretty, smart, talented, and athletic. She has told me a hundred times about how much I mean to her, how great I am, how I'm so talented, how everyone I meet seems to love me, etc. But it just seems hard for me to think all of that is good enough.\n\n3. I'm worried that if we do get into a relationship, I'll feel like I'm not meeting her standards or something. Every time I see a guy that she hooked up with, I get upset because I'm just worried she'll cheat on me or something because she's cheated twice in the past. Honestly, she's changed a lot and hasn't been with anyone for a bit over 6 months now and has reassured me that she has a good head on her shoulders. But that insecurity is still there.\n\nI know this was a long post but I just wanted to provide some details so there is a proper understanding.\n\nEDIT: Also in confessing, any tips on how to go about doing it? Should there be a "moment" or should I just ask her to hang out and just tell her then?
7	In my opinion, finding a deep connection with someone and having your feelings reciprocated is not easy - people may date a whole bunch but a true, deep connection is rare. Having strong feelings for someone and not putting yourself out there/ not letting them know is a mistake. Yes, you may get rejected. But you may also not. Don’t let your insecurities hold you back from even trying. If you don’t try, you can’t expect to find it. If you don’t tell her, you’ll probably regret it and you’ll never know what could’ve been. Take the risk! do it for your own sake. If it doesn’t work out, learn from it - I learned a lot on how to manage my emotions  and depression from rejection and I can honestly say I’ve come out stronger. \n\nYou deserve to be happy, don’t get in your own way. \n\nGood luck :)\n\nEDIT: You’re close friends already, I would just tell her when you’re hanging out one on one. \n\nAlso, remember that just because a particular someone doesn’t have romantic feelings for you, it doesn’t mean no one else will either. If it doesn’t work out with her, don’t let yourself give up on future prospects. 
2	Lol yeah, I’m awful at the whole confession of feelings things. I’ll flirt and stuff but outright confessing my feelings? Na. Maybe I would if I liked someone who I thought I had a really good chance with and didn’t have a ton to lose. However, I think it’d be awful difficult to express my feelings for such a close friend unless my feelings for them were extremely strong and I couldn’t stand keeping it in. Never been in that situation, so not sure exactly how I’d react tbh.
30	I feel like a dozen people all in one.	\n19 Female ENFJ\n\nDoes anyone else feel that they are a different person depending on who they are with?\n\nI feel like I change depending on who I am with, especially when it comes to one on one time with someone. When I am in a group I then grow quiet because I have a hard time being a different person to everyone.\n\nThe motherly me to the younger girls in my life seeking advice and sharing their hearts. \nThe responsible, oldest of four siblings, yet still little girl, me when with my parents. \nThe bossy, mature, loving, yet opinionated older sister to my siblings. \nAnd so many other me-s. \n\nAm I dreadfully insincere? Am I fake? Is it possible I am all of the different versions of me? Or which one is the real me? 
18	Yup I'm a 20 year old ENFJ male in college and I've noticed this about myself as well. When we talk to people, we tend to mimic their mannerisms, quirks, and even emotions. I think it's how people find us likeable but at the same time it is overwhelming with a group of strongly emotional people. Luckily I am the most extroverted usually so I'm initiated conversation and others follow. Just remind yourself of your own habits and emotions. Step out if you need to. \n\nBut don't ever think you're being fake or insincere. You are just able to adapt to people with what you know they need. Take some time to self-reflect and you'll find yourself
11	27 Female ENFJ. \n\nI’ve noticed this in myself as well. Which is why I think it’s really important to consider who you spend your time with and who you want to be.\n\nI also think it’s important to realize that not everyone has to like you. I think we use this chameleon behavior in order to make others feel comfortable and enjoy us. As I’ve looked at this behavior in myself I’ve begun to realize that I don’t need to sacrifice myself to that degree in order for others to feel comfortable and enjoy me. And in fact, being who you are in a very honest and unapologetic way is a gift to other people. More so than just giving them what they want from you. 
7	nah i think it's more of being considerate to the different groups you hang out with. ENFJs are helpers and I believe we are typically more inclined to adapt our personalities to the people we are with.  Different people need different things and we like to provide for their needs.  If you are being insincere or fake, that's more geared towards doing things for selfish reasons.  Example, behaving a certain way to be popular.  That's my take on it\n\nThe core of your beliefs won't change across these different groups.  Just think about it.  If you were to provide a speech about whatever topic, how would you present it across different audiences?  Would you have the same speech in front of kids vs adults? Or even people who are bird enthusiasts or cat people.  You'll change your topic or the way you present your thoughts depending on who's listening.  Does that mean you're being insincere? 
7	This is very much like me, and I used to feel bad about it like "Why am I so quiet arounf Person A but totally cray cray with Person B?". But as ENFJ's are very empathetic, I think we match our energy with who we're with and adapt.
5	I think it's a strength.
4	19F ENFJ. Was actually just talking to my friend about this cause there are times when I find myself saying “I hate the me when I’m with (whoever)” and sometimes two of my friends (who don’t know each other) talks to me at the same time and I feel like I have to switch characters. I know they are both me but... \n\nCurrently finding myself too, you are not alone. 
4	I feel the same exact way. It's so draining
3	That’s absolutely me as well. I’m in college rn and have different friend groups and behave quite differently when with each group \n\nEdit: I’ve wondered all those questions too so it’s nice to know someone else is in the same boat as me :) 
3	Absolutely! I think everyone does a little of this, but maybe it’s more extreme for ENFJs? I forget the exact psychology terminology, but it has something to do with archetypes... kind of like character roles in a story or movie. \n\nWe overplay a certain aspect of our personality and downplay others in order to fit and accommodate a role we feel someone would want us to be. So ENFJ of us... lol. \n\nI’ve done this and do this. It can get tiring. But, my close friends and my family get a better blend of me, so I think that’s good. \n\nIt probably becomes an issue if/when you go to great extremes to separate friends and family because you’re afraid you’ll come off as a wildly different person to one of the groups. Also no bueno if you lose your inner-sense of “self” or compromise core values just to please. \n\nIf you’re looking to feel more grounded or centered about it, take a little time each week to think about all the aspects of “you” and realize it’s all part of your truth. That may help you integrate a little. \n\nIn the end, don’t stress - all the world is a stage anyway!
3	I'm exactly the same and have been throughout high school and college. I could fit in with any group and somehow had a different side of me relate to them better. \n\nHowever, like others in this post mentioned, my personal values and ethics never change. If I have strong oppinions about something, I keep a consistent message regardless of who I'm speaking to you. May be the tone, delivery and choice of words would change, yet the core message is still the same.

7	What makes a person cute in your opinion?	
8	Someone who believes the world is a beautiful place. 
6	Physical cuteness: Big eyes, Rest of facial structures small (or even whole Body structures)\n\nBehavioural cuteness: either shy low-key IxFX or high-key stereotypical ENFP pixie\n\nRelating to female cuteness btw\n\n(Just realized this was meant for ENFJs to answer, well nvm)
7	A good heart, happy disposition. Takes care of themselves and is kind to others. \n\nFuck looks. 
7	I'm an INFP and I have a soft spot for sweethearts. That's why I joined this group.
2	Someone that can light up a room and be fun. 
17	Do ENFJ's ever get scrambly/scatterbrained around their crush?	I've seen someone who has tested as an ENFJ in a Not very often but regular setting, we have incredible personal chemistry and I feel like this person is attracted to me but I know ENFJ's are known to be very friendly to everyone. One thing that has changed is that before we started talking lots in person when said ENFJ was speaking they were very orderly with what they were saying and thought arrangement etc. but last time I seen this person they were totally scrambly and smiley and giggly and going off on tangents and not even finishing some thoughts which stood out to me quite a bit. I thought it was adorable, btw. But just a question I had to hopefully be able to tell more clearly the dynamic between us. 
15	As an ENFJ male, I can say that this person likes you. I act the same way around my crush in the sense of the giggling and randomness. I do keep my space organized however; mostly because it feels more welcoming. But after realizing how comfortable someone can be if there space is a bit scattered, makes me feel like that’s a good way to let someone know you’re comfortable with them :)
10	ENFJ woman here: I once went to hand over a very organized, very time-sensitive and important pile of papers to a guy I had a crush on at work, and...suddenly found that my already questionable motor skills had gone to total shit. The papers, which I’d spent so long getting into meticulous order, slipped from my hands like a greased football and flew *all over* his desk. Oh, and then I tripped over the rug on my way out, because I wasn’t already embarrassed enough. \n\nSo, yeah. We get scrambly and scattered (and in my case, spazzy) for sure, and I definitely think it sounds like she’s into you. Good luck! 
10	I think them being giggly and smiley is a good sign. I find that I do that usually around someone I really like. Also, the fact that they go on random tangents with you is generally a sign that they feel comfortable revealing their 'randomness' to you. So, I'd say there are some good signs in there.
6	19F ENFJ here, can confirm :)) that’s so cute btw \n\nI wouldn’t say that giggly thing happens only with people that I *like*, it happens a lot with people that makes me comfortable and excited and happy. It’s a good sign, dw. 
6	ENFJ here. I can confirm, when I have a huge crush on someone, it's almost like I forget the english language. Or how to human. I get so giggly and smiley and I literally can't talk. It's actually really funny and I definitely come off as very goofy. 
4	ENFJ female here - can definitely confirm sudden lack of orderliness likely due to happy crush-like feelings.  My closest male friends all think of me as... uhm... goofy.  But everyone else perceives me as more orderly, as you say.  \n\n(I usually keep those "random tangents" unspoken, unless I'm testing out whether or not my new crush is cool with my 'true' excited, multi-linear thought process... lol, or if I already trust that they are, then it's just me less restrained.) -* what /u/sushi-n-sunshine said* 
3	Yes all the time!
3	I have a strange feeling that you are an INFP.
3	[ENFJ female] I get so mad at myself when I do this.\n\nIt's like I forget how to be me and then anything my crush says or does has me melting like a chocolate chip on a hot day. 
3	I wish I was that hot around my crushes. Instead, I just look like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzXWxvjQE9s
2	yes they do
2	A better question might be Do ENFJs ever NOT get scatterbrained around their crush lol. 34 ENFJ and I still can't even much of the time.. 
1	Fuck yes. One time Cat Strut came on in the store so I asked her to dance and afterward I had to hide my hands shaking lol. Didn't help that I hadn't eaten that day but still. 
2	How do you feel about well-roundedness in personality and the striving towards that end?	I am a male INFP, although if any people in my personal life understood typology they would describe me as not so much, that. Long story short I've been around the block in my short 24 years, I dropped out of high school and hung out with druggies and gang people, never really got directly involved but was around a lot of bad stuff which deeply affected me. Later on when U wasn't around that and moved to a different city I was the victim of 2 separate armed robberies, first at knife point then at gunpoint the second time, both of which were under a month apart and very aggressive and brutal. I was diagnosed PTSD and tried to get away from the store I was working at where these incidents took place. My good friend is a cook at a fancy fine dining restaurant in my city, she said they would be needing a new dishwasher as the main guy was leaving, and silly me thought that would be easy. It turned out to be the most stressful, strict, harsh, conflict-oriented environment I've ever been in. I always tried my best, and had a lot of people like me and thought I was fast and efficient and after every shift I'd have people buying me drinks at the bar a block away. Struggling through this PTSD and literally being fed alcohol on a regular basis and having to function in such a confrontational environment day in and day out turned me into kind of a douchebag. I'd recommend watching the video for the song "Animal I Have Become" by Three Days Grace for a visual representation of what I was like. After almost a year, it was finally too much and I gave my notice and got in touch with my previous employer and asked if he had any positions available at a different location as he owns a few in the city. He did, so I went there and have been there for almost a year, it is more of a fast-food type environment and I was made a manager almost immediately because of my previous experience at the other location and the discipline I learned at the restaurant. It was hard at first, supervising stoner kids that don't care and the constant turnover, bad customers and the overall lack of glamor of working in fast food but for the last year I've learned a ton about true leadership and being confident at what I am doing and sticking with the calls I am making and dealing with unhappy customers. Overall compared to about 5 years ago when I literally had no job experience and sat in my room listening to music and watching YouTube, I have been described as "confident", "extroverted" (of all things) and been told that I can truly lead people. Anyways, basically all this long-winded rambling has come down to me realizing I am waaay more well-rounded than I ever thought I could be, confident but not cocky  (hopefully not anyway lol) and organized and punctual and not a pushover anymore like I used to be. In my own opinion, typology is not something people should use an excuse for a lack of self-development ie. "I'm an introvert so I'm not good at talking to people and by some logic, I'm not even gonna try to get better at it" in my opinion I feel like it should be used as a tool to determine one's own strengths and weakness and aiming to live by strengthening such weaknesses while simultaneously playing to one's own strengths. I'm not looking for a particular "type" in romance, I'm looking for someone who is trying to develop themselves as much as possible, just like I try to do. Although, I do have a thing for you guys because as far as my own observations go, you're typically more inclined to be the way that I am describing and I am hoping that by rambling like this that it can resonate with at least someone. Thank you for your time to read this if you actually got to the end. Hope you have a great day/night/whatever. 
4	Hey there, hate to be that guy,but do you mind splitting this up into multiple paragraphs? It’s easier for us to read so we can really help you
3	Loved this: \n“I’m looking for someone that is trying to develop themselves as much as possible just like I’m trying to.”\n\nI like what you said about not being bounded to typography. As someone who’s learning psychology (and an ENFJ), I find myself spending way too much energy trying to analyze the people around me. It was a bit unhealthy at times because I started assuming things about people based on what I’ve read.\n\nNow I’m starting to hold myself back and just focus on getting to know the people without the typography and by doing that, I started really focus on how my interaction affects each person. And therefore I am able to work on MY own traits and better myself instead of trying to fix and save everyone. \n\nThe intention is not to change myself for others but to change the aspects of myself that are causing strains in my relationship and create harmony. \n\nBut I think It’s also so important to realize that there are parts of my personality that just is. That’s not to say that I haven’t been learning to compromise with the world aha. (I’m just really talking about my emotional baggages but... spring is here, it’s time to for spring cleaning :)) \n\nThanks for sharing your story!  
3	Fe-Se loop ?	Have you been able to recognize some instances of a Fe-Se loop in yourself ? How did it manifest ? How do you overcome it ?\n\nI just saw a post over at r/mbti that talked about loops and it made me want to ask !
5	Hey!  I still have these sometimes but I used to have them a lot more.\n\nI'd get like in a state of denial about something and that's usually what would spawn it.  It super sucks, I go like completely derpmode whenever it happens.\n\nWhenever I want something REALLY bad, like bad enough to alter my perception of reality completely I bring this kind of hell on myself.  Funny enough, it seems to come from shutting off one of my mbti functions.  Like if my intuition's screaming at me to do something and I really don't want to do it, it just ditches me and leaves me stuck in a loop.\n\nMy Ni and Ti definitely seem pretty teamed up, because if they run out on me I find myself becoming very bad at rationalizing my way through situations.  Oh also I turn into the world's worst driver when this happens and if I'm in a mood like this will usually ask someone else to do it.\n\nIf my Fe gets shut off, that also seems pretty connected to my sensory awareness.  It's not always too destructive but it's usually a bit frightening and bewildering to experience.\n\nTo get over my loops I just have to look at whatever is causing me to deny my situation and accept it.  This is a little harder when it's the Ni that runs out the door because it's kind of hard to chase down and get back.  If my Ni runs away usually I have to introvert for a while for it to come back.\n\nNow that I think about it when my Fe runs out the door usually the best remedy is peopletime, which kind of fits neatly into the whole logical framework of this mbti stuff.
7	Asking an ENFJ Out and Niceness	How should I go about asking an ENFJ out? I'm socially inexperienced and don't want to look like a creep. Also, how do I know if an ENFJ is being honest or just trying to be nice?﻿
5	First question... just be honest, kind, and straight-forward. \n\nYour second question... that's a hard one. Usually the people closest to me can tell but most others would never be able to guess. 
2	I suggest you be as honest and open as possible. INFPs and ENFJs want the same things in life because of the NF. The difference is how we go about getting them.
2	Tbh, it isn’t that difficult to tell the difference between me being nice and honest. If I find someone repulsive, boring, etc, then I’ll act relatively uninterested and certainly not go out of my way to talk to them or anything. However, if I’m being really friendly, talking to you a lot, initiating conversations, etc, then I really like you (can be platonically or romantically). Now, how to tell whether I like you romantically or just as a friend? You don’t. I’m sorry, but it’s nearly impossible to figure out my intentions. I probably act like I’m hitting on my guy friends 24/7 but it’s not my intention haha oops.\n\nBe straightforward, though. Get to know the ENFJ a bit and ask them out, straightaway. I love people being straightforward with me and would seriously admire your confidence for asking me out.
13	ENFJ male?	In terms of compatibility I’ve read that ENFJ females love ENFJ males and, as an ENFJ female, I’m interested to see how/why that may be true! \n\nAny male ENFJs out there?! 
12	It's probably because of emotional compatibility. You're constantly building each other up, and sensing/asking if everything is alright. Both are understanding, and communicate very well. Simple keys to a good relationship.
9	Here! Marry me? \n\n;P
8	ENFJ Male. I normally attract introverts for some reason. 
15	Hi, male ENFJ here. Most ENFJ dudes I know are typically confused for being gay, but that's just kinda a fact we've accepted. 
2	My brother and gf are ENFJ. My gf thinks my brother is a giant douchebag.
2	I can't definitively say I've met too many male ENFJs. I think I knew one--we actually had a crush on each other--but that's it.\n\nMale ENFPs, though. Christ! I seem to be a magnet for them. \n\n
2	Mm-hmm. When and where are we going to dinner? ;)
1	Types are usually most compatible with someone who is Opposite-Same-Either-Opposite, so as a general rule of thumb you would be most compatible with infps and intps
1	I have an ENFJ female friend who adores me. \nI love her as a friend. \n\nI couldn't imagine being in a relationship with her though. She would drive me up the wall. 
1	Yup me! 
1	Have an ENFJ male friend who I love being friends with. But dating him? No thanks. He’s an awesome person, but I just don’t feel like that’s something that would ever work out haha.
6	Why do I do This?	I'm an INTP, and I thought this would be the best subreddit to ask. Why do I do this, and what emotion is it?\n\nI'll come across something with personal significance such as lucid dreaming. Then, it'll go mainstream one day, and SO many people will be spreading awareness of it and getting recognition for it. I'll turn into a 5 year old using emotional reasoning or underdeveloped logical reasoning. "Noh! I did dat! I did dat first! Nuh-uh! Iz not twue! You don't deserve that recognition and glory! I deserve to be the one to share this special thing with people! I discovered it! Iz not fair!"\n\nI know I didn't do it first, but it has personal significance to me or I have emotional attachment to it, and I think that's somehow related.\n\nThe closest thing I can think of that it might be is pitiful envy or jealousy..maybe it IS envy or jealousy? I don't know. I'm great at self-analysis until it comes to my emotions.
6	Sounds like an ego trip. You basically crave validation and affirmation for things you believe you need credit for. It's definitely a bit of emotional immaturity. You probably don't have that internal validation, which is a sign of insecurity and why you seek praise from others
1	This sounds so much like an Enneagram type 4w5, or possibly 5w4, please look it up.\n\nType 4s are predisposed to wanting to feel significant, special, different.
26	Another friendly reminder from an ENFP	
2	INFP needs advice on a lost friendship with an eNFJ :(	Hi guys! I'm an INFP that needs advice on a past friendship I had with an ENFJ. Sorry if this gets long, I will try to keep it as short as I can. \n\nOkay, I first met "Amy" when I moved to my new city for school and started my new restaurant job. She was the bartender there and I was a server. We became fast friends, we just clicked so well. We later became roommates - BEST living situation I ever had. we never had any issues, never got into any fights. before moving in with each other we were friends for about a year. Amy honestly was the best friend I always wanted. I really felt like we understood each other so well and I felt like she really cared for me more like family than a friend. I'm very introverted and shy, she dragged me out of it and introduced me to all of her friends which made me feel welcomed, as this was a new city to me. We were always together 24/7. We both would say we were basically soulmates, which I truly believe even to this day. I never met anyone who I felt 100% myself. I just really loved her and I know she loved me too. So I was going to school full time, working 5 days a week, working at an internship, social life, and had a bf. She only worked as a bartender full time. I was pretty busy at this time in my life, which I don't think she understood how much stress I was under. One day we got in a fight at work because she said I never made any time for her and our other friends. I got defensive and said I'm just really busy. A few hours later when I got home I texted her a huge text apologizing saying I realize I haven't been making any time to hang out, I'm just really busy, but I will work on it and I'm sorry if I haven't been around. she never texted me back. A couple of days later I fly out of the state for a mini vacation and then come back like a week later. we hadn't talked at all. basically, we ignore each other for like two months. During this time she made 2 new friends at work that she basically replaces me with. We are both extremely avoidant when it comes to problems and confrontation. At work she becomes really aggressive to me and starts posting really petty stuff about me on fb (it didn't actually say my name but it was so obvious it was about me). I had seen her be aggressive to other people but I never thought she would direct it at me, so I became even more avoidant which kind of snowballs into a bigger issue. this entire situation gave me a LOT of anxiety as I didnt know how to confront her. she eventually tells me shes moving out with her boyfriend, we kind of talk about what happened with us and we apologize. Later we get into another fight because I wasn't there to move the couch, she got really nasty with me, even though I moved EVERYTHING else out and deep cleaned the apartment. I struggle with this because, even though I didnt act perfect, she really started becoming aggressive towards me at work and online. I found the way she acted was really immature and caused me so much anxiety.\n\nnow I realize we both didn't act like adults, I should have confronted her right away instead of sending her a text. Or I should have confronted her when I came back from my vacation instead of avoiding her. I know I hurt her feelings since I wasn't around as much, I think she felt I was paying more attention to my bf which is fair. but she also hurt my feelings. It was all around a shit show. \n\nIts been a year now since this all happened and I still think about it all the time. I've never been good at making friends so I think this really affected me. we had a great friendship and with one fight it all disintegrated. I dont know if I should just move on or if I should make an attempt to reach out to her? I dont know. any advice?\n\nIf you read this thank you!\n\n\n
3	Move on. Once we get to that stage, there’s no coming back. 
2	Honestly your ex-friend seems to be very aggressive to you. If it’s been a year already and it ended that badly, I personally would let it go. If you really miss the friendship and truly believe your life would be better with her in it again, then you could try contacting her, but I wouldn’t count on it working out. I’m sorry how things ended, that really sucks.
2	Friendships like that are never healthy in my view, sorry. I don’t think MBTI types are relevant here.\n\nIt sounds like you were both TOO dependent on each other. Codependent. To a point where she demands your attention? And to a point where you still want to be friends despite her aggression? She’s been showing you “hell no” over and over again.
2	Yeah I kind of get the feeling that ENFJ's are a bit high maintenance? Like you can't just leave them for a few weeks and come back, they will be really hurt by that. I have no idea, I only have NT friends. (I'm ENTJ)
6	Big 5 Correlations on MBTI subreddits (x-post from r/INFJ)	Edit*\n\n##[Results Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/89k2lv/big_5_correlations_results/)\n\n-------\n\nHey there, ISFJs! I'm a mod over on r/INFJ and we've been doing this experiment to see if there are any Big 5 correlations between MBTI types. So far I've got input from INFJs and ENTPs, and it's going so well that I wanted to ask you all next (I've also asked the INFPs and ISJFs just today, too)! I promise to come back with results if I get enough people to participate :) Just state your type and your % scores for each Big 5 category (and feel free to add anything else from your results if you want to share). Thanks in advance!\n\n-------\n\nThere is a lot of talk regarding MBTI vs [the Big 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) - [is MBTI as valid](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/08/02/what-is-the-current-thinking-about-myers-briggs), do they correlate ([1](https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/13460/what-correlation-research-has-been-done-on-mbti-vs-big5), [2](https://personalityjunkie.com/09/openness-myers-briggs-mbti-intuition-big-five-iq-correlations/)), etc. I thought a community post would be a good way to see what kind of distribution we have when we compile INFJ results. With enough participants, I'll report back the distributions and see what shakes out :)\n\n##[You can take the Big 5 test here](https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test)\n\n(it's free, the $29 "cost" refers to the cost of their premium report, and you also don't need to create an account to see your results, just click "no thanks")\n\n**Please comment here with your type (let me know your type so we're not mixing results) and the percentages for each Big 5 category.**\n\nBelow is an overview of the Big 5 for those who are unfamiliar.\n\n-----\n\n[*From wikipedia:*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits)\n\n> * **Openness** to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)  \nAppreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity and a preference for novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine. High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus, and more likely to engage in risky behaviour or drug taking. Also, individuals that have high openness tend to lean towards being artists or writers in regards to being creative and appreciate the significance of the intellectual and artistic pursuits. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven—sometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor.\n\n>* **Conscientiousness** (efficient/organized vs. easy-going/careless)  \nA tendency to be organized and dependable, show self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior. High conscientiousness is often perceived as stubbornness and obsession. Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability.\n\n>* **Extraversion** (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)  \nEnergy, positive emotions, surgency, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extraversion is often perceived as attention-seeking, and domineering. Low extraversion causes a reserved, reflective personality, which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed. Extroverted people tend to be more dominant in social settings, opposed to introverted people who may act more shy and reserved in this setting.\n\n>* **Agreeableness** (friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/detached)  \nA tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and whether a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentativeness or untrustworthiness.\n\n>* **Neuroticism** (sensitive/nervous vs. secure/confident)  \nNeuroticism identifies certain people who are more prone to psychological stress. The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, "emotional stability". A high stability manifests itself as a stable and calm personality, but can be seen as uninspiring and unconcerned. A low stability expresses as a reactive and excitable personality, often very dynamic individuals, but they can be perceived as unstable or insecure. It has also been researched that individuals with higher levels of tested neuroticism, tend to have worse psychological well being.\n\n[*From a peer-reviewed paper:*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886996000335):\n\n>The NEO-PI Agreeableness score was correlated only with the thinking-feeling (T-F) dimension; the NEO-PI Conscientiousness score was correlated with both thinking-feeling and judging-perceiving (J-P) dimension; the NEO-PI Extraversion score was strongly correlated with the extraversion-introversion (E-I) dimensions, while the Neuroticism score from the NEO-PI was not related to any MBTI subscale score. The openness dimension was correlated with all four especially sensing-intuitive.
2	ENFJ. Openess - 96%. Conscientiousness - 77%. Agreeableness - 86%. Extraversion - 85%. Neuroticism - 12.5%. 
2	Your score for openness was high, at 94%.\n\nYour score for conscientiousness was low, at 42%.\n\nYour score for Extraversion was high, at 83%.\n\nYour score for Agreeableness was high, at 83%.\n\nYour score for Neuroticism was low, at 41%.\n\n\n\nI got Empathic Idealist first, then Practical caretaker and analytical thinker almost equal and then almost none of Logical mechanic.\n\n\nI'm really artistic and always eager to learn something new so high opennes makes sense. I feel like it relates to conscientiousness because I can't say no to stuff like going out or doing things (Hey there Fe-Se loop). \nHigh extraversion cause yeah I love meeting people, learning about them etc. \nHigh agreeableness which means I always put other's need before my own (and I can never say no to what they ask me, everything is related yay)\nI feel like my neuroticism could be even lower because I keep quite literally every emotion in.\n\nSo yeah ! Overall I feel like I have pretty standard results for an ENFJ :)

4	ENFJs and waiting for a date	Hello ENFJs :)\n\nIf you Female ENFJs really like a guy, you are pretty sure he likes you to, but he doesn't ask you out, what do you tend to do?\n\n1. Wait\n2. Scrap the whole idea and find someone else\n3. Ask them out\n4. Convince yourself there is some aspect "wrong" with you and try to fix it, thinking that is why he doesn't ask you out.\n5. Other (Comment)\n\nBonus points if you include what type of guys you tend to like or find attractive.
5	I usually tend to lean toward 3. I’m usually making the first moves. But that’s partly because I go for awkward nerdy boys. I think I learned fairly early on that a lot of guys will put up a front of disinterest to seem attractive, which still sometimes comes off as them not finding me attractive. I can only go off of what is in front of me, and there’s no use in me having to constantly assume what the other person wants. If the guy acts that way enough, there’s no use giving my time to someone who doesn’t care about me, so I will usually just ignore them. \n\nIdk, it’s so contextual. But I generally tend to think that someone is not into me if they put no effort into talking to me. If they do and just haven’t asked me out, I’ll make the move. \n\nEdit: and for the record, I’m actually not usually too worried about setting up a date. I like getting to know the person, building a rapport, and feeling them out before throwing all my nervousness into a date. 
3	I kinda hint at the thought of us doing something and then if that doesn't plop the idea in their mind, I usually just will invite them to something (out with friends or just over to hang) or just be like "oh have you been to so and so? I've never been and have wanted to try. we should go sometime"
2	[deleted]
1	My ENTJ partner and I have been together for 6 years. Love at first sight, we chased each other equally aggressively.
1	I'm somewhat in a similar scenario, but with an infp. I really like him and so I told him that. he said he'd rather wait and basically take things slow, which I'm fine with because at least he let me know. \n\nif I really like someone regardless of their type, I'll spend more time with them and text them as often as I could (within reason, as I'm also very busy with my line of work). however, if I can't see the same enthusiasm from their part, I move on.\n\nrecently I've been attracting diplomats (enfp, which is my last ex, also dated another enfp, but I have a feeling he's more infp, and my current date is also infp). they're just so easy to get along with!
1	5. I never feel sure if a guy likes me unless he tells me. Even if other people tell me, he likes me\-\- I don't believe it. I have to hear it from the guy. If he doesn't ask me on a date, I will start to see him as a friend and look elsewhere.\n\nMen I'm attracted to:\n\nBaseline: good hygiene, good manners, takes care of himself, loves & respects his parents\n\n1. Has to at least value me and care to work at marriage because I want to grow old with someone; Potential to  be a great dad and husband\n2. Characteristics \(at least these things\):  compassionate, honest, loyal, respectful, open minded\n3. Communicator: Listens well, tries to get back to people in a timely manner, thinks about his delivery, effective\n4. Has initiative: Positive, decisive, confident, takes action\n5. Has a moral compass\n6. Willing to try new things\n7. works hard, intellectual , cares about self\-improvement and learning\n8. Physcial trait: Preferrably tall \(6 ft. or taller\),  attractive to me
5	(Im)patiently waiting INTJ	Hi ENFJs!\n\nTo be brief, I have been talking to this ENFJ lately. In all honesty, I love everything about her and her life. I also know that she likes me too. However, there are other guys who she likes as well because she tells me about them. I think her dream man is somewhere in Europe and she would probably marry him if she could. Nonetheless, our chemistry between our Ni functions is amazing, and so we're pretty open with each other about our ideas and our life stories which has been wonderful. However, I am really getting to the point where I can't stand hearing about these other guys anymore. I have tried to endure the jealousy and I know this is ultimately not healthy for me. I'm at a point now where I'm just patiently waiting for her to finish her lifelong search for the perfect relationship and realizing that these guys could not love her the way that I (already) do. This is probably not even an MBTI-specific question but I figured I should ask r/ENFJ since I have a lot of respect for your insight and find your advice to be really helpful.\n\nWhat the hell am I doing waiting for her knowing that I am not perfect in her eyes? I want to give her space to figure out what she wants. I want to give up knowing I could never compare to these other guys. But, goddammit, I find myself getting drawn to her every time we talk and I can tell she feels the same way.\n\nIf someone here could either drag me out of this friggin' nightmare or prescribe a nice strategy, I would be truly grateful. Thanks in advance.\n\n[Lucius - Feels Like a Curse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvR-6ok2rFE)
7	Wait, why are you ‘waiting’? Have you even made some moves yet? If she’s anything like me she’ll entice you and charm you and keep you on the brink until you make the First Big Move. Come on! You’re into her, she’s into you, sweep her off her feet! Be direct with your intentions. She’ll let her mind wander to other people so long as you’re not clear with her. \n\n\nWhen I was in the dating scene I literally treated most people as friends because they weren’t direct and didn’t take charge - even if I was attracted and into them their lack of initiative would make me feel more casual about the whole thing, to the point where there was no romantic tension. \n\n\nI can’t give advice unless I know more about what you’ve done so far. Have you asked her out on a date before? Have you kissed her? Have you told her you’re into her?
2	If you haven’t told her anything then you’re not even in the game. Don’t hate on the other players!
1	Well, before I got married, I was definitely on the whimsical side of love, more fantasy than real. Is that an ENFJ tendency? Nonetheless I married the girl that made the first big move, not the "dream girl" I was chasing
1	She's probably focused on her career.  I'd ask her about when she thinks she'd settle down and what she imagines for her future. My dreams for my future are very quiet and simple compared to my present.  She probably can sense you like her, which makes it rude for her to talk about other guys in my opinion. 
1	You do realize....\n\nWait. I'm talking to an INTJ.\n\nWhat you need to realize is sometimes women talk about other men in order to inspire men into acting, or to test their resolve. ENFJ's seem blatant to me, but they also seem to lie a lot to maintain social harmony. Also, women can be shyer than their male counterparts. I read somewhere that ENFJ's have awkward social shyness that crops up during encounters with someone they are really crushing on and not just flirting with. \n\nYou're an INTJ. You need to learn to trust that incredible intuition. So fucking what if her "dream man" is in Europe (I'm assuming you're on another continent.) You're there, now. First of all, have you asked her out?\n\nIf not, what do you have to lose? She's already driving you crazy.\n\nIt's for this reason I truly believe it's incredibly difficult for men and women to be friends together, unless they are in a teacher student relationship of some kind, or family. \n\nIf it ruins your friendship, so what? You'll be relieved the issue is resolved.

9	ENFJ-ENFJ Romance?	I’ve always thought that it’d be awesome to date someone who is so much like me. However, after some more thinking, I’ve realized that I’m not too sure I’d want to date someone who’s just as conflict avoidant, stubborn, and in control as I am. \n\nI still believe that ENFJs make great friends but I feel like an ENFJ-ENFJ relationship would be a constant power struggle regardless of how healthy and mature the two individuals are.\n\nSo, ENFJs, have you ever dated another ENFJ? If so, what was your experience? If you’ve never dated a fellow ENFJ, do you think that you would like to?
3	I personally think as long as you both are willing to put in the work to listen to each other and meet halfway, it'll be ok.
3	I was with another ENFJ, she was a little egotistical and had a weird sense of spirituality to her, but she was very thoughtful and kind. The sex was incredible, but she wanted something more than just the physical aspect of our relationship, which came off clingy to me, so we ended things. She was pretty hurt and pulled some pranks on me, nothing mean or hurtful, but she was upset about the whole thing. I'm in an awesome relationship with an ENFP right now and I truely feel like I'm dating my best friend. 
2	I'm not sure how I would feel about a relationship with another ENFJ. I mean I definitely want someone similar but maybe dating another ENFJ wouldn't be the way to go.. There's definitely pros and cons. The pros are that you know how the other person's mind works so you would be able to keep them happy and if you had to argue you'd know how to do it without upsetting the other person. However there probably wouldn't be much growth for either person in that relationship. I mean there could be but I don't know. I guess it just depends on both people in the relationship. Of course not all ENFJ's are exactly the same. So one healthy one could help a more unhealthy one. I don't know man, there's too many pros and cons. It definitely could work though 
1	Opposites attract. \nOpposites attract. \nOpposites attract. 
7	enfj signs of affection?	Hi hello. I have no idea how many of these has been posted and if this is the 10,000th one my apologies lol. I wanted to start off with that i think a great number of ENFJs tend to be very affectionate and comfortable with hugging/touching and i realize that I'm sure a lot of your actions probably get misinterpreted as romantic affection? How far do you guys show affection with your friends and people you care about?\n\nI have this ENFJ friend and I just don't know what to think with him. We both discussed how much we enjoy physical touch and hugging haha; sometimes he'll just put his leg on top of mine when we're sitting or just affectionately dig his head into me lol. earlier today he held my hand. I feel like to some people it's a no brainer but he really is a very affectionate and kind hearted person. I would ask but i don't want to make it awkward. any personal anecdotes ? :-) i really hate to misinterpret his actions because i have been on the receiving end and it made me feel weird.
3	I do the leg thing,... basically when a pup is affectionate but not cuddling, I do it, too. It isn't my main source, though, since I show my affection more for doing things for others.\nA few months ago, my husband was bummed there were no cookies in the house due to dieting. So I baked him peanut butter cookies (1c pb, 1c sugar, 1 egg, mix, spoon, press with fork, bake 350F 18 min until slightly golden. Total time: 30 min) just because. I figured the oven would heat the house, it's one bowl to wash, and make him happy without leaving to go to the store. :)
2	Alright, are you guys teens or adults? \n\nAt any rate, I did pretty much all of those things when I was in High school, short of holding hands. I even gave my friends leg massages at track.  
2	I mean, yeah, everything besides the hand holding sounds par for the course.\n\nThat might fool around and be flirting.
2	Yeah, I'd say I'm very affectionate. I hug a lot but if it's guy friends I might avoid hand-holding to avoid sending the wrong message. 
1	I'm an adult, and I'm still "touchy" with my closest friends. Something about being touched is extremely comforting to me!
5	Dear ENFJs, can you please explain to me how you use your functions?	Hello everyone, INTP writer clocking in. While I think I have a pretty firm grasp on MBTI and how the types use their functions, I still think it would be useful for me to actually ask people of each type directly. I'd hate to accidentally go into a whole bunch of stereotypes. If anyone could mention lesser discussed traits/behaviors of ENFJs, that would be helpful too. \n\nThanks in advance and many greetings from a person who really appreciates ENFJs.
23	I just have this overwhelming feeling to need to do good. I get stressed out wanting to do good things and help people. I want to know what's going on, what's available to me, and how I can work to make things better. I latch onto problems and spend a great deal of energy thinking/working to fix them. I don't like putting off issues between friends and prefer acting on things quickly to get them resolved. Letting go is NOT a strong suite and I tend to latch really hard to friend's/situations which may be toxic because I want to repair them. This can be anything from jobs to friends, but it's consistent that I want to fix a situation instead of leaving it alone to fester. \n\nIn my ENFJ opinion, one of the best things and worst things about my personality is summed up in one thought: "If I don't, who will?" I will charge the gates of Hell if someone asks me to and spend a great deal of energy planning how to help people. The problem is realizing that some of these people aren't worth charging Hell for and some people aren't worth the time. I kinda describe myself often as the last member of bomb squad to leave the room when trying to fix something, even if being there puts myself at risk of being hurt. \n\nI think that's the lesser-known part of ENFJ or at least one if the more extreme parts. 
17	\nENFJ here. This is my best explanation of us ENFJs. If others disagree please correct me. \n\nShort version:\n\nFe is our main function, and with Ni and Se, this makes us very aware of the people around us and what they are feeling. \nTi is our stress function and we fall into a dark introverted thinking spiral when we are having a hard time sorting our feelings from other people or have been absorbing too much negativity or are going through a stressful anxious time. \n\nLong version: \nI experience sensitivity regarding my own feelings and other people's feelings. \nI soak up the feelings of people around me, like a dry sponge does water. This makes me very attuned and sensitive to what other people feel. Also, if I am soaking up positive emotions, that is pleasant, but in negative atmospheres I can easily fall into dark sadness. \nI am sensitive regarding my own feelings too. I have easily hurt feelings. I take things personally. \nI have a mini crisis sometimes because I cannot divide what I feel from what people around me feel.\nAt times I am feeling sad for no reason because I have simply absorbed someone else's sadness.\nOther times I am happy or sad and feel guilty because people around me are feeling the opposite and I can lose what I feel by then feeling what they are feeling.\nI am just a plain mess of feelings.\nI can read what other people are feeling very well. Because I read what they feel and then absorb it, I can sympathize easily. If they are crying, I naturally join them because I am suddenly feeling sad too. I will feel everything with you. Like a chameloeon— you are red, I am red. You are glad so I am glad. \nSometimes, I must admit, avoiding certain people when I know they are in a negative state of some kind, because I want to keep my positive state and I don't want their negative emotions. \n\n
7	I actually really hate negativity. I feed off of other people’s emotions, so to me, emotions move very fluid. When someone acts out wrongly or negatively, I’ll either react in a calming matter because I want to fix the problem, or impulsively because they’ve pushed it too far. Maybe we’re just impulsive in general, especially when we’ve thought of great ideas and immediately want to make it happen! Majority of the time though, I would want to solve the problem, instead of making it worse and more dramatic. \n\nI’m also a really great listener, and will validate the speaker (but not when I know they’re a narcissist lol) by asking lots of questions in order to go deeper into the conversation, or reacting towards what they’ve expressed to me. I do give people their own personal space too. Like, if I know they don’t feel like talking, I would be respectful and try to not make them feel uncomfortable. We’re really great with social cues and reading people/vibes of the environment. I love talking to people, but I value peace and harmony more. Though, I can be drained from too much human interactions as well lol. Heck, other extroverts drain my energy out! Lol! I’m definitely not always happy, bubbly, or cheerful around people. But, I do try my best to hide it (super unhealthy). My assumption to being drained is because I want everyone to feel validated, at peace, happy, well-respected, etc, which can all lead to a loss of genuine energy due to self-overwhelming of my own emotions (like feeling 100-0 real quick). \n\nWe honestly just want harmony and love. Although we know there is “evil” in this world/life, we choose to be one of the good people who still have hopes. I know it’s not logical to think about the good in everyone, but my intuition of human beings are deep, and it is rooted in my Fe to understand everyone’s story and/or perspectives  as a person. 
6	Validation?	Hey guys. Do you compliment people a lot? Or encourage them?\n\nAnd how do you feel when others compliment you? Or when they don't? \n\nI'm just wondering if ENFJ's are more prone to insecurities compared to other types... 
13	I give compliments only when I mean them, and I thank people when I am complimented (unless I find their compliment too flattering/ disingenuous).\n\nENFJs are not prone to insecurities; people are. The further I am into MBTI, the less I find it to be any indicator of human behaviour.
4	Funny you posted it, I have been thinking about validation recently.\n\nI caught myself complementing people a lot, but I am also easily impressed. Recently, my compliments are aimed towards more visible stuff (outfit, makeup, choice of the hair colour). I believe that if I can make someone happy, I will, why not. Friends and colleagues who identify as ENFJs seem to like encouraging people as well. It costs me nothing to make an effort, but it may make somebody's day.\n\nBy far, my ideas lean towards realizing that there are two categories of validation - compliments of the visible/tangible totems, or recognizing people for their deeds or personality traits. Where is the line and when is what? Who knows :p
4	I'm always known for my positivity and it's a personal motto "if you like something, say something." So, if I notice anything about a person, I tell them.\nI don't think too much about other people complimenting me, but I am always insecure about my looks before anything social.
3	I absolutely compliment and encourage people a lot. It's my MO, and I think it's an ENFJ MO in general. \n\nI also love being complimented. When I'm not complimented, I don't feel anything in particular--but I might feel a bit neglected if my husband goes a long time without paying me any compliments. Still, I think that has to do more with love languages (I'm words, and he's not) than MBTI.\n\nEveryone can be insecure.
3	It comes naturally to me to say something nice about someone, whether it is superficial (physical appearance/clothes) or a quality that they possess. I don't mind if others don't compliment me, unless I feel it is deserved (an action that deserves credit or I feel particularly pretty one day :P).
1	All of you go watch Boston Legal now	The main character Alan Shore is the most ENFJ character ever\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zluIU7iAzr0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=qd5vRphPqnk\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5yBlYxOnnU\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miiRQVmo-VM\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4la8Izrwea8\n\n[Bonus Denny Crane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzmrZWe_9eg)

8	Enfj girls, where do you go to meet guys?	Pretty much just the title.\n\nEdit : figured maybe I should be more specific, I am an infp male. I like going out though and like people. Alcohol helps with breaking loose a bit.
10	Anywhere. Grocery store lines, dog parks, waiting rooms, bars, sidewalks, etc. I always hear “it’s hard to go anywhere with you because you stop and talk to everyone!” 
6	Dance class! Or musical theatre etc. Look for the enthusiastic person who doesn’t care so much for gossip.\nI should clarify, I’m a female ENFJ dating a male INTJ at the moment, and we had to meet several times over 5 months (dance class, walking to class at university, studying nearby in a public space, me finding any opportunity to be in his general vicinity), then organising “study dates” for a couple of weeks before going on an actual coffee date, and even that was awkward but I was still interested and made the first move and now we have been dating for nearly 2 years!\nBut yeah, I think having some sort of prior connection is important; all of my exes were a part of my friend group already, although my current partner was an exception we did get to ‘warm up’ to each other for a few months first.\nAlso, might just be me, but although I do like a drink or two I will actively avoid anyone who is really intoxicated. I just tell people “I dance better sober”. Might also be part of the ENFJ trait of absorbing/reflecting other people’s emotions but I don’t need any alcohol to have fun if the people around me are also having fun, so buying me a drink would never work. If I’m with good friends, I can go clubbing totally sober and have a good time!
4	I'm an ENFJ, female. Except for one ex, everyone else I've dated was someone I was already friends with. I met all my exes in school. High School, undergrad and grad school. The friendship would naturally grow into more, becoming best friends before starting to date. We're everywhere, so a specific place isn't exactly what you should be looking for. Don't be afraid to approach first, ENFJs tend to love meeting new people and enjoy learning about them. We also tend to be warm and friendly. Good luck!
2	Lol, you people are like, everywhere. I met the one I know at a play.
2	Weird places? Here's a list of where I met my SOs/flings:\n\n* On a porch (bonus fact: I met my now-husband randomly in the park below, and then six years later again on a porch)\n* At work\n* On a bus\n* Walking back from getting groceries\n* Another bus\n* At a farmer's market\n* In Japanese class\n* In a park\n* In a friend's band\n* Playing Soul Calibur II\n* In a play\n\nI'm very approachable and will talk to pretty much anyone, so the place doesn't matter. Notably, I don't seem to meet people in bars. I value authenticity and conversation, and it's hard to get to know someone when you're drunk and screaming over the latest shit pop.\n\nSecond bonus fact: My husband is an INTP, and so were many of the SOs in the list. I love you guys! Don't change. Your ENFJ will come your way...as long as you're sure you won't mind her controlling ways ;)
2	The internet. 
1	A haha I can't say I've ever gotten with a dude that I didnt meet on the internet. No particular place is where you're gonna find lots of ENFJ girls at though.
1	bars ha, but honestly id really only talk to someone if I had a common thread/connection to them (if they were with a group of people I knew, etc.).\n\nI met my ex infp at a bar actually
3	Does anyone else feel too self critical?	Hi, I've gotten into the whole MBTI thing a few months ago, and I'm an ENFJ-T. \n\nI know that being self critical is a flaw of us ENFJs, but latelt I've noticed that I'm way too critical of myself, to the point where I think this is turning into severe self deprication. It's not just about owning up to mistakes and trying to improve, or anything like that. I beat myself up endlessly over every small mistake and try to basically force myself to change. I study and practice piano all the time, simply because I get mad at myself if I spend time doing anything else, since I feel like I'm just wasting precious time on nonsense. \n\nI tend to rarely if ever critisize others, since I feel like I'm not a good enough person to have any right to. I honestly believe I'm annoying and a pain around and I just want these feelings to stop.\n\nI hate my piano playing, I hate every single thing about me, I hate my personality, and my appearance. The only thing I really love are my really close friends. I can make friends easily, but always have walls up that very few people have brought down. And the worst thing is that those who I do consider close friends always support me and such, so I start hating myself even more for arguing with them, or making them care/worry about me so I often lie and try to hide anything self-critical. I feel like a mess and just... ugh. I'm sorry for the long post. I don't know why I'm posting this to be honest. Maybe I want to talk to someone who's been where I've been, someone who is where I am, or just want to let this out. If you've come this far, honestly, thank you. Hope you have a great day!
4	Hey man, I don't think this is a thing for ENFJ's but it does sound like a serious problem. The feeling that you're not good enough can lead to some really screwed up sense of self-esteem down the road if it hasn't already. Feeling like a burden on people will only force yourself down and will block yourself from getting help. If there's anything us ENFJ's do best its branching out to people and consoling them, (and this is something I had to face to) but don't forget you are not less important than everyone else. It will help you immensely if you can make more friends, hear their problems and share your own so it's not up to your ears all the time. Maybe it's not the best message to base your confidence by what others say to you, but in the beginning it will really help you build up your confidence so that you can start seeing your own importance in the world\n\nHope this helped!
2	set smaller and more realistic goals. I used to be like that, with a moving goal post, hence never reaching any goals and just perpetually being depressed. Don't do that. Keep positive and make every goal attainable. Celebrate your successes. Don't compare yourself with others but with how you were yesterday. Do something that progresses you one day at a time. 
3	ENFJ's do have fluctuating self-esteem. I don't remember where I read it but they said that ENFJ's have very low self-esteem compared to most other types so there's that. However, it can become a real issue so just reach out to people for help. And I don't mean to just talk about the feelings that are very surface level/easy to talk about like all ENFJ's do. I mean to talk about those feelings that are really deep down and that no one truly knows about. 
12	Let me know how many of you post this to your Facebooks :)	
5	I would never post this on Facebook, it just seems a but too 'holier than thou' at certain points. To each their own though
6	I'm very curious about the creator of this post and what his/her definition of success is. 
4	Successful people don't fall victim to black and white thinking. Or green and red
2	I love this :)
2	Successful people do not criticize, yet this whole thing seems to be criticizing the “unsuccessful” other side. I hate “us versus them” anything. 
2	Eesh never. \n\nSuccessful people do not preach on their personal Facebook. 
3	ENFP here! What do you guys act like when you have a crush on someone? Do you play hard to get or do you talk to them as much as you can?	
13	It’s been a while since I’ve started a crush, but I tend to gently tease the other person according to how much teasing I sense they can stand.\n\nAt the same time, I insert myself into a situation or conversation whenever appropriate, kinda coaxing (for lack of better term) the person into reciprocating. That way I try to get a sense of how much they’re into me, if at all!
4	I do both. 
5	I don't play games when it comes to dating, so if I'm crushing on someone I talk to them a lot but am cautious in case they don't feel the same. I'll keep text conversations going, tease and compliment them a lot and I'll go out of my way to do nice/sweet things when appropriate. 
3	There are a bunch of posts like this recently on this sub, check those out! There are some comments I think you’ll find useful b(^^
4	I want to talk to you.\nI am going to talk to you.\nI like you. *A lot*.\nWhy would I deny myself that which I want?
2	If I am interested, I act interested. I will want to talk, make the first move, ask questions etc. 
2	Same as the others. I’m going to talk to you A LOT and be very inquisitive about what you like and don’t like. I’ll want to know everything about you. I suspect it is fairly transparent when I’m interested... I’m no good at concealing excitement, and I won’t really temper it just to play some sort of game in the beginning stages of dating. Definitely not a hard to get situation, but I likely won’t directly state my affections verbally until I get an emotional feel for how the other person receives me... which requires the aforementioned attention and talking. 
6	What are your friends like?	I’m curious what an ENFJ appreciates in friendship- what kind of qualities do your friends have that you like? Do you know their types?\n\nAlso wondering your relationships with friends.. do you get very close with one or a few, or do you have a lot of less close friends?
14	I tend to connect most with people who are good conversationalists, open up easily, and who I in turn feel like I can talk to about anything. I love people who I can just joke around and be myself with. Unfortunately, I definitely struggle with forming super close bonds with people. I'm one of those people who has a ton of good friends but is no one's "best friend." I've had "best friendships" in the past that were super emotionally intense and have resulted in falling outs. It can feel lonely sometimes but I've come to accept it about myself and embrace the fact that I'm good at forming lots of different connections and am not a "cliquey" sort of person. I love meeting new people and am welcoming towards pretty much anyone who wants to be my friend!
9	I love people are who are original and don’t apologize for who they are. It doesn’t mean that I’ll like you if you’re a dick but the little kooky and idiosyncrasies that make one fun to be around \n\nEdit: I prefer having a few close friends but have a large social circle 
5	I always think i want someone who is E and would share the craziness of Es, but in all honesty all my best friends are Is. Two of my exs are INFPs, didnt work out well.. My 3 best friends are: INFP, ISFJ and INTJ. To me as an ENFJ what repels me if snobby people - I really appreciate empathy and openness, deep conversations about life. What I have found out - i have really love-hate relationship with ESFPs, love them a lot, but when they are too much I start to get really edgy. Don't know why.. 
3	My best friends are ENFJs and ENFPs. I appreciate that we can understand each others constant want to be around other people. I like honesty and genuine conversations that can be fun or deep.  My husband is an INFP. I like that he's more calm and appreciates his alone time or his alone time with me. I think I'm mostly drawn to NF types for the most part rather than ST.
3	Short version: ENFJ female here! I have a large social circle, but I have few close friends.\n\nLong version:\n\nMy parents, brother and two sisters are some of my closest friends. They know me through and through and still love me and vice versa. I feel safe with them. \nMy mom is an INFP, and that is just a classic pairing— ENFJ and INFP. Our NF ties us together by our very souls. \nMy sisters are ISFP and ESFP, and gosh they are so fun and they bring out the fun in me. They make me laugh more than anyone else. They bring the spice to "sugar and spice and everything nice".\nMy brother is an ISTJ and he is so practical. Tue kind of person that sees how I have my laptop and cords arranged at my desk, and in minutes has it reaaranged to work better and even look better. I don't even notice that kind of stuff. He does. \nMy dad is an ESTJ and if I tell him a dream or an idea, he can pick it apart in seconds. He will find all the errors and I sometimes cry. Buuuut really, in the end, he can make my dream or idea and make a it into an actually possibility. He takes it from an idea or dream, and turns it into a plan. \nThese are my ride or die. \n\nBut that's family— I sometimes need a friend who I am not related to in any way shape or form. \nI have a female ISFJ friend who is many years older than me but we just get eachother so well probably thanks to our Fe in common. We talk feelings and dreams and ideas and thoughts and it always feels good. \nI also have a male ISTJ friend and I can tell him anything and he takes it in stride. He helps me to chill out when I am anything but chill. He is reassuring when I need reassurance. I can vent to him and he doesn't mind. I love how steady he is. How dependable he is. I need that in my life.\nMy adopted grandma is an INFJ so we get along soooo well. I have told her the good, the bad, and the ugly and she is so wise, loving and good to me. I go to her for advice and help and she is always there for me.\nI have countless friends but these are my squad. 
3	ENFJ female here! I like friends who are authentic, honest with me, understanding, and kind. I love it when my friends trust me and confide in me/ask for advice. I also definitely value a good sense of humor in my friends. Also people that I can have deep conversations with. Man I love my deep conversations.\n\nI’d definitely prefer having a small circle of close friends over many friends if I had to choose. However, I do have a few close friends and a lot of casual friends at the moment, so it’s a win-win. I’m also always open to meeting new people and making new friends. I love to meet new people! \n\nOne of my best friends is a fellow ENFJ. Dang, I’ve never in my life met someone who is so much like me. Extremely similar personalities, similar interests, the whole deal. I don’t think I’ve ever met someone who understands me like he does; we definitely “get” each other. We always say that it’s spooky how much alike we are! \n\nI also have a close INFJ and ISFJ friends. INFJ is the only other person that gets me similarly to how ENFJ does. I know that I can tell her anything and she won’t judge me for it. She’s also super funny and a great person in general.\n\nISFJ is really nice and a great friend but doesn’t take crap from anyone. I really admire her for it. While I have my head in my Ni idealizing land, ISFJ stays logical and never idealizes people or situations. Since all my friends are intuitives, she’s the only person that will tell me the hard truth about someone or something in my life that I need to get rid of. She’s also always up to go pretty much anywhere, and we have a ton of fun together. \n\nI also have another ENFJ friend, a few INTP friends, and a few friends whose types I’m unsure of.
2	i don't know their mbti's except for my last long-term relationship--he's an ENFP. we're both into music, play instruments, and get along well in mosh pits. we're still very good friends and multiplayer companions.\n\nmy other friends are a mixed bag. i'd say most of them are into the same scene as me (electronic music) and love outdoor festivals. they're the ones with the most open minds and hearts. we love being weird together.\n\nthere's a few that i'd classify as still my close friends even though we don't see each other as much. i met them by working with them in past jobs. i still love occasionally hanging out with them for those quieter nights with board games and wine, or brunch. we love these intimate hangouts, so i guess they are a reflection of my need for introverted relationships.
2	All of my closest friends are Is: My husband is INTP, my best friend is INFJ, and others are INTJ and ISFJ. It sounds reductive, but sometimes I really need someone to just listen to me. I feel and think a lot, and I have a lot to say about it! While I like the energy of other ENXXs, we end up talking past each other, not *with* each other. It makes me feel loved to be really listened to and *seen.*\n\nIn general, I value authentic, passionate individuals who care about improving the world and helping others. I'm weird and silly, so I also like people who enjoy a sense of playfulness in life. People who seem to thrive on using or hurting others are the worst to me! I don't understand how anyone can deliberately make anyone's life worse. Life is hard enough; what pathetic impulse impels them to add to that?\n\nI prefer having fewer relationships that I invest myself in deeply. As others have said, it's hard for me to find close friends, so I hang onto them. For as open, gregarious, and supportive as I am, I truly don't understand why it's been hard for me to find friends in life. It seems like these qualities actually drive people away at times, which seems odd to me, but whatevs. Haters gon hate.\n\n
2	I don't have a best friend which makes me sad but I have alot of close friends.
25	Borderline I?	Anyone else feel like ENFJ's are the most introverted extroverts? What I mean is that enfj's are great with other people and love getting their energy from them, but at the same time feel extremely comfortable alone?\nFor example, being invited to a party and knowing you'd have fun there, but don't want to because you would have more fun by yourself?\n\nLet me know what you think, maybe I have the wrong idea of introversion and extraversion
12	Haha, hate to be that guy, but that's a pretty broad description that I think everyone can relate to. Don't get me wrong, you nailed the idea of I vs. E, it's just your example seems like it applies to everyone.
9	I have said before that ENFJs tend to be more introverted than most extroverts but I got a lot of downvotes for that. There is debate which extroverts are most introverted but ENFJs in my opinion are in the top three at least. 
7	I call myself a high-functioning introvert. I can put on a great front and talk to anyone, socialise etc. etc. but it wears me down after a while & I crave my own company so much more.
8	Yup I need as much time alone as I do with people 
3	Same! I’m an only child, so I’ve always assumed that’s where my introverted tendencies came from. 
3	Yes, I'm very socially introverted. I hate parties and prefer small groups where everyone knows each other.\n\nE vs I was originally supposed to mean orientation of attention, but everyone started using it to mean social orientation.
2	I agree wholeheartedly. 
2	Explain "more fun by yourself". Doing what exactly?\n\nI ask because between 16 and 25 I didn't go out a lot, BUT I played a lot in my computer with other people, interacting by chat or voicechat (teamspeak) a lot. So, for normal people I was an introvert, but I really liked gaming because of the teamplay.
2	I can definitely relate to this! I've questioned whether or not I'm an extrovert a lot because I was quite shy when I was young (probably more related to low self-esteem than actual introversion) and I get very burnt out on socializing when I have absolutely no time at all to myself, particularly on big group vacations or if I'm socializing multiple weeknights in a row (weekends are usually fair game because they feel less rushed). I truly do crave alone time to recharge after situations like this. However, I DO NOT enjoy spending entire days at home doing my own thing, which I feel like disqualifies me as an introvert. Unless I have work or chores I need to get done, I always feel down and drained after a few hours of "me time" and am itching to talk to someone or get out of the house.
4	I feel the same way 
1	Agree completely. I think it also depends on the setting of spending time with people. I don’t enjoy trying to converse with people in bars or in passing because they’re not really conversation settings. Some of my friends are surprised when I tell them I don’t feel like going out but quality time with a handful of friends and some wine is my type of night
1	I just made a similar post on /r/entp \nIt's funny because  by boyfriend is an enfj and I think our extroversion and introversion are well matched. He was pretty enthusiastic at the beginning of our relationship that I would help him with his getting lost in the maelstrom of parties and I have to say I've been pretty successful. I'm actually feeling slightly guilty that he doesn't even want to leave the flat anymore half the time.
1	Yupppppppppppppppp
1	Same. Realized that Ambiversion is thing and I can identify as that in most cases.
1	I believe that applies more to ENxx's than just to ENFJs.
1	Oh yes, I can relate. For my entire life, I’ve identified as an introvert. However, recently I’ve realized that I’m definitely more ENFJ than INFJ. I love socializing, meeting people, doing stuff with friends, etc. I’m definitely a “doer” and if I’m not going out of the house and doing things every few days, I’ll become restless and frustrated. However, I’m also an only child so I’ve learned to entertain myself and be somewhat content with being alone. I used to suffer with social anxiety and self-confidence too which is another reason why I probably had mistaken myself for an introvert. Even now, I certainly don’t identify as an extrovert. In fact, if I told some close family members that I think I’m an extrovert, they’d probably laugh. I’m definitely extroverted in the sense that I get my energy from others and would rather be with friends than alone. However, I’m definitely still a very high-energy introvert or low-energy extrovert. In terms of mbti, though, I’ve established that I prefer Fe over Ni and Se over Ti which is why I now identify as an ENFJ.
1	I have read a great description, I believe on humanmetrics.com, that ENFJs are truly ambiverts. Ambiverts being both/equally introverted and extroverted.
1	I need a lot of social stimulation and then I need a small amount of alone time. Maybe even a few hours at home to shower, eat, watch something or when I'm driving alone for an hour. Then I feel recharged. 
1	I relate to this, too! While I enjoy putting myself out in the world, I get to the point where it's like NO MORE and I need to hang out by myself. I'm also perfectly content to spend days on my own (like when I was home sick with a flu recently) as long as I have my husband to chat with when he gets home from work. \n\nStill, I know I'm ultimately an E. For example, during my MFA in fiction grad program, I slowly realized that I preferred teaching to writing. I always leave a classroom feeling happier and more energized than when I came in, even if it was a tough class. When I had to sit down to write, I often felt lonely and isolated, like I was missing out on important things happening in the word. I'd choose teaching over writing every time.\n\n
1	I used to think the same thing, but I doubt now that it really means much, since I think it happens to everyone.
5	I can't recognize an ENFJ	I don't think the stereotype is too common (charismatic leader, complete life devoted to people). Can't find a video that's helpful either. \n\nHow's the average ENFJ? \n\nWhat interests you?\n\nHow are you different from ENFJ and ENFP?\n\nHow structured is your room? \n\nDo you care about your appearance a lot? \n\nCheers. 
12	I'm not a charismatic leader, nor do I devote my entire life to people.  Who a person is varies based on the individual.  What makes us ENFJs is how we process and react to things in life.  \n\nI can't speak for everyone, but what interests me in terms of hobbies is video games, traveling, food and such.  I am interested in people and their behaviors and how interactions work.  Difference between the J and the P is that one is more decisive than the other.  It's a lot to do with cognitive functions.  My room is fairly messy, I know where things are even though it's far from organized.  I don't really care about my appearance.  I favor comfort over looks any day.\n\nYou'll definitely get varied answers for these questions because of obvious reasons.  MBTI is not a one size fits all.
7	\nI only know two ENFJs, myself and my dad, and the major things we have in common are relentless optimism and a sometimes very unhealthy devotion to help other people.\n\nMy interests change like every two weeks... mostly artistic and nerdy stuff though. I recently realized that I have trouble learning or doing things for their own sake. Like if I watch a show, I need to talk about it with someone, or I only started going to the gym when I found someone to go with me. I'm unable to do something that's only truly for myself and that sucks.\n\nI feel like compared to the ENFPs I know I'm a lot less... emotional ? Not in a "pfft you puny humans and your emotions" but like, I never get visibly affected by stuff, I barely ever cry, I'm never really mad or anything. \n\nI'd say my room can get messy but nothing too bad. My "J" side manifests itself through a lot of overthinking in every decision I make and being unable to do something if I don't have every potential consequence anticipated before. It sounds like a very unemotional way to act, but it's mainly just me overthinking how my actions could affect others and me wondering "oh no what if I mess up and they get hurt and they hate me oh no"\n\nI do care about appearance quite a lot, but I've never been really feminine and only started taking care of myself like 3 years ago so I'm really clueless and mostly fail trying to look good. I do go to the gym, take extensive care of my hair, skin and wardrobe and wear makeup.
6	I can answer these from my own perspective (definitely an ENFJ, I test strongly for that type on all occasions haha)\n\nIn my free time, I like reading, writing, the outdoors (fishing, walking around, or exploring in general), exercise (especially running), and anything with friends (including the aforementioned activities).\n\nI like to have a very structured schedule and stick to timelines because I find it inherently satisfying and will get frustrated if I don't, which I think differentiates me from ENFPs. I think you meant ENTJs for the first part of your question (right??) so I'd say I differ from them in that I'm very emotional. Surprisingly, I'm not as good with words as I wish I was and I sometimes feel like I struggle telling my friends how much they really mean to me and why (probably just a personal trait of mine), but I definitely am eager to express compliments and give others feedback, and when it comes to my decision-making, I always put feelings (especially others') first. Sometimes this sucks because if someone does something that could hurt me, like if a potential relationship goes south, I ALWAYS jump the conclusion that it was my fault, that I did something to hurt them or make them change their minds, even if later looking back on the situation, my logic comes into play and I realize it wasn't.\n\nMy room is very structured (although I sometimes have a bit of a messy desk because I always have so much schoolwork/responsibilities going on haha).\n\nI care about my appearance somewhere... I'd say in the middle of the spectrum. I think it's really shallow to judge your opinion of others on appearance, so I often remind myself of that and don't waste too much time on things. However, I am actually really self-conscious about my appearance and I also realize that it does have some impact on how you're treated (especially professionally - I'm a college student) so I make at least a bit of effort. For example, I'm a female and usually don't wear any makeup aside from covering up acne (ugh!) and a tiny bit of eyeliner, plus light eyebrow penciling bc I have grossly sparse eyebrows. I try to make an effort to dress at least semi-decently unless I'm going to the gym at college, in which case I aim for comfy clothes to wear before/after, prioritizing my physical health (i.e. gym activity) over how I appear.\n\nI can't say much about if this reflects the "average" ENFJ (though I think my decision-making process and orientation towards incorporating others into my daily activities definitely are consistent with the type) but maybe this helps you understand what one ENFJ is like!\n\nSorry for the rant haha!!
4	My interests are medicine, art, music, travel, food, film, writing, and video editing. My room is always clean and I would say I care about my appearance quite a bit. I think that has to do with the fact that I was a chubby kid from middle school to high school but after getting into shape, I’ve changed up my clothing style, and worked to be the best version of myself. \n\nThis has a huge affect on my confidence so I have to feel like I look good to be my best self. Otherwise I’m quiet, avoiding eye contact, and self-conscious. \n\nI consider myself to be a great communicator and I would say I have a lot of friends because of my energetic and optimistic attitude. I pride myself on consoling people and being able to mimic people’s state of mind and empathize with their side of things even if it conflicts with my values - I believe this is what has led to the best relationships for me
3	I’m very interested in feeling like my life is in order, be it my room, job or finances. My circle of xbox friends is a result of my networking across different friend groups. Im characterized as a cute son of a bitch, and tend to smother my friends a bit. Overall I decide what I want, make a plan to get said thing and then go for it with too much gusto. Im that guy who looks like he has his shit together and knows it. 
3	My room is like death until I know someone’s coming over/I live with someone else, then you’d think I was super neat. I don’t care that much about my appearance compared to most people, but I always dress nicely/shower/brush teeth/hygiene etc. Lots of things interest me but it can be hard for people to gage what I’m most into because enfjs tend to mirror a lot at first, until I know someone for a long time it can feel like I’m a different person depending on who I’m with. It’s like unintentionally being a bit of a chameleon, and I’m not lying about what I like or anything, I’ll just forget to mention anything the person isn’t super into or like not act in ways that are disagreeable to the people around me.
2	>How's the average ENFJ?\n\nDon't know any and I'm not an average ENFJ.\n\n>What interests you?\n\nI used to be really interested in science, mathematics, computers, some craft type things (especially origami), foreign languages, music, etc. There was very little that I didn't find at least slightly interesting.\n\nFor the past several years I've felt much more apathetic; I wonder if it's all the psych meds I've been on?\n\n>How are you different from ENFJ and ENFP?\n\nYou mean how are they different from each other? I think ENFJs are like a saner, more rational, calmer ^*coughsuperiorcough* ENFP.\n\nDo you mean how am I different from the typical ENFP/ENFJ? I would say I have slightly better Thinking because I used to be really good at mathematics, physics, etc. I'm also less emotional.\n\n>How structured is your room?\n\nMessy but I know exactly where everything is (unless someone moves it).\n\n>Do you care about your appearance a lot?\n\nNo, very little. Sometimes I don't even comb my hair. I do make sure my clothes aren't a bad color combination.\n\nBy the way, there's no way you're an INTP. I'm seeing INFx, maybe INFJ. Extremely common mistake.\n\nEdit: wording
2	I think it's most helpful to pit ENFJ against other similar types.\n\nENFP: WOOOO let's have a party! Who wants drinks? Do you need a drink? Let me make you a drink! Aw, going home already? It's only 2am!!!!!!! And it's no nice when we can all be together. Isn't togetherness the best? You're the best, did you know that? I believe in you SO much.\n\nESFJ: WOOOO let's have a party! I'm making you all drinks I saw off this pinterest post because mint is in right now. Ew, don't put grapefruit with that. Aw, going home already? PARTY POOPER. But no really, LOVE YOU CALL ME. \n\nENFJ: Oh hey, there's a party! I'd really like to go but I have so much work to do... ehhh one night won't kill me. Hey, thanks for the drink! Hm, maybe I should get going? Oh but I'm having this great conversation and isn't togetherness the best? Aw, you think I'm the best? No YOU'RE the best, and YOU'RE GOING TO FUCKING DO GREAT THINGS SO BELIEVE IN YOURSELF!!!!! I believe in you SO much.\n\nSomething like this. Or basically I turn into an ENFP when drunk. \n\n\n
1	ENFJ/ENTJ Cusp\n\n**How's the average ENFJ?**\n\nI'm quite confident, overly ambitious and constantly active. I don't think I've ever been bored in my life. \n\n**What interests you?**\n\n* Playing guitar\n* Going out with friends and having multiple social circles (more than 10)\n* Outdoor workouts like cross fit, calisthenics, swimming, running, cycling etc.\n* Hobbyist programming like game design, building apps, etc.\n* binge watching tv shows that make you think\n\n**How are you different from ENFJ and ENFP?**\n\nCan't say I can spot that personality type. I'd say i'm not much of a free spirit, I live to please others and in service to others. Only recently have I started living for myself, doing things on my own terms. May be its part of growing up. \n\n**How structured is your room?** \n\nVery organised, though there is the occasional t-shirt I have hanging over a chair. Otherwise I clean it every day. \n\n**Do you care about your appearance a lot?**\n\nYes very metro / fashion conscious. Trendy haircuts, fitted t-shirts and skinny jeans. Even fashionable when going to the gym. I shave before I go out even if its for groceries. \n\nHowever 2-3 years ago, i was the exact opposite and never cared for what I wear. Stayed indoors a lot and binged netflix or play a lot of video games. 
4	Jeffree Star an ENFJ?	I follow many YouTubers and I like trying to type them, however I can't seem to find Jeffree's type anywhere online. Based on his opinions and ways of dealing with stuff/situations/drama, and to some extent his way of acting/talking, I think he's an ENFJ. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? 
5	I think he's seriously unstable and not really able to be typed due to that. 
3	my wife is a fan. When I read this post to her she responded “duh” lmao
1	Yes ahaha I thought so too. As well as pewdiepie, another famous YouTuber. 
57	ENFP here. Friendly reminder that you don’t have to have your shit together all the time, it’s okay to depend on others when you need to, and it’s okay to go crazy sometimes. You don’t have to do everything yourself, and nobody will judge you for asking for help. They’ll actually appreciate it.	
15	Posting this is such an ENFP thing to do. You guys are just heartwarming. I think the INFPs and INTPs could really use some of this love right now, too. Those subs can get a little too existential crisis-ey, sometimes. 
14	Needed this today, thank you.
5	I love all the ENFPs in my life, you guys are the best
4	ENFPs are the best. Thank you for this lovely post. 
3	I try to remind my ENFJ husband of this from time to time. I swear getting him to let me help him do anything is like pulling teeth. 
3	thanks
2	I’m an INTP, my best friend is ENFJ. I recently told her some dark stuff about myself and I don’t think she handled it well. I think her keeping this secret for me and worrying about me all the time will drive her insane, and I already feel like she’s distancing herself from me a little. Maybe she’s even scared of me now? Idk but ever since I told her, I feel like she’s been more distant. What can I do to reestablish our relationship? 
1	This is something I learned from an INFP girl I’ve been seeing for a while now. Ever since I realized that I could lean on people and let my thoughts out, it has made me feel so much better about things. I just never wanted to burden anyone from it but I realized that people do want to help and will feel grateful that they could do so. Thank you
1	Thank you, I appreciate this post so much; being strung thin all the time keeps me from seeing even the simplest of truths.
1	I also needed this. Thank you!! 
9	Boundaries	Do other ENFJs struggle with boundaries too?\n\nHow do you try to do better about boundaries?\n\nEdit: Meaning not having boundaries for other people to respect you. I say yes to everything and everyone. I don't set up boundaries for myself for others to respect. 
12	When I was 19 I was in some legal trouble for not being able to say no. I got this wonderful advice from a detective: “it’s okay to give someone the shirt on your back, but it’s also okay to ask why first”
8	Emotional boundaries are a major difficulty for me. \n\nI get close to people. I talk to people about the worst of the worst and the best of the best. Sharing everything possible, you know?\n\nYou have to talk about boundaries. That's going to be difficult depending on the person. You have to establish what's okay, what you're okay with, and how you're going to carry forward. 
5	no. i typically discuss boundaries with my friends/others and we say whats ok and not ok.  This is important in maintaining proper relationships with your loved ones.  Work on it by respecting people and when they say they don't appreciate something you do, stop doing it.  Key word is respect.
3	I have had this struggle at work, but as of late I’ve been learning to say “no”. Mostly because I refuse to live under the weight of pleasing everyone all the time. Fuck, that, I need to take care of me too!!!
3	Still struggling with this... I aim to please and often times find myself just doing what makes everyone else happy. I'm trying to remember "when you say yes to someone, make sure you're not saying no to yourself" 
2	I used to.. But as you say so wisley - it is about boundaries, not about the yes/no. I tend now to do the emotional necessity of the situation. I am happy to help, but only if I cant see any other way around it. Hard thing is to set up boundaries when it comes to emotional support. I have great difficulties with living my own life and not others drama...

8	Which subtype of ENFJ are you? Intuitive or Feeling?	ENFJ subtypes:\n\n**ENFJ-Fe** - The feeling subtype is internally very emotional, but usually modest and restrained in expression of his feelings. Unobtrusive in conversation, tries to behave according to the rules of good tone and manners. Vulnerable and easily takes offense. In his heart and soul he often experiences dramatic emotions, but around strangers hides and tries to control them. It is difficult for him to truly relax, inside he is tense and high-strung, vulnerable and quite self-loving. Has a lot of insecurities, from which he usually suffers but tries not to show this. Outwardly can be proud and unapproachable. - [**Full description**](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/4845-ENFj-EIE-Subtypes)    \n     \n**ENFJ-Ni** - The intuitive subtypes makes an impression of a serious, active, sociable person. An original, unpredictable, creative personality. Sociable, inquisitive and communicable. Quite emotional, vulnerable, and impressionable. Internally tense, experiences frequent doubts and oscillations, due to which can be unpredictable in his actions. At times can be hot tempered and sharp in his statements. Very artistic, emotionally uninhibited, easily and freely expresses how he feels. Well perceptive of the moods of others and skillfully directs them. Knows how to speak with emotion and inspiration, sometimes even pathos. - [**Full description**](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/4845-ENFj-EIE-Subtypes)
1	Where do you take this test? I have always thought that I was just -A
1	Definitely Ni 
1	Definitely Fe, I have very deep feelings and will express them to really close friends if I feel like I need to vent but otherwise I don't let them out a lot (unless they're more on the positive side of things on some occasions). The "quite self-loving" piece isn't me but the part about having a lot of insecurities (which actually seems to contradict this??) definitely is.
1	The FE article is such an eerily accurate description of myself, its creepy...
2	Curious ENTP	Hey guys and girls, this is an ENTP. I was just curious as to what you think of ENTPs from possible past experience or what you know about them. Listing pros and cons within ENTPs that you may have past experience with would be helpful, thanks!
2	I actually dated an ENTP, I usually gravite towards them. I love them because I can have really stimulating conversations and it's a lot of fun to be around them. The ones I've met were very down to earth, honest and sincere which is awesome ! Here are some pros and cons I can think of:\n\nPros:\n\n-Really interesting debates and discussions that don't feel like talking to a wall but to an intelligent person with loooooots of opinions (they often had differing point of views on stuff and were able to back it up, I love it)\n\n-They were really honest, I never had any doubts about what they thought of me, they didn't play games or anything. When I was wrong or doing something wrong, they called me out on it in a respectful way which I appreciate.\n\n-They're so easy to be with, it's always fun and you don't have to think too much. I found I could really easily be myself around them.\n\n-I'm actually still really good friends with the one I dated, they were really mature about it which is awesome.\n\nCons:\n\n-Soooooooooo stubborn sometimes. It's like they get stuck in this "I'm right you're wrong" mindset and NOTHING can get them out.\n\n-They're really hyper and intense a lot of time, but they could get super lazy on important stuff and that was really frustrating.\n\n-One of them was more guilty of this. He was always taking the easy road to everything, always trying to find loopholes rather than work for things even though he was so smart and capable, and that always got him into trouble. \n\n-They always judged the world based on their own perception of it, like if they didn't like something then that thing sucked. At least you could argue about it and maybe with a bit of hope change their mind about it but yeah. \n\nSo there you have it, I love my ENTPs ! Probably among my favourite types to hang out with.
1	Are you anythin like [this person?](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/80g9dn/am_i_really_an_entp/) I know an ENTP chick who sounds like she could have actually written this and I am so glad my friend isn't going out with her. 
1	ENTPs are my favorite type ever. They are all kinds of grumpy fun. 
12	How often do we cry?	ENFJ here and I’ve been a very stoic person all my life. I try very hard to not show vulnerability and therefore crying is a very hard thing for me to do. \n\nToday I cried 3 times :(  I lost a very valuable, sentimental item and after checking everywhere countless times I gave up and started crying. \n\nI have never felt so vulnerable in my life and I don’t know how to ask for help cuz I’m the one who usually helps people. Currently talking to an INFP to see if it helps \n\nI was wondering if other ENFJs are like this
7	I find it hard to cry in front of others if it's about something that is actually upsetting me. I'd rather brush it off as something that's minor. But bottling in your sadness isn't a good coping strategy. Over the years I've found so much comfort in my SO who is an INFP and an amazing listener. Find a person you trust and open up, be vulnerable and let someone take care of you for once.
5	I cry very rarely, although I'd say that's because overall I am a very upbeat and calm person, but also quite a Stoic as you mentioned. I've shed tears of happiness before, pretty much everytime one of my 6 children were born. I'll likely cry when the seventh and onward come into this world. \n\nI don't feel sad that often overall, usually when I do feel sad it's because I feel I have failed to do my best for someone I really care about. I am able to pull myself out of such moods fairly easily with a bit of time, communication, and reflection. I share a lot of these traits with my father. \n\n
3	I’m a male ENFJ and I used to cry often from the ages of 11-18. But that was mostly because of my family circumstances where I had no control over the conflict between my parents and too many things were changing all at once. But for the past year, I’ve rarely ever cried but I think it’s only because I’ve grown stronger from it all
4	I’m a 19 year old ENFJ and I cry a whole lot ahaha. Like listening to music and day dreaming can lead me to crying and feeling an immense amount of emotions. I don’t mind though, it makes me feel very human. 
3	I love to cry. I don’t cry often because I’m overly optimistic and I’ll be like, there are some advantages to breaking a leg (or whatever challenges there are). But when there is something that is sad I embrace it and allow myself to feel what I feel and to honor it. Crying is a wonderful way to express and release feelings. I am a man also by the way as men aren’t supposed to cry but screw that and social norms in general.  So, yes I cry when I feel it and it will be good for me.  If you can cry I’d say go for it and just observe what hose feelings you are having are and where it takes you. 
2	I very hardly cry usually because in general I’m pretty happy and upbeat. Although I do get quite stressed sometimes, I usually try to be optimistic and push through it. It’s been months and months since I’ve cried. Even when I do cry, I never ugly cry for hours or anything, I just shed a few tears for a few minutes and then be done with it.
2	Considering how totes emosh us ENFJs are, I think I cry pretty rarely. The last time I cried was maybe like, 3 months ago? It'll usually come when I've been holding back for a few days/weeks and something eventually tips me over the edge. That said, I am SUCH A CRY BABY when it comes to movies and I think that's probably down to a very empathetic nature. \n\nAlso, I can't deal w crying in front of people. Hard pass.
1	I don't cry often. I usually end up crying if I've been under a lot of stress.
20	I'm having a rough time	Hey guys, ENFJ here. \nI know we aren't usually the type to open up and take any kind of help but I want to kind of express myself a little. \nIn this past month, I've had some really rough times. Lack of friends, lots of deaths, people throwing me away, lack of company and mass loneliness and above all my medication to help anxiety and depression seems to be failing. \nI don't know why I'm posting this, I just wanted to open up I guess.
7	Sometimes it takes a telescope to realize the stars still shine. Hang in there buddy! Good things are coming your way
6	Do you have anything to do on a daily basis that is meaningful?
4	I feeel you. Losing the people, and as a consequence, feeling lost, is one of the worst feelings ever. The best advice I could ever give anyone: know that you will always have you. Your life can completely change, every person and surrounding can be different, but you will always have and be yourself. Focus on yourself, even if it's hard. Do things you love, improve yourself, work on how you work things through. Because even if everything is lost, you will always have that.
3	Who said we don’t love opening up. It’s one my greater joys to open up to people.  The fact you’re reaching out in someway shows that you’re trying to get over it. Just stay honest (to everyone and yourself) and you’ll be better far before you’d expect it! 🤗
2	Thanks for sharing, I had a feeling loneliness might be an issue with ENFJ's but I think they have a hard time talking about themselves and caring about themselves when they need it. That is not something I have a problem with as an ENTJ, I always put myself first, because then I always have plenty of energy to use to protect my friends or support them.\n\nSo, my best advice is to put yourself first until you start feeling better. I guess ENFJ's like to take care of others but you can't do that if you're not okay. 
1	Keep pushing forward. Things may seem dire now, but that just means you have greater room for improvement. Shake things up. Try new things. Focus on you. Stay positive and keep fighting. You'll do great!
2	Why are you here on reddit today?	
6	Its what I do everyday automatically. To pass time. To occupy myself on the phone, etc. it’s totally without substance. It’s just a time sink that I’m addicted to.
3	I wait tables and it sucks the extroverted energy right out of me. Reddit allows me a way to get social stimulation without having to actually do anything. And is better than using facebook IMO. 
2	I usually go on reddit to get my daily dose of news about everything that I follow. mostly politics and music and random subreddits to kill time 
1	I like games and this provides me with the opportunity to discuss them at any point.\n\nAlso reddit provides me with interesting things to think about sometimes. 
1	I like laughing, so check out new posts on r/disneyvacation and r/greentext often.
1	I’m procrastinating and stressed beyond belief. I need a distraction.
1	Just found out I'm an ENFJ. Past tests showed me being an ENTJ but maybe my maturity brought out more of an F over T trait in me. 
3	ENFJ's and Sexual Assault?	Do you guys have any tips for a non ENFJ in dealing with an ENFJ who's been put through this?
5	If you are trying to help someone who has been through a sexual assault the best advice is to help them with finding a qualified therapist. Unless you are professionally trained there is only so much you can do.
1	How we handle being sexually assaulted?
1	Do you like clubbing?	Where can I find ENFJs?
3	Actually I do, but not in any club though. It has to have my kind of people and music that I like. I usually don't go that often, especially not lately. 
2	Not really. Only in a certain state of mind which comes around once in 6 months or so. It's a bit too strange, the environment is very intrusive and domineering. I don't enjoy that.
1	When inebriated, yes. And if the music and fast and dancy enough. 
1	I prefer the more buzzy bars to begin with. Loads of friends/family, somewhere to sit and chat and drink, good music. Then once I'm like, 7/10 in terms of drunkness, move on to a club. You'll find me in the RnB room pretending I'm Beyonce. I'm not mad about it.
1	You can find ENFJs organizing local dance music events. A lot of NFJ/SFJ type of people get involved in the club and rave scene, I find.\n\nYeah, love clubbing :)
5	how do you enfjs deal with problems?	i never see or hear enfjs complaining about there problems?,how do you guys personaly deal with problems?,be it depression,bullying or just any stress?,enfjs always looks happy,and its always others complaining to them?
19	Like you said, "enjfs always look happy". We are VERY good at keeping up appearances, VERY aware of what other people are thinking of us, and VERY capable of redirecting attention. We also tend to suffer through other people's problems as our own, so try not to put that same kind of burden on friends and family.\n\nIf I tell people about my problems they get really worried about me, I think mostly because it came as a surprise to them. If possible I try to handle things on my own, but unfortunately that is not really the best way forward. I guess part of personal growth is being able to handle things like that in healthy ways...
4	To tell the truth, we do complain about our problems, but usually with close friends and family. We are very open on the outside and our natural “leadership” nature sort of forces us to make ourselves look like we’re ok in public so as to not make others upset. 
1	everyone complains about their problems. my friend complains about nearly everything and I do the same. We do it vocally or through chats.  How one processes it varies person to person.  
1	I don’t be really have any, I used to but instead of complaining about them I fixed them. (That being said I’m obviously lucky enough to not have any serious catastrophically bad things happening to me, and I know that not all problems have an easy fix so yeah)\nDepression: I used to have but found being in nature, using birth control(if you get rid of a hormonal thing making you feel like shit all the time you’re gonna feel less like shit) and just calming the fuck down when you don’t like things about yourself and the rest of the things that exist. Body image issues? At least you can do stuff with it, like whistle or skip. Depressed about where my life’s headed/ serious I think I wanna die shit? I just think about how it literally doesn’t matter what I do, so I might as well enjoy it. \nBullying: I was a charter school kid then in middle school BOY DID I GET A SHOCK, everyone was miserable and cared about stuff I didn’t understand yet so I tried so hard to adapt and became friends with all the really popular kids, but then there still wasn’t anything that mattered. Sometime after middle/high school most kids just start hanging out with whoever they want again. \nStress: hahahaHA yeah almost always stressed but in a good way, like sure I’ve got a lot to do but I’m just gonna win at everything is kinda the inner thought process. But I’ve just learned not to get too stressed about anything and just sleep well etc, sometimes helping others with their stress can be really good for your own, it makes you realize how their own stress is more important to them than yours and it’s that way for everyone on the planet so you just fixed a problem, not your own problem but you kind of did the same amount of fixing so who cares anyway. \n\nThis was a clusterfuck and I think I got lost halfway but hope it answers?
9	I think my ENFJ is sad?	I feel very lost. My ENFJ is being distant after being so close.\n\nHe and I worked together this week to put on a huge 2-day project. The week up to it, we were so in sync. I've never met anyone as ambitious and committed as myself, so it was a breath of fresh air and I told him so. He replied that "we are both one in a million!" \n\n\nThe day of the project arrived and he was so different publicly than he is with me but I expected that. He was so bombastic and enthusiastic with the crowds - like, a favorite teacher greeting his students after break. I observed from afar, gave him space and didn't contradict the things he said publicly that were different to what he'd told me. I had given him a personal gift at his house earlier that I'd made just for him. A friend of his came up to me and said, "Oh, you're INTP! ENFJ was so touched by the gift you gave him. Like REALLY touched." I was embarrassed he'd told and shown anyone. (I later overheard him tell this same friend that he'd arranged my station to be close to his on purpose.) ENFJ kept coming by and checking on me and even brought me a drink. Also, he hugs me all the time and hugs NO one else. So he definitely likes me on some level.\n\n\nThe next day, he was a wreck. His whole style of dress and demeanor was different. He told me he'd been up all night and had a few drinks at the afterparty. He was so different that his friend said, "ENFJ your energy is just gone. I can feel it." This produced a strange reaction in ENFJ. He turned on fake persona immediately and told everyone he hadn't been up too late and hadn't drank anything. I didn't contradict him. He pretty much avoided me that day, except one time. He passed by my station and smiled, "Hi, INTP." I smiled back automatically cuz he said my name and i got all gushy inside. Then in a split second, all his thousand shields dropped and the smile on his face became real and touched his eyes and I nearly melted in my seat.\n\n\nThe problem: I sent him a text after the project that thanked him for all his time and energy and I told him he should be proud and I admired him for a job well done. He's disappeared on me. I know he's going through some post-project blues because he basically admitted that publicly. So i sent him an encouraging meme and I eventually got the most pleasant but distant message ever. Do I just leave him be? Do I try to comfort him? Is this distancing normal after overwhelming projects? I just want him to be happy but I don't know how to do that.
12	You might not like what I’m going to say — this is just my view and my view alone. I wonder if other ENFJs can relate.\n\nI have a friend who treats me like a confidante, which I am very thankful for. I know he feels safe with me because I try to be an uplifting and positive friend.\n\nHowever, he would watch me like a hawk, overanalyse my actions, and expect the same cheerfulness from me always. I am exceedingly sensitive to that. He did not know to give me space.\n\nI have issues too. I’m not 100% cheery, motivating, enthusiastic. It’s not *easy* to always be that person. I have down times too. I have times where I want to be alone too. I have times where I don’t want to give a shit about anyone, because in my own downtime, they are still expecting me to give them my all. And if I don’t, they start questioning our relationship.\n\nThat’s what happened with my friend. I disappear when I’m stressed out and anxious. I know he is a jittery person, so I explain it to him nicely. The difficult thing is that he perceives any deviance from my full-on cheerleading personality as me “being distant”, instead of just respecting that I either need space, or someone to take care of me instead.\n\nI don’t know how much of it will resonate with you, but that’s just my 2c.\n\nIf I had any advice, it would be to just live your life and do what you want. You like him? Tell him. You want to know what’s up? Ask. Focus on yourself rather than everything that you think might have gone wrong.
5	Speaking as an ENFJ with an INTP spouse & INTJ best-friend, I like it when either of them notices a significant change in my mood and takes the time to make *eye-contact* and ask, "**Hey, what's up?**" and if that doesn't yield an actual response, to follow up with, "**You seem kind of sad, and I want to know how you are.  So, will you tell me?**"  I've never failed to respond to a genuine inquiry from them...\n\nThat being said, if they weren't so close to me, then I think I'd like something like, "**Hey, you seem kind of sadder than usual.  Are you ok?**" followed with, "***Well, if you ever want to talk about or just hang out to NOT talk about it, let me know.  We could just grab a coffee, take a walk around the block, or play laser-tag or something.***"
2	I have found that ENFJ's will lie for the benefit of their friends, which is fascinating and confusing at the same time to us NT types. I think this ENFJ was definately lying about drinking and stuff, and trying to act cheerful because he gauged it as something that was making people depressed or down. They sound really stretched thin, and at that age they havn't mastered all of their tertiary traits. \n\nIt's really sad, actually, especially when they seem stressed out. I would just be honest with him but that's sort of the ENT solution to everything...\n\nI would say something like...\n\n"ENFJ, I know you are trying to hide it and you are lying to me, but I can tell you are stressed out. For my sake I want you to relax and try not to do anything for anyone but you right now. If there is anything I can do let me know, as that is what I want."\n\nDo ENFJ's get embarrassed when they are caught in these white lies? Are they relieved? I am perplexed by my own situation with one of them. They seem to lie about everything if they think it will help keep things calm and happy. \n\nAs for them showing off your gift, that is really funny. I have noticed that too with the ENFJ I am getting to know. You don't find it amusing?\n\nI'm not used to it but I like it. I think it makes them happy to show off, like it's actually the one selfish thing they do, they like showing off their friendships with people they like to other people they like. \n\n

4	How well do we explain things?	Hello, fellow ENFJs and other interested perusers!\nI have noticed that when I am showing someone how to do something, I readily explain in great detail the steps necessary to complete the task.  \nThis is not the case with my non-ENFJ counterparts.   They may only briefly gloss over what needs to be done or will say “i don’t know” even if it is something that they have recently done.  \nI have a lot of introverted friends, and I was wondering if it has to do with extroversion vs introversion, if it’s something specific to ENFJs, or if it is just my learning style that is different.\nThoughts?
7	I am quite the opposite. I sometimes have trouble articulating my thoughts when I'm explaining things to folks, especially when it's complex. I usually have trouble with breaking it down into small chunks that are easily-understood. I'm working on it, though, because I love to teach people new things!
4	I tend to explain verbally and make a visual as well, as to not confuse what I am saying. Just sayin'(and showin').
3	I usually explain things in great detail and my explanations usually involve a long story to go along with it. :)
2	enfjs im struggling with an enfj	right i know a few enfjs and they are good people but this one enfj guy is just bad,probably a clinical psychopath,what im struggling with is getting to this persons true motives?enfjs are very good at spotting manipulation,this person likes hurt others,and i as an infp am usualy very intuitive tawards people,but enfjs tend to be very had to read,what could possibly this persons motives to hurt others so badly and all the time?
5	He’s a psychopath, we’re not. You’re better off studying psychopaths than trying to attach a type to an abnormal personality and trying to understand why it makes zero sense.
1	I think you're better off distancing yourself from this person instead of trying to figure out their true motives. Nothing good will come out of this for you, imo.
8	ENFJ. Are you guys Silly?	As an INFP I can be pretty silly with the people I know and trust. I was just wondering how is for you guys? Thanks!
16	Extremely silly. We enjoy laughing and making others laugh. 
9	Depends on what kind of friend I'm with, but if I'm with the right person or group of people, I definitely can be. I try to make others laugh when I can (emphasis on "try" lol). Also, a lot of my frustration manifests itself in the form of sarcasm, which isn't necessarily "silly" but definitely contributes to my sense of humor.
9	INTJ speaking about ENFJs here, maybe I am wrong but I think ENFJs are quite the dorks of the world.  \n\nSo is being a dork being silly?
3	The Ministry of Silly Walks was started by an ENFJ. Probably. 
2	yes yes yes.\nI struggle to be "funny" in the sense of making funny jokes. I have a lot more fun (and get a lot more feedback) from being the joke, by being silly, dramatic, using hyperbole, etc.
1	Definitely. :) When I'm around my closest friends, my silly side comes out.
1	Not at all, except when I'm with my ESTP brother
1	I'm a huge fan of Dad Jokes!
1	Maybe, but my humour tends to revolve around *weird* rather than straight up 'silly'. It's mostly done for other people to raise the mood as well and keep things going, so on my own I'll think things but won't do anything silly.\n\nAlso, might not be *totally* representative of ENFJ anymore since I feel like my personality has been changing as of late, but IDK
1	with the right people, as ive gotten older im more confident in being weirder/more silly no matter who i am around but there is just a time and place to everything, ya know?
1	One of my former math teachers is an ENFJ--one if the silliest people I know.
1	I am extremely silly, it's one of my favorite states to be in. I enjoy making others laugh and laughing uncontrollably! 
1	*blows raspberries and acts innocent* Nope, didn't do anything to your chair while you were away. Nope! *skips happily away*\nI love being silly. I'm known at work for having a modified nerf gun that makes everyone within range.\nBest way to get away with something is to act like you didn't do anything when you didn't and your true innocence helps sell the story.
1	If having a collection of various rubber duckies in my office work cabinet is silly, then... yassss....
2	ENFP with ENFJ - Being Shut out / Suppression of emotions	Hi all, I'm 30 yo ENFP dating 23 yo ENFJ. \n\nWe are together for a year. She was muslim when we started dating but that (and the scarf) came off after three months, along with any ties to her family. She's been effectively cast away.\n\nEverything is quite good between us. Except, she seems to have this tendency to suppress the feelings of what has happened. I feel shut out by her, like I don't have access. This creates distance which is painful for both of us.. It also seems this suppression (which isn't a conscious choice of hers I think) is causing her psychological and physical symptoms.\n\nI'm curious what you think is the best way to go about it. My instinct as an ENFP (I suppose) is amongst others to joke and poke and analyze. This seems to help sometimes but can also be painful other times.. \n\nI feel I'm lacking understanding on how to best be there for her in this situation, to support our relationship, and I hope you can offer some helpful insights.\n\nThanks :-)
3	It sounds like she probably has some unresolved trauma, that needs to be addressed. Perhaps you could gently encourage her to see a therapist to process it. It's also possible she may have an avoidant attachment style, so she may struggle with intimacy and commitment. I would say this probably has nothing to do with personality type and everything to do with other factors.
13	The common feeling of being misunderstood	Does anyone experience this a lot in their lives? \n\nI aim to be genuine and transparent, so when I say what I mean, I mean what I say and visa-versa. Some just cannot help but go off on their own idea of what I *could* have meant, rather than what I truly meant. Look, if I wanted to leave it up for subjective interpretation, I would create an art piece. At the very least, we would have it up for discussion with acknowledgments, refining of words and expressions, and eventual agreements on conclusive thoughts.\n\nNaturally curious, as well. For example, I am really into understanding the consciousness, awareness, individual perceptions and social identity theory. On a personal note, I am curious how I project my persona and how others recieve it. Simply asking about how others see/understand me automatically makes the person respond, "You shouldn't care what people think of you; live your life!" \n\n"But I don't *"care"*....I'm just...."\n\n.....*siiiiiiiiiiiiigh*\n\nNot the point. At all. But I'm tired of explaining myself. \n
2	I honestly can’t say I’ve ever felt misunderstood. I’m a pretty straightforward person, I send clear signals. If people misunderstand me on purpose, they aren’t worth it anyway.\n\nIf it’s any solace to you, I think most people would have probably felt misunderstood at some point. You’re not alone. You might also want to read up on Enneagram type 4.
2	Hey, ENFJ here. \n\nI totally feel you! I often feel misunderstood too but to be honest, it's almost always with Perceiving types. I experience that they twist my words and analyze them from their own perception (and not listening to what I'm *actually* saying).\nWhereas other Judging types always want to hear all the details, from every side, before even commenting. They always try to truly understand me and where I'm coming from, before making an assumption. \n\nI guess that's why I prefer other xNxJ's 😅 
1	I'm the exact same way!\n\nSometimes people will be like "well, you said something and it made me think *this*..." hahaha no, I said something and I meant it, not something else!\n\nThat's especially apparent when I try to give someone a compliment. A lot of the time, people will assume I'm making up something to make them feel better. No, maybe I more readily extend praise or compliments than others, but what I say itself isn't a lie.\n\nI'm also interested in how people perceive me. It's weird to think that even though we spend our entire lives trapped in our own bodies and minds, we can never see them from an external perspective.
22	Does anyone else feel the NEED to share?	Whether it's a movie I watched, someone I tutored, a party, or really anything interesting, it doesn't feel real until I share it with someone else. It's not that much of a bad thing; I just share my day with whomever I talk to, but I just wanted to know if anyone else feels the same.
8	Yes! I know what you mean!\n\nIf I don't journal it or share it with someone then it feels like it wasn't even real. I often begin forming a journal entry or story to tell someone in my head even as it happens or just afterwards. My mind is very much into connecting things and sharing them even if it's just to journal them for future me to read. \n
3	YYYYEEESSSS
2	I don’t really feel like I NEED to share but I do really like to share and often share lots of details of my life with my friends. I don’t know why, I just excites me to tell people what’s going on in my life, I guess.
1	Not always, but I do feel that way when it's something that has touched me deeply or has excited me in some way. (ex: a profound news article, the Olympics, my favorite song's lyrics, etc.)
1	Yush totally, I love to know others’ opinion about stuff I find interesting! When, for example, I watch or play something intricate full of plot twists I need to know how other people reacted to them. I love sharing my excitement, in fact I enjoy playing games with my so and friends, going to concerts or similar events etc. If i keep it to myself is real but not fun! 
1	Last week I called myself "sharing trigger-happy."  I find cool shit, I want others to enjoy the cool shit!
1	YES! I don't know why but I do. I HATE gossip about other people but if I experience something interesting or conversation-worthy MYSELF, you best believe I'm either a) talking about it with a friend next time I see them or b) texting it to one of my besties (especially if it's funny or in a funny context)!
9	INFP here, Dating an ENFJ	I love you guys! You're probably one of the coolest personality types. My girlfriend and I get along great. Some of the typical INFP things get in the way (being overly emotional, romantic). She is very understanding. I really like her. What do ENFJ girls look for in a guy, and how are they most fulfilled in romantic relationships?
12	Hey ENFJ girl here :) I’m currently dating an INFP guy right now and have multiple guy friends that are INFPs. I can’t speak for all the ENFJ girls out there but I have to say that I love that INFPs are so romantic. \n\nA few things that I noticed from interactions with my S.O and friends is that as NF types, we overthink a lot and I just wish that when I’m overthinking and sharing my thoughts with them that they would not interpret it as anything about them. Sometimes when I overthink I just need to share it with someone I trust. I am already clouded with thoughts I don’t need them to freak out too.\nAnother thing I noticed is that INFPs don’t mind silences... like at all. While I enjoy comfortable silences, when I feel like I’m always the one initiating conversations, I start to worry if they don’t care enough to ask me about things going on in my life. Sometimes there will be moments when he would just stare and not saying anything which causes me to nudge him and ask him about what he is thinking. Honestly, I just want to know what’s on his mind :) anything at all I’d love to hear.   \nThe biggest thing I wish he would notice and try to understand is how his tendency to avoid conflicts hurts me. I hate conflicts and am someone that would just like to talk and love it out while he tends to need time to digest his feelings which I completely understand and let him do but I always feel blocked out as if I have no say in the situation and that he is the sole decider of what happens next...  it gives me a sense of insecurity. There were a few times when he made accusations and got mad. While I would text him and explain myself calmly he would read and not reply. I hate that ahh :( \n\nObviously I know that not all INFPs are the same. I hope there is a little bit of what you can take away from this aha. But keep being romantic... just take some time to ask her about her needs without freaking out. She likes you that’s why she’s dating you😊
52	I like to think Capybaras are the embodiment of us :)

15	ENFJ reading people	Can you break down for us the process of how you guys read people's mind? I think it's fascinating, and I'd like to understand it better. Sometimes I feel like you guys can read my mind (INFP), Spooky, in a good sense. 
33	Can't speak for all ENFJs of course, but as an ENFJ, I see the same trends in different people. I pick up subtle social cues and hints and apply them to those patterns I know. \n\nTo be completely honest, it's a lot more intuition than strict thought process. We know how people work, so we understand what small cues mean and we're able to make connections based off of that. It's usually a gamble, we're not always certain that we're right, but more often than not, we are.\n\nHope his helped a bit! If you have any more questions don't be afraid to ask!
8	While we certainly can't read minds I would say that ENFJs do have the ability to identify feelings and emotions of others with some accuracy. It all comes down to countertransference which isn't unique to ENFJs. How developed this skill is depends on your individual life experiences, whether you have felt those emotions before or not. But I definitely think there's a lot you can tell about a person based on their behavior during an interaction. A person is usually giving off so many subtle cues as to how they are feeling, or what they are not trying to feel. You can pick up on anxieties, how they word things, or say things or where they look. You can see their insecurities even if they are trying to hide it. You can see how they want to be seen vs are seen. You want to help them reach their goals, and see their true self underneath the facade, the masks we wear in society.\n\nI'm unable describe it more into detail, but at the end of the day it's all projection and we can be wrong about people. But again it all depends on your experiences, how strong your countertransference is. If you never felt an emotion, how can you identify it? For instance if you haven't experienced trauma, could you say you really know what that person who has is feeling?  Some ENFJs haven't even really experienced any real pain in life and would rather remain on the surface of things. So in that way I would say it varies between different ENFJs.
8	As an INFJ, I would also like to hear how ENFJs can figure out such freakishly accurate insights about me. 
4	I agree with the others; it's about being perceptive of the subtle expressions people give off, both verbally and non-verbally and then indexing it against your past-experiences of what that combination of cues can translate into. \n\nIndexing requires the person to have a broad range of emotion, and being perceptive requires experience so when you put the two together you get a good "read". \n\n
7	Take all this with a grain of salt – it’s just a random opinion:\n\nIt’s just empathy and intuition. We feel what you feel when you feel it (whether we like it or not). It's by default. So we sense your motivations and intentions.\n\nI want to emphasize, it's our default setting. Honestly, I have such a love/hate relationship with it that I made an account just to reply to ur thread.\n\nMy issue? I wish I can turn it off tbh - you end up seeing so many shit and knowing stuff u dont want to know - which is excruciating becoz you see something that no one or very few ppl did so ur left with all this knowledge and no one to share it with. \n\nAnd if you do choose to share it, very few ppl will believe it. Coz most ppl work under the paradigm "i have to see it to believe it". \n\nIt's pretty isolating if u ask me. Yes it comes in handy but at the cost of possibly losing loved ones, no thanks.\n\n\nImagine knowing everyone, but no one knowing you.\n\n(it’s even worse when you see something the person himself isn’t aware of) ..\n\n\nWeirdly, if u want to stop an ENFJ reading you - just be very bluntly honest in expressing yourself. Don't hold back. If they sense ur lying, wearing a mask or keeping something from them - something's off and they sense that. So their spidey sense tends to zoom in and focus on u till it's sorted out.\n\n\nOff topic: In my experience: Don't try to read an enfj (unless ur another enfj). \n\nCoz alot of times it just comes across as projections. You can ask as many questions as you’d like but please do not assume and do not jump to conclusions. \n\nYou should seek to understand and not to judge. I think subconsciously that’s why enfj’s read people. They want to achieve understanding. They want to understand you. \n\nYou should watch this vid to understand: https://youtu.be/GIkA8aklwWw\n
6	Thoughts on INFJ/ENFJ couple?	I see a lot of INFP and INTP posts on here, but what do you guys think of INFJs? Any good/bad experiences?
10	I’ve been dating my wonderful INFJ partner for 3 years now and I can’t imagine sharing my life with anyone else. We met completely by chance, no mutual friends, from different cities, but still we stumbled upon each other. We’ve had our share of ups and downs, with a brief internal struggle she went through (which from reading a lot of INFJs must deal with) being by far the toughest. I’m not sure how much our types play a role in the relationship, I don’t buy into them 100% but if they’re to be believed then I’m an ENFJ and she’s INFJ. I think there will probably be combinations of every type who have found success and failure in their relationship. We’ve been lucky, but more than that, we’ve put in the work to help us understand the other and how they think and feel. For instance I was always a patient guy but sometimes when my partner is particularly low or struggling with something I know not to push her to talk to me but to make myself available always, be patient and wait for her to be ready. Likewise, she has learnt how to read through my always chipper facade. My opinion, any combination of the types have a chance at success and failure and you certainly can’t rely on ‘well matching types’. \n\nLong story short, I’ve never loved anyone more than my INFJ girlfriend. She’s the love of my life and I would move mountains to keep her safe, happy and feeling fulfilled in whatever she chooses to do in life. 
6	I’m an (f) INFJ and my fiancé is an (m)ENFJ. We have been together for 7 almost 8 years, have a two year old daughter, and another on the way. I think we have a perfect, or as close to perfect as you can get. Meet because we worked together (we were both in bad relationships when we meet, and became really fast friends) and have worked together since we started dating, even when we moved/switched jobs. We spend 90% of our time together, we are best friends. He makes me laugh more than I do him, and I take care of him more than he does me. It’s an easy relationship, we don’t ever fight, if we do it’s a disagreement, and we just find a solution or compromise, and move on. We almost always agree, or have the same view point on most things. We have a large age gap between us, but that hasn’t affected anything. He is a very loving and sweet guy, I couldn’t imagine a better life. 
4	great people. just take note that love can't be constrained by mbti. if it works then it works.
3	Well I just met an INFJ (F) and I am a ENFJ (M) in class and she is wonderful I feel like we are connecting really well. I am just trying to take it slow. But the connection feels very warm and welcoming! I think it can work out really well as long as the ENFJ is not too needy and demanding and understands the INFJ's need for alone time that they need and supports the INFJ but also the INFJ understands that the ENFJ needs some love and affection too with some words of affirmation.  
3	(F) INFJ here with a (M) ENFJ boyfriend: We've been together for a year and a half and honestly... no relationship has ever been easier. I always wondered HOW people could just say "when you know you know" but it's true and inexplicable! We have only had one fight, the rest have been minor disagreements that we work out... my INFJ side feels like it's the end of the world whenever we are talking about our disagreements haha but I assure you it's not. The best and easiest things that make this relationship work in my opinion is having a lot of the same morals and standards. While I am super sensitive, he is patient and kind in handling me. We are moving in together Cinco de Mayo and we are both super excited for this new journey :) I've never been so in love, felt so vulnerable yet protected, or so loved and appreciated by ANYONE... he's really... really a great catch <3 I wake up every day feeling like the luckiest girl in the world to know he too chooses to be with me every single day <3 I know he's the one :) This whole moving in thing is just going to confirm how right we are for each other. Sending you all the best of vibes ~ 
2	My boyfriend is an ENJF and I'm an INFJ. We've been dating for 5 months and I can say with certainty it feels... right. It feels easy. The communication, compromise, maturity, and the amount of what we share is perfect. \n\nI feel encouraged, and loved. 
6	INTP again! :D	I just can’t seem to leave you guys alone! >.< I apologise for the length and please don’t feel obligated to read but I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed by my emerging unfamiliar emotions and typing this out has helped tremendously! \n\nOk, so ENFJ(m) and I(f) are taking it slow, whatever ‘it’ is. We still have not defined what we are - mostly due to not having time. A few interesting things have cropped up that I’d love to get an ENFJ perspective on :D \n\nWe’ve now known each other for a month and his texting style changed overnight. Before, it was usually me initiating and he’d only do a few lines and then say, “I need to get back to work. Talk later.” He has yet to say that again, instead just letting the conversation flow naturally and his texting increased. In fact, the other day he texted first and I told him doing that made me happy and I asked how he was. He replied, “Actually, I just wanted to know how YOU were, honestly!” My stone heart fluttered a bit, haha. He said he wants me in his future.\n\nOur career industries kind of overlap and he has a big public project coming up. He told me I should come check it out if I felt like it and had free time. I said maybe (but honestly wasn’t cuz, eeep! People I don’t know!) Then early this week, he told me he had an opportunity for me, then asked if I wanted my business to be a part of this project O_O it’s a really great opportunity, so I said, “Yes!” We will be working together for two days! O_O eeep! We’ll see each other in our natural habitats! Double eeep!\n\nHe’s been texting about how excited he is about it :D in fact, two nights in a row he fell asleep while texting, haha. so, he had a big career-related meeting to go to the next day and texted me for advice. I gave him some and encouraged him, reminding him he was awesome. After his meeting, he texted me immediately and thanked me for giving him the confidence to go through with it. My heart was just swelling! He said he was so glad he found me and said I was an inspiration to him. I was grinning like an idiot all day, haha! NObody has ever talked to me like that! So then I started thinking maybe mentioning to him we should give ourselves a trial run for a few weeks at being “something” more than friends. I’ve haven’t considered doing that with anyone else so far. Also, I REALLLLLY want him, physically or I’m going to explode :P\n\nBut...then my INTP side kicked in :( my inner voice said it wasn’t anything special and that he probably says stuff like that to everyone because he’s so kind and awesome. What do you ENFJs think? Is he just being yalls normal level of kind and generous? Or is he possibly falling for me, too? Or should I push those relationship thoughts away and just enjoy this friendship for what it is? I can’t help but think we’d make an AMAZING power couple! And yes, I will talk to him about it but i can’t till later, but in the meantime, what do yall think?
6	I'm also an INTP (f) and this sounds very very similar to what I went through with my ENFJ (m) crush a couple years ago -- now happily my SO.\n\nI know you asked for ENFJ input, but I just wanted to say don't worry about those negative thoughts. I thought my ENJF crush was so warm and handsome and popular, way outta my league, but in reality he had a lot of those same feelings and reservations.\n\nI think you're on the right track. As a fellow INTP, I was amazed just at the uncharted territory of falling for someone... I'd never been in love before, and honestly didn't think it possible. In my case, my ENFJ got very wishy-washy early on because of personal anxieties, so if something like that happens just try to be patient and receptive. I'm a little biased, but I think a female INTP is perfect for a male ENFJ, but it may take them time to realize that.
3	Well it's hard to tell but definitely he cares alot about you. Maybe in a sense of romantic interest but wouldn't be mad at you if you told him you had a crush on him. More likely he already knows you like him so that's a plus. I really do hope it works for you two. You sound like a pretty cool chick xD. - An ENFJ male. 
2	My best friend is an INTP
1	ISTPs	This is the most ENFJ character I’ve ever seen: http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ClSVYdk7ZUc/VI-nAkPkv2I/AAAAAAAACw0/1TpbOtDRPY4/s1600/go-go-big-hero-6-movie.0.jpg\n\nReally, though, what annoys you about ISTPs? I’m curious.
2	she doesn't strike me as ENFJ... honeylemon however, does.
1	As a fellow ISTP guy who has been on a few dates with an ENFJ recently I am wondering as well.\n\nIf you want know ISTP stuff, ask away. 
1	ISTPs are harsh and mean :'(
14	Need advice about enjoying alone time	I want to know how to enjoy alone time. \nMy life is actually pretty ideal right now except for the fact that I live alone. My apartment is nice. I have shows to watch. I have hobbies (cross stitch, video games, and reading). I have a good group of friends that I hang out with a few times a week, and we have an active group chat. I'm in a relationship. I work full time. \nBut sometimes, like every week or two, I arrive home from work and after a few hours alone I feel incredibly lonely and sad. \nThere've been times in the past where I have been so socially busy that the only time I got to spend in my apartment had to be spent cleaning, and I actually started to crave alone time then. But then when I got a whole Saturday to myself, I only enjoyed it for the first half of the day; around 6 or 7 pm I started to feel tired and bored. \nI know that other people enjoy their alone time, and I wish I could too. Being as extroverted as I am, I'm honestly not sure if it's even possible for me to. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated, especially if you've been through something like this yourself. 
6	When you're alone, no one can help you, except yourself. It's the most scary yet empowering challenges for someone to overcome.\n\nSo be you. Watch what you want to, make funny faces, make random sounds because you feel like it, dance, sing.\n\n---\n\nAnd when the sad/alone waves come, either be sad, because you want to. Or just act so sad that it becomes funny.\n\nThe difference between a tragedy and a comedy is the perspective we are seeing it from.
5	I would look into developing more hobbies to occupy your time with. Or, you could try to organize more things to do that you can coerce your friends to do with you. But, my friend, some of this sounds normal, unfortunately. I also live alone despite work, school, friends every day. When I get lonely I turn to more hobbies like playing music or if all else fails I just go hang out with a laptop in a coffee shop to have people around me. It alleviates some of the dread. Who knows? That way you could even meet new people and flex those extroverted chops that we’re known for. Best of luck. 
5	Oh I can relate to you so much, it hurts. I have also recently got my stuff together, am in a relationship, have an apartment, finally streamlined my hobbies. I have felt exactly like you are recently, so thank you for the thread, it really gives me a feeling I am not alone!\n\nNow onto the advice. By far, I have employed the following strategies. I have tried to be more passionate about staying at home by focusing on my hobby. For instance, I love reading about psychology. Every day after work, I am looking forward to come and be left alone to delve into another chapter of Carl Jung's biography. In the meantime, I have already started researching which book I want to read next, adding it to the list of my books-to-read.\n\nAnother hobby is music. I have added a bit of a structure for my love of music, making a goal for myself each week (this week I want to clean up my music library by bpm to mix it better). \n\nBut in the end, I know the only way I will feel better is to get a pet... right now my apartment does not allow cats, but my dream is to have one. I have had a pleasure to host my boyfriend's cat for 3 weeks and every minor hobby like reading seemed a bliss, weekends were spent at home with great pleasure! Anyways, my dream is to have a pet companion soon to solve the "issue" that you mentioned in your post :)
2	I have a theory that the disquiet one feels when alone is Fi. It’s 5th in your enfj stack vs first in mine as an INFP but even though it’s my best trained function, it’s still quite tricky to handle. I’ve spent a very meditative year just permitting my Fi to ‘be’ but it’s quite draining and overwhelming at times, you just want it to go away. But by writing things out, crying it out a bit, and giving it some time to breathe and rid itself of negative emotions, you can kinda unburden yourself a lot and now it’s much easier for me to be alone without feeling sad. But, I don’t know how this would work did Fe-Dom, as Fi is essentially what life is generally like for me, and I don’t know how long or how difficult another type would find it (I found it quite extreme at times myself). 
2	This is super interesting. I'm barely E, like 51%. I cannot handle life if I don't have a solid dose of alone time, and people time. I need both. I think I enjoy my alone time because there are no expectations of me, or people to try and make happy/comfortable. I love pressure and competition and I also love making people happy, but being alone is my chance to recharge and not worry about any pressure. I can breathe for a second and recenter. I find tedious tasks help me quiet my self. I usually draw or edit when I'm alone. Just my 2 cents.
2	You know I have had my issues being alone. What I have learned through therapy and some really bad dark times is that you have to learn to be okay with yourself. I mean this maybe already the case for you but maybe not (not trying to patronize here) is learn to love yourself more. Learning that and practicing it made a huge difference I mean I always was super hard on myself I still am today but a lot less and that makes me feel a lot better in every way especially alone though I hate being at home living with my parents which I am planning on moving out. 
1	Find an activity or a hobby that you enjoy doing and that busies your mind. Maybe a sport, watching a show you like, reading a book, playing an instrument,..., the possiblities are endless. Just find something you love doing when you're alone and go for it! :)
1	It baffles me how ENFJ desperatly need people in their lives and can even tolerate toxic people just so they don't feel lonely. Seriously, enjoy your own company, most of you came alone to this world and will leave it alone.
1	This is coming from an INTP, but meditation is something you can try. There’s different kinds. Compassion meditation. Chakra meditation. Mindfulness. Lucid dreaming. Hypnagogia. You can also take a class. Tai chi maybe?
18	INFP: I met an ENFJ!	INFP here. Recently, I met an ENFJ. She was very encouraging and kind and she gave me some advice. Most people I know wouldn't be that supportive, but she was. I love you guys!
8	And we love you guys too. 
7	Fellow INFP here, and my ENFJ is the best thing that ever happened to me.  He carries social situations, and makes me more comfortable than I've ever felt.  When I find myself crippled with indecision, after hours of pondering a decision, he steps in and provides a different perspective.  I correspondingly, provide a level headed voice when he has hot headed moments or is unable to see the whole picture.  We have been together over a year, and the passion and adoration between us is stronger than ever. Not sure a better match is possible.  He is my soulmate.  ♥️
3	Male ENFJ (28) here. INFP and ENFJ's match quite well quite naturally.
6	The single one- enfj 22F	I’m having a hard time relating myself to other enfjs. Specifically in the relationship department. I was always the single one in my friend group... always. The longest “relationship “ I was in was for 1 month and I wouldn’t even call it that because he cheated on me with two other females. I find that I’m extremely picky too. maybe why I’m always single? I am a hopeless romantic for sure though... do other enfj people find it hard/uncomfortable to be in a relationship? Or am I having an identity crisis?
5	This is literally me.. 
5	INFP 22 M, here I find being picky to be a consequence of being: 1) intelligent and 2) a hopeless romantic. My only relationship ended because it I just didn't feel the same. What you should understand is that a girl like you is perfect for a hopeless romantic like myself. I feel like a lot of girls only like me for the wrong reasons. They don't know me, and aren't ready for a serious relationship.\n\nIt might feel like being single is a problem, but it isn't. Your keeping yourself open for when it feels right. That's attractive. That's cute. I want a girl like that, who wants to feel romance. I want to fall slowly, and cuddle, and feel out of control, and enjoy it. If that makes me a prude, then I guess I'm a prude. There are guys out there who want that romance, and you'll probably find him sooner than later.
2	19F\nliterally had seven relationships throughout high school (what a rollercoaster) and got tired of them/ life/ everything and decided to focus on myself around 2 and a half years ago. best thing I ever did for myself- decided to focus on personal development and had an awesome time. Now I'm like ~still doing it~ and can't tell if it's me continuing to be good to myself or just getting overly comfy.\nMaybe it's cynicism due to personal (unrelated to ENFJ) experience or maybe it's me just enjoying myself and my friends too much, worried I'm gonna ruin the dynamic with a new element.\nBut I am and have been aggressively single. I feel that the only way for me to get in a relationship would have to be with a person who is indisputably good for me and knows me very well. Every so often feeling "something" about somebody makes me realize I'm not weird. But I definitely do feel like as a more mature ENFJ, I have to get to know someone in a more real way to consider dating them.
11	ENFP here, and I just wanna say...	You all are awesome. Just caught up with my ENFJ best friend after a long time, and I just wanna say how much I appreciate having you people on this earth.  
3	AWW ENFPs are great too :)
4	I(ENFP) have a relationship with an ENFJ-person and couldn't agree more :D
3	I love some campaigning. Thank you for bringing light in this dark world. 857 you are awesome!
2	ENFPs are amazing :) 
11	Fashion	Hello!\n\nI adore enfj’s fashion sense and your eye for patterns, colors, etc. My female friends, confirmed enfj’s, all have great sense of style. So do you ladies follow particular fashion blogs? (If so, which ones) or would you have some other sources of inspiration? Please share your secrets! \n\nMuch love\nB
9	i do not. i wear what's comfortable.  typically a t and uniqlo jeggings.  xD sweaters and what not. :P i know nothing of fashion
1	One of my closest friends is an INTJ and he knows FAR more about dressing fashionably and more... interesting. I on the other hand (Female ENFJ) know nothing about fashion and I don’t really get that into it. Don’t get me wrong, I like to look nice and dress well for work and what not (get cute when going out, etc) BUT I’m not really interested in it any further than that. \n\nTypically I wear lots of cardigan outfits with long boots, short boots, or on some days I’ll just wear a hoodie, leggings and converse. Very diverse in “fashion” and only tend to splurge on buying different tops/scarves/jewelry. I love jewelry. 
1	Male ENFJ (28) here.\n\nI'm probably the exception to that norm. I mean... I probably do have a sense of fashion but I never explored it mostly because I don't have the means to.
1	Im a 17 yo male ENFJ and everyone tells me that!\nI think it's because we observe a lot and kinda intuitively know what looks good with what. My best advice would be to keep it simple, clean and good quality. Classic looks the best and if you wanna go out of the norm use accessories for that or a cool coat but that coat not too often
1	I haven’t thought about it for men, as I am a woman.\n\nFoundation for an outfit:\n1. Proportion + Body shape: Well proportioned outfit and complimentary to you body shape.\nYou can wear form fitting top and bottom, but loose top and bottom looks sloppy. If it has a lot of flow, you need to cinch the waist by tucking or a belt.  \n2. Right size: Should fit you. Don’t be afraid of what size you are. Clothes should never be too baggy or tight. (Should not ride up when you move, should not slip off your shoulders or hips, should not exaggerate your proportions.\n3. You should feel good wearing it. Wear what makes you feel good. Boho, punk, hipster, city chic, or whatever—own it!\n\nPulling an outfit together to make it less boring:\n1. Layering: jewelry, belts, scarves, jacket/sweater\n2. Wear COLOR: wear a pop of color once in a while; introduce your closet to a new color that flatters your skin tone\n3. Wear the right shoes. I know sneakers are very comfy, but it looks terrible with a dress or skirt. Wear them with a heel or a basic flat.\n4. It’s always good to have classic pieces in your wardrobe. They usually can be paired with trendier or bolder pieces you decide to wear: plain white or black tee, cardigan, denim, tailored looking trousers, basic cami, fitted sweater, etc...\n
4	INTP Fresh Off ENFJ Date	So, it’s me again from [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/enfj/comments/7tt5sf/intp_overthinking_enfj_compliments/)\n\nJust home from amazing day with ENFJ! We were going to wait two more weeks but he cleared some time for today and we went for it :D it was supposed to be an hour but we talked for three! Our “Ns” were just mentally making out the whole time, haha! \n\nHere’s the prob: we are super duper attracted to each other but we mutually pulled the brakes at the last second. I am not at a point where I could give 100% to a serious relationship but I don’t want to be just a bootycall. Also, I’m a commitmentphobe. He hasn’t said much in the way of relationships but he’s admitted he’s been doing casual, fwb and ONS over the last while and that he doesn’t know what we’re going to be. He said he doesn’t want to ruin whatever this is going to be because I’m “different” from his usual fare and wants me in his future. He then said you (as in him) only have sex for two reasons: to make someone fall in love with you or to express love to someone (which, in my mind, contradicts his admitting to casual sex, etc). \n\nMy new question is this: this whole time I’ve been explaining to him why it wouldn’t be a problem to be physical because I can compartmentalize. I can keep feelings separate. But, is it possible I got it backwards and that he’s worried about himself falling for me? I left him with the words,”I’m letting YOU take the lead on this. I’m open to anything.” We hugged and parted. I get a text literally 5 minutes later that he regretted letting me leave, lol! Do ENFJs (baring individual preferences of course!) need a defined relationship? Are you guys (in general) more comfortable with rules and labels? He’s too kind to ever hurt, so I won’t push physical intimacy if that’s his fear, but he’s also hawt and I want. :P (and yes, my hesitation in pursuing a relationship is complete fear on my part.)
3	I can only speak for myself, but I for sure prefer defined relationships, but I'm not afraid of commitment at all. I have been burned pretty bad in the past, but I still maintain my need for definition. An that definition can be super open as well, I just want cards on the table and both parties agreeing to play. If that makes sense. I can say I'm happily married now (ISFJ) and that is how we act and communicate with each other: overt and specific definitions. 
3	Some random thoughts. Male ENFJ here, 32:\n\n1. I am not afraid of commitment, as long as it's the right person. Figuring out if its the right person requires a lot of time and energy for me. Someone who is open and honest makes this easy. Someone who is duplicitous will be easy as well since I can sense you. I CAN SENSE YOU even if you hide it (whatever that is!)\n\n2. Labels give me comfort. It's the J function. I like labels since it makes it easy for me to decipher whether doing something is okay or not. While I find mystery intriguing, I will choose stability.\n\n3. ENFJs are romantic idealists. Words have an especially powerful effect of me, just as much as actions.\n\n4. I am generous with compliments. I tend to put people I like on a pedestal. I mean what I say and I am sincere BUT (and this is a warning), it can also be fleeting. For me to say "I really like you" is genuine at that moment but may change in a few days. So if you are taken easily with words, be careful how much emotional investment you are giving. Effort = interest, and effort costs more than words. 
2	Of course this is just one ENFJ speaking, but I do not find comfort in labels, titles, or petty relationship rules. If the man is busy (Two weeks is a bit outlandish) then give him his space. You played it right to leave the ball in his court ”I’m letting YOU take the lead on this." Sadly, it sounds like you are dealing with a broken ENFJ. No man should be texting you 5 minutes later with regret. That is a red flag no matter what personality you have. If you continue to date him and he drags his feet "Sexually". Embrace you inner ENFJ! Take charge, lead him like a true INTP, and roar like a lion while you tear his clothes off. Best of luck Logician.
2	I'm far more comfortable with a defined relationship. I've heard way too many stories of people asking "what are we?" only to be met with an answer they don't like. I would want to know what "we" are if I were to be in an emotionally/physically intimate relationship. It makes me much more comfortable and confident, which are things I really like, and at that point, I wouldn't fear commitment at all. But then again, I don't speak for everyone with my same personality type - there are really so many intricacies to personality. I just hope that might help even if only a little! I hope you guys figure things out :)
2	Super late to this but...I'm an ENFJ female, but if I had to guess, I'd say it's possible he could've been in casual encounters because it kept him from being vulnerable. Admitting you deeply care for someone and want to be in a committed relationship can be scary when you are as sensitive as a lot of ENFJs tend to be, especially if you've been hurt in the past. Even casual sex can hurt us because we do catch feelings, whether we want to or not. This doesn't apply to all of us, obviously. I'm super late to this but since it's been a month since you posted.... how's it going?
2	Sounds like there’s potential for something great! Good luck!! 
1	Male ENFJ here (28).\n\n> Also, I’m a commitmentphobe.\n\nThat's going to breed trouble...\n\n> He then said you (as in him) only have sex for two reasons: to make someone fall in love with you or to express love to someone...\n\nPretty much.\n\n> ...this whole time I’ve been explaining to him why it wouldn’t be a problem to be physical because I can compartmentalize. I can keep feelings separate.\n\n/r/INTP.\n\n> But, is it possible I got it backwards and that he’s worried about himself falling for me?\n\nHe may have caught onto the fact that you're a *commitmentphobe* and is afraid of getting hurt. I'd feel the same way. As I take relationships in general very seriously, I am very careful to only commit to intimate relationships if they are going to be serious long-term ones. He might be doing FWBs and ONSs, but he's “compartmentalizing” that himself and I'd even go as far as to say that he doesn't really want to do that, that it actually makes him quite unhappy.
5	Compassion Meditation	Have any of you not seen at least one of these? The Green Mile, Forest Gump, Elephant Man.
33	The feeling When...	The feeling when you are tired of giving a fuck about people/society and you tell yourself that you are going to give less fucks and then you catch yourself and laugh because you realize your personality is basically centered around giving fucks about people.
8	The MBTI does not define your personality though. \n\nIf giving fucks is your default, and you want to give less fucks, go ahead! My view is that it IS healthier to give less fucks.
3	Agreed. It's only a descriptor of current traits and what not. \n\nBut in my deepest of depths I am a caring person and that is a hard thing to tame. 
2	There's a difference between giving fucks about people, and giving fucks about what people think of you.
2	Sup fellow ENFJ. Yeah man, I don’t give a crap what people think about me. However, my whole personality revolves around caring for people, taking care of others, etc etc. Somedays I wish I could just turn it off and not give a care about anything or anyone. Everyone else sees my kindness and empathy as such a positive quality, but it can be so emotionally taxing sometimes...
6	Career help?	Hello friends! I am a junior in high school, so of course college is the big question.\nI have big plans mapped out. I know where I want to go, and that I want major in music.\nHowever, I'm stuck between music education and music therapy.\nAre we better therapists or teachers?
5	Which do you prefer?\n\nI suggest finding out the day-to-day differences between being a music therapist and music educator. The truth is, no one is ever fully sure of what they specifically want to do (not even me!) when we’re young. And that’s totally okay! Just do what you think you will enjoy and succeed at.\n\nPlease try to steer away from using MBTI to dictate your life choices. Your personality is an ocean and the MBTI describes only the contours of it.
5	I think we're def both. I love to help and advise people on things, but I also love to teach others. \n\nSince we're planners (look at you, only a junior in high school, but trying to plan the right path!), I suggest looking at potential programs at universities you would like to attend. Look at the costs and job opportunities. Would you like to teach in higher edu? Or high school? \nI would prob make a chart of pro/con list for each major and decide from there. You can also speak to your music teacher for advice as well. Maybe try shadowing a music therapist? 
2	Well, I'd say both are actually a viable pursuit since it's possible to get a teaching qualification on top of whatever is deemed necessary to quality for music therapy. I'm currently planning this for a psychology qualification, specialising in application of technology to aid in rehabilitation and therapy, but having teaching as an available career choice can really be a lifesaver should you be unable to secure a comfortable job in your desired sector
1	Luckyyyyyyy I want to do music but I need to finish my degree in computer science first.....
1	I know this is old, but I just found this sub! I am an ENFJ. I'm currently a teacher getting my master's in counseling, so I'd say we are definitely both.
5	What's your IQ score on believable test?	
3	Of course everyone is 130    \nBecause that's how it works. No, not the IQ scale, but self marketing online.
2	135ish. I have no common sense though and I'm also the most forgetful person on planet earth, sooooo, there are tradeoffs.
1	125- 130. Taken it three times and gotten between these numbers. 
1	135\n
1	Last time I took one I got a score of 144, and frankly I think it’s total BS.\n\nIf someone could link me a to a credible and accurate one, I would be willing to give a Reddit Garlic.
1	Last time I tested it was 127, but those tests are specialised BS and terrible at testing anything other than cognition and pattern recognition, so don't take them too seriously
1	I think it was about like 170 but I dont wanna brag so yeah
10	"ENFJ: TRIBE above SELF", do you agree with his conclusions about your type?	
1	IDK, but I do agree with a lot of what was said in the video. 
8	A few years ago I was an ENTP. Recently retook the test as that didn't align with myself at this time. Today I am an ENFJ which aligns so well with where I'm at. I'm a community organizer and solutions architect. Wanting to stop by and say hello. 25yo Male AMA.	Has anyone else gone through these changes? Do you think at some point it stays consistent or continues to change? 
2	Male ENFJ (28) here. Welcome to the side of the fence where the grass is greener. Just kidding.
1	What’s it like knowing you’re different.. are you curious about stuff? What parts of your personality do you think you’ve lost? (If any) 
1	"Community Organizer and Solutions Architect".... dude.... I'm so using that.
1	Out of curiosity, how do you get on and talk with friends now compared to when you were TP? Do you notice them reacting differently towards you, or any significant changes in relationships?
8	Anyone else here have partners that are INFJ?	I’m an ENFJ and my partner is INFJ and we get along great and we have many things in common and the only thing I have a hard time with is .. I love spending a lot of time with him, shopping or going to movies or just hanging out at home. But he loves to hangout by himself on the couch and watch tv for hours and I always feel like I’m annoying him. Is there any advice you guys have for me? 
1	Communication. I understand that extraverts feel lonely when they have no one to talk to but too bad, Im not your boyfriend. Once you guys understand each other, work together to find a healthy compromise. 
2	(Female ENFJ with Male INFJ) Introverts really need down time; it's how they re-energize. Communicate with him in a soft, nonpushy way so that he doesn't get overly fixated on feeling offended or sensitive. With my love, he sometimes would make me feel awkward with myself or like I was bothering him while he worked on his computer. But then, I would talk to him about it and he would sincerely  feel bad for accidently hurting my feelings. He would say that he doesn't mean to come off cold. It's rare now if it happens, when he is stressed or in a bad/off mood. Your guy probably doesn't mean to be distant; it's just how INFJs can seem sometimes.
1	Male ENFJ (28) here. What are your ages? If you're very young, he could just be immature. It is important for men in general to have their “nothing box,” a period of time where they engage in senseless or pointless activities to wind down. This is particularly true of Introverts. I think it would help you to explain to him that you need to spend time with him but that you also understand that he needs his time alone and try to figure out a way to compromise.
8	INTP Overthinking ENFJ Compliments	INTP female just met her first ENFJ male. Holy crap! I hope I meet more of you! It's a completely new world for me but with that comes all my lovely doubts and fears. First things first: we are both attracted to each other but are not in a position to be anything more than friends just yet (he's still in University and I'm focusing heavily on the business I just opened). But we've been upfront about everything and we're both open to the future, whatever that may entail. He's early 20s, I'm late 20s.\n\nI have only ever attracted damaged/unhealthy ENTPs and ENTJs, so my history with men is not the most positive experience. I'm used to insults, not compliments. Well, ENFJ is going through a tough time right now and I can't solve it. So, I reached out to him and said the best I could do was bring him over a movie, some hot chocolate and offer a shoulder to vent on. He replied, "You are fantastic, you know that? Even just that has made me feel a bit better XD"\n\nNo one has ever told me that before.\n\nI then told him how someone I thought was going to be a good friend actually ghosted me recently. He told me to text him any time, he'd reply and that he'd never ghost me.\n\nNow, he's waaaay overloaded and stretched so thin with work and school that I won't ever actually text him more than every couple of days to check in but, it was nice to be told that. (we won't even get to see each other until the middle of next month)\n\nMy question: how genuine are ENFJ compliments? Can I take what he says at face value? I mean the meaning. I get that, like, with the texting, he means well but it wouldn't be practical for him to reply all the time - so i care more about the meaning than the practice, if that makes sense. But if an ENFJ says you're fantastic, do they really think you're fantastic or is that a generic compliment? \n\nAlso, does it sound like i truly made him feel better with my offer or was that just a generic nicety? Also, if an ENFJ says they like you (friend or otherwise), does that mean they like you the same amount always (if you don't hurt them, of course!)? Damaged/unhealthy ENTPs will tell you they like you one day, promise you the world and then the next day pretend like they don't know who you are. So, i'm scared to hope for the long term, LOL! \n\n\n\n
8	I'm an INFJ who has a handful of close ENFJ friends. My ENFJ friends and I are very genuine with our compliments. I would never give someone a compliment that I didn't mean 100%. One of my ENFJ friends is the same way.  Sometimes, out of the blue, he'll give me a really sweet, genuine compliment and it will make my entire week. It makes me feel good because I can just tell that he means what he said 100%.\n\nBut you're right, it's not practical for him to respond to your texts all the time. He most likely said that because no matter how busy he is, he wants you to know that he's there for you if you ever need anything because he cares about you. And if he told you that you're fantastic, he completely means that. \n\nAnd I certainly think that your offer made him feel a lot better. You see, the thing with us xNFJs is that we take care of people all the time and continually go out of our way for others, but rarely get that in return. Simple gestures like offering to bring over a movie or letting us know that we can come to you with anything mean a lot to us. In general, we have a really hard time opening up to others (it makes us feel selfish and we don't want to be a burden), but just telling us that you'll always be there for us means the world. I know for a fact that he really really appreciated your offer because just knowing that someone cares about us enough to do something like that for us makes us feel so much better. ENFJs love to be taken care of by people so any gesture like that goes way farther than you could ever imagine. 
4	ENFJ here, I don't typically say any compliment that I don't mean genuinely (unless there's a social pressure to do so, e.g. family gatherings etc). I believe you can take what he says at face value, but that doesn't mean it will last forever - in my experience most relationships have an initial 'high' / 'new people are exciting' hump that most types experience before they level out and make realistic assessments about potential partners. Don't take this pessimistically though! Just something any new budding relationship should be aware of - don't let his enthusiasm build too much expectation within you and take it one day at a time. If you can walk the line between supportive and codependent, you'll have a decent shot of building a solid foundation to grow from.
3	> Now, he's waaaay overloaded and stretched so thin with work and school...\n\nTypical ENFJ behavior... *sigh*\n\nMale ENFJ (28) here.\n\n> ...how genuine are ENFJ compliments?\n\nThey are always genuine. I try to find the best thing I can about someone and then compliment him or her on that. I don't make compliments up. If I absolutely cannot find something to compliment someone on then I either try to comfort them or don't say anything at all.\n\n> Also, does it sound like i truly made him feel better with my offer or was that just a generic nicety?\n\nI would have been very happy to have received such an offer. I think it was genuine.\n\n> Also, if an ENFJ says they like you (friend or otherwise), does that mean they like you the same amount always (if you don't hurt them, of course!)?\n\nYou would have to hurt me pretty badly for my feelings about you to change.\n\nNow, here's a friendly warning: You're a Thinking type. ENFJ's usually feel misunderstood by those when it comes to emotions. Keep that in mind.
2	I always get an initial strong high with INTPs. I probably over compliment them and love to chase them. I just find it hard to maintain this connection once I’ve caught them. At that point I always zone out. There must be something behind that. 
2	I am an ENFJ and I compliment people as much as I can, and I am always genuine! However, I get nervous sometimes because I do it so much people don't think I'm genuine. I can guarantee you he is genuine, we care about anyone who we come to terms with! :) I don't think it's "generic nicety" at all. And yes, they do!\n
2	I's so happy for you!! Sounds like you're awesome and you found an awesome person! :) We're very genuine about compliments. Even if we have to search to find a compliment about someone, that thing we find will be correct and genuine.
2	ENFJ compliments are genuine.
6	INTP trying to understand a breakup	Hello guys,\n\nI am an INTP (20 f) who was in a short relationship with an ENFJ (20 m) until recently.\n\nWe met 2 years ago, and I've had a crush on him ever since. I was comfortable just being a friend he could have "more interesting" conversations with, though (sharing our existential crisis, ideas, or even just memes).\nHe is the one who suggested we get together, in early December.\n\nBut then, he broke up with me, a couple weeks later. He said that he wasn't ready for a relationship. That he loved me, as a companion, but wasn't in love with me...\nAnd then came back just 2 days later saying he was going to try and do his best at being with me, because it's a choice he wanted to make.\nAnd like an idiot, I welcomed him back. Even though I knew it would happen again.\n\nAnd it did. About 3 days ago, he called me, telling me that our relationship just wasn't doing it for him. That sometimes, he just couldn't help but think he'd rather be single, and that it felt like he was cheating on me.\nThat I came into his life at the wrong time. So he dumped me for the second time in just 2 months.\n\n\nHe's an ENFJ, surrounded with people. Good at reading them. And yet, he isolates himself. He probably feels like no one understands him the way he understands others. And it's terrible feeling lonely even when there's a lot of people around you.\nI know I wasn't good at comforting him. I never really knew if he wanted physical contact, or to hear possible solutions, or just for me to listen to him. I just wish he'd have left me more time to get better at it.\n\nI would say I was very compliant in our relationship. I tried my best to understand him. I tried not to be clingy, and agreed to leave him alone whenever I felt he wanted it.\nBut now I wonder if I should have been more insistant, just so he wouldn't be left overthinking things.\nI'm simple in a relationship. I just want to give love, and be loved back. He used to say he found that soothing.\nHe sometimes said things that made me believe he wanted us to stay together for a while. But then he changes his mind and dumps me.\n\nSo really, I don't understand where it went wrong.\nI can't help but feel like a plaything. He did tell me he loved me, and wanted to be with me.\nHe also told me I should become more independant because you can never know when people are going to leave you.\nAnd I agree with him, to an extent. I just don't think it justifies him leaving me the way he did. \nIt hurts me he's had the energy for relationships with other girls, but not me.\nAnd above all, it hurts me to see him isolate himself like that. I wish he'd let himself rely on someone, and just let himself relax.\n\n\nRight now, I want to reach out to him and tell him how I feel. Tell him I'm hurt, but that I'm also grateful for our time spent together. T him how I miss talking to him.\nBut I also want to respect his decision of leaving me. \n\nIf you guys have any insight, I'd be happy to hear it.
4	Well first of all, he seems to be not super self-aware/emotionally mature (common at 20). However valid his feelings, he's not communicating them well and he's pushing the blame onto you.\n\nAs for insight into what those feelings might be, I know at his age I thought of myself as a romantic cause I loved people and being loved. I thought I was gonna find my one true love and be happy for life, etc. etc.\n\nNow, at 25, I'm poly (or non-monogamous really) and realized that dating isn't for me. The feelings behind both choices are the same, but when I was less self-aware I thought the energy I got from being loved meant I should seek out the ultimate, number one love. Now I realize I don't want to commit to one person because I'm capable of loving many people at once.\n\nI don't know if he'll end up where I have, but he may be making the same mistake I made at his age - he does love you and want to be with you, but hasn't figured out why he still feels powerful love toward other people. And since he doesn't know what to do with those feelings, he assumes it means he must not want to be with you.\n\nI'd recommend you don't let him back into your life romantically right now, he's clearly not sure where his head's at and so he throws blame onto you which makes you feel worse. I don't think that cycle is gonna be healthy for either of you. But if you want to tell him your feelings I don't think that could hurt. ENFJs like to be told people's honest feelings openly. I just wouldn't parlay it into getting back together.\n\nHope that helps/makes any sense at all.
4	He may be trying to understand himself, when you're strung-thin without an emotional outlet (even if you're willing to be one) and struggling with who you are it's very hard to commit.\n\nI myself as an ENFJ find it incredibly hard to commit long term, the overthinking gets to me as I always shake in my boots; usually placing myself at a distance but encouraging others to open up so I can help them. It took me a long time to even realize that I wasn't meeting them half way, and that by keeping a distance I was hurting them more than I thought.\n\nWhatever you do, please do not take this personally. I understand how hard this can be for you as I've done it to people before, but just know that you've done all you're required to do. You met him half way, he didn't meet you there. \n\nYou might not be able to help him anytime soon, if he's anything like me he just needs time to find himself and figure out why he's struggling to open up. For me it was due to my intense fear that I'd become like my father, but everyone grows up differently and is in turn affected differently.\n\nI wouldn't say talking to him is a bad thing, a well thought out and logical explanation of why you felt hurt is not only understandable but encouraged. He needs to see what his actions are doing to people, growth comes from understanding.\n\nJust know that if you aren't being met half way you aren't going to be happy long term, you don't need to give up yourself for someone in a relationship. You need to be accepted just as he needs to be, never settle for someone who doesn't understand this. You can stay friends until he works it out, break down his barriers as friends if you really want to. \n\nBut don't break yourself in the process, you deserve more than that.
2	I'm an INTP male who likes an ENFJ female.\n\nReading your struggles, your thought pattern seems to be analogous to that of mine(all of it.)\n\nMy solution for you would be to not blame yourself or second-doubt yourself. We are not always(if ever) responsible for the things that transpire. Some people just have some personal issues that they need to solve before they are them again. I feel like this was the case here.\n\nJust don't blame yourself. From what you describe I conclude that he probably has some psychological issues he needs to take care of. Until then, try to let him be, and let go.
1	Male ENFJ (28) here. For once, he's 20 so he's still very immature. That's normal. Secondly, he's a Feeling type. I personally think that we don't match very well with Thinking types.
1	>	He's an ENFJ, surrounded with people. Good at reading them. And yet, he isolates himself. He probably feels like no one understands him the way he understands others. And it's terrible feeling lonely even when there's a lot of people around you. I know I wasn't good at comforting him. I never really knew if he wanted physical contact, or to hear possible solutions, or just for me to listen to him. I just wish he'd have left me more time to get better at it.\n\nBasically how I feel as an ENFJ. I can read anyone like a book, and somehow, can never get past the first page of my own without being disgusted with myself. And when someone tries to give their insight on me, I shun it, hate it, because in some way, I know it’s true.\n\nI feel self-conflicted the same way your ex does. If you truly, *truly* miss him, think if it’s worth it to have him back in your life. Just talk to him about it.
14	ENFJ needing some ENFJ friends	Hello! I am an ENFJ who has yet to meet another ENFJ in person. I get very lonely and often feel extremely misunderstood. All of my friends, including my husband, are INTs or INFs. Most of them are also Ps. This makes me feel like the outsider of my friend group . \n\nThat being said, I'm hoping to find some ENFJs who are willing to message back and forth and connect with. Message me if this sounds like fun to you :) \n\nAny advice? Comment below I'm all ears. 
4	Male ENFJ here (28). Yes, sometimes I wish I could also hang out more with ENFJ's. I use Discord and Whatsapp.
3	Hello! Sounds like fun. :)
3	I highly encourage everyone to join the discord. We had a blast last night peering into each others souls ;)
3	I am also in. I am female 23 and I absolutel understand you
2	Hi! I signed up with Reddit yesterday. I'm just reading this thread now. I would love to meet more ENFJs too. I've only met one in my life. I'm 28, female. You stated you guys are using an app. Was there decision on one of them? I would love to join. :\) I need more ENFJs in my life. lol
1	Hey HeartofAmythist,\n\nI'm an ENFJ, Male (23). I completely get what you're going through, finding someone who can connect to and understand me is a constant struggle - it's definitely one of the uphill battles I face day-to-day.\n\nI find when I'm struggling and feeling lonely within my friend group that it's often a change of perspective that makes me feel better, sometimes you just have to look from a different angle. \n\nYou after all are the one who chose them, just as they chose you; a connection between people of different personality types and yet you're all still together. That means something, right?\n\nSo my method is to go over just why those people and their personality types are around me and what drew me to them in the beginning. I always surprise myself with the answer, finding myself that little bit more involved and excited to see them just because I took some time to reflect.\n\nIf you're still craving some ENFJ attention you can always go to a popular chat room game and meet a wide variety of people (such as VRChat), or simply put yourself out there and do more activities if chat rooms aren't your thing.\n\nI wouldn't object to messaging back and forth, although I'm often wrapped up in the stress of being a 23 year old. Still, feel free to message me if you'd like to start a casual chat.
1	I am with you too! ENFJ male 24 I have been in a dark place. Feeling very lonely lately it's a combination of people not putting remotely as much effort as I do into friendships and be focusing too much on work and school. I wish that I could just be more social and have more social time but I don't and it makes me feel awful. 
1	So I guess I'm not alone in this feeling of being misunderstood and lonely.\n\nMy guy is an IFNJ, so I lucked out. This summer, we made a new friend and he is an ENFJ like me, and boy, is he really like me. \n\nAs a female, it's already difficult making decent friends. Throw in my persona ... and it becomes almost pointless. \n\nOh well, quality, not quantity ... but, it sure would be nice to have a female bestie.
10	An Introverted ENFJ who does not like meeting with people?	Hello all. I'm new to all this. I took the personality test a few times and always comes back with ENFJ. \nA lot of the descriptions makes sense but u ad.it to being Introverted and that seems to directly contradict ENFJ. \n\nI like to work alone and I get a little anxious I have a meeting on my schedule. \nWhen it comes to going to events, I'm happy once there but usually almost talk myself out of going. \n\nDoes this sound like an ENFJ to you?\nReally trying to figure this out. 
6	Female ENFJ with anxiety here. Totally understand how you feel. Most descriptions of an ENFJ seem too good to be true and can be intimidating pictures to live up to. However, you do not need to be a textbook ENFJ, you will be most happy as your own kind of ENFJ that's specific to you. \n\nEven as an ENFJ It's normal to want to avoid social interaction. People are just awful. We have natural abilities to understand and interact with them, but pur abilities can be overshadowed by our outlook and fears easily. \n\nIf you want this to change, slowly work on building your confidence. You have it in you ;) 
7	Male ENFJ here (28). I am extraverted, yes, but I can also get anxious in social situations because I want to present my best self.
5	Hi, INFP here. You can have social anxiety and still be an extrovert. There is this problem with the definition of introversion. Being able to appreciate alone time is simply not enough. Social anxiety is a disorder that is systemic in the western world, and I see this so often where extroverts claim to be introverted. Hell, some even people even consider it fashionable, (rolls eyes).\n\nIf you suspect you are an introvert look into cognitive functions. ENFJs cannot turn off their Fe. INFJs on the other hand, find Ni to to be inescapable. Fe is the using of information relating to morality and emotion in a social context. Ni is this spontaneous insight, it's as if you can see why things happen or what will happen.\n\nAs for the social anxiety there are a couple of things you can do for that. As someone who suffer from anxiety I find that mindfulness practices help tremendously. In mindfulness one must let themselves feel, but they do not let it effect them. For example if one feels anxiety they must understand that they are anxious. Then, they let go, for anxiety will not serve them. Stop, take a deep breath, and bring yourself out of your head and into the present. If you ever feel anxious try to let go, and it gets easier the more it is practiced. Behaviorism is a school of thought in psychology that focuses on behavior rather then any cause. It states that behavior can be modified by practice. So if you're feeling anxious around people you need to spend time around people. In sum, let go of your feelings of fear and get some expirence being around others. I know it's helped me.\n\nENFJs belong to a group called the NFs  (intuitive feelers). Social anxiety is pretty common among NFs including the extroverts, so you're not alone.
2	This is all great stuff to think over. Thank you all. I look forward to diving more into all aspects and growing as an ENFJ. 
1	Yes yes yes. I'm an enfj but I have anxiety. Especially when in new situations or when I'm not familiar with someone, my anxiety is off the charts.
1	Wow. This is so illuminating. \nI always thought my hesitation to be around people was being an introvert but u definitely see how it could be more of an anxiety thing. \n\n 
1	introversion is not the same as social anxiety.
6	How well can you read INFP/ENFP?	
7	ENFJ here. I don't have a lot of experience with INFPs, but ENFPs are the bane of my existence. \n\nOne minute you are totally in sync, completely on the same page, having so much fun and you are closer to them than anyone else then all of a sudden, poof they disappear and won't follow through on plans or answer your texts. \n\nFor me ENFPs are torture because they have so much "potential" but they don't have the drive (J). They are the human form of my pet peeve. \n\nI may sound really snobbish but this is just my emotions at the core. 
5	My mother and one of my best friends are INFP’s. I can read both of them like a book. They get a little over emotional without thinking through the options sometimes which can be a tad bit annoying but, aside from that, I love them both very dearly and we typically get along very well. :)
6	So, what am I thinking right now...
5	I love INFPs as friends, the kind that envelop you in philosophical discussions using abstract concepts and a dreamy demeanor. They're very comforting for me, and they're often "old souls" and quite artistic, which I appreciate.\n\nENFPs are fun to be around, but they can be a bit flaky with responding to messages/texts. I had one tell me that they admired me for my (J) drive and focus.
4	I think they’re the hardest to read, but I am always really attracted to INFPs on an emotional level. We always seem to get on well but damn I don’t understand why. 
3	Male ENFJ here. Pretty well? Especially INFP's. I dated one.
1	I know few INFPs (one is being my mother, for example) and one ENFP. INFPs... Very easy to read, ENFP one not that much, but still easy. I feel like I might be a bit weird when it comes to INFPs, since so many ENFJs and INFPs claim that their connection is amazing, while I can't feel it at all, especially when it comes to males. Matter in fact it's vice versa to be completely honest. Only type I really can't get along, sadly. :(
1	I can read INFP pretty well but ENFP... no. They're very unpredictable for me. That's weird.
1	My mom is an INFP. Sometimes I read her perfectly. Other times I am waaaay off. I think they are unpredictable really. 
7	ENFJ - Lost and confused	Where do I got and what do I do? The 'life' questions are starting to become more prevalent and I just keep feeling like I am 'wasting time'. But I have no idea where to go with my life now. I have a job(not a career nor do I want it to be) but its just not fulfilling. I have a good family life currently but I just feel stagnant. I have 1000+ goals I constantly give myself a hard time about because I am just not good enough and I can't focus my energies on one thing. I am a perfectionist and so constantly critique myself (and being far from anything perfects means I have a lot I critique).\nHow do you stabilize from this? My emotions go haywire sometimes, and at other times I am just cold. \nMy boyfriend's mother is an ENFJ but downright the craziest most egotistic psychopathic bitch that we just cut ties with over Christmas. She is the epitome of what can go wrong with our personality type and I am scared of ever becoming that monster. \nI feel like I am boring to other people because I don't seem interesting to myself. I am a shy extrovert, who didn't used to be so I just want it back.\nI lost my father during university a few years ago and to say it derailed everything would be an understatement. I have become a very different person and clarity has gone. Forcing happy is a bitter feeling and it feels like I betray the darker parts of me when I am trying to be happy. \n\nFinding a fulfilling job, being happy with myself both inside and out, being fun and outgoing as I used to be just all seem like the main things on my mind all the time. I smoke weed to relax, and tried stopping to see if that helps but I just find its the only thing that puts the smile back on my face when something just slams me down. I don't feel like this is a problem right now but if anyone has experience with that it would be good to hear it.\n\nIn short, send help. 
5	There's certainly a lot to get through. You have your dreams plus having felt too much. I think one thing that people who identify with being an ENFJ have an issue with (myself included, I'm definitely not an exception) is being prone to a lifestyle that's sprint through every issue because we want to accomplish things, right? \n\nWell, that may work for smaller issues, but once things get very difficult, that sprint can really end up hurting. \n\nI don't know your life in full, but it doesn't sound easy. Loosing people you're close to, trying to find purpose, career, and personal image of who you are vs. who you were are all legitimate things to be concerned with. I'm sure you recognize that, but sometimes it's different when it comes from someone else. It's a lot for a single person to handle, especially someone who wants to solve all the problems/do the best thing possible. I say this from personal experience about how much I know it sucks. \n\nSo, my advice would be this: Pace yourself. Take smaller bites into the issues that hurt, but keep going at it over time. That's easier said than done and I can't necessarily tell you which way of pacing yourself works for you. It could be sitting down with your SO and talking through the things you want and the steps to take it. It could be trying something new or to keep going. It could be sitting down with a professional. Your situation brings up unique solutions I can't see, but maybe those closer to you can. \n\nI'm glad you're looking for help. I really am. There are options for you.
2	Male ENFJ here.\n\n> I have 1000+ goals I constantly give myself a hard time about because I am just not good enough and I can't focus my energies on one thing.\n\n[I once made a post about some of the exact same struggles on this sub.](https://www.reddit.com/r/enfj/comments/7k4ul6/personal_sideprojects_and_focus/)\n\n> My boyfriend's mother is an ENFJ but downright the craziest most egotistic psychopathic bitch that we just cut ties with over Christmas.\n\nDoesn't sound like an ENFJ to me. But those are character issues, not personality issues.\n\n> I lost my father during university a few years ago and to say it derailed everything would be an understatement.\n\nI am so sorry that this happened to you...\n\n> I don't feel like this is a problem right now but if anyone has experience with that it would be good to hear it.\n\nVery honestly? I became a Christian. Solved all my problems. I even got married to the most wonderful ISFJ and we do missionary work in Japan—which I would never have dreamt of before my “collapse” (like yours) a few years ago.
1	You certainly have a lot to swallow, I can give you that, but building up the gumption to perform everyday tasks, no matter how big or small, is something that must be prioritized significantly. Maintaining an organized yet very realistic list of what you’re capable of accomplishing on a day to day basis is a great way to start this.\n\nJudging from how you’re eager to improve yourself, you won’t end up like your boyfriend’s mother at all. Separating yourself from negative people such as herself proves that you’re smart, smarter than most, and that you’re willing to embrace change for you and your SO’s happiness.\n\nI know your father meant a lot to you, but you need to be strong and pull through. Think about how proud your father must be right now, looking down upon a strong and independent woman going through something that nobody ever wants to go through.\n\nIf you’re not happy with your job, *quit.* If it’s causing damage towards your psyche and clearly giving you anxiety, it’s frankly not worth your time to nose dive into that shallow puddle any longer.\n\nYou are a beautiful person going through something awful right now. Pull through, cherish those that you love. Where you are right now is temporary, and maintaining good mental health is what you need to get through the temporary muck. I sympathize with you. If you need any advice, help, or just someone to talk to, me and all of the other great souls here are always willing to help. Take care!
0	why am i so jelous of my successful friends?	so im an infp and im not realy the jelous type,but some ofmy friends just have this perfect lives and it kinda irratates me,they have lots of friends,girlfriends,doing good in school,ect...while i suffered with social anxiety in high school,and they both realy good looking dudes,i suffered with social anxiety,struggling with school work,bullies,...........anyways on of my friends looks superhot hes like a male moddle,and iv never seen him struggle in his life,he is the coolest guy in his group of cool friends,and his dad earns alot of money,he has the best girlfriend,theres just nothing wrong ,the other friend is so perfect also,he does good at university,has lots of friends no social anxiety,a hot girlfriend,and just has everything???
4	they don't lead perfect lives. everyone has their own problems and find ways to cope with it.  
2	Hello! Fellow INFP here. I would just like to say that nobody is perfect, even if they seem like they are to you. \n\nIt sounds to me like you struggle with a lot of insecurities and have yet to find ways to be content. Start looking inwards and stop looking at what your friends have or don't have. Focus on your own strengths and weaknesses and things that you like about yourself. And please honestly try to find something you like about yourself.
2	Compare yourself against yourself from yesterday. Anything good to say? Make it so.
3	I [ENFJ] don't really struggle with jealousy. Maybe try the INFP sub? 
1	Male ENFJ here. Try /r/infp. Don't worry about what other people have. You don't know their struggles.
3	Question.	How many of you feel like you’re manipulating your own thinking to convince yourself of feeling something you do not feel? \n(From my ENFJ roommate) 
5	Yes, I do! \nEither to try to feel what I think that the people around me want me to/think I should feel, OR to try to feel what someone else is feeling in the rare case that I am not already absorbing their feelings and want to sympathize/empathize better. 
2	I do this often. (ENFJ female) \n
2	Yes! That's an enfj trait??
1	Male ENFJ here. What?
1	Harmony (Fe) vs Authenticity (Fi) all humans need to do both, but Fe comes more natural for ENFJs with Fi being also necessary but it "feels more foreign" to ENFJs for it is a shadow function.\n\nBoth are part of feeling, they both do a dynamic contrast where the interaction of Fe with Fi are actually more intense because of the tension between Fe and Fi.  What I am saying is Fe is stronger for it has Fi to provide both Affinity and Contrast to help you understand your Fe even better with the Fi providing a secondary point of view, and Fi is stronger with the Fe backdrop to also provide the same affinity and contrast.\n\nhttps://image.slidesharecdn.com/theartofvisualstorytelling-101004040346-phpapp02/95/the-art-of-visual-storytelling-11-728.jpg?cb=1286165155\n\nhttps://image.slidesharecdn.com/theartofvisualstorytelling-101004040346-phpapp02/95/the-art-of-visual-storytelling-12-728.jpg?cb=1286165155\n\nhttps://image.slidesharecdn.com/theartofvisualstorytelling-101004040346-phpapp02/95/the-art-of-visual-storytelling-13-728.jpg?cb=1286165155\n\nWith affinity and contrast, one provides the form of an object, what is the uniting principle, while the other provides the speration and where one form ends and the other begins.  Both affinity and contrast are neccessary for perceptual story telling like vision, sound / music, etc.\n\n**But the same goes for both thinking and feeling**lj:  Thinking and Feeling are just two different ways to assign value to things in the universe that the Intuition (Pattern Recognition) and Sensing perceive in the universe.  And we use two different styles of feeling and two different styles of thinking to help organize our judgements and assign value.\n\nAnd thus both forms of Fe and Fi are important, Harmony (more of the Fe style) and Authenticity (more the Fi style).
1	ENFJ fem. I can't get over how accurate this statement is. Just yesterday I thought something sweet about my boyfriend and immediately thought "but do you really feel that way or is that just how you think you should feel?"
10	It's 25F outsideans this 14yr old is under a towel fresh out of the dryer. Lots of love to you guys!	
13	anyone else annoyed by the stereotype -	- that we want everyone to like us and it's such a massive deal to us?\n\nSure I prefer we get along & no matter what I will give you basic respect and be cordial.  but if you REALLY dislike me, that's part of life and I really don't care, and certainly won't put on a charade to try to convince you otherwise.
9	At this point I’m just annoyed at all stereotypes 😂 \n\nMBTI devolves into a circle jerk so quick that every MBTI related community eventually turns to shit, bar none.\n\nI prefer the Enneagram because it forces you to look at your flaws, defence mechanisms, and motivations.
5	It's very true for me, so I have no right to complain 😂
4	Male ENFJ here. I used to a people-pleaser when I was younger. With maturity comes the realization that all personalities come with inherent strengths and weaknesses. I learned, little by little, to care less.
2	i think for me it's more like i want to maintain my friendships once i've got them.  it takes a hell of a lot of energy for me to burn a bridge and accept the disconnect
2	Yesssss, it’s frustrating as hell that people make such assumptions. Like if we truly can’t get along, I’m going to my best to give you respect when needed and never make contact other wise. 
1	I totally understand. I don't feel as charismatic and miss popular as we are usually portrayed. 
7	How to Get to an ENFJ's real State of Mind	Hello everyone! I sincerely adore ENFJ's and have had the chance to know a few. What they all seem to have in common is a true inability (unwillingness?) to be introspective or share those thoughts on a personal level.\n\ni.e. Not theory, not who they are as a person, not how work is going-- but in real time when there is a problem or something going on, currently.\n\nBeing married to an ENFJ, this often leaves me at a loss! It has me wondering how to help him; but if he doesn't even have the ability to express exactly what is going on, how can I?\n\nJust to clarify, this has been a several months-type thing; so waiting and seeing is not helping. He has told me, "It must be nice to always know how you are feeling!"\n\nAny insight would be most appreciated. 
7	I’d say it’s not that I/we don’t know what feelings are being experienced. I find it awkward to tell anyone about my emotions or feelings unless they make me feel really comfortable doing so. I’d much rather help them most of the time. There have been a few people in my life who have genuinely made me want to open up. Their characteristics have all been extremely high levels of emotional intelligence, with calm and caring personalities. It’s about getting me to believe you genuinely care and want to help me without judgement. 
5	I'd say it's less about knowing what it is and more about finding the perfect way to say it so that it makes sense. ENFJs are wordsmiths, and I personally have had hard times when I knew what I was feeling, but it took me a solid couple of minutes of exhausting effort to frame it in such a way that I could use words. I could have just said what I felt, but it wouldn't have made sense like that and it needs to be perfect. It needs to evoke the right response from the person I'm talking to (example: if I don't want sympathy then I'll phrase it differently than if I do want sympathy and a hug, for example. Neither will be lies, but they'll evoke different responses). It needs to resound correctly with what I'm feeling. It needs to not contradict itself (which is difficult when dealing with emotions), etc. 
5	For anyone, it takes courage, patience, time and effort to practice introspection. ENFJs can be quite complex in how they feel and think, a buzz that can be overwhelming to those that don't entertain their personal background noise. A big turnoff for an ENFJ is appearing weak or awkward or stupid in front of another person whom they admire and want to uphold their image. My best friend and I are an ENFJs who are obsessed with personal growth and personal expression, so at least I can say that your sample-sized experience is not the same for everyone of our personality type.\n\nMaybe this can help?\n[ENFJ - The Protagonist](https://www.16personalities.com/enfj-personality)
1	This post may not be that helpful to you...but have you ever heard of the **Gordian Knot** *which is often Alexander the Great*?\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_Knot\n\nThat is ENFJs, they are the Gordian Knot!\n\nAll this Fe, combined with webs of Ni and they, the ENFJs are just not in touch with their Ti for it is hard to be in touch with your 4th function even though it is the function we use to balance out our 1st function.  The 1st and the 4th function compliments ***and*** contrasts creating *a dynamic tension.*\n\n-----\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI do not really have an answer for you.  Personally I think ENFJs are a mess, **a damn sexy mess**, but a mess none the less.  Do not get me wrong, I love and adore ENFJs, but I just can't understand them sometimes...and that in some ways makes ENFJs ...***sublime.***
4	INFP Thinking I Divulged Too Much Too Soon To My ENFJ Match	So I've met an ENFJ online.  At least in conversation we really hit it off well. We've been messaging all week and have been texting with her all literally all weekend. Up till 2am yesterday and from 10am to 9pm today.  Just rapid fire text and response and we even have a date set up this week.  Things are going great and I really like this person.  But I'm a recent divorcee.  As a matter of fact, it's not finalized yet.  I wanted to be up front and honest with her from the getgo so I briefly told her my situation when I had the chance. She asked me one question.  "How long has it been since we separated?" I answered and she responded with "Ah." and then total radio silence.  This might be more of an online dating question but i just want to know if maybe I was too upfront?  Did me being too open scare her off? Not sure if I did something wrong, or if its in an ENFJs nature to heavily consider something before responding, or if maybe that was just something as simple as my response was a deal breaker.
3	Hmm, I am guessing that for her it’s not the fact that you divulged it too soon, but rather the fact that you dated "too soon" after separating. Not that it's wrong at all though!
2	With online dating, don’t talk about the bad bits until you’ve met up and made a connection. I don’t think the MB type has anything to do with her not replying here. She just presumed you have too much baggage right now. 
0	Opinion on fun house mirrors?	I find fun house mirrors (the warpy ones that make you look tall or short) amusing, and then I get over them and would rather do something else. I already knew what I was going to see, so when I do, I can appreciate the absurdity, and then I'd rather move on and do something more thrilling.\n\nI'm wondering if this is a difference between Se and Ne humour? My ESFJ friend finds them absolutely hilarious!!!\n\nOpinions? Thoughts?
2	Not really that cool to me 
1	I get bored easily in general unless something is very mentally stimulating. (whether that be reading people/talking to them/emotionally connecting to them or playing strategy games or reading a very interesting book or..my favorite thing of all: ADRENALINE RUSH.. roller coasters, racing, competing, etc)\n\nAside from these listed things among some others, I get bored. So something like fun house mirrors really wouldn’t amuse me all that much. 
4	eNFJ looking for resources!	I'm looking for some specific ENFJ resources for self improvement and such. \n\nOne of the think I'm looking for is something that will help me get my "happy spirit" back. I find myself in a Ti-grip often and I want to feel like myself again.
2	Male ENFJ here. [I got this premium profile.](https://www.16personalities.com/orders/checkout/ENFJ) I highly recommend it (I am not affiliated with the publisher).
5	An INFP's honest thoughts on ENFJs	Probably my favorite type based off of descriptions alone. (That might be stupid of me to say but oh well.) Where do ENFJs usually hang out? I'd love to have some ENFJ friends. I like my current friends, but I want some ENFJ bros if you know what I'm saying. That probably sounded really quirky, but who cares? I was told by another INFP that you guys and girls are everywhere. Also, you ENFJ girls are so great! I think I saw an ENFJ in her pink pajamas at a theme park Christmas play a few weeks ago (I couldn't make this up if I wanted to). She gave absolutely no fucks about it and was super bubbly and cheery throughout the entire thing, despite herself sitting alone in the very back. Maybe she worked there but had the day off, or was a girlfriend to one of the actors, but screw it! I don't care! It takes balls to do that! Most girls would try to get ready to go to something like that. She didn't care and she still looked great! Gotta love the rebels. I always root for them. \n\nPlus, I want to be an actor, so she would have loved what I am passionate about. That to me is super attractive. Like, out of the thousand or so girls I've even been remotely attracted to in any way, including all of my girlfriends or crushes, she was the most unique amd standoffish. I just got this vibe that if I talked to her, ot would go really well regardless of what happened. You know how with some people you just know there's some deeper connection than attraction at a level beyond what most people experience. I don't know if soulmate is the right word but yeah, that's probably the best thing I could chalk it up to being somewhat like, and I have a platonic INFJ soulmate. She's much older than me and married to her twin flame, but she can sense whenever I will contact her or what I am feeling. We live miles apart and have a deep level of empathy and understanding towards one another.\n\nAnyways, this suspected ENFJ was complementary in a way, because even when I am feeling extroverted, I'm not like THAT! Like she was. For any ENFJs out there (male or female) struggling to feel valued in a relationship or friendship, I guarantee you plenty of INFPs would love to take you up on either one of those offers. I mean, look at Emma Stone (ENFJ) and Andrew Garfield's (INFP) relationship. They broke up for going their separate paths, but they were probably the most real of the Hollywood celebrity couples and a breath of fresh air to the usual games people like to play. Not saying types are everything, nor that every ENFJ and I would get along, but I think in many cases, you guys are awesome friends, lovers, and people. Keep being you!
2	I wouldn’t guess a person who wants to stand out would be an ENFJ. I feel like I want to conform a lot of the time and build lots of close, intimate connections. That sounds like another personality type to me, maybe ENTP. 
1	Male ENFJ here. INFP-ENFJ relationships are very common. I dated an INFP once. They gravitate towards each other very naturally and there's a lot of chemistry and sensuality. It's also very intense, so often it dies out as quickly as it started. Do a search for INFPs on this sub and you will see just how many have come by. In fact, I have an INFP-ENFJ couple living in the house right next to mine.
7	Do you find INFPs clingy	I've been chatting daily for 2 months with an ENFJ female and we don't live near each other but have plans to meet up in the future. My problem is that I am really into this girl and I fear that I may be coming across as too clingy.  \nI like being affectionate with her. She's assured me that I'm not being clingy and knows that this distance is difficult on me. As hard as I try to distract myself, she is on my mind constantly.  \nHave any of you ever experienced a clingy INFP and if so what was your experience?  \nP.S. I know how clingy this post comes across. Sometimes I wish I could just shut my brain off.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nEdit: After taking y'alls advice I asked her if she would be okay with my barrage of texts without her feeling obligated to reply. She said it was never a problem and to not hold back on messaging her. Thank you guys very much.
7	nope. as a matter of fact, I am probably considered the more clingy one in the relationship.  After the first week of dating my bf (infp), I asked if I could just text him as much as I wanted because I hate waiting to respond because that's the rule of the game typically.  He was fine with it, it was unorthodox because I'd prolly message him hundreds of time in a day lol.  Was refreshing to him though.
5	I'm an INFP in a temporarily long distance relationship who just asked her ENFJ yesterday if he finds me too clingy.... isn't the accuracy of mbti incredibly creepy at times?\nWith that said, do as I say, not as I do and be more confident in who you are! Be yourself! You want someone who likes you for you anyway, so don't second guess yourself (: Some people might find INFPs clingy, but the right people will appreciate you for you
4	ENFJ here. Married to an INFP. ENFJs often don't mind clinginess the way some types do, probably because we can come accross as clingy ourselves, haha. In fact, we usually love attention, especially from people we dig. Best thing to do is be yourself and not stress about her opinion cuz she already likes you, unless she says to stop behaving a certain way. For example, I kept asking my now wife if we were okay. Finally, she had to say,  'yes, please stop asking all the time." While ENFJs don't often mind attention, it's insecurity in others that can be a turn off. Not to cause any more anxiety. More trying to say that you can be who you are with most secure ENFJs and they actually like it. 
2	Not really, one of my good friends is INFP dw about it
2	Honestly I feel like usually I'm the clingy one.
2	I feel like we (ENFJ) are the clingiest of all the types. I'm constantly checking in on friends to make sure they're okay or worrying if they haven't texted in a bit that something's wrong. I definitely wouldn't worry about this.\n\nENFJs tend to put all our effort into making sure others are happy and neglect our own feelings, which leads to countless insecurities.  What you define as "clingy" is what I crave in a relationship. Communicating, being present, telling me how they feel (about me especially).\n\nAnd yeah unlike other types we are extremely honest about our feelings so if you get assurance that it's fine, you can trust it's fine. It's safe to take us at our word. Communicating your concerns will always get you a legitimate response as long as you can turn off the INFP voice telling you not to trust it cause "how could you not be bothered by me when I'm bothered by me."
3	>  She's assured me that I'm not being clingy and knows that this distance is difficult on me.\n\nSo what's the problem?\n\nENFJ male here. INFP's and ENFJ's click very easily. You're not the first INFP/ENFJ matchup that has ever come to /r/ENFJ. In fact, I once dated an INFP myself.\n\nHow clingy you come across should be your least concern.
1	I text her constantly now and I don't wait for a reply. I find that it gets all the thoughts it of my head and it allows me to live in the moment. It's very liberating. Just knowing that she can read my thoughts and know my affection makes me happy.
7	ENFJ.How selective are you in choosing the people you hang out with/your friends?	Within your network of people , do you find yourself sort of actively "pursuing" friendships with those who you feel most compatible with (lifestyle-wise, personality-wise)? Or do you sort of allow friendships to form in a more organic manner with anyone who seems open to the idea of being friends?
12	I’m the opposite of the people that have answered. I tend to actively pursue people that I feel are compatible with me most. Most the time... people naturally gravitate towards me but I really only have a handful of close friends that I feel very close to and in touch with. Genuine people. 
7	Organic. I have very few friends. At least close ones.
3	Both, but I will pursue a new group if I don't enjoy the group around me.
1	I have two best friends and our relationships happened totally naturally. Everyone outside of that trio i feel like i only stay in touch with if I work for it. I get surprised when people are actively making plans with me but when that happens we stay friends. I would say it's hard for me to find people I like, and while I would love to have a big friend group I don't want to waste time with people I don't have anything in common with or who are bad people (they gossip too much, are untrustworthy, are fake, whatever) or who drain me. \nIf I meet someone new that I like and I feel like I need more friends (which is always) then I will actively pursue it. 
1	Male ENFJ here. I do both. People that are compatible with me naturally gravitate towards me and me to them. However, I do also pursue friendships with people who I believe to be compatible. Either way, my network of friends is always changing since I move around very frequently. I have maybe a handful of friends who I still keep in touch with regularly but most others are only close when I'm around them.
1	Male ENFJ here. I tried pusuing those who are not "compatible" with my lifestyle before. It was rather stressful. \n\n
1	I used to make friends in the organic fashion because I enjoyed spending time with different people and go out a lot. As a grow older and become more connected to my professional and academic aspirations, I have found that while I'm able to connect to a lot of different people, a lot of people aren't able to connect to me. I need more out of my close friendships to keep me interested in the long run because I move on if I'm bored. Also, I have always valued genuine, deep and truly thoughtful connections within my friendships, however, I found it very difficult to find but a few who could satisfy these needs. 
1	I value deep genuine friendships. So, I make friends mostly organically, put sometimes "pursue" certain people I feel are compatible with me in some way. I believe friendships can grow and diminish and sometime flat-out just don't work out because of compatibility and that's okay too (often times I still become closer friends after a while, because I keep in touch). Really close friends wise, I have a few I'd trust my life with and that's mutual, but this too grows over time. The only time I try to pursue friendships based on compatibility is when people naturally attract towards me and I have to decide sometimes too, because I don't have time for everyone within my network even though I try.
12	Hello! It is me again, THAT entp!! A while ago I took a survey with all the MBTI types to create an article about how they would want to be asked out. Life got in the way, and I forgot about it until today. It's not perfect, but maybe entertaining. Enjoy!	\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1sIyFAUKxzQSQZVNP87aGEJkuEqpmYHP0sUvYvocxJ5w/edit?usp=sharing
2	Wow that was really interesting! It doesn’t surprise me that the ENTJs where the least cooperative. Lol
1	That was fucking hilarious and very interesting xD. Thanks for that. You put in a lot of effort there and it shows.
1	I love the way you wrote it! Hilarious to read, and thanks for your efforts. I nodded my head to everything in the ENFJ section, and I chuckled at some of the others, comparing the descriptions to other friends I know of the same type.
12	Ambivert ENFJ	Hi! Fellow ENFJ here. Just curious if anyone else is or has had an existential crises like mine! I scored 51% on the extroverted side, just barely made it. Turns out i am VERY strongly Ambiverted. I'm starting to think im introverted by nature and have been nurtured more towards extroversion. It's stupid but it is starting to become a source of insecurity. It's dumb and I hate this ridiculous insecurity, but it's interesting at the very least. Anyone have any related experiences?
4	Yep. I’m also barely “E”. Just roll with it and take time for yourself when you need it :) 
5	It’s pretty normal for ENxx types to be ambiverted! Especially being a 4w5, I had a really hard time deciding between infj and enfj, but I realized that I don’t have that confidence and identity in my thoughts that Ni dominants have, but rather need a lot of affirmation from others because I don’t trust my own opinion on my own (inferior Ti+dominant Fe). 
5	Yes, same here, I usually get slightly to moderately extroverted on the free tests, and from experience, I think the results are accurate.\n\nI do love being around people, but not in large parties or crowds as much as other extroverts, and I do need alone time after 2-3 days straight of socializing in one way or another. I also have mild anxiety when I'm invited to a party where I only know the host and maybe 1-2 others because that means my E side has to work a lot harder at connecting and reading the room.\n\nI strongly suspect being raised an only child contributed to my ambivert-ness.
5	I [ENFJ female] too am barely extroverted. I think our Ni makes us more introverted than a lot of extroverted types. \n\nIt's all good. \n
5	What makes you insecure about it? I'm the same as you, and I consider it one of my most cherished qualities.
3	Male ENFJ here. I'm around 60% extroverted, so I can understand you somewhat. Sometimes I just want to be left alone. That's OK.
3	I have been called a 'reserved extrovert' several times and I'm happy that I, although am loud and it seems like I didn't notice you standing next to me looking at me uncomfortably or frowning stop right there! Don't think I don't take into consideration your feelings because I'll stop and move on to something else. I do, however, wonder how it would be like to go full-on extrovert w/o caring if the group of girls in the corner have something against me or not. Hopefully soon...
2	Same here, I feel when us ENFJ’s mature and we aren’t as big of cry babies we tend to use more Ni 
2	[deleted]
2	I got the exact results from my last MBTI score. I have been consistently ENFJ, but I was going through some things the last time I took the MBTI which could have pushed me towards the introverted side. \n\nThough we are the E type, we ENFJs are more likely to show introverted behavior.
1	Barely an E, but I also like it that way. I can be in spaces with other people whom I love and not have to interact too much with them to get enough E interaction for me. Or I have to interact with new/not as familiar people and my shyness comes out and so sometimes those E interactions are really hard. \n\nMy parents and sister are very much so introverts. I feel introverted by nurture, and then barely e by nature.  
1	Try to do the big five aspect scale like the paid understandmyself or the free IPIP NEO extroversion has many facets and you'll zero in on yours. In those you won't be 50/50.
1	Like another comment said, our Ni can make us Fe dominant ENFJs feel like we’re introverted. I know your relying on the percentage. It’s not anything to worry about. I can talk to everyone, but I’m not bubbly like I use to be. And I’m self reflective and sometimes like to be on my own to do this. \n\nShould we worry about a percentage from a test that is a sliding scale and no wrong or right answer? No\n\nShould we worry if the next moment as extroverts we do something that is introverted? No. You’re only human. We lean on the other side in certain situations. People are not that calculated like robots.\n\nDon’t worry :)
21	ENFJs	Why are you all so cute? (๑>◡<๑)
7	IDK but thanks!
1	Why did i never meet one?
1	Ya' think so? Well. Thanks.
1	Awww. 
1	Hi! Thank you. That’s sweet. :))
6	Feelings for another eNFJ	Hey all, so as the title says, I am an ENFJ male and I have feelings for another ENFJ. \n\nI've been friends with her for a couple of years now, and we've gotten pretty close since then as friends. We both trust each other quite a lot and always talk about our problems to one another. But the thing is I've been wanting to let her know the feelings I have for her, but I'm not sure if she feels the same way about me. I'm afraid that once I tell her, it might makes thing awkward between us, and freeze our relationship. \n\nI'm generally pretty bad at picking up signs if someone does have feelings for me/likes me, so are there any specific signs that could maybe indicate that she likes me too?\nSorry for the long post, but its been on my mind and I just really need some advice.
4	Male ENFJ here. Listen, pal. Relationships always come with that risk. I'm sorry. My advice is that you don't just tell her how you feel but tell her that you want to start a relationship with her and that she's free to refuse. If she refuses, then expect that your friendship will freeze, at least for a while. That's OK. There's a lot of other fish in the sea.
2	There's no way to know unless you ask her
1	Male ENFJ here. I'd weigh your options, because there's no turning back from asking, but definitely have that conversation sometime when you feel comfortable. Sometimes friendships are better. It's hard to tell. So, you'll just have to ask sometime. If she refuses, there might be a few awkward moments and your friendship becomes a choice as well. The best thing to do is to make sure you're both comfortable.
27	I found an INFP!	About two months ago I (ENFJ male) met an INFP female and now I know what the hype is all about!  I’ve never felt so much chemistry and such strong compatibility in my life!  We’ve been inseparable for the past two months.  She’s very receptive to the affection and attention that I give her and she and I frequently have very deep and meaningful conversations.  We share a similar perspective on life but are different in all the right ways.
11	I an INFP male started chatting with an ENFJ female two months ago also. We clicked instantly. We live in separate countries but chat every day. For fun we took the personality test unknowing that we were a match. To me it confirmed what I had been feeling all along. She agrees with most of the ENFJ traits but not the parts about being a leader. I just think it's romantic. Now if I could just get her in my arms.
5	Here check out this couple on YouTube\n\nPrimrose Panglea\nhttps://youtu.be/p1a28cWDi48\nENFJ (m) and INFP (f)\n\nThey are my couple goals.... as an INFP they sound like my dream relationship when I watch them 😂 I used to brush off this stuff about mbti and compatibility but when I see these two I’m wow’d
3	I’m in love with an INFP girl and she is amazing so I know exactly what you’re talking about! Her and I have such deep conversations and can talk for hours. It’s really one of the best things ever
3	I'm an INFP with her very own ENFJ - welcome!! It's like freaking magic. Is this what soulmates is? 
2	ENFJ here. About two years ago I clicked with an INFP. It was a very intense and short-lived experience. At that time I was 25 and she was just about to turn 18, so it didn't work out. This experience just confirmed to me what I always knew, namely that INFP's are a very good match for ENFJ's.\n\nNow I am happily married to an ISFJ, so that works out just as well.
2	Your INFP is very lucky
2	am infp female and can confirm going strong 3 months with an enfj male. it's so surreal
1	I have an enfj friend, sometimes talking about going into the wild to live in isolation because he feels he sacrifices too much of himself for the comfort of others and he doesn't really see an option to confront these things and change his behavior, he would rather have it that he has some universal human experience that he can't fix while living in human society.
4	How often do you write cards/letters to people. If so, is it just out of courtesy (Bday,Xmas) or is because the person is special to you?	As an INFP, I love writting letters! I put a lot of effort and time in writing the right words for the special people. I was just wondering how is this for ENFJs. Thanks!
2	ENFJ here. I think that NF's enjoy writing letters in general. Years ago I dated an INFP who loved writing letters. I haven't written letters for years because I don't have anyone to write them to. I kind of get my dose of letter writing through emailing. It's what the kids do these days, I guess...\n\nEither way, I have a number of friends who I try to keep in touch with on a regular basis, which is weekly. I use social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp...).
2	As for actual cards and letters, I’d only do that for a romantic interest. I don’t send cards in general unless that person is special to me. 
1	I have begun to write letters/cards more often, maybe due to some fatigue from everything being electronic these days, but I never stopped since I learned how to address an envelope. I usually don't send them via mail unless it's for Christmas.\n\nI still email/IM/text as main modes of communication, but sometimes it's nice to write and send physical mail.
10	As an ENFJ, I'm kind of tired constantly being referred to as the 'delicate' type	Just tired in general of all the stereotypes, also I hope Y'all have a nice day wherever you are! :)\nedit: I take that back
7	Lol enfjs are far from delicate. I know I am
4	INFJ here with an ENFJ partner. Just came here to say that my ENFJ is NOT 'delicate'. He is actually one of the most strong willed, headstrong, and determined people I know. He has been through so much shit in his life and he just keeps on trucking with a smile on his face and a pep in his step. He brings this light to the people around him as well.\n\nYes, he's emotionally really sensitive but that does not make someone a weak or'delicate' person... If anything I think it adds to his strength. 
5	'Sensitive' might be the more appropriate term they should use. 'Delicate' seems to conote fragility, whereas sensitivity is a strength.\n\nMaybe those people who label us 'delicate' are just insensitive, so they have a different baseline for their point of view.
3	ENFJ here. I don't consider myself delicate at all. I do, however, have buttons that when pressed will trigger a swift and intense response...
2	If I'm correct in assessing which of my friends are ENFJs, then they are far from delicate.  They may hold an irrational grudge where they don't even remember why they were mad at someone, and then years later decide "hey, I don't even remember why we were fighting anymore, wanna make up?"  Anyone else: "Umm, we were fighting??"  Hey that's subconscious Fi in the 5th position for you.
2	I thought ENFJs were the strong willed ones.  INFJs may appear delicate but they really are not delicate.
4	ENFJ friend going through quarter life crises	My ENFJ friend recently went through identity crises and stopped talking to everybody. She decides to call off her marriage and says "It was not meant to be, but we are good friends" Is there a way I can help her?
10	People with enfj personalities are prone to identity turbulence and disruptions. We want multiple things that are potentially at odds with each other. We are also strong feeling types who see the world through an emotional lens and have a tendency to become overwhelmed by them. My estimation your friend is in all likelihood going through a period of reflection that may be triggered by certain stressful thoughts, the feeling of being out of control and wanting to recreate herself. This involves letting the old part of her personality fade away. Isolation is usually a response to being overwhelmed by others telling her what to do, or how to feel. All we need at these times is an empathetic friend who can truly feel what we are feeling without judgment. But we also need a mentor, someone who can guide us to figuring out a plan. It's the lack of a plan and guidance that keeps us isolated longer than needed. But the person giving guidance has to be someone we can truly respect, we can usually see through people who are faking empathy, or trying to control our behavior (even well-intentioned), or only have a limited supply of empathy that we might overwhelm them too. Not everyone can do this. Therefore people should give what they can, your friend can and will likely figure it out by her self eventually. They may only be able to trust a handful of people right now.   
2	ENFJ here. I don't know what's happening in her life but I had a similar experience a few years ago:\n\nI was very dissatisfied with a relationship that I had. I was to get married in 8 weeks but broke up. And not only did I break up with my fiancé at that time but I also cut off contact with everyone (except my parents and siblings), moved to the USA, and stayed out of touch for about two years.\n\nBest decision I've ever made.\n\nNow I am happily married and doing what I like.\n\nENFJ's sometimes need a radical retirement to reassess their priorities and goals in life.
12	Whatever shall we call you?	Also, why are all the words auto-capped in the title?\n\nOh, whatever! Hi folks, I'm just your friendly worldwide ENTP chiming in to find out what the everloving eff you would like the rest of the world to call you as a group. *ahem* That is, I've been sent on a quest by my less proactive cohorts in r/ENTP to find out what to call groups of everyone.\n\nTo date, we've agreed upon being called a Chaos on r/ENTP. INTJs have selected a Jury by popular vote, and ENTJs have executively chosen to be referred to as a Command.\n\nNow it is your turn. I shall wait in terror ^I ^mean ^curiosity!!\n\n*edit* Why do the words auto-cap and then NOT auto-cap upon publishing? What kind of magic is this!?
10	Asked my INTJ friend and he says "A den, because you're all about community and closeness."\n\nI think that's an absolutely AMAZING idea, so my vote goes to "a den of ENFJs"!\n\nThoughts, anyone? 
5	I kinda like the idea of being collectively referred to as a "council".  Kind of like a council of elders, guiding and nurturing.  Also has a bit of a double entendre with "counsel", which we do oh so well.
3	ENFJ here. I'd agree with /u/_G_U_C_C_I_ that we are natural born *Leader's*, though contrary to ENTJ's, we're *Sensitive Leaders* because we lead by empathy, cooperation, mutual understanding, emotional intelligence, whereas ENTJ's lead by power, strength, competition, and persistence.
2	Hmm, here's some ideas: a Parade, a Romp, a Party, a Charm :-)
2	A Congregation?
2	A school of ENFJs - we like to teach and be taught. The role models and the carers, but not in a ESFJ kind of way.
1	For the ENFJs, one of the odes to Darkwing Duck.
1	Gaggle sounds funny,  but den does sound apt! As an ENFJ I'm always torn between funny and apt...
1	ENFJ: Complex Rainbows or Thoughtful Leaders since we're usually referred to as natural born leaders for the most part. And what's up with 'Chaos'? Like how 'chaotic' are you guys?
6	Confused INTP in a relationship	Hi guys, first of all, happy new year to all of you !\n\nI (20F) am an INTP who recently got in a relationship with a (20M) ENFJ, and would like your opinion on a couple questions\n\nThe (+) of our relationship :\n\nHe's really motivating, outgoing, and a genuinely good person who strives to become better, and wants to make others become the best versions of themselves too. We've been friends for 2 years before we started dating, and he had a huge impact on my life very fast. He's one of the only persons with whom I can talk about deep existential questions, as well as superficial small talk.\nI can be very shy and reserved, but now I want to help those who I am close to, I want to try new things, get out of my comfort zone more often, etc.\nI'm also in love for the 1st time.\n\nThe (-) of our relationship :\n\nHe alternates between being very loving and an absolute supportive sweetheart, and being a lone wolf who wants to help everyone, give as much love as he can, but he seems quite unable to receive any without thinking of himself as selfish. He has massive, Trump-fantasy-sized walls around his heart. \nHe dumped me briefly before coming back, because he thought he'd rather have me as a best friend than a lover.\nI'm confused, sometimes I'm "wifey material", and sometimes I'm just a best homie.\n\nOverall :\n\nI know it's only the beginning, but our relationship feels a bit one sided for now. I want to provide as much positivity as I can, but I also feel like he's much more accomplished than I am, and I doubt I have anything to offer.\nI want to give as much love as I can to him, but I don't want to make him uncomfortable.\n\nI'd like to hear your insight, and thank you if you took the time to read all this !
3	It sounds like he may have an Avoidant attachment style, if he is unwilling to receive love and has massive walls around his heart. I'd recommend having a look at this article to learn more: https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/compassion-matters/201307/how-your-attachment-style-impacts-your-relationship\n\nIf you have a Secure attachment style, there's a good chance things might work out between you - as long as he is willing to actively work on his attachment issues. (e.g. seeing a therapist, reading books, etc.) If you have an Anxious-Preoccupied attachment style, this relationship will probably be quite damaging for you, so I would recommend finding someone Secure instead.
2	First thing I’d like to comment on is how you said he’s more accomplished than you. I’m an ENFJ male who’s been crushing on an INFP for a while now and she says the same thing about me. Don’t ever feel like you’re not good enough for us or anything of the sort. We don’t look at people for their accomplishments. We love passionate and genuine people who are unapologetically themselves :)\n\nAnd the thing about how you’re his homie and then he’s into you romantically - I kind of fall on that too. I can’t really explain why do that sometimes, but it’s nothing to really think too much about. We’re chameleons and adapt to people’s personalities so he that could just be how he is. Give him affection and some touches and here and there to set it to that romance side.\n\nHe probably dumped you because he was afraid of his capability to give you that 100% dedication he thinks you deserve. It’s a whole “it’s me not you” thing. \n\nLastly, yes about the guilt thing. Be gentle with him and take initiative into helping but be casual about it. Don’t give him the chance for the help to whirl around his mind and for him to over complicate a simple gesture. \n\nWe think we have to save everyone and this strong will makes us a bit temperamental when it comes to asking for help. I know that I get scared of it but we just don’t want to be a bother to anyone despite the good intentions. \n
1	Check out the Love Languages. It's admirable that you want to give him love, but make sure that it's done in a way that he will appreciate. You are valuable for your rational thinking and quirky humour.  He will learn how to accept love, but right now he probably doesn't think he's worthy of it, or you.\n\nDon't wait for him. Things will work out if they're meant to, but don't let your loyalty allow you to be walked over. Be as open and honest as you can - I appreciate people being upfront about their thoughts and feelings.
0	ENFJ's when unhealthy tend to walk all over you but that's like the extremely unhealthy side of an ENFJ, which every ENFJ fears it since it may contradict their purpose. But hey every ENFJ is different just different things that bind us all together
17	A fellow INFP passing by and wishing you a happy new year, you wonderful beings! <3	I met one of you last month and I was overwhelmed by you guys. Keep giving a spark of life in a world we gave up time ago. Don't drink too much and get a good night's rest.
2	'one of you' hah I laugh at that...
1	Happy New Year! Try to find the silver linings! 😁
16	Happy New Year 2018 Fellow ENFJ's!	ENFJ here: Just wanted to wish you all a happy new year 2018.\n\nLet's continue to make the world a better place!
2	Happy New Year's to you too! :)
2	Happy New Year!!😁🤗🍾🍻🥂🎉
8	Any other ENFJs setting themselves up for a Proactive 2018?	In spite of an emotionally turbulent fall quarter for myself, I’ve managed to get my 4th consecutive internship starting in January while studying full time as a college student. My mentor also nominated me for a undergraduate student recognition award at my school.\n\nI wasn’t expecting to be nominated and I always have a tough time being receptive of these kinds of things (suffered from an imposter syndrome the first 2 years of college). So on the morning I got the email, I got teary eyed on my commute to my fall quarter internship. I’m sure I made it awkward for some people on the bus (I was crying tears of joy).\n\nI’m really thankful that I’ve got things to look forward to in the new year and I was curious if any other ENFJs wanted to share anything they’ve done to set themselves up for a proactive 2018. 
4	Hmmm... Well, I'm working hard on keeping a bakery running and starting a farming business (maybe). I'm also working on a new book. Guess I am setting myself up for a proactive 2018?
2	I finally finished my degree, so moving overseas to work/travel 😊
1	I had a very rough semester recently but I’ve given some time to reflect and realized the flaws of what led to the mess. I gave myself to people to often and sacrificed time for myself while also being too distracted in my own over complicated thoughts.\n\nFrom now on, I’m keeping a journal where I will write 3 things I want to accomplish each day and will set aside 10 mins of mediation each day while also asking myself what my goal is to reaffirm my passions in medicine
25	An ENFJ as a kid	Scene: *two kids playing*\n\nENFJ: *playing with favorite toy*\n\nOther kid: "I wanted to play with that one!"\n\nENFJ: "But don't you want to play with this one?" (tries tactic number 1: manipulate them into thinking that they want a different toy) \n\nOther kid: "No, I want thaaat one!" \n\nENFJ: "We could take turns." (tries tactic number 2: make everyone happy) \n\nOther kid: "Nooo! I want thaaat one!" \n\nENFJ: "Okay, you can play with it! Here you go." (ends up using tactic number 3: make everyone else happy) \n\nEnd of scene. \n\n\nThis was me as a kid. Can any other ENFJs relate to this? \nWhat are some "scenes" you recall happening over and over growing up? \n\n\n\n\n
17	As a kid, my mother would probably describe me as “the heroine that steps up when it’s absolutely none of her business.” \n\nI was stupidly confrontational against bullies, for the underdogs. Still am today, but I pick my battles carefully...\n\nI will never forget kindergarten, where I had to protect a shy friend of mine from being PINCHED constantly by another female class bully. Kids can honestly be so terrible!
11	Totally relate!\n\nAnother scenario for me was getting trapped in fights between friends. \n\nFriend 1: Friend 2 is so mean!\nMe (M): yes she is! (Empathizing and mimicking to give the speaker what she wants to hear)\n\nLater...\n\nFriend 2: Friend 1 is so mean!\nMe (M): yes she is!\n\nLater...\n\nFriend 1: Friend 2 just told me you think I’m mean! I only like Friend 2 now because she tells me the truth!\n\nFriend 2: Friend 1 just told me you think I’m mean! You aren’t my friend anymore. I only like Friend 1. \n\nMe: Stay silent and eat lunch alone and say nothing. 
6	1) Visits the ENFJ reddit forum during Christmas when it is cold out.\n\n2) Aww, reading someones ENFJ post.\n\n3) Is filled with all the *FEELS* at someone ENFJ post...it is so apt.\n\n4) Suddenly misses his ENFJ ex, even though they haven't dated for years.
2	I wasn't like either of these scenarios as a child hmm
2	Oh if I were at your place I would make the toy seem boring, not cool or anything until they dont want it. "sure but.. my bro once peed on it (with disgusted face)" as long no lies LOL. But JK I probably let people play them. An ENFJ, after all.\n\n\nI don't really recall the detail of the scenes, but I'm more like a justice-like person always stand up for people being bullied. Or probably become their second parent and not sorry for it. Or consult the one who's consulting me. Overly dramatic, very dramatic. I don't like it to be honest.\n\nAnyway instead of scene.. I've these repeated thought. After awhile making new friends I always think of this "they're different than who they were months / year ago. But I like it, now they all behave and think the way I want. And they even seem happy to be like that too". Yea this one
2	ENFJ here. I was like that. I used to give my school lunch to kids who had none. Some of them would come to me every morning and just take it out of habit. My mother got wind of it and beat me up. Decades later she told me that she always felt that I was “a child like this” (she said that in a demeaning tone of voice), hinting at the fact that I was always an ENFJ (and that she doesn't like those, though she obviously has never heard about the concept).
2	Saw this on twitter and it reminded me of this post.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/AMAZlNGNATURE/status/949208764128706561\n
2	I used to bully other kids and manipulate them, I guess I've matured
6	Making others happy	How do you guys know you aren't compromising yourself for the sake of peace? I always want to make everyone else happy and find happiness in doing so, but how do you distinguish whether it's actually detrimental to your identity? How do you know you aren't compromising yourself for the better of the relationship?
6	When you have that gut feeling that you are not being your authentic self. 
3	ENFJ here. I used to be told that I can't please everybody. That was one of the hardest lessons for me to learn. Nowadays I only go so far before I draw boundaries.
2	I get those thoughts baking Christmas cookies. I used to mail them to all family and bring them to all get togethers. Last year I felt I left friends out, and mailed them, too! MI to AK...\n\nThen this year I thought, "If I wasn't going to that party, no one sent a thank you card last year (benchmark for a truly touching gift in my opinion), and I missed three people last year who didn't mention it to me or gossip about it, would I really want to spent 18 hours today making 70 dozen cookies?" The answer was no. I made 10 dozen and the parties actually got rescheduled for tomorrow (and the cookies would have gone bad).\n\nAnd today I am not baking.
2	Principle, in my case is my religion is what I live up to. It does taught me what is ok and not ok to do in order to make people happy so I’m following to that rules. If I disobey? I still believe it’s me. But the me i resent to be and I will turn back into the me I want to be. Things arent complicated when you clearly know the purpose of your life. 
2	>I always want to make everyone else happy and find happiness in doing so, but how do you distinguish whether it's actually detrimental to your identity?\n\nRemember to pritotize your needs first before you help others. Don’t lose yourself in other people’s problems. It’s honestly a slippery slope if you find happiness by giving it to others first because you won’t know how people will react to the help. You can’t help people If you won’t help yourself.\n\nMy advice if you find it apart of your identify? Find a local non-profit that aligns with your passions and volunteer with them. I’ve been volunteering at a museum for almost 4 years now and its been a rewarding experience (ALSO FREE FOOD WOHOO!).\n\n>How do you know you aren't compromising yourself for the better of the relationship?\n\nIf the other person isn’t willing to put equal effort into the relationship. Don’t waste your time on others who won’t reciprocate the effort you put in. Your time is valuable and it shouldn’t be taken advantage of, so drop anyone who doesn’t value the work you do.
2	Try to gradually identify which types of compromises you consider justified, and which go too far. Over time you can build up a pretty good base of self-knowledge on such matters. And if you have trouble deciding on a particular type of compromise whether it's going too far, ask a few people whose values and judgement you trust, and you'll have more input for making your decision.
3	unpopular opinion	I much prefer ENFP men over INFP men (for both friendships and romantic relationships, but I'm talking about specifically the latter.)
14	To add on to yours, on a related note, these are my unpopular opinions:\n\n* **Any type can work with any type.** Relationship compatibility theories are horse shit. ENFJxINFP, ENFPxINTJ and whatever other pairing are all overhyped and the people who speak loudest about it are only the successful ones.\n\n* **On its own, MBTI means little to nothing in the real world.** You have someone’s Enneagram type, upbringing, culture, gender, preferences, illnesses, age, religion, whatever.\n\n* **Case in point: every goddamn ENFJ on here is different as fuck.** Sure, some things bind us, but like every other type and people in general, people are not generalisable!!\n\n* **I hate how people use MBTI to justify hatred than bridge differences.** I don’t know how you can dislike/ hate an entire type taking into account that we’re all different people.\n\n* **I hate how people use MBTI to divide than to unite.** Fuck people who do that. The longer I am on MBTI forums, the more I detest it. I notice that the older users who used to post on here no longer do and I completely understand why.\n\n* **Personality theories only encourage people to stop seeing people as people.** People without self-awareness should shy far away from it.
2	I'm an ENFP woman and my best friend is an ENFJ lady... I would love to date an ENFJ one day!
2	So do you flip a coin when ever you two can't decide as a group on who is to lead at this moment, or do you enjoy letting the other person win / decide?
3	Advice pls!	Background: I've been with my enfj partner for more than 7 years and I would like to travel overseas by myself for a few weeks. There's absolutely no reason why I couldn't do this except he interprets this as a sign that I don't like being around him or that it's too dangerous. For context, he knows I'm an introvert and he knows I like having my alone time. I'm also pretty confident I can take care of myself. Any way I can convince him to 'let' me travel?\n\nThanks in advance :)
3	As an ENFJ..\n\n- *Prove* that you can protect yourself - tell or show him if you've learnt a lot about travelling, martial arts, have went to many places before. If he were to ask about certain dangerous situations, answer to him convincingly how you'll handle that situation.\n\n- *Prove* the place you're going is safe for you - either by news or people's talk such as family, friend or someone he respects, adore or idolize, website he trusts the most etc.\n\n- *Tell* how travelling can make you happy, but how his permission make you the happiest - Explain the detail, what fascinates you, this is what you've been dreaming for and having his permission will make you the happiest person.\n\n- *Assure* him that you're going to keep in touch - give him fact that the network there will work, what time you'll contact him, can he contact you whenever etc. If making it public will make him trust you more, then do it. Such as update on FB.. that you're going to update on your FB status or whatsapp group of screenshot of you and him video call when you reach there. Using public people as witnesses of your promise, (but you don't have to let them know it's to make him believe you) so higher chance is you're not gonna break it.\n\n- *Tell* him the detail of your travelling plan - part of what ENFJ does before travelling, can be seen as you're well prepared for what you're going to do.\n\n- *Make* him imagine that you'll be able to return back safely - promise to buy certain gifts he likes or tell him you can't wait to post your travelling pictures.\n\n\n- *Emotional* - "I always believe in you, please trust me on this one plss?" with puppy eyes haha. Are you an INFP by any chance?\n\n- *Reward* - What would you give him back in return if he 'let' you go? You know what I mean ;)\n\nTone - Relaxing, happy.\n\nIf he's suddenly so stubborn and get into fight - Cry (looll) and tell how much you love him and want him to make you happy by believing in you. Don't place too much guilty on him, make him feel like his permission can make you happy instead.
2	As an ENFJ I understand the too dangerous aspect, but the not being around him is insecurity that has no place "personally" in my thinking. Every bird will fledge, explain to him that all the years of being with an ENFJ has rubbed off on you. All you are trying to do is spread your INFJ wings flying into something uncomfortable. This is something any spouse should support. 
1	As an ENFJ, I'm instantly thinking of if my INTP husband said the same thing to me and how I would react. \n\nSeeing the world and traveling is a very spiritual and emotional experience for most people. For ENFJs, we want to experience those things with other people. Even if we "know" other people like to experience these things alone, we still "feel" like if we were there with them, it would enrich the experience. \n\nI know for myself I would probably be thinking that traveling by yourself would be my partners way of saying I don't improve his life, and that would be very insulting and mind-shattering for me. It would feel like my purpose in life was in vain. \n\nHopefully that can help you get some insight into your partner's POV! Good luck!
9	I wanna know more about ENFJs!	ENFP here. I’ve been pretty into Mbti for about a year now and know a lot about all of the types...except for ENFJs. I mean, I know about them on paper, but I can’t think of anyone in my real life who is an ENFJ and I feel like no one ever talks about ENFJs in r/mbti. So I have a few questions:\n\nWhat type(s) are you usually very attracted to?\n\nWhat makes you tick (feel angry, sad,etc.)?\n\nWhat do you think is the most unique thing about your type? (Is that a bad question I can’t tell lol)\n\n\nFeel free to answer all of these or just 1 or 2. But either way, I wanna know more so share away!
7	Hm, well to answer your first question, I really don't have a specific type of a guy or a specific MBTI type. What I need is to be accepted though. Also, I tend to be really motherly (or rather wifey?) in a sense, I like to care for the other person, give him little presents, cook for him etc so when other person doesn't recognize that or is annoyed by that or finds it unnecessary or is totally indifferent towards it something inside me really breaks even though I wouldn't really be able to admit since I would blame it on myself, telling to myself that it's my fault for being overly needy. I would really feel like being pushed away and unwanted. Also I tend to fall for really masculine guys, and by that I mean dominant in every sense pretty much. That doesn't mean being abusive and controlling though, but rather assertive. To put it simple - with men I like being in the passenger seat and feel like a woman. That's the main problem I have with INFPs, I think. Numerous MBTI charts claim that ENFJs and INFPs are a perfect match, but for me personally that can't be further from the truth. I had one INFP being interested in me and I just didn't feel any attraction. I found him too sensitive and childlike and like his head was in the clouds way too much. And same goes with the female INFPs I know (for example, my own mother). Hm, maybe I do have "my type" after all.\n\nWhat makes me sad, angry etc? Probably being outcasted and not accepted. With years I closed myself a bit, a lot of stuff took a tool on me. I was not accepted in the middle school at all, and I remember being needy and clingy at times, probably because of desperation, wanting not to be lonely and unaccepted. Now I'm a bit restrained, still confused how to show love and not to be clingy / needy / annoying so I tend to keep it to myself. But yeah, being pushed away probably hurts the most. And also perceiving me insincere.\n\nWith all that being said, I actually am not sure how it all adds up for me just being ENFJ and how much is it just having to do with me personally. 
5	Im an ENFJ girl. I typically choose louder, popular, dominant and masculine guys. However, I need them to have this (private?) side of them that is extremely creative and imaginative but they feel no need to show off that side to anyone but their close friends and their S/O, me. I love guys who are very humble but not reserved, which is hard to find. \nI really like men who appreciate what I do for them, because I give and care so much and when someone is grateful for that it just makes me melt. Guys who are smiley and caring but still very masculine just totally sweep me off my feet. \nThat being said, I love the energy and positivity of ENFPs, the energy and intelligence of ENTPs, ENTJs are fucking awesome, ESTPs and ESTJs are too rude and shallow but i generally connect with them on a superficial level and/or they are very physically attractive to me. Other than that i don't really know what the perfect type is for me because i don't know all the types super well. But I gave you what I knew. \nI get really depressed when I feel lonely or unaccepted by a group. I get antsy when Im around stupid or boring people for too long. I love surrounding myself with people that inspire me and show me new things, and who offer different perspectives. It drives me nuts when people are inconsiderate or rude, I have little patience for people not caring about how their actions affect others. When people finally are thoughtful and mindful about my or other's emotions and well being, I just have the utmost respect and admiration for them and I want to be around them all the time. \nI love tradition and family, I love common sense, I like abstract comic books and sci fi shit, I like weird science and learning about stuff that has no relevance to my life but is still super fucking awesome, i like baking and baths and cuddles and sewing and books and drawing. It drains me when people aren't supportive of me or my needs, or when they are discouraging or things that I have interest in or passion for. When this happens I tend to seclude myself with the aforementioned physical comforts and try not to think about my loneliness. Yes, this thought pattern has led to many years of depression. Yes, it is getting better, but it's hard when your happiness depends on the approval of others. 
3	ENFJ girl here.  I do like my sensitive INFPs, but overall I don't really go after a specific type. I was open to dating anyone that shared the same interests as me. \n\nMy current partner is INFP though, and he's wonderful.  I focus more on someone who is stable and loyal.  He's probably the only partner I've had that I share great conflict resolution with.  We literally talk it out so well that we never go to bed mad at each other.  I'm attracted to nerds who are open minded and share their thoughts and feelings with me.  I think as long as they are willing to work with me through all the big obstacles ahead of us, then they are worth while people.\n\nWhat pisses me off is insincerity.  Don't really like people who are fake and try to manipulate to get something out of me.  I don't appreciate lies and people who try to shove their thoughts down other people's throats.  Don't like people who resort to name calling when there's a debate.  Don't like being told what I already know, or being question on things I do know.  \n\nUnique thing about my type...I think we are generally very supportive people who can empathize well.  Typically easy to open others up to us and share our experiences.
2	- *For* a platonic relationship (as a male and female) would be all type.\n\n- *For* a non platonic relationship (as a heterosexual female) all but usually mid-extrovert and ENFJ the most. I like having an opened, responsible, funny, knows-when-to-get-serious gentleman ENFJ. They're like my dream man.\n\n- *For* a non platonic relationship (as a heterosexual male) all but usually very-introvert. I like being able to open up someone whose door is tightly closed. I like to tease them.. and make them mine. lol\n\n\n- *What* makes me angry ; Unjustice, practical joke in general (tho I'm ok with JFL for most parts), people who don't want to defend themselves from harm, people who decide negativity surround them, impolite and rudeness.\n\n- *What* makes me sad ; Underappreciated.\n\nUnique thing about ENFJ I've seen from my experience which doesn't necessarily represent entire ENFJ in the world - excellently influence and persuade people to do even the most ridiculous, harmful and insane things and yet still have them love and addicted with the ENFJ. Tho ENFJ I know are most likely not going to do that for bad purpose.\n
2	> What type(s) are you usually very attracted to?\n\nI'm not very familiar with the other types but INFP seems to be a consensus around here.\n\n\n \n> What makes you tick (feel angry, sad,etc.)?\n\nVery little irks me. Flakiness (I don't care if you're late just fucking tell me you're gonna be late). People not being honest or open. People not taking responsibility. Also chewing sounds but that's cause I have misophonia.\n\nWhat makes me sad? When other people are sad. I just want everyone to be happy dammit. I have a lot of mental illness issues and I hate seeing everyone be miserable because they think they deserve it. Only I deserve it! You all should be happy and I'll do my best to make sure you are.\n\n\n \n> What do you think is the most unique thing about your type?\n\nAgain don't know the other types very well but it seems like everyone is drawn to us cause we focus nearly 100% of our energy on making other people happy or helping them with their problems. It makes us seem selfless even though (at least for me) I draw my energy from helping others so there's a selfish component. Plus why deal with my own issues, which are hard, when I can help you deal with yours?
1	They are fictional ENFJs but if you could ask CJ Cregg or Abigail Bartlet from the west wing questions what would you ask?
1	ENFJ girl. \n\nI like ESFJ, INFP, ESFP, INTJ personalities. I find ENFP, ESTP, ISFJ, INTP personalities to be the ones I typically do not get along with. Also for some reason I don’t get along with an ENFJ. The ENFJ I know is a pretty obnoxious person to be around. He’s done a bunch of bad things and still likes to criticize other people it’s insane. And too much of a SJW it’s pretty annoying (we could be talking about our day. And he will bring up how much he hates Trump). For an FYI I am not a political person at all. I don’t care about that stuff. I like conspiracy theories. I also know another SJW ENFJ on this Facebook group I’m part of and she’s pretty annoying and obnoxious too. \n\nI hope all ENFJs aren’t like this lol. 
1	I am attracted to INF's mostly, though ISF's also work. They must be I and F at least. Anything else is a no-go.\n\nI passionately hate anything that has a T and avoid such people as much as I can.\n\nCompetition makes me very angry.\n\nThe unique thing about my type is how I can predict people's behavior and draw out their potential.
3	Relationships type compatibility according to answers on OkCupid	Male 1 (INTP) was matched with female 1 (INFJ), for example, then the resulting match percentage (how much of what the INTP male wants is given by the INFJ female) was stored in the ("m:intp", "f:infj") bucket. Then the reverse happened, and it was stored in the ("f:infj", "m:intp") bucket. Once everyone was matched with everyone else, the values in each bucket were averaged together. Once averaged, the average and standard deviation for the ("m:intp", ...) results were calculated, for example, then used to normalize those results. Once normalized, the lower of ("m:intp", "f:infj") and ("f:infj, "m:intp") was stored as the match percentage for that type and gender.\n\nENFJ Male: https://i.imgur.com/8IncCfy.png\n\nENFJ Female: https://i.imgur.com/e4ZVRZY.png\n\nSource: http://forums.intpcomplex.com/showthread.php?4036-Type-compatibility-(according-to-answers-on-OkCupid)
1	Thanks for this, so interesting!
3	how do I text you as a teen?	Hi, i want to send a text to an ENFJ (f) I'm (m) over the break to stay in touch, but i dont want it to seem like im hitting on them. How do I do this?\n\n
4	ENFJ teen here, \nI’d say send them something about a common interest. A link to a video, article, or something like that so there is a given topic of convo. I’m much less likely to read that as “romantic”. 
2	Say hi and ask to go for coffee together after the break
0	ENFJ here.\n\nGood luck. With that.\n\nIf you were a female, she'd take it as a friend checking on her. But since you're male, she'll always think that something's odd. If you want to hit on her, there's no shame in texting her. She'll let you know that she has no interest.
55	Hi ENFJ subreddit don't mind me I'm just a friendly ENFP strolling by saying hi and dropping off a little pool of RAINBOWS and SUNSHINE because I think you guys are cool ok bye😀	
8	Right back at ya 😉 🌈
6	Hey ENFP! You’re wonderful, have a lovely rest of the year!!!
6	Agh just take my upvote already! Gosh, how easy is it to flatter us...? Now get out ya lovely ENFP
2	Is this Maggie by any chance? Or just a different lovely ENFP?
2	we think you're cool too we love youuuyu 😍😊
1	Hugs!
1	xoxo
1	Hi I like your rainbow, just want to know if you're here to get upvote for fun :P
1	I'm an ENFP with an ENFJ best friend and she's awesome. 
2	INFP curious to interact with ENFJs and ENTJs	I just took the test and found out I'm an INFP woman. I read that ENJFs and ENTJs get along best with each other and I wanted to put it to the test. Share if you're at ENJF or and ENTJ and share a bit about yourself and what makes you tick ;)
2	Male ENFJ here, married to an ISFJ.\n\n> I read that ENJFs and ENTJs get along best with each other...\n\nI know the opposite to be true. I need a lot of self-control to tolerate anything that is T. It's very difficult for us. T's tend to have low emotional intelligence, which is one of the things that makes us tick.\n\nAs an ENFJ I like to have many friends and be able to talk to them when I feel like it.\n\nI like to brainstorm ideas for creative projects with a focus on humanities.\n\nI value cooperation very much.\n\nI like structure, order, predictability, and I dislike loose ends or cliffhangers.\n\nTalk to me about issues that relate to social justice, emotions, how to organize a project or team, and praise my sense of morality. That's how you'll get to me.
1	Not sure how to comment tho because I’m an ENFJ but is an ENTJ at work. I dont know any ENTJ other than me. \n\n\n-From my ENFJ views towards my ENTJ, ENTJ is pretty cold, insensitive and makes a charming robotic boss lol. ENTJ makes a good conversation, excellent strategy and all about progress. Can’t compliment enough of how cool ENTJ is at work. The enthusiasm to work under pressure, whew it feels too satisfying. But well.. again it lacks interaction of emotion. I notice that when im on ENTJ mode I often settle off people’s personal problem more for the sake of “lets settle it down so u can start working again”, rather than “let me help you because you are special” enfj thing. Ofc there is nothing wrong with it but my ENFJ disagrees.also i went into disastrous relationship with my INFP. Like seriously disastrous. I nearly give up until my ENFJ came to save me. Now I love her more than ever lol.\n\n\n\n-Now as ENTJ, ENFJ sometimes can be too.. emotional. They are easily burdened by everyone’s emotional problem and slows them down from doing work. At least its from my experience. Not only that.. they can be a bit manipulative too. If it can stop being dramatic then im all good. What i like about ENFJ co workers is they’re harmonious people. They easily get everyone calm and I’m all there just to watch them do it in a few seconds, make everybody emotionally happy (which is a hassle for me) then I can start my meeting.\n\n\n\n-Overall they both are good, but I prefer ENFJ more. I do notice when in meeting or so, speech as ENFJ is more persuasive and mesmerizing than my ENTJ’s. People seems they love and obey willingly my ENFJ more. But surely my ENTJ helps me a lot in making better decision at work, you know money loll. Being ENTJ makes stuff so strategic and well done. Glad I can be both
12	Merry Christmas, beautiful people <3	May God and His peace find a home in your hearts, and may your New year be filled with joy and love. I love you all. 
3	Merry Christmas and happy holidays! 
2	Merry Christmas ENFJ people 💗
4	Any ENFJ-ISTP relationship experience here?	I am ENFJ, F and my long term relationship with my ISTP bf ended recently. I have seen a couple of cases where ENFJ-ISTP relationships ended not so well. Does this pairing ever work? I find myself often making great friends with ISTPs
5	My parents are a great example of a marriage that works between ENFJ and ISTP. My dad is the ENFJ and my mom the ISTP. I think one of the pitfalls of these types together is the ENFJ not letting the ISTP have alone time and sometimes can get offended by the alone time ISTPs need. Also, my mom has to bring my dad back down to earth on a lot of things cause he tends to be a dreamer. It can work but through patience and understanding for each person.
1	I am in such a relationship, but with the genders reversed. I still can't say if it works, since we're only 3 months in, but being very different it does take maturity to make it work.  \nCurious to know what made your relationship end...
1	I’m an ENFJ (f) in a relationship with an ISTP (m) and it’s difficult, to say the least. The hardest thing for me is that his emotional intelligence isn’t at the same level as mine, and it is so hard for me to talk to him about feelings/emotions because he just doesn’t understand. \nBeing completely opposite from one another makes fighting/discussions really hard, especially because he is so hard headed and because I feel very deeply and strongly about what we are usually fighting/discussing. \nAt the end of the day, we both have to have the maturity to see the other side, and to respect one another enough to find some common ground. \nWe’ve almost broken up a few times, and I often question if it will work out, since we are so different.\nI also am curious as to why your relationship ended. Regardless, breakups are never easy — be strong, and take care of yourself. 💕
1	I am a ENFJ female (24 y/o) who has been in a relationship with an ESTP male (26 y/o) for two years. I often worry we will not work out in the long run. There have been times where our differences have caused one of us to want to throw in the towel. It truly requires a lot of work and room for growth to be able to date your complete opposite. Being extroverted really is the only thing we do have in common personality wise, which helps because we are both adventurous, witty, and sociable. However, when we argue/discuss things it almost always takes incredibly longer than needed because I am very in touch with my emotions and he is not. Of course you ca thank the STP for that. He has a hard time seeing things from my perspective and vice versa. It takes us hashing it out and having to get defensive with one another before either of us can usually understand each other. I typically get my feelings hurt in the process and feel emotionally drained after fighting. What Microbugg said about hard-headedness is spot on. STPs are very difficult to relate to because they see things in black and white, where as we ENFJS typically see things with gray areas. I am definitely more mature both generally and emotionally than my boyfriend. I think it all comes down to if are you willing to evolve and grow to better understand your opposite. I am hoping that if we continue to work on better understanding one another and growing together, then we can make our relationship work long term. 
1	It’s a match made in hell 
0	Question	Do you ENFJ masturbate?
5	Of course they don't. They also don't poop btw.
2	ENFJ here: I was a PMO addict until a few years ago. Then I discovered /r/nofap. ENFJ's, like all other types, may or may not masturbate.
1	Yes 
1	Always. Especially while blowing my boyfriend. 
1	Everyone does. Kind of a strange question to ask.
10	Why is this sub so dead	Many of the other type's subs are far more active with many more subscribers :(
46	Because we're all outside taking over the world and fixing everyone's issues. 
5	[deleted]
4	Why I'm not that active here\n\n- Busy in real life activity\n- Prefer reading over commenting, especially when I deem the post doesn't need my assistance or comment.
5	as joymode said.  I'd assume most of the ENFJs are doing things irl more than spending time surfing reddit.  We are all about helping people.  I find myself frequenting the other subs to try and see if anyone needs support.
3	It's the holidays. We got our hands full atm...
3	Because ENFJs really aren't "reddit people". I'd say we're a bit more on the restless busy body side. And internet culture may not be as stimulating to us. We're all in social places feeding our  Fe. 
1	It's too sweet and sappy
1	We make up a very small percentage of the population, only 1 or 2% I believe.
8	ENFJ when you spend one-on-one time with someone, do you value that person/relationship highly? (not necessarily romantically)	I have an ENFJ Friend, and I sense that He’s Being Very Open With Me, we text a lot, hang out one-on-one mostly. But I Still Have Doubts (INFP, Of Course! I always doubt) If He Considers Me A Close Friend Or If I’m Part Of His Inner Circle. Some insights,please!
5	In my experience, I felt like my INFP friends were some of my best friends early into the friendship, but saying that would have freaked them out lol. We’re pretty good at reading who someone is, so we tend to know early on if they’re worth hanging out with. 
3	If hes opening up, he def enjoys your company. Attention is very important to me, so when I give it back, it means yes we're close and I like you. \nNow, for me personally, I have close friends who I do open up to, but then I also have super close friends ( my bffs/ childhood friends) who I open up to more about personal things. Thats just because we've been friends for years and I know them very well. \n\nDef give him attention, and try to open up as well. We loveeee when openess is reciprocated! Open when you're ready to open! 
3	ENFJ here. The more I spend one on one time with someone, the more likely it is that I consider that person to be of interest to me and the more I want to get closer to them.
1	Yes, every each of them even the one I dislike the most. But if you find me texting you first, a lot, means I like you and definitely extremely value this friendship. Also if you're an INFP please lower down your doubt, I got into fight with my best friend a lot because of her doubt even after I've showered her with countless of my times. It exhaust me, please keep trusting people as much as you want them to trust you.
7	I miss someone!	Do you feel like you miss someone but you do not know who exactly? \n
6	I envy the predicament you find yourself in.\n\nI'm not on speaking terms with a close friend of mine and I have a feeling this is the beginning of the end. I miss her and it hurts that it only took one mistake to undo the friendship we had. The worst part is that in my eyes, we didn't get the proper closure and how she handled the situation wasn't ideal at all. I understand that she's entitled to handle the friendship however she feels like it, but I wish things were different. I just have to quietly accept the fact that this is how it ends.
1	Extraverted sensing development	At what age did you first feel you were using your Se? What changes did it bring to your life? 
3	Who else took the mBTI personality test just because they didn't feel like an ENFJ now?	And just so you know this is what I'm going through this right now, so it'll help to know if other ENFJ's can relate to this as well :)
4	Yup I've done this before. Still got ENFJ lol. 
2	Huh
2	well, u can take the test again, but would you answer honestly what you would do, or what you should do in a situation. I personally still test ENFJ. 
28	Can any other ENFJs relate to....	The fact that we rarely get upset/mad. And it takes a lot to do so. *But when we do get upset*. **SOMEONE FRICKED UP. AND WE LET OFF A DARK NEGATIVE VOID OF VIBE DESTRUCTION** 
5	Have you ever looked at your Enneagram type? \n\nI am a type 1 and my profile explains that I repress anger/negative emotions because I think they are "wrong", which I identified with. I now try to express my negative emotions in a healthy way. 
4	Yeah. And it's like destroying the people too. They're unable to sleep for days etc. No joke this is real. Being ENFJ make us able to find the way how to be the best at building or destructing people.
1	Yes, most definitely
1	This is exactly me but my therapist says I should access and express my anger when it's at low levels more often so I don't blow up like that. It's a process.  
1	ENFJ here. Usually, I keep it in until it explodes, which is not a mature way to deal with it. We do have a dark side, no doubt.
1	Haha I'm either super upbeat and happy or completely and totally pissed off. There's no inbetween. 
1	I strongly relate. Someone really has to do something pretty awful or someone has to mess with my connection to someone I truly care about in order for me to feel very upset. It's very rare that I get upset, though. And even more rare that I get mad. 
2	ENTP!	Hey everyone! :) \nWhat is your experience with ENTP as friends or date? \nI have hard time dealing with them xD 
4	Rude.

0	ENFJ here. I don't like the P in ENFP. They're all over the place.
9	Dave Rubin (an ENFJ) trying to mediate his two friends from catfighting	
3	Wow, (for a fellow F), that's painful to watch.
3	We're patient. 
1	I hate it so much....
10	Personal side-projects and focus	Dear ENFJ's,\n\nI did a search and came up with no results on this topic.\n\nDo any of you maintain personal side-projects (hobbies that might become something more) in your spare time?\n\nI do, many in fact and the list of side-projects I maintain just keeps growing and growing. You can't leave me alone for five minutes without me coming up with another *brilliant* idea. It's the N in me. I can't control it.\n\nNaturally, I feel constantly overwhelmed. I love all of my ideas and I get excited by all of them. It is very hard for me to just focus and work on one because... there's all the others that I also want to work on.\n\nHave you had this kind of problem? If yes, have you found a way to focus your time and effort on just one of your personal hobbies/side-projects?
5	I used to over a decade ago.\nI would categorize them and then group by skill.\nAll the crochet, needlepoint, and embroidery hobbies I wanted to do required hand dexerity and reading plans.\nAll the clay, woodworking, and crafting took 3d spacial awareness and design theory.\nAll food in another category. \nThen I prioritized the skills. I figured the dexterity would help from working with the needle with the clay tools, etc. That trumped the want to create clay items for gifts and instead changed to arigumi and scarves as gifts. Having those gifts as goals helped set deadlines and had me reach out to experts for help. They would often advise how one skill could translate to other hobbies.\nFrom there, I work on two projects at a time.\nGood luck!
3	I wouldn't say it has become a problem for me yet, but I have started my first long-term passion project that I have the utmost enthusiasm for. I'm in journalism school and one of the stories I covered this semester was just too good to leave alone after I turned it for a grade. I'm actually set to go out tonight for it and the semester ended last week. My advice to you would be to focus in on that enthusiasm to see which project shines the most. From what I've learned so far, its often the project you'll the most fun with. 
2	Ugh yes. I'm doing software, music, woodworking and writing... its great xD.
1	Let me put it this way: One of my projects was to tell me in a random fashion on what project I should work on. Then, if I've spent time on a project it should get dismissed in the next random choosing.
10	What's the best way to ask you on a date?	If someone where to ask you on a date, would you prefer they be direct ("Do you want to go on a date with me to X place at X time?") or less straightforward ("We should hang out sometime - just the two of us.")?\n\nAlso, would you rather be asked on a date in person, via a phonecall, or through text message?
6	direct is a 5, indirect is a 2.  \nits less about how ENFJs resond, and more about what it says about you as a person.  \nan indirect person is much less attractive than one who knows exactly what he wants.  \ndoesnt matter how you relay it, but ive seen some hating msg or hating phonecalls. so .. by mindful of it, u might want to clarify before asking )  
6	Direct and in person-- I am an ENFJ and this is just my personal opinion. 
3	ENFJ here: Face to face, direct approach.
4	Maybe i’m not the norm, but too direct  kind of freaks me out but I generally am bad with and not attracted to people who are aggressive. I appreciate it if they just put in time to get to know me and spend time with me casually and if i’m also interested i’ll go along with it happily. I’m not going to have lengthy conversations or give significant amounts of time to someone of the opposite gender otherwise. 
1	I prefer to take the lead/initiative and any method is fine, though I prefer in person. But if you're certain I'm attracted to you -- be direct. Now, because I talk with you frequently doesn't necessarily mean I'm romantically attracted, because I enjoy stimulating conversation/discussion with anyone. \n\nHowever, if I'm asking you thoughtful questions which inspire you to elaborate, smiling and maintaining eye contact, and you ask me out, I'll probably laugh and say you beat me to it.... And really look forward to the date.
1	Direct - if we're pretty close.\n\nIndirect - if we aren't because higher chance I'll reject if you're being direct. I mean, I barely know you lol.\n\nI prefer text so I can think how to reject hahah. Anyway, just be the authentic-you. I as an ENFJ usually accept invitation so no worries.
1	Er, it depends... If I like you back, then in person... But, I also like to think about it and discuss it endlessly with my friends, so a txt or email would give me a chance to do that before responding.  I hate saying no to people, so if I don't like you back, I stress out on how to politely decline/demure.
5	I (INTJ) am surrounded by 3 of you for a group project, any advice on what i should expect?	
17	Oh man. Okay. Here goes:\n\nWatch for emotions. You’re walking on land mines. \n\n1. ENFJs respond much better with positive feedback than negative ones. Praise them on things they’re doing well even if it’s expected or obvious. \n\n2. Deliver negative feedback in one of two ways:\n\nA) use “I” statements eg: “I feel X when you do Y”. It refocuses the issue on the speaker than the receiver. “I fee frustrated when you hand in your portion late because Z”\n\nB) use “shit sandwich” if you have to give them shit. It’s compliment + they shit you really want to say + but compliment. It avoids torpedoing relationships to hell.  Eg “I think this is a good start, why don’t we improve X aspect so that we can achieve A, we/you’re doing well”.\n\n3) allow them to lead if they are competent. Take the reins if they are not. \n\n4) do not take more of the work than is responsible or fair. \n\nGood luck, intj. \n\n☺️
14	INTJs are great at managing pieces of a group project. ENFJs are great at managing the personalities of a group. We’re all about keeping the harmony, kind of like diplomats or active peace-makers. \n\nJust keep in mind that an ENFJ may not seem to be focused on the task at hand and may seem to be focusing on unnecessary pieces of the project, but there is always method to our madness. We keep everyone happy and motivated so you can bring in the solutions. 
6	My only real advice that I would find helpful is: I am more than happy to let someone else lead, because managing everyone's feelings means it takes a while to come to a consensus - in projects, I just want to get it done, and done well. Feel free to make the final decision, delegate jobs and tasks so everyone has something to do, set deadlines/expectations. They will love helping you and having a clear plan and goal to achieve as well.  When everyone is on the same page, team work is very rewarding.\n\nI would start by letting everyone contribute ideas. I really like having my say. Then picking the best idea. Although I'm sure you'll need to manage their time, because it's a weakness of mine. Maybe just sporadically ask, after telling them what you want, "What do we think? Are we ok with this?" You'll most likely get a yes, but doesn't hurt to ask in case you overlooked something.\n\nEnjoy! Haha
2	Expect everything to go well. You're very lucky. ENFJ's are very cooperative.
2	control issues. I am sorry we always want to be right 
2	Work the problems, pretend to think out loud as you present solutions, and smile at them.  Use a good smile, not the “I have you now” one.  I mean the, “puppies & kittens” smile, they like that one a lot.
1	By the way, how did you get to have so many ENFJ's all at once? We're a very rare type... Please do tell them about /r/ENFJ.
1	We get along great and are very cooperative! \n We do however like to set certain rules and standards and expect everyone to follow them. 
10	Im one of you!	Just found out/realized that i am an ENFJ. I used cognitive functions to figure it out. I spent so long wanting to be an ENTP and thinking i was an ESFJ and I have realized, truly, I am an ENFJ, the giver. 
7	Welcome, man! (or lass! Or anything else in between!) Glad to have you! c:
6	Interesting because I read somewhere that ENFJs often want to be ENTPs because they feel life would be easier without allllll the feelings and emotions controlling how they think and do and feel and say etc etc.\n\nENFJs are needed for just those reasons though! Welcome to the club ;)
5	Welcome to the clan! c:
5	Are you kidding? I always wanted to be ENTP too!\nOn 16personality I got INFP which is not me at all finally figuring the cognitive function I got ENFJ as well! Yay!\n
3	Hey there! I also went through different types until I realized I truly fit with ENFJ. I thought I was ENFP for a good while. Surprisingly, when I took the test five years ago I was INTJ! But this was when I was majorly depressed so I believe that had something to do with it. \n\nWhy did you want to be an ENTP?
8	The worst of ISTJ and ESTJ inventions for ENFJ's: paperwork!	Sometimes I (ENFJ) really feel that ISTJ and ESTJ's invented paperwork just to personally annoy me. I can't stand it! It's usually convoluted, mostly unnecessary (from my point of view), and sometimes right down *Minority Report*-y. I also don't like ISTJ and ESTJ's lack of emotional intelligence, empathy, and support when they deal with us NF's when we do paperwork.\n\n/rant
2	My ESTJ did good, very empathic and understanding.
2	Lol this reminds me of my ISTJ dad. He'd print out my grades in like 5-6 pages and put them on the counter. He would just sit in his chair until I saw them and confronted him about it
2	Too bad I can't upvote this thread twice
1	hmm...haven't experienced this yet.
5	ENFJs and meditation and other things	I'm ENTP, and most my ENFJ friends are deep life thinking and follow things such as meditation, tarot readings, star signs etc.\n\nSome of them are balanced while others call me up and give me a lecture about the meaning of life and abundance and to me, it just ends coming across cult-like and preachy. \n\nDo you agree? And if so what is going on here - a high reliance on Fe?
5	I think it can definitely be overly preachy. As an ENFJ, I think your imbalanced friends may be compensating for inner unhappiness, by expounding upon their discoveries to you. It could certainly be an over-reliance in Fe-dom. I'm a person who considers mindfulness and higher awareness of the world and the self to be very important, but I also know that I'm a small piece of existence, and my inner peace is neither very impressive or very important. Your friends could be making these discoveries and subsequently think their thoughts are God's gift to man, or that they're obligated to share with you. What is it about what they're sharing that you find particularly annoying?
3	I'm not too much into meditation and the things you've stated above.  Mostly because I tend to overthink things and have trouble sitting still/not doing anything.  I don't like over relying on things that don't have anything to back them up on.  I believe in stuff happening because of my life choices.\n\nIn my experience, people who tend to gravitate strongly towards things like astronomy (or even MBTI), usually justify their actions and mistakes instead of taking responsibility.  Like for example, they have difficulty with some social thing because they are this sign or MBTI or they are selfish because of that.\n\nIt's even more so that just because they rely on all this spiritual stuff, that they believe they know so much more about the world than everyone else and come off as pretentious.\n\nMy sibling use to be heavy into all these tarot readings and star signs that they spent a heavy amount of money from people who are supposedly professionals.  I'm just sitting here thinking anything they said about my sibling's future and spirituality did NO good and did not come true.  So when people bring up stuff like that, I can't help but want to write it off because it traps people into thinking that the universe laid this path for them and that they can't do anything to better themselves because they already believe they know it all.
7	What kinds of personalities usually dislike you?	I know some people really dislike big personalities, and I was wondering what other ENFJs experiences were with it. 
9	I think that most of my favorite people are ENFJs. I don’t know many people who don’t like them. 
8	ESTJ
8	Anything and everything that is IT or ST... And I (ENFJ) don't like them much either. They have no emotional intelligence whatsoever.
8	People disliking me? What is that? xD
4	I don't find that a lot of people dislike me. But I feel that at times I annoy INTJs. 
3	Caring more for about the trees than the forest, S's don't "get" me and my love of thinking in patterns - S's seem very focused on following letter of the law, rather than intent.  I  (ENFJ gal) get along with anyone N easily (my closest chosen people are INTP, INTJ - closest family member is ENTJ).
3	extraverted sensing	is it common for enfj's to feel introverted or very shy until the development of Se?
1	Yeah, I am secretly a shy muffin, but almost no one believes me - only those closest to me b/c I am pretty good at hiding it.
1	Yes, I was shy for a very long time. Once I got perspective on the world, as you do when you grow up, I suddenly became loud and outgoing and I thrive in it!
45	ENFJ in 5 Minutes	
10	Great video! This explains the ENFJ personality really well. I found myself nodding along to the explanations, haha.
3	Spot-on circa 3 min: "almost all ENFJs tend do well in school ... children can excel by being congenial and simply mimicking the adults. ... Older ENFJs who succeeded in this manner often struggle to define their own path and to forge their own identity later in life."\n\nI'm 31F, several years removed from academic accolades, currently feeling  most comfortable on staff at a university. Unclear on direction otherwise. I'm curious if other ENFJs share this type of experience.
2	Thanks!
0	Test With Functions	Hi :) Couple weeks ago I asked for a help with testing one personality test. A lot of people told to use cognitive functions. We did it. Please try test again and comment your result. \n\nIt's Free. No registration required. Congitive functions used. :) \n\nhttps://www.horozo.com/personality-type-test
1	I got enfp, but i’m enfj
4	Emotional Expression (Strong Fi)	How do you express your emotions without being SUPER loud and without, frankly, shouting?\n\nI've trained my solar plexus for a little over 6 years and have highly developed Fi as a result. My Fe is underdeveloped, though, so I have trouble expressing my emotions.\n\nI try to figure out how to let it out without just flat-out producing a very loud scream. I feel like I have to hold my emotions back, so I don't flat-out produce that incredibly loud scream. I'll try letting it out in bursts, but it's not satisfying and is actually kind of draining, seemingly due to incorrect usage of my Fe. I feel like there's a huge ball of excitement and enthusiasm waiting to explode that needs to be let out, but if I let it out, it'll be REALLY loud..Louder than a normal scream..and cursing will result.\n\nI'm an INTP. My Fi rivals my Ne in terms of development.
2	Interesting. I have terrible pain around this area. Trigger points etc rib cage/diaphragm pain. Hiatus hernia style symptoms \nI put this down to trying to control the frequent agitation and anxiety i get, this is where i feel my turmoil.\nI cant control it at the time, but to deal with the pain i work on facisa chains as defined by thomas myers that cover the area\nTotally does not answer your question, but perhaps you aren’t alone? 
1	Errm i cant
6	Trouble Expressing My Emotions	Hiya fellow ENFJs. I was recently retested for MBTI and I got ENFJ. Almost all the descriptions are spot on and really resonate with me. I was wondering if any of you experience extreme difficulties when it comes to opening up to people. For me, I love to listen to others and often encourage sharing, but I become hypocritical when I can’t do the same thing. If you experience the same thing, how have you worked to combat it? What has helped? 
4	>What has helped?\n\nTaking a page from Childish Gambino,\n\nhow can you open up to others when you can’t open yourself?\n\n\nI blockout me time daily. I use that time reflecting on myself and my emotions. Then I write it out in a bullet journal. That’s one way I take stock of my emotions and well being.
2	I would like to the hear someone answer this as well. \n\nI am an ENFJ and feel the same way. Some label me "emotionless" but will then label me as a "built in therapist/teacher" because I am very in tune with others emotions - they are very easy to read. But my own expression of emotions are few and far between. 
2	Lol I'm really emotional and dramatic. I usually have to step away from the situation to collect my thoughts...
11	It's my birthday!	I wish I could share my cake with you and give you all a hug and tell you how awesome you are!
2	I wish you all the happiness in the world :)
1	Happy birthday! 
1	no you, you awesome! happy birthday!
3	ENFJ - ENTJ	I'm an ENTJ male. I'm looking for ENFJs opinion on mature ENTJs.\n\nAlso, how's ENFJ(f) - ENTJ(m) relationship like? All inputs are welcome.
3	I am an ENFJ (f) and my partner is ENTJ. He is the perfect person for me, and I think I for him. \nHe is 7 years older than me and I'd say we are about the same maturity, I don't know any younger ENTJs though so I'm not sure how it would be different if he were younger.\nHe has the no bs personality, while I hate conflict, so he is handy for negotiations! \nI think I soften him a little too and bring out his gentle side. Not sure how helpful that is, but happy to answer mor specific questions!\n
7	ENFJ or eSFJ?	INTP here.  Story, met this girl at an airport a year ago.  We've kept in touch since then.  Had her take an MTBI test recently and she scored ESFJ, but i think she's more ENFJ based on my experience with ESFXs.  I know a bunch of ESFX, but no ENFJs.  Some bullet points that makes think so:\n \n- She actually brought up philosophical stuff a couple times; started with a video of a philosophical discussion about death. This is what got me really curious about her type. \n- She's into personal development, motivation, moving forward in her career.\n- She doesn't talk about people in her life much, although she does send me pictures with her family.\n\nIts not much to go off of but its different than the conversations i typically have with ESFXs.  What do you guys think?  What else should i look for/ask about?
2	sounds pretty ESFJ to me, and ENFJ is much more  abstract and cold, borderline ENTJ ) - if theres no authistic vibe shes probably ESFJ  \npeoples interestest have nothing to do with their functions . values do though 
1	Sounds like an ENFJ.
1	I’m also trying to decide if a friend of mine is ENFJ or ESFJ! He’s a sports fan/ racing junkie ... loves drinking and smoking, and retro console games. Screams tertiary Se to me. Look out for the tertiary Se.
4	Coincidence or common theme?	Do you have trust issues? After seeing multiple threads professing issues with trust, I wonder how common it is among us? Is it purely coincidence or is a common thread due to our overly trusting nature? Also, do you struggle with fears of abandonment?
5	yoooooo, i see you buddy! :D fellow stardew player.\n\nI don't have trust issues, mostly because if someone stabs me in the back, i don't really take responsibility for it.  I also don't blame myself because that person made that bad choice to shit on me to begin with and that makes them a shitty person.  Trust is also earned, not given. Which is basically if they break my trust, they would have to climb/move mountains to win my trust.\n\nI do fear loneliness, but I always have hope that I'll find good friends/relationships.  Like, if people choose to stick around, then it's all the better.  If they don't wanna, then why stop them?  I don't spend time squandering my life  lamenting on the people who have no loyalty to my friendship.  If they feel like they can abandon me, then I don't really need people like that.
3	>Do you have trust issues?\n\n\nI tend to be less forgiving towards those who break my trust, intentional or not. Apology accepted, trust denied.\n\nThis [website](https://www.16personalities.com/enfj-personality) Does a good job of explaining our dilemma.\n\n>The interest ENFJs have in others is genuine, almost to a fault – when they believe in someone, they can become too involved in the other person’s problems, place too much trust in them.... ENFJs are vulnerable to another snare as well: they have a tremendous capacity for reflecting on and analyzing their own feelings, but if they get too caught up in another person’s plight, they can develop a sort of emotional hypochondria.\n\nOn your other question,\n>Do you struggle with fears of abandonment?\n\nYes, I've struggled with this due to childhood traumas. What I hate the most are people who act so cold-hearted towards those who make mistakes. We're only human. Sure maybe it's their way of ending things quick and easy. In my eyes, it's a cowards way to out. How immature it is for someone to end things with hurtful words only used to incite negative emotions. Whatever is the case, it draws so many hurtful memories from my childhood that I'll stand up for someone who is mistreated. I can't help but think that whoever acts cold-hearted is a monster.\n\nSay what you mean and mean what you say, I'll hate you if you use words you don't mean. I take what you say to heart because that's usually all that I'll have left to remember you by...
2	I'm an ENFJ and I have major trust issues and abandonment issues. It interferes with my current relationships a lot. Its a hard thing to overcome. 
1	I wouldn't say I have trust issues. I take trust very seriously...if anyone breaks it, whatever relationship we had is gone. People have to earn my trust. I'm very open about my life, but there are certain things I'm very cautious about sharing/trusting. 
15	ENFJ - Are you good at flirting?	Im an ENFJ female and I am really good at flirting and I'm also a great wingman! Are other ENFJs good at flirting too? Is is because we can easily read people? Cause damn, I'm just hella smooth.
15	Charm, yes. But flirt, no.
8	My stepmom used to say that I could charm the white off rice :)
7	It seems to be our native tongue.
7	im enfj female as well. took me years to go from socially awkward to adorable cheese when it comes to flirting
5	Most of the time I'm great, but like everyone, there's probably a dozen or so times I can recall when my brain got in the way.
3	Very much so. \nI think it has everything to do with our ability to read others - we know what they're thinking right away and that's very easy to work with!
3	As an ENFJ I am naturally charming and a good flirt but I don't match well with just any personality type. If the girl is **T**hinking, it can be quite difficult. If the girl is feeling I can do pretty much whatever I want with her. I am married by the way, and I don't flirt around anymore. Just to get that out of the way...
2	Yes. 
2	My aunt is an ENFJ and often says, "I'm your wingman." to people. And she is. She so is.\n\n
1	I think I'm not good at flirting (rather better at relating to people on a serious level) but when I talk to my friends, they seem to think flirting is a strength of mine. As with other ENFJ's I know, we're not flirty in the "traditional" sense, but rather flirty in a way that we know what each person needs to engage. Someone looking on might think that we're not flirting, just talking about something interesting.
4	How do you describe a special connection with someone?	I feel is hard to put it into words, and I would love to hear what you think about it.
6	I connect with a lot of people, however, there is something very special about having a deep and special connection with someone. \n\nA special connection is when:\n- you can trust someone with anything and everything\n- you feel they are absolutely loyal (friendship or relationship)\n- you know they will accept you at your best and your worst\n- they are good communicators *** (very important to me)\n- you genuinely love that person and want the absolute best for them unconditionally  
3	Being able to grow together even when both of you spend time apart. Having unconditional love and sometimes stronger feelings for one another even when both of you are in relationships.\n\nI have a close friend of mine recognize her feelings for me and still keep boundaries so that it doesn’t hurt her current relationship.\n\nOdd that we never became more than just friends because we’ve confessed mutual affection for one another. Maybe we’re just both scared of losing what we have in both of us if we pursue something together (I know I am). Maybe that’s all we will be for one another and I’m okay with that.
2	I would say a special emotional connection is when both can communicate openly with each other and know that the other person is someone who they can rely on and trust. Both individuals must also have respect for each other. Also, for me, I value the ability to have a deep discussion with someone very much. 
1	A special connection as in good compatibility? Or what a special connection as in a close relationship and what that looks like to each individual?
20	Reminder: You can't Care for others until you care for yourself	I'm sure I can speak for several ENFJ's when I say that we can often stress ourselves out trying to meet the needs of everyone around us. I know for myself personally that I've had several times where I've found myself alienating my closest friends because I've tried prioritizing EVERYBODY at once and running myself completely thin. This can make others feel like they're "scheduled-in" and like they are on the same level as every other person who you are spending time with, even if they've been your best friend since birth. \n\nI run into this trap every time I stop prioritizing myself first and foremost, and started running into it recently before I stopped myself and said, "No, wait a second, don't make any plans this weekend, spend this on yourself." The difference was between night and day. I took some time to focus on doing things that I know are good for ME and that I enjoy, even if it meant not spending time with friends and family who reached out, and that meant that the next weekend I had all the energy in the world for the people that mattered the most to me. \n\nI thought I'd share this thought because I figured it might help out other ENFJ's who can get trapped in a constant cycle of helping and spending time with others. If we really want to be the best friend or confidant that we can be, we have to prioritize ourselves first and foremost. Thinking of it this way can help justify the decision to put ourselves first once in a while. 
6	    Self-Care Ideas for ENFJs:\n    * Find a trusted friend to talk to one-on-one.\n    * Exercise with a good friend.\n    * Spend time with animals.\n    * Catch up on sleep!\n    * Enjoy some time in nature; notice every sight, sound, and texture.\n    * Get some of your favorite snacks and watch a light-hearted movie.\n    * Think about your own personal goals and imagine ways to reach them.\n    * Do yoga or another relaxing, quiet exercise.
3	Another way to see this. I ask myself "is this meaningful" when trying to make people based decisions. Wording the question that way speaks to our Ni, our second function and really starts to feel natural over time. Let's face it, we lead with Fe. People are our everything. So if we prioritize people related things via Ni, maybe, just maybe, can we develop the rest of our lives. 
3	I needed to see this. Thank you!
1	Wow. Thank you for this.
3	ENFJ - Do you prefer a long-term relationship?	As an ENFJ do you believe in staying with one person for life? Or a long term relationship? Why or why not? I'm having troubles with believing long term relationships could work for me after my last relationship. I'm afraid I'll get bored and myself or the other person will change for the worst.
11	I do. But I’m also a romantic. The shortest relationship I’ve ever had still lasted 9 months. \n\nEDIT: Do I BELIEVE in staying with one person for life? No. You have to go through multiple people until you find “the one,” usually. But I do prefer long term relationships over flings. 
6	I do! I got married last year and I do believe I’ll be with them forever. I understand the fear of getting bored, which is why marriage isn’t for everybody. I took my time dating people but i had no doubt I was looking for someone long term and i found them after time. 
3	I believe that people stay in your life for as long as they're meant to. If I found someone that was as loyal as I am (once someone has my loyalty, they have it for life so long as they don't betray me) then I could see myself being with them for life. However, if I can't find someone that I'm that compatible with as well as have their full undivided loyalty... then who knows.  \n\nIn general, I think people typically have multiple relationships throughout their life. It's normal.
3	They can. I married almost six months ago and don't regret it. But it took me five tries before I got it right. The four previous girlfriends were all bad matches. The obvious things like maturity, emotional stability, and compatible core beliefs/values aside, as an ENFJ, I recommend you other NF's or SF's but no NT's and much less ST's. My wife's an INFJ/ISFP (her N/S and J/P are very “in the middle”).
2	I do, in a relationship with my first boyfriend 2 years and counting. :)
2	It's not so much that I *believe in* long-term relationships. Some people are fine without them. I'm in a long term relationship (14 years FTW) and I believe it's for the long haul and am very happy with it.
8	Married ENFJs, how would you deal with your partner changing his or her mind about having children?	My partner (29m, ENFJ) and I (25f, INFP) have been together for three years, married for seven months. Our relationship has consistently been strong and intensely loving, and neither of us can imagine our life without the other. For the first two years of our relationship, we discussed having children in the distant future, and even jokingly came up with a tentative list of names for our hypothetical little clan. After getting married, I realized that I don't want children after all. A few months ago I was on the fence, constantly carrying with me an internal debate, asking myself the difficult questions, but now I'm about 120% sure that I would not be happy with children. I've voiced my thoughts to my partner on multiple occasions, and he told me it's not something we have to worry about now and reassured me he's open to not having kids. One time I was in the middle of a panic attack (I suffer from depression and anxiety) and in the middle of it blurted out that I don't want kids, and he responded with, 'it's okay, then I don't want them either.' But knowing him so well, I can almost certainly guarantee that he says these things to ease my anxieties while inwardly longing to have children - he will still joke about his 'four daughters' and bring up our list of names every now and then. At the same time he says that he wants to be with me at all costs. I have a feeling that he is taking the 'maybe she will change her mind' stance - which I feel is dangerous. \n\nThis is so painful for me because more than anything, I want him to be happy and I would never forgive myself if it turned out that being with me caused him to regret something of such magnitude. I want to say that I would rather he leave me and find someone whose vision is more compatible with his, but I don't think I can survive the end of the relationship - he is my whole world. I have tried repeatedly in these past few months to convince myself that I do want children, but I just don't. And I'm certain that if I do have children reluctantly, I will not be able to help resenting them and end up losing him regardless. \n\nENFJs, I guess I'm wondering what your inner stream of consciousnesses would be if you were in this situation. It would be helpful for me to know so I can figure out what my next steps should be. Thanks!
9	I don't know if this is so much an ENFJ question as it is a children / no children question. \n\nI personally really want to have children, so if I married someone, I would want to make sure we were on the same wavelength, as it's probably the most important thing to me. I don't mind if I don't get that dream career, house, holiday, dog, whatever, but I want a family.\n\nSome people never want to have children, which is just as valid and reasonable. \n\nAnd then there are people like your husband who probably love you and want to be with you no matter what, whether children are on the table or not. If he says he doesn't mind, then he doesn't mind. Relax. It's possible this is the depression and anxiety causing havoc where there is really no need for concern.\n\nBut if you really, really want to know how he feels, just talk to him. 
5	Hi I’m actually INFP, but your post struck me for a couple reasons. Firstly, I had someone do this to me and it was devastating. In my case, it was more of a bait and switch situation. My ex wanted me to believe we would have kids to lure me in, but changed his mind after I committed.  Needless to say, it didn’t work out and I should’ve seen the signs.\n\nI don’t think this is what’s happening with you, though. It’s a pretty big deal to change your stance on children, and it’s a particularly surprising flip flop when your marriage is so new.  It sounds like your SO is agreeing with you now in hopes you’ll change your mind back to wanting kids. \n\nI’m wondering if you’re anxiety/insecurity is causing you to “test” the level of commitment of your spouse. Sometimes when you’re depressed or anxious, it’s tempting to push people to see if they’ll still love you.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with not having kids. But you’ve brought another person into your future and they deserve a healthy communication. Maybe some therapy could help,
4	I’m married, and in 4-5 years, I want to have kids. Specifically a daughter. I also have a list of names and my wife and I have already decided on a girl’s name. \n\nIf my wife said she didn’t want kids, the first time she said it, I would assume she’s scared and would try to ease her mind by showing her the episode of Scrubs “My Way Home” (s5e7) in which Carla thinks she won’t be able to handle a kid:\n\n> Dr. Cox: Carla, look at me and Jordan. You know how we hate everyone?\n\n> Carla: Yeah.\n\n> Dr. Cox: Well, that goes doubly for children. It's true. They're loud, you can't understand them, they're like tiny cab drivers. But, trust me, when you do have your own kid, you won't feel that way.\n\n> Carla: Yeah, what--what will be different?\n\n> Dr. Cox: He'll be yours.\n\nI’m not trying to convince you to have a kid. I just love Scrubs haha. \n\nBut, if my wife made it very clear that she never wants kids and that that door of our life is closed to her, I would submit. I would give in because ***I love her more than my desire for children.***\n\nSounds to me like your husband *truly* loves you. He loves you selflessly and shows it. \n\nSounds like your husband might be leaving the door open with all those hints. Have you made it clear that the door is closed and he understands that it will never happen? If not, you don’t have to. Only you know what that will do to your marriage. But if he’s similar to me, he’ll still stick with you and love you. 
3	And just to develop the thoughts above, and add to them, I feel like you’re already aware of this; but you would effectively be unilaterally changing the terms of the marriage agreement between you and this effectively releases him from keeping his terms. Yes I do feel it’s unfair to him to go into a marriage expecting one thing and end up with another, there’s responsibility to your spouse in this sense. If you get married and one person unilaterally decides there’s never going to be sex/affection/kids/emotional bonds, whatever, ever again in the marriage, well that’s a breach of trust and contract.  \n\nOTOH I know it’s a complex psychological space and of course you don’t want to bring children into the world who find out they’re secretly resented by their mom. There can also be rational or irrational fears from those of us who have never had kids.  And not all of us are equipped to love in the way kids need. I understand this having had an ex who de facto made us childless (he said he wanted them but I think it was never on his agenda) by unilaterally stopping sex. He was so scarred from childhood neglect that in truth, he probably didn’t have it in him to love selflessly and he knew this deep down (i was idealistic and thought ‘nah you’d be fine! But he was right). But I lost my most fertile years during that relationship. I also had a mom who resented raising children and found it too demanding and stressful.  And grew up feeling unloved. So I see both sides of the coin. \n\nI just feel that marriage does come with responsibilities, you gave your word and that’s should be honoured, or your husband should be considered free to come or go.
3	You should definitely pose this question to r/childfree if you haven't already. 
1	Just to let you know, your partner love for you is GREATER than the needs of having children. Besides, children needs a lot of attention and care which not every family can manage. Maybe she already thought about it as well.\nWell, not going to lie of course your partner is quite sad about it but if that's the better way for your relationship, then your partner will gladly agree. :)\nThis is my piece of mind.\nMind my english please :)
1	My partner *did* change his mind, and we ended up not having more kids (I already have one). I was sad for a while but now I'm in my late 30's and don't care as much. I don't resent it, but I did in my 20's.
1	My wife is an INFJ/ISFP. We've been married for 6 months.\n\nMy wife suffers from major depression disorder and she's been very eager to have children from the very beginning of our relationship. Unfortunately, we have reason to believe that she might be infertile. I would like to have children but as an ENFJ I don't *feel* that that would be the greatest experience for me to have in life, so going without them wouldn't bother me. I have repeatedly told my wife that I love her whether she can have children or not and I meant it. I also often make those jokes. That's what they are, jokes.\n\nIf you have any doubts, you can sit with him and simply ask him what his true feelings about having children are and if he really can live without having them. You can open up to him about your fears of making him unhappy. If he tells you that it is OK, it is OK. And I have a feeling that it is OK.
2	Need some help :)	Hello, guys :) I'm MBTI fan and trying to help my friend. He own small social network where main feature is Questions Game - people talk to each with pre-prepared questions or use their own questions list. The main idea to filter users and show related members are totally oposite options: 1) compatible members by zodiac sign 2) compatible by personality type. So, he created personality test which contains 32 questions. I want you to ask to take that test and tell is it accurate or not :) \n\nYou don't need to create an account or login to take test, but you can create it if you like the idea and want to try other features :) So, link to test is: \n\nhttps://www.horozo.com/personality-type-test\n\nAny comments, ideas, critics are welcome!\n\n\nHello, guys. I need your help. I'm a MBTI fan and trying to help my friend to create MBTI based personality test which should be accurate and fast to solve. We are not experts and first version is live.

7	An ENFJ and An INTP	Are they truly compatible? \n\nI've been with my partner(the INTP) now for almost 6 years and I find that I'm never getting what I want out of the relationship (A strong emotional bond), but always feel like he is. I understand his heavy introverted feelings and the need to be left alone, the craving for a good debate, etc, but he doesn't really know how to comfort me after all these years still, and my eyes keep wandering to other people who seem to understand me better. \n\nSo my questions is: Are INTPs and ENFJs actually compatible, and do they make a healthy relationship? Or is what I'm going through with mine common? \n\nI'm just struggling through the relationship and I understand I can't ask him for too much, but I'm in a bit of a rut where I don't know to make it or break it. I want everything to work cause I do love the dork, but I'm just scared over my own feelings. I've talked with him about everything and he doesn't seem interested in change or learning so I'm just not sure anymore. 
13	I find mbti is never to be used as a predictor, just an explainer. Any two people may or may not get along. If you want insight into why, try personalities and strengths. But try and avoid mbti therefore this will or won't work. People are more complex than that. 
8	Besides what u/chaseshaw mentioned about mbti (which I agree with), here are my thoughts:\n\nThere's too many red flags from what you've written to seriously consider taking a break from the relationship to really think things over and maybe even get a feel of him not being around. \n\nThe red flags:\n- "he doesn't really know how to comfort me after all these years still (6 years!) \n- not getting the emotional bond (very important for idealists)\n- "my eyes keep wandering to other people"\n- "I don't know to make it or break it"\n- "I've talked with him about everything and he doesn't seem interested in change or learning"\n\nThose are enough for me to put brakes on the relationship for me to reassess my position and needs. How long the break will go for is your choice (but discuss with him obvs). \n\nI am dating an INTJ and although we've only been together for less than a year, we've learned enough from each other to meet each other's needs. I am happy to give him alone time and not expect the "live out loud" type of love, and he's learned to open up albeit in private. \n\nSix years is a long enough time. Your time is precious, and so is his. \nIf you stay in the relationship, remember that you cannot and should not change him. He'd have to do that himself..and if you're asking for him to change something that is fundamental to him, it will only lead to dissatisfaction and resentment. \n\nDon't be afraid to let go and don't settle because "good is the enemy of great."   \n\nGood luck.
2	My boyfriend is INTP, my best friend is INTP and my godfather is INTP, I have brilliant relationships with all three of them. Admittedly, my boyfriend and I have had challenging moments however for the exact reason you've just mentioned. I'm referring to the emotional bond that you feel you are lacking. \n\nI think both the commenters above have given great advice, but I'll add this. INTP's feel every bit as much emotion as you and I. The breakdown comes with expression. INTP's tend to lack confidence, and so when they are unsure how to express themselves, they tend to freeze up and crawl slowly back into their shell. At least this has been my experience. What works great for me, is when I am needing emotion from him, I snuggle up next to him and I talk to him. I ask him questions, sometimes painful, sometimes not, and I press him. I tell him how I am feeling that I am struggling emotionally amd that I need him to be vulnerable with me for a bit. Once he feels safe, secure, and understands that I need that intimate emotion, he opens up. He usually cries and holds me. He has so much powerful emotion, but he just simply does not know what to do with it. This is enough for me, to simply see how much he cares from time to time is all that I need. \n\nSo I think that there are a couple of factors for you to think about. 1st, what do you need? Do you need encouragement? Deeper emotion? More love? More expression? I think you meed to nail down precisely what your lacking. 2nd what does he need that you may not providing? \n\nFinally, I'm in a polyamorous triad. My boyfriend is INTP and my girlfriend is INFJ, my INTP cannot fulfill all my needs, nor can my INFJ, so I am lucky to have both. Good luck!
2	My best friend is an INTP. Early on in our relationship I know I smothered him with all the gushy ENFJ love stuff. I felt he was very hot and cold with me for a long time. It wasn't until I learned more about him that I learned that he was protecting himself. \n\nWhen I thought he was cold, he was really just being cautious. He had been hurt a lot in his life, and he wasn't used to someone loving him unconditionally in the way that I do. I think that he was also afraid of letting himself feel things. \n\nHe is way more sensitive than 99% of people who know him would ever guess. But, because he has been burned and believes that most people can not be trusted, he doesn't want to show all his cards, so to speak, and express those deep feelings.\n\nBut I have communicated that sometimes I need verbal affirmation and I desire physical touch. He has communicated that he needs space sometimes and that if he takes time to himself, it is nothing against me. We've both made efforts to accommodate the other because we share a strong bond.\n\nIn a way I believe it is harder to be an INTP than an ENFJ. I truly think they feel things just as deeply as us, but they struggle with expression and then end up questioning if people think they feel at all. \n\nAll that being said, if you are straying, you need to cut him loose. It's not fair to him.
1	Heck yeah they are..typically. Try these 3 things: Lucid dreaming (attempt to see each other in lucid dreams..This may result in anima/animus). Try meditating on your 4th and 2nd chakras as well. This is basically basic meditation with your main focus being emotion and intimacy (2nd chakra) and love and connection (4th chakra). Visualization can help. The "right" or primary urge you may exhibit is feeling in an intimate and romantic sense (2nd chakra) and to "love" (4th chakra). You should also notice elevated traits such as creativity, joy, adaptability, sensuality, fertility, pleasure, and sexuality (2nd chakra) and love, , trust, healing, equanimity, compassion, connection, and surrender (4th chakra). These are in positive contexts, not negative contexts. Excessive or insufficient usage (frequency, not amplitude) can result in negative things happening, but you should notice if that occurs.\n\nYou should notice changes after ~10-20 minutes a day for ~2 weeks, though it takes time to develop them to a notable extent (give it ~4 weeks).\n\nhttp://brightstarrynight.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/1vita-chakra-chart2.jpg
1	I'm INTP and I've gotten better at F matters.  They just took several depressive episodes to keep pushing me into dveloping myself in those areas, and really seeing value in them.  Pretty extreme. Looking back, I was pretty bad (like your bf), but I've definitely gotten better; I have the tools and skills now, just need to remember to use them.  So it is possible, but if your bf isn't willing to develop himself to meet your needs, and seeing inate value in those things, I don't know if it'll ever be possible, at least while you two are ina relationship where he's too comfortable to make a change.   
0	enfjs and screanwritting?	i dont know why but this thought just popped into my head that enfjs would make great movies,just simply because of there people skills and social intellegence.would do you guys think?,and do you ever write short stories if so send them to me id like to read them!
8	I think that this thought totally makes sense. I can see ENFJs writing amazing films. I wonder how many of today’s top writers are ENFJs.
4	😂 I'm an ENFJ in collage studying screenwriting.  
3	ENFJ screenwriter here! I anyways tell people it feels like the thing I was meant to do. 
4	screanwriting? nobody is going to take you seriously if you can't spell...
5	Insights for interacting with ENFJ for ol'ENTJ me?	I befriended an ENFJ a while back and she's been such an incredible, supportive and inspiring person. She spent so much time teaching me, inspiring me and generally being supportive. It boggles my mind how you guys are so incredibly impatient, insightful and caring. \n\nProblem is, I don't know how to return that level of support and empathy. When she asks for my help on some of her creative works, I tend to point out logical fallacies and provide practical solutions - which she is not very proficient at implementing. Yet, she constantly seeks my opinion and I feel like my answers are demotivating her because she doesn't fundamentally "get" what I'm talking about but she's constantly revising because she wants an approval. \n\nI really don't know what to do. I don't want to be a toxic influence but I don't want to lie when she's relying on me for honest critique? \n\nAny ENFJs here familiar with ENTJs? What can an ENTJ do for you guys? 
4	Me! ENTJ SO of near 6 years.\n\nIn my experience, ENFJs at work are rather independent, and perfectly capable of conceptualising the “logical thing to do” in any given situation. \n\nWe aren’t ill-equipped just because we’re feelers — we might just like to have someone to 1) echo/confirm that we’re on the right track, and 2) advise us on the execution if we’re not good at it.\n\nWithout knowing the context, I’m not sure if this applies to you. She might feel like you’re telling her things she already knows, and what she might like would be a little bit of affirmation/ confirmation. You can try ending your suggestions with “anyway, I’m always here if you ever need anything.” That is short and sweet, without sounding like you’re just trying to tell her what to do.
3	You return it by simply listening to her and appreciating what she does. ENFJs love to help people, so when she listens or helps you, its her way of showing you she cares. Make sure you let her know you appreciate her. \n\nShe is probably just confirming with you what she thinks to be true (or not, depends on the situation) because she values your honesty and opinion. I'm an ENFJ and I love to go to my INTJ friend if I want an honest answer. She must know this is how you answer, so why would she keep asking if she didn't want your advice or help? Like said in the previous comment, just because she's a feeler doesn't mean she can't use logic. I find as an ENFJ I tend to use logic in conjunction with my knowledge of emotion and my intuition about people to assess emotional situations, that's why we are so good at it. \n\nIf you think you should offer her emotional support, as her. If you aren't comfortable with it, than I'm sure you'll be just fine. If she confides in you, she must trust you. \n\nHope this helps! 😄
1	I like how thoughtful you are being.\nPerhaps phrase your feedback as that from a T perspective so its understood in that context, and it would therefore appeal to other T’s and perhaps analyst types 
14	Asking for help as an ENFJ	I have the hardest time asking for help when I really need it. I don't want to bother anyone and I don't want to come across as needy. Do any other ENFJs feel the same, and how do you overcome it? 
8	If someone were to approach you for help, would you help them? \n\nENFJs are often called the Giver. Typically, those who share our type do help those who approach us. We give everything we can and love them for it. \n\nExtend that generosity to yourself. It's far easier said than done. You don't have to regurgitate your entire life story onto a friend immediately, work with what you're initially comfortable with. \n\nEach person is different though, but we all need some sort of emotional release. People want to help you as you want to help others. 
6	I like to do things on my own. Only time I like asking for help is when I really need it! 
3	Define what kind of help you need?\n\nIf you don't want to bother anyone with the weight you bare on your shoulders, then i'd suggest you seek professional help. I've been going to therapy since my Freshman year in college (Graduating this year) and its been a very positive experience. In the four years I've been getting help it's been a journey of self-discovery and learning. Now of course there has been rough patches and times where things got really bad, but I stuck with the treatment and got the medication I need. Now I've gotten more confident in myself and how I deal with my inner demons. I can't imagine where I would be if I didn't seek the professional help i needed.\n\nIf you got the means then I highly recommend getting professional help. Instead of relying on others who might not have the same experiences as you or are not emotionally stable enough to help, a therapist is the best option you have. It's their job to help those that can't help themselves.\n

10	alright locking and warning you to stop spamming this sub.  we've had reports of your posts literally providing no value of discussion here.
7	Perhaps you're in the wrong sub?
0	fe and superfical?	ok so cate blanchette is type infj by celebritytypes.com and oprah an enfj,so i was watching an interview with cate blanchette and stephen colbert and both seemed a bit fake?,cate blanchette came across as sarcastic and oprah came across like this fake happy person,it feels like oprah was not being herself or sharing her true ideas,but just trying to appeal to the interviewer?
3	Fe can be seen as fake, yes
1	Fe makes us easily comform to the situation if unchecked by our other functions. We're not trying to be fake. We just seem to care too much.
20	Overthinking as an ENFJ	How do I stop overthinking?! Do any other ENFJs overthink? Its getting to the point that it's causing me too much anxiety to bare.
17	Yea that's something i've always had to struggle with. I'm sorry you're going through this right now. \n\nWhat helps simmer my thoughts is taking a quick walk around my campus or sit at my favorite spot and just space out.\n\nIf you're not the outdoor type, brew some tea, dim the lights, and listen to music. [Sashamarie](https://soundcloud.com/sashasashamarie) from the music group, [Soulection](https://soulection.com/) always got the good beats I can vibe out too.\n\nI also fold origami cranes and that really helps a lot when I begin to over think. It's as if my thoughts are moving from my head, through my fingers, and into the folds of the paper. Those thoughts negative as they might be, then become something beautiful. Like an origami crane, it puts me at ease every time.\n\nI hope you find something that helps.
12	For me, I kinda have to set aside time in order for me to think things through. I think a lot over literally everything. So, I found I have to give myself time in order for me to think.\n\nThere are two activities for me: That which I can do and allow myself to overthink, and those which I can't overthink while doing. Having a balance of those in a day are the days where I feel the least overwhelmed and anxious. Vocalizing and talking about what's on my mind also helps me from overthinking. \n\nFor example: I go running, that allows me to think while moving my legs and get out some of that energy. A shower also allows me to think for a bit coming down from that high. Then, I immediately transition to something that requires my full thought. It could be talking to someone or homework. \n\nBest of luck, friend.

4	I'm also an ENFJ that tends to over think things a lot. For me, here are things that help: \n\n1) Using a creative outlet (for example, playing piano, drawing, singing, playing guitar, etc.) Listening to music is relaxing as well. \n\n2) Speaking to others. Letting out the thoughts that bother you to someone you trust can be extremely relieving. I find that once I've vented to someone, most issues become much simpler and clearer to understand. Your confidants can also give you helpful advice. \n\n3) Expressing frustrations through writing. Writing in a journal or diary helps, along with making a sort of 'mind map' with what is causing you stress and what strategies you want to use to solve the problem. \n\n4) Doing an activity that stops you from thinking about it. This could be exercising, or completing homework or other work that makes you focus intensively on it. Or even sleep on it! :) \n\nI hope this helps you find a way to ease your mind! Us ENFJs often have these times where we overthink things, and I know you can get through yours! Best of luck :) 
4	Overthinking is my middle name. It always has been since I was a kid..I overthink about the way people view me. I care so deeply about others that I fear losing them and therefore overthink any little thing that could effect my friendship/relationship with that person. It really frustrates me at times...sometimes I just want to know how to let things go, not care what people think of me, etc... But I don't really know how to do this..
3	I talked to my dr and take an anxiety pill before bed 😀
2	Well, going by cognitive functions to stop Ti overthinking, engage Fe or Se.  Do some socializing or venting, or something active, or something artistic, or listen to music to drown out your thoughts...
2	we are always thinking about potential.... in others, processes, and things around us. It's easy to overthink when we like to see improvement all the time! 
2	I get this\nI go For deliberately focusing attention on something else, be aware when i’m over thinking. \nAcknowledge that the brain responds to thoughts and actual events the same way emotionally so not to drift in the negative scenarios. \nWhen the actual scenario had finished not the version in my head i purposefully go through did any of my imagined scenarios happen and what was it actually like. Usually they didn’t or if they did because the actual people were there how it panned out was much less difficult.\nWhen feeling anxiety ask has this happened before in real life, or do you think it might happen\nAll the best x 
2	I overthink A LOT. \nWriting down my thoughts helps a lot. Once a situation is resolved, I go back and read my crazy thoughts and laugh at myself and call myself a drama queen. 
16	ENFJ - Crushing on people too fast!	I crush on people fast and hard. Everyone else moves so much slower when it comes to crushing on people. Is this a normal ENFJ thing, and is it healthy? I don't even know if I can help it! And I'm so direct when I'm into someone, I feel like I get on their nerves. Can you relate? 
13	It's very easy for ENFJ types to see the potential in others and always want to encourage them to grow. That being said, it's easy to fall in love with people in the process. Happens to me all the time as an ENFJ. 
3	Yes we all do this. Don't change it. Just become more attractive so they're quickly into you too.

7	What was something you did that made you think, wait this isn't a very ENFJ thing to do?	
8	[deleted]
7	I can be really selfish. I hate crowds and after going through a crowd or the mall or something, I get really introverted. 
6	Until last year, I was a consultant traveling almost five days week around the country.  My boss always pushed me to work with clients all day long, then try to take them out to dinner. His angle was that the personal relationship built over an informal setting would help cement our working relationship and help us keep the client paying. I did this for a while, but started to really enjoy withdrawing after a day's work, having a drink alone at the bar, then watching Netflix on my laptop and falling asleep early.  I came to love my solitude in a hotel room, like an introvert. I think it started as a way of rebelling against my overbearing boss, and possibly a way of getting away from some of my peskier clients, but I actually started to appreciate what an introvert likes about solitude for the first time.
2	- Prefer alone time over large gathering\n- Being a bit cold during work / becomes ENTJ as a CEO\n- Careless about some people's feelings because from my experience it's wise to do so.
3	ENFJ (M) and ENFP (F) relationships. Do they work?	I met an ENTJ guy about a year ago and was hit over the head with a frying pan of emotion and admiration for him: I have never clicked with someone so well in social settings and we made each other laugh for hours!! We kept in touch minimally, but recently reconnected in person and had the same (if not better) connection than a year ago. He told me that he feels the same way about the connection we have, and we talked about how we compare every potential date/SO to us and nothing compares. I would drop everything to be with him and I would truly feel like I have captured my most best friend and best lover all in one person.\n\nMy question is, are these feelings sustainable with how similar our personalities are? I️ have only ever dated introverts, and am nervous at how strongly I feel. I don’t think I will ever find anything even close.\n\nAlso, do you think that ENFJs connect this strongly often (even with such time between seeing each other)? Or is this truly a unique situation? Is a LDR something that ENFJs are good at?
6	I'm a ENFJ (M) and I am engaged to and ENFP (F). We've spent more than half of the past decade together. Nothing  compares to the emotional and personal connection I feel with her. She inspires me with her presence.

2	it's about what you want out of the relationship and how much of an investment you're willing to provide. MBTI does not really define intentions and relationships between people because individuality varies between person to person.  If you let MBTI dictate how you treat someone, then you're limiting yourself in opportunities.
13	ENFJ - How do I get my confidence back after a failure?	What do you do when your self esteem drops? I know as an ENFJ my self esteem drops drastically when I've let someone down, or failed at something or failed to reach my goals. That's what's going on right now with me. How do you other ENFJs bring yourself back up when you've failed and lost confidence? 
12	Talking to someone who knows you, who loves you and who you feel safe with-- to remind you of how much you are loved, wanted, needed and to remind you of how great you are. \n\nI think our type struggles with being human. We expect too much of ourselves. I believe we are too hard on ourselves. \n\nJust take a deep breath. It's okay.\nYou are probably stronger, braver and smarter than you think you are. \n\n
8	I feel you! I've been dealing with this for a while now. Even just the thought of failing leaves me in shambles. But I agree with what has been mentioned which is to have a support system and just let it all out. \n\nI also think it's important to feel your feelings. Be sad but don't end there. Once you're not emotional, change your mentality and know that something better awaits. \n\nGood luck with whatever you are going through dear! 
6	I totally get this!\n\nUnfortunately, personally, I will only get my self-esteem back when I “succeed” at my Next Big Opportunity. \n\nIn the mean time, I reward myself for little goals — and I mean LITTLE goals; and stop beating myself up for whatever perceived failures. I tell myself that “good (productive) guilt” is shown in actions, and not in wallowing in self-deprecation, pity, and doubt.
7	Nothing happens without trying. Failure is an indication of attempting.  Which is good. So go out there and fail some more you giant failure ;)
5	This is really killing me. As an artist I encounter a ton of failure and lately it's been really hard to get up. I been feeling really depressed and I don't actually have a ton of people in my life to tell me to keep fighting. What do you do in a situation we're everyone around you is more negative than positive? 
2	*Weird excitement and enthusiasm noises*\nI adopted a growth mindset and have exercised my solar plexus for a little over 6 years. I don't remember the last time my self-esteem fell.\nHere:\nhttps://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fbrightstarrynight.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2012%2F05%2F1vita-chakra-chart2.jpg&f=1\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMSILdW68zc\nIt looks/feels like a more realistic version of this..except you're not in pain, and it's healthy:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9to4tbQ11LU\nhttps://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.coetail.com%2Fwayfaringpath%2Ffiles%2F2014%2F12%2FGrowth-v-Fixed.jpg&f=1
1	Thanks a lot WP!
7	ENFJ Can't stop thinking (romantically) about an INTJ friend	Hi everyone, it's my first time posting here. A little background about myself- \nI'm a 17 years old female. Recently I've become interested about MBTI and came out as an ENFJ. I'm not 100% sure about being an ENFJ because I'm not really fitting into that "Generous Giver" stereotype. For my close  friends and loved ones I would do a lot but for just other people I know that's really not the case and I sometimes couldn't care less. I'm not that stereotyped kind , helpful and charming person. But I do relate to other ENFJ characteristics. So first thing i wanted to ask is if you can relate to that ? Does that make me less ENFJ ? Basically I'm wondering what other MBTI types are commonly confused with ENFJs? \n\nOk now to the point. I have this close friend which I'm 99% sure is an INTJ. He's really Introverted to people who don't know him well. And I think that in our group of friends I managed to create a language with him. He won't show off his emotions about things other than things he relates to. It's not like he doesn't have feelings , he just keeps them inside and won't let them affect him in any way. He's very rational, consistent and smart, and he doesn't ever do things that he's not 100% sure of. I really value his thinking skills, rational decision making process and all of it, and I really connect with him intuitively. \nI'm not expecting too much because I know he won't necessarily connect to my emotional needs , and that we are very different- but I came to think about him a lot lately, in a romantic way. I'm not here to ask how can I get him because I'm not even sure that that's what I want. I also know that many ENFJs connect with INTPs but he's more of an INTJ I think.\nI wanted to ask if you ever had something like this too ( ENFJ female - INTJ male friendship ) , and how did you deal with romantic thoughts about him as an ENFJ. \nThanks :) 
7	I wonder why at 17 you are willing to give yourself or anyone else any label.  These tests don't tell you who you are, but common characteristics of a personality type.  You will change over the years, and your personality is the emotional/psychological make up you have applied over time to adapt in your world.  If your world changes, so will many of your adaptations to life.  \nAs for your friend, perhaps just see him as a person and not a set of letters.  How you interact as people will be a far greater indication of your compatibility as friends or even lovers, but trying to figure out his personality type and then apply it to what you believe yours to be, is an exercise in overcomplicating life.  \nIn simpler terms, a 17 year old girl likes and admires an interesting peer she would like to know better.  That's the story, not the Myers Briggs computation of the compatibility of their personality types.  Go forth, be emotionally brave and honest and see what develops.  
2	Hi! I'm a 20 year old ENFJ female and one of my closest friends is a young INTJ male in his twenties. When I first met him, I was infatuated with his mystery and felt myself crushing on him pretty quickly. Over time, him and I have developed a great friendship that I think will end up being life long. See, both of our types are incredibly loyal in nature which is always a plus. We find ourselves being able to have extended conversations for hours and hours about anything and everything. Even if I don't agree with something he's saying or he doesn't agree with something I'm saying - we are both very willing to HEAR a perspective so long as it has value, facts, logic, etc behind it and even change our opinions if there is good reason to. This type of open communication is the key to an INTJ/ENFJ friendship or relationship.   \n\nI'll be honest, romantic thoughts should be repressed as much as possible because if you are too needy or overly attached (as much of us ENFJ's are) you will 100% scare him off. Build a friendship with him, a real connection, judgement free and if you still have those feelings for him over time... work it out then. Time and patience is absolutely key with this type of friendship. If you have ANY other questions (I'll answer any!) message me privately!! I'm here! :) 
2	I'm an ENFJ married to an INTJ and it is a fantastic partnership. We  have been happily together for over 7 years now. We work by not being in each others pockets - I understand he is not always going to want to do social things with me and that is okay! Sometimes when my "feeling" gets too much, he helps me through with his logic. I push his boundaries sometimes (for example asking him to do something social which he often dreads but enjoys when he is actually there). We just have to be willing to listen to one another! Communication is key.
1	Thanks for commenting 😊 now I realize that if anything those letters are just than a framework of a personality and nothing more. 
4	enfjs and right brain vs left brain?	so i came across this website about which mbti most most life brain to most right brained and they do it logicaly like this http://n3rd1sm.blogspot.co.za/2011/07/left-brain-vs-right-brain-according-to.html so istj is most left brained enfp is most right brained,im guessing it differs from indivuals but anyways, out of all j types enfjs are the most right brained,so how do you guys identify with creativity,i know as an infp the only people that can munderstand my creativity is entps and enfjs,and enfjs tend to be realy creative people,i mean when they joke around in social groups lots of enfjs tend to say realy creative and imaganitive things,even when i joke around ntjs dont realy seem to get my humor they tend to get irratated or pisse doff at me but enfjs tend to get it the most and entps,anyways how do you guys identify with teh creative?
0	i need an insult for someone?	ok theres this guy that iv been battling with for sometime now.and its not that im harresing him its just that he put me in a kind of a mess and i need his help to get out,he never answers my questions,he thinks his some kind of guru,or spiritual teacher,all my attempts to influence him to help me is like hitting  abrick wall nothing gets to him,i need his attension and iv said the most horific things to him because i just want at least 1 human emotional response but again brick wall.when he does challenge me its only about philosophical things,and ki\\lots of bullshit,i feel like something that would realy get to his core or crush his ego would hepl alot,....ok let me tell you what kind of person he is,very charming,well spoken with women,uses good language,the spiritual guru type.loves to insult me,lives with his mom and brother,father died some time back,long hair,good with twisting words around.....ok iv said it all,from living alone with your mom to full on swearing,........brick wall,im telling you nothing gets to this guy,and i realy need a response you wont get why dont worry why,.....but please give me an idea or something to realy break that wall or ego and hurt him?
6	Ignore him 
6	Sounds like that guy must be a saint for dealing with your harassment. Leave him alone, and be a nicer person.
3	"The best revenge is not to be like that." - Marcus Aurelius
2	this is not our battle to fight
1	INTP here.\n\nYou appear to engaging an INTJ.  And it appears that you may be grasping for stones to throw at the door to the Batcave.  Say NOTHING, walk away, and shut him out of your world forever.  His inner monologue is your only weapon, allow it to overload.
0	i noticed something about enfjs	so the enfjs i know are realy enfjs i put them through lots of tests,but they also my family members like uncles ect,and even the enfjs i know that nare not my family,i noticed they dont realy display alot of there 'skills' only when a realy troubling situation comes up?,even with friends and social circles they dont realy 'display' the hard stuff,like the manipulation the social power ect...why is this so?
5	i don't really know what you expect enfj's to be....\n\nIt's like asking why someone you classify as an ENFJ isn't behaving like an ENFJ.  Could be a number of factors based on what kind of person they are, what their values are, etc.
3	Does the ninja wear black to blend in or stand out? 
14	More about Compliments	Anyone else find "indirect" compliments more satisfying than "direct" ones? For example, I respond much better to: "You did an awesome job" or "I really like that thing you made" than I would to "You're awesome" or "I like you". \n\nNot sure why this is. I just feel awkward when a compliment is direct, but if it's about something I've put effort into, I feel proud and really happy. \n\nThoughts?
13	well that's because it's actually affirming and validating your efforts as oppose to straight up providing a generalized compliment.  They acknowledge your efforts as opposed to just providing a general compliment.
6	Personally I find that I prefer it because my sense of self-worth is directly connected to what I do for people. So if I am complimented on how the meal I made tastes, I prefer it to being told I am a good cook.\n
2	I find direct compliments less accurate, and therefore harder to accept. That's inf Ti for you!
2	Agreed. People tell me how great I am all the time and I just smile awkwardly and say "I try". I feel much more accomplished and rewarded by my efforts being praised. I pour myself out in the things I do and it's very fulfilling to have them acknowledged.
1	Can’t you just say thank you to the compliment and let it go without analyzing it?  I am not being judgmental, I’m just curious. 
4	ENFJ/INTP Relationship	INTPs are very independent. What would an ENFJ add to a relationship with an INTP?
9	ENFJs are very independent. What can **you** (not INTPs) add to a relationship with an ENFJ?\n\nI remember you posting here before with a similar question...\n\nHuman relationships are not simply a business transaction. Even if there is the necessary exchange of benefits and growth points and values, ingredients like chemistry, upbringing, culture, beliefs, preferences, are things that a personality theory simply cannot dictate.\n\nWhat I’m trying to say is, the surest way to fail with an ENFJ is to see them as a type, as simply a person who can provide x y z qualities — rather than a person with his or her own idiosyncrasies. \n\nIf an INTP (or anyone for that matter) came to me expecting x y z qualities in me because of what he read about ENFJs/ INTP-ENFJ online, and assesses my personality based on this invisible online yardstick, I’m gonna nope outta there real quick.
6	Depends what you mean by independence. INTPs can barely survive alone in societal standards.\n\nAlso, there are so things that are hard to do alone: sex, multiplayer games and so on.\n\nENFJs have LOTS to add to a relationship with an INTP, but you do not have to worry about that because I am sure the INTP will make you into the person they want in the relationship. We will see it as our responsibility to mold you into our pet.\n\nWait what.
2	ENFJ’s are wonderful because they take the best ideas spewing from our INTP fountains and make them tangible.  And when something breaks or skews, they’ll turn to their INTP for the missing piece and adore them for their insight.  I personally have no recollection of meeting an ENFJ that did not find a way to connect with me.  If a woman walked up to me today and said, “I’m an ENFJ”, I’d playfully smile (which is difficult in front of strangers) and tell her that after she can prove her claim, we will be great friends.  Game on...
13	Feel Awkward From Compliments?	Just as the title suggests, do any of you ENFJs also feel awkward when receiving compliments? I could literally give them for days to many people but when I get complimented, I just look down and smile and say "aw thanks haha"\n\nWhat about you?
10	Ahhhh!  Yes!  I think that for me, compliments have to be given under the perfect circumstances.  The criteria is as follows:\n\n-They cannot be from peers.  It has to be from my superiors.  This was probably because I was bullied a lot when I was a kid, but I was also smart as a whip.  So while my peers rejected me, my superiors/authority figures (parents, teachers, etc.) gave me praise for my grades, and that was the only relief I found during those years.  I think I became addicted to praise from superiors as a result.\n\n-It has to be for something earned and I have to have actually hit the benchmark of success.  I do not like being complimented for things I didn't overtly earn such as looks or the consistent amount of work I put in.  I like being complimented for reaching a goal, not the effort.  I recently was up for an award at work and was barely beat by another person.  My boss still wanted to formally recognize me for my effort, but I requested that we didn't make a fuss as "it would feel like celebrating failure."\n\n-I prefer the compliments in a way other than face to face so I don't have to stand there while my complimenter can see me consistently try to avoid their eyes.  I think this is because my brain viscerally interprets compliments as being placed in a position that is superior to others and maaaaaan I am not about that life.
4	Hmm yeah I have an ENFJ friend who always downplays all the compliments I give him. But I’m sure he’s secretly pleased!
5	Yeah I feel the same 😂 I can not handle it well 
4	When a compliment comes my way from someone I don't know I'll downplay it. If it's from someone who I know personally i'll trip on my words and then i'll just stop functioning all together.
8	How do ENFJs deal with rejection?	Trying to deal with being rejected atm. Any advice from fellow ENFJs?
12	The way I process it is perspective. Rejection is a good thing because the other person knows you aren't what they want, which is ok. You wouldn't want to have to go through the process of becoming super emotionally attached to the person, then 6 months later finding out that they aren't good for you and suffering worse heartbreak down the line. I see it as an opportunity to find a better partner.\n\nI also just kinda hang out with a ton of people and serial date to find that better match. Lol that's something lots of enfjs do to get over rejection. Of course looking into yourself and self improvement is a common answer
6	Rejection can be a great thing. The universe is telling you, "You finally know that your opportunity to connect with this person has passed, now you can finally move on!"\n\nI usually prefer to spend time on my own to understand what I truly like/ dislike about myself and the same in a partner.
3	Time will pass. The past has left, the future will come, and the present is now. So make sure you take care of yourself.\n\nIf I felt like I did everything I could to try and make the relationship work and was still rejected then it is what it is.\n\nIt’s a blessing and a curse, just make sure your on solid ground and be ready to pick up the pieces where they lay. I recently had to deal with something similar and it threw me off my schedule and it really tore me up inside. Yet somehow I met someone new by a chance encounter and things are better now. Take the time to feel what you need and take it day by day.
1	Yea like the user above, perspective. Tho I don't go for serial dates if we're talking about date, I focus more on my work and sometimes convert into ENTJ.
3	A narcissist is trying to destroy my confidence!	I always try to reach out to people and accept them, even the lonely narcissist people.\nTonight I was talking to such a person, he is complete loser but I take that shit, we were talking about something and I said why you are so arrogant? His reaction completely blown up my mind, he said: "I am not ........ and I hang out with you despite the fact that you are weird and when people see me with you this humiliate me"!!!!! \nAnd this completely the reverse image of the situation, because I have many friends in the neighbourhood and he is completely on his own. Plus I am sure i am not weird 😂\nThe problem we are neighbours, I will keep seeing him around :(  What I should do ? Ignore him or try to communicate again and forgive this unpleasant comment? \nIs it normal for such people to see their reflection on other people? Does any of you have experience like this? \nThank you ❤
8	Be cordial, but avoid extended interaction.
7	Get that ass hole out of your life. 
2	Well, if he is a "loser" (not my favorite word) and isolated in his community, he may be sensitive to the idea that one of his neighbors who is popular and therefore has potential influence over his already fragile social image thinks of him as arrogant - even if that assessment might be accurate. I would love to know what country you're in. But in most places it takes a lot of trust building before it's acceptable to so directly criticize someone. That criticism could be constructive if it came from a confidant, but probably not productive from a new acquaintance. \n\nHis reaction sounds like it was meant to be disproportionate to punish you for the way he felt when you said "arrogant". This person is sounds erratic and I would be wary of them. I think you have to be very polite and also keep your distance. In my experiences with persons like this, sometimes they will try to undermine you behind your back. No reason to make them think you're upset with them. Honestly - if it were me - I would consider *apologizing* (in a very casual and lighthearted way) and then keeping them at arms length. That way they won't feel any need to "get back at you". Just try to reset things. People like that freak me out, and I think diplomacy is called for. \n 
1	i would avoid the term narcissism. \nfrom what you are saying theres a conflict of perception. i cannot tell who if any of you is correct. but i dont detect any narcissism .. 
13	Do other ENFJs often feel this way in the Workplace	I'm in my early 20s, and this is my first career-related job out of college.  I earned my degree in Psychology.  I work with children and I absolutely love helping my clients and seeing them progress.  Whenever one of my clients makes an improvement or gains an ability, I cry in my car on the way home (happy tears).  \n\nAnyway, I love my job, but I also have a difficult time with my coworkers and supervisors.  They all seem to like me and we get along great.  Whenever I'm supervised I get positive reviews, but there is a very toxic energy in my workplace that overwhelms me. \n\nEven though I try my best to perform my job to the best of my abilities I become so incredibly anxious when I hear gossip about other coworkers and supervisors.  A lot of employees are disgruntled.  I constantly feel like I'm walking on eggshells and feel like if I need to ask a question or don't understand something I'll be fired.  \n\nI guess I just wondered if this anxiety surrounding workplace drama was common for the ENFJ.  When reading about how we're natural born leaders, etc.  I felt a little confused.  While I do get along well with my coworkers and know I am trusted by my supervisors, I also feel like I try to hide in a corner to escape workplace drama.  For example, I usually talk in a normal to loud voice, but my first month or two working at this place my voice would come out quiet and shaky. \n\nAgain, I love work and feel honored when people suggest I take on leadership positions (which the have), but workplace politics keep me up at night.  Why do people have to be so unpleasant to one another at work? 
8	Sadly, that is the nauture of most humans.\n\nThey are often envious, jealous, petty, and self serving.\n\nSome workplace are better at rooting out this sort of toxicity; some are not.\n\nI have left many jobs because I wanted to preserve my sanity and still have genuine warmth for my fellow man.  Had I been forced to stay at those place (either because I have a big family to support and really needed that salary, or because my career choices are limited), I can definitely see myself having a greater distaste for humans than I do now. It is a form of self survival, mentally and spiritually for me.\n\nIn short, there is little you can do to change how human beings are. Your best bet is to try to find another place of employment where the culture is more positive. \n\nGood luck.  Try to preserve your spirit as long as you can.
4	I have not had this *exact* experience since I work in the performing arts and don’t necessarily have an “office,” but I can usually tell the general vibe of any place I go and I can always read people well. I would trust your gut, as it’s almost always correct, and act accordingly as things come up. \n\nEdit for a word \n\n
3	Absolutely. Sadly this happens more often than not but I️ feel our personality looks to overcome it because we want harmony! Just focus the best you can on your performance and keep away from the negative nellies 
2	To answer your last question, the people who are unpleasant are usually just insecure. It's immature / petty behavior, and makes for a toxic environment as you've mentioned.\n\nI'd feel similarly in your position. I prefer everyone get along together, but unless I work directly with them, I just keep very minimal contact with people like that. I don't think every ENFJ wants to be a leader, though traits like desiring harmony and engaging people make us more or less equipped to do so.
1	I feel this exact way!!!! I started a new job about a month and a half ago, and my boss and coworkers love me, but when I hear gossip/workplace politics about how other people have been fired and why and how this one guy is like this total tattletale to my boss I feel like i also am walking on eggshells and that I should apologize for everything and I worry so much at home about everything that is going on even though I can be sure that I have job security. I think that we need to be much more confident and demanding of respect in general and that will help us. we are givers, and we don't expect much in return, and sometimes that can backfire. 
1	To answer your question, yes I do feel that way if my coworkers are like that. However I tend to twist the discussion, take the lead and make people talk about what I want them to talk instead. It takes quite efforts tho. \n\nMy suggestion would be : TAKE THE LEAD. If they trust you and you keep talking with them to gain more trust, you'll eventually become the leader when they're gossiping. That's when you can twist it into any topic you want it to be, or change their way of looking at it, while slowly persuade / convince / manipulate them to change their behaviour into what you want them to do.
6	INTP here - how to identify an ENFJ?	Presumably there is a very good compatibility between the two types and I just want to learn more about ENFJs from ENFJ perspective and not from online descriptions. What are they like? How to spot one? Which type are they often confused with and how to tell that they’re ENFJ and not someone else? \n\nAny insights into ENFJs would be appreciated, I’m very curious :)
7	In social settings the ENFJ is the person making sure everyone has what they need to be happy and comfortable.  Most likely the host of the party. You'll find them fluttering around from circle to circle checking in and especially near the wallflowers to try to make them feel included.  \n\nThey interact differently with each group of people and it may seem disingenuous but its just their way of making everyone feel comfortable.  Chances are they are one of the first persons to come up to you with a big smile and a hello.
6	As an ENFJ I think the online descriptions make us seem very obvious with our selflessness and wanting to make everyone feel comfortable. Often what we do you don't see and is in the background, and often it's very subtle. They will come across very friendly and smiley. They are very generous, very hospitable and laugh a lot. My roommate and I are both ENFJs and we bond over it a lot! We take care of each other and surprise each other with supper or whatever it may be all the time! That's one of the defining features of an ENFJ I think: thoughtfulness. They care SO much about how they treat people.\n\nThey are often confused with ENFPs because in times you may interact with them you won't see the introverted intuition going on in their head (the thing that is responsible for their sixth sense of knowing what each person needs and working out how to meet those needs). ENFPs are very charismatic and sociable but are very very different from ENFJs in the way their intuition works. I suggest researching cognitive functions! They get deep into the characters of types!  I recommend this one: http://www.typeinmind.com/feni/\n\nWhich type are you? You said there is a good compatibility? 
12	What do you think? Does this hit the ENFJ mark?	
2	It is accurate but I don't really see myself as a leader though! :)\nNice shirt, btw!
1	Yeah... I'd say it's pretty accurate.
1	Pretty accurate but not something I would buy. A pun or something similar would be cool.\n\nENFJ\nThe one that consults therapist instead\n\nENFJ\nThe emotional bender\n\nSorry buddy, a businessman here. lol
0	Does this hit the ENFJ Mark?	Found a cool ENFJ tshirt, was wanting to run it by my ENFJ friends first to see what you think! Does this Tee hit the mark? 
5	ENFJ with trust issue?	I met a guy,  he is an ENFJ.  We are exclusive for a week then I found out he has trust issue. He was paranoid and thought I was lying to him. I think it's some self sabotage things he is doing. \nWhat can I do to help him open up more? \nGive him alone time to think?
6	ENFJs extroverted feeling gathers all this information throughout the day on their social interactions and when they get time alone, their introverted intuition takes over and they overthink. \n\nI am an ENFJ and I have major trust issues. He may be backing off because he's afraid to be put in a situation where he can be let down. This may be because ENFJs are often perfectionists, especially when it comes to interacting with people-- especially people they care about. He may be afraid to let you in because maybe in the past he let someone in, or trusted someone (something ENFJs do too easily, to a fault!) and was let down. ENFJs take that kind of thing really hard. I think it is easy for ENFJs to develop trust issues because of this. \n\nWhat you could do to help him is maybe open up about yourself, then he knows you are comfortable being vulnerable, and maybe he will trust you more. Don't take it personally at all! I have a hard time trusting anyone too. I fall in love and crush on people quickly and easily, but often am scared to make it official and if things get serious I get a bit paranoid. Hope this helps! Feel free to ask more!
10	Any other male ENFJs have a really hard time dating?	As a generally fit and attractive ENFJ male I have a really hard time dating.  I get very invested very early.  I almost start envisioning my future with someone on the first date.  \n\nNeedless to say this clingy behavior repulses chicks and they are usually gone at or before date 3.  Any other ENFJ men or women have this problem? 
13	I've gotten so scared of being clingy that I've become decidedly off-handed and arms-length ish. Now most girls that I go out with will think I'm not into them, and will try for a bit more then forget about it. I've become scared to be close to people. I know there is a happy medium between the two, but I think first I need to learn to not rely on external validation for peace of mind before I can date people calmly...
10	I agree with Dr.Dog789...not that you HAVE to find an INFP lady, but finding an INFP partner certainly worked for me.  Before I met my husband, I was in the same situation.  I felt I was always giving 80% while the other person was giving 20%.   It's amazing when you finally find a partner who cares about taking care of the relationship the way you do. \n\nWhen I first met my wonderful INFP husband, I could not figure out what was wrong with him.  He was so kind and understood me on so many levels.  When I was emotional or anxious he'd listen without judgement and be the calm in my storm.  After growing accustomed to his kindness, I realized THIS relationship is healthy, normal, and fun.  All the other relationships were weird and bringing out the worst in me because I knew they were wrong on some level.\n\nI never feel like I'm being clingy with my husband because he appreciates my over-the-top way of showing my love and I hope you find the same thing! Just remember... if you feel like you have too try too hard to be appreciated, it's probably not right.  Also, remember to be patient.  It took my husband and I 5 or 6 dates over 2 months before we really opened up to one another.  He's a very reserved INFP.  My little sister is also an INFP and takes a long while to open up. \n\nSorry for the book, but I hope this helps :) 
4	Yess. I hate it. I feel like I’m so focused on long term goals that I wont even like a person if they dont fit into them somehow...
4	I go into all relationships with vulnerability. I’m sure to be hurt but when it works out it is worth the cost.  This ted talk by Beene Brown on vulnerability speaks to the idea.\n\nhttps://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability/up-next\n\nI know how this is from personal experience. Being hurt badly and also finding someone you can be 100% open with. Is worth the cost.
2	Find yaself an infp lady. 
3	intp here with enfj boyfriend. find an intp - as typically not emotional girls we don't need much but yall give so much we melt into puddles.
2	What is it, that zhe relationship builds up so slowly...	Hey male infp (19)  here... there is an enfj girl (17) i know since 2 1/2 years now... i think she was into me      since the first day. I was also interested in her (she looks very unique), but not that much that i wanted to make something happen between us (i think she looked to childlike for me [that isnt the case anymore], even if iam also look like 17 rather than 19)...\n\nLast spring and summer we had some eye to eye conversations... it was this moment when i realised how passion we both get when we talk to each other.  So i slowly got to like her more and more...\n\nNow there is something building up between us... even we ended up in her bed last week (she lives together with 2 other good friends of mine). But we hadnt even kissed each other (i dont know why, but i had those feels that she wanna go slow about us, but iam not sure) we just cuddeld closely.\n\nsince i like her more, i got shyer and shyer around her and i dont make it to open up to her like before and talk to her so passionate. So sometimes we go around silent for no reason some minutes until i through some unrelated bullshit in...\n\n\nI know it is an infp thing when it comes to realtionships that it builds up very slow. But this time it goes heavely slower than casually alltough shes an extrovert\n\nMy question is: is she still into me when iam not that passionate around her or is it possible that enfj want to go slow too about relationships when they love or is she even shy too around me?...\n\nAnd also maybe you got some advices what about to talk to her... even if you dont know her... like what would you personaly like to talk about :)\n\nSorry for my englisch. Alltough iam an infp i cant express myself via writing very well... sorry if this text is very confusing
2	I prefer to take things slow and steady rather than passionate and  quick kind of relationship.\nAnd I'm also very quiet around my crush. (Because i keep thinking the what ifs)\nSo maybe this kind of resolved your question (I hope)\n
0	why do enfjs get all teh girls?	theres this one guy in my neigbourhood who isnt the best looking guy out there,but his litteraly slept with all the girls in my erea,and weirdly alot of the guys,but anyways what is it about enfjs that get so many women?is it there confidence?,i also now this other enfj who is a pastor and in his younger days had plenty of women..i mean alot?he has like children all over the show,he was also married twice without his wife knowing?lol,not taking it seriously but just want some opinions or what you enfj guys do when appraoching women??
3	They know how people feel easily because of their introverted intuition combined with the observations they gather because of their extroverted feeling! They are very open and honest with their feelings and thoughts. They are extremely charming because of this. Girls probably perceive this guy as a "sensitive guy" because he is open and willing to talk about these things. I am a female ENFJ and I never have a hard time flirting. I am not ashamed to go further flirting than most types are. Hope this helps! :)
1	From my own experience as ENFJ ; \n\n- Excellent in understanding people emotion and thoughts\n\n- Have unquenchable desire to make people happy and feel valuable\n\n- Work to fulfil that desire\n\n- Good at controlling people's emotion since ENFJ is genuinely interested in nearly everything about people; mainly emotion and thought.\n\n- Be sensitive, well.. Girls in general are emotionally virgin. So being one will make me seen caring and very understanding, gentleman but bad boy or whatever people call that.\n\n\nAs a result, ENFJs get people do what they want them to do.\n\nWhat I do;\n\n- Be myself. Deeply genuinely sincerely interested with human and their emotions.\n\n- Focus on them and show that I'm really interested with them. I always find myself focus on someone who's telling a story but nobody else is listening. I ask for more and more, deeper until no details left when someone eagerly wants to share her story. Tho I'm genuinely care.\n\n- Be indirect when I want to open some sensitive topics. I give them choices if they want to avoid it but I also arrange the word, set a specific tone and body language in such a way to make them feel it's ok to open it even just a little bit. Then slowly deeper from day to day. Consider these as well ; time, location and situation.\n\n- Open about myself too with some seems-like-blackmailable secrets but actually it's not blackmailable, only secrets. To tell them that I'm comfortable enough to trust them, so they can consider to be comfortable enough to trust me as well.\n\n- Control my image. Even though I'm open I don't tell few things that can tarnish or lower down my image. If they ask I'll answer with 2nd reason since the 1st reason is embarrassing. This way people will keep seeing me as someone with weakness, but still cool. But the stronger the bond the more I open the embarrassing part of me.\n\n- Be caring and suggestive when they need or request.\n\n- Be the funky, funny, flirtatious but actually serious and give deep thought when one to one discussion, uphold to moral value but not forceful against people with opposite values or principles.\n\n- Be the guy they want me to be but later on when they fall for me, I'll slowly persuade them to change themselves into the people I want them to be (idealized character) while I'm slowly going back to my most comfortable self (the old me) and make them accept the changes. Call it manipulation or anything. \n\n- Be the leader, the listener, the lover (lol what).
3	programmer: help locking down my functions?	Sooooo, I'm a programmer, which is apparently a weird profession for ENFJs...and at the same time one their thinking style is good for, from something I read on here a little bit ago. \n\nI read a profile again today, and it looked like this kind of logical profession ought to be one that I'd want to get out of, but I don't really feel that way. I'm trying to figure out if I've mis-typed myself or if something is borderline or something.\n\nI'm self-employed, so I suppose that there's quite a social element to my programming work. I currently subcontract on a team, and I'm fairly good at extracting the actual requirements from clients when they're unclear (and I like to get them very clear).\n\nConferences/trade shows generally energize me somewhat, even if I don't like overly noisy parties. I mean, I can get worn out, but I get the impression that's more physical (travel/walking/exertion/sleep) than mental. It's actually pretty strange to me — I guess I'm a bit of a "shy extravert?" I thought I was introverted (I'm rather private about some stuff), but I've gotten ENFJ the most of all (I've also gotten *NTJ in other languages before a couple times). And the ENFJ result just got a bit stronger when I started thinking, "OK, guess I'm extraverted."\n\nSo it's mostly just the fact that programming seems so unlikely for an ENFJ that confuses me. When I read the individual functions for an ENFJ, it's not clear if they represent them or not, but when I read profiles about the type, they do match certain parts that the other ones don't quite capture pretty well. And if some parts aren't strongly developed, I guess it could still be right?\n\nWhat do you think?
3	I think you're overthinking it. No need to typecast yourself or your profession, based on personality tests alone. You simply do what you think/feel is right.\n\nThat said, I know where you're coming from. I thought I was introverted too, until I learned about extroverts with introverted tendencies. In short, introverted extroverts are people who may be resistant to attending crowded settings, but once they're socializing, they get comfortable fairly quickly. \n\nOur personalities are a lot more complex than we can type. MBTI, enneagrams, etc are all just tools to help us compartmentalize certain traits. When it comes down to it, we are not our personality types. We're individuals. Keep doing what makes you happy. Industries evolve all the time, so what these tests have traditionally predicted as appropriate fields aren't necessarily accurate for everyone.
1	I am also ENFJ who doing master degree in computer science and was Software testing engineer,,, and totally like it 😁 you're not alone 😃
1	I'm an ENFJ software developer. I read at some point that it's pretty common for us to gravitate towards this type of job because of our inferior Ti. \n\nI really love actual code writing. I find it relaxing. I think that's normal for an ENFJ- we like problem solving. If we can go at our own pace, I think we're even pretty good at it. I also like the theoretical architecting and planning phase of a project in the beginning and I think that's where I really shine, thanks to Ni.\n\nThat said, this job drives me crazy in a lot of ways and I think that's why they don't generally recommend it for ENFJs. When I'm doing something new and challenging, I love it. But I have an extremely difficult time motivating myself to do anything routine, monotonous, or mundane. Also, details. \n\nI'm a project manager and the details, man... I manage the best that I can, but inevitably miss stuff and then my perfectionistic (inferior) Ti causes a ton of stress and negativity in my life. It bleeds into my non-work life.\n\nI also have a really hard time delegating (this has come up in every review I've had since I started... ) because of my high standards and because the idea of something going wrong and a customer being upset with me makes me insane.\n\nMy bosses all praise my work, say I'm doing exceptionally well, etc... But I can't help but feel like I suck. The job- with all the details and the inevitable issues- just constantly aggravates my weakest point.\n\nMy boyfriend is an INTP who works at the same place and it's blatantly obvious how much more suited to the job he is than I am. It's totally natural to him. He has none of the stresses and worries that I do.\n\nI love/hate it. The hate is winning right now. I'm trying to work myself into more of a support/education/training role because I think that's where all my talents convene best. \n\nAnyway, I don't think you're weird! I understand both sides- why you would love it as an ENFJ but also how it can really not be a good fit for ENFJs in a lot of cases.
1	I am infj. I relate to all you say about programming. I did it for years (have BS degree in CS), but I mostly like designing databases, process flow, developing the plan that solves the business problem, and some UI design. Let some intj do the coding.  They are better at it.  I also am easily frustrated and annoyed by all the Software patches, plugins, and fixes that never seem to work the first time.   Im talking software from large corporations that breaks or doesn’t work because of some other companies software broke theirs, or they didn’t test their software enough, or they push out Alpha code as production ready and expect their customers to debug it for them. Things didn’t use to be that way. In fact, the exact opposite. Easy downloading made it too easy to push out code that’s not quite ready. 
7	What makes ENFJs love INFPs	Hello, ENFJs. \nI ask this question because you know INFPs have tendencies to have mental problems.\n\nAnd in my case, I have serious 6 disorders such as PTSD, etc.\nI'm coping for many years and I don't really think it will go away because I lived a pretty extreme life (I was shortly a signed artist, shortly a singing teacher, and shortly an air hostess) \nAnd other heartbreaks and betrayals since childhood.\nSo, I have low self-esteem. I'm emotional. When I get into liking someone, I subconsciously sabotage it.\nBut he(ENFJ) seems to don't mind all that even when he saw me broke down because I missed my dose(lol)\n\nThe thing is I don't understand how you guys can love someone who is so broken.\n\nWhat's so special about INFP?\n\nI only know that he said he is very comfortable with me and never feel like he has to make uncomfortable changes around me, I look pretty and he likes my singing.  All these shouldn't make somebody accept the way I am 😂\n\nI'm asking this out of my insecurities , of course.\nBut don't worry guys, I've been seeing both doctor and therapist for years now. I'm weird sometimes but I also have knowledges of why I do somethings.\n\nI just really want to know if this is real.\nLike, what qualities in INFP , even a wreck ones , attracted such a wonderful ENFJ. :)\n\nFYI We're exclusive.\nAnd he is a very mentally healthy person. \n
13	The strongest pull I would say for enfjs is to help those in need and to see in people their greatest potential. We are attracted to problems naturally and want to be solve them. It's easier to solve other people's problems than understand your own. But in the process of helping others we often discover something about ourselves. Both are share the "N" for intuition and "F" for feeling which I think are the core similarities. There is an instant familiarity. As for introversion and extroversion, opposites attract. Enfjs want to ease introverts out of their isolation. Eventually they do, people often change back and forth depending on circumstances. My favorite quality in a partner being an enfj would be "p". Having two people with "j" is an overload at times, and I love the thought process of those with "p". It's soothing and comforting. Ultimately both of you are validating each other, and it's a beautiful thing, a harmony between you two. 
7	My crush and probably my first love is an INFP. Aside from being absolutely beautiful, being very intelligent, being able to sing, and dance, she is a very hurting person. She has anxiety, always feels the need to have everyone like her, and tends to not be herself in social situations.\n\nBut to her, I make her feel comfortable and I'm very non-judgmental and act silly, making her genuine in her silly talk and funny dances. I've opened myself to her just like how she's opened herself with me and tend to be the first person she comes to for advice because I'm able to make her feel like the world's not ending.\n\nShe just feels like she doesn't have to put on a mask with me and that leads to a self-growth that is ENFJs live to see in other people. I love telling her about how amazing she is because she herself doesn't see it but that's it just takes a little push and self-reflection for INFPs to see their immense potential - and that's what we're there for :)
7	ENFJs love to help people with their problems! They also love people when they are open about them! 
6	Enfj are helpers! We see the good in people and want to help them improve.
5	You should ask him. I personally couldn't handle a relationship with a severely broken person. I'd make it worse. It seems like you have a very special person. He will tell you if you ask. 
4	Because ENFJ likes to help people. We feel extreme satisfaction in others' happiness and success after they follow our guide and advice. That's why some ENFJs tend to get into people problem too much. We're naturally that way, however can be improved.\n\nAnyway I tend to look at flaw as 'cute'. You know that feeling when you feel like pinching gently the baby's cheek. So I often end up calling them cute tho they like it *facepalm

1	Guys, thank you so much for watching! There were 30-40 volunteers all helping out for this one cause, and all of us really appreciate it, so thank you!!\n
2	different types of enfjs?	ok soiv noticed that some enfjs can be very np in there talka nd conosation in terms of off beat humor,like i know enfps and entps tend to crack off beat jokes sometimes stupid soemtimes bazzar,but enfjs out of all j types tend to do this the most,like i see two kinds of enfjs,the one type is mor eon the normal side,cracks normal jokes,then theres the joker enfj,and theres enfjs i love th emost because of there stories,just the stories they come up with is pure trolling,like enfjs tend to be very do things alot out of social norms even tho there fe is all for social norms,but its like enfj each has this unique character and the joker enfj is the best type of character.hey basicaly talk alot of shit,but with an artistic flair to it,like enfps and enfjs are very similor in terms of that off beat stupid jokes making

2	healthy and unhealthy\n\nedit: does that help chad?\n\nedit 2: what the actual...w-why, like what do you mean?
6	I don't know why I'm anxious?	Yes, I'm extroverted and I love to talk to people, but gosh I haven't been able to get over this specific anxiety over texting this person/crush for a couple months now. I know he's shy and more private.  I guess my mental block is that I believe he'll think I'm overbearing, or that I'm "coming on too strong", or pushing something...idk.  I don't know if there's another mental block I haven't pushed out of the way.\nI just want to start a normal text conversation and I know I'm the one who's defining this situation as awkward.  I just can't seem to do it for some off reason.  \nAny tips to get over this one-hit-wonder anxiety for this?
7	I’ve been there before with a similarly aloof/ private person, he was my childhood sweetheart...\n\nMy advice to you is to love yourself. If you treat people the way you want to, with integrity, how they react only tells you whether they are going to accept you how you are, and whether it is something worth pursuing.\n\nI’m not sure if this is relatable for you in any way, but unfortunately, for myself, it took me years before realising:\n\n* anxiety about talking to him was not love. It was me idealising him, having little self esteem, putting him on a pedestal because he was mysterious and wouldn’t open up to me as readily as others would\n\n* he grew to enjoy my validation and chase, and only spoke to me when he needed emotional validation. I hated that. There was absolutely no reciprocity in our friendship\n\n* when I started to love myself and met future partners who actually treated me well, opened up, etc, I realised how toxic my relationship with my childhood sweetheart is.\n\n* finally, I don’t want that kind of aloofness and anxiety in my own relationship — open communication is too important for me.
3	Look these topics are not easy to talk about and will not be resolved do to these responses. Anxiety is a lifelong battle. It's a result of childhood trauma. It takes a lot of practice to manage it and ultimately transcend it. The important thing to do is to acknowledge it, and use certain tricks to overcome it such as [R.I.D.E.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/life-without-anxiety/201110/ride-the-wave-panic). \n\nUltimately anxiety is a response to fear. Always ask what is the worst that could happen. Sometimes you have to experiment on purpose just to see the result and go, hey that wasn't all bad. When you get obsessive thoughts, it's important to break the cycle, laugh, change the subject, look around the room and really feel your environment, relax your facial muscles, feel something with your hands and go, hey this is soft, take a deep breath and remove yourself from the room. It has to be active. Your thoughts will go in an infinite reverb timeloop. Break the cycle. It takes a moment of courage. I believe the quote is that all it takes is 20 seconds of complete courage and you can do anything. Make that call you were putting off, do that assignment. You can do it!!!
2	As someone who was officially diagnosed with a social anxiety disorder, I very much relate to your whole post. I think the best advice I could give you (and myself tbh lol) is to just be yourself, and if people don't like that, then they should have the initiative to say, "Oh I'm not comfortable." We can adjust ourselves for people, but not to the point where we have to significantly hold ourselves back around them.\n\nAlso, I don't know about you, but based on personal experience, if the person was someone I really felt I could trust, the anxiety I get is much, much lesser.
7	ENTJ or ENFJ?	Hey! so i was doing the sociotype test and i came up with the score of ENFJ while MBTI categorized me as ENTJ, any idea how i can figure this out? What do you guys think? Ask away!
3	Have you read much into cognitive functions yet?\n\nYou have two very important distinctions between those two types in their judgment axis. \n\nENTJ is Te-Fi, ENFJ is Fe-Ti. \n\nThis is a decent view in function axes that’s also fairly brief: https://www.idrlabs.com/articles/2012/12/guide-to-jungian-function-axes/
3	Putting yourself into a category isn't important, the importance is getting to know yourself. Read the descriptions of the personalities and see which one resonates most with you. You'll very likely see a lot of stuff that hits home in both. 
1	From my experience as ENFJ and ENTJ (only at work) ;\n\nENFJ - More feelings, drama, sensitive, caring emotionally.\n\nENTJ - Not into them that much. Get work done buddy, work.
0	Also remember that this can change. You can be one type the first time you take it and another type if you take it years later.  Mine has never changed so it was easy for me. But most people fall into a couple of the types. You just may lean more one way at any given time.  The only other thing I can add, is that as an ENFJ, most of what I think is based primarily on how I feel or how I think others will feel about the situation. It is the main difference between me and my friends, none of whom are Feelers. 
3	ENFJ What makes a person interesting in your eyes?	As an INFP I always feel like an outsider 
8	To me an interesting person is someone who has a passion for something and can teach me something new. Someone who is positive,  forward thinking, and wants to learn and aquire new information.  
7	Individuality, maybe you care about something I don’t or have a different stance on a topic. Sharing it with me and teaching me why you care about it. Sharing pieces of your life with me that maybe you don’t tell others. Sense of humor is also a big thing. \nI love when people teach me about stuff I don’t know about. 
6	Worldly, assertive, confident, secure — someone who knows how to give a fuck about the right things, and does not give a fuck about anything outside of it.
6	Someone who expresses their feelings to me as a close friend, and have admirable qualities such as being honest and caring for everybody no matter their background and who don't judge me just because they don't agree with me. Also, extroverts are attractive to me only if they are respectful to everyone and aren't excluding anyone who is shy and quiet. People who have talents and share things about them with me and trust me too. Also as one of the sensitive types, I can't help but admire how other types receive negative comments or nasty looks but they go for the things they are most passionate about and endure through it, this really is something  I like.
3	As an ENFJ, I love a people with big dreams and aspirations and that are willing to talk about them! If you open up about anything, we will be all in and all ears! We love to help people with problems. If you are trying to strike up conversation, then get them talking about themselves, or ask big deep questions relating to people, or the world as they perceive it. 
1	As an ENFJ I tend to be attracted to INTPs because our opposite qualities are often quite complementary. I find conversations with someone more introverted tend to be more intelligent and thoughtful, perhaps because they spend so much time with their own thoughts. Perhaps I like the “challenge” of getting to know someone who isn’t necessarily forthcoming because it means more to me when they do open up. 
16	Are you a hufflepuff too?	Just curious about ENFJ Harry Potter fans on here and their house. The sorting hat quiz is [here](https://pottermore.com).\n\n>‘You might belong in Hufflepuff,\n>Where they are just and loyal,\n>Those patient Hufflepuffs are true\n>And unafraid of toil’\n–The Sorting Hat, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone

5	Haha yep... My patronus is also a badger. I am the ultimate Hufflepuff.

1	Yes. All the way.
1	Absolutely.
1	Yes! Of course! ^_^
11	What is our best approach to romance?	I'm a 24 year old gay guy living in London, struggling to find romance. Honestly, I'm not bad looking, I'm pretty sociable, well-liked and I tend to be the centre of attention in most social situations. I try to be as nice as I can to as many people as possible. \n\nHowever, guys always tend to be a little hesitant when it comes to engaging with me. I always catch their attention and they're always interested in conversing with me but, after a few minutes, I kinda lose them. I just think my personality comes across as a little too big and loud for them. I've tried my best to try different approaches, but I hate not being myself. \n\nAny advice if you've felt the same?
4	Maybe you're not sending out the correct signals? I have another friend who is an enfj, she gets along with everyone, and flirts with everyone. The same signal to someone that she isn't into that she is into. She's hard to read for that reason. Likely people don't want to upset the good aspects of a friendship and don't want to look dumb by misunderstanding her feelings into thinking she likes them. \n\nThe question is, do you think you're giving out the same signals to the people you like to be friends with as the people who you are interested in pursuing a romantic relationship? \n\n
5	I've heard people say our personality type can be overwhelming sometimes, despite being well-meaning. Sometimes it's because we offload/overshare too much, too quickly. Others may need more time to get comfortable.\n\nTry being more sensitive, and observe their social cues. Tone it down a little. Let others be the center of attention. It's a different kind of thoughtfulness - one that's just as important as being actively nice and helpful. Sometimes less is more.\n\nWhile sharing is all well and good, it's really crucial to show others that their words take priority too. Asking questions and remembering their answers may give them more incentive to continue interacting with you. The more conscious you are of the conversation, you are less likely to overwhelm the other person. Hope this helps!
2	Could you try going into a personal quiet mode once you see someone you are attracted to? I don't mean quiet like shy. That would be a strong hint and show your interest and maturity. Just an idea.
1	oh i see im an infp and i know alot of enfj women tend to be very strong personalities its not that you saying anything wrong,its just that you probably seem to high for them or out of there league,and that may be a nail in there confidence levels around you,thinking that you may be out of there league and wont accept them,i have had first hand expeirnce with this,enfj women are so socialy strong that i feel im not good enough for them and would rather find a 'dumber girl' or easier type girl thats more easy to be around
1	Are you sure you are looking for romance or are you in fact looking for Love? If so, don't try to be someone you're not. Be your awesome self and eventually you'll meet someone who falls for you. If you happen to (really) fall for someone, be honest about it. And then you'll wonder where that person has been your whole life, but that's just the way it is.
1	Some people can be intimidated by big personalities because they don't think they have a chance. Don't think for a second you need to change! You just need someone who appreciates your big personality. 
5	Would you give your best friend a kidney if his/her health is in danger?	Inspired by Selena Gomez's kidney transplant, drowns me into deep thinking whether I would lend out a part of my body if my BFF, buddy's health is in danger.\n\nDoesn't matter if it has to be a kidney, it can be your liver or something else.\n\nJust want some input.\n\nEDIT:\n\nbetter to have some explanation.
1	Family yes, friends no.
1	Depends on the exact scenario. If my best friend's actual life was in danger I'd certainly give him what he needs as long as it doesn't mean I'd sacrifice my own well-being for it.\n\n"Health is in danger" is too broad of a statement to give a definite answer. Would that mean he'd suffer each day for the rest of his life and would lie in a bed? Then yes. Would it mean he might have to go to a hospital once a week to get some sort of treatment and maybe some hours of feeling sick afterwards? Then probably not.
10	Tips for ESTJs wanting to relate better to ENFJs?	My two best friends are both ENFJs, and I’m an ESTJ. I’ve learned a lot about both of them and a lot about myself by putting our differences into MBTI terms, but in our best friend group of three, I’m kind of the oddball and I’m always up for insider tips on relating better. \n\nOne thing my friend told me is that trying to change her mind with facts will only make her dig in her heels, but trying to change her mind by saying I feel differently will work every time. Of course, I think she was being a little dramatic for effect when she said this, but it’s been very useful. I’ve realized that in disagreements with my friends, when they’re being stubborn and hurtful, the best way to get them to back off and reconsider is to be vulnerable and express how they’re making me feel, rather than argue facts, which is what I’d normally do. It’s been hard for me to open up in moments when I feel kind of attacked, but it’s been very effective. I feel like I’ve hacked the system in a way. \n\nWhat other tips would you as ENFJs have for people with S and T traits to help understand and communicate with you better?
9	Damn gurl you got it down to a T. That is absolutely fantastic and what I teach my ENTJ partner as well.\n\nI really encourage other Thinkers to read your post if they are interested in understanding how one can manage conflict with Feeler types. \n\nI would say, it is especially effective for ENFJs when **you tell us** how you feel, because personally I would immediately snap from conflict-mode to take-care-of-you mode.\n\nTo be honest, you sound like a great friend. I would say, be yourself. There is a lot that your ENFJ friends can learn from you as well. The world does not have to only cater to them!
1	Like the top user said. I've ESTJ like you, very caring and understanding.
5	ENFJ-Trouble with criticism	[ENFJ]Why does it say that we do well with criticism and actually praise it? I dislike it but don't display it, I listen to it and proceed to work on said area. How do you guys cope with the trouble, if any, with criticism? All other MBTI types are welcome to answer, (obviously I don't like excluding others).
8	Most descriptions say that ENFJs cannot take criticism though. To this end, I think it’s characterised incorrectly.\n\nIf anything, my problem with criticism of me is discerning what is actually constructive and what is subjectively mean-spirited, since I want to always see the best in people.\n\nI crave balance. I want to make people feel like their needs are heard and met. I want to make sure that I’m consistently the person that I purport to be. If anyone criticised me, I would feel really anxious to know what I can work on.
4	I don't mind criticism, as long as it's "constructive criticism"- something I can use to improve myself. I don't handle criticism well when someone criticizes me but doesn't tell me exactly what they are not happy with.  
4	I would break down into a embarrassing mess of a person initially taking it personally thinking it's a personal attack on my character but recently I've been working on weighing if the criticizer's opinion holds weight and if it does I'll work on those areas appropriately or disregard rather than let it feel like a personal attack. I guess it ties in with the idea that criticism could resemble failure or displeasure in another's eyes which is the end of the world to me (if I care about you)
2	Who said that ENFJs are good with criticism? They are probably the most sensitive type out there if not only.\n\nI typically despise people who "boohoo" you whenever you get into a project, or in a project and seeing some good signs. \n\nDisrespectful fucktards, sorry for the language, but yes I hate that.\n\nBy all means, fuck criticism. I don't think ENFJs can ever choose wrong path, at least I don't. I have "choosing diabetes disorder", I don't make decision once I think I have everything under control. Which means that 9 out of 10 times I do and execute the right damn thing. \n\nIf you disagree, that's your problem. Everyone has their opinions, I can't do anything about that. Good input, I would take into consideration, bad input? Go fuck yourself and get the fuck out of my face. Sorry for the language again.\n\nAnd seriously, most of the time you wouldn't really get "criticism" but sarcasm or something else, completely unhelpful. If you are talking about the criticism I'm thinking here, it's positive feedback, and that my friend, you would recognize them at first glance.\n\nTread carefully with comments coz they're mostly harmful. Think this way, on what par does the person have the conditions to judge you or your work? Did they ever do any research on the subject? Are they as dedicated as you on your project? Or are they just fucking "expressing a feeling". Most of the time you can just tell them to go fuck themselves.\n\nWe treat our projects responsibly and carefully, we are not toyers.\n\nAgain, I think I'm a bit over passion here, sorry for the language.
6	How do you see/perceive Introverted feelers Dominant (INFP)?	As an INFP I have a hard time sometimes understanding extraverted feelers and I was wondering how it would look on the other side.
6	For healthy INFPs or dom Fi's, they are inspiring because they hold so much value to their own values and feelings so steadfastly, that it makes me question if I am really valuing my own feelings or thoughts since I can be insecure and want to please people sometimes. They know how to separate their own feelings from others, are good at recognizing them, and understanding them. I am terrible at that and feel everyone's feelings as my own subconsciously which leads to emotional breakdowns when severe. It took me awhile to figure out that what I am feeling is not my own feelings. Sometimes it's still hard to discern. My best friend is an quite mature INFP (who is only 23) who is amazing at analyzing herself introspectively and she helps me figure out what I am feeling and how to approach it. Its great.\n\nSometimes dom introverted feelers can APPEAR self-absorbed/selfish/aloof because most of time they can be in their own head/feelings/thoughts but I know most INFPs are not like that at all. For example, sometimes my best friend would have a 'resting bitch face' when I talk about something really enthusiastically or 'outwardly feely' and then she would not comment or have a reaction towards it. Which leads me to think that I did something wrong or I was too intense or she doesn't like that aspect of me or worse. But then about 10 seconds later, she would tell me what she thought and how to make everything make sense with filtering through Ne and Te. She's very pensive in a good way. I can be as well, but I can also be too high in the moment. It's a great balance. It's like we mirror each other perfectly most of the time. INFPs and ENFJ's are 'mirror personalities' which means we play off each other's thoughts very well. However, due to almost opposite functions, there is some disconnect when it comes in terms of values or how we see the world a bit differently. \n\nOverall, we learn from each other and they inspire me. We have a really different angle when we approach human feelings and thoughts, but its intriguing and endearing to be honest. We provide each other different perspectives and while there are a lot of differences, it is not a bad thing. INFPs are awesome and make me laugh. I love you guys.
1	I tend to see them as depressed, artistic and broody. Quick to repress and then lash out and be hurtful. Into things for a short period of time. Possessive. 
1	A dreamer type, accepting of others but holds onto their own principles, usually creative (music or design), "old souls"
1	Sometimes I test as ENFP. Sometimes I test as INFP.  Sometimes I test as ENFJ. \n\nI'm not sure how that helps your question, but perhaps it informs my experience: I'm not sure I've noticed a difference between introverted and extroverted feelers. 
6	When under stress what do you prefer?	I was wondering if in a situation when you are under lots stress (work, study, family) would you prefer to be left alone or still be okay for friends to reach out and checking on you?
3	When under stress from college, I like taking some time or a small break to myself (listening to music, hobbies, naps, etc.) but then I get bored and reach out to my friends to see if they wanna hang out or talk for a bit (via text or video chat) if they are busy. I usually rant it out to my closest friends with all these crying emojis and expressions, but they don't mind and care a lot about me so its nice. It's actually a relief if friends checked up on me since it shows that they care, but too much of something is not good. If someone is constantly hovering over you to see if you're okay, then you're basically an annoying mom please stop hahaha, but I'll always love you. So anyway, I would prefer to have someone to talk to and laugh a bit for stress-relief. :) (and my friends need it too!)
2	Human contacts are always the best solution for a "social" type personality.\n\nFor example, an INFP can deal a great amount of "harmony coordination" for you and the people you work hard with.\n\nI find myself extremely inclined to coordinator personalities. I am mostly the doer, they can handle the situation better than I can on the verbal level. Then I can be left to do the thing.
1	its a combination of both. If they are someone that really recharges me then i would love to have their company. I tend to distract myself from my stress with social interaction, especially laughing and joking around. However, if that isn't available, i go running or eat some food or take a shower, usually all three. If my stress is really terrible I draw or craft. When I get my physical body engaged then I can't worry. 
14	What is our kryptonite?	I'm pretty sure it's cynics.  I just cannot stand them.  You give me anyone else with a large character flaw and I don't mind talking to them and helping them out.  You are a lazy asshole all the time? Alright man, let's find out what motivates you.  You have anger issues?  Okay, we can find out why you react that way.  But a cynic?  Holy shit.  My kneejerk reaction is to put up all my defensive barriers and mock the hell out of them even though I know it isn't healthy.  \n\n"HURR DURRR. I WAS HURT BY SOMETHING ONCE AND INSTEAD OF REFUSING TO LET IT DOMINATE MY WORLD VIEW, I TOTALLY LET IT WIN AND NOW I HATE EVERYTHING FOR NO REASON OTHER THAN I THINK IT MAKES ME LOOK LIKE A COOL EDGY ASSHOLE."\n\nI know that it isn't a healthy response at all but it just makes me really mad for some reason.  It gets to a point where if I see a cynical asshole main protagonist or featured character in a show or movie, I'll just watch something else even if that show is really good!  I dunno. Maybe I just feel it is weak to fall into the cynic mindset.\n\nAnyone else have a similar kryptonite or want to weigh in on this?
15	To me it’s not necessarily people who are cynical and their outlook, but people who hurt or inconvenience others unsympathetically as a reflection of not being able to work out their own insecurities. Which is often an action of cynical people you’re describing I think. So it’s the things cynics might do, not their overall attitude for me. I let myself be amused by overall “edgy” or “angsty” or attention-calling attitudes, but when they start hurting others I draw a line.
7	I'm your kryptonite, bb.\n\n*slides into 25 F INFJ DMs*
6	ENTP here and I feel the same way towards this kind of behavior as well. It’s so annoying when the available solutions are obvious but the person in question refuses to do shit because “what’s the point?” accompanied with the “I don’t deserve good things” mentality. Sometimes, the thing that they only have to change is their mindset. But then you’d get bombarded with the classic “it’s easier said than done :/“ which basically means they’re choosing to wallow in their self-pity and insecurities. They prolly wouldn’t even acknowledge their main character flaw which is that they place too much damn value on external factors that don’t even matter on the grand scheme of things.\n\n(Sorry for the long rant lol. Btw, I’m not taking into account things like depression and anxiety. That’s a whole different discussion.)
3	OH MY GOD THISSSSSSSSSS\n\nThank you, I never put this into words, but I get so irrationally irritated when I see people be continually pessimistic and critical of things. It's that one knee jerk negative reaction I have towards other people that I don't feel in control of, it just irritates me to no end, and unlike other personality traits that I dislike, I can't usually find a way to maintain my positivity when facing a highly critical person.\n\nTo me it just comes across as so disrespectful to be CONSTANTLY critical and pessimistic around others. Don't get me wrong, being critical is a natural trait in everyone, and it's good to see both the good and the bad of situations. But the people who only focus on the bad? It's like they don't want to put in the effort to find the good. \n\nIf everything sucks and life is terrible and you let everyone know it, don't be fucking surprised when nobody wants to hang around someone who views the whole world around them as sucky and terrible. \n\nBut what irritates me most is when those types of people then criticize more optimistic/peppy/positive/outgoing people as "fake" or "obnoxious" or "annoying". OH I'M SORRY FOR TELLING YOU GOOD THINGS ABOUT YOURSELF TO TRY TO CHEER YOU UP, I AM OBVIOUSLY A TERRIBLE FAKE PERSON, NOW YOU CAN FEEL SUPERIOR OVER ME BY TEARING ME DOWN TO YOUR LEVEL, GOOD FOR YOU I'M SURE YOU CAN REST EASY AT NIGHT ROBERT.\n\n(I knew a Robert like this lmao)
1	Agreed.
1	Exactly.
1	There are actually many types of person I don't like.\n\nI find it extremely hard on people who I can't talk to, simply can't communicate with. I think that's a no-no for me.\n\nIf there's a problem, it's fine as long as we can talk down to it talk about it. If you refuse to talk or simply throwing garbage at me, it's either I blow your shit off or leave the room.\n\nI despise stupid people and I don't have time to waste on them. \n\nBe peaceful, stay calm.
1	Isolation or being in a position where I can't do anything to help.
-4	stfu
7	What kind of people inspire you?	ENFJ inspire me (INFP) to be more open and expressive. What kind of people inspire you? 
14	People who are unapologetically authentic to themselves. I'm striving to find out what exactly I stand for since I feel I'm a conglomeration of my loved ones' values and haven't taken the time to suss out my own.
8	People who work hard at achieving their goals and that aren't afraid to be themselves. Also, when they have a passion for something.
3	To add to the topic: if you (an ENFJ) would be terribly depressed and left without any immediate things to care about, would ENTJ type inspiration be of any help?\n\nIt's like: "you're here, here are all the options, see how cool these options are, let's try this one and report back, you'll totally succeed, how about this one?, just stay positive and try to work on these problems, you have all the solutions at your disposal, I'll check in and see how you are doing while providing guidance."\n\nThat is the only way I know how to inspire people. Any ideas how that might work or could be improved especially for ENFJ/INFJ types?\n\n\nI barely can ask the question "How are you feeling?" - I'm trying to do it, but it causes me so much anxiety. I'm not comfortable with "feeling" type of conversations or questions.
2	Which MBTI Test did you guys Take?	Just like the title says - which website or resource did you use to find out your personality type?\n\nI personally took the 16Personalities but I have seen many say that it is not a reliable source. \n\nAny suggestions for other sources?
5	https://jupiter-34.appspot.com\n\nI’ve found this to be a lot better than most quizzes online, the only other one that comes to mind is http://www.keys2cognition.com/explore.htm but of course others might disagree. \n\nIt’s always better to research the cognitive functions themselves than let a test dictate your type though, I’d recommend only using it as a way to point you in a general direction of yourself though :) 
2	[41q.com](41q.com)  is my personal favorite test to take. You’re given forty-one questions, and each one asks you to choose between two options, a very straightforward approach. I alone can’t vouch for its accuracy though, but still I’d confidently say that its questions are far more relevant to MBTI type than the ones at 16personalities.
4	Personality and music taste survey -- need some data to back my thesis proposal	hi, anyone you take a quick personality test https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test <-- (don't need to create an account on the site)\nthen take a survey on your music taste?\nhttps://goo.gl/forms/lzqPk8jGD6oYXEy22\n\nWould be huge. Help me get preliminary validation for my hypothesis, hopefully I can post the results later on.\n\n(I know it's not MBTI ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)

3	People tell me i seem like I’m sucking up.	I really am just being genuine, but I guess to some people it doesn’t look some ways. What are some common behaviors that can seem that way and how can I still be myself without being a kissass?
2	Perhaps it's the altruism? ENFJs tend to go out of their way to help others. And sometimes others perceive it as unnatural, and therefore disingenuous... Worst case, burdensome, unwanted, and even a bit manipulative if they suspect you have an ulterior for being so nice. If that's your case, try holding back your instinctive need to offer help/compliments. Give the other person a chance to approach you first.
1	I've gotten that, plus "insincere," and "mushy."  Just be yourself and enjoy the people who enjoy you.
1	Can you not just correct them and tell them that you're being honest?
1	Just stfu and let people do their stuff.\n\nMost of the time, observe.\n\nYou will find yourself being a happier human being than before, and fulfilling.
1	People tell me they think I'm 'babying' them or I am so generous sometimes, it looks like I'm trying to suck up. I spent an average of $100 a person on presents for my (ex)boyfriend's family members, but didn't realize till after, that they may think I'm sucking up... Let them know it's just your nature, and tell them directly that you aren't trying to get anything out of them. :)
5	ENFJ friend losing their sparkle	My enfj friend is changing considerably due to a high stress environment and I am worried it might ruin our friendship. The situation is her first semester in a grueling curriculum at a prestigious university while being a single parent.  \n\nI've found her lately to be responding to me as I respond to people. Cold, distant, even dismissive at times. It seems she is leaning heavily on her logical side and all of the fun, interesting, emotional output from her is very sparse.\n\nAs an intj I choose my friends very carefully. I liked her for her sparkly, bubbly, intentionally caring personality. All the things I am typically not. I understand she is going through a stressful time, so I am giving her space, but I can't help but notice her shift in communication style. It resembles my own to an uncomfortable degree. Sometimes it feels like I am even talking to myself, which bothers me because I enjoy her friendship for the usually completely different perspective she brings.\n\nCould this permanently change her? Have any enfjs here had a similar experience? Did high-stress situations change you for good or did you just put your real selves on hold while you dealt with it?\n
28	You come across as a really shitty friend in this post.  She's going through a hard time and you're concerned with how it affects you.
10	I think I am way more likely to be cold, dismissive, and distant when I’m stressed out... However, I rarely ever do it to people I really love (family, partners, best friends).\n\nTo be honest, I find myself doing it a lot when friends are too needy/ obviously coming to me all the time for validation. Takers and not givers. I really hate that. In that sense, it’s not that I’m losing my sparkle; I just don’t want to share it with the person in question. \n\nIt doesn’t sound like this applies to you, but I hope it makes a bit of sense still.\n\nAnd no, I don’t think it would permanently change her. EVERYONE goes through changes, up and downs.
3	\nIt sounds like your friend is probably seriously overwhelmed by the grueling program, intense workload, etc. - it’s a really hard adjustment to make, and she might be feeling exhausted. If there are things you can do for her (bringing food, helping out with chores, anything that takes things off her plate) that might help her free up some bandwidth for her old self to shine through.\n\nAlso, I’m not sure if your friend’s new environment/program are ISTJ-oriented, but I spent over 10 years in an environment that greatly values and rewards those traits, and I felt like I had to  stifle my ENFJ-ness if I wanted to fit in and excel. This didn’t work, as you can imagine - as it turns out, character traits are pretty much immutable (who knew?!?) - and trying to be a square peg in a round hole just made me miserable. I wound up feeling exceptionally shitty about myself, wishing like hell that I could be more like my ISTJ peers, and feeling like being an ENFJ was a huge liability. Anyways, all this is to say that your friend might be experiencing something similar, in addition to the stress of being in such an intense and grueling academic situation. Of course, this might not be an issue for her at all - but as an ENFJ married to an INTJ, I at least wanted to flag it as a possibility for you to look for. \n\nI hope everything works out well!
3	As ENFJs we give SO MUCH all of the time without getting in return we eventually get tired. We know it's voluntary and you shouldn't give to get but never getting back wears on us. Make the effort to give to your ENFJ while they are going through this tough time and you will be among the FIRST people who will receive their SPARKLE  when it returns! \n\nBy "give" I mean listening without judgement and quality time. If they don't want to go out a simole "I was thinking of you - have a great day" text goes a LONG  way. We'll appreciate and remember it. 
1	I think she's just focused. It takes a lot to be as thoughtful as we are. She is focusing on herself right now and he studies. It's a good thing. I would do something thoughtful for her, like bring her supper or something, or chocolate? ENFJs appreciate things like that more than most people. Good luck!
9	How would you react if someone told you your reality is a lie?	I know this seems really nonsense but let me explain myself first. I'm working on a story where I gave this (conscious) AI character an ENFJ personality. It's kinda part of the story that he has to have his personality molded according to certain cognitive traits. \nEventually he will be told he is an AI and all his current beliefs are lies, and I'm having a bit of trouble getting his reactions to be realistic. I've read plenty of material on ENFJ but I wanted personal responses so that I can get a more accurate approach.\nI've read that the "inferior function" being Ti helps keep ENFJ on top of its game (as in adapting for situations out of their control) and I know it's relatively personal on how people would react, but I'd be extremely thankful if I could get an insight from you guys!\n\n-\nThe context of the situation is: character thinks he is human, he has memories but all are a fabrication because he never left the facility he is in. One day his code glitches, he start getting treated by a "doctor" and the longer it goes the longer he questions reality, then he finds out a "plot hole" on his memories and the doctor has to explain he is a machine and not human.
11	This is a really neat storyline, and a cool question. This would REALLY mess with an ENFJ, and I imagine that we would respond with a lot of purpose/ drama/ conviction wrt seeking The Truth.\n\n**First comes confusion.** I would be like WTF, all those emotions tied to past memories...how can they not be real? How can they FEEL so real yet all be a lie? Where are all these people now? Am I real? Who am I at my core if all these memories are not real?\n\n**Second comes acceptance**, and a very concerted attempt to answer the "Who Am I" question. That requires (1) sifting through what's real and what's not, and (2) trying to piece myself together without the memories that I once knew. What do I know about myself presently? Which of these people in my life now are real? What is my personality? (In fact, I think I go through this exercise in real life when I realise that someone I used to hold so dear/ highly has revealed himself as a completely different person.)\n\n**Thereafter and thirdly**, I think I might be okay letting go of the fabricated memories, on one very important condition: that I retain my current relationships with the people I care about, and that I am able to make new, real memories. \n\n**From then on**, my life would be one big unconscious exercise of sorting things into the "Real" and "Unreal" categories. I would probably be extremely skeptical, stop readily trusting, stop being as sociable/ accepting of others. I would have a mental checklist of red flags to look out for when ascertaining whether someone or something is real or fabricated. 
4	I've had a similar experience to this recently, essentially I came out of university and was questioning my whole reality. I've been in the education system for 17 years so it was kinda like "is this really the world is? Like seriously?!" I was just constantly frustrated, my emotions were in between states, this false reality you had been assimilated into and then the real environment of people and like this harsh cold reality. \n\nGetting outside of that comfortable illusory bubble is a big wake up call, filled with anxiety and depression and doubt and fears and whatever else you think. Think of it like an interior structure cascading to pieces, imploding... like the limbo scene in Inception where he needs to get back to reality. \n\nBut what is reality? What can we define it as? The chaos you're suggesting is a legitimate and very true thing, we are aware of the mayhem in our world but also terribly uninformed and manipulated. Use the media as a good base as to how they warp and frame facts so it has an agenda. Agendas are always important and if you can interpret motive then you can see the black, the white and the overlapping messy grey areas. The truth always lies in the grey area and if you can harness the conflict of beliefs and truth then you should have a really good piece. \n\nHope this helps and peace :)
3	I'm extremely solid in my worldview and it's something I give a lot of thought to, so I would just discount you as a crazy person if you said that. Unless you got me proof. Then I would still retain all my core beliefs and I would probably talk to a priest and my parents about it, about what to do, even as an AI xD, because my nature does not change the moral rightness, objective truth, or trustworthiness of those people and my beliefs. 
2	I'd probably be really excited that I have an entire new reality to explore.. and then probably become very suicidal when I find out that the people I love the most aren't real. I'd probably very seriously consider begging to go back to the place that I was in before I found out that everything was a lie.... And then than hopefully just suck it up, and continue living my life in the new reality I discovered, probably for the purpose of saving others in the same predicament (Not entirely, I'd also love finding out what the "true" reality has to offer, but saving the others would be the main driving force behind continuing on).
0	Would like to hear your thoughts on a confusing friendship with an INTP	So the thing is - I have this friend - we used to like each other and were sort of dating several years ago, but then things ended abruptly - he found a girlfriend in someone who was his best friend. We would still rarely meet and have deep conversations, he started to express regret and left his girlfriend for me, but already had plans to leave the continent for a couple of months. When he came back we had sex and afterwards I felt frightened (which I never explained to him) and started to avoid him, he renewed relationship with his former girlfriend and we stopped communicating for a while. Naturally we started to talk again, met a couple of times and had sex (this time he cheated on his girlfriend) and after a couple of days I said that I want to be with him and he said that he needs to be single. He initiated for us to meet and to talk about everything, but somehow we did not meet and again stopped communicating. A year or more passed, he now is together with the same girl he was then, we're talking again, this time I hope we will be strictly platonic, cause his intellect and insights have an immense value. Just the other day we met and were sitting and talking about some philosophical stuff, he then rested his head on my shoulder, hugged me for a long time and was holding my hands. It was innocent and tender, and maybe it only seemed romantic to me because we have a past. I realised it only after, that actually maybe that was not appropriate and there needs to be some boundaries for the sake of everyone. What would be his motivation behind actions like these? Why would he be so cuddly? What do you think about this overall? I could really use some objectivity.
9	this sounds complicated, would’ve aborted long time ago
5	> What would be his motivation behind actions like these?\n\n2 semi-gf/fwb is better than one? Also, independence.\n\n>  Why would he be so cuddly? \n\nHe likes you enough to do that.\n\n> What do you think about this overall? \n\nHe's probably not looking for setlling down and having kids, so if that's your goal, take the appropriate measures.
3	> What would be his motivation behind actions like these? Why would he be so cuddly? What do you think about this overall?\n\nSounds like he enjoys your company and is fond of you -- but might want to keep the relationship status as just friends [with benefits]. This on-off thing with you and with his girlfriend just indicate (to me) that he's totally not ready for healthy, monogamous commitment. This could be due to unintentional indecisiveness or deliberate screwing around, but either way he just sounds flaky and like he's leading both you and his girl on. He's either subconsciously being confusing / giving mixed signals, or is consciously playing with y'all (which would be a dick move). Sorry to be blunt but I am not getting good vibes from this dude (I am super attracted to intellect & insights and the ability to talk about philosophy -- but throw bad judgment / questionable character / shoddy moral values that clearly inflict confusion, if not PAIN, on others, into the mix, and it's a no from me). We're all flawed beings and I am honestly very accepting of flaws, BUT when said flaw fucks with other people for so long, and is potentially selfish WITH AWARENESS, I reach my limit.\n\nTake care please. <3 & sorry for being harsh it's 3:20am here I'm tired and all no-nonsense 
3	Might be cleaner to just sever ties with this guy. I recommend a final but open discussion in a coffee shop, or somewhere else relatively public, for a place to conduct closure (no physical contact, just talking), then parting ways. 
3	Sounds like this dude is a scumbag
3	Unless his charm and intellect is that irresistible, and you are open to being hurt and disappointed in the future as a trade-off for him to be in your life, then I'd try to find other fish in the sea.\n\nI do get that it's hard to meet someone to connect with, but there are over 6 billion people in this world. So the lack of me finding other connections is because of me (not getting out there enough, or go to the right places to meet people), or because of plain ol' bad luck/missed opportunities.  It is far different than living in a world with 100 people and you have already met 100 of them, and your fate is pretty much sealed.\n\nThe open sea should bring hope, and strengthen your ethics, if you are not into the whole cheating thing with your S.O.\n\n\n
2	>he said that he needs to be single\n\nWell there it is. He realizes that he doesn't want to be tied to one person and would rather be the floating free spirit.
2	Both of you are terrible at personal boundaries. It does not matter why he’s doing what he’s doing; you both fucked up at the expense of others and are toxic for each other.\n\nYou need to learn to love yourself. You are his “forever backup plan” and in denial about it.
1	Set clear boundaries that you will just be friends, if you value him outside of a romantic relationship. If you didn't value him as a friend, I would say to drop that creep. Sounds pretty screwed up. Sounds like a user. Be safe.
10	Troubles with Life and attempting to overcome them	Hi guys,\n\nI've been milling about Reddit the past two days giving a few people of advice, but as everyone else I have my own problems. I've had depression since I was 17 and I'm nearly 23 now, one of my counsellors basically told me that I seem to have anxiety as well. \n\nAnyway I don't want this to be a sob story as I'm posting to both share and help other people. So I finished uni earlier this year (UK) and was under immense self-pressure with high expectations of myself and my life. Kind of thinking that everything is in the right now-ness and that I needed all my ducks in a row, but it was and it is incredibly unpractical and unnecessary.\n\nI had three girlfriends before uni all kind of strung up in a short period of time, then fell in love with my best friend and a long story short I was wrecked up until recently. Numerous dates and attempting to rekindle that feeling with girls and taking drugs and getting drunk, but to no avail. Nothing did the trick, I think by part I was in a smaller town with the classic hoards of clubbers and not the more chilled jazz-bar-installation-art girls that listen to Daughter and Mazzy Star. \n\nAnyway, coming back home for the time being was a stress but after starting Sahaja Yoga meditation, drinking less, stopping the incessant tinder deletion and reinstalling, removing facebook and stopping smoking for the longest time since I started the pieces are slowly falling into place. I think the need for self-love is incredibly important and still not something I have fully processed yet, but I'm getting there. And for all those people who think you have wacked-out personalities, we all do and we're all fucked up. But out imperfections are what make us loveable and exciting and challenging.\n\nI'd love to meet a great gal at some point, but I'm not going to try anymore because that would be cheating for me. So I presume you're kind of at this point thinking what the bloody hell is this twat on about? Well I just wanted to let any of you know that if you ever need to talk and need some guidance in the short amount of time I've been around, my door is always open. I've treated people in the past in ways that I wouldn't like to be and I can wholeheartedly regret them in some ways, but in other ways I'm not so naive and glad I have some experience.\n\nSO yeah, hope you have a nice day and peace :)
2	You too.\n\nStrange that nobody replied.
4	Been stressed, lonely, and catching feelings	Hello my fellow ENFJs. I've been in a low spot for nearly a week now and was hoping I could get some advice from you all.\n\nI've been stressing with my coursework for some time now and it makes it more difficult because the program I'm in is competitive. If we don't get meet the grade requirements, we are immediately kicked out of the program. It makes it worse because my close group of friends are very smart and although I work very hard, I just can't seem to do as well as I want.\n\nThis stress has extended to me being lonely and living in a single room because my RA position makes it harder. I see my friends on the daily but because we are all so busy, we only just get time to have food together but after that it's back to studying. My group of friends almost all have some significant other and it makes me happy for them but also sad because I don't want to intrude on them and ask to hang because there is a possibility they would want to be with their boyfriends. My friends are 3 girls, 2 of which have boyfriends, and my former male roommate and friend who has a boyfriend as well\n\nLastly, I have developed strong feelings for a girl who is in my close group of friends. We've known each other since day 1 of freshmen year when all my friends and I immediately got close. She is special because of how we converse about our feelings and she is truly the most beautiful and intelligent girl I've ever met. We laugh a lot together, are very similar in the way we think, and address situations. But because she is so experienced in relationships and can honestly get any guy she wants (she has been single for about over a year now), I feel like she is way out of my league and it makes me sad and frustrated about myself in having a relationship with her.\n\nI like her so much and she always wants to talk to me and we've both opened about our feelings often and been through a lot together. But I doubt she would ever see me beyond a friend and I'm scared to put our friendship in jeopardy in case a romantic relationship doesn't work out\n\nBut I just can't stop thinking about her and it's been interfering with my focus and emotions. \n\nI know this is extremely lengthy, but any thoughts on how I should handle these feelings or what steps to take?\n\nTL; DR: I've been feeling stressed from not being able to keep up with my classes, feeling lonely from a fluctuating self-esteem and living in a single, and feel that a girl who I have strong feelings who has been close to me for over a year now is way out of my league but all the personal moments we've had together and her as a person makes it difficult for me to take any action with her.\n\nEDIT: Spelling
5	You sound like you're in a bit of pickle there. I think your low self-esteem is causing you the most amount of pain, and possibly the fear of inadequacy to someone you consider superior to yourself. \n\nI can tell you I fell in love with a girl like that, but by accident and I spent a long time getting over it. It turns out she liked me before I liked her, and when I realised that she wasn't (seriously sucks). \n\nSo there are two issues here: \n1. First you need to see that she values you at least as a friend, so she doesn't look down at you which is good.\n2. Your low self-esteem is routed from an underlying problem, you may not even know what that is yet (yeah I know it's a bitch, but things unfold when you ask yourself what's really wrong).\n\nSO, ask yourself what you really want, how you feel and if you feel that you want to open about it to her, do it. If she values and likes you, then she will appreciate the honesty. Risks are what keep life on it's exciting edge but you can gain so much from it.\n\nAsk yourself this: Is being friends with her enough? Because that feeling of desire seems ever prevalent, which means it won't go away. She's not with someone at the moment, so that's at least an opportunity without conflict. You don't want to hurt her, but you'll just be hurting yourself if you don't find a way of being happy. \n\nSearch your feelings padawan and you will know the answer.\nPeace and thanks for sharing :)\n\n
9	My friend who is an INTJ told me about a thread he saw on their subreddit, and I'd like to know your opinions. What fictional character (books, movies, whatever) best represents ENFJs?	
10	Somehow [Kent McFuller](http://leighlim.tumblr.com/post/166500338036/responsibility) strikes me as one...though I've been told that types do not form until someone hits their 30's.\n\nFictional Characters Over 30:\n\n- Alicia Florrick ([The Good Wife](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0-XmOepfkA)) - Reliable ENFJ\n\n- Diane Lockhart (The Good Wife/[The Good Fight](http://leighlim.tumblr.com/post/164711410491/supercut)) - Leader ENFJ\n\n- Carrie Mathison ([Homeland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvWR7rppBRg)) - Lone Wolf ENFJ\n\n- Jimmy McGill ([Better Call Saul](http://leighlim.tumblr.com/post/153299059116/kimmy)) - Rebellious ENFJ\n\n- Eric Taylor ([Friday Night Lights](http://sundaystorms.tumblr.com/post/58531383710)) - Stubborn ENFJ\n\n- Elizabeth Sloane ([Miss Sloane](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4540710/?ref_=nv_sr_1)) - Secret ENFJ\n\n- [Bob Parr / Mr. Incredible](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317705/?ref_=nv_sr_1) - Frustrated ENFJ\n\nEdits: Realised I mispelt Diane's name! Added Mr. Incredible, TGF, more links.
7	Without a doubt, I'm going to have to say Leslie Knope from "Parks and Rec".
3	From Game of Thrones:\n\n- Danaerys: strong willed, principled, highly moral, motherly ENFJ\n\n- Margaery Tyrell: manipulative, high politics, yet soft-hearted ENFJ \n\nBoth badass women, both makes me whisper YASSSS QUEEN when they come on screen. 
2	Also, I’m going to say Agent Ford from “Mindhunter”. He’s an FBI agent who wants to understand serial killers and is very eager to teach as he is to learn.  Very optimistic, a little naive, and open and honest with folks. Gets frustrated when people don’t automatically trust his best and genuine intentions.

6	How do you foster deep connections with others?	INFP here! I feel deeply about the people i care but i know sometimes i have trouble verbalizing. How ENFJ foster deep connections with others? and how you experience intensity and emotional depth? 
2	I like to hear what's going on in other people's heads. If you share your thought process with others, which I know is hard for INFPs as your thought process is extensively looking at all possible scenarios, that helps the down a barrier that you're don't put up on purpose, but is there. When you're so in your own head thinking through every little thing, how can others get to know you? Additionally, and on the total flip side, use your awesome listening powers, and observation skills to pay attention to others. Being considerate never goes out of style and can sometimes open the door to friendship! 
4	Psychology major here, hope this helps. :p\nBe as honest, transparent, and genuine as you can. Share your thoughts, experiences, and ideas. It's okay to show emotions. Its okay to show who you are. Focus on small talk first then get deeper. If a conversation gets too dull, ask open-ended questions and mirror the person's feeling or thoughts. A quote from ScienceofPeople says, "Talk to someone based on their personality, not yours." Keep eye contact, 7 seconds on, 5 seconds off and alternate. Get to know the other person's personality and constitution by talking with them and asking open-ended questions that give birth to even more deeper topics. Let them know you have good intentions. Show that you care about what they are saying or feeling, and when you are on the same page as that person, connections grows. Like-minded people establish deeper connections. Focus on the moment only and the other person. Developing your Fe is a good idea and is beneficial in the long run. What I found the helps with verbalizing and articulation, is to practice with your friends and to imagine you're placing words into the air in front of you and organizing them into clear sentences to say. Say how you feel about the situation and how it can benefit others or the future of the relationship dynamic. If you don't love someone as a human being and for who they are, you can never have emotional depth. Develop that connection. It starts small and can take a while, but will get even deeper. Hope this all makes sense, it's 1am and I have insomnia haha.\n\nYou can do it! :)
2	are u in love with an ENFJ something? \n\nWish you would share 
1	Hey, I'm an INTP too actually just browsing this since but I have an answer to this question that you might like more than the others. \n\nIn order to form a mutual connection between 2 people, person A has to connect with person B and person B has to connect with person A. If you are person A, you might feel a connection to person B, but they might not feel the same way. This is where *you fostering the connection comes in.*\n\nYou have to be connect*able*. Allow the other person's perception to tell them that you are a person who a deep connection could be made with. \n\nSo there's the abstract of it - how does this manifest in real life?\n\nJust be a likeable person. If you simply aren't a likeable person, you can still find people who will connect with you but it will be harder. Just be likeable and meet lots of people and the deep connection will come from there.
11	ENFJ - Depression/Love/Life	I took the test a couple of hours ago and I came up with ENFJ. Since leaving university I've pretty much be on a course of self-discovery as to who I am, forever searching for some kind of sense. \n\nI introspect a lot and formulate different elements to help map out my mind as my depression and anxiety has been a present force in my life since I was 17. In part I have recognised that I've been inauthentic, but I think that's part of my faults believing in things that just are absurd and the world is chaotic.\nI feel at times that because of my over-analysis and not living in the present has scuppered some parts of my own happiness, facebook played a huge part of that I believe (fortunately that's gone now). My difficulties lie particularly in the self-love department as you're constantly requesting people to accept you, but without you doing the same. It's almost like I'm living some kind of dystopian correctional facility when you look at your own emotions and say to yourself "life is fluid and chaotic and time is short so why waste it?".\n\nSo I'm forever in this state of flux of wanting to accept myself, trying to, asking myself to stop blaming myself and just churning in my head.\n\nI've found a meditation group has really helped because it gets you out of your mind and into a transient space but I need the instilled interior structure to operate without going crazy. It's difficult trying to strike a balance between productivity and living in the now because you're often tunnel-vision to those around you and act selfish.\n\nThe love department for me is something that is ingrained and I need that kind of balance to readjust me back to a more contented state but I find it hard to meet deep women that show kindness and their own mind (with a dark sense of humour and complexity).\n\nI'm a rational and respectful person but right now I need that push in my life to just get me out of this cynical place and into a vibrant reality.\n\nWhen I'm good I'm really good but finding that balance has always felt truly unachievable. The world is getting crazier and I'm feeling like simplification would be lovely.\n\nAnyone wanting to share any opinions, beliefs, wisdom would be greatly appreciate. Peace :)
3	You said you need to get out of cynicism and into vibrant reality... In my opinion, cynicism is vibrant reality. \n\nA cynical life view leads to questioning more of what you're being told, and ultimately finding out a personal truth after sifting through all of the bullshit fed to everyone by society. \n\nI'm one of the happiest people I've ever met, and I'm basically Rick (from R&M) but I try to keep the nihilistic stuff inside (because I find comfort in nihilism but other people find it depressing which is the subjectivity creeping in).\n\nEdit: you also asked for a simplification of the world. \n\nWhy would you simplify the world? It's inherently chaotic and absurd and we can't do shit about it. But what we *can* do is change the way we perceive it. \n\nLife is just a list full of experiences - you should make those experiences what you want them to be. \n\nPersonally, examining life's chaos and absurdity led me to personal comfort - no matter what I do, it's probably not as stupid as some other bullshit in the world. \n\nThe meaninglessness of life can be super scary - but I find comfort in it. There is your body, your perception of reality, and your reactions to reality. What are you going to do with those in order to make your big list of experiences the best that it can be?
3	Self-improvment/Growth penpal	Hi. \n\nI had an idea, that I want someone interested in having a supportive /motivational partner to work with towards everyday self improvement. \n\nGet to know each others goals and passion so from there set up small achievable daily goals and sort of keep track on one another. Pushing and set realistic goals. Have someone to brainstorm and exchange ideas about what could be done more efficiently. \n\nI'm looking for a person willing to grow and support. Like a shared journal maybe. \n\nI myself am an INFP. \n\nI got some points I need to work on and would love to do this self-transformation with anyone on the same mental path. \n\nI from Stockholm, Sweden. 23 y/o. Female. 
3	Hiya,\nThat sounds like a great idea! I took the test this morning and came out as ENFJ. \n\nI've been working on self-improvement since I left university earlier this year and am aiming to work on personal goals and a direction in life. I'm pretty bad at setting personal structured goals, but creating some sort structure is one of my goals (haha).\n\nWe all feel we have self-improvement goals and would love to share them someone. I've recently started meditation and started to move away from the messy uni lifestyle, to a more fulfilling one.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to communicate. I'm from Kent, UK. 22 y/o. Male. Peace :)
1	I like that idea. I'm an ENFP 28y/o F from Canada. I can't commit to the small achievable daily goals (or anything really hahaha) but I am 100% into brainstorming, discussing and exchanging of ideas to be more efficient. 
15	Can you live without love?	\nI feel so frustrated about this idea. It is hard for me to accept that there is no SO in my life, I feel more secure and happy when I am in a relationship even though, it is not a healthy relationship. \nIs this ENFJ thing? Or my own problem ?\n
5	Previous serial monogamist ENFJ here spending my first extended period of time single in seven (7!!!) years. I agree that we all crave to be the "desired and valued other" for an SO, but for me I had to stop and question if I really loved my partner, or rather the idea of who and what our relationship made each of us respectively. There was a lot of codependence and externalizing hard feelings that I couldn't unravel before. 
9	My friend, no one can live without love.\n\nThat being said, as a fellow enfj and serial monogamist, what I can’t seem to live without is companionship. I think it’s a bit of both, the nature of our being, and (for myself at least) the nurture of our upbringing. \n\nI am not proud of this, but maybe you understand what I mean?\n\nEither way, hugs. It gets better. Then it gets worse. Then it gets better again. Hold on
5	Maybe a bit of both? ENFJs place a huge focus on others, namely loved ones, over ourselves with an SO being a very close person to place this love and focus on. However, a lack of an SO doesn’t spell doom for every ENFJ because a host of personal and environmental factors so if you have feelings of emptiness that are ONLY filled with having a SO in your life then that would likely be a personal desire for intimacy that could be more manageable by drawing closer to your family and close friends. 
5	HELL NO! Haha :P\n\nI think it is important for anyone, ENFJs included, to know yourself and love yourself before you love other people. Never depend on anyone to love you, or lose yourself in anybody.\n\nWhen you love yourself, the right people will come along!
4	Definitely cannot live without love, but I can live without romantic relationships. This is because I have a great family, friends and exciting life that I am working towards career and interest-wise.\n\nEveryone is different though, and I am in a wonderful stable loving relationship now which is the absolute bomb and I wouldn't trade it for anything, but I've also been single for years at a time and worked very hard to figure out who I was and what I really wanted and needed in a partner.\n\nI think if you're meeting excellent people within short succession of one another, then serial monogamy is great. But if you're clinging to people and relationships because you do not yet have a fully developed self, then you might have to rip off the bandaid and do the hard work to find the right person.\n\nTo be frank, there's not much point in being in an unhealthy relationship. You're only selling yourself short and wasting time and energy when you could be working towards finding a good one.
2	I think our drive to help and please others can be overwhelming.  Unfortunately that can lead to unhealthy relationships if we don't know ourselves well.  It's so easy to conform to what will make another person happy; But it continues to make us feel empty in the long run. I understand your intense need to give your love to someone. Just remember that the most you can be for another person is their supporting actor. You have to be the star of your own life. (And to answer,  no, I can not live without love.  And it's led me in to 2 terrible marriages because I wasn't strong enough to be myself)
2	No, I can't live without love, but I firmly do not believe in happiness coming entirely from a relationship.  Like what everyone else said in this thread, it's important to have security and happiness in yourself and for it to come from multiple sources instead of just from your SO.\n\nFriends, family, passion, goals, hobbies and career are areas where you can draw validation and happiness from. If you are only able to be happy with a SO in your life, then more often than not, you'll find it really hard to maintain that relationship without it becoming toxic in some shape or form.  \n\nI too also went through a phase of serial dating, but that's mostly because I wanted to find my match and did not want to waste time pining over someone who was incompatible with me.  I was insecure and extremely lonely at some point in my life, but eventually hit a level of self confidence in myself where I knew who I was and was happy with who I am.  Then I found my SO and things worked out.
2	I think it's an ENFJ thing. As an ENFJ I find that it's so nice to be in a relationship, because I have someone that actually cares about me (as much as I do about everyone else) and someone who will listen and support me. However we find it hard to leave relationships. Don't put it off. I had doubts 6 months in about my last relationship, and I only broke up with him a month ago and we were together for 2 years.
3	Well, my apparent opposites, what is your relation to ISTP's in your life?	Precisely what it says on the tin. If you do not know anyone, then conceptualizing never hurts.\n\nFor me, ENFJs and I are an unusual combination. I feel as if something is just a *little bit* off when I am conversating with them, but it's pretty smooth otherwise. I do not know where that feeling comes from unless you all think about devouring my soul on a daily basis. In some interpretation, that might be true.\n\nYou are also magnetic individuals, and I don't just mean that in the friendly context (though included.) Currently, I think I have a crush on an individual that *gut feelings* say is an ENFJ, and I get this strange feeling it's reciprocated. The only confirmed ENFJ that I knew somewhat intimately I also held those same beliefs (and later was proven right.)\n\nP.S, gotta get used to the unnecessary capitalization in the title. Seriously, you all don't think that looks awkward?\n\nThanks in advance!
7	> For me, ENFJs and I are an unusual combination. I feel as if something is just a *little bit* off when I am conversating with them, but it's pretty smooth otherwise.\n\nThis is so accurate for me too. \n\nMy ISTP sample size is a mere 2, though. I like my friendships with IxTPs, they always grow on me even if they are a little aloof at the start. \n\nPersonally, as an ENFJ, a lot of people approach me for advice on managing interpersonal relationships. On one hand, you have some people who come with really open-ended questions because they are completely lost. On the other hand however, it is the ISTPs I feel, who are really clever and clear about what kind of personal advice they are looking for. I think they always have a good inkling of what they want to achieve, and just need help with executing it to the effect that they want.\n\nGenerally, ISTPs teach me a lot not literally, but by virtue of the fact that they are being themselves. And I really like that about them.\n\nPS; The capitalisation confuses me too 😆
4	I made this response in another post. My boyfriend is an ISTP. :) \n> I'm an ENFJ girl with an ISTP guy. Initially, I was really surprised by his result, because all through our relationship we always have felt like we are very similar. Turns out, it works really, really well because our core values are the same, neither of us gets aggressive or blame-y when we disagree (we don't even really "argue"), and we both admire aspects of one another's personalities and try to learn from each other.\nI feel like I help him emote when he's overwhelmed and can't bring himself to despite needing it, and he helps me calm down when I'm too wound up. He teaches me to relax and have fun; I inspire him to work hard. The more I think about it, the more I realize that in many ways he is the exact opposite of me, but we both are completely magnetized to each other. Hell, we're in a two-year LDR (started in person, then I moved home) that spans over 8 time zones and is 5000+ miles apart, and I've never felt this right in a relationship before.\n\nI should clarify a bit: he teaches me to relax and have fun in the moment, and I more remind him to plan ahead and think ahead. We;re learning from each other. Our differences show up the most when we travel, but in complementary ways. I'm the one who books and arranges everything and knows exactly where we're going. If something goes wrong that's out of our control, he's the improviser who can take charge and solve things. I guess what makes it all meld instead of clash is that we both come into it with a generous and forgiving spirit. :)
8	Curious to know if other ENFJ do this?	When I (INFP) brought up a conversation regarding my thinking process or how I do things, my ENFJ friend frequently says in a subtle complaining tone things like: “My girlfriend is not like that at all” “That’s very different from my girlfriend” "My girlfriend is the opposite" I find those comments a little confusing. Why when I share something with you, you need to mention your girlfriend in a comparison mode. Any insights, please!\n
8	Could be one of two things \n\n1. It's his way of trying to understand what you're saying. We like to relate to people/process new information by linking new information to old. So if his girlfriend is also an INFP he is experiencing confusion and trying explain his confusion by mentioning her.\n\n          OR\n\n2. He thinks you like him and is interested in him so he will mention his girlfriend as often as possible as a way to nicely say he's not/can't be interested.
5	If you’re a girl, and the conversation is about how girls think or do things, he might refer to his girlfriend because his girlfriend is his closest case study to how a girl thinks or does things.\n\nI wouldn’t read too much into it and I doubt it has to do with him being ENFJ.
2	You can tell him to go fuck himself lol.\n\n"Fuck you Jon, my girlfriend's pussy is tighter than yours."\n\n"WUT"\n\n"Suck on that motherfucker."\n\nSomething I definitely would try on my INFP BFF.
7	Picking up ENFJ's	That title was obviously a joke. Please don't kill me... Anyways, INFP here. So, I have a feelings for an ENFJ. We are pretty good friends. I don't know, but she shows some hints that she both is, and not interested in me at the same time. So, is there a way to get her to like me or getting to know if she does without making it obivous? \n\nWhat many ENFJ's tend to answer when I ask the question "any tips for getting her to like me" is "there is no shortcut". Look, I understand that but that is not my point. I'm not looking for shortcuts or anything. Just trying to get somewhere else than where I am. \n\nI haven't had much time meeting her (since we basically only meet about 4 times a year). So I haven't been able to show much of my "INFP-ness". So any of you that could give me some tips?
10	A good place to start is to see her more than 4 times a year
9	Personally, if I like someone I make it loud and clear. The ENFJs I know do too, but it doesn’t apply to all ENFJs, for sure.\n\nThere’s a reason why people say “there is no shortcut”. To answer your question more directly, no, there is no way to make it not obvious that you’re trying to get her to like you. So my favourite tip is...be yourself.\n\nHowever, to answer your last question, you could try connecting with her more, and perhaps even explicitly pursuing her when the time is right. People who pursue me genuinely confidently stand out because I’m usually the pursuer.\n\nFinally. Both of my “no” answers above are related. How so? \n\n* **One, ENFJs can sniff out disingenuous/ manipulative behaviours really quickly, and that is a sure fire way to be turned away.** \n\nIt’s easy to tell if it feels like you are “following the book”/ “taking someone else’s tip”, or just being your adorable self whether or not you are 100% charming or awkward.\n\nImagine if you took my “connecting with her more” tip. If you approach her systematically (rather than organically) to try to connect with her more, she might think “huh, what are his intentions?” She might ask you what you need help with, too, since you are suddenly making a concerted effort to talk to her which is unlike your usual dynamic.\n\nWhile I think you’re perfectly capable of executing such a tip well and in a genuine fashion, you have to then keep up with it. Which brings me to my next point. Anyway, I think I’m giving poor examples, so forgive me.\n\n* **Further, it is not sustainable.** \n\nIf she ever asks “why are you doing this?” or “why did you do that in the past if it doesn’t fit with how I know you as a person then and now?”, you best have a genuine reply, because anything else might be disbelieved.\n\nIn such a scenario, I personally would prefer honesty — “I really liked you and I wanted to reach out to you a bit more” rather than an attempt to brush it off. For some people, it might be even more endearing if you admitted that you learned it from someone else. However...\n\n* **All ENFJs are different.**\n\nI feel weird prescribing tips because what I like is not representative of what other ENFJs might appreciate, too.
1	Be honest. I know it can be really hard but that's really the best way to get through to anyone (atleast people in the -NF- ratio who are generally not afraid of feelings). Don't go straight out and say "I LOVE YOU!", but rather try to be open and explain your feelings to her.\n\nIt is not easy, it is very scary, and it is not something that can be easily done in a short amount of time. Opening up your feelings to someone can start a conversation that lasts weeks. However, I still find that discussing feelings is the best way to explore someone. \n\nDiscuss both your feelings for her and her feeling for you, and it will reveal itself if you are supposed to be or not. This is how I met my soulmate a couple of years back. It was three agonizing weeks until she asked me for a conversation during which I was sure she would sever all contacts with me but ended up kissing instead. \n\nTalk to her. Show her your feelings. And if you can't do that in words paint a picture. I guarantee you she will appreciate your honesty and bravery.\n\nEDIT: Såg att du är från sverige, det är jag också. PMa mig ifall du behöver nån att snacka med på ditt hemspråk :)
9	What type do you find YOU clash with most?	I find that, as an ENFJ, I clash a lot with people who insist they know more than me, without even knowing me.  It's not really about arguing, but really about not listening when explaining, I guess.  What types does everyone think that might be?
11	Hard to say exactly what types I clash with, but generally:\n\n- Extroverts: I find them draining when they don’t know how to shut up (like you mentioned, an issue with listening). \n\n- Thinker types: when they execute a decision on behalf of a group without considering the human/emotional dimensions of an issue. I find that I generally have the same goals and desired outcome as Thinkers, but it’s their methodology that I have an issue with. They lack finesse in political/social situations and I end up doing more damage control that was necessary. \n\n- Feeling types: I clash with overly sensitive people. If I laid it down to you gently and you still don’t get the reasoning behind it or appreciate my method of delivery, and then proceed to argue based solely on subjective emotions, I will get very irritated. \n\nSo I suppose it’s not a type but how a type acts on certain situations. 
9	Bitches and hoes
5	Probably ENFPs actually :/ and ENTJs. I get along best with ISFJs
4	I sometimes clash with Thinking types. It's funny because they're the type that is most prone to extreme anger / bottling up problems and then getting pissed off at everyone in the group. They can also get /too/ rational but at the same time place their own minor selfish feelings in front of everyone else. \n\nI also don't get along with ISFJ/ESFJ most of the time. Emotional and very judgemental. \n\nOf course, I have friends who are like that but don't fit this stereotype. \n\nI mix best with NF > NT > SF > ST 
3	ESFPs. We do not get along so great. 
1	Generally, INTJ women give me the most trouble.
2	ENFJ A VS. T	What does an ENFJ-A seem like? I think I've only seen a T with the exception of one A..and another T. AT&T Never there. Seriously, though, I think I've only seen 2 Ts and one A.
6	The 16personalities.com quiz likes to make stuff up. There is no A or T in true MBTI. Look at the Big 5 test to see basically how the 16personalities test is modeled. They are just using MBTI names because it's more popular. 
2	My sister and brother in law are ENFJ-A and ENFJ-T and it’s a really interesting contrast - he is a lot less sure of himself, softer emotionally and malleable to other people’s opinions. She is assertive, quick to make a decision and wont doubt her decisions. She’s got more ‘J’ than him, in terms of that organising streak. She comes across more powerfully and more secure than him. But both are awesome both separately and together. 
7	Worried about my ENFJ	hi guys, so I'm an INFJ with an ENFJ partner. (We are in a LDR)\nfor the past few months he's been rejecting spending (a lot) of time with me, like no more calling and less texting.\nI understood that, because he's in his last year of university and is studying very very hard for his final exams for accountancy. and also because we're in a LDR, it's only natural for me not to be a priority. at that point of time I was obviously unhappy, but didn't see muuchhh problem with that.\nbut it's gotten to a point where he hardly cares about his social life anymore. he hadn't visited his family in 3 months until today, and he told me that he'd very much rather study alone at home, and that he doesn't have the mood to spend (he really implied that he was WASTING) his time on his family. \n\ni would understand if I'm not a priority, but even his family and friends?\n\nhe is acting so unbelievably different from whom I used to know. aren't enfjs usually all about their connection with people close to them? what's happening to him?? do enfjs react this way when stressed? and how can I help? 
10	Sounds like your ENFJ is overly stressed and even possibly mildly depressed. If he is choosing not to be around people, emotionally he isn't ok. He needs to speak to a professional. 
8	I agree with the stressed comments above. I’m an enfj at university as well, and I know when I have exams coming up I’m not as good at communicating with my boyfriend (who is coincidentally an intj and we are in a LDR) at all. For me, stress really takes over completely. That means with family, friends, etc. He might also be dealing with some anxiety over the tests... again, this is just something that I’ve dealt with in the past. \nI would say the best way to help him is just to let him know you’re there for him, support him and are proud of him for working so hard. He probably won’t be back to his normal self until either exams are over or he just feels like he’s on top of his work. If it’s really taking a toll on your relationship just tell him how you’re feeling!! Since he is so in tune with your feelings, I’m sure that would get through to him & make him at least try to make an effort to communicate with you more. \nI hope everything goes well <3 
4	2 possibilities.\n\nFirst — he is stressed, depressed, and just wants to be alone. If this is the case, and if I were him, I would feel really frustrated that no one truly understands 1) that I am this stressed, and 2) exactly how someone can support me through it. Especially if they are my partner!\n\nSecond — he’s not into you anymore. What you perceive as him being “busy” is him distancing himself from you. If his is the case, it is likely that you don’t truly know what’s going on with his life.
0	Statistical Question	I hope I don't come off as a pervert nor insensitive nor rude. These are legitimate questions to test my perceptions. Do ENFJ women tend to have larger "chests" than women of other MBTI types? Do they tend to be on the heavier side? Finally, are white ENFJ women more likely to have asian eyes than other white women of the same MBTI type?\nBased on my perception, this seems to be the case.
12	What the hell?
7	No.  Appearance and personality type are not that closely related. 
2	Hahahahaha what a bias to have
2	Have you ever seen the South Park episode “Bebe’s Tits Ruin Everything” (or something to that effect)?  If not, go watch it and it should answer your questions.\n\nEssentially, because you find a girl attractive, you have a subconscious predilection for finding them particularly likable and influential also.  As a result, you are more likely to type them as a type that you find particularly likable also.
1	INFP here! Wondering where I would be able to find you wonderful people out in the world?	What hobbies do y'all have?\nWhere are you all usually hanging out?\n\nJust wondering :) \n\nHope y'all are having a great day!
5	Enfj here. In my spare time I'm going to events around town (bar crawls, festivals, charity events) or scheduling meetups with friends, either in town or somewhere else (we go to lakes and rivers over the summer). \n\nSome weekends nothing is going on and I sit indoors and watch tv/browse Reddit.\n\nI hate those weekends. 
2	I'm an indoor lover, I'm usually at the mall, cafe, arcade, and restaurants.\nBut theme park is an exception!!
3	Hey there! Thanks for thinking that we're wonderful :) As extroverts, you can find us anywhere where there are people. 
1	The best place to find us is subjective because the best place to find us out and about is generally with friends. Extrovert friendly environment that groups of people would go to would, abstractly, have the highest chance because for me personally I don’t go out alone (which would be either something mundane like a store or something meant to be alone like a hike) nearly as much as I do with a group of friends to parties or events.
2	Empathy & Secrets	Converting from an INFJ to an ENFJ has been an experience that I can only wonder if most people have. My father used to talk about what he thought other people were feeling or thinking based on stories he told. It was mostly assumptions, and I learned many of the same cognitive thought patterns. I thought I was delusional for a very long time because of the way I thought people were feeling, and their intentions. I learned a couple of years ago the importance of understanding certain aspects of people. So, eventually, I became fascinated with these delusions, and began writing down my findings about human behavior. I may never be able to analyze my father before he can me, and I will never be able to outwit my mother in a conversation. In a psychology class, I learned that certain individuals are more inclined towards this specific ENFJ quality, and that it is not a delusion. There are a lot of initial assumptions that are likely not accurate, and it can take time to understand something about someone.\n\n\nI think that everyone has secrets, whether they know it or not. Information withheld from any other given person. I believe that resolving the darker secrets leads to less hardship. In this case, ENFJ is an acronym that I do not think about much, but more often live. Sometimes the best option for humanity, is not to give humanity its own secrets.\n\nRegards,\nAnukisun
5	I don't think that's how personalities work.  For MBTI people can't go from extrovert to introvert and vice versa.  You might need to look at cognitive functions to determine what you really are.
4	ENFJ how do you feel loved?	I want to make my enfj feel as loved possible. I think i overwhelm my enfj with being a perfectionist. I talk about my feelings a lot and i don't know if that's good or overwhelming. Sometimes i just bring up things i think k need to be fixed or intuitions i have and i think he takes it wrong like I'm not happy when really i care so much i just want to fix anything we are not on agreement with. How do i bring up things or talk about things within the relationship without him feeling like it is something he's caused? Also what are just some other ways that make you guys feel happy in a relationship?  
11	If you're going to bring up an issue please have a realistic solution to offer. If we make the effort to fix the problem acknowledge/encourage it. If you want us to feel loved compliment us ALOT,  tell us how appreciative of the things we do for you. We love thoughtful gifts. They DO NOT need to be expensive. 
9	How do I feel loved? When someone shows me affection through smiles, through words, rather than gifts (I feel like I don't know what to do with gifts, like I don't want to owe you anything). A significant other being with me while I study or watch TV and laughs with me makes me feel more loved than someone who says "surprise I got you this book to show you how much I love you"
7	1. Need to be felt appreciated. \n2. Compliment us a lot; don't abuse our altruism. Appreciate it.\n3. Just go out and hang out (doesn't have to be expensive).\n4. We love gifts that are more personal.
4	Personally, my life revolves around taking care of people around me, so I would really like to be taken care of instead when I’m in a relationship.\n\nTherefore, If my relationship is based on my partner oversharing his feelings without giving me any proper action plans, I would feel very overwhelmed.
3	I often seem to focus on issues of conflict or disagreement because I want to fix them, not fight about them. But to another person, it may seem like I'm only attempting the latter. If your boyfriend is the type of person who is content with agreeing to disagree, I wouldn't try to "fix" the little things that don't matter just for the sake of a perfect relationship.
3	Great post! A lot of these have been said before, but appreciation and compliments are great. Also doing something small like picking up something he needs from the store or cleaning his car out-- I love it when my boyfriend does that.\n\nAs far bringing up things you care about, make sure it's coming from a place of love (which it definitely seems like it is!) rather than critique. If I kept hearing things that I need to fix, I would feel like I'm not good enough or doing a good job and my partner is unhappy. That would crush me. Maybe phrase it in the compliment sandwich format (compliment, critique, compliment) first talking about things you love, bringing up something that could use some attention, and ending with a sweet gesture or something could help.\n\nThanks for thinking of our feelings! <3
1	ENFJs above all need to be appreciated. They do so much for others that goes unnoticed. :)
3	ENFJs, how to do react to someone assuming your kindness is a manipulation tool?	Context - I'm an ENFJ (f) and I have an ENTP (m) friend, who is concerned that my kindness is actually a tool I'm using to get him to date me. He has had regular panic episodes about this and is reassured by myself and mutual friends that this not the case. Every few months though, this is an issue that comes up. It's usually brought up to a mutual friend before me though. \nThe question is this - What is your reaction like to these situations?  
7	i shrug it off. honestly if someone thinks that way of my actions, they have no place in my friend circle.  I'll most likely try to reassure them that it isn't, but if they feel that way then there's really no trust to have between friendship.  Your friend sounds a bit insecure and probably needs space.  I find it really inconsiderate to assume that kindness as affection.  If he's insecure about you going for him, I wouldn't waste too much time trying to reassure that's not the case.
5	...honestly just keep on keeping on.  \n...you can't control how they're going to react so stop worrying about it.  \n...they'll learn over time to trust and you're not going to be to make that happen other than just continue to be your authentic self. :)   \n...I've been there too so I know what you're going through - does put you in a weird position, but don't let it bother you - you know who you are.
2	What the heck, that would honestly really annoy me. \n\nHarsh to say, but I don’t have to time to deal with someone so insecure in that way, that they have to project their insecurities on my benign kindness towards them and paint me as a bad guy. Yet there’s this undertone of arrogance that he is so wanted by you as well — it’s so strange.\n\nBased on that alone, I wouldn’t even keep him as a friend, much less date him.
2	ENFJ (m) here, I'd say he's not completely incorrect but not completely correct either. Remember this song? This situation reminds me of it:\n\n    Kindness for weakness\n    Glen Washington\n\n    Chorus:\n    Baby don't take my kindness for weakness. (Please) don't take my\n    Sweetness for weakness. No baby don't take my kindness for \n    weakness. No, no\n    Baby cause our future depends on you. And no one else will do\n    \n    And every breath I take, I'll take another one for you. Because I \n    want you in\n    My life, now...\n\nYeah, so he might be taking it from the perspective that you're kindness is his negative coping mechanism (e.g. Safety behaviors). Sometimes, you just have to understand what boundaries other people have set for themselves also and act upon that. From there, you'd know. Empathy, understanding someone else's emotions (also knowing their boundaries) and acting upon that, is a key here as well.\n\nAlthough, I'm no expert at this. I'd would probably stay away for a while to let mutual friend(s) handle it a little bit as well better rather than dealing with the insecurities all by yourself, tbh – or all you can do is make it explicitly known and know what action causes your ENTP friend uncomfortable after a while; there's not much you can do really. The whole thing sounds slightly manipulative and way too needy.\n\nEdit: I'd recommend professional help really; it seems out of what you or you're mutual friend(s) can do.
1	I've typically found it's something that is (like you've identified) originating from an issue in the other person–whether that's personality type, historical issues, or anxiety, etc. Since that's usually the case, I'll usually listen to what they're saying, reiterate my point of view/reasoning (I imagine in your case you don't really need to adjust your approach or anything—it sounds like you're just being you!), and give some space. \n\nI (ENFJ female) am close friends with an INTJ (male). We've often had disagreements about things I ask or say to him, where he thinks I am attempting to control or manipulate the situation to some regard, when I am really trying to be kind and considerate or making small/friendly talk. I think part of this is the INTJ/ENFJ clash (he is VERY logical and rational, where I often change my emotions/responses to things to fit the situation appropriately, which leads to frequent disagreements). But in general, I write this off and just consistently re-explain my viewpoint and why I am asking or doing the things that I do. In the end, we are different people, and that's just how it goes. \n\nIf any of these things affect my friendships make me change my behavior in a way I don't feel comfortable with, I would start to re-evaluate that friendship. But that hasn't been an issue so far.
1	entp here\n\ni think the confusion is cause youre normal way of acting resembles the way we act when we're interested in someone.\nits just miscommunication if you explain that to him.\ntry to use this example.\npeople often she us as cold uncaring or like a sociopath.\nnot that we are.\nwe just act the way others would act if they were trying to be cold.
10	How do you ENFJs express your love?	E.g what words do you say, what actions do you do?
23	Verbally and physically, I would say. Lots of compliments (that are genuine but plentiful!), reassurance when needed and support emotionally / financially – whatever is needed, I'm there. Also, nicknames and general playfulness.\n\nIn terms of physicality, this shows itself in the form of lots of hugs, little kisses, back rubs and just generally being pretty tactile. If I love someone my love just overflows into my words and actions, I'm very expressive.
7	My love languages are quality time and words of affirmation. As an enfj, this translates into trying to connect verbally, and wanting to spend time together. I might ask a lot of questions about your day, or ask if you want to go for a walk. 
4	Most ENFJs are very physically expressive - I think I'm less so. I prefer warm, honest, verbal expressions, but spending time together or making an effort to help with something is just as important. 
3	I feel like sometimes it's more doing things and paying attention to detail and going the extra mile to make sure the other person feels safe and loved; spending a lot of time is key. Very touchy and verbal can come afterwards or when asked.
4	Maybe I am not that vocal but I surely do like to give gifts or to do something for that person. It's rarely something expensive but I really do put a lot of work and thoughts especially when it comes to birthday presents and such. I would rather make a scarf for someone (spending days and days of knitting it, picking the colors and the style) than to just buy one. Also, spending time with that person. Being extremely loyal and protective. Physically... Eh, I never dated so it's hard to say but I am very tactile, so probably a lot of little rubs and touches.
1	I love giving gifts and doing favors for people. I made this friend year in my program in collage and I've accumulate like 3 different gifts that he mentioned. It's just how I show my love.
11	Has anyone purchased the enfj premium profile/ebook from 16personalities?	If so, was it worth $33? What are some good lessons you learned from it?
15	[deleted]
3	No, I haven't, but I saw it briefly online when someone posted it. I didn't get to read all of it though because it got removed. :(\n\nIt had some insightful observations about ENFJs. It talked about strengths, weaknesses, "mirror personality"/dark side, romance, ENFJ in higher education settings, and suitable careers. That's how far I read it before it got removed. \n\nIt was a great read and very informative but I don't think I would buy it because most of the things mentioned in it I've already heard. 
10	We all care about others, but how much do you need appreciation back from them?	I really like doing things for my friends and often I overthink these things. It doesn't always look like they appreciate it though, because they probably don't know how much energy I put into it.\n\nIt is okay for that to happen especially because I just like the act of doing for someone else, but sometimes it feels really awful and demotivating to realize that maybe no one really appreciates my efforts.\n\nDo you need appreciation like that too and how do you handle the fact that other types don't seem to realize the effort we put into caring and giving sometimes?
13	I think everyone in this world would want to feel appreciated by people they love.\n\nHowever, ENFJs (and/ or enneagram type 2s) are “notorious” for not knowing whether they are doing things for their loved ones BECAUSE:\n\n* 1) they truly just want to make the other person happy, nothing more; or\n\n* 2) they want to be loved, appreciated, and needed; or\n\n* 3) both.\n\nFor me, it has probably always been both, and more 2) than 1) when I was a teenager. My goal is to be at 1) — it’s definitely something I’m working on! I want to be a helpful person and help others because I want to and it makes me happy — nothing else.\n\nWhy? \n\nIt’s not fair to penalise others for not reciprocating our *voluntary* efforts. It creates feelings of unjustified resentment for yourself. At the extreme, a resentful person becomes manipulative, needy, demanding, entitled.\n\nIn the past year, my relationships have become much better than before. More genuine, valuable appreciation. More time used for the appropriate things. Less anxiety. Less doubt. I never want to *need* someone else’s appreciation anymore.
7	Sometimes I feel like people don't appreciate the things I do for them, but then I think about it and realize that they may not be used to showing their appreciation in a way that I am used to seeing. I think people are still happy that you did something for them but they just might not say it out loud.
5	I love making other people happy -- appreciated or otherwise.\n\nThose people who appreciate the things I do for them, they inspire me to continue. I'd go great lengths for them.\n\nThose people who do not appreciate what I do, that's okay. But I won't stick with them as much as I'd stick with the other. I'd still do good things for them, not because I want to gain their validation, but because helping others make me happy.\n\n
3	Sometimes. And when my expectations aren't met, I feel a little hurt or betrayed. But I've been realizing more and more that if I go the extra mile just to get acknowledged, I'm relying on someone else to validate my worth and that feels even worse.\n\nI'm more careful these days about how much effort I expend. Some people don't appreciate the extra help as it can come across as smothering. 
12	I miss my enfj	As an infp i think once you know what love feels like with an enfj there really is no other relationship that compares. I think he is the only person that can handle my emotions. \nI dont know what i believe about love anymore but it feels like love is only a mirror of myself. \nAs i get older ive accepted the beauty in pain as much as love\nBut it feels like madness.
12	I'm sorry. Missing people is pure suck. *hug*
6	ENFJs are good at connecting with people. How do you do to connect with people who have a very different type of personality or little in common with you?	
14	I think we can connect with people because we know our boundaries: \n\n* whether to pursue\n\n* how much to pursue\n\n* and how to NOT pursue.\n\nIntuitively, one might think that you have to “try harder” with someone who is different. Personally, I think it’s better to leave it be.\n\nWith someone who is very different, you can’t force things. Let it be. Let it develop naturally. Agree/ disagree at your own pace. Appreciate your differences step by step.\n\nIt is often the very “different” types that I end up having really meaningful relationships with. \n\nWhen it is someone who has completely opposite values from me, I might even not pursue it altogether. I’d say somewhat harshly that some people aren’t even worth getting to know.
7	Sometimes, the best way to connect is through active listening. Ask questions if you don't understand. Show that you respect them with your facial expressions and body language.\n\nThere is always something to learn from others, especially when they're different.
5	So let me know if I'm wrong, but as enfjs our dominant function is viewing the world through the emotions of others. With infps, you go through your own meaning making and understanding of emotions based on your own experiences with them. Because we literally feel like someone is *dipping* us in other people's energies, we are able to cater to others the way that works for them fairly well. We often know people better than ourselves. I know some of my infp friends have more trouble with people who are so unlike them because they operate from their own energy first. 
3	I try to find out more about them by asking them questions and finding common ground. Also, I show that I'm genuinely interested in getting to know them. 
3	Wow, I never knew this was a thing. (I'm pretty new to the subreddit lol.) This is actually pretty interesting because I've always noticed how I can interact with both extroverts and introverts really easily. It's also pretty common that if most people in a group are extroverted and there's like one introverted person, the introvert usually ends up becoming the closest to me out of everyone. If there's something I'm doing to interact with a wide range of people, I'm not really aware of it. I guess one thing I do is I ask people what kind of music they like, since I'm pretty big on music myself. Almost everyone has their own unique taste in music and I often feel like I can understand someone better after knowing what music they listen to. Also, I listen to a lot of different genres so most of the time a conversation about their taste in music will ensue. \n\nI'm curious now, does anyone often feel like they are leading the conversation when first getting to know someone? This happens to me all the time and I always wonder if the other person is even interested in talking to me, since I'm usually the one doing most of the talking, lol.
1	My favorite thing to do is pointing out something unique about what they're wearing or accessorizing. When in doubt: tattoos. \n\n"Wow, thats a gorgeous tattoo, where did you get it done?"\n\n"Oh, are they here in town? What compelled you to get a tattoo in the Philippines? You lived there for 3 years! That's amazing!"\n\n"If I'm getting too personal please stop me, but does it have any meaning to you?"\n\nJust get them talking about themselves. You not only learn so lot about another human, which is a reward in its own right, but the sharing of personal information like that breeds trust. Immediately you have connected with someone at a deeper level than talking about the weather. 
1	I’ve found that no matter how different you are from someone else, if you talk *about* each other you will find something to talk about *with* each other. ENFJs love to listen to others and someone very different will give us more to listen to and try to understand. There’s a bit of feeling around for the balance so that they don’t feel like they’re shaking their life story, or worse, that they’re sharing their life story with a wall; we work to give some of ourselves too, but probably not close to the same extent as we focus on others. Before long, there are plenty of branches to choose from in conversation whether it’s something you found to be similar or questions on a topic in which you differ, and of course this can take place over any length of time depending on the other person.
1	- Listen\n- Observe\n- Adapt to their style in any comfortable way I prefer\n- Choose the suitable time, place and situation to talk about specific things.\n\nIf I don't feel like it? I'll take my leave.
7	Proposing!	Hello to all you wonderful ENFJs!\nMy girlfriend is an ENFJ and I want to be in each other's arms forever so I'm going to ask her to marry me!!! :D\n\nI kinda already know how I'm going to do this but I was curious to see if any other ENFJs had advice on the perfect proposal.\nWhat would be good, bad, dreadful or so f**king amazing it would feel like being licked in the face by a mermaid-unicorn???\n\nThanks in advance!
5	Something truly from the heart. Something she and you share intimately or an inside joke that always leaves you both in stitches. I love thoughtful surprises so don't let her know it's coming. Touch her heart and make her feel seen! 
5	Congrats!!!\n\nEveryone is different but for me, Make sure it’s intimate/private. As much as ENFJs are extraverted feelers, they are actually very guarded of their own emotions. If you ask me to be emotionally open, I won’t want the world watching. Plus, I find that there’s more intimacy with fewer ppl in the picture. \n\nDoesn’t have to be totally secluded or anything, but it’s a special moment in time just for the two of you, so keep it that way. 
4	I might be different from most people, but the way my husband and I became engaged wasn't through a proposal but through a conversation and both of us agreeing that it was a good idea. Being an equal in the relationship is really important to me and this way of becoming engaged made me feel part of the decision making process instead of randomly having the question popped at me in a potentially public and embarrassing scenario.\n\nBut like I said before, I'm a different person, maybe your girlfriend would like something grandiose.\n\nMy best advice is to talk to her about it and see what she wants. Maybe she'll even give you some good ideas of how to propose is that's what she wants. 
3	Well if you've been listening closely to your ENFJ gal I'm sure she's has told you already or swooned over seeing a proposal on TV or a movie. If not, just make it as sentimental as possible. Same place as your first date or when you first exchanged "I love you."
2	Something personal and thoughtful, with plenty of time and privacy. If it was me, I would be very moved and I would want time with my SO to discuss/squeal with happiness/celebrate. If you can make it something sentimental by connecting it to a special place or event for her, that would be even better. 
2	Congratulations! How sweet of you to considering how she'd like this moment to be. \n\nA lot of this has been said, but something thoughtful and meaningful from your relationship. I also echo it being a bit more intimate. Though we're extroverts, sometimes our Feeling quality may be stronger and we want that great connection and personalization. However, it would be really cool to have some kind of get together planned for after with family and friends so she can celebrate with those she loves the most. My boyfriend and I are talking about getting engaged soon and I've told him exactly what I'm telling you :)\n\nKeep us updated!!
1	Did you propose? If so, how did it go? 
8	Solitary Walker's ENFJ profile . I Highly recommend this due to the fact they go in Depth About the minds of ENFJs. it is pretty long though so take some time out to read it when your not busy	
5	Something I would like to add to this is that oftentimes, the Extroverted Feeler is aware of his shortcomings in the identity department and therefore will try to in a sense atone for them in little things. Never styling my hair is my little example of this. I refuse to do anything except press it down, despite a lot of my peers and also my parents wanting me to do something with it, and it's my little act of individuality that I can cling onto. Stuff like that I believe we could find to be very common among these types of we looked.

7	ENFJ men and ISTP women?	\nAny other ENFJ guys out there with an ISTP SO?\n \nIt seems like it's usually the other way around if anything (istp men and enfj women)\n\nIt seems counter intuitive dating your complete opposite but it's the best relationship I've been in so far! \n\nAnyone else find the same?
3	Wow! Interesting pairing, I am curious to hear. I mostly really like ISTPs. How’s your relationship like and do you know your enneagram types?
3	Well... you're right about it being the other way around. I'm an ENFJ girl with an ISTP guy. Initially, I was really surprised by his result, because all through our relationship we always have felt like we are very similar. Turns out, it works really, really well because our core values are the same, neither of us gets aggressive or blame-y when we disagree (we don't even really "argue"), and we both admire aspects of one another's personalities and try to learn from each other. \n\nI feel like I help him emote when he's overwhelmed and can't bring himself to despite needing it, and he helps me calm down when I'm too wound up. He teaches me to relax and have fun; I inspire him to work hard. The more I think about it, the more I realize that in many ways he is the exact opposite of me, but we both are completely magnetized to each other. Hell, we're in a two-year LDR (started in person, then I moved home) that spans over 8 time zones and is 5000+ miles apart, and I've never felt this right in a relationship before. 
3	Definitely the most magnetic relationship I had. Level of maturity and ability to communicate would've made it far more successful like any other relationship. But when our goals and interests were aligned, things never felt more right. Learned a lot about how to compromise. 
2	Help in figuring out type?	So I've thought I was an infp, enfp, entp, intp, and now I think I'm an enfj. I know functions. The problem is that I've been depressed for the last year and a half and for some reason or another I've had an easy time convincing myself I exhibit whatever function stack I thought I had. I've read that enfjs tend to look at the type of qualities they could have and use that to figure out who they are. That does seem like what I've done. I've successfully managed to "become" whatever type I thought I was to a greater or lesser extent. I started seeing a psychiatrist and I'm finally starting to figure out who I am again since I can feel things and feel them properly again. Part of me wants to forgo typing since it's seemed to do more harm than good, but I also know that figuring out my type proper will make it easier to become myself again. I seemed to have basically had a dart board of personality traits and to have just thrown darts at it randomly to see what sticks. I'm fairly certain I'm an extrovert, but I have a large amount of social anxiety on top of general anxiety, so it's hard to tell. I don't have very much control over when I'm able to be social, and even then it's hard to get comfortable enough to have fulfilling social interaction. When I am comfortable, I can talk with almost anyone and love it (I think). I seem to show a lot of Ni now that I'm healthy again. I can read into people very well and tell them why they do things or what they think better than they can themselves. I'm starting to have a more abstract thought process again (such as having a visual metaphor for how I think the onset of skitzophrenia would work), but (as far as I can tell so far) it's mainly used to explain things to people, rather than being so abstract I can't. I also have ADHD, which makes it hard to tell if I am a J, but I think my general thought process and the types of things that make me feel the most secure and content do seem to line up with J traits, whether or not I make those happen on my own. What questions would you have to help me figure this out?

7	ENFJ How do you define a boring conversation? As an INFP I can be quiet sometimes, specially in groups	The other day I was with a small group of people, and I’m usually the quiet one, but I just really enjoy listening to people and observing. Now I wonder if my ENFJ friends might find that boring. What do you think? 
8	Sorry, not an ENFJ (I'm ENTJ) and I'm not sure how helpful this will be to you, but still.\n\nNo one of my conversations are boring. I try find and prod something interesting about everyone, and if I can't I change the topic to something I am fascinated by and then try to connect with that person and pursue the conversation in the most promising direction.\n\nOf course there might be formal boring conversations (talking to supervisors at work etc.), but with friends just try to have a list of cool topics and bring them out and elaborate on the ones you like the most.\n\nINFPs should have TONS of things they love. Talk about them! If YOU CARE, you will MAKE YOUR FRIENDS CARE, if they're true friends. Just don't act like an asshole, of course and don't expect more of them than you give back etc.\n\nTry to imagine you care about the thing the other person is talking about (fantasy!) and find what that person is fascinated about - then you can live through that (fantasy!) and bring the conversation to those things you care about. :)
8	There's nothing wrong with listening, especially if you're attentive and make at least one insightful comment. The most boring conversations I have experienced are usually superficial or overly self indulgent.
5	Hey, ENFJ here\nA boring conversation to me is one without heart. Sorta like reading a news paper... "boy, it sure is a hot one today, don't you think" 😂 \nMaybe that is a bad example but being quiet isn't really being boring. To me, quiet people are usually mysterious and therefore the most interesting. \nAnother thing about ENFJs is our ability to pick up on vibes of the room and people. So if you're actively listening, chances are I'd feel like I am more entertaining you with conversation and thats not boring at all! \nHope my opinion helped!
6	I like to learn about people and have people learn about me, so a boring conversation to me is one that is one-sided — when I’m doing all the talking and the other person is not engaging, or when the other person is doing all the talking without checking in with me.\n\nAs for your scenario, you’re not saying much at all in a group setting, so I wouldn’t immediately think that that makes you a boring person. I’d probably just think of you as really quiet/ guarded/ maybe uninterested.
3	probably don't because enfj's like to share and INFPs like to listen.  I think it gets sorta boring if it's a one sided because a conversation requires two people to provide input.
3	No problem at all with people being quiet in a group, as long as you're friendly and make an effort to respond when people try to include you - just add a comment or ask a question once in a while so people will remember you're there!\n\nThe best conversations for me happen when I feel like I'm really getting to know someone and discussing genuine views. It's boring when people put on a show to try and make others like them (undeserved compliments, over-the-top enthusiasm, fake interest in others, etc).\n\nHope that helps!
1	I find a conversation boring when it's one-sided. When you're speaking to someone, expressing interest in what they're talking about, asking questions and they don't do the same. 
1	A boring conversation is when there is no interest in the conversation and the person keeps rambling on and you don’t know how to tell them to be quiet because you don’t want to offend them so you listen. I’ve had people ramble on about things and they couldn’t acknowledge I wasn’t interested in the topic and keep going whereas I if it were vice versa I would change the topic or stop talking. 
7	Friendship with the opposite sex.	So if you’re an enfj male and you have many girl friends that you ve really connected with..what doesnt make you fall for them? \nAnd if you’re in a commited relationship, do you expect your SO to be understanding of such thing? 
7	I am an ENFJ/ENFP male and I find connecting with girls way easier. Ive fallen for a few of them, and I've been at the very least attracted to just about all of them.\n\nI've relatively recently gotten into a committed relationship (it's been about a month), and I do not at all expect my SO to be understanding. She is understanding, but I don't expect her to be. The time I've spent with opposite gender people has fallen drastically since I started dating her. The reason is, any free time I have, I want to spend with her more than any other girl. She understands that, and knows that I am committed to her, so she's okay with me spending a bit of time with my female friends here and there. The trade off is that she gets to spend time with her male friends too. I'm okay with that as well, because I fully trust her. \n\nWhen she's free, I spend time with her. When she's not free, I spend time with other friends, most of which are female.  She's okay with it, but if at any point she tells me that she's not comfortable with it, I would stop, and she would stop too. I doubt that will happen, but every relationship is different. Gotta find what works for you. 
4	I'm a female ENFJ with a lot of male friends in a committed relationship. I can't speak for everyone, but I am very loyal to my partner and my interest in other men is not romantic, I just think they're cool people (same as women). \n\nWhen I was single I did sometimes develop little crushes or feel attraction towards friends, but since being in a serious relationship those kind of feelings barely enter my mind.
3	Connecting with people is easy regardless of gender for me as an ENFJ. I am not monogamous so it's not an issue with falling for multiple people which works well for me because I find it too difficult to limit my connections with people artificially.
4	There are a lot of factors.\n\n1) You have to place your relationship first. One way of thinking this is by picturing your relationship as a house with a fence around it. You have to make sure no one outside enters through your fence and tries to ruin your relationship. Think of each other as we, a unit, instead of as I.\n\n2) When you spend a lot of time with someone it is natural to develop feelings for that person, if there is mutual attraction. So if there is another woman whom you are friends with and who you are attracted to, it would probably be better to only spend time with them as friends once in a great while. Not every week. Also, it is better if your wife is there. Also watch how the other woman treats your wife. If she is rude to her, then that is unacceptable.\n\n3) Lastly but the most important, if you confide with your friend more than with your wife then that is a serious issue. When most people talk about infidelity they think of sexual infidelity, but there is also emotional infidelity. Like sneaking out to hang out with the other person. Or texting them constantly. Calling them constantly. And never ever ever talk about your relationship problems with the woman who may be attracted to you. That is a no no. She might take that as a cue to try to lure you away from her. She might start to think she would treat you better than your wife. So if you have any relationship problems take them with your spouse and not your girl friends.
1	Yeah I tend to make friends with girls more easily than with guys. My guy friends are very few and very close to me, and my girl friends are more numerous but for the most part, a little less close.\n\nMost of the time I do end up becoming attracted to them, but it's not a huge deal because I'm used to it and I just ignore it. I have stumbled into two relationships by not handling that attraction properly, and neither one went well, so I'm backing off all relationships for the next year or so, as I have this past year.
1	I always had more guys friends than girl friends but I had trouble telling guys I liked them when I had crushes. I’m sure when I do have a boyfriend knowing myself I would make sure I would date someone who would trust me. I hope to date someone who can hangout with my friends but I think that’s the idealistic side of me *_* 
3	ENFJ = uncertain of things?	I'm not sure if I am ENFJ, but I tested as that, so I'm going to roll with it. \n\nDo you feel like people/the world around you is too "certain" of things in general? Like how politicians are convinced of their ideologies etc. Sometimes I ask myself, "how can these guys be so sure?"\n\nI never feel like I am 100% certain of important things, and I change my mind fairly often. 
7	ENFJ here and yes. Yes to all. Never ever certain of some but not all important things. Cause I think of it from 1000 different angles and question everything I know. Leaving me 100% uncertain.
5	I am also uncertain of a lot of things. Open-minded might be an alternative term.\n\nWhile I have my own ideologies, I try to see things from other people's perspectives. Everything is relative. What may be good for one instance, may be bad for another moment.\n\nI think this is linked to our desire for harmony, to an extent that we give up our own ideologies to accomodate everyone else.
2	I can't really relate; I'm pretty certain about myself and I much prefer if others were certain about themselves.\n\nTests are inaccurate. Read up on cognitive functions of the types and decide where you stand — ENFJs have Fe Ni Se Ti. \n\nUncertainty due to an openness to change is more ENFP/ INFP.\n\nUncertainty due to slow cautiousness in decision-making is more INFJ.
1	Dose this include things like morality, or even your own existence?
7	INFP looking for eNFJ friends (or penpals!)	you guys are my favorite pls be my friend :P
4	hayyyyy!!!!! friends are always welcome. How are ya~!
4	Welcome! We're definitely a fun bunch 😋
3	I'd say you've come to the right place. 
3	Asking an ENFJ to be friends is like asking a puppy if it would like a treat and belly rubs. In other words...\n\nAbsolutely! Welcome! How has your day been?
2	Hi there! Though I am an ENFJ, I typically don’t socialize much. When I do, however, I think you’ll find that I’m a pretty neat guy that goes off the grid sporadically but is extremely philosophical in nature.
3	SUBREDDIT USER POLL: How should we deal with Discord Server invites?	We've had a lot of these, and they died down for a little bit while the "Low Effort Posts" sticky was up. Now we're seeing them come back. How should we deal with these? We mods don't want to make this call on our own. Here's a Strawpoll:\n\nhttp://www.strawpoll.me/14029773\n\nRight now, we're flairing them as "Advertisements" but otherwise not messing with them. I don't want to make any arguments either way, only the opinion of the sub at large. How do we feel about these posts?\n\nThanks!\n\nEDIT: gonna leave this up for another day and go with the results.
3	Do people actually want to use them, is the big question I think. I don't care if they're there, as long as someone actually finds them useful. Otherwise they're a waste of space, and I can find links on all the other mbti subs... fwiw
27	You guys are just the best kind of people.	I'm an INTP who's had quite a few ENFJs in my life and I just wanted you to know how much your reflexive kindness is appreciated by us nerds.
5	<3
1	Love nerds! You guys fascinate me!
1	Congrats, you fed our already overstimulated egos! Here's some upvotes! 
9	Feeling like you overwhelm people?	Hi, everyone! I just found this sub and that I am ENFJ. I find it insane how alike I am with other people. Anyway, let's get to the point.\n\nI have some very close friends (1 or 2) to whom I often tell very personal stuff and to whom I like to tell about my day and daily encounters in detail. I am not sure how common this is for ENFJ, but I see that there are other people that do it here. My problem is that these people often tell me how they aren't bothered, but I sometimes feel like I am overwhelming them with all the enthusiasm and sharing.\n\nDo you feel like this and how do you manage it?\n\nEdit: Actually I often feel like I overwhelm people overall.\n\nEdit2: The people that I unload to are usually from the more closed off, don't sweat it type (not sure what that is in MBTI terms) and it is a little weird when I am the only one sharing like that. They generally don't share their day like I do,  but say they are okay with it.
8	Find NFs to hang out with. (or just Fs)\n\nBe like "hey omg guys i found this cool online survey thing and i want you to take it and see what you are! and they'll secretly reveal fucking everything about themselves to you in just 4 letters."\n\nmagic.\n\n\n\n\nTLDR: CUT TO THE FEELING
5	I try and pay close attention to signs others are showing that they've heard enough. And not to completely dominate / spam the conversation. But mainly I meet up with other extroverts who don't mind me offloading as long as they get to do the same!
6	I feel like I just try to feel out how they're reacting to the situation. I know that if any of my close friends came to *me* with personal stuff, I'd have no issues giving them my time to see how I can help, or just listen to them get it out. \n\nI know that I can feel a bit uncertain about opening up to them like that, but I have to remind myself that these are my close friends for a reason and I know they'll be there for me the way I'm there for them. I still feel a bit awkward about it sometimes, but then I just remind myself that the awkwardness is really only in my own head, I overthink pretty much everything, so it's just something I'm always aware of. 
6	When I get really comfortable with certain people, I'm also sometimes guilty of offloading too much. Used to think "sharing is caring." But over time, I learned that other people may not be as ready or as inclined to share. In the past, that unspoken expectation negatively impacted my relationships with others. \n\nOlder and wiser now, I've learned to be more sensitive. While I still share liberally, I find it's paramount to show others that their words take priority too. Asking questions and remembering their answers usually gives them more incentive to share. The more conscious you are of the conversation, you are less likely to overwhelm the other person.
3	It's exactly the same with me. I like to ramble on about my day a lot because I get excited by all the little things that happened, and sometimes I worry that I'm overwhelming people or making them bored. Especially since my closest friends are introverted :P\n\nBut even though I share a lot about me, I listen to the other person too and when they start talking, I listen attentively, ask them questions and try to remember the details of what they said. 
2	Help me type: Is she an eNFJ or ESFP?	I gained a new friend. She's cute, fun to talk to, and surely an ExFx type. I've only consciously, certainly known one other ENFJ, and before I was sure she was an ENFJ, I thought she was an ExFP because of how bubbly she was. So now I'm stuck in a similar dilemma with this new girl. I'll list some of the things she does and ENFJs of reddit can perhaps type her.\n\n1. She's a lot less smiley than the first ENFJ I've met, even to the point where she seems introspective sometimes. However, she can get excited about things she likes. For example, showing her videos and pictures of cats can get her laughing and talking.\n\n2. During the first time I met her, she told me about how she communicates with friends. For example, she told me she isn't afraid of being a bit vulgar in humor. She also has enough confidence to not be easily embarrassed, whereas she's met certain people in life who were easily embarrassed and suffered from low self-esteem. She didn't criticize them, but I got the sense that she isn't like them therefore has a harder time getting along with them.\n\n3. She likes games that involve many people. She also likes parties and going out and drinking.\n\n4. Occasionally likes to talk about politics, although at a superficial level. \n\n5. I think she picks up on things that I like during our conversations. I used some memes of Einstein and she later on told me about how she's interested in astronomy. I also used some gifs of a Scottish fold cat and she later on mentioned a few things related to the breed. (Am I going crazy and seeing wrong patterns?)\n\n6. When she's unhappy, she makes a simple comment about it (like, "I'm sad today") and then expects people to ask/care for her. If the person listening doesn't ask why she's sad, she gets irrational and overwhelmed and blames the other person for making her feel worse. She noticed this behavior and realized its immature. \n\n7. She posts about cool things that happened during her day, relationship struggles and societal injustice on social media.\n\n8. Once stood for her beliefs in a group conversation by stating that helicopter parenting isn't a good way to help a child grow. Everyone's life-long partner should be their S.O. and not their parents. She wasn't forceful with it but nonetheless made a civil, polite disagreement.\n\n9. She leaves a lot of emojis while sometimes not being particularly expressive on her real face.\n\n10. She likes it when people enjoy her company. She also takes flattery really well and likes being seen in a positive light. I got her a nice dress and she got excited by the fact that her co-workers envied her. Image-conscious in general.\n\n11. Once chatted with a stranger easily. I think she can do this with any newcomer in her circle.\n\nThe first ENFJ I knew openly admitted that she loves people. She would thumbs-up as many Facebook pictures that included people smiling, people being happy, people getting married, and people cracking jokes, as she possibly can. She's extremely generous. And did I mention that she is really smiley, too?\n\nSo by comparison, this new ENFJ seems a bit...muted, if she's an ENFJ at all. I'm not gonna make her take a personality test, that takes away the fun. ;P\n\nFe-Ni or Se-Fi? Help a fella 'ere, ENFJs of reddit.
3	>I'm sad\n\n[Here's a picture/gif of a cat,](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4qd694yrK1qd477zo1_1280.jpg) hopefully it'll cheer you up :).\n___\n I am a bot. use !unsubscribetosadcat for me to ignore you.
2	I can't really tell; she could really be both!\n\nI identify with pretty much everything on there but to different degrees. I could see it all applying to my ESFP girlfriend too. I think it's really hard to type by the things she does. I type by disposition. \n\nENFJ females seem warm, bubbly, maternal, organised, but upon greater inspection, focussed, critical, dark, may need to ramble to organise thoughts and feelings.\n\nESFP females seem extremely chill towards life, Cool Girl (genuinely), very straight and to the point, bold but upon greater inspection, very introspective, articulates nuance in feelings in very straightforward manner.
9	INTP boyfriend trying to help ENFJ Girlfriend	So I found out that she's going through a rough time. She told me that she hates herself because what she wants to do conflicts with what will make others happy.\n\nI proposed that she change and unapologeticly be herself. She did it when she told her family that she was bi but for some reason she won't do it in this case.\n\nI know she wants comfort so I give her hugs but she wants other stuff. I can't tell her that things will be okay because I don't know that they will. \n\nShe said she's depressed and thinks about suicide(although she doesn't want to die because that would hurt people)but she doesn't believe in therapy and therapy would probably be too expensive anyway.\n\nShe knows what it would take to change the way she sees herself but it's too painful. She's changed before and she dislikes whatever she changes into.\n\nI've run out of ideas on how to help her. What do I do?
3	You can't help her if she doesn't want to be helped.  Recovering from depression is an extremely personal thing, and nobody can do it for you.  \n\nTherapy would help, so I would gently try to convince her to go.  There are ways to get therapy that won't cost you an arm and a leg.
2	What do you mean she doesn’t believe in therapy?
2	I've been in a similar position as your girlfriend. \n\nDepressed (for different reasons), self-defeating, didn't want to go for therapy.\n\nI think the difference is:\n\n* I wanted to get out of my depressed state and was determined to do so even if I lost all will for everything else\n\n* I knew it was my own battle to fight and I didn't want to place the burdens on my loved ones\n\n* Like always, I have action plans for everything I do and in this case, I went down the list of trying every single thing (except therapy) to improve my situation.\n\nHowever, my loved ones' support and love have been incredibly helpful. Like the other users said — you can't help who doesn't want to be helped. You can only do so much. Have you asked her what she wants?
2	Remind her that it's *impossible* to make everyone happy. You can try to find a middle ground to make as many people happy as possible, but at a certain point, she can't continue to make herself and her desires the lowest priority or she'll be unhappy for her entire life. \n\nApproach the situation not as changing who she is (because that's just too abrupt of a turn), but as *growing*, or evolving as a person. There's something to be said for always making others happy, but there has to be a middle ground and that seems to be something that she's got to take to heart.

7	Is this a miscommunication issue between ENFJ and INFP or an ENFJ trait?	Sometimes when I talk to ENFJs, I am completely confused, like they sometimes can make no sense to me. \nE.g. When they express an idea of doing something together, like an outing or activity. Saying things like: We should do a road trip, we should go try see that movie,etc. And at the end they don’t talk more about the idea or ended up doing the activity with other people, it’s confusing to me. Can you help me understand, please!\nAlso I want to know if the confusion is mutual, do ENFJs get confused when talking with an INFP? 
5	Not at all. I actually connect really well with all 3 INFPs I know.  You probably aren't reaching out to them enough or attempting to make plans with them.  If you don't understand them, it's most likely you aren't expressing your concerns and are just trying to assume what your friends intentions are.
5	This is just my input, but my best friend is an INFP and I am ENFJ. I talk about plans for the two of us all the time, but we only ever end up doing about 20% of them because I feel like I'm demanding too much of her alone time. This may be a factor!\n\nIf you're very keen to do the activities, I would give them a gentle nudge or indication that you want to do it. So if they've suggested a road trip, you could throw out some weekends you're free. 
4	I’m not an ENFJ, obviously, but I feel compelled to point out that they’re your complete opposite in the most conflicting way possible, in terms of cognitive functions. \n\nSo that would make a lot of sense. \n\nI have a close friend who is an ENFP, my conflictor. We really enjoy each other’s company, but deep communication has never been a relaxed and easy activity between us.
4	It might be slightly different styles of miscommunication! Being open and transparent is your best bet to make a solid plan with them. My boyfriend and my best friend are both INFP's and sometimes we communicate completely differently, but we're always there for each other which is nice. Just let them know how you feel.
3	ENFJ here, and only speaking from personal experience. \n\n>*First of all....You got to tell how you feel!*\n\nAs an ENFJ, and movies and stuff is normal everyday life, but there are special cases. The only silent indicator would be spending extra time alone despite those activities. I'm sure you will find out and it wouldn't be a big deal to just say so. ENFJs are pretty open, it's not like you will lose them...that simply doesn't happen. As an ENFJ...losing people is the [*worst*](https://www.reddit.com/r/enfj/comments/6syfia/enfj_advice_for_getting_over_a_lost_friend/); this is especially true when there is already mutual interests. Also, the xNFJ vs xNFP miscommunication can happen a lot in my personal experience; sometimes, an xNFJ and xNFP would just lost at the same time. That one conversation you could have would make this matter trivial, just make sure it's one-on-one. \n\nP.S. I know personally as an ENFJ, I do the same thing as the ENFJ in OP. Often times, I also have one person I really want to hang out with but never get a chance and it's often not being able to communicate well enough. It gets emotionally draining even which usually results in awkwardness.

5	Looking for tips as an infj mom raising an enfj son.	In general, I'm looking for other's experiences growing up. What were some things that you felt you really needed from your parents or teachers? What were your strengths and your struggles? How can I parent him the way he needs?
2	Suggest learning the Principles of Legitimacy. \n\n1) Your son must be able to speak up and be heard. It is essential that you let him explain himself and talk to you without you shutting him down. Enfj's hate confrontation and arguing and would rather avoid it at all costs, but if when trying to make a situation run smoothly and not get into a screaming match you don't let them talk and you don't listen, they will resent you.\n2) An expectation of continuation . The understanding that the rules/punishments will be the same today as they will be tomorrow. This means that doing x will result in the punishment y. If the punishment changes to something else overnight they wont trust you. That'll make a disconnect. Changing punishments and rules just because you're angrier that day or something will make them not trust you at all.\n3) The punishments and rules must be fair. If your son does bad thing x, he gets punishment y. If your daughter or someone else does bad thing x and gets an easier, not as harsh punishment then your ENFJ son will go insane. This also includes you, you must follow your own rules. If you say "No shoes in the house or else no tv for the week!" And you wear shoes inside and watch tv, that'll also make a disconnect. \n\nAlso an important thing is that ENFJ's do actually tend to be able to handle their problems themselves very well, just make sure they have an out on standby.\n\nPs: I'm not a parent, just an unprofessional teenager . If you have to ask for parenting advice on Reddit that's probably a bad thing. This may just all be biased on my personal experience, but oh well. Hope it helps!\n\nSource: the book David & Goliath by Malcolm Gladwell and also personal experience
2	Have you checked out descriptions on truity.com? It could be really helpful to give you some background info.
6	ENFJ guys, has anyone ever misunderstood your kindness as you courting them?	
12	This may not be the response you were expecting but...\n\nYes! I've had at least 4 experiences where the ladies proposition me. I was forced to come out as gay immediately. \n\nFor me, it's the combination of:\n- not having an agenda so I'm just usually relaxed and confident around women\n- some of them are cool and I befriend them, but they mistook that as me coming on to them (but me not asking them out, so I get asked out lol)\n- all four have said they felt an emotional connection because I "understood" them \n- I spray emotions. All the time. Especially when I'm drunk. I'm very affectionate and would say things like I love you to my friends. \n- It's not obvious I'm gay by the way I act\n- I'm highly educated, ambitious, fit, and maybe even a bit handsome. My mom thinks so anyway LMAO. \n\nI don't blame them 😜
6	Yes, one time there was this girl I liked, and we shared a lot of common interests, so it was loads of fun to talk to her, share stories, and whatnot. She was an artist too, and she’d come to me to ask for opinions, and always claimed I was the only person who’d give legitimate and constructive comments.\n\nOne day, she found out that I had a crush on her, and couldn’t bear to be friends because she assumed I was only being nice to her because I liked her.\n\nTo this day, that still hits me right in the feels. I’ve never felt so misunderstood in such a meaningless way. The idea that I came off as a “nice guy” just chills me right to the bone, and I feel absolutely terrible about it.
2	Yes... It's generally not *too* hard to get out of that position though.
1	It would be easier to count the friends who don't try to go to bed with me. 
5	What type of person gives you back as much as you give out?	So in other words, what are the characteristics of these people in your lives, and what effect do they have upon you? How do they make you feel? \n\nAnd what are you like with them? (Do you go into accepting-love-mode instead of usual give-mode, or is it different?)\n\nWe all know you guys expend much energy every day keeping us all feeling positive, accepted and motivated. Which type of person does that back for you?\n\nMany thanks 😊\n\n(Oh and if anyone is curious, there's no specific situation in my mind as I type this, no interpersonal problem with one of you guys, I just find myself pondering sometimes what/who gives to the giver and also I love my ENFJ friends to the bones and like understanding them). 
14	I don't think it matters for an ENFJ whether or not they receive the same amount back. In a way, we get something from giving. Any form of reciprocation, whether big or small, we would appreciate. \n\nBut I did think about it and the person I kept thinking about was my dad. Weirdly enough, he's ENFJ too. He gives so much for me to get what I want. He wants nothing in return but for me to enjoy my life. I don't know what I did to deserve him.

4	agreed with colormehue  \nthere are multiple factors, the main ones are your own expectations.  \nnobody controls your expectations than yourself. you might want X and consider it the same as Y, but its not )   \nplus it depends on your philosophy, and how much you autovalidate for certain actions  
4	Thank you for this post <3 I'm INFJ and my ENFJ boyfriend did so many wonderful things for me this birthday. His birthday is around the corner and I'm in a financial rut right now :( so although I wish I could do so much for him, I can't financially :( I mean, luckily I got a credit card that allowed me to purchase him some nice gifts but I'm sort of embarrassed to be like hey, let's go out to dinner *takes out credit card :( like what a loser :( so it's nice to read you guys appreciate any kind of reciprocation.
3	Hello! Thanks for the post! (I'm an ENFJ)\nWith my friends and people around me, I usually try to help them out as much as I can. I don't really expect anyone to "give back"; honestly I just get a lot of satisfaction just seeing that I can make someone else happier. \nBut it does make me much happier when people express some form of thanks for what I do. \nA friend of mine (who I think is an INFJ) gives back a lot to me. He is a great support system for me. :3 
3	Not very many people do.\n\nIt's hard to accept.\n\nBut basically you end up having to do it for yourself.\n\nAnd the thing is -\n\nYou're REALLY GOOD AT IT.\n\nYou're amazing at taking care of other people, at accepting and loving and making others feel positively and feel okay. You can do it to *everyone*. It's magical.\n\nSo basically. You have to learn to do it for yourself.\n\nFirst step is...\n\nstarting to believe that you can actually do it for yourself\n\nhere's a song someone sent me recently that helped:https://genius.com/Isbells-dreamer-lyrics
5	Feelings of jadedness and animosity?	Haven't been on r/enfj in a while, but thought ya'll could give an ENFJ some context.  Just got reduced to friend status while attempting to build a relationship with another ENFJ.\n\nShe just came out of a relationship, I was looking for one.  The timelines didn't match up.  We spent a lot of time together, we were intimate, all those signs that something was going to come of it.  I admit now that my objective self would have said this was going to end this way; the fact we had conversations that we were in two different places, things of that nature.  I still went along for the ride.  \n\nNow I'm trying to sort out how I feel and what I think of it all.  I tend to lean on the jaded side when these things happen to me.  My friends get very defensive in these situations when they see me get burned, but I don't want them to "pick my side".  I want things to be as normal as possible, even though I know things wont be completely normal.\n\nI don't want to be jaded or feel animosity towards her.  I feel the need to get over my feelings of her by moving on.  I feel immature for asking this but, how do you move on without being jaded/having that animosity?  
5	I separate out my own grief and disappointment from the person, and allow both to 'be'. It's an acceptance that it's ok for me to feel this way, and that it will be a process before I'm feeling great again, and that by accepting that I'm allowed to grieve, I stop having to assign blame to myself or the other person, and the feelings don't have to be suppressed either.  If I try not to feel the negative feelings, I have this suppression thing going on and the resentment from that leaks out somehow because the emotions aren't dealt with. \n\nIt's ok for you to feel disappointed, who wouldn't? It's ok for her to still need to be single for a while, who wouldn't? It's ok for two adults to have conflicting needs and for that to hurt a bit (or a lot). \n\nWriting the thoughts out or verbally processing with a trusted friend until it starts to hurt less are useful. And these processes actually help your amygdala/emotion centre process the emotional 'trauma' and store it as long term memory rather than the recurrent, unprocessed acute memories you feel when still hurt about something. \n\nJust my perspective as a perceiver. 
3	By being an adult and not feeling entitled to anyone's love. By working and focussing on yourself and therefore truly moving on.\n\nYou both made it clear that a relationship is not on the menu. This is nobody's fault.
1	It helps to have space from that person so then you let your negative feelings settle first before interacting with them.  The feeling of rejection can be pretty heavy, but you have to have that level of respect for that person and their feelings.  You can't force love and if the feelings aren't mutual, it helps to stay away from the nice guy mentality.  \n\nI personally like to imagine that this is just saving you the trouble of getting into a relationship, only to find out you guys aren't compatible.  It skips over all the mess that could have happened if you guys did try to pursue said relationship, especially since the other party does not feel compatible with you in the beginning.  We all want to find that special someone, but that's not the most difficult part of the process.  The difficult part isn't finding someone, but the work it takes in maintaining the relationship.
3	Do many of you struggle with identity? (Need help, long post)	Do many of you struggle with identity? 3 nights ago, I was convinced that I was an ESTJ, I'm beginning to think I may be an ENFJ (I don't have enough data to confirm this), I have never bothered with identity, nor was I troubled with emotions. I was raised by a Borderline ENFP parent who says I was the best kid ever, never troubled, always kind, obedient (I remember being lauded for this several times, at home.), went to boarding school from 6th to 8th grade, and always tried real hard to make friends, not for personal reasons but just because I wanted them. I just wanted to give and take, that's all. Was always out of place, so I never really made any, and my dad always got transferred around, plus boarding school, so my oldest friend was probably made at 15.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe first time, I tested as ENFP, and thought I was one, strongly, to the point that I would identify with it, and try to use that to explain "who I was", something I always "felt" the need to, but there never was, which I know now. While explaining the "no friends" part, I realized that I was always fighting against identity, like I didn't want it, "the ENFP", my brain said, but I think I know why, my mom assumed a lot of things about me when I was younger, "gave" me things and said "I liked them", said "this" was what you liked, you are "this", and never could understand me, truly. At one point, when she tested as an ENFJ the first time, I thought she was an unhealthy ENFJ, but after observing her a bit more, I began to think she probably always was an ENFP, though this made me pause and wonder if she really was an ENFJ all this time, I suspect she could be, but she is too unpredictable to make a sound judgment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI dragged the mom identification part out a bit, as I am still unclear as to who she is, but I felt like it was relevant, though I couldn't quite put my finger on it. She could be either, because I just thought at the beginning of this post, that a friend of mine, who's an "ENFP" could be an ENFJ because she is very similar to my mom in never giving up on her friends, but this is just too darned not right to make a sound judgment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs for me, I "finally" managed to "get away" from home, after spending years trying to get my mom and dad together so we could live a "normal" life, as is the case in my country (India), I did ask them to get a divorce, when younger, but they couldn't go through it for "social reasons", and my "little brother". I think I need to revisit my "ENFP" friend, later. But yes, I spent the next 3 years in "paradise", I got to be around people who were "family" oriented, called me "big brother", felt amazing in a family-oriented and "social" society where "everyone" partied! It was amazing, I let loose, did not care for the world, was IN the moment. Made bucketloads of friends, who I still miss, was respected and loved everywhere I went, and then I began to feel the pull, for intimacy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn my country, everyone get "married" at 25-28 or more in some cases, and I was 23 when I came to this city, if you are "of age", you will get married. Parents will find you a suitable "spouse", and this is who you marry, unless the person you "love" is of a "suitable" community. This meant there was always a fear looming that the girl I liked could get "married" to someone, and the entire "dating" scene was almost non existent, with it either happening "away from the parents" or women playing it safe, or men "demanding" it, and traumatizing women, who would not want to get into "another" relationship, and "just" marry.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis meant that though I loved the city, and had everyone there, I felt like I couldn't "marry" there, and this led me to choose to "leave" the city, I could "physically" feel my body disconnect, like roots were being pulled out of the ground, and I left, having convinced myself before I did, that I wasn't meant for this place. And I was an "ENFP" who "needed" more "freedom", and I "need" family because it is a "physical", "existential" need.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo I quit my job, in all this time, I was not communicating regularly with family at all, especially with mom, told my dad I had quit my job when I had a month left to return, came back home, couldn't "find" "direction", fixed my family finally, and then realized I couldn't go anywhere. Tried to "connect" with extended family, and realized they were too far gone, they "loved" me, all of them, but I realized I couldn't be "intimate" with them, they were too far away. Tried online "direction" courses from Lynda, read a bunch of articles on TinyBuddha, "discovered" astrology, tried to read my chart, by myself, amazed and confused myself more. Was messaged by my friend from the city I was in, instantly felt energized and decided it was a "sign" I had to return, returned, couldn't get myself into a job, didn't have the motivation to work for it. Tried to "identify" myself again, kept going with the Astrology (feel the strain in my body to this moment from all the "connection"), convinced myself I was an INFP (and that's why I couldn't put a finger on my feelings), joined a group, tried to get Astrological "data" so I could be sure if I could "trust" it. Found an INFP, was the best thing that ever happened to me, we were on the same boat, so we confused each other initially, it was too good, was "convinced" that she was the one, left home for claiming "I'd found the one", was a disaster after, home was so different, and she was "unempathetic" and oft "judgmental" of my circumstance, got on my nerves, and we ended it badly.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLeft for the city, again, was much worse, returned with a broken TV, and more lost than ever. Got too serious with Astrology, ruined my perception, and been regaining it massively in the past few days.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDo I sound like an ENFJ? Did I behave like one? I don't know what "I" want, I almost always know what "everyone" wants, I always was haunted by "but I can't get this, because", and I was always the "good" guy. It felt like the right thing to do, and I never could put myself, first. I never wanted to, never felt bad about not. Until I broke down one day in between, while in that "city", telling myself, ENOUGH no more nice guy, BE A MAN. And that was the beginning. I feel like it all started from there, but I am beginning to realize I probably have always been an ENFJ, not a less-opportuned ENFP like I used to think I was. I never connected with any of the typical "behaviours" of the ENFP. I never paid attention to "ENFJ", but do I sound like one? Have I behaved like one? Because I don't know what I want, never did, and it doesn't "change" all the time, I just look for deeper meaning, and social appropriateness, while trying to figure out the best thing for everyone. Just been learning to stand up for myself, but I'm realizing I maybe took it too far? I don't have enough data for anything, I just "know" stuff, but those who "talk" these have always "known" me as an ENFP, and I refuse to discuss "personal" stuff with anyone I am not comfortable with, especially those who "help" me because they "want" to, like that online friend, my mom, and the other offline MBTI knowledged friend I had.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat do you think? I'm sorry if my content was confusing, I don't know what to edit, please ask anything, and I will reply as soon as possible.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEdit - I'm 27. I used to be verbal, not anymore I think (this information just popped up). Also, Enneagram 26(not sure if)9.
4	i'm not sure why it's so important to you to find out what your mbti is. this is more of a fun thing to think about as opposed to the fiber of your very being.  Although it sounds like you want to work on yourself using mbti and so want to be properly typed.  Most people would answer that you need to take a look at cognitive functions to see what you think you relate with the most.
10	My ENFJ friend considers himself a "loser". How do you guys personally define loser? Common social measures of success: Education, Money... he doesn't care about those things but hurts that he doesn't have them anyway	I think this could be viewed as an Fe issue in some ways. \n\n\nHe is the most caring and most creative person I know (although he has not been able to make a career from his creativity yet, and recently turned 31).\n\nAnyway, how do you personally define "loser"? He isn't as loser and I want to help him stop feeling that way.\n\nOne of my goals is to help him redefine "loser".\n\n\n\n\nAny help would be very appreciated. He is extremely depressed and I'm not sure how to help.\n\n
12	In some cases, ENFJs find it easier to take anger or disappointment out on themselves instead of others. It’s likely that your friend had a bad experience (getting rejected, failing a test, losing a job) that plagues their mind. To not annoy others, they’ll tend to avoid it in conversation, saying, “I’m a loser”, ambiguously, as opposed to, “I’m a loser cuz I lost my job/got rejected/failed that test”, although this obviously isn’t 100% of all cases.\n\nThe first step is finding out the direct reason(s) that they are upset with themselves. From there, you just have to egg them on, “you’re the smartest person I know/you didn’t deserve to be fired/you’re a very attractive male/female”. They’ll deny it every time, so don’t do it too often, or else you’ll lose their trust. Instead, find creative and conclusive ways to prove these things to them.
5	I think the difficult part is that everybody, regardless of type, has different values they hold dear. Being an ENFJ simply means that those values tend to be passionately informed by feeling and intuition. What happens is that we end up being really good at things like caring, helping, empathy, charisma, openness, understanding, etc., but often those may not be our values. Values tend to form their foundations when we learn about their importance from our family, and ENFJs are great at feeling what is important to others (often more than what is important to themselves). So, as in my case, you may end up with these sort of side values you never chose, but that were always pushed on you as a kid and thus feel like an expectation (efficiency, logic, competence, achievement, duty, order). And if those values don't match your natural abilities, research says you will have a lower self-esteem. \n\nSo the goal is to help him identify what matters to him, what those values are, and in doing that he may need to let go of some that are simply being used to beat himself up. Putting more stock in the ones that can give something back to him (for me they are joy, kindness, openness, creativity, etc.). Acceptance of the value of his natural abilities. And if he can't let them go, finding more things he can do that will help him feel like he is living in line with them (if accomplishment is one, what helps him feel accomplished? How does he know when he has accomplished something?). But all that is easier done in therapy than friendships. 
2	Just invite them (or make sure someone invites them) to take the lead on some project. That should solve it ;)
10	How good are you at "letting go"?	Found out I'm an ENFJ type personality not long ago, when someone I was casually dating asked me about it. Recently, things ended somewhat abruptly between us due to personal differences. We've made our peace since then, but reading other Reddit threads has helped me understand what went wrong.\n\nEven though it seems like we're about 95% through, it's that 5% that keeps me up occasionally. Times like these make me wish I didn't care about other people's feelings as much.\n\nI think I've always had a hard time getting over things emotionally, but can talk myself out of a funk with some cold logic. I'm disposed to feeling emotional, but rarely lose my composure. Journaling helps, but I have a hard time sharing deeper thoughts and feelings with others. Even with my closest friends and family.\n\nWhat's it like for the rest of you? What do you do when a relationship (romantic or platonic) goes sour? And how good do you think you are at letting go of it?
12	I also have my own share of letting go problems. I try to convince myself with logic too but letting myself feel the sadness (or other feelings) is what helped me in the end. Talking to friends about it is also really helpful for me. Verbalizing it allows me to really think about the situation. 
3	I'm not sure if this is relevant for your situation but I would previously look to intensify my feelings if I missed someone by just getting caught up in thought cycles about all the good times we shared. What's helped is just making a conscious effort to spend less and less time on this. And therapy for some deeper attachment issues for me. 
3	You are not alone. I also have difficulties letting go, especially if an element of betrayal or deceit is involved. For amicable partings, though, because of work or distance, it comes easy.
3	What I usually do is I distance myself on everything that's happening to me and try to divert my attention say at work or other relationships (family or friends). Usually I shrug off things that's happening like if I miss a bus, it's alright, I missed the bus, moved on. I don't let myself fixate on one thing because I've noticed it making things worse
2	If you can go see a therapist, even if you do t need to, you can learn coping skills and other skills to help you manage difficult situations. Enfj part helps let go because I always see a bright side to everything so nothing gets me down for long, onward and upward. The therapy skills are just ways to learn and grow as a person and very helpful.
2	I find that I can say I've let something (or someone) go, but occasionally thoughts about it/them pop up and I get sad about it. However, I don't hold grudges. I usually end up blaming myself for what happened. \nIf a relationship goes sour, I try to maintain some form of friendly contact with that person and I try to hide my disappointment or anger from them and just let them live the way they want to. \nWhen I'm trying to let go of something, talking it out helps a lot. 
2	I'm not sure if I am ENFJ, but I SUCK at letting go. It is painful... any kind of break up, ending relationships, forgetting someone etc. is painful to me. I tend to avoid it 100%.

6	How are you at making REAL friends?	Kind of an intimidating question, but..\n\nYou know what I mean! The type of friend who knows what music you like, your secrets. Whom you can share anything with and will be there for you to talk in moments of distress.\n\nI'm just asking because I've been having such problems lately (lol), connecting with new ppl. Even if we chat, or give one another a hint of interest, I end up feeling like my "niceness" or "friendliness" is taken advantage of. Maybe because they have no one else to talk to so they talk to me or the fact that no one else will give them their class notes (currently in uni btw).\n\nDo any of you guys feel this way? Or have at some point? Maybe I'm just blowing this out of proportion! IDK! What do you think?\n\n(I HAVE FRIENDS, I JUST LIKE MAKING NEW ONES)
12	It sounds like you're overthinking the situation. Have these people done anything to make you think that they're only talking to you because they want something from you?\n\nI don't have much trouble talking to someone because I tend to talk to everyone as if they're already my friend. Yes, I used to think that people only talked to me out of pity because there was no one else interesting enough in the room. But those thoughts were mostly due to my own low self-confidence. My advice to you would be to stop over-analysing the situation, and just talk to these people without fixating on an ulterior motive (gaining them as a friend). Listen as much as you talk, ask them about themselves (because people love talking about themselves) and genuinely be interested in what they say. Oh! And don't be afraid to ask them to hang out with you outside of class :) \n\nAt the end of the day, some people can be assholes who ARE only talking to you for your class notes, or some people simply might not like you, and that's okay! There are plenty of people out there who will like you for who you are and enjoy your company.
6	This sounds familiar. Definitely had thoughts like these when I first attended college. I was generally friendly and well-liked, but sometimes felt like I was always the second choice for a best buddy. To compensate, I tried to be nicer - more giving. A little part of me must've wanted some kind of acknowledgment for the gesture.\n\nWhat I learned is that sometimes, we give away too much without considering how much others are willing to reciprocate. Here're my two cents - take 'em or leave 'em. Try not to expect a certain amount of good will in return. And try not to measure others in terms of what they give back. Some really great, lasting friendships will find you eventually.

1	I think someone took advantage of you(maybe more), and you're still hurting, you're still looking for that one person you can trust with whom you can share everything, and not be taken advantage of, and then everything will be alright... shh...\n\nYes, it was terrible, loner-izing, and I lost everyone to the point that when I came back, they felt like I couldn't connect with them, anymore, everyone had just moved on with their lives (like they do!).\n\nMaybe this is just me, partly, but I know we meet somewhere, partly. I feel like it's my 8 (enneagram) standing up, not letting my 2 function to the point that my post probably isn't as empathetic as I'd like. (sorry), but I just want you to know that you're not alone, and that it sucks (possibly), and if you connected with any part of what I said, that you will get better, and it will get okay, just remember who you are, and be true to yourself, and keep working until things get better!\n\nPlus listen to the wiser advices here, I suck at giving them, right now, lol\n\nPeace! <3\n\nAlso, WHY DO I HAVE TO WAIT 25 SECONDS TO COMMENT? xO
1	I have the same issue. It's okay to say no and give yourself your own time. Keep yourself healthy that way so you don't get taken advantage of. Those real friend will come along and won't take advantage of you.
5	INTP with a question...	Hi, all you lovely ENFJS, so I need to ask something, for science and for my own peace of mind. \n\nI've read a lot of things about INTP and ENFJ being great matches. Now, a couple of years ago, I crushed pretty hard on a confidante/teacher and ever since my interest in MBTI, I'm desperate to know which personality type she is. My gut feeling tells me she's an ENFJ, but she may also be an ENFP. \n\nSome of the following info, I'm privy too, both cause of our interactions( We were somewhere straddling the edge of acquaintance/friends and never really had a teacher-student dynamic.) and because she used to be friends with my sister in highschool.\n\nThis woman is:\n\n cheerful,  fun-loving, easy-going, empathic, enthused about the tiniest things, funny in unexpected ways(it's either in the delivery or in randomness), very sensitive( prone to crying), not shy in giving out compliments, supportive, protective, a little insecure and prone to self-doubt, innocent( just this vibe), warm and just very comfortable to be around, a great listener, curious about how things are done, energetic, idealistic, bit naïve, nurturing, spontaneous, imaginative, ethical(against drugs, stealing etc..), laid-back, slightly organized(made study-timetables in highschool) and doesn't really enjoy being the center of all attention.\n\nSo, does anyone here maybe recognize themselves in this description, or is this more ENFP-leaning? I know my info may not be much to go on, but I really don't click with a lot of types, so typing the one person I ever fell for, might just be very useful in helping me find another kindred spirit. Please send help...\n\n
3	Definitely ENFJ! \n\nNope nope. A little ENFP. Maybe even INFJ (that ethical part? Yah.)\n\nI'm sorry my bro. I think you fell for a person, not a type. Im pretty sure you'd meet a lot of ENFJs you'd get on, as well as ENFPs, and INFJs. And loads you won't. \n\nI'll let someone else guess at what type the object of your affection is. I know you posted this because you're curious, and reading about the type makes you feel maybe a little closer to her. And that's okay, absolutely. Maybe i just assumed too much. I dunno. \n\nI just don't want you thinking you'd get on one type over another. You like the person and that's that. I fucking hate INTJs but look at me, dating one. I am irked at ENTJs but my sister is one and she's so amazing. Not because he's INTJ or she's ENTJ. It's because we just gel. \n\nWere you thinking of pursuing something more, and that's why you wanted to know the type? Or did you want to know how to ask her out? Or are you just curious....? Because you know...you can ask her to do the MBTI too. Might be better than silently obsessing. \n\nSorry if I came a little on left field and hard on you. 
2	I've found the difference between J and P is demonstrated well in the person's preference for planning. \n\nSo, you said she's laid back, but put together a study schedule for the week? Sounds like a J. J's don't even have to *know* what they plan to do as long as they feel some control.\n\nFor instance, this Friday evening I am planning to "go out" and do something on the town. No idea what, but I know my wife needs to get out and do things often, so I plan it for her. \n\nOn the other hand, a P will truly "go with the flow" to the point of some J's frustration. P's often take 3x as long to choose something at a restaurant and even then they'll change their order. P's act on things as they happen; hence the word "perceive". \n\nSource: an official MBTI workshop I was a part of.
2	Another INTP (this is an illegal squat) in a similar situation in the past (still don't know), but you should look for signs of the functions instead of behaviours.\n\nThe ENFJ's are : Fe Ni Se Ti. (Versus Ne Fi Te Si for the ENFP)\n\nShould help to be sure if she's ENFJ or ENFP,  at least, especially the Fi vs Fe divide. Only way to be sure is for her to do the work, though : \n\nTaking the test, reading the descriptions, learning the functions, and to doubt a lot, lol.\n\nAlso, knowing her type won't help that much at your stage. Go for it, then worry about mbti.\n
3	I'm an ENFJ woman who had crush to an INTJ guy...How will i know if he likes me too?	Where friends...almost a year...\nHe tease me a lot..and really likes to annoy me..\nLast time i ask my other friend(a girl) who sits besides him to give me a letter...coz that girl is my bestfriend..then he says to my crush(INTJ) that give me a letter rather that her who i ask to write for me.\n\nMy crush wrote, I DONT CARE WHAT TOU FEEL ❤.\n\n\n
7	Your title makes sense but the description does not so I'm unsure how to proceed/what to write :/
2	Tell him you're attracted to him and ask if he feels the same. The flirting/beating around the bush habits of ENFJs become a waste of time. Just friggen ask. 
9	Hello ENFJ-s. What does our low Ti mean? How can we improve that?	
8	It's important to think about where cognitive functions lie and what role they fit in. It's not just that we are bad at thinking functions, there is more to the story. Ti fits into our aspirational slot, so it means we grapple with being inferior in that area and feeling that we *should* be better at it. That we *should* utilize it more. That doesn't mean ENFJs can't compensate and learn ways to analyze and theorize based on data, but it does mean that those efforts to compensate outside our default abilities tend to be motivated by feelings that we should be more logical overall. \n\nAs for Te, because it is our last function it tends to cut us off from our core, what really matters to us (our feeling and intuition), which is why it tends to be so destructive. When we are doing the most harm to ourselves and others, we are typically coming from a "logical" emotion-separated problem-solving (often manipulative) place. \n\nWith both, understanding yourself more helps lead to understanding how to defuse the roles those functions serve. It's also important to note that functions are exacerbated with stress, so an ENFJ may have learned to use Ti fairly adequately, but that may go out the window with stress. 
8	"Gentle" vs "Tough" ENFJs	Hello ENFJs, I have a question.  Do you think of yourself as a gentle or a tough person, and why?\n\nI ask this because I have a funny experience as an INFJ of hearing mixed opinions *about* INFJs from other people.  I've heard that INFJs are somehow soft, gentle, kind, and withdrawn, while also being the colder, more pragmatic, goal-oriented feeler.  Have you experienced this strange dichotomous reputation?\n
15	Relatable. It's velvet gloves, iron fists. \n\nExample: I'm usually kind and warm when I'm listening and comforting you on your first break up with your ex. \n\nBy the 5th breakup with the same ex, I will pretty much hand you your ass back and you'd swear I was an ENTJ in full super Saiyan boss mode.  
9	I think that we can be both, given the context. Very logically driven, to the point where we can accidentally come off as cold, but also emotionally impassioned enough to get our feelings really hurt. Sometimes over things others would shake off.  \n\nOr maybe I just have issues. 
3	I'm not gentle, and I'm not tough, either. I can look tough on the internet if I am pissed off enough, but I am not consistently tough IRL.\n\nI think I care a lot about people in general, and at the same time, say a lot of things that hurt them. I can be terrible. I can say the most awful things, etc. But there is generally an emotional reason when I do that. \n\nSometimes I can be very diplomatic tho. Like, nobody is more diplomatic than me when I feel like I have to act diplomatically.
1	I can relate!
2	How would you describe you experiences with ENTJ-s?	
6	My sister is an ENTJ and i absolutely respect and admire the sheer force of her willpower. If I can think of a person with grit--the one who will persist through the most challenging of times--it will be her. She's been a source of my personal strength since our early adulthood. \n\nThat said, she can be extremely stubborn and calcified when she's decided on something. Her persistence and trust in her vision will see that bridges will burn because they light the way, and people's feelings will be steamrolled to hell or high water. I wouldn't follow her on this approach. \n\nBut she gets shit done. What she says she wants, she gets. I may be a tad poetic, but if a full blown INTJ is an immovable object, ENTJs are the unstoppable force. 
3	My partner of 2 years is an ENTJ! I myself am ENFJ. I love how driven and talented he is! If he wants to be good at something he'll just do it until he outclasses everyone. It's really inspiring - he appreciates my encouragement and I love watching him shine. \n\nWhen things don't go his way though, he is very hard to cheer up, which I hate lol. I know it's silly and impossible but I want him to be happy all the time so I have a hard time dealing with when he's in a bad mood and I can't fix it with talking, hugs and kisses. 
1	ENTJs are monster versions of us, I love them and are scared of them at the same time.  We don't make the same decisions because we value different things.  I think if we can "shut off" our feelings, we're pretty much ENTJs!
5	help for a compliment to give a friend as they walk past me to class in 2 days	this person is awesome and I want an awesome way to say that.\n\nrelationship: I'm m(intj) she's f(enf) ((10th grade))\n\nI've gotten closer as a friend but no romance pls(not looking for it). \n\n\n\ngive me your best ideas/compliments :D\n\nalso, how should I say it without being awkward, like should I slow down as she passes by and ask her to wait or something. don't want to mutter it and run away !\n\n
3	"Hey _____, you're awesome! I'm really glad we're friends!"\n\nI dunno, why make it complicated? If you don't want it romantic then just keep it simple :)\n\nWhy do you want to compliment her? What inspires you to say something to her specifically? Coz that's what she'll most want to hear.\n\nI'm most flattered when people notice my character, because it tells me that they know me. It seems more genuine and tailored.\n\nMaybe you could even write a note to give her so she has time to read and process?
2	Compliment something about her outfit. 
1	So what happened? It's been two days. I need closure. 
1	why do you have to do it as she walks past you to class?? can't you just ask her out for a meal or something & let the compliment come naturally / organically? like i honestly think it's cute that you seem shy about it – but giving someone a compliment shouldn't be rehearsed or seem this daunting / pressurising! :)\n\nanyway you could always write her a note if all else fails :p updates please 
1	Do you talk to her often? If so, when you see her in the hallway, say hi, tag along, and start talking to her. \nPotential scenarios: \n-You could ask her what class she's going to. She says: 'Oh, I'm going to _________(e.g. physics)" and you could say "Whoa! That's a hard course! You must be really smart/good at science/etc.!" \n-While talking to her, you could compliment her on her outfit. \n-Ask for help with something. Then say: "Wow! Thanks for being so helpful!" or something like that. \nThose are just some ideas. 
9	Having unrealistically high standards?	Hello there, I'm an INTP and my girlfriend is an ENFJ. Wondering if you all could give me some context from her perspective.\n\nI feel like my girlfriend has ridiculously high standards for people - including herself, and in practice that means she pushes people away sometimes. She will do favors for others, or put others before herself every single time, even when nobody asks for a favor. And then when they don't do the same for her, she gets upset.\n\nFor example, living with housemates: let's say the living room needs to be cleaned and nobody else is pulling their weight. She will always have the mentality of "if no one else will do it, I have to." So she spends hours cleaning on a regular basis. Later, in an argument where someone doesn't want to help her out, she brings this up in protest - "but I spend hours every single week cleaning up after *you!*" to which the person might be like "Okay, I never wanted or asked for that, so why are you acting like I owe you something?" She's sensitive too and will get her feelings hurt in these arguments, then resort to name-calling. Like, because the other person hurt her (even if unintentionally) she must now hurt them intentionally.\n\nAnother example is lying. Everyone lies at some point, people lie for so many reasons whether its to make themselves feel good, others feel good, etc. Now I hate people who lie all the time for no reason, but if *anybody* **ever** lies to my GF and she realizes it, she will call them out and *never* let it slide. But it's not just lying; any behavior she finds unacceptable or that she wouldn't do, she calls out. I think this makes people feel like they have to act a very certain way or adhere to some unknown moral standard she sets, and they're scared of breaking it.\n\nDon't know if this is making sense, but a lot of people interact with her like a mother or something. When times are tough, they will vent their feelings to her. Absolute word vomit, sharing all their personal details and leaning on her for emotional support. But then when times are good, they don't want to call her and hang out like a genuine friend would. This makes me angry because I don't want to see her used like that, and I feel like it's linked to them seeing her not as an equal but as an authority figure almost.\n\nCan you all give me any tips for where she's coming from on this? I know INTPs can be insensitive, and generally speaking we complement each other well. She has helped me tune into my emotions 100x what they used to be, but sometimes the way she sees social interactions or behavior seems irrational to me.
7	Yup. That's pretty much accurate. I definitely do the cleaning/taking care of everything. I realize now it's in the hopes that others will support me in the same way, to my high standards. It's borderline manipulative, though she may not recognize that. She feels like she's being a helpful teammate that will be viewed favorably. But eventually resentment builds up because it's really passive behavior. It would be better to say "hey I cleaned up the living room today, it was looking pretty rough, could you please do it next time." (or not do it at all, which takes enormous willpower). I get the same with people over-sharing then ghosting. I do my best to be a good friend, but it's not reciprocated. It's very hurtful and lonely. It's a constant battle of being a good teammate, sensitive to other's feelings, and having high standards for ourselves. It's exhausting. It will result in a miserable life for her if she doesn't learn to moderate all that 'giving' and learn to be in touch with her needs. (my 2 cents)
6	As a male ENFJ I can definitely identify with this.  I have a very strict moral code that I live by and I sometimes project it onto or others or expect them to adhere to my "rules."  I go out of my way to help other people, often leaving my own needs neglected.  Lately I've been trying to practice saying no to people, because I need to sometimes to preserve and maintain my sanity.
4	Woah \nYour gf sounds just like me. \nI take "treat others the way you want to be treated" very seriously. If I help you out with something, I expect the favor to be returned or be appreciated. \n\nMy memory sucks when it comes to names and faces BUT when it comes to ppl and their behaviors and what they tell me, I remember everything! If I catch someone in a lie, I call them out lol. If I notice they are acting strange or different, I call them out. I'm also very blunt and say things without thinking. \n\nHonestly, I should just be a detective 🙄\n
3	I can relate to your girlfriend and have most of her behaviours too. Try to have a friendly discussion with her about your types like "hey isn't this interesting we're different types? What do you think about this? Do you agree with your type" \n\nHopefully this will encourage both of you to do the reflection together instead of relying on assumptions. For me even though I knew my standards were unrealistic sometimes I never felt that I could open up and talk to someone because it felt like no one else understood or cared to ask why I am the way I am, which made me defensive or argumentative when my behaviours were being discussed. Good luck!  
1	I don't identify with this...\n\nI hate cleaning and you'd never see me doing it every week hahaha! I live in an organised mess. If I do clean, it's to impress others, or receive thank yous. Otherwise idgaf.\n\nI set very high standards for myself that I get upset about when I don't meet, however I'm much more tolerant of other people. I understand that you can't change behaviour straight away and it's something to work on. In that regard, I wouldn't get angry at others, unless they were doing something against me. In regards to house chores, I'd be more likely to have a house meeting and discuss it if it really bothered me. I'd motivate everyone to work together for the betterment of the household. Elsewise I just let it go. \n\nI dislike lying, but I am highly unlikely to call people out on behaviour if I don't have to, because I'd rather avoid the conflict. Putting up with it or avoiding/ignoring is more manageable for me than bringing it up. Attacking ppl solves nothing and gives me heaps of anxiety. I also feel like it deteriorates friendships.\n\n>...adhere to some unknown moral standard that she sets, and they're scared of breaking it\n\nThis is Fi sorry. I describe people with this function as having invisible hoops that they expect people to jump through, yet neglect to tell people where they are because others "should just know". This attitude really bothers me because I am the exact opposite, and I feel that it causes unnecessary drama. I'm happy to do whatever anyone else wants, just tell me what that is!!! I don't want to have to guess! I'm guessing this is a reason for people avoiding her. \n\nFwiw, she sounds like an xNFP.
1	I am exactly the same way as her. I do feel like I have really high standards, and when someone doesn't meet them, I get let down and either quietly resent them or will call them out on it. I find it very difficult to let things do, and I will ruminate on them. It's something I have been working on in therapy--knowing that everyone is different, and learning acceptance. \n\nI also relate to the 'mothering' statement. ENFJs are thought of as mentors, teachers, and are more nurturing. We are very in tune with other's emotions,and sometimes this can be to our detriment. Some people will vent to us as if we were their therapists, and it can be very emotionally draining. We are afraid to put up those boundaries and deny them their ability to share with us, because we honestly want to help them. \n\nJust as u/KrayKray96 said, I do have the 'treat others the way you would like to be treated' mentality. \n\nI would begin an honest convo with her about these things if they bother you. These types of things are difficult to realize unless it's brought to your attention. It takes a lot of work to change your behavior based on your tendencies. 
1	I think one of two things is happening here. Either\n\nA) She shows she cares about people by doing nice things for them. (Whether or not they care about and determine this as nice, doesn't matter, in her mind it is.) So when she says "I spend hours every single week cleaning up after you!" what she really means is "I care about you, I do things to show I care about you, and right now I feel like you don't care about me in return."\n\nor \n\nB) Having a tidy house just really personally matters to her. The other roommates don't care about it so they make a bigger mess than she would have to clean up were she on her own, but she feels compelled to clean it up anyways because she can't live in a dirty house. If this is the case then it's a misalignment of values and she has 3 choices- 1) Accept that she's the only one that cares about having a tidy house and therefore clean it without resentment, 2) Talk to her roommates and say "I'm a person that really cares about having a tidy house. I can't change who I am, it just makes me feel nice to live in a clean house. Would you mind doing me a big favor and changing your lifestyle a bit to help accommodate my preferences?", 3) Move out and find roommates that value a tidiness to the same degree that she does.\n\nIn general she needs to re-evaluate the way she's interacting with the world. She has needs that she's not getting met (in either case) and she needs to learn to communicate about them out-rightly. She's not a complete weirdo for that, it's a constant growth and learning process for all of us.
1	I can relate to your ENFJs experience. I went through the same toxicities back then. When I became aware of these, I looked to Stoicism to tone things down. I learned to do the caring part because that's how I am, not because I want receive the same from others.
3	How to make you guys feel better when you're down?	Hey ENFJs..an INFP here. My fiancé is an enfj himself and he usually feels down and stresses out too much cause of work. And i usually feel awful cause i wanna make him feel better and i don't know how. So my question is what makes you feel better when you're down? How are you guys want to be cheered up? :)
9	I like it when my partner listens to me talk about what's bothering me. Then when I'm done getting it off my chest  I like doing something that distracts me like watching a movie together while cuddling  on the couch or going out for a walk. My love language is physical touch so making out, having sex, that kind of thing also tends to pick up my mood a lot. 
5	I think the biggest thing is that when ENFJs want to talk about their problem/stress, we are not looking for solutions. ENFJs just want someone to listen and repeat back what they think they're saying so they feel listened to. Typically we already know how to fix the problem.. we just want someone close to sit there and hang with us for a bit. No judgement... no explaining things like were dumb. Just listening. \n\nMy current boyfriend (ENFP) always tries to come and visit me after I've had a rough day. He always gives me a big hug to start. Always uplifting. One thing I really appreciate is when he sits and listens. Instead of saying how to solve it, he asks how I might solve it. For example, I get really down when my skin breaks out....instead of him saying, "why don't you try xyz", he asks how I want to fix the issue. And then from there he will attempt to help me with my plan.. (like for my skin issues he will bring over a certain face mask I talked about and some green juice to help with healing). It's the little things! \nI know I'm a girl so it's a bit different.. but just pick up on the things that he is saying and help encourage him to make a plan for himself. But don't force it. 
3	Let us vent! Give us some loving! Give us your full undivided attention!!
2	Talk to us. Let us vent. Offer some encouraging words. Try to help us solve our problem by giving advice, or just give us a big warm hug. :3
5	Myers-Briggs Tattoo (ENFJ)	
21	Oh-no! I'm mis-typed!! 
5	[deleted]
4	My brother introduced me to this subreddit the other day, I figured I would share my one and only tattoo with my fellow ENFJs. I got it on my right shoulder when I was 20, no regerts!
2	[kinda like this](http://s.quickmeme.com/img/ea/ea3d109f6b5403edc8b3754b71512962aa0c3f9ec3649cd370cc4c30c05fb738.jpg)
2	Out of all the types, this might be a good one to tattoo. An INTJ just won't have that same impact. :D

10	Going solo	It's just a thought that I came across.\n\nI'm an ENFJ myself (I took the test countless times, and that was the only answer it gave me) but I did realise I like to go solo for many things. \nWhenever given a choice on a project, I always, ALWAYS go solo if I know I can handle it.\n\nAm I one of the different ENFJs or have I not understood ENFJs (despite being one myself) enough yet?
15	Can't speak for everyone, but I definitely share this sentiment. I have trouble with boundaries, so in groups I always end up feeling responsible for more than my share, which really sucks.\nThat said, I enjoy and excel in formally structured teams where people have clearly defined roles and expectations are laid out before starting work.
8	You might be an introverted extrovert. I'm an ENFJ, but prefer working alone too. However, assign me group projects and somehow I almost always end up in the leader role. I used to believe that meant taking on more responsibilities. But once I learned to delegate tasks and figure out what motivates individual team members (acknowledgement, interests, etc), group projects became very rewarding experiences.\n\nIf you know you have introverted tendencies, it doesn't make you any less of an ENFJ if that's the personality type you have. At the center of it, we're all very different individuals.
2	You don't have to be one certain way all of the time in order to be an ENFJ.  I can be rather introverted, but I'm still ENFJ. I also like working alone on projects if I'm given the option. 
2	I don't think it's necessarily an introvert thing. It's just that when you're with other people, your main focus *is those other people* and it makes it harder to get things done. That's how I am anyway. When I'm hanging out, I always want someone around. When I'm working on something that takes thought, stay away from me please.

8	Experiences with ENFJ-ENTP relationships?	I've only ever had insane chemistry with 3 types: INFJ, ENFJ and ENFP. Even though I draw in different types, they're the only matches with mutual attraction for me. Less with ENFP nowadays, since I know it doesn't work in the long run.\n\nNow I'm in a place where I'm drawing in this ENFJ and I'm super attracted to her. Attracted like damn zombies to brains. She is smoking hot, smart, intellectual, successful, she seems everything I've ever wanted in a woman. From a distance it seems like the ultimate relationship regarding timing, chemistry, intellect, everything. That fun power couple thing. She's not a drama queen either. She doesn't want that shit, she's an emotionally stable Fe dom. Can you believe it? Sorry guys, I've just never experienced that before from close distance.\n\nIt's the first time in ages I'm afraid someone doesn't like me back even though she has clearly indicated interest. She makes me feel things, unease, so early. This is really out of character for me to be afraid to crash and burn and get stabbed in the heart. And I consider myself very emotionally mature.\n\nI see many paths here. The not so good paths will crash and burn or lose interest. Whatever happens, I'm jumping in with both feet from the get go. This is too good to pass up. Does anyone have experience with said combo? What joys, problems to expect? Is there something I can do wrong to drive her away, make her lose interest? I know there are a lot of things she could do to drive me away but none of them seem to be happening.\n\nEdit: I'm now realizing this is a momentary mindfuck with my self-esteem. I'm treating this girl like a treasure and it's making my self-esteem go crazy. Maybe it's normal when you find someone you really like. I should still keep my head in check.
7	The same thing happened to me, but I'm an ENFJ and he is an ENTP. It was great and both of us were "sprung", we were really feeling each other. We enjoy each other's company and he became a catalyst of growth for me- mentally and emotionally. But he started rushing things, which led to the "crash and burn" situation. He is very egotistical, which I never had a problem until he wants to be very public with us dating because we looked good and other superficial things. I value my privacy and solitude, so I come off very reserved (and I am not lol, I just enjoy the comfort of my own company because that's how I recharge my mental, emotional, and spiritual) and he wasn't on board with me. That caused a rift and he is very friendly with women and has withdrawal issues. Although him and I are still attracted to each other and still have this connection, we aren't dating or even "talking." My advice to you is take it slow and asses your feelings for each other and go from there. But since she is an ENFJ woman, you have to be really sensitive about addressing it because she might think you're not interested. 
7	My husband is an ENTP (I am ENFJ). We work super well together, but have had to work on some things (like all healthy relationships) to get to where we are now. We have been together for 6 years and are still extremely happy and fulfilled.\n\nI am much more emotional than he, so we have worked on this. He has worked to help address my emotional needs and open up more to me. This has made a huge difference in connecting and handling sensitive things that inevitably arise in the relationship. I also need to remember that he needs space when processing emotional turmoil in his life and give him time to process. Sometimes he doesn't want to talk (when I do) and that's ok. \n\nWe have worked to improve our arguments and conflict resolution skills. Most of our issues were that I wanted to talk about things long after my husband felt they were resolved. I was still emotionally upset about things. Again, recognizing our differences has helped this. He gives me more emotional feedback and I work to let things go without "beating a dead horse". Patience on both sides goes a long way. \n\nAll of this being said, we very rarely argue-but when we do, it's constructive and we are goal-oriented (how can we avoid having this ame argument in the future?) This satisfies both of us-my husband's desire to fix things and move on and my emotional need to feel cared for and understood. \n\n\nJoys of our match:\n\nWe both love to host parties and entertain, which is awesome. I get to plan it all out (which I love) and we both get enjoyment of being with our friends. \n\nHe helps me be more spontaneous and less serious. \n\nWe both make each other laugh and encourage each other to try new things. \n\nHe helps me sort through problems with a less emotional viewpoint; I help him remember emotional needs of others (in work, friends, etc)\n\nHigh self esteem and assuredness in each other and ourselves - neither partner relies on the other to be their cheering section. \n\nThere are so many others.....\n\nThis pairing can be awesome. We have been super passionate and hot and heavy early on. It's hard to imagine a time before each other because we "click" so well. 
5	How to criticize an eNFJ effectively?	How do you go about criticizing an ENFJ without hurting their feelings?  I feel like if you sugarcoat things too much the message doesn't even get across.  I am an ISTP so I come off as very blunt.  
15	1. show concern for his well being. \n2. offer your criticism in the form of an advice, not as brutal criticism.\n3. encourage him and acknowledge when you see progress\n\nas an ENFJ, I may be sensitive, but I welcome constructive criticism as it helps in the lifelong quest for self improvement.
5	Depends on what's to be criticized (emotional volatility, physical appearance, behaviour, values etc).\n\nIn all cases, lay it gently. By gently, I mean, be honest but instead of "you suck at x", better to say how it makes you'd feel "I feel Y when you do Z and I'd like to talk about that".\n\nENFJs aren't unreasonable, just sensitive. 
4	Use analogies and stories, and then ask questions at the end to make them admit their mistakes/faults/improvements. 
3	Talk about the issue in terms in how it makes you feel. ENFJ's tend to be empathetic. By expressing your problem in a way they can imagine themselves in your shoes, they may be more receptive to your criticism. As an ISTP, talking about how you feel may seem like a wishy-washy way of explaining something. But for most ENFJ's, they'll appreciate it. \n\nI'm an ENFJ, surrounded by ISTP friends (and SO). My biggest problem is being pushy without realizing it. Vague cues go over my head sometimes. Talking problems out calmly & transparently, while appealing to my emotional side has helped me be more conscientious of others. Likewise, if your ENFJ friend has some fair criticism for you, let them converse with you about it. Don't just drop the bomb and walk away without giving them a chance to react.\n\nGood luck!
3	Good luck my dude lmao. Gotta amp up that Fe way more than you would personally appreciate, as a lot of Fe doms I've known take Ti detachment very personally. \n\nI usually say what I need to first, then damage control later, but that's not much fun for anybody. 
1	Just don't make us feel stupid and you're good. I know I always try and compare whatever I'm saying to myself. \nEx: if someone's being really irrational about a little situation.. I say I totally know how you feel.. I get a upset when xyz happens. That being said it's best to try and find the positives! I know that always helps me! \n\nTrying to place yourself in the same position makes it a bit more bearable to hear. I know if someone says they struggle with something too, I'm a little more open to hearing what they are saying. 
4	ENTP with ENFJ	Hello persons of the ENFJ world, ENTP here!\nI'm currently in a situation with an ENFJ that I used to be attracted to and she used to feel the same about myself, but now our friendship in general is fading. She would still like to be friends, but I've definitely started moving on.\nFrom many sources I've read that ENFJs are not very good at getting over someone quickly, is this true? Just in case you are unaware, ENTPs (including myself)tend to get over people or things fast. Do you think that if this friendship ends then it will hurt her or take forever for her to get over me? I'm curious because I really don't want to hurt her, but am losing interest very quickly.\n\nThanks for taking your time to read this and possibly comment👍🤓.
6	Unless they are my closest girlfriends, I get over friends particularly quickly. \n\nI am not okay with sticking around and sacrificing my dignity for someone who doesn't care about my existence or our friendship.
2	If you're particularly special to the ENFJ, I'm sure you'll hold a special place in their heart for a while. In the future, she may Ni Ti about you and remember lessons learned, etc. \nBut don't burden yourself with worrying about her. She'll recover, center, and find new friendships/relationships to stimulate her in time. 
1	Haha, it's subjective.  I know in terms of friendship, it hits me hard when I see a friendship fade.  Back in high school, I had a falling out with my bffl.  It took me like 3 years to get over the pain.  However, at around late college, I don't really care so much anymore.  I understand that friendships don't last and get over them pretty quickly.  It is preferable there would be a talk before the split like in a relationship, but people would rather disappear and fade out of each other's lives in this case.
1	in a very familiar situation except on the ENFJ side...thank you for the insight on your side 😔
1	From my personal experience, I have really close friends who drifted apart due to job and location restrictions, but this did not bother me. I also had love interests who met the same fate, but it also did not bother me. These were all amicable parting of ways and I'm pretty sure if we meet again we'll still get along pretty well.\n\nHowever, getting hurt and seeing the person responsible moving on is a different scenario. These wounds take long to heal no matter how hard I struggle to move on. Seeing the other person being indifferent to my pain stings. But then, this is just me.\n\nI'd like to think you are still in good terms with your ENFJ. I don't think she'll be devastated should you drift apart so long as it is an amicable parting.
9	ENFJ and writing	Hey, I've recently been interested in taking up writing. What do you think our mbti type should mostly pay attention to during the story writing process and alike? Anything that you've noticed and find helpful is welcome here.
13	The J function and perfectionism: I get stuck thinking of the perfect way to phrase things that I end up not writing anything, get super stressed, and grind the F function to the ground. \n\nTip: commit to write 200 words, shitty or perfect. Just start writing and let the action fuel motivation. Unhinge the drive to have things be perfect/great...just start doing. 
1	Don't revise until you're done, completely done, with the first draft. I've gotten stuck in revision hell too many times to count.
1	Best strategy I've ever used is writing for my older sibling. It works wonderfully because I'm not too worried or too overly sappy, and even if I write a school essay I tend to do it with that person in mind. Doesn't have to be a sibling obviously but try out writing thing with certain people and see if you like it/it works for you. 
8	I feel empty	Hello everyone. I'm an ENFJ and 4w5 sp/so. (5 years of studying enneagram and MBTI leads me to this conclusion).\n\nHmm, while I lived in my house in rural area in a third world country, I wrote a lot. I wrote something everyday, mostly symbolic things and they were very hard for other people to understand them. Back then, I felt kind of full. Full of ideas, full of emotions, full of myself.\n\nBut since I moved to the most developed (and crowded and polluted and chaotic) city in my country (to study at university), I suddenly lost the connection with my inner side. I feel confused about what happened. I just found the love I've always longed for. I'm studying at the most well-known university in my country. I'm free to do whatever I want.\n\nAm I supposed to feel happy and fulfilled?\n\nInstead I just feel empty, that I'm wasting my time, that I'm not living up to my expectation, that I'm a fake person running around trying to be "successful" and "beautiful" like everyone else.\n\nAny ENFJ here is feeling or felt the same as I do now? If yes, then feel free to share your story here. Maybe we can help each other out.\n\n(Sorry for bad English, English is not my native language.)\n\nThank you for reading.
3	Heyo, I've been through this before, and I've got a bit of it happening right now. I have always wanted to be creative and to do something creative with my life. I'm in my senior year in college for a bachelors in computer science... but I want to write music, not do computer science. Makes me feel like I'm a failure a bit.\n\nI'm out of it now because I have a plan and I'm working super hard on writing a musical. You have to work at it, whatever it is. I'm spending hours every day working on this and it's the most fulfilled I've ever felt; even through the writer's blocks and stuff it's still good because I know I have a plan and I'm executing it well. \n\nThe main thing is, no matter how good your external circumstances are, if you're not pleased with yourself, you're not gonna be happy. Find the thing in your life that's keeping you from finding yourself and make a change to eliminate that thing.
14	Moderator Message. Low Effort Posts.	Hey All.\n\nRecently, we've been seeing a lot of what I would call "low effort" posts: titles with no content, questions that we've seen only a thousand other times, discord server invites, etc.\n\nSomebody actually reported a discord server invite as spam, which... while it's not spam, I'm sure a lot of us feel like it kind of is xD.\n\nSo, from now on, we'll be coming down a little harder on low effort posts like this. Here are some FAQ if you're thinking about making a post and you're wondering if it's okay.\n\nQ) Where can I find ENFJs?  \nA) Everywhere you can find other people. We're not aliens.\n\nQ) INFPxENFJ right???  \nA) Sure, sometimes. No, other times. It's not magic.\n\nQ) Can you join our discord server?  \nA) Probably not, actually, unless you've got something truly unique that isn't just "Typology Server. We need an ENFJ for our quota"\n\nQ *this one isn't frequently asked, but I'm sure it will be now*) What's an example of a good post?  \nA) Here: https://www.reddit.com/r/enfj/comments/6tbpd8/how_do_you_respond_to_i_hope_this_isnt_weird_for/?st=j777jrh0&sh=e208cd8c\n\nThis is cool because it's asking about a specific thing, something that could easily be unique to ENFJs, has some backstory, and it looks like OP put some thought in.\n\nAnother good post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/enfj/comments/6vr5ro/thoughts/?st=j777opt0&sh=684a114c\n\nThis one is cool because it brings up an interesting (even if I personally thought it was disturbing) passage and sparks discussion.\n\nEven relationship posts are okay, though we seem to get a never-ending barrage of those too xD.\n\nBasically, please, think before you post.\nThank you.
5	I'd like to add that we don't discourage posts about INFPxENFJ, people can share their experiences and ask questions in regards to them.\n\nThe mods want posts that will have some sort of discussion.  Discord join requests are typically just advertisement and don't really contribute much to conversation.
2	What are your experiences with ISFJs?	So yeah ISFJ here and I am curious about what do you think of my typ. What are you experiences?
6	I feel really sad when ISFJs think they are unimportant/ bland/ boring because they are usually polite and try to recede into the background in a large social group. \n\nI can feel from them this overwhelming sense of wanting to be involved/ included/ social; they just gotta find the right friend to ease them into it. When they are a bit more comfortable socially, they can be so engaging and charming.\n\nAn ISFJ birthed me; I have liked every single one I've met.
3	My favorite person in the world is an ISFJ :) (my little sister) I know two others besides her.\n\nY'all are stable, calming, and are fun people to talk to and share things with for forever at a time xD.
1	I'm an ENFJ and my boyfriend is an ISFJ. I find them to be one of the most wonderful type of person in the entire MBTI grouping. This is so cliche but he really has been the wind beneath my wings. I dream big and long for a more loving understanding world. Sometimes when I feel saddened by the harsh realities and especially in my world (social worker) he is right there to help me back up and kiss me tenderly on the forehead. Our relationship is one that endlessly pours back and forth with appreciation. He enjoys my warm and bubbly personality that easily allows for us to engage in ice breakers and conversation. While I adore his unwavering stoicism and stability. It's a wonderful matching if I might say! Which is why I felt so inclined to respond. Most of the things I've read do not mark us a good mix. However I feel as though no one understands me as well as a ISFJ!  
1	Had a 2 year relationship with someone I think was an ISFJ. Life ain't easy for her and she's found herself in a career field that she doesn't like and that isn't kind to her. Long and deep bouts of depression via that. Beyond that though, my ISFJ was one of the kindest people I've ever met. Though she carries many mental burdens, she'd sacrifice ANYTHING to help people she cared about. She's also quite the doer and loves working with her hands and getting home projects done. Was wonderful to see her immerse herself in a task. I hope she finds a career in the future that is better for her. I think that alone will completely change her world view. 
1	One of my best friend's is an ISFJ and I dated one before and she was a wonderful human. I agree with all the other comments, and would like to add that ISFJs do a good job of keeping me grounded in reality but are also playful and fun to spend time with. You guys always seem to make the morally correct choice and I have a lot for respect for that. Keep doing you!!!
1	My dad's an ISFJ type. My general impression is that he's warm but a little socially awkward. Genuinely well meaning, but comes off as insensitive at times. Gets a little anxious when there isn't a plan, but I can always count on him.
14	How long have you waited for the other person to initiate?	I get mentally weary of always being the one to first suggest plans or start a conversation. Sometimes I just stop doing so and see how long it takes for the other person to pick up their end. \n\nThe thing is, the longer it takes, the more hurt I feel and the more I sense the relationship needs help.\n\nThis is a relationship with friends, not romantic. I think this person is an INFJ, but I don't remember. 
10	A few years ago I made the conscious decision to stop chasing people around like this, and dedicate my efforts to people who actually reciprocate. It was tough at first because I didn't see the people I was used to, but I later realized that I felt like making plans with them out of a sense of obligation rather than because I really missed them.\n\nI'm still up for hanging out with these types, but unwilling to act as their social coordinator anymore
4	I've tried waiting for a friend but after only 2 weeks I get so upset I tell the person. The issue is if they plan something immediately afterward I feel like it's not genuine.
3	This is a problem I used to have, and I remember quite vividly feeling terrible about this kind of thing, but for some reason I no longer get it. I've just learned how to not care about it I guess? I know who my friends are even if they don't initiate things.
2	This is one of my weakest points. Its not something i like about myself and the only reason i really have no friends. I want so badly to connect with other people but i have to be connected to myself first. I have to be in touch with myself and if i have other things going on in life like work it usually takes a lot longer to come back in tune with myself. I'm kind of curious how enfjs can be around so many people all the time and still hear their own thoughts. How do you know your leading a life you want and not what everyone else wants? I appreciate the love and warmth enfjs shower the world. I think the enfj takes friendships very personally and feel like it's a reflection of themselves when there's not a constant connection. Everyone's realities are different and while I'm daydreaming there is no timeline also in any relationship. Id rather a deep connection. When i actually have something i WANT to communicate seems like a better friendship to me than a constant shallow one but i am an INFP :)
2	I struggle with this as well. My only ENFJ friend is very kind and almost always responds, but I don't really bother people much. Weirdly enough I have a very close ISTJ friend who NEVER responds in chat messages, but we meet every week and talk for hours - I think he's just shy about messages or something.\n\nWhat this reminds me of is a similar question. When I recommend a movie to a friend or a friend recommends a movie/article/book to me - usually people say "I'm definitely going to read/watch that" and then they don't. \n\nI don't like that. I'm sure nobody is intentionally lying, but it would be better if people replied that they will try if they have the time. Some people do say that, but this is just a thing that has been nagging me for a while. This is not good for building/maintaining trust. All movies/articles I recommend I take very seriously and I feel other's just don't. You don't have to do what I say, but that reply seems disingenuous.
4	Thoughts on INTPs	Im an INTP and ive heard that INTPs and ENFJs make good friends or couples. Now, I know this isnt true in ever cases but im just curious about your honest thoughts on us.
7	My best friend is an INTP and we work very well together. We balance each other out very well. When I become overwhelmed emotionally, he can help me sort through that in a way no one else can. He also has helped me not be so controlling as far as planning things out. Sometimes plans put too many restrictions on life. I am a dreamer type, and he really helps me see those dreams as a potential reality. I feel like I offer him the love, support, and verbal affirmation that he desires, but he doesn't want to admit to wanting. When he sees love and vulnerability as a weakness, I feel like I can quell some of those fears because our trust is so strong. So I think we both gain from out friendship. 
6	I love INTPs. They tend to have a sort of mysterious vibe to them. As if they can't be figured out right away. Maybe it's because our aspirational function as ENFJs tends to be introverted thinking. So you guys have something we wish we had. \nThe frustration I've had with some INTPs is that they tend to figure out what they want by actively processing verbally with someone who pushes them to dig. It can be a lot of responsibility, digging in someone to see if they even want you around (or to help them figure out if *they* do, for that matter). Sometimes it feels like my INTP friends don't notice my worth unless I'm with them in person, and that can make maintaining those relationships hard when those friends are also avoidant. \n\nOverall, I love INTPs, but I have to be careful when being around those that are not self-aware, as they can leave me feeling the need to prove my own worth, and that's something I don't ever want to feel need to do. 
2	My husband (INTP) and I (ENFJ) are celebrating our 10th anniversary today (and 17 years together). We have nearly nothing in common but our fundamental values and have exactly opposite skill sets.\n\nWe love each other immensely, have two kids, and I have no idea why it works.
2	ENFJ do you prefer INFP or INTP?	Or who is your go to person? We can include infjs  Im just curious to know you guys better and I've seen that enfj are drawn to both. And what makes you enjoy these types. What differences attract you more to one or the other? :) 
6	Well I'm married to an INTP. I love how we complement each other and are a superhero tag team. What he's good at, I'm not good at and what I'm good at, he's not good at. Makes division of labour easy in our home. I also love that we have the N in common - we like to analyze and discuss things like politics, current events, economics and our futures. \n\nOne great thing about an INTP partner is they are loyal and rational and keep your grounded. As an ENFJ I tend to be a people pleaser and have a hard time saying no. My INTP spouse holds me in check with his skepticism and trying to protect our family from too many demands on my time. It makes for a good balance. 
5	A person's type means so little to me in real life. I care more about whether you are a good, uplifting person and where your values lie, rather than how you define yourself wrt a personality theory that doesn't account for much of you at all.\n\nFor that reason, I could never pick between INFP and INTP. Or any of the 16 types for that matter
2	So exactly what does mbti tell you then? Because as an infp i literally live by my internal values. And i guess it depends on whose eyes are perceiving these values on weather they are good or uplifting but i asked from an enfj standpoint
1	What lawdoodette said.
0	Agreed but its not a thoery. Its the congnitive fuctions of your brain. I mean. You can expect someone with estp preference to be more of as ass ( donald trump) preferred to someone with isfj ( mother Teresa). 
2	How do ENFJs act while alone in a new place?	Info INFP hunting for ENFJs here\n\nENFJs are typically described as super popular and friendly people, but how do you spot one that's come to a social event without anyone they know? I'm related to two ENFJs but (obviously) I've never seen them in this situation 😛\n\nTo be less vague, the social event is a swing dance class at my university 😊
4	I'm fairly shy in new gatherings. Pretty awkward. But I'm able to make conversation easily. But a lot of that is my upbringing. I wasn't raised with male friends and I never really understood how to talk to men in public, so historically I am super friendly and initiate conversation with women, but borderline avoid conversation with men, especially if I find them attractive. That said, I've worked on that a lot and the less I care about going somewhere to meet someone the more I am social. But still awkward. Lol\n\nAnd for the record, I've never felt closer to any man than the INFPs I've dated. 
4	i go out and try to make a lot of new friends when i'm alone in a new place.  Talk and throw various topic starters to see what hooks and relates best with the new people. :3
4	Lots of INFP's trying to find ENFJ because some personality page says they're the best match... let me tell you something, it's not the best match according to socionics :P You should be looking for ESTJ's according to Model A from socionics ó_ó
2	I don't typically do that well in situations like that unless there's a structured activity that we are all doing. If it's just a freestyle party and I don't know anyone, I'm leaving unless I happen to catch a conversation that I'm interested in. If there's an activity or a game or something, that's a good handhold and I'll quickly be the networker in the room.u
2	i get really anxious and flustered on the inside – so i deal with this by talking to someone, even though the prospect of initiating conversation scares me a little and i usually have to consciously tell myself to just go for it before i do! & that someone is typically whoever looks most approachable. i usually go for people who are alone because it just makes sense (gives each of us the opportunity to Not Be Alone) and feels easier. :)
1	Where can I Meet ENFJs?	Title says all.
10	outside, where people are. \n
8	If someone starts asking you lots of questions about yourself and genuinely seems curious in you, you may have met one. Where are we? It's complicated. You can find me at a book store/library looking for a non fiction book or at a bar looking awkward and uncomfortable but friendly and fun to be around. 
2	Usually they'll introduce themselves to you.  They're that person that seemingly knows everybody.
2	Agreed. You're best bet is where other people are. Start looking around like you're waiting for someone to talk to you and cure your bordem, ENFJs will respond to the call
2	I'd say it's less about where you go and more about the kind of people you meet. ENFJs, like other extroverts, have a variety of different interests and safe places, but they can be picked out by their authentic interest in others. They typically seem intuitive right away, like they're reading things about you that others don't. And not only do they read those things, but they care. An ENFJ may be more or less confident in any situation depending on whether or not others they know are there. But what matters is that they tend to be bright and caring. 
10	I used to be hopeless romantic but now every relationship I'm in feels hallow. Can any ENFJ's relate?	I used to love being in a relationship and felt more fulfilled when I was in one (I was always fine with being single but relationships just came naturally). But now, I feel almost evil leading people on and have then finding them boring after a short amount of time. Have any other ENFJ's experienced selfishly bouncing around relationships because of the lack of passion after some time?
6	[deleted]
5	If you are truly leading people on, that's awful. Stop it.\n\nIf you are simply going on a date or two and then you find out they're not for you, that's a harder question. Either you just have bad luck, or you have a bit of bad judgment and get initially taken easily, or you are a little lazy and don't want to put in effort to a relationship. Not much more to say without more information.\n\nI've not had this problem, but I can't speak for all ENFJs.\n\nPS. "Hallow" means holy.\n\n
3	Maybe you lead with strong ideals. I know as an INFP we usually idealize our partners. If a potential person we date doesn't live up to those ideals, we can quickly determine what's wrong and end it. Of course, no one is perfect but you are not crazy for acting this way. It might merely be that you haven't found the right person yet. Usually you know as soon as you meet them but when you do usually the relationship will last a long time.
2	I can kind of relate. I was (am?) a hopeless romantic. I usually run full force ahead into something new but if I eventually perceive the person as awesome but it won't work out in the future for other reasons (i.e. distance or lifestyle choices) the relationship then feels empty.
6	INFP & ENFJ FOREVER <3	Someone please tell me a story about an ENFJ & INFP\n Pair working out. Friendship/relationship. Please tell me your stories. They make me warm and fuzzy. I dont want to give up on this pair. 
6	We have been together for a long time in a romantic way,8 months now.\nAnd as for friendship,more than a year,but it feels like we know each other for ages.\nWhat can i say,its great,she is my little sweet gf. i can give all my heart and soul to knowing that she wont let me down or hurt me,i just cherish and take great care of her,she does same things for me,we are completing each other in many ways,i cant write them all but good thing is ,you made me remember some real nice times in the past,even the start of our relations ... no problems except one time she was trying to pick on me with classic female things like,trying to make me jealous,but i explained her real fast that its not how i work.\nAll in all...id give this pairing 9.5/10,this 0.5 is because nothing is perfect,enjoy your day,dont give up on anyone...if two persons love each other enough anything is possible 
5	INFP guy friend: we have separate political views but regardless of our opinions we are still friends with one another.  We've had a lot of escapades when we were younger.  Went to a lot of rave events together and rescued one another from trouble many times.  We are great friends to this day.\n\nINFP gal friend: we met through my bestie ENFJ friend. she's super considerate and nice.  I always like hanging out with her when I visit my ENFJ best friend.  They are wonderful together with a lot of shared interests.  Right now they are working on themselves and trying to be better for one another.  They just got over a huuuuge obstacle in their relationship and now are going strong in their love for one another.\n\nI have an INFP bf whom I love and adore.  I love him to death and he's probably the longest bf I've ever had.  We both came out of a series of disappointment from relationships and on verge of giving up.  Once we met each other, we knew we had to go out.  Now we are both big derps who love to spend time with one another.
4	Oh man... I met my INFP guy at a music festival. I felt irresistibly attracted to him the second I met him. We instantly hit it off-- I felt like there was something about him... This amazing glow that radiated and made me feel so happy and safe... I felt like we were going to impact each other's lives in some way, silly as that sounds.\n\nAnyways, we stayed in contact after the festival. He lives alllll the way on the other side of the country... We were messaging each other every day-- then it moved on to phone calls that lasted 6 hours at a time... Then video chats that lasted 8 hours or more. We had endless conversations. There were no awkward pauses, we never ran out of things to talk about.\n\nWe continued on like this for about 2 months before we decided we wanted to meet again. So, I worked all through Christmas break and saved up enough money for a plane ticket. I was so nervous and excited to meet him. Butterflies were beating the shit out of my stomach, and nobody has that effect on me!\n\nI stayed with him and his family in the city, he took me to art museums and took me on adventures through the streets late, late, late at night.  I'd never felt so happy in my entire life. I felt like I had found my home.\n\n\nSaying goodbye to him at the airport was hard. Really hard. But I know in my heart that I'll see him again... Right now I'm working on college and he's working on certification in IT.   We both counsel each other in our lives in many different ways. I feel like after all these years, I've met someone who is able to reciprocate the kind of emotional support I give to others. Whenever life get hard, I remind myself that someone like him exists and I need to work hard if I want to move out of my humble Midwestern town if I want to be with him to make things work.\n\nWe're 10 years apart in age and, in terms of geographical distance, 1,700 miles away... But none of that matters. I've never felt so close to another human being.  
2	My best friend is an INFP and can spend whole days together for weeks at a time and not get bored. Or we're bored together. Either way we are always happy in each other's comapny. We have been best friends since 5 years old and we're in our 20s. He lived half way across the world for about a decade and nothing really changed when he moved back. It's actually quite romantic now that I type it out haha
1	My best friend is an ENFJ and it's amazing, and where it's not amazing, we always manage to talk things through and figure it out. I've been in love with him for a while, but it's not reciprocated. He is still the best friend I've ever had, though, and the friend I care most about in the world.
1	We were close friends for years but both in other relationships. When those ended around the same time, we started spending more one on one time together until confessing that we'd both always figured if we were single, we'd end up together. Then we did! He said he knew he cared about me and wanted to take care of me from the first day we met, when he noticed I was "different". \nWe've described it as not thinking anyone else was on this wavelength - we get each other in a way we had never expected to be understood. (We're both a bit.. eccentric. Flow against the current.) Our differences push us just out of our own comfort zones enough to help us grow. We are very patient with each other and respect our differences, and our arguments are usually very constructive. He is kind and considerate and listens to and remembers everything I say, even the little things. He feels like home. I prefer being with him than alone (my fellow INFPs understand how serious that statement is) I truly could have never imagined love could be this way - it's so much more than I ever dreamed possible. 
1	Just looking for a friend	I'm an infp male hoping for an online friend so I can get the benefits of anonymity when talking, hopefully this will allow me to open up a bit. Looking for a girl, not for any romantic reasons I just can talk to girls easier. PM me if you want to talk. 
3	what's up ma dude? how u feeling 
4	Where do ENFJs hang out?	Hi ENTP female! I love ENFJs, I think you all are very intriguing, for some odd reason, and I would like to know where can I find more of your type. Any tips?! 
7	Nowhere specific. Not for me anyway. Being of the more rare personality too, there's fewer of us. \n\nIf I were to spot an ENFJ, I'd try to look for the person everyone knows for some reason. Not the loudest person in a crowd, but the person who everyone seems to know or have heard of (in a good way) and most people say is nice. \n\nLol. Sorry it's not much help. 
6	with other enfjs
2	We really like social events and meeting new ppl lol
1	Mhmmmmm 
2	Alex Jones = ENFJ	How do you guys feel about having Alex Jones in your midst? Having watched a ton of his videos, I think it's pretty clear he's an ENFJ.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1UCGV441wQ\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuMNZZmImeA\n\nEven though I don't agree with any of his views, I find him a really fascinating and compelling speaker. He really views himself as on a mission to save humanity from the evil that surrounds him. He's definitely not a phony or a charlatan, he believes everything he says sincerely. While he is very intelligent, I think his problem is that he starts with many flawed premises, so his views aren't accurate, even though they're logical, if that makes sense.\n\nI love his passion and righteous anger. He's not a hater, he just really loves humanity and thinks it's under attack, so we have to act now in order to save the world.
4	I thought he was ESTJ tbh.\nI remember watching a lot of Alex jones in 2011 lol.\nGood times \n\nEdit:\nI have to agree with what you said about false premises. But much of the information he presents could be facts he found. \n\n

2	> even though they're logical\n\nAnyone can appear logical if they tell enough lies. If he's smart, his intellectual stock is in manipulation and keeping track of complex webs of fiction. He's a misanthrope. He should have been an honest novelist instead of whatever he is. 
2	I don't think he's completely sincere. He admitted in court that he plays a character on his show. Even though he is pretty eloquent and passionate, I think that he purposely overblows things in order to get people riled up and passionate about things to direct them towards what he thinks is the greater good. That is, actually, a very ENFJ thing to do. I wouldn't discount the thought that he is an ENFJ. It seems likely.
4	How do enfjs act on their feelings?	So im just going to throw out this scenario because im still trying to understand or cope with how enfjs handle their feelings. \n\nSo say  you have been in a serious relationship for 3 years or more. Its a good relationship as far as everyone is concerned but you have a best friend of the opposite sex that you have been friends with for years also and suddenly start to realize you have feelings for this friend and vise vera. Is this something your significant other should have been worries about all along even though they are understanding of your need for friends? Do you act on your feelings for your friend? \nAny answers are welcome. This is really just an infp being cautious. I want so bad to be understanding of enfjs need for friends but also have read multiple times of enfjs developing feelings for friends after years? Thanks xx  
9	I'm an ENFJ male and have dated an INFP female before. While I haven't been in this particular scenario, I can see how an ENFJ might develop feelings after years. I don't think my significant other should ever have to worry about me developing feelings for another person though. A healthy relationship, regardless of MBPT, requires trust on both side. If you think this person may cheat, it is best to communicate this and explain why you are concerned. If an ENFJ cares deeply about the relationship there is no excuse for infidelity. \n\nI do agree that us ENFJs love to have a lot of friends and crave attention from multiple sources. Polygamy in theory would be great for us since we like to juggle several relationships, but ultimately I think most of us just want that one person who will always be by our side. Yes, it is tough at times when in a monogamous relationship, but it's our responsibility (not yours) to know our tendencies and draw the line when a friendship becomes more.\n\nIn this case, the fact that this friend reciprocates feelings makes it a much greater temptation. I honestly do not know what I would do if I were your significant other. The right thing to do would be to end one of the two relationships, but we hate not having things be ideal in our personal relationships (one of our biggest flaws).\n\nIt sounds to me like you are very understanding of the ENFJs need for friends, so it is only fair that we are understanding of your fear about us having certain friends. It's not uncommon to develop feelings for another person in a long term relationship, but it would be wrong for any person, ENFJ included, to act on those feelings. \n\nHopefully this helps! I'd be happy to answer other questions you might have and best of luck with this situation. \n\n
5	i wouldn't act on it. I'd probably spend less time with my friend and reaffirm my relationship with my significant other.  If the feelings are too strong tho to ignore, I'd do my significant other a favor and be honest about these feelings.  It's a tough situation to be in and really depends on how much you'd rather be with your friend instead of your S.O.  You never really know though.  \n\nDon't group all enfj's together.  FYI.  If you think that our go to thing is to develop feelings for our besties after years and go for it at the expense of our current lovers, that's not cool. :P
2	That is so reassuring to hear. Thank you. Its not what i want to think its actually just a big fear. But i know its only because i don't completely understand extroverted feeling so thank you so much for your insight. \n
2	I think Jay offered some good insight about talking out your feelings with your ENFJ. Cognitively, most of us ENFJ's respond well to talking things out. If you're able to set up the conversation in a way your SO can imagine himself in your shoes, he might be understand your perspective better. 
1	Thank you jay!! It really helped my heart. You guys really are the most amazing humans. Thank you for clearing this up for me.\n\nAlso. Please ignore if its too much heartache to get into..but i would really like to know any issues you faced with your infp and how she could have better handled them?
1	I'm ENFJ and polyamorous so having feelings for other people is pretty normal for me. If you do want to start a relationship with someone other than your current monogamous partner though you should be ethical about it and talk to your current partner about what you want first. Not to get their permission but to peruse any relationships you have ethically and honestly.
1	Thank you sooo much! I am not used to talking out my feelings but this has given me more reassurance to do so :)
5	ENFJs who are (or have been) in love with an INFP, what was it that made you fall in love with them?	What are the traits that you absolutely adore about them? What moment made you realize you were in love?
16	I love that they see things. I can't describe it but INFPs will take everything in and they remember tiny little details of conversations and things that would seem insignificant to most. Also, their quirky sense of humor is wonderful.\n\nBut in all honesty, falling for an INFP is a minefield and I'm still picking up the pieces rn. The fact that they are absolutely incapable of confrontation and rather deal with things on their own is so frustrating, especially for an ENFJ (at least I'd say so)\n
10	They're unique. Hard to figure out, they seem enigmatic. Often times hurting, they tend to have suffered from or are suffering depression or loneliness. They're intimately acquainted with the feeling of 'saudade'. I also quite like artistic girls, which they tend to be. And they're very rare. Only met a few in my life.\n\nThey're nuanced, complex individuals and exude a sort of fragile softness that's utterly endearing.
10	So many things. I love the way they approach moral dilemmas. I can tell they are pure in their intentions and very selfless. And they listen--to me, to strangers, to anyone who wants to talk. In many ways the INFP represents my version of an ideal human being. They are relentlessly kind, caring, loving, genuine, empathetic, and all without expecting this in return. \n\nI also love the combination of being goofy and childish while also being mature and sophisticated. We seem to share the idea that things like happiness, laughter, love, silliness and optimism are important, but also that being serious and professional is sometimes necessary. \n\nPerhaps my favorite thing was talking about philosophical and moral situations. My INFP ex and I used to talk for hours about hypotheticals, and she always listened to me rant and geek out. \n\nAbove all I appreciate the INFP character. I wish everyone were like you guys sometimes. Also the sex is really hot with the dominance and submission clearly laid out lol
7	how honest and clear he was.  Very kind and derpy in his own way.  we talked for 8 hours straight when we first met at a club.
5	Obviously this was in the infatuation stage of the relationship. It kind of all broke 6 months later or so, but here you go xD. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/3p8xvd/if_i_am_human_you_are_a_fairyland/
4	Well, after three years of secret feelings for each other underlying our friendship, my INFP and I recently declared our love for each other! However, the love has been building for a while.\nSome of the traits that I really love about him are his thoughtfulness and depth. He can still recall things I said in passing from three years ago, or things that I wore.\nAnd he's so deep, he makes me feel like a surfacey kind of person sometimes! Which is pretty amazing because I've always felt myself to be a pretty deep, soulful person. \nHe also has a depth of feeling, if that makes sense. He's the only person I've ever met that can feel as deeply as I can. \nI think what made me fall in love with him is that he feels like my other half. \nI wasn't surprised at all when I learned his MBTI a few weeks ago.\n
3	their kindness. and thoughtfulness. they just cared more than anyone else I ever met. whether it was making sure I was okay to bringing me a book they thought I might like. they were open to learning about the other weird things I was into (aka things like this, I asked them to take the test) and showed interest to make me not feel silly about my passions. theyre so unique and they just wanted the best for everyone. they were true healers. (they were also an 11 in numerology and scorpio sun/pisces moon/virgo rising if anyone is into those)

4	Thoughts about Si, Se, Ni and Ne, context, cross-context, worldview, and possibilities	Thoughts about Si, Se, Ni and Ne, context, cross-context, worldview, and possibilities\n\n* Si and Se deal with real experiences directly.\n* Ni and Ne deal with patterns and connections.\n* Si and Ni are concerned with worldview.\n* Se and Ne are concerned with possibilities.\n\nNi/Se and Si/Ne work together as pairs:\n\n* Ni/Se operate within one context at a time. Se usually focuses on the present context, but Ni can mentally shift the context in space/time so Se can have a look at it.\n* Si/Ne are cross-contextual. So Si builds up insights over time, and Ne uses it as a springboard to find parallels between situations, objects, ideas, anything.\n\nTherefore:\n\n* Ni builds its worldview by looking at patterns and connections within a single context at a time.\n* Si builds its worldview by looking at real experiences across contexts.\n* Se finds possibilities by looking at real experiences in a single context.\n* Ne finds possibilities by looking at patterns and connections across contexts.\n
3	I think this is a brilliant analysis of two very vague and hard-to-pin-down functions. Agree with the Ne/Si statements being INFP, will have to take your word for the Ni/Se side as it's a bloomin mystery to me Haha! 
3	Nice analysis. I want to add;\n\nI think it really depends which function is more dominant. I am very observant of my surroundings that relate to people. My Ni will be constructing patterns as I'm experiencing things, and I remember my understanding rather than the actual facts (although I have almost perfect recall for conversation). I immediately notice when someone is acting out of character as it triggers a flag to go off in my mind. My Ni will jump on it and continue to gather information in the present to form a conclusion. This makes me good at reading people as I can compare themes of behaviour over time.\n\nMy ESFP friend, with dom Se, is very focused on the present moment, and practical interactions. She will see patterns and meaning in each moment, but due to her inferior Ni, she has trouble creating long term patterns. She cannot seem to make connections between different events that have happened over months, and instead has a very close view on the now.\n\nPerson X says "I'm really annoyed by something you did/said"\nSe/Ni - They are hating me rn \nNi/Se - I wonder what I did/said that triggered something, so I know for the future\nSi/Ne - They're annoyed. This means that it's going to be more difficult interacting with them in the future because I will remember this and assume that this thing will always annoy them.\nNe/Si - What could they be annoyed about? That's an interesting response. I did/not expect them to react like that. I wonder if they will always respond like that.

2	locking this because this is a low effort post which doesn't contribute to discussion.
1	i don't know what there is to discuss. 
4	Wanting to be more than friends with younger guy	I just finished working with a guy yesterday. We were freelance on contract, so we will not be working together again. We worked together for about 4 months and we got very close near the end... Lots of flirting with each other (though I'm a Libra and an ENFJ so that means I do have the tendency for guys to read me sometimes as flirting with everyone so sometimes guys aren't sure if I'm actually flirting with them or if I'm just super friendly with everyone). We hung out outside of work a few times, but only ever in a group with work people (though him and I were often off on the side having personal conversations together). Co-workers would often shoot him and myself "knowing" looks when we were out and even at work as if they were onto us and our flirting (not in a bad way, just in a "I see what you're doing, you guys act like little teenagers together" sort of way). We just giggled at each other a lot. It was pretty adorable.\n\n\nI'm not sure what I'd want out of the relationship - either a friends with benefits kind of thing, or an actual relationship. I guess I'd have to see if our age difference would get in our way, or not. And of course see if we can even be good together as more than friends. I adore him as a person and honestly the attention he showed me was wonderful and I loved it. My face would hurt sometimes from laughing so hard with him. And even though he's younger than me, I feel like we "get" each other really well and actually have a lot in common. I'd like to tell him I'm interested, but not sure how to go about it (I'm not very good about these things as an ENFJ since I tend to get nervous that I'm creating something there that isn't really there... but I don't think so this time). I want to show him I'm interested in a clear way so that he doesn't try to read too much into it, and I put it out there concisely that I'm interested in being more than friends. \n\n\nWhat are your thoughts?
10	don't mix horoscope with MBTI.. please..
3	Go for it! But don't beat yourself over it if it's not for him. 
2	If you two enjoy spending time together and there is a sexual/romantic attraction then why not? The only real thing to be careful of is to not baby or take care of him like hes helpless. Besides that I'd say go for it. 
1	Go for it!!! Nothing wrong with a little age difference, don't let other people's opinion sway your decision. Worst case scenario it doesn't work out
6	Took a personality test before being hired as a case manager a month and a half ago, revisiting the personality test, I retook it to verify it was correct to find myself at the same conclusion	After finding the same verdict, ENFJ is exactly in every way who I am. My lord. For career choices, it suggests social worker, something I intend on becoming in the near future. Very insane stuff people.
3	Cosy and peaceful new 300+ user typology Discord server Identification looking for members. :)	Focuses on function-based MBTI, but there are also tags for enneagram, instinctual variants, tritype, alignments and Hogwarts houses.\n\nThe majority of the users are introverted intuitive types as usual on online typology communities, but somehow the most plentiful on this server so far has been the INFJ type, compared to it usually being INTP.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/qCRNuRZ
5	Very Few Friends!!	As ENFJ (26 F), I have only 4 close friends, despite I know many people but I do not share with them much of my life, and I keep a distance. Is it normal? 
9	Not really. Studies show most adults in the USA at least have no more than two close friends at best. 
6	I'm pretty much the same way except I'm 27 lol.  I have 5 close friends and the rest I'm pretty open with but I hang when they hit me up.
6	I'm F20 and I have one close friend and my boyfriend who I'm very close to.  There are many other friends, but those are the two that I open up to.  Normal is just a setting on the dryer. 
5	4 is too many! \n\nNo, but be thankful you have friends. 
2	I'm the same. The problem is that the friends I do share a lot with always think that I'm this way with everyone else. \n\nBut that's not true. I don't mind grabbing coffee with an acquaintance and a lot of people tend to trust me easily so they unload their problems on me but I won't share much in return. 
1	IMO I think that depends on you. You may just be more predisposed to confiding in certain people. And being extroverted doesn't mean you should naturally have a higher quota for close friends. 
2	have you ever dated or been with someone with Avoidant Personality Disorder?	What was it like? Your experiences? Tips?
6	Yes, it's extremely hard to keep things together whilst even slightly meeting the needs of both parties. They love/miss/want you the most when you are distant and apart from them. This makes you feel loved and want to draw close. And from there on in, you can only lose as they get less and less attracted to you, and more and more distant and withdrawn. It broke my heart ultimately and really I was never able to attach or trust fully (im anxious/fearful attachment so that brings its own set of problems) because when I would reach out for reassurance and get snubbed, the anxiety escalates, escalates, try for reassurance again, get pushed away, escalate escalate until your emotions have no choice but to detach from them as the source of reassurance. When this happens in thousands of different ways over the course of a relationship you can be left with an empty shell of a relationship (and of who you once were). \n\nIn short, it's really hard, I don't believe anything is impossible but it will hugely depend on how willing you both are to work on it. Probably needs some therapy level intervention, it's so ingrained in them to feel terrified/repulsed by intimacy that it's hard to overcome.\n\nWhat I would say for you, if you are in this relationship and going to stay, is examine and learn about your own attachment style; identify and confront the actions that break down intimacy (small example from my own life: no eye contact during kissing or sitting by each other or in the bedroom). Identify how you want to be treated - e.g., how you want to be reassured when you're anxious, and tell them (also mention that you're more likely to stop bothering them if they just sacrifice their own needs for distance at first to quench your anxiety). You will have to control all your emotional responses until they become rational discussions - I found it impossible to do this until the relationship was practically over and all my passion had died. Don't accept any contemptuous reactions (and don't give them yourself of course) but contempt and resentment kill a relationship (look up Gottmans 4 horsemen of the apocalypse) but they can appear when someone is actively trying to minimise intimacy and they're very effective. Oh and make the dismissive partner actually dig inside and identify what they want; I think they're used to acting 'normal' because they kinda do want relationships and they mimic others. But their needs are actual needs and they are very unique to them.  The more they try to act 'normal attachment' the more their resentment and anger and fear builds and builds. And this will spill out in your interactions, often in a passive-aggressive way. So you'll want to find out exactly what level of contact they're comfortable with. \n\nOnce you have both identified a list of daily/weekly things you need in the relationship to keep satisfied, you'll need to take an honest look and see if you can really meet each other's needs. You know that feeling when you see or hear someone else's relationship described and think 'ugh I could *not* tolerate *that* coldness...' or whatever, listen out for that in your heart. \n\nIf you are not currently involved in a relationship with them, I would strongly advise you to move on OP, I'm so sorry to say that. But all the literature online says dismissive attachment is nearly impossible to correct, and it often partners with cluster B personality traits or lack of empathy, compassion etc.  You've probably googled it all already. Also google intimacy avoidance, there's a lot of useful stuff about that online. \n\nFeel free to ping back any further discussion points OP, wishing you luck with all your decisions. And this is my personal experience based on extensive reading but I'm not a professional, and I can't speak for everyone's relationship so just bear that in mind as you're weighing up your options. But I think my advice to run away if you're not committed is matched by what a lot of the professionals are saying online.
2	of course, people switch all the time from anxious to avoidant. especially ENFPs.  \nthis is a culture of avoidance.  in the romantic scene \ntips depend on your attrbutes and theirs. if u have stroong logic use it.  if not, manipulation considering its ENFJ den, probabil the later 
9	Thoughts?	
7	can kinda relate because when I get excited I end up talking over my friends sometimes and forgetting to listen.  I'm better about it now.
3	What does this mean to you, OP? I feel like I'm on the brink of understanding what it means, but not an ENFJ so not sure exactly what this feels like or looks like in non-metaphorical form?
3	To me I instantly thought of being able to uniquely talk and come across to that particular person and relate to them individually in order to please them. Chameleon affect of relating to everyone.
2	I really love metaphorical passages like this. Just, poetry mmmm. \n\nI can't quite decide what I think it means, but I like the ambiguity :)
0	Weird???
16	In Appreciation of ENFJs	Hello ENFJs. I'm an ENFP. I just wanted to give a shout-out-appreciation-yell to all ya'll. I tend to be harsh on the XNFJ fam because my Ne-Fi is all about individualism and goddamnit don't tell me what to do even if it's the right thing! But in reality some of the best people I've known have been ENFJs. For example one of my best friends, who is always the one to organize fun stuff, and also is a wife and a kick-ass mother of two kiddos, and is also a nurse. Like, I'm single-with-no-kids-10-year-old-in-a-middle-aged-woman's-body and I just sit in awe as I watch her get all the shit done and then still be so warm and compassionate and thoughtful and fun to be with. Like it seriously baffles my mind. And I've known many like her over the years. So here's to you, keep on ENFJ-in it up and feel free to come say hi in r/ENFP if you ever feel like it. 
7	INFP here. :) I only know one ENFJ in my life (sad, I know). If there is one thing that I appreciate so much about him, it is that he is so good at uplifting people and making them feel loved. I sure hope everyone can be like that. Shoutout to all ENFJs ~ thank you for making life bearable, haha :) 
6	Thank you thank you thank you!\n\nYou guys are awesome too! You know how to fill up our emotional cups!
5	Being an enfj, I really appreciate this. Some days, it's hard to push through a hard day and keep a smile, but we know that bad days are like a cloud, they come and go! 
22	Hey, this is a bit random, but I love our widdle corner of the internet :)	Look at my flair for the whole story :P I'm busy a lot and don't drop by as often as I should, but when I do, it's like going to a good friend's house where I'm comfortable and I can just sit on the couch or lie on the floor and not say anything at all and that's okay. You're all beautiful, lovely people. I know that Autumn's coming, and that seems to be a really emotional season for many (self included); also school is starting which may bring some stress for many, but whatever reminiscences and melancholy may come, remember you've got your little corner of the interwebs here :)\n\nJust felt like saying that. Love you all <333
6	Hahahaha lying on the floor, the ultimate level of familiarity with someone.\n\nWell we are moving into Spring and towards summer holidays, so I guess the lesson is that there is no beginning or end to the circle of life, and just try to find happiness in each day.\n\nAlso sharing the love! 💖
6	sharing love is awesome! xD thanks for this post! life is great!
8	I need some advice from you people-people.	I'm a male INTP, and I got myself into an awkward social situation recently... (try to contain your shock.)\n\nSo I had a female acquaintance invite me over to her house this morning for a cup of tea. I interpreted this a sign of interest. She sat at one of the couch and I sat at the other. When she scooted closer to me, I took it as a hint and tried to put my arm around her. She got up within about a minute and said something along the lines of "I have to go soon..." that hint I got, and I excused myself.\n\nSo, here is my question, if I want to hang out with her again (as friends), do I apologize and say it won't happen again? Or do I just pretend like it never happened?
8	I'd be curious to hear other people's take as well.  Why should she scoot over if she had no intention of cuddling.\n\nDating can be so perplexing.
5	I would pretend that nothing happened and like it never happened. \n\nIt was already awkward having it happen, might make it even more awkward to have to bring it up and a possible discussion would ensue where now you're friend zoning yourself. \n\nJust don't ever make an attempt to be physical with her again, and observe whether she gives off body language that she's interested. \n\nI would apologize if I tried to kiss her or touch her leg or any touching that is more sexual in nature. Putting your arm around her is, of course, still physical but it can also be friendly. So what you did is not a big deal, just not the time. 
3	Probably apologize. It's weird though because she did scoot closer to you and it seems like a normal response to initiate.  Clear the air with her and just see how she's feeling.  
3	I'd apologize, it would be polite.\n\nMaybe she is into you, but then had 2nd thoughts. 
6	I need to stop drunk texting...	I have a serious problem with drunk texting guys I like and I'm wondering what I can do to stop it? I embarrass myself near weekly and it's driving me nuts.
6	infj here. I would ask yourself why you are doing it. Why are you texting them? What are you actually looking for? I could tell you to give your phone to a friend to prevent you from doing it, but that's really just a bandaid solution. If you get to the root of why maybe you'll be able to prevent the temptation to begin with. 
5	Turn your phone off.  Put it away.  Give it to a friend to hold on to.  Hide it from your drunk self.  \n\nThis doesn't really have anything to do with being an ENFJ, by the way.  
2	Honestly -- just commit to not doing it. I used to drunk text guys embarrassing shit all the time. (I've now gotten much more wholesome and just say things like "love you bye" but if it bothered me I wouldn't do it.) Although alcohol does alter your state of mind, i don't believe that you can forgo all of responsibility in this situation and just throw it on the liquor. I imagine the liquor is just bringing the truth out of you and you act on it.  
2	I used to run into this problem too especially with Snapchat and it's horrifying to not remember what all you said or how you embarrassed yourself. There is actually some apps that prevent you from drunk texting so I would look into those. 
1	Maybe unconsciously you want to do this , reach out , and alcohol is quite effective in lowering one's inhibitions.\n\nAre you normally shy when sober? \n\n\n

10	The Manipulative Side of the ENFJ	One of the top cons of our MBTI type is we're said to be manipulative. What are your "manipulation" stories? 
28	Everyone manipulates.\n\nTraditionally, to manipulate means to "handle or control in a skilful manner" — it was never meant to be a derogatory term.\n\nAll these constitute manipulation:\n\n* When a child cries to get her parents' attention\n\n* When you flirt with your boyfriend so he agrees to watching Mean Girls with you\n\n* When a boss gives you less than positive feedback to encourage you to work harder\n\n* When a guy tells you he thinks you guys have "a connection" so as to get you in bed...\n\nSo why are ENFJs stereotyped as the manipulators?\n\nBecause of our natural awareness of non-verbal cues, ENFJs are able to manipulate very successfully — and that's scary to others. Those who fail at manipulation, see example 4 above, are simply shelved to the "meh, shady" category. Our success is what makes our manipulation more obvious, more lethal.\n\nTo me, the line is drawn where such skill is misused to achieve selfish/ bad faith agendas.
5	I ask my boyfriend if he thinks it's cold in the bedroom so that he'll volunteer to give me his blanket. \n\nPure evil, I know. 
2	Help - I'm all over the place	I recently learned I'm an ENFJ-T. My LONG term relationship ended 7 months ago and I am now realizing how much I neglected my needs and wants to serve him. (I wanted to get married and travel) I also struggled with having friends and didn't realize at the time how depressed I was about this. So now I've identified things that I truly like and make me happy and have made a few friends.  I still don't go out as much as I would like but when I do it makes me very happy.  \n\nMy delimma: It's hard trying to focus on making myself happy because I miss having a companion. Some days I'm ok, some day I'm so lonely.\n\nIt seems that guys that come at me either are only interested in my looks and a physical relationship or they care about me so much they choose not to persue anything  because they can't meet my needs.  (Quality time, words of affirmation, commitment, and traveling) \n\nI've learned not to argue or put my needs aside so if that is their decision, I'm fine with it. I will not fight you to like/love me.\n\nI am obsessed with my feelings and talking about them. My best friend keeps telling me to stop obessing because it triggers my anxiety but it's so hard! I'm so freaking sensitive. \n\nPlease help my fellow ENFJs. 
2	Girl take a deep breath.\n\nYou need to keep yourself busy and meet new people. \n\nJoin clubs, find a hobby, take mediation/yoga classes. \nIf you don't have a job, maybe get one.\n\nKeeping yourself busy and meeting new people will def help! I promise!
1	If your open to this it has helped me tremendously and maybe it can for you \n\nhttp://skillsforawakening.com/teachings/the-pain-body/
1	This probably gets thrown around a lot, but have you thought about seeing a therapist? If you're feeling consumed by all these emotions it could be really helpful just to get them all out (in a safe place with someone who is trained to help). They can also help you plan how to reorganise your life so that when you do meet someone, you're in a good place for them too. Good energy attracts good energy, if that makes sense. Anyway, something to think about.
5	What is the 'N' in our personality ?	I really do not understand the iNtuitive part of my personality, can you explain to me how it effects your personality ?
10	As a Ni dom, I really focus on patterns and interconnectedness. Nothing ever happens in a vacuum for me. Causation and similarities are always present at the forefront of my mind, And being able to recognize these patterns leads m.y decision making.\n\nI'm always looking for the "most accurate" truth, or the most plausible.  In tandem with aux Fe, I prioritize the comfort and harmony and joy of others with my insight. I'm always thinking, ok, Anne's room is filled with sketchbooks and paper, and that one time she casually mentioned she's trying watercolour, so if I get her a watercolour set, it'd probably make her happy. *this is Ni-Se in tandem, drawing conclusions via Ni by examining concrete physical evidence via Se.\n\nIf you're an enfj, you might go the other way. I want to make Anne happy, but how? Hmm, maybe I can get some clues by looking at her room or her Instagram or her Pinterest.  Ok, now that I've investigated, I'm going to get her a watercolour set because I've got a good feeling she'd like it.  So you have Fe giving the order, and Ni-Se working together to investigate and draw conclusions.  
5	The Intuition part of our personality is central to so many ENFJ classic qualities and traits. As people who gain energy and happiness from connecting (F) with other people (E) and who prefer organization and structure in the way that we think and plan (J), having Intuition as a dominant trait ties all those things together. \n\nFor example, for me, it feels like my mind is always *on*. Like I can't just watch a TV show to enjoy good TV, I'm constantly analyzing why the characters are doing the things the way that they do them and trying to draw connections. In my personal relationships, in most face-to-face conversations, I can feel my eyes constantly darting and analyzing the person who I'm talking to. Did they lean back? Did they lean forward? Are they mimicking my body language? What nonverbal cues are they giving me? 
4	My father is ENFJ as me!	Do you think genetics play a role in our personality? Yesterday I discovered that my father have the same personality as me, is it coincidence or inheritance ? 🤔
6	I definitely think it is a combination of genetics and if you grow up with them they help shape your personality.
4	I read an article once where it said that personality is  about 50% inherited. Can't locate it tho, only to say really that some researches have some empirical data to at least theorize this. 
3	I would say we typically start out with genetic predispositions to behavior that are informed by what's deemed normal behavior by our family and our attachment with said family members. \n\nI'm an ENFJ (oldest child in caretaker role at an early age) - father is an ENFP and mother was likely INFJ/INFP - brother/middle child is ESTJ, ostracized a lot and hung out more with family friends - youngest sibling/sister is ENFP, who had the most interaction with my father and his personality growing up and was the only child who my father treated much like he was treated growing up (allowed to do whatever, but not given much emotional connection). My grandmother (closest family member, we had a lot of common ground growing up) is an ENFJ as well. Both her daughters reacted to her extroversion with introversion. Exciting stuff. 
2	My dad is ISTP and mom is ESFJ. I guess it works since i'm the same cognitive stack as my dad and same dominant function as my mom.
1	What should i talk about with my new enfj friend?	I'm INTJ, m, and I've been in situations where I wanted to get closer to an ENFJ friend but I feel like I'm boring her with talk about classes recently. Maybe I need to be more exciting? Any advice is good. 
5	talk about your interests, passions, and ask her about life.  Conversation about feelings and ideals is a good way to go.\n\nTrying to make yourself more exciting might go against your personality, it's just better to discuss things that come naturally to you.\n\nAny sort of ship, even forming friendships, requires sincerity if you want an ENFJ to grow closer to you.  The fact that you guys chat quite a bit shows her interest in you as a friend.  I know personally, I wouldn't go out of my way to maintain a conversation I have no interest in.
2	Hello! True blue ENFJ here. My best friend of years and years is a hardcore INTJ, and I know a few others.\n \nThe thing about INTJs that annoys me the most is that I think some of them are overly self-assured? To the point where it's a fault, and I'm not interested in giving advice to anyone who is dismissive because they think they already know. The efficiency that INTJs tend to prioritize can really hurt when an ENFJ just needs you to be there. It isn't always about the solution. Sometimes it's just the sentiment of listening and caring that helps much more.\n\nOne time I remember talking to my INTJ and INTP friends, and I was saying something about how, if I ever someone needs helps or they're struggling, I just can't ignore it; I have to do what I can for them. Else I feel really wrong. Someone has to anyways, right? Someone has to, and I think it's an ENFJ thing to continually make yourself that "someone". Anyways, my friends looked at each other like they had noooooo clue what I was talking about. They literally couldn't understand that feeling. Stuff like that really made me recognize our differences. I don't know if this was helpful, but I hope it gave you some insight!\n\nGood luck!! I hope your days are happy.    
1	Why don't you ask her questions and get her talking about things she's interested in, what she likes, values or believes in. \n\nYou'll then get an idea of things she would want to talk about. Talk about those. \n\n
1	We love to talk...we love to talk about anything lol
4	Introvert behavior !!	Hey! I am ENFJ all of my life! but from time to time I feel like shut down all people and stay alone! that makes me feel depressed because people give me energy! but also people confuse me because I like to understand all people. When I can not understand and fail to anticipate their behavior I feel stressed about it! Any advise? 
3	I do this sometimes. Some people get overwhelmed more easily than others, so sometimes we shut people out temporarily in search of peace and quiet. The majority of the time, others don’t notice this behaviour, so don’t be afraid or worried about coming off the wrong way.
3	I'm somewhat the same way. I love being around people, like to keep busy, and need others energy. After having a hectic or busy day, I like to come home, spend an hour or two alone to re charge. \nIf I don't interact with others, I get depressed. If o don't get my down time, I get worn out. There is a healthy balance between the two. 
8	ENFJs: Do you know your Enneagram number/type? If so, what is it?	I had a hard time narrowing mine down (I was torn between 2, 9, and 4), but I've come to the conclusion that I'm a 4w3. What's yours? 
6	9w1 here. Glad there's a record for my personality type, since I've grown to feel like an outlier in present company, and can't wait until I move out
6	3w2, sometimes 2w3
4	2w3. I think, still working it out. 
3	3w4
3	2w1,  Tritype is 269 just because why not :) 
3	4w5! A weirdly very introverted type for an extrovert lol...but i guess enneagram is more about the drive anyway :)
3	I'm a 4w3, tritype 468 - the truth teller. 4's are typically more introverted but with a w3 considered more extroverted. Also I feel like when I heard the description of my tritype it lined up well with what characteristics make up an ENFJ.
2	I used to be a 6w7 while I was living with awful housemates, but I just took a [quiz](https://www.eclecticenergies.com/enneagram/test.php) and I'm 9w1, which is much more accurate to my baseline.
2	2w3. Tritype is 278!
2	Stupid question: how do you find your enneagram number? 
2	2w3 with a tri-type of 279. 
2	9 here. According to this article, we are 1.92% of ENFJs out there https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2016/01/mbti-and-the-enneagram-2/15/
2	9w1!
10	I'm tired of being alone. So many people flirt with me, but no one ever gets closer to me.	Hopefully someone can relate and can help shed some light maybe on what has helped them find a partner?\n\nI'm a early-30's woman who is very positive, very friendly and outgoing, funny, I have my life together (great career, great apartment, good with finances), upbeat, I'm engaging with people and like to make others feel heard and cared about... I feel like I'm [decently attractive](http://imgur.com/a/R9Ga2) and a good person. So I don't really understand why I haven't had any guys interested in me enough to make a move on me or tell me that they're interested in the last few years (I've been single for about 2 years now). I will admit that I do not like making the first move on someone, because it's EXCLUSIVELY how I've ended up dating people, by me making a move on them. I've never dated or been with someone who went after me -- it's always been me going after them. And for the past couple of years I've put my foot down and decided not to pursue any guys but let them pursue me. But I'm starting to get frustrated. I feel VERY happy and content in my life. I love my life. But I do wish I could share my life with someone. I am the type of person who has a lot of love to give and I'd love to feel that back from someone. I'm not looking for something casual - I want something great.\n\nSo what has worked with you ENFJ's in dating and finding your love?
7	I don't think it's a good idea to just *decide* on not to pursue anyone. As a guy and as an intp, I very much like appreciate it when people are direct with me. The chances are, there are people who would like to be with you, but they feel like they are not good enough for you. I say this considering the fact that you have your life together and you seem really happy.\n\nYou say you've exclusively started dating people in the past because you initiated them and you've been with people who you cared for deeply. So to me, it sounds like you're trying to change a strategy that's worked well so far which doesn't make a lot of sense to me. I say, if there is someone you like, just pursue them. I wish I could do more of that myself.\n\nI have to say this as well. I understand you want to be pursued, because it makes you feel wanted and valued. But once you're with the right person, I don't think it will matter how you've met or who pursued whom. You just need to make sure that the person you are with appreciates you and makes you feel appreciated.\n\nIn short, I say do not wait, pursue whomever you're interested in.\n\nPS: My current ENFJ gf was the one who pursued me, just so you know. And I love that girl to bits.
6	You sound like you've been hurt in the past by your ex's and you are blaming it on the fact that you were the one who initiated those relationships. Stop doing that. Doing this you're saying that it's your fault, for being who you are. You just haven't met your ideal partner, or couldn't make it work because of communication issues, but you should NEVER take responsability for being who you are. I'm quoting someone on reddit not so much ago: "You have to dislike lots of people for being who you are, but theres another bunch who LOVES and would love to be with you, being you, and not this fake ENFJ waiting for someone to make the first move..." ok, I added a little bit to the quote. Come on, we are the initiators, because our personality makes everyone else unsure if we want to be with them because we are kind with everyone. You are strong, pretty, loving and have a great life, it's normal to make others affraid to initiate something with you. Stop being a pussy and initiate.
3	I like to take opportunity when I want it.  So whether it's the guy pursuing me or vice versa.  Not sure if you've tried online dating and letting guys initiate conversation, because that's what they will do.\n\nMy current relationship was from me initiating conversation with my bf.  When we met, we talked about friendships, past relationships etc. Initially I asked him if we could do lunch, and later on in our conversation, he asked if we can make it into a dinner date.  From then on out, things have been great.  I'm not sure how you put yourself out there.  Like, I don't attend a lot of social events as much as I did when I was in college.  I just happened to run into my bf right after I moved back home from college.  
3	To be honest, the only person stopping you from getting into great relationships here, is yourself. \n\nWhy does it matter who the pursuer is? Do you doubt a relationship if you were the pursuer?\n\nI am meant to be a pursuer and I fully embrace it. Today I am the happiest I have ever been in my relationship(s). I don't think I would get anywhere if I deliberately stopped myself from being who I am and doing what I do best. I will not wait for who or what I want to fall at my feet; I will just go out and get it!
2	I'm just dropping in to tell you you're pretty ❤
1	For me I was the initiator in my last relationship but I get hurt, so now it is hard for me to pursue or hold on anyone!\nBut if you feel like you can do it, do not hold yourself back.
1	The truth is that not everyone gets to marry and be happy every after. Many die young, others die virgins in their 80s, still others are not destined to be in a happy relationship because of a variety of "circumstances". That being said, as a believer in God, I do have a hopeful outlook on life where justice and goodness will ultimately prevail. My time comes if and when it is supposed to come, even if that may not be in this lifetime.
3	Enfj dating intj	Hey r/enfj, \n\nI need some advice, last month I matched with this awesome intj girl on Bumble. I was really excited to meet her, we had a great date. Tacos, Art museum, walked in the park, quick drink then comedy show. We talked almost non stop, not just surface level stuff but all the things you're not supposed to talk about on the first date. Pretty much everything she said piqued my interests and made me more attracted to her. Also, when she's thinking she has this look on her face that almost shows the gears turning inside her head, it was amazing to me. She really checked a lot of boxes for me. We set up another date and left it at that. \n\nUnfortunately, she had to cancel due to "something happening" and her realizing she wasn't ready to date yet. Obviously I was super bummed but told her I hope everything was OK and if she ever needed anything to let me know. \n\nIn the weeks after I made a plan to say happy birthday in a month and try and reconnect then. Well I did exactly that. Said happy birthday, then waited a day to catch up and see how she was doing. Good conversation, then I said "I'd been thinking about her recently and would really like to see her again." she agreed and said we should get together soon. I was elated!  \n\nSo I guess my question is, how do I handle this second date? I want it to go well. Obviously don't want to scare her away. It's weird I'm not really this nervous about this kinda thing, but I really want this to work out. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!
5	I'm an ENFJ dating an INTJ. I've done so much research on them as well so here's my two cents. \n\nTake it easy. INTJs are super flighty when it comes to emotions that they're not ready to process. They generally don't know how to handle strong display of emotions, especially in public when they're not ready. \n\nSo for the second date, keep it casual. Let the conversation flow, but do not bring up the topic of relationship just yet. My guess is that she's very cautious about entering a relationship/dating. Keep your conversations light, focus on interests, and have fun :) \n\nJust make a comfortable space for her and let her enter that space on her own time. Give her tonnes of space (eg do not incessantly text). \n\nPatience is the ultimate key in dating INTJs. 
4	Aw how sweet! My INTJ bf and I are absolutely in love.\n\nWe started off as friends, became best friends, and are now dating but the attraction was always there. Haha, I'm about to go of far on a tangent.\n\nI suggest having discussions about topics that are important to you. Be yourself but be open to this, be brave in debates, don't be afraid of conflict because it's not personal. My INTJ and I are constantly discussing music and philosophy and whenever we disagree we duke it out, respectfully of course. The goal is to get to the truth, ya know? Not to be right or wrong. \n\nKeep it light with emotional stuff by get heavy with intellectual topics and analyzing that! \n\nMy INTJ actually helped me learn to stop hiding my emotions all the time and I was the less emotional one... Rare case, I know haha. Even he says so! For instance, he said I love you first but only because I started saying it but instantly began stalling. He then told me he knew I loved him for months but didn't want want scare me off. \n\nBasically be like him with this girl haha. Best wishes! 
3	Treat it like a forest creature that is easily spooked. 
2	Can OP please update on how the second date went. I like stories. 
7	enfj and creativity?	ok soenfjs tend to be very charismatic,but i also noticed very artistic.when they express this creativity its so cool,its liek poetry,so what kinds of creative things do you guys enjoy doing?
3	Writing poetry,drawing and painting,making things out of wood...its like meditation for me
2	I enjoy playing music (drums and guitar) and surfing, both of which are great platforms for creative expression.
2	actor, who does fake fighting and plays guitar and sings and occasionally also do stuff behind the camera. :) i used to do a lot of pencil drawing but it didn't stick.\n\nedit: oh, i also write.
2	I don't draw or paint. I could never figure out how to play guitar. But I sing, I act, I look like a newborn giraffe when I dance, and my main creative outlet is photography. And I love it. 
2	I sing and play piano and guitar. I also love to read and write :)
2	How important is it that those close to you can hang with your ginormous and varied groups of friends?	If you are close to an ENFJ, and happen to be an introvert, how much of a problem is it if you can't keep up with their social life? How important is it that you can keep up with their 47 different friend groups and their jam-packed social calendars?
6	not that important. I have several groups I hang out with now and then, but one group I main with.  That main group consists of my major besty and then my lower tier besties.
3	I only blend my favourite people with my various friend groups. Otherwise I keep them separate. It's a part of wanting to show that favourite person all the aspects of my life.\n\nIf you don't like it let him know. No point keeping it in just so you wouldn't hurt/ offend him.
1	I'm a major ENFJ socialite and my boyfriend is a major introvert, just have an honest discussion about how you get your energy from recharging and that you need periodic breaks. I used to completely overwhelm my poor boyfriend before we had a fantastic talk where we learned to start paying attention to our socializing / introverted time spent, so that neither us is unhappy. 
1	I'm an INFJ, and I made a new friend, who happens to be ENFJ. Before this I thought I was quite extroverted for an INFJ, and was quite proud of my social skills. But the ENFJ is something out of this world! The 47 different friend groups, is not an exagerration! Even the one time he promised us it was going to be 'just us' tonight, one of his friends just randomly turned up to his house and joined in our game night. I realised that I should have expected this, knowing MBTI, but they truly are ridiculously social beyond belief, and I'm handling it by going to game nights less and less now. My ENFJ doesn't seem happy about it, but I realise that I can't make him change himself, or reject his other friends, just for me. Thus, ENFJ gets rejected XD
5	anyone else attracted to ENFPs?	I've noticed a lot of my friends (if not INFPs) seem to be ENFPs. (some of them have been really manipulative though but that's probably a different problem all together lol). One of my first friends I met in 5th grade is ENFP and we're still good friends now. My past relationship was also with an ENFP, who I didn't find out was one until I had her take a test haha.\n\nMaybe it has to do with my mom being an ENFP? IDK, it just seems like a lot of people I like or people who lure me in are ENFPs.
7	I love ENFPs. My sister and I are super close, and she's an ENFP, and a lot of my exes have been. My problem with them dating-wise is that they tend to be fairly commitment avoidant, or slow to it, and in immaturity that can lead to being ghosted or pushed away in really unkind ways. But that's an INFP thing too, and my best relationships have been with INFPs. \n\n*my experience*
4	Me~~ Very emotionally supportive creatures.\n\nThey like my having structured goals, I like their sense of adventure and freedom 😆
4	ENFPs are enchanting. My apologies, I know I'm not an ENFJ, not even remotely. At 1000 yards, I would not be confused for an ENFJ. I'm just chiming in here for an excuse to say: I love your (ENFJ) subreddit! There is such a nice vibe to the posts here. Plus, I get a little pick-me-up from the positive messages that float up when I up-vote a post here. Sorry if I may be artificially inflating some of your post ranks as a form of self-medication. ;)
3	no, irresponsible, and very prone to construct on opposing reality fast.  most ENFP girls i know went from 100% to 0-5% in relation to their loved ones
3	One of my good friends is ENFP! We have an amazing friendship and great communication. Always puts a smile on my face! 
1	My boyfriend is an ENFP. I always dated xNTJs before and found myself depressed because things felt one sided. This is the first time I've felt healthy love and feel understood. His scatterbrained nature, though annoying at times, is something I secretly like (I like to lead in some areas). He's hilarious, thoughtful, understanding, and never fails to make me feel loved. Everyone I know loves him. They never stop talking about what a sweetheart he is! I will say that past friends of mine who were ENFPs (girls) were always super sweet and bubbly but I found that they were still immature and learning. Of course that was back in high school. My boyfriend is matured and really well balanced. I know growing up he was a bit of a trouble maker though. \nI truly think ENFPs are very very compatible with ENFJs if both are balanced and matured. 
1	Two of my best friends are ENFPs and so is my life partner of two years who is everything to me. \n\nWhile I don't always understand their complete lack of structure I so love their energy and adventurousness. Always up for whatever you throw at them, eager to come with great ideas of their own, and as long as they get a little help with following up on their ideas also great teammates. When it comes to commitment I have never had any problem with that. I have never had any reason to not trust any of these persons in a time of need. If I need them they are there, just like I would be for them. I think the most important thing for ENFPs is that for them to share anything with you the interest has to be mutual, otherwise they will look for other distractions. \n\nThey can of course be a real pain in the ass when they are down in the dumps but who isn't? All they really need is a shoulder to cry on, a pillow to scream in or a wall to punch. \n\nWhat more can I say? I wish there were more ENFPs in the world.
5	Sad over the loss of closest Friend... please help :(	So, a long time ago (several years), I met this girl (ENFP) and we instantly connected. First girl i talked to in middle school (we're both now on 12th, so around 6 years). We had our other group of friends who we were really close too. Of course some separated because that happens at that age, but there were some who stayed, let's call them Frank and Charlie (not real names).\n\nDuring high school, we made lots of new friends who stayed for the first 2 years. I always became closer and closer to this girl. She was the first one I could really trust with my closest problems, and I was the ONLY one she ever really opened up to. She told me about her problems during the last years, how her father left them when she was young and forced her mother on a really bad situation, how her mother (amazing woman imo) got affected by trying so hard, that sometimes she could be overboard. How she (the girl) was bulimic for a while and her self-steem was extremely low even if she didn't show it... We (the 2 of us) would be the only ones that, in her words, could laugh together about anything and instantly cheer each other up, as well as always stay together through the worst. Whenever I was with her during the last 2 years, I felt an extreme amount of "care" and this weird happiness that I cant really explain, but I just wanted to make sure she was happy. It was never really romantic attraction since I've felt that with other girls and it's different, this is something completely new honestly. She told me multiple times how she didn't want our relationship to end because of one stupid fight, but she knew it wouldn't.\n\nFast forward to Aug 2016. She had a boyfriend, great guy. She always had a problem (had to do with her low self steem) where she kind of 'took on' several personality traits of her current bf, as her bfs never really 'complimented' her on her qualities and stuff since they were fine with this (she even told me she realized that too after the break ups). He was a great dude, dont get me wrong. A new guy entered our school, let's call him Peter. Peter is extremely shy and insecure, a bit offputting sometimes but I didn't judge him based on anything, and tried to be his friend.\n\nPeter became her bf's best friend. I tried to be Peter's friend since was always really close to her, and i wanted to know what was up. My other 2 friends saw on his laptop, week 1, around 100 photos downloaded of her. Found out he ( Peter) stalked her on ask before entering school with anonymous comments like "great ass" "love of my life" (never met her before that)  and changed schools for her. He got EXTREMELY nervous when he talked to her friends (us). Well, he became her bf's best friend to spread hearsay that he cheated on her. Yep, dick move.\n\nMe and ALL of her friends were worried about this dude in december. Told her about it but she wouldnt listen. We said for about 2 days that we didnt care if we had to manipulate her or something to avoid her getting hurt bad, but 2 days later without even doing anything I said that I wouldnt do it, i cared about her way too much too do something like that.\n\nPeter was extremely jealous, like really jealous. Fast forward to Feb this year. Spread hearsay about me saying I had been manipulating her from December onwards (even though I didnt, literally said I wouldn't do that). She didnt believe him at first, but talked to him every class (they were in same class) about this for about a month, they were already a couple. One day, she just broke down. Was crying to me saying she didnt want to even discuss the topic, that it hurt because it was me and didn't want to talk to us again. I did everything, tried to explain on thousands of ways, told her how much I care about her, wrote her a letter, etc...\n\nShe stopped talking to ALL of her friends and basically only talked to Peter now. 6 months later, and we share every class. My last year, and I want to study uni abroad. Remember how she changed with her couples? With him, since he's really insecure, there was no problem on his end. She went from being the happy girl who always talked to everyone, to being reserved most of the time. She had always solved earlier problems, bu was suddenly closed minded about hearsay. The 3 of us are on the same class, our (around 10 people) group of friends lost her basically. Now, in class, knowing this might be the last year in the country, im extremely devastated and afraid that I'll never fix this... I would usually be extremely happy about being with her, but I'm so damn sad...I still care about her the same way as before, never changed. I just want to be with her again, and her to be safe, because, coupled with her self steem issues, if she ever breaks up and realizes she doesn't talk to any of her friends anymore, might be devastating for her... and I'm truly worried. I know she's hurting because of how she reacts to the topic... I'm honestly desperate at tbis point, and I'm never like this, usually get over stuff pretty fast.\n\nSORRY for long post\n\nTLDR: really close to best friend for 6 years. New, stalker and insecure bf spreads hearsay about all of us. Stopped talking to all of her friends, I'm really worried. \n\nEDIT: spelling mistakes cuz phone 
5	* You are all incredibly young and this sounds like typical high school drama.\n\n* If your account or the story is completely objective, Peter does sound like a manipulative, abusive fucking dick. To me, isolating your significant other from his or her friends is the number one biggest fucking red flag of a toxic relationship.\n\n* Unfortunately, regardless, you can't save who does not want to be saved.\n\n* You can't force someone to see what they don't want to see.\n\n* You can only tell her you will always be here for her when she is ready. She might leave Peter and "become her normal self again" - good for everyone. She might also never leave Peter - are you going to wait forever.\n\n* Young ENFJs tend to have this "hero complex". I've been there before. Save yourself the heartache and trouble, dear one.\n\nThis might also help: https://www.reddit.com/r/enfj/comments/6syfia/enfj_advice_for_getting_over_a_lost_friend/
1	I also basically never look sad... I'm usually energetic and talkative  and get over stuff quickly. Today lots of people said they noticed me looking really down, and I don't like giving that impression honestly... and I know i really shouldn't care about that...
3	ENFJ motivation	What do you, fellow ENFJs, do to motive yourself to stay true to who you are? It can be hard to wear your heart on your sleeve and be such hard workers when the world doesn't undertsand us! \n\nPersonally I watch New Girl or Parks and Rec. 
6	I write music. It helps keep me in touch with myself and not get overwhelmed by all the emotions and energies of others. Frankly, my motivation has been in the form of prioritizing my needs and setting hard professions boundaries (but that's because I'm a therapist and I struggle with my own depression if I feel unvalued). The more I feel taken care of the less I feel burned out. And when it comes down to it, no one is really going to take care of my needs like me. 
3	I watch animes with heroes being true to themselves. Boku no hero, Tengen toppa, comes to my mind ;D
3	I personally can't stand liars or people with "fake" personalities. I usually see right through their bs. With that said, I try my best to be true to myself. I don't like to be around people who don't want me to. I love to surround myself with others who genuinely like me and I have a connection with them. \n\nI also feel, we give up a lot for others and can never leave anytime for ourselves. ( I usually have class 5 days a week and then work the remaining 2 days at my internship.) I try to give an hour or 2 to myself to unwind a relax each day. Whenever I did have an actual day off, my friends would be like "let's hang out or let's go somewhere etc" it's hard, but I put my foot down and let them know this is my day to relax lol. This semester I scheduled my classes to 4 days a week and work 2 days a week. This way I have a whole/part of a day all to myself! 
2	I try to avoid people who it is obvoius wouldn't understand me. I have learned that a piece of good advice can easily be seen as judgemental (as a kid everyone called me a besserwisser), so I make sure to only give advice to those who ask for it. If people want my opinion on anything I happily help, but if not I more and more often choose to let people repeat their own mistakes until they learn by themselves. \n\nThis can go too far sometimes, as for example in a group discussion no one will ask specifically for my advice over anyone elses, so it's a bit of a double-edged sword. Balance is key in the end, and life is all about learning to maintain it.
3	TSwift for me 
10	How do you respond to "i hope this isn't weird for you" when someone is opening up about something personal?	I was talking to a person that I have met two weeks ago. A really nice person, we really clicked (friendship-wise).\n\nWe talked about different things and at some point in our conversation we went quite in depth about the recent death of his mother.\n\nWhen we were on this topic, he told me "I hope this isn't weird for you or anything". I've noticed that this is often said when I meet new people and they open up about a personal issue.\n\nI usually answer: "It isn't, I appreciate you trusting me enough to tell me this", but I feel like it seems a bit tryhard. I never know what to confidently answer.\n\n I'm trying to convey the fact that him being able to talk to me about these things means the world to me. It makes me feel validated and appreciated. I want him to understand that to me, these are the moments when an acquaintance blooms into a friendship.\n\nCan anyone relate?
9	I feel like it's such an enfj thing to worry about how empathetic our responses are. Lol He's probably happy with your responses as is, or he wouldn't feel comfortable telling you personal things. 
6	I'll say "I'm honored !" Or just explain that I truly enjoy getting to know people and how fascinating I think they are.
4	I think your response is definitely one that wouldn't be construed as try hard. It's hard to open up and halfway through it sometimes people feel like they are burdening you with information you could care less about or that makes you feel weird and uncomfortable around them. Just validating that you actually care and appreciate their openness seems like it should suffice and be appreciated :)
2	I think that's a very thoughtful way of expressing exactly what you mean to say. Do people know you as someone who is careful to about phrasing things the way (s)he means to? If so, then it shouldn't feel out of place to another thoughtful person. 
2	I absolutely think you put it in a good way. I usually go "oh not at all, please don't worry about that" or "I appreciate you sharing with me, no worries I promise" or something to that effect. You're good, I don't think you should worry ha. 
2	People open up to me so easily with personal stuff! I make sure to listen and ask questions (so they know I'm listening) and just give reassuring words that I genuinely mean. \n\nAs others have mentioned, I also look back and think, omigosh, I could have comforted them this way, which prob would have made them feel better. Etc 
2	I do the same as you, but take things at face value. Overthinking/worry is an improper use of our imagination.
2	I think the answer isn't tryhard. If you want something more subtle, maybe just go, "please, go right ahead!" or something.
2	Body language is wayyyyyy more important than the actual words in this kind of situation. If you smile at them and look like you're really okay with it, it doesn't matter what kind of crap comes out of your mouth.
1	I generally say "Pfffftttt, no big deal", make a waving away gesture, and then follow-up with a question to get back on topic. \n\nMost of the time the person isn't even paying attention to my response. They're just expressing their self-consciousness out loud and they feel better as soon as the words are out of their mouth, before I even say anything.
7	(Lack of) Verbal affirmation	I'm not ENFJ, but you guys usually have good insights. Anyway, I got a new job and at first, I got lots of verbal affirmation, which I never really got before. Which was great. Till I didn't get much of it anymore. Or till I got criticism. Anyway, now if I don't get affirmation, I felt very crushed, like everyone hates me and I'm doing everything wrong. As I've read you guys are also onto verbal affirmation, how do you deal with the lack of it? Or with criticism? 
6	First off I got a good chuckle from your username so thank you for that!\n\nSecond, I do agree that most ENFJs or high Fe users do thrive on words of affirmation, be it in a work situation or romantically, there's just something so comforting and encouraging hearing that people notice or appreciate something you've done! I can see why this might come off as attention seeking, but I genuinely believe we don't enjoy hearing compliments or whatever as an ego boost, but as a source of comfort or encouraging point in the right direction. \n\nI think we can end up relying too much on those words, I often find myself asking close friends many different things just to get feedback, particularly when stressed or lacking confidence. For lack of words of affirmation or criticism, I learned that not everyone uses this method to show their appreciation, or can sometimes come across as particularly harsh with their criticism, even if they have the best intentions. So I've basically learned not to always seek reaffirmation from people as I can be too dependent on it, and that everyone shows appreciation differently and not to take criticism to heart as much and focus on fixing said criticism :) 
6	Maybe you have raised the bar of expectations due to the excellent work you do. Then even excellent work becomes the norm (people usually don't praise the norm) and small mistakes get exagerated. \n\nI too have a tendency to feel unappreciated without verbal affirmation, but I'd rather have no affirmation that than receive criticisms. With criticisms, I first check who gives it and why. If it is something I can change in me, then I address the issue. If it's nothing I can change and the criticisms are stemming from personal biases, I just accept them but don't dwell on them, and avoid having to deal with that person as much as possible.
3	fe and fi?	ok enfjs are realy kind people,to and genuily want to help people even at the expensive of themselfs even more so than nfps,but its just they way fe seems to me seems a bit shallow,since im an infp maby i ahev very deep values?,but it seems like enfjs or esfj fe doms tend 'seem' im not sure if this is correct but help poeple in the moment just because its sappose to be done in the moment?like it seems like there's this helping you but the help is not comming from the side but the outside?,like as an infp see someone in need of help,i miht feel some pain,analyze the situation and help wer enessacary,but fe doms seem to help people,by not feeling itside themselfs but just 'because; will help people 
10	I don't think it's more shallow. It's just different. Fe has empathy just as much as Fi, but it's different. They directly FEEL people's emotions. I've had moment in my life where I'm suddenly feeling sad (because of whatever thoughts I had) where some ENFJ I knew turned to look at me right when I'm feeling it. Like they just felt it as well. I'm not Fe dom though, so I can't tell for sure. \n\nFi on the other hand, projects what they would feel. 'If I was you, I would feel that in this context, and I would wish you would do that for me, so that's what I would do'. It's also more individualist by nature, both because of values it involves and because it's based on personal feelings. Also, Fi it's a lot about self. Fi doms have values and feel bad about themselves if they don't respect them. It can also seems shallow to help others just to feel good about yourself. 
3	Yep you pretty much nailed it, I think most Fe doms just do whatever is right or whatever is best for the group since we love that harmony shiz. Obviously it can depend on the situation, plus always putting others before yourself isn't healthy if it's something you really don't want to do. Like you said Fi doms tend to hang back a bit and analyse or see how a situation effects them/ their morals from my experience :)
2	ENFJs and INFJs are often the baker of cookies, the giver of hugs, and so on, for they do not know how to make things better that are complicated.  **This is a sterotype** *because there are so many exceptions to the rules* but that is the first instinct of many ENFJs and INFJs, make a person feel safe, and somehow providence will work this all out.  Fe organizes towards Harmony.\n\n* Now ENFJs and INFJs can do far more constructive things besides hugs and feeling safe but it requires to the ENFJ / INFJ to breathe, to relax, and via breathing they are able to access the deeper thoughts involved with feeling.  As a metaphor, an EMT / Ambulance Tech may put a shock blanket around you while then after that is done spend the time to make sure there are no more internal injuries **that are not obvious on the surface** via asking questions and doing medical tests and so on.\n\nFi operates differently, Fi is based around Authenticity and thus it wants to grapple those hard problems, but sometimes Fi without enough Fe to balance it comes across as harsh.  Think of Fi as the doctors who perform surgery.  Surgery saves lives, but without anesthetic to knock the person out, and pain pills / morphine, etc surgery can kill someone due to SHOCK even if you get rid of the underlying problem such as a tumor, bullet wound, etc.\n\n----\n\nAll human beings use both Fe and Fi, for all human beings use all 8 jungian functions.  We find it easier to use 4 of these functions and we say we can consciously access them, the other 4 functions are part of our shadow and we use them all the time but it feels more accidental, less precise, and we can't use them effectively during moments of stress and high arousal.  But via modifying your breathing, or being in a nonstressful enviroment, or certain styles of meditation we find it easier to access the other style of Feeling whether Fe or Fi to compliment our default style.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe need both Fe and Fi to thrive both as individuals but also as a society.  It is the combination of Fe and Fi that allow humans and a half a dozen other species to be able to **cooperate and work together with other people of our species that we are not genetically related to as one tribe.  Aka we are not brothers, sisters, clones, or cousins, but we can be very distantly related or not at all but we still form unified groups with strangers in order to work cooperatively to the betterment of all.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo lets go back to the sterotype of ENFJs as the baker of cookies, and the giver of hugs, and so on.  The cookie (Fe) may not fix the underlying problem but it may put the other person at ease and show that this is a safe space and you can trust the people here, and it is okay to open up with Fi and to share.\n\nAka the Fe may be the first step in a longer journey that ends up with Fi sharing but both people need to feel at ease and safe.  So understand the world needs ENFJs and INFJs just like it needs INFPs and ENFPs.  Same thing with the other 12 types.
5	Survey for ENFJs about Movies	Hello everyone! I'm an ENFP writer and I'd like some assistance with an article I may write in the future. I am curious about whether or not individuals in each Myers-Briggs type have similar movie preferences, so I figured I'd find out for myself. If anyone is interested in participating, I'd love to hear about your top 3-5 films, and you can even add a short description on why you chose them, if you'd like.\n\nI'm excited to hear your possible responses. Thanks in advance. Have fun!!
6	Inception. Love time bending, and lucid behaviors.\n\nInglorious Bastards. Tarantino has a great flair for exploiting an actor's relentless dark side, meanwhile showcasing it through a comedic trope. \n\nJumanji. RIP, Robin. I fell in love with his acting when I was young and came across (what later turned out to be) his coke induced rant over wearing bananas in your shoe, to prove if the shoe was alive. This aired on Sesame Street.\n \nThe Mask. I wanted to grow up to be Cameron Diaz's character; and kinda did. Any guy who can enjoy Jim Carrey or gives off a sense of whimsy makes me swoon.\n \nAcross the Universe. My favorite movie-musical. The technical aspects astounded me, and I later worked in one of the costume houses which did some of the more grandiose costumes. The blue people in Eddy Izzard's sequence are made of paper mache, exp. ;) 
5	[deleted]
3	1- Inception (Like @katmarie123, I really enjoyed this time bending movie. I had to watch this a few times to really understand it. With each rewatch, I was able to appreciate the minute details that I didn't catch previously. All Christopher Nolan movies are amazing. "Doctor Strange" and "Get Out" were also great movies that I got a similar feel, even though they are completely different. If that makes any sense)\n\n2- Spirited Away (I watched this while I was in elementary school. I've watched it once more maybe a year ago which I really regret. Why I regret it is because the pure memories of just watching it as a young child compared to now is just completely different. In the sense that I interpreted things more compared to the innocence of just watching it without much thought to it)\n\n3- Good Will Hunting (First of all, RIP Robin Williams. Today is 3 years since his passing. For this movie, the story line was great, but not amazing, however really really good. What I did find amazing, though, was the authencity and wisdom of Robin in this movie while working with the cocky genius. One of the most powerful scenes I've taken from this, and I would recommend you to take a look, is the genuineness Robin portrays in "You're just a kid" scene. Just look it right up on YouTube and I hope you will understand what I mean. Other than that, all Robin movies are amazing, no matter what the critics say you can pick a beautiful quote/scene from it. My next favorite Robin movie is Dead Poets Society)\n\n4- The Imitation Game (This one, I was really taken by the theme of passion and grit. When everyone gives up on you, but you do whatever you can to keep pushing. To me, it was more of a motivational movie. If really shows the power of passion and the destruction of obsession which I found both  fascinating. The personal story of why he was so obsessed was also like a "ohhh so that's why he's like this" and added a touch to the movie)\n\n5- A Beautiful Mind (Don't want to tell spoilers, but the pivot point in this movie was amazing. It makes you realize things from a different perspective that not everything is how YOU view things and that there are special people in the world who see things completely different. Great plot. I'm afraid I'm ranting now and will leave it at that)\n\nThese are definitely not limited to my favorites. I'm sure that there are movies that would top one on the list that I can't think of on the top of my head. One thing I just noticed is that a lot of these movies are more thought provoking. But I also really enjoy simpler movies. This was a fun comment to type out :) \n\nPS: There's no order to my list 
4	Cool idea. Here are my top 5:\n\n1) Captain Ron\n\n2) Jurassic Park\n\n3) E.T.\n\n4) Hook\n\n5) Overboard\n\nAll of my favorite movies are my favorites because of nostalgia. I can transport myself to the ages I first saw them, back to the family movie nights where my whole family enjoyed them together. They are movies I've watched dozens of times each and never grow tired of them. They may not be the critically acclaimed 'greatest movies of all time', but they are my favorites. And they all uplift me when I need a little mood booster too!
4	1) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\n\n2) Her\n\n3) The Forbidden Room\n\n4) There Will Be Blood\n\n5) Children of Men
4	The Prestige: I love everything Christopher Nolan has done and this is his best. \n\nThe original Star Wars and Rogue One as well: It's Star Wars. Do I even have to explain? I think Rogue One is the only non original one to actually be any good. \n\nIt's A Wonderful Life: I LOVE Christmas and Jimmy Stewart is my favorite actor of all time. Awesome touching movie. \n\nThe Princess Bride: anyone who's seen the movie will understand. \n\n\nEDIT: Also Pulp Fiction. I'm a sucker for non linear timelines. 
3	1. Anastasia \n2. Beauty and the Beast\n3. Mean Girls \n4. Matilda \n5. Rent
2	I'm either an INFJ or ENFJ, not entirely sure which. These are probably my top 5 movies:\n\n\nThe Lion King\n\nForrest Gump\n\nLord of the Rings\n\nEdward Scissorhands\n\nDonnie Darko\n\n\nI love psychological thrillers/horrors. Movies that make me think or mess with my perception of reality are great! \n\n\nDramas, especially coming of age/adventure ones I seem to like - or ones that tell a story through many years. I enjoy becoming really invested in characters. \n\n\nHeartbreaking romances (or ones that are bittersweet). They seem to feel more real and meaningful. I also like a good cry.\n\n\nAs for comedies, I really like absurd, wacky ones.
1	Ever After\nAmelie\nRoyal Tenenbaums\nPink Flamingos\nGattaca\nA Life Less Ordinary\nMatilda\nAirplane!
1	Good Will Hunting - feel good personal journey and development. plus the smart-fuck-up-gets-his-life-together resonates with me\n\nCerebral shit like inception or eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. It's nice to think.\n\nAction stuff like Guardians of the galaxy (laughter and explosions? what's not to love) or Rogue One (I loved the the trend-breaking ending).
3	Hello! It is I, an ENTP!	I'm researching how the different MBTI types like to be asked out/approached romantically for an article, and would like (semi) serious answers. So, if someone was interested in you, whether it be a friend or a stranger in a bar, how would you appreciate someone asking you out in a romantic fashion?\n\nThank you!\n
6	Assuming we've talked for a bit already/had a stimulating conversation and really seem to click, a simple "want to grab coffee/drinks" is a solid move. The prior assumption is key. If someone asks me out with no pretext that's a hard no. 
3	I lack the ability to understand subtlety because I overanalyze everything. So when I'm approached by the opposite sex in this manner I am often trying to figure out: why they are interested in me, what are they interested in (casual vs. serious). So the clearer those things are at the beginning the better.\n\nMost recent date had success when framing it this way: I want to get to know you because I was excited to learn you're an artist, too. I'm not sure what I want out of a relationship yet, but I figured if nothing else we could remain friends.\n\nAlso, I don't like the burden of deciding where to go. I like to be asked what sort of thing food/drink/coffee I'm feeling but don't like picking the particulars. Just tell me a time and place and I'll be there.
2	To go do something adventurous to learn the most about that person. Maybe even doing something that has a lot of emotional meaning to the person
3	Best Way To Apologize	What are some effective ways to apologize to an ENFJ?  I have broken her trust and I want to show her I care and I am reliable.  What are some ways to help mend the relationship and continue to be a part of her life? 
15	* **Unreserved apology**\n\nApologise fully. Do not make excuses. Do not give reasons. Do not defend, do not explain, do not justify. Apologise fully.\n\n* **Use "I" and not "You"**\n\nCorrect: I am sorry for what I have done, namely x y z. I know I have caused a b c.\n\nWrong: I am sorry you felt that way. You should have x y z. Maybe you can try to understand me.\n\n* **Respect her space**\n\nI have no problem cutting someone off if they messed with me because I don't like being surrounded by people who make my life harder.\n\nSometimes I decide that the relationship is over — when I decide so, my mind is made up and I simply cannot will myself to like you again, at least for the moment.\n\n* **Actually make amends**\n\n* **Actually never do it again**\n\nAlso, subscribing to TheRedPill is a fucking terrible idea. ENFJs have a knack of seeing what bullshit you're trying to emulate to conceal your real self and personally I hate that shit. Just be yourself. \n\nIf she ever knows about TRP you're in deep shit. I could never.
5	It's the same for every other personality type.  There's no special formula that will make an ENFJ forgive you.  If she's like me, you've already ruined your chances.  When someone breaks my trust there is no way to mend it.  The trust will never be fully rebuilt. Also, I can smell TRP bullshit from a mile away and would never associate with someone who believes that garbage.
2	Sincere apology and CHANGED BEHAVIOUR. \n\nNot restricted to mbti, this is canon. 
1	Know exactly what you did wrong. Apologize for it and show a changed behavior. \nMake sure it is sincere, I feel enfj can sense bs...\n\nSometimes when I do get an apology, it can take me anywhere to a few hours to a few days to accept it. So please be patient. 
1	nonv violent comunication by marshall rosenberg  \nps. its not about apologizing. apologies are redundant, its about communicating to the other person you understand his feelings and needs, and u are willing do act in their favor 
1	Not sure if this is true of all ENFJs ,but personally I used to have this recurring pattern of forgiving people easily and then hating myself for being such a pushover. The reverse is not much better though because then I feel heartless. Bottom line is that I really resent being put in this position.\n\nI have two suggestions to get past this:\n1. Work for it - seeing that you're actually making a serious effort can prevent her from feeling like a pushover.\n2. Show her you now understand her perspective in a way you didn't before. It's easy to stay mad at a bad person, not so easy to stay mad at a person who made a mistake.
2	ENFJ advice for getting over a lost friend	I'm a 21/f ENFJ who had a lot of trouble finding healthy friendships growing up. When I went to college I finally struck gold with a friend who is a ENFP. She was the first person I totally opened up to and could talk about anything. Me and her went through a lot together. As other ENFJs may understand, I loved the intimacy of the relationship; the times we cried and the times we were eachothers counselors. I asked her to be my maid of honor and she accepted. \n\nHowever, during the wedding process we started to feel distant. As with any friend, we sat down and talked and she admitted that she felt the same way. However, nothing changed about the relationship. I would reach out and she wouldn't reciprocate. She started making new friends, and when I would ask her if she wanted to hang out, she would decline and openly say that her other friends "needed her today". \n\nI was very angry about it for awhile. Its been a year and we will connect every once and awhile but every time we are together she talked about other people. I get jealous easily but I don't let it show. \n\nI havn't heard from her in about a month and I've been crying and grieving for that long, letting myself feel it. Now I want to move on. I thought out writing a letter, but it would be awkward because we go to the same college and are in all the same classes. I've been avoiding her for the past week and I just feel like there should be a next step in my recovery process. I started loosing sleep a few days ago. \n\nI'll take any tips please!! <3 
6	Sorry this happened to you. \n\nYou asked for tips on how to move on, so here's what I had done. I wrote a letter...a long, uncensored, open hearted letter. I didn't send it, and never intended to. I just needed to unload all those emotions. \n\nI decided (read: rational choice) that this person has outgrown his role in my life and it's much better we part ways. I put away things that reminded me of this person, removed his number from my phone/contacts/social media. No more contact. I resolved that I will be civil in case I run into him, but I will not, under no circumstances, initiate friendship again. \n\nI told some very trusted mutual friends about it (so they don't attempt at repairing our relationship and for them to respect my boundaries)....\n\nI said a prayer of thanks for the wonderful memories, and the painful lessons, and moved on. \n\nAnd happily, I discovered that life is full of magic and surprises. That there are other beautiful souls out there. \n\nKeep your head up. And keep smiling. 
2	Don’t hang around to be a setting sun. - Baltasar Gracian. \nYou may also want to read his book on The Art of Worldly Wisdom.\n\nI advise you to read up on detachment. The Jesuits and Buddhists have a good discussion on this.\n\nI have been through a similar situation and the readings above have helped me.
1	Was she not reciprocal, or might you be over attached?\n\n2 of my childhood best friends are ENFPs and I can imagine that they would feel so stifled if any of their friends tried to "tie them down"/ feel jealous about other friends.\n\nIf you are over attached, I think it would help if you went out and made new friends of your own. She's a friend, not an SO. I think anyone would feel stifled if they had a friend who was over invested in them.\n\nEither way, I know that intimate dynamic you're talking about. And I'm sorry this has happened. You should just do whatever gives you "closure" :) Acceptance and letting go without any animosity. Who knows, she might come back again one day and you'd be a different better person by then.
1	Saved this post because this rings TOO true for me right now too, except we're leaving for college! Take justanotherdude's advice, I wrote out a long long detailed letter - but didn't send it. This was the best advice one of my teachers gave me and it totally helped me clear my headspace and decide, is this a friendship worth continuing or should I stop my efforts? \n\nI decided to continue and am so happy I did, we just have to make very conscious clear efforts to hang out with each other and commit our time. And also I would say when losing a friend, it shouldn't always be "they were mean to me, did me wrong blah blah blah" even though that sometimes is the case. I've found I've lost friends, best of friends, loyal and caring, simply because of not being able to hang out anymore because of our schedule differences or moving or small things like that, but they were still amazing friends. If you're interested in this kinda stuff, there's a good read (I'm sure you can find it online) about friendship, Aristotle's 3 types of friendship. It's so worth reading because it talks about friends, circumstances etc, I love it! Best of luck though and I hope it works out:) 
1	I'm not exactly sure what's going on with your friend. I have a close friend who's ENFP, and we have a great relationship! He's in med school and is VERY busy. If I felt distant, he would feel distant as well. Quick skype call or phone call helped a ton and usually when we contact each other every few months it's a quick fix. If he cut me off cold turkey without a reason, I would assume he didn't want to have anything to do with me...\n\nDo you think it may be because you're married and she isn't? I know another close friend of mine got married and strait up changed....
1	This sort of resonates for me. \n\nI came out of this phase in my life totally shit. I was depressed and broken, while feeling lonely because my friends were crap.\n\nBut then I had a friend - an ENFP who I talked to about such things and she made me feel better. Then she became gradually more distant because she was busy with her own life and school. \n\nI was really hurt over this, and this led so several arguments with her that nearly destroyed the relationship. I don't think things have really recovered since then. She's as distant as ever and I'm leaving the city we live in, in less than a month.\n\nThe truth is, that I had to learn, is that when you grow apart from someone because of what happens to you, or of your circumstances, you have to accept it and move on.\n\nTry to cherish what happened in the friendship, but it is vital that you keep your head up and look forward with the knowledge that there will be more friends out there for you to meet. Potentially those who will be better and can give you more than she can ever offer.\n\nENFJ - ENFP relations are tough. My ex was one, my mum is one, and so was that friend. Just so you know, if there's anything you wanna talk about I'm here for you :)
1	Thank you for all of your comments. I'm glad that other people can understand how I feel and identify with my words. That in it's self helps. I have some good ideas and advice from this post and I'll move forward with it soon. <3 
1	Over time, people change and sometimes friendships change as well.  It seems like an outgrowing of personality.  This sort of thing happens, and I, 27/f ENFJ did not have the same best friends 10 years ago as I do today.  It definitely hurts to lose someone like that, but it's just something that happens in life
4	do you think you are you the "go to" validation giver?	
6	I wish people would. Not only would I get to make people feel better, but I’d feel better about myself knowing that people care about my opinion.
2	Yes.  When people talk to me, I actually listen and respond in a positive way.  I am genuinely happy for my friends when they accomplish something, so they often are excited to tell me about the things they do because they know I'll be excited with them.  Also, when they are sad I will listen without trying to relate or give advice.  Instead I say something like, "I'm really sorry that you have to deal with this.  I don't know how to help you, but let me know if I can.  I love you and value our friendship."  I love validating people.
1	Yes. And I think I'm really good at it.\nMaybe even too good at it.\nI feel like sometimes I'm used as an emotional fluffer.
3	ENFJ in crisis	I am a 32/m ENFJ. I am in an 8-yr relationship. But this girl walked into my life and I found myself madly attracted to her. I feel like she needs me in her life and I can save her. We got really close. But she rouses my insecurities and the thought of leaving my stable relationship for the unknown is scary. \n\nEventually we had a falling out because she broke my trust and it was the worst hurt I experienced. I decided to shift jobs so I can avoid her. I chose my current relationship over her because it was the rational thing to do. \n\nI thought shutting her out was the best course, but it I am losing sleep, my heart aches when I see her or remember her. Logic does not seem to help. Being around her makes it worse. Suicidal thoughts come. I feel like I failed at something I was meant to do -- love and protect her. TBH, I think I am in denial that i am in love with her.\n\nI think this rooted from my hero complex and she plays damsel in distress role. Has anyone gone through a similar experience? \n\n
14	Stop. I'm gonna be harsh.\n\n> I think this rooted from my hero complex and she plays damsel in distress role.\n\nHow is this an attractive dynamic? And how can this toxic-sounding and unsustainable dynamic even compare to your stable 8 year old relationship? Is "hero who saved damsel" a worthy sounding title when the corresponding one is "potential cheater with hero complex"?\n\nBe careful of untrustworthy damsels in distress with victim mindsets. I repeat, be fucking careful. \n\nSome people are great at attracting people like you — unsuspecting men with a "hero complex" who are attracted to the broken — men who see their opportunity to fix, to save, to protect. Sure, it sounds fucking exciting at the beginning. They are so so vulnerable, so feminine, but then they suck you in, use you for what you are worth, and they dump you after. They take advantage of your terrible lack of boundaries. In this sense, you might not be as special as you think. Just one of many.\n\nAny girl like her who has no respect towards your existing girlfriend, and therefore who does not stay in her lane, is unworthy of respect from me.\n\nYou are being played. Wake up.\n\nYou need to be accountable to your current partner before you deal with this damsel. It takes two hands to clap, and I'm not sure you're seeing what harm YOU have done.\n\nI'm sorry if this is harsh. If it does not fit, ignore it. Perhaps someone else can give a more sympathetic view. This has happened too many times to people in my life that I am extremely mistrustful of such a scenario.
4	Like you said, her being untrustworthy was the worst hurt you've experienced. She sounds toxic af
4	Hi. Male INTP here, so know that this comes from someone from the least competent class of relationship advice givers.\n\n>I feel like she needs me in her life and I can save her.\n\nBig time Red Flag. She might benefit from you in a mutually beneficial relationship, but no one saves anyone else. For real. But sharing and supporting someone's journey of growth is a beautiful thing.\n\nThat said, as others suggested here, when a person is trying to seduce someone away from a stable relationship, there is something going on with that person that is not going to be helpful to either of you. She is probably seeking someone to help churn the turmoil in her life, and who isn't fully available and so is ultimately disposable. My *guess* is that she is not very happy in or respectful of herself.\n\nMy 2c. Take with caution.
3	It's very easy to get caught up into helping someone on too emotional of a level. But always have a set distance you won't go past until all those issues are resolved.\n\nIt's very easy to get too emotionally invested in someone you don't know very well other than the things you help her with, to the point where other parts of your life suffer from it. For every situation like this, I have a few rules.\n\n1. Don't get close. Almost consider it business.\n2. If that person tells me to do something, first evaluate carefully if it will mess with any other parts of your life.\n3. Treat them as a low priority.\n4. Remember that nobody is even close to perfect.\n\nAs much as helping people on a deep level is interesting and a lot of fun, try not to let it be personal.\n\nLet me rephrase that: Don't let it be personal.
6	ENFJ vulnerabilities are different to other types? How we can know you are being vulnerable with us? INFP here	
11	Short answer: I'm usually an open book and I try to "have my shit together". Only people I love get to see me in my moments without my shit together — my struggles with anxiety, sadness, etc.\n\nDo you have an ENFJ you're wooing? Are you having trouble gauging his or her interest in you? \n\nOP, it's a little dissatisfying to answer your questions without knowing the context because it becomes a one sided thing where we're just answering your questions without having any sort of discussion as to knowing how that information is taken or has helped.\n\nWhat I mean is, I think we can help you better if you could just tell us a bit more about what you're confused by. But I understand that not everyone wants to share their life on the Internet.
2	Buy this book and read it, it is a great MBTI book\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Was-That-Really-Me-Personality/dp/0891061703\n\nAnd it is going to focus on the concept of something called the GRIP.\n\nWe have 8 Jungian Functions in all humans.\n\nWith ENFJs it is \n\n* Fe / Ni / Se / Ti and then 4 more functions that are called the Shadow with Fi / Ne / Si / Te\n\nWith INFPs it is\n\n* Fi / Ne / Si / Te and then 4 more functions that are called the Shadow with Fe / Ni / Se / Ti\n\nBefore I go on notice a pattern?  Both ENFJs and INFPs start with Feeling (F) as their strongest function, and then follow up with Initution (N), followed by Sensing (S), and Thinking (T) as their weakest of the primary 4 functions.  But it is a completely different style of Feeling, Initution, Sensing, Thinking, with an ENFJ it is Fe, and an INFP it is Fi and so on everything is in a 180 degree out of alingment for ENFJs and INFPs see things from different perspectives.\n\nFurthermore notice the shadow functions are the same functions as 1-4 but with the opposite alingment.  So with an INFP instead of Fi  in slot 1 on the primary / conscious personality with the shadow personality it is Fe in slot 5.  Same with 6, 7, 8 being the mirror images of 2, 3, and 4.\n\nAnd if you haven't noticed once again ENFJs and INFPs have opposite orientation of their Feeling, Initution, Sensing, and Thinking but also opposite orientation of the Shadow.\n\n------\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#Back on subject\n\nI needed to show you some symmertry before in the previous stuff, before I get to the more important symmetry but it is more advanced.  You have two types of perception functions (Initution and Sensing) and two types of judging functions (Feeling and Thinking) and once you recongize these functions also have different alingments as in Fe vs Fi for Feeling ...you need to understand this before I go to the advanced stuff.\n\nSo all human beings are either P / J / J / P with a shadow shadow P / J / J / P or they are J / P / P / J with a shadow J / P / P / J.  Why this happens you do not need to understand now but it is a natural biology thing to "escape" thought loops and getting stuck.\n\nSo with an INFP you are the J / P / P / J type as are the ENFJs who are also J / P / P / J. ^(ENFPs and INFJs by contrast are P / J / J / P)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd since ENFJs and INFPs lead with Feeling as their 1st function the 4th function has to be Thinking the other style of Judgement.  And the other style is opposite in orientation, so with an INFP it is Fi for the 1st function and Te for the 4th function (aka notice the i after Feeling and e after Thinking).  By contrast the ENFJ it is Fe for the 1st function and Ti for the 4th function.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#Almost Done with the Setup, I am sorry this is long\n\nSo your 1st function is like "free energy" most of the time you using your 1st function is not a source of stress and a source of bountiful plentiful energy with which you feed the other 7 functions.  The 4th function by contrast is the "conserative" part of you who is trying to preserve the self and prevent excess waste of energy.  In times of stress the 4th function takes control of your body and mind and not your 1st function for you feel stuck, persecuted, cornered, blah, blah, blah for your 1st function has encountered a problem it can't solve and thus your 4th function takes control.  The 4th function though is less well developed than your 1st through 3rd.  As an analogy think of the 1st function as the hero / leading parent, the 2nd function as the 2nd parent who lets the 1st lead but the 2nd parent increases the accuracy and coordination of the 1st.  The 3rd function is like a 10 year old kid who helps the parent and points out when things are missing.  And the 4th function is like a 2 or 4 year old and they can't really articulate what they need but they intuitively know something is wrong.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWell there are 8 different functions that can be in the 4th slot.  And during a state of stress when your emotional self regulation energies are at 0 or near 0 the 4th function takes control.  The book has 8 of its 15 chapters explaining what this looks like.  It is going to get really freaky when you as an INFP read the chapter 7 about what happens when Fi is hidden for your Te comes out.  You will identify with this for sometimes your "dark side comes out" and you are shocked that this was not really me yet it was.  Well ENFJs have a similar experience but it is Fe is hidden and your Ti comes out and that is chapter 9.  And so on explaining the 8 different types of "stress" induced Grips that come out.  For example my type which is INTJ but is also shared by the INFJs, we are normally creatures of Ni but when our grip is induced the Se comes out and we feel like the Hulk and we do not really like it, but the Hulk is angry and mad.  Well that is chapter 11 for the INTJs and INFJs and so on.\n\n----\n\n\n>ENFJ vulnerabilities are different to other types? How we can know you are being vulnerable with us?\n\nSo what I am saying is yes ENFJs and INFPs have different vulnerabilities.  Understanding what triggers our dark side coming out is very important for once you learn what it takes to make us "not" ourselves, you will then learn by proxy what we feel vulnerable as, and what scares us, what makes us afraid, what triggers us, and so on.
1	When I stop being charming and show my ugliness. When I don't sound happy or optimistic or don't downplay the problems I'm facing. When I focus more on talking about how I feel than making those feelings palatable to hear.\n\nIt's somewhat easy to get me to be vulnerable, but hard to get me to be vulnerable enough to admit I'm not in control of my problems and am scared.
3	Who are the people you find toxic?	I am interested in seeing the similarities among us. This may also help other types see things from our perspective better. I'll give a few of mine...\n\n- Those who manipulate people emotionally\n- Those who repeatedly break my trust\n- Those who are too insensitive they repeatedly step on others' toes without remorse\n- Those who invoke in me emotions which challenge my view of my integrity (example: a female friend who invokes strong desire in a married man)
10	All you stated plus:\n\n- people who talk shit behind their friend's back\n\n- those who feel like they are entitled to things they shouldn't be entitled to\n\n- Those who do stuff for completely selfish reasons.
6	Those who are so insistent on being right that they become blind to the emotional strain they put on others. 
3	People who won't own up to their actions /accept responsibility and apologise when they're in the wrong/have done something hurtful. 
3	I have a special place in my mental hell for people who really can't let go of other's lives, and insist on making decisions for them, when they really shouldn't. I'll give parents a bit of a break on this one, since letting go of children is hard, but people like the two-genders folk, the atheists who believe everyone should be atheist, people like that are the worst.\n\nYou have your own life to work with, stop being greedy and trying to take someone else's.
3	1. People who have no drive, or can't make themselves focus even when it's something they are passionate. Apathetic people, basically. \n2. People who, even with the best hearts, aren't self aware enough to see how they affect others. \n3. People who don't value other people. 
2	Liars...
2	Scorpios
1	So true
1	* The people who expect me to do more taking care of them than they do for themselves\n\n* The callous and those lacking empathy or compassion\n\n* Malicious people who look to hurt anyone who hurts them even when their being hurt was unintentional or a consequence of their own dumb behavior\n\n* The two-faced. I don't care if you lied to me for a good reason, but if you lied to me to cover up you did something hurtful to me and I know you're lying but you act like you value me I won't be cool with you.\n\nI have a "friend" who had a conversation that served as a catalyst for ending one of my most valued friendships. They never admitted their influence in it and I haven't forgiven them. If they just fessed up instead of indulging their pathological conflict avoidance and apologized that it hurt me--not even for doing it--I'd be very cool with them.\n\n* Hateful people and the willfully ignorant. Stop dropping slurs, asshole. When I try to explain why you're being inconsiderate or unkind and you don't listen, that's a problem.
1	People who see themselves as "better" or look down on others. You can be better at something than someone else, but YOU ARE NOT a better human than anyone else.\n\nPeople who brag needlessly. It is alright to be proud, but not to brag.\n\nPeople who ask a question and doesn't listen to the answer. You don't have to take my advice, but if you ask for it at least take my opinion into consideration.\n\nI also strongly agree on manipulators and unfaithfulness. 
2	ENFJ do you push people away? Is it the lack of trust or affraid of getting to close?	
10	There is a similar thread here by TAEHSAEN about ENFJs shutting people out. But perhaps shutting out may not totally equate to pushing people away. \n\nI'd say it would be more of lack of trust. ENFJs can hold grudges, so if you had previous dealings gone awry, it may cause the ENFJ to push you away. I see no problem with getting too close to people.
9	On another note, do you need specific help?\n\nI feel like you might be trying to understand a certain ENFJ in your life by asking us all of these questions. If I am right, it might help if you could share what you are actually confused by.\n\nYou might have seen from our answers that we are all very different. We may not give you good answers about the ENFJ you know (if there is one), but we can figure people out together.
4	Neither.\n\nI'm very selective about who I spend my time with and I won't keep anyone who is toxic.\n\nI'm referring to people who lead unproductive and dramatic lives, constantly looking for the next person to depend on, people who are nasty to my loved ones, constant complainers, users, etc.
3	I dont push people away from me,because i know someone gathered balls or strength just to talk to a unknown person,i will help if i can,even offer my friendship,but if that person is unpleasant or ignorant , someone bad...i have never been afraid of getting to close with someone,its natural,it will happen one day,so i just live with it 
3	I don't push people away ever, but I like to keep my distance sometimes. Sometimes, people I don't personally gel with want to get close, which makes them a nuisance. I tend to deal with it by not returning anything. That's not because of a problem with that person, it's just that me specifically doesn't fit with them specifically.\n\nSo if you feel like someone is shutting you out, that may be the harsh reality. It's always best to move on in such cases, as to not emotionally hurt yourself.\n\nTake care! :)
11	ENFJ being "saviors"?	Has anyone ever felt this way? I've been told that I make people feel comfortable with who they are and when they are with me, there is this sense of calm and that everything will be okay. That I'll figure out whatever sticky situation we would be in and that things can go wrong, but it won't be terrible because I'm there. At home, it happens a lot with my family; at work, my boss just told me that she depends on me a lot and that she knows that I can handle myself; with my closest friends, they said they always feel safe/comfortable/okay when they're with me; with my ex, he kept trying to fix things with me because they didn't feel okay anymore after he broke up with me... does anyone else experience this? Who do you turn to when things get too overwhelming? 
8	Yup. I've always displayed a hero complex. There was a time where having that as a piece of my personality bothered me, but now I embrace it and use it to my advantage. I'm fucking awesome and people become automatically more awesome by being around me.
8	yea I try my best to help others out of situations.  I've had people/acquaintances who hit me up after years to tell me how something I said literally changed their life.  If things get too overwhelming I take a step back and remind myself that I can't control every situation.  You can't always fix everything, and that's ok.
5	INFJ here... my boyfriend is an ENFJ and gives me serenity. He has a way of making everything seem okay even when my dramatic ass feels the world is falling on top of me. Maybe it's just the confidence I have in him... because when he says everything is going to be alright, it is; and when he says he'll be there for me, he is. It's hard to find people who actually follow through with what they say <3 But I feel, as XNFJs, we're always out to help the world out in whichever way we can... the strength I've found in my ENFJ is that he knows when to cut the cord with people (when they're taking advantage and trying to walk all over you)... I, on the other hand, don't know when to stop... the naive part of me wants to believe people are better.
4	I have a co-worker who says the same thing to me almost every time we spend a day working on a project: "I wish I had your confidence!" I thought that was odd, so about the second or third time he said it, I asked him what he meant.  He explained that when we are teamed up, he feels so at ease and comfortable because "I know everything is going to turn out right." It puts a lot of pressure on me, but on the other hand, it's nice knowing you can exude confidence even when you are pretty unsure of yourself inside!\n
5	One of my Filipino friends calls me "Salvador Del Mundo," or "Savior of the World," because of my strong sense of ENFJ altruism.  I feel a pressing and constant obligation to help and take care of others.
3	Where can I take a test to find out what "four letters" I am?
1	I've had multiple people come to me constantly seeking life advice feeling like they needed saving but wouldn't take care of themselves. It's common for people to just feel comfortable talking to me. Meh, I guess I'm grateful for that?
4	enfjs what are your hobbies?	ok enfjs what are your hobbies or inner interests?
25	Reading about my personality on Reddit
6	Quilting, reading, hiking, book club, cooking, wine tasting/classes, and travel. 
4	I enjoy reading, writing, martial arts, talking to people, learning new things... Basically, just keeping busy all the time haha. 
4	I love travel and of course, meeting new people through volunteering in the community, the arts, wherever I can.
2	I love baking and decorating my desserts! If I ever drop out of college or want a career change, I'd open a bakery! I also love drawing intricate designs like henna tattoos! \nI basically like things that involve completing a task lol. 
2	Art, photography and graphic design. I'm also into reading about psychology and anything that relates to people! 
5	Career help	I'm an ENFJ and I used to be a teacher, which I loved a lot about but with a heavy heart I had to give it up as it was preventing me from spending time with my friends & family and having any kind of life outside of work.\n\nI went back to being a Civil Engineer, which is what I did at university but have never enjoyed. I feel desperately unhappy in the role I'm in and need to do something where I feel that I'm making a difference & ideally helping people. At the very least I need communication with others through the day.\n\nI'm really interested in psychology but can't afford to retrain to be a psychologist.\n\nAny advice would be really appreciated. What jobs do you all do?
3	This is a pretty familiar story - I also studied engineering but then went into teaching, which I later quit because of the poor pay and long hours.\nI've found some satisfaction in corporate training and adult education, which can really make a meaningful difference in someone's life. Helping people gain the skills to up their career can be life changing for them, and there's demand among people starting 2nd careers, immigrants/refugees, ex-cons, etc
2	You could potentially look to be in the nonprofit field. Project coordination with your teaching background would be an easy translation.  Then you can feel great about your work.\n\nOr look into renewable energy sector with your civil engineering? Damn you have a solid backup in CE.  What are your interests?
2	I too am a civil engineer! If you want to help people and feel like you're making a difference, have you thought about combining your civil engineering degree with teaching and possibly teach at a university? As a recent graduate, I can still think of professors that really had an impact on me and personally helped me out 1 on 1 through office hours. If you had Teaching Assistants under you; you wouldn't have to spend time to grade much either! Just the typical M/W/F hour long class and office hours in between I'd assume. I know you said you aren't as interested in civil engineering anymore but maybe teaching would bring a new light to it.

2	I am 56 years old, and if I had my life to live over, I definitely would have gone into some kind of sales or consulting much sooner than I did. I had a sort of phobia about being a sales person, like it was not good enough or something.  I had to get over it. I am perfect for sales as an ENFJ, and most of us make great sales people and consultants, especially today.  With your background, you'd be a awesome selling something technical or related to engineering or education.  What works today is relationship-selling or consultive sales, both are ideal for ENFJ's.  It's not about arm-twisting, it's about getting to know people and finding out how to help them.  
2	Hey there. I'm a paramedic and I recommend it to everyone, especially a fellow ENFJ. If you have the stomach for it. If you enjoy psych, well I honestly feel like a therapist on wheels half the time and it's an incredible view into the way people live their lives. Easily branches into teaching once you have worked long enough, medic is big on mentorship.\n\nThat being said... I'm Canadian and the profession is much better here. I haven't heard great things about the states. Don't do EMS for less than 25/hr.
5	Which Harry Potter house are you in?	Just wanted to see which houses fellow ENFJs were in. I've already asked this on /r/mbti, so I thought it would be interesting to see the variety here too! Even if you have never taken the quiz, which house do you think you would belong to? Remember the hat selects you by the traits you value, not necessarily the traits you have or lack! :) 
6	Slytherin~
3	Gryffindor! Our type is known as the protagonist, after all!
3	Waver between Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw.
2	Hufflepuff! :)
2	[deleted]
2	Ravenclaw
2	Hufflepuff here.
2	Gryffindor 
1	Also Ravenclaw
1	Ravenclaw!
1	Ravenclaw!
1	Ravenclaw/Gryffindor. I fluctuate between ENFJ and ENTJ
1	Ravenclaw all the way :)
1	Gryffindor\n\nBut could probably fit into Hufflepuff as well.
1	Has anyone drastically changed within their own ENFJ type?	My friends were talking about MBTI types and decided to re-take our tests just for fun. Unsurprisingly, I got ENFJ again but then I stumbled across an old e-mail from 2015 where I had taken the same test and realized I had changed a lot even from within the ENFJ type. \n\n**2015 Results: ENFJ-A, People Mastery**\n\n**Extraverted:** 30%, **Intuitive:** 31%, **Feeling:** 52%, **Judging:** 6%, **Assertive:** 17%\n\n----\n\n**Current Results: ENFJ-T, Social Engagement**\n\n**Extraverted:** 64%, **Intuitive:** 70%, **Feeling:** 85%, **Judging:** 58%, **Turbulent:** 54%\n\nIt just seems rather strange, but I guess a lot has happened in my life since then, and my outlook has shifted a bit as well. Just wondering if anyone else has noticed any changes like mine, since I thought it was interesting-- when I was in high school, I used to consistently get INFJ as a result and ever since I've started college it's been ENFJ. But I didn't realize that even that could change so drastically, haha.
3	The test is not accurate, and it is generally agreed that personality types don't change.\n\nIt tests you based on whether you are I or E, N v S, etc, rather than by your cognitive functions — Fe Ni Se Ti.
1	A few years ago I was ENFJ but recently when I took the mbti I was ENFP. I went through a really tumultuous time where I faced a lot of failure and began doubting myself more/became less decisive over the years. Who knows, maybe it will change again as I get my confidence back
2	ENFJ What does friendship mean to you?	
5	I'm not aware of any other ENFJ's but personally friendship is everything to me. I have a lot of friends but I only truly open up to maybe 2 of my closest friends. I consider myself a very loyal friend and would do basically anything for my dearest friends. Being in arguments with my friends is the absolute worst for me and I hate it above anything else. I will go out of my way to try to recover a friendship but if I see that the other person isn't putting in the same amount of effort I have no problem with leaving the friendship. 
2	Loyalty is #1 with me.  Keeping my confidences, taking a deep interest in me, at least as much as I do in them. 
2	Friendship for me is something that is forged in the flames. I have to go through challenge and adventure with someone to truly love their good qualities. Makes it harder to make friends as an "adult" for sure. I'm 26 now and I find myself missing my friends in other states. The ones I've been through developmental phases of my life with. 
2	Would anybody be interested in creating some custom MBTI content?	Hey everybody,\nI've started an online publication aimed at various MBTI types. It uses the MBTI perspective to deliver custom content to the intended niche audience effectively. The content either aims at a specific type or is written with a certain type's perspective. Writings can take forms of essays, short stories, lifestyle blogs, personal development, or anything! but should help the readers to understand themselves and those around them in a better way.
1	I'm interested! 
13	What causes ENFJs to shut people out?	I frequently see comments where ENFJs talk about people crossing a line with them after which they shut them out. I'm an INFP and I've had fights with people before and didn't talk to them for a while until we made up, but I guess I've never been in a position where I had to shut someone out.\n\nI'm thinking that because ENFJ's lead with extroverted feeling, they're extremely empathetic and it's easier for people to take advantage of their kindness. If you all don't mind sharing, what happened when you felt like you had no choice but to shut someone out?
31	ENFJs love to help people out. I do not demand anything in return, other than perhaps a little respect -- the same respect given to other people who are not even in your lives.\n\nUnlike most of our INFJ cousins, ENFJs tend to be more trusting. People do not need to work to gain my trust; I give it freely as I believe there is good in everybody. When that trust is broken, it may be regained only at a high cost. It will be unfair to give away my trust twice for free, after all the hurt.\n\nIt takes a lot to drive an ENFJ to shut you out. I am a very patient person. I keep on forgiving mistakes, but once I feel and confirm I am being used, I'm out. Why can't people be contented with the unconditional help we give? \n\nWhy not keep on helping despite being used? Because I do not want to waste my time on people who do not share the same values. There are millions of others who can make the best use out of the help we give.\n\nWhy shut people out? Maybe because we do not have room for doubtful friends? At times the hurt people cause is too deep, it leads to dark thoughts. Despite accepting the apology, daily dealing with that person brings out negative emotions we'd rather not have. Having these emotions leads me to judge myself harshly, leading to hatred of the other party and self-blaming. So, a shut-out could really be a defense mechanism to suppress the emotions that we do not find consistent with our values.\n\nThese are just my thoughts. We may be a minority, but we also vary.\n\n
6	Though I think everyone here has already done an excellent job of responding, I'll throw in my own 2 centa, as I have unfortunately had to shut out several people from my life. I think is it my nature to always see and want to see only the best in people. I tend to assume that I can get along with just about anyone, and that near anyone has something to offer as well. My line is crossed the moment I sense any amount of malice. I can forgive ignorance, naivete, greed or selfishness over and over so long as the person is penitent, but the moment any individual acts with any degree of malice towards me, I'm done. I'll abruptly and without remorse cut ties and move on. \n\nI've got a brother who tends to take advantage of me, rather often even, but I don't mind, because in my mind its one manner I can help him out. He thinks he's getting the best of me, but for me, he simply keeps on providing opportunities for me to help him out with shitty things. I don't mind when people think their taking advantage of my good nature, but get malicious with me, and I'll dissappear from your life before the day is out. 
4	I've read elsewhere that we ENFJ's have a sort of moral behavior code by which navigate life and relationships.  We hold ourselves to a certain standard of behavior, and although our great empathy allows us to forgive minor transgressions, if we judge that a person can't be trusted or takes advantage of us, we tend to write them off.  Personally, I see this as a part of the "dark side" of my personality. I had a mentor tell me: "you put people in a box, but human behavior is much more fluid than that, people change."  I've tried to work on it, but I am by no means perfect. 
3	Iv shut out about 2 and half people. 3 of them completely abused my trust and kindness. One of them, realized how much of a dick he was being and apologized a few months later when I cut off all contact. I forgave him, however we don't chat or hang out anymore. We will occasionally check in on each other. The other 2, haven't really done much for me to forgive them. They abused my trust and kindness as well. One of them does try to reach out occasionally, but I shut her down. I feel she just wants peace, she doesn't know what she did wrong (not sure if that makes sense.) What sucks about the situation, if both of them ever needed me desperately for anything, I would try my best to help.  \n\nI feel like even though, we shut people out, I personally would help them if they desperately needed me. \n\nThe reason I said half earlier, I am currently going through this with a "friend" right now because he is abusing my kindness. He did slightly abuse my trust....I am currently questioning my friendship with him. 
3	When I feel like the effort I put in isn't returned after a long time. I'll wait, maybe a year, but if I see no change, I will shut them out to protect my fragile feelings
2	[deleted]
2	When I put my heart and soul into a friendship, but all I get is disrespect and toxicity in return. That's when I -have- to shut people out. I have a really high tolerance for other people's problems, but when my mental and physical health starts suffering as a result, it's time to let go.
6	ENFJ How would you describe the best friend (friendship) you ever had?	
6	There was this girl I used to talk to. We would talk all night and genuinely valued each others opinions. A general rule of thumb to tell if I click with someone is if I’m genuinely interested in their response, and don’t change the subject while waiting for them to answer (online messaging or whatever). That was basically the case. We were both pretty energetic and had lots of funny stories to tell. I miss those days.
6	Synchronicity. Somehow our life path mental / emotional obstacles have mirrored each other, and we bounce off each other about how we overcome them, how we feel, how we grow through them, and instead of feeling overwhelmed we both end up feeling inspired by each other! It is beautiful. Genuinely admiring, respecting each other as individuals, always giving each other the freedom to change our minds or do something else. Nothing is made into a big deal, we genuinely let each other have space, we have good boundaries but shower each other with compliments! We share a love and care for others. We relate to each other's sensitivities. We can do every day things and it still feels like an adventure. There is a strong solidarity.
3	Hey everyone! who loves food?	So one of the things I enjoy the most about life is food.  Why? Because it brings people together.  No matter what kind of personality you got, I feel like this is the one thing people can relate to.  It provides opportunity to socialize!\n\nNow, what's your favorite food?  Do you like to be the person who cooks, or just enjoy eating?\n\nMy favorite food of all time isn't constrained to one thing. But I can basically switch from KBBQ to sushi for days.  \n\nMy go to cooked dish is spring rolls and spicy pasta!  I love to make food for my friends, just seeing their happy faces bring me so much joy.  My food doesn't speak much for presentation, but it will make anyone's taste buds sing!
3	uhh boneless pizza
1	That'd be me. Cook and eat all the time.  Huge recipe collector, but it's all digital. 
1	Oh my gosh, I love spring rolls! What kind are your favourite? I love food too! My husband tends to be the cook of the household ( I find I'm not patient enough to cook but I love receiving a good cooked meal or even going out for coffee and nice lunches and dinners ) and some of my favourite things he makes are steak meals, roast dinners and homemade burger meals with avo and bacon! God, I'm getting hungry :D 
1	Thank you so much for taking the time to explain to me how you make spring rolls! I'm very excited to try our first homemade ones! :D\n\nOh yum! That sounds wonderful. What is boba? I know what macha is! Where I'm from, we get a kind of green tea macha smoothie thing! It's lovely and refreshing ! \n\nI so enjoy mixing hot and cold things ! So warm puddings with Apple or chocolate combined with cold ice cream that just melts is so wonderful! So I feel you on the icecream!!!!!! :p 
1	What is marshmallow fluff ? We get a kind of brownie that has marshmallow inside that expands and melts when you put it in the microwave ! I'm not a massive fan of meringue unless it has lemon curd ! And biscuit base.
4	The best (bday or xmas) gift to give an ENFJ is...	
13	Anything that shows you listened to their interests. An ENFJ would love any gift that shows you actually care about what they like, or care enough to listen. It doesn't have to be functional or expensive, just unique to them as a person.
5	My favorite presents i've ever gotten are the ones where I could tell the person really put a lot of time into finding sth that I'd love. Or something that relates to a shared memory. 
2	My favorite gifts have been sentimental jewelry, because it's important between me and the person and it's a physical constant reminder that I love! 
0	Depends on gender
5	When you shut people out of your lives, do you ever let them in again?	It takes a lot of negative experience for us to shut people out of our lives, right? How often do you let them in again? What are the things you look for before allowing them into your lives again? Do you still treat them the same way as before?
10	I generally don't. If I do, they're kept at an arms distance. 
8	I've shut out people before for repeated, reckless, disrespectful behaviour. Once they're out, they're toast. \n\nSincere apology and changed behaviour will be the only way they can come back to my life, but that hasn't happened yet. \n\nI don't shut out people lightly tho. 
6	I don't think I've ever shut anyone from my life. In my mind, we're all stupid humans, who deserve to learn and grow.\nIt's me the one who has to learn to cope with people's particular personalities
3	I find that it's not long before I let someone like that back into my life. I'm not the type to hold a grudge though, I wonder if many ENFJs are.
2	I had a realization today. A healthier alternative to shutting people out is to restrict them to their niches in our lives and set strict boundaries. \n\nBut of course, this can only be possible after we finish dealing with the hurt and inner darkness their actions have stirred.
1	they have to try really really hard to redeem themselves
1	[deleted]
1	I'm thinking in terms of boyfriends that have done something very hurtful to me. I may act amicable around them if I run into them again, but there is no reality where I would ever let them back into my life again. If you left or hurt me at one point to such an extreme, how can I be sure it won't happen again?
8	As an ENFJ how often do you go through your old photos? are those random moments for you? or moments of nostalgia or even depression? How easy can those photos take you back to those old days?	
4	Nostalgia hits me very very hard. I choose to not look back often because it can make me sad. I also lean towards thinking I was always "better" in the past and put myself down for any percieved inadequecies.
2	Allll the time for different reasons, nostalgia, comparing my life to then and now, reigniting old memories 
2	I like looking at photos of my good old days. Certain scents, music/sounds, and tastes can also evoke a lighthearted nostalgia. I purposefully do things that bring me back to the past as a means to escape briefly from the present.\n\nOf course, I avoid anything reminding me of hurtful memories like the plague. These things can not only remind -- but can actually bring back the pain.
1	It's random for me. When I look at the photo, I have like a flashback of the memory 
1	Literally ALL the time. So much so that I don't even think I have capacity for nostalgia! Never experience depression, just nostalgia and usually something in face-to-face conversation prompts me to go digging to explain any sort of story. 
1	i remember being about 10 years old, going through my baby pictures and crying because I wanted to be a baby again lmao :/
6	ENFJ When you ask a person to hang out, invite them to things or initiate one-on-one's is it just out of friendliness or you really like that person?	
12	I've never given an invite that I didn't genuinely hope the person would take me up on. 
4	[deleted]
1	I usually want to hang out with people with good vibes, so if I'm inviting you or hanging out with you it's because i really want to.
1	For me, I never invite someone I am not interested in on some level. I may have a lot of acquaintances and I am very social, but when I issue an invitation to connect it is sincere. 
6	Need cheering up	I'm an ENFJ, and right in this moment I am just feeling very very down cause there's heaps of stuff going on in my life which is giving my inferior Ti a lovely time of making me feel very insecure and self critical. I'm not at any risk, otherwise I would be getting help, so don't worry! I have great support networks and all that, and I literally just talked through all of my feelings with my INFJ best friend. \n\nBut right now I've decided to just take a second for myself and just try to get into better spiritis.\n\nSo question: What do you fellow ENFJs do to cheer yourselves up? What would you suggest?\n\nThanks :)
5	For me, I usually just wallow in the feelings of sadness for a while by watching super sad movies. Something about crying (only ever in private) in emotional movies helps me with my own sad feelings and after a day or two I just seem to get back to my usual self again.
3	I keep myself busy. \nWhether is school, work, projects, binge watching shows (binging ozarks on Netflix currently). I'll go hang out with friends. \n\nThis keeps my mind away from sad thoughts! \nI usually feel the saddest during bed time, but if I have a busy day, I knock right out
2	I read this subreddit and other material on ENFJ personality. Reading expert opinions on our personality type helps me affirm our strengths and acknowledge our weaknesses. It feels like a guru is telling me "Look, this is who you are. You have a very beautiful personality. You are not alone."\n\nWhatever it is you're going through, I am confident that your light will overpower the darkness trying to stifle you.\n\nA pint of Ben and Jerry's and/or a bar of chocolate will also help.\n
2	I usually call my friends. I cycle through at least five so as not to exhaust anyone :) \n\nLong walks also clear my mind. \n\nThen there's alcohol lol. Not advising it per se, but you asked how I deal with my issues and this one is a go to (I do limit it tho). 
2	Splurge on a great bottle of wine, find someone to share it with and have a romantic evening.  
1	you might have to take a look at other perspectives.  I know for me I thought I had it bad until my friends and significant other started sharing things that are stressing them out in life.  It makes you look at yourself and feel like you're doing a lot better than you thought.
1	I try to keep myself busy so that I can keep my mind off of what's bothering me. Also, watching anime (especially romantic anime!), reading, and talking to a close friend makes me feel better. Sometimes thinking about the issue helps. Other times it makes it worse. When I'm very very sad, I SLEEP! (Because sleep helps most problems :D ) 
3	Unhappy and need career suggestions	Hello fellow ENFJ's! Just had a question out there mostly because I have no clue what I want and kind of need advice to get to the right path:\n\nI currently work as a parts manager for maintenance department of tractor and trailers, AKA i work with mechanical work which is rated lowest of happiness on career suggestions for this personality type. Which, I completely agree with! I try my best everyday and I feel like even though i've come a long way to where I'm at now, my best is not good enough for the company and it's a lot of stress on me. Side note I was promoted to parts manager having only one year experience in the transportation field.\n\nI'm extremely stressed all the time and have no fulfillment at the end of the day just glad it's over. Not to mention, this job does not pay well and its pretty damn close to minimum wage.\n\nMy question to you fellow redditors: are any of you working a full time job that you're completely happy with,content, fulfills you, and doesn't seem like a job to you? What kind of conditions do you work in? What field are you most happy in or would see yourself being happy in? Most importantly what steps did you take to get where you're at now?\n\n\nThank you in advance guys, glad to see other people like me!
2	the job doesn't really matter to me as long as I like the people I'm working with.  My work environment is my top priority and everything else falls into place. I'm working as a data analyst right now, and despite it being very repetitive and mundane, being able to chat with my coworkers about random stuff perks my day.
11	I love you enfj's	My current girlfriend of 11 months is one of you and I'm honestly amazed at how much persistence and love she can show. Emotions aren't my strong suit, but I always feel at peace around her. And at the same time, she's so perceptive without realizing it. \n\nI love her and I love you guys for existing. \n\n-an entp
4	<3 hugs right back :) 
2	Take care of her, bro. It's easy to please an ENFJ lover. Don't forget to make her feel appreciated. 
1	❤❤❤
1	Aww we love you, too! And, well, just about everyone! (wags tail)
1	Anyone here ever dated an INFJ?	I'd really like your advice if you have!\n\nI normally consider myself to be a decent gift giver and event planner, but I've always had trouble thinking of a good gift idea for my INFJ boyfriend. Of all the gifts I've given him over the years, he only likes the clothes I pick out. I want to do better than that though!\n\nFrom the surface, he doesn't seem to feel strongly about receiving any type of gifts. What could be a meaningful gift to an INFJ SO?
2	Married to and INFJ for 36 years. She does not really like gifts all that much. Instead she values experiences.  She'd much rather I plan and take her to enjoy a fabulous night out on the town or a weekend away than buy her a nice piece of jewelry.  
2	60 dollar gift voucher from Daiso. It comes in 30s only though, so you can get 2 30s XD\n\ncontext: I'm INFJ, female, and I'd go totally nuts if I got this gift. One thing, I love attractive, pointless things, another -I'm above wasting money on attractive, pointless things, so if someone else does the purchasing for me, I have an 'excuse' to let myself go XD\n\nGave this as a gift to my female INFJ friend, and she spent one voucher on practical things, and the other on pointless things. Haha the push against Se is strong, which is why you need two vouchers.\n\nEvery INFJ is different, though. Don't know if a male INFJ would be that much into Daiso, but the point is that our inferior Se goes nuts over attractive, pointless things.
1	I have an INFJ girlfriend and honestly she loves the fact that i just plan events and take her where she really wants to go. It's easy to probe and things she'll mention i'll write down for later when her bday comes closer.\nI think though a nice present is an experience. Something they've never done that's outside of their comfort zone aka something they wouldn't have done without someone outgoing or up for an adventure!\n\nI'm sure he would appreciate it. \n\nIf its just a gift I'd honestly just straight up ask him what he wants for his bday to give you a list of 5 things. I also had my girlfriend do that for me.
11	What makes ENFJ fall madly in love? How does someone win your heart?	
19	Authenticity. Just be raw and real with me. 
11	The people I've had deep feelings for, they've always had a certain lightness to their hearts, and I've known there was something special about them from the moment I met them.\n\nIt happens when I first meet them or I'm never able to feel anything real.  (I'm usually in denial about it for a few days after this happens, like "no! not again")\n\nThey've always felt sort of pure, genuine, authentic.  And they usually have a personality trait I am developing/lack. \n\nie I learn from my ISFP to listen more closely to those around me because he seems to actually care more than me, but shows it more quietly.\n\nAnyone I've fallen for has always inspired me.  But they can't be cringey about it!  Some people fake authenticity to look good and that is uncomfortable and even terrifying.  Never put any of us ENFJ types on a pedestal.
10	It depends on the ENFJ, but for me, it's been partners who display an equally goofy sense of humor and wit, intelligence, emotional sensitivity, and an air of complexity and substance beneath their everyday facade. Something to the effect of "still waters run deep."\n\nETA: seconding the feeling of purity that rizzlebeam mentions. Almost childlike in a way.
2	hayyy kvothe! ^_^
1	its diff for each enfj.  depends on what quirks we like and admire.
1	There has to be a connection. I have had three long-term relationships and only in the last one (I have realized) I actually love my partner. The love comes from our ability to be completely open with each other. What I know, she knows. What is hers is also mine. There has to be a two-sided openness, and of course the two sides has to "click". That is not something that can be determined via love at first sight. I did realize very early that I really really like the girl I am now with, but it took us both a while until the interest developed into real, deep, full-blown Love. 
-2	Big heart, bigger wallet, biggest dick.
1	What does an ENFJ dating profile pic look like?	Apparently we ISTjs and ENFjs are most compatible based on socionics intertype theory. So how do I spot you guys online?
5	As far as I'm aware, Socionics types and MBTI types do not perfectly translate to one another. For instance, I'm fairly sure an ISTj would be an ISTP in MBTI. \n\nI say this, because in MBTI it's generally accepted that ENFJs and INFPs are most compatible. I have never found myself to be compatible with ISTJs, as they can be a lot more rigidly adhering to logic than us ENFJs, who live more on the over-emotionally intuitive side. 
3	Wait, are you a socionics ISTj?  If so, you're an ISTP in Meyers Briggs. \n\nIf you're *actually* MBTI ISTJ, you're barking up the wrong tree. You want an ENFP. 
2	You can't identify people like that physically.  Like, how do you tell if someone has depression, you can't because it's a mental thing not a physical thing.
3	Well mine are just selfies...And I look damn good. 
1	Can confirm socionics ISTj is actually an MBTI ISTP. An easy way to remember this is the extroverted types don't change, MBTI ENFJ is the same as socionics ENFj, ENFP is the same as ENFp. It's only the introverted types that change :) so an MBTI ISFJ would be a socionics ISFp, MBTI ISTJ is a socionics ISTp, just swap the J and P for introverted types, hope that wasn't too confusing! 
2	Enfj- On Manipulation through omission	I (27/f/enfp) ended a relationship last night be because he (27/m/enfj) established that he can at any time date other girls. Earlier he has told me that we weren't fuck buddies but couldn't get around to saying I love you. I assumed that meant that he wouldn't fuck other people but had emotional hang ups. I asked him several times to gauge the temperature of the relationship. I communicated my love towards him and helped him a lot. He said that me helping him was a negative thing and that I was being too nice.  I'm lost and sad. I need hugs. ENFJs y u so evasive and manipulative? I wanted someone who would give back as much as I give forth. 
12	Doesnt seem ENFJ to me, or at least not a healthy one.\n\nMaybe he doesn't trust you?
4	It's not very fair (for you and for us!) to think of all of us as evasive and manipulative. We are so different even amongst ourselves, and most of us are extremely loving and honest creatures :(\n\nWhatever type he is, whatever he is going through, and whatever excuse he has...he's just not that into you. \n\nI think regardless of type, it sounds a little like you're very into him, maybe he thought you were putting him on a pedestal? I think most people shy away from that... It's a pity, I know, because you were just looking for someone who would give you as much as you gave.\n\nI'm sorry if that is tough to hear. You seem like someone who puts her all into people you love and girl, you deserve way better. Cut your losses and find someone who appreciates you!
1	He's not healthy. He Moved away from friends and family. Flies back to visit every other weekend m which drains his bank account and mental capacities. He over extends himself to help other people but doesn't seem to see me in the corner helping him. Makes me so sad 
5	ok so a common thing i read about enfjs is....?	is that  they have aTendency to strongly dislike, fear and avoid being alone – may turn to dark, self-deprecating thoughts when by themselves..ok so 1)how do you guys fear being alone,and 2)what are theres dark thoughts that enfjs turn to that i always read about???
8	I'm exactly how you described. I hate being alone, even if I'm not saying anything. Self deprecating is a bit much, but rather just a little insecure. Stuff like "why did i say that?" thinking about previous experiences, or just judging my appearance.
6	How interesting. I am almost never alone because I live in close quarters with toxic people, which makes me crave being alone. But in terms of friendships and relationships I'm clingy and I don't usually need or want space. \n\nI'd say that I don't necessarily fear being alone, but probably only because I rarely ever am truly alone. Since I do spend a lot of time alone but not *completely* alone, I dwell on how much I hate my lack of privacy and close quarters, and when I don't have someone or something to distract me I definitely get depressed. My darkest thoughts are the most obvious ones. I'm not suicidal but I have suicidal thoughts and ideation and just really negative perceptions about myself and my living situation and instead of trying to be productive and focus on what I *can* change I'll start to dwell on how much longer I have to deal with my current situation and how miserable it makes me. And then the spiral downwards begins...\n\nFortunately I work 40+ hrs a week and at my job I pretty much have to be social, so that helps break it up. 
5	There are times when I like alone time, then there are times when it becomes dangerous.. like self depreciating thoughts and potentially suicidal idealisation. Given, I have other things going on in my life so other people might not fall off the deep end like I do, but I feel like we're usually creatures of socialization. We thrive on good connections. I need something going on consistently it seems to just keep my mind busy. 
2	It definitely varies from person to person, but as for myself I appreciate a little bit of alone time. I tell those I live with that I like to have some unwinding time when I first arrive home; we can hang out and chat in 30mins-1hr :) I call it "de-working", which is basically a mental recharge.
2	I definitely don't like being alone - I got a pet for that exact reason. I definitely get down on myself sometimes - worry, get anxious, doubt myself. I force myself to get out of my own head - go for a walk, watch some TV, do some art, something.
2	I don't like being alone, but i'm shy and worried about my body image (i'm obese). I was on the /r/introvert (I thought I was introverted, but after reading there I was dead wrong.) and was reading about people who hate having roommates, because of dealing with small talk and what not, and I enjoy those things types of things. Now i've been focusing on myself and know what I can become, I guarantee it.
2	Too much alone time leads me to dark thoughts, too. Past hurts would resurface and I would once more fight to suppress the memories of people I've decided to shut out of my life. Too much thinking brings out suicidal ideations. \n\nIt helps to be with people I am in tune with as I am reminded there's a lot to live for.
3	How a person can know if you consider them a close friend (best friend) since ENFJ is so friendly with most people	
13	I can't speak for every ENFJ, but the major difference between my best friend is I open up and talk way more about my own feelings or opinions compared to other people. If you ever talk with an ENFJ, you might notice how we always seem to be the ones doing the asking, but never being asked our opinions or feelings on matters much. \n\nIf I know I can trust someone or I'm close to someone, I'm way more inclined to mention my own thoughts than just general chat with other people. Even if it isn't "small talk" that I'm having with someone, I rarely give my own opinion and mostly listen or gauge other people's responses and adapt to the flow of the conversation. Hope this helped :) 
3	Honestly i dont have a best friend,i had many...they disappointed me,then i made a smaller closed group of people,they did it too.\nAfter that,i even had only one mate(I gave up on female friends,they just wanted relationships),and even he betrayed me.\nSo now,my gf is my best friend in a way...and how do i know that,well,she kinda knows me as much as i know myself
2	Studying	How to learn biggest possible amount of text from coastal and celestial navigation,i have 20 days or im failing whole year.\nPlus i have math exam but that i will just practice....\nI havent studied from 6th grade of elementary(in this way,to just remember text),so im not quiet familiar with studying,i mostly listen during classes and remember it all.\nAny help or advice would be nice
3	One really major tip I could give you is to go through the material thoroughly once while making your own notes of relevant portions or sections, and then go over those notes as many days as you can! Spaced repetition is a really fantastic way to learn!\n\nFor the math, just do practice problems everyday, the more consistent, the better your proformance will be!
2	You need to make a plan and follow through. Split up the work evenly among the days you have. Leave st least 2 days before the exam to relax and review material.\n\nLet's say you have 2 weeks (14 days) and have to review 12 chapters, just do a chapter a day. BUT here's the key trick. Review the material for 20 mins or so (however long it takes you) you learned the day before each day. \n\nEx: \nday 1: learn ch 1\nDay 2: learn ch 2 + (take 20 mins to review ch 1)\nDay 3: learn ch 3 + review ch 1 and 2\nDay 4: learn ch4 + review ch 1,2,3 \n\nEach day you review a ch, the faster you'll be able to review it.\n\nI didn't think this method would work but my advisor told me try it. I was surprised how well it worked..\n
1	adderall
1	Idk if this works for other ENFJ's, but summarize what you're reading after every new thing you're learning. In college, whenever I got to the end of a page or a section in a textbook, I would type down in my own words in a google doc what that section was teaching. Then, when studying later on, I could look back and read through my own notes which is a lot easier to understand because I would always word it in really simple ways I knew I would understand. Doing so also FORCES you to pay attention to the passages and really comprehend what you're reading, you actually save so much time not having to reread because you zoned out.
5	INFJ married to ENFJ	Any advice? I'm trying to understand him better. We've been married 6 years now and are very much in love but keep hitting a big wall of misunderstanding when it comes to how our personalities function. Feel free to ask any questions.
3	INFJ female here with a male ENFJ partner. We're fairly new to each other (9 months) but in my experience our biggest issues with each other rely in the following:\n\n1. Because we both have the Fe function we're both VERY emotional people. We have high highs and low lows, meaning when we get in fights negative emotions run really high and it turns into negative emotions bouncing off each other causing it to make things toxic and worse. When this happens we both have to step back and evaluate everything logically before we approach each other again. Approach why we're feeling the way we're feeling and how we can do better next time etc. \n\n2. The introversion vs extroversion thing is a bit different for us. He's an introverted extrovert so his need for people isn't as great as a normal extrovert. However, he's a very head strong person, when something needs to be done or he wants something he will tackle it like no one's business. I on the other hand am very much a more cautious person, I weigh the pros and cons, I'll point out everything that can go wrong and put the breaks on things if I need to. I'm an anxiety/depression prone person as well and he has a hard time understanding why I don't take life by the horns like he does. This is probably our biggest issue that we're currently working on and trying to understand. \n\nWhile ENFJ's and INFJ's are very similar they do face problems just like any other type you'd be romantically involved with. I do need specifics about your relationship so I can perhaps provide insight
3	Can you give an example/scenario? 
2	Are you certain of your types?  I am having a hard time wrapping my head around this being a problem that you could have in an INFJ ENFJ relationship, since you share all the same cognitive functions in similar order. \n\nUnderstanding should be the least of your worries, so I have to ask. 
1	Six years is a good long time--congratulations! I am an ENFJ married to an IFNJ stoic Swede for 24 years. We recently compleyed the personality tests and found them eerily accurate and quite helpful.\n  The way he copes with me is to view me as a very friendly, excitable balloon that he has on a string. He watches me bob along, socializing, helping, needing to be right and truthfully, he most often lets me lead. If he really disagrees, he will lay out his reasons and we discuss it and I will bend a bit. \n  I view him as the old ball and chain at times but this is an open and loving acceptance of the introvert-extravert duality in our relationship. 
2	Enfj needed	Me and a couple of other people are trying to form a group on kik with one for each type just to see what happens. If you are interested leave your kik username here or pm it to me. Any age is fine, I'll contact the first one who replies.
4	I don't think enfj will install kik to be honest
10	ENFJ how do you express your care to (friends, family, SO) and how do you like to receive it?	
8	The primary love languages I like to receive are words of affirmation and quality time. I like hearing how much I matter to someone a million times more than anything else. That said, I tend to show it through acts of service primarily. 
6	Expressing-giving! We like to give and make others happy! We really enjoy others happiness! For example: if I'm just hanging out  with a friend, he or she casually mentions "oh I need a new tea pot."  I know that their birthday is coming up, I'll surprise them with one lol. Or just making them feel special by things they've shared. My bff, loves hugs. Every time I see her, I give her a shit ton of hugs. We also pay attention and try to connect with others. If someone is upset, I try my best to cheer them up. It feels great to see a smile on their face! \n\nAs for receiving, I just get happy over the fact the person is thinking of me or remembers me. Even receiving a text like "hey was thinking about you, hope you have a great day!" Makes my day and makes me very happy. Or if someone tells me they were missing me. 
5	 If a friend or family member mentions something that they have been wanting, if I see it, I'll get it for them. So I guess you can say we show love by being thoughtful and giving. I also show love by listening to when other people need to talk, vent, and try to give some words or encouragement. I also show love by doing things for others. Whether that's doing them a favor like helping them move, clean, paint their room, find a new outfit, with work they have been struggling with or giving advice. \n\nAs for how I receive love, it definitely makes me feel loved when someone makes an effort to spend time with me. The more someone wants to do fun things with me or thinks to invite me somewhere, it makes me feel wanted and appreciated.  
3	I'm a practical person, I show my love and support by being truly concerned about their needs and well-being. When I know they're struggling with something, I (unexpectedly) come with a way to make things better.\n\nAnd I like to receive the same thing, I value actions more than words. 
1	Hugs. That is all. 
1	fe and sociopaths?	i dont know why but to me types with fe tend to be sociopathic?,like enfjs yes they help people but if its needed they can cut all atachment to someone quickly.and do the most horrific things to them?
9	sociopaths aren't defined by mbti.
7	[deleted]
5	I'm not sure what this post is even asking.
3	I wouldn't use the word sociopath....\nIf someone abuses my kindness or trust or any relationship with me, I have no problem cutting them out of my life. I wouldn't want harm to come to them, I lit just don't want to have anything to do with him. It's just a lot easier to deal with people that way. 
3	I wouldn't say sociopath, but I get what you're saying. My mom is an ESFJ (I'm sure of this) but she has gotten very manipulative over the years. I know that most people with dominant Fe are caring empathetic and social by nature, but Fe has a "dark side" as well. I think that my mom uses Fe to find out what people's weaknesses are, what they want, and how they feel. The thing is, she tends to assume that she knows exactly how everyone else feels, even if she is completely inaccurate. Then she continues to push at your boundaries even if you're clearly telling her not to "help". My theory (idk what else to call it) is that Fe has weaknesses (like any other cognitive function) and one thing I've noticed that something Fe users do sometimes without realizing (kind of ironic) is that they seem to be constantly looking outward to the point of projecting their feelings onto others, similar to narcissistic/sociopathic projection. That's what I've observed about more manipulative ExFJs. It also seems that insecure ExFJs are reluctant to look inward and reflect on themselves when they are alone, so they spend more time with other people's problems in an attempt to help them fix their own, which is also another reason why they tend to project negative feelings onto others who may not even feel they need help with those issues. This is also what I've noticed about my ENFJ sister and other Fe-dominant people when they are dealing with insecurities.
3	Honestly? No. From my experience, Fe users are great at creating harmony. At the very worst, you would have your own negative vibes projected back at you.
3	ENFJ needs to feel safe to open up. What people can do to make you feel safe?	
7	I like to show more feelings and care about what the other person is interested in or express my feelings for what we have in common.   
6	Tbh think a lot of us are extreme open books. I think as long as people seem to care (asking questions) or are in need of help, I'm willing to open pretty much anything about me. 
5	I think ENFJs are the type this title *least* applies to... 
3	We just open to anyone whomever we get a good vibe from lol \n\nI do think we keep some personal things to ourselves, that we open up to a few special people in our lives. 
2	STABILITY. I feel safe and open up to my romantic partner if j know you're not just going to up and leave. 
2	Be vulnerable first. Show the real you and people are typically more at ease. 
6	Best ENFJ Book?	Hello, friends! I'm an ENFP currently reading The Comprehensive ENFP Survival Guide and I find it very fascinating. I was hoping that one of you have read an equally fascinating book on ENFJ's that I would be able to recommend to my friend.
4	ENFJ: "Afraid" of dating..	Hey fellow ENFJ's! (Or other types browsing!) First time poster, just thought I'd do a small intro since I'm new and really excited to have found this subreddit and people to relate to! I'll try and keep this as short as possible, sorry if I tend to drag on in places! Long post ahead just to give a good idea of why I might be like this but the main point is to find out if anyone can relate or just has any general comment to make.\n\nThe title of this may be confusing, since from what I've gathered ENFJ's tend to just "go for it" when it comes to dating or if they like someone. I have only ever been in one serious relationship when I was 15 for 5 years (I'm 21 now) and we never really had a "dating phase" since we went to school together and talked all the time, became friends and eventually romantically involved etc.\n\nLong story short, I had feelings at the start for him but eventually over the years it just started to... fade away is the only way I can describe it as harsh as it sounds. He wasn't a great boyfriend before (long story I'll spare the details) so I broke up, but we got back together when he said he would change and things did get better. But the nagging feeling of not being able to return his feelings when he was clearly giving all of his to me was what caused me to end it a second time... It was honestly the worst thing I've ever had to do, felt like I literally ripped his heart out so I still feel guilty to this day about it (curse you Fe!) so I think that's why I'm apprehensive or scared to give dating or another relationship another go, it's the fear of losing feelings again and hurting another person. \n\nI did a bit of soul searching after the break up, which is how I found out about MBTI etc, and I also discovered I might be more interested in the same sex ( so I'm blaming the "fading feelings" on that which might seem crazy). My best guess is this also might be causing the fear of dating, but I also tend to overthink situations where dating is concerned, such as what if the person really likes me but I don't return the feelings? (Again curse you Fe). Since I never had proper date after being in a relationship for that long and being 21, I think that also adds to why I might be afraid to try dating since... well I've never properly been on one with someone I don't know well (even though the point of dating is to get to know someone I know...) \n\nI didn't think the post would turn out this long whoops... a TLDR version is can you relate to being afraid to ask someone out or date them for any specific reason I haven't mentioned? Some ENFJ related reason that might seem insane to other types? Am I just an unusual ENFJ that doesn't bite the bullet and just go for it when it comes to dating? If you made it this far thank you for reading and hopefully we can get some good discussions going! \n\n\n
3	I have an ENFJ friend that up until two months ago was afraid to date anyone. However now that I convinced him to give it a try he loves it and thanks me all the time. \n\nI'd recommend finding out more about who you are. For myself I found that researching personality types has helped me discover more about myself (though don't generalize yourself and remember you're a unqiue individual). You can also try new hobbies or going out and meeting people. \n\nAs for your part about feeling pressured to date and such. Being an INFP I tend to idealize my partner so I thought I'd give my input. Honestly apart of me does expect my partner to show love but if they are having a bad day or going through something I always understand and will show support for them. Explaining to me that you're busy or you want time to yourself really helps and I rarely ask questions. Though I go into a relationship knowing how you tick and flow. So I only worry if you begin to act suspicious or different and I don't know why. I also ask if I can see myself spending the rest of my life with the person and that they will change over time. So if I am in relationship I am there to stay unless something drastically changes for the worse.
3	I'm an ENFJ and trust me I can relate- but it gets better. I'm 23 now and I'm in my third (final) relationship. In my experience, I very much prefer to help others and I can keep feelings hidden away like none other to prevent pain for someone else. I can only imagine after 5 years how hard that must've been for you. \n\nOnce I got back into the dating scene following high school I went through a random hookup stage where I felt really, really empty. Was chasing the love feeling I used to have, but found nothing. Then, I decided I wasn't going to officially date someone until I met the person I could not turn down. 4 years later and I couldn't be happier today for waiting and stopping the random hookups.\n\nEntering relationships will never be like the first time when it feels like it'll be forever, but give it time and give people a chance and you will surprise yourself. Just take any potential relationship very slow and make sure you feel secure before completely opening up-- that's when the feelings really compound. Hope at least something I've said feels relatable/helps! Wish you the best 
1	I'm scared too lol... 
12	Why do ENFJs constantly blame themselves for anything/everything? How to help my friend stop beating herself up?	Is this just a mood you go through sometimes, or do you constantly feel like you're to blame for whatever mishap is going on at any given moment? \n\nIs this part of your process of healing? To me it seems very counterproductive to have these conversations where my ENFJ friend turns everything against herself that she possibly can. But if its just part of the healing process I guess I can keep up my patience and keep just hearing her out. \n\nIt's kinda hard to try to offer ideas as a friend only to have them twisted into self hatred. I want to help her feel better. I'm not going to stop talking to her but I just want to know what this mechanism is. \n\nThanks for any replies. Sorry for sounding somewhat cryptic. She might read this, though it's doubtful. Also, I'm an intj female if that means anything in this context.

5	Hi OP. as an ENFJ, I tend to do this a LOT. It's wired into the F trait fairly deeply, and combined with a strong J function, it gets fairly disastrous. \n\nFor me, i blame myself when I can see - even in retrospect - that I could've done something different to avoid the mistake. I beat myself up for things I've done, and moreso when I know I've hurt someone. \n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO: as an intj, you need to know your limit. From what I know, INTJs are very good at giving solutions to problems and seeing the big picture, but aren't great at emotional support. When your friend comes to you, ask: do you want solutions or emotional support?\n\nENFJs, if they're on a rough patch, tend to need a lot of emotional support and validation. For me, I cycle through my friends so as not to exhaust them. I also know which friend can solve it and which can give emo support...so I act on that basis. \n\nThere's not much you can do to help your friend if she just needs emo venting. Tel her to write a journal, that usually helps...other than that, time. \n\nAlso...when I'm hurting, the emotions are like a tornado that keeps on rippling. I'll vent with a Friend to get it off my chest, only for it to come back. It's because the feelings haven't subsided. It takes time and multiple repetitive conversations (that's why I cycle through my friends lol). It's just the way it is, that's how we deal with the emo shitstorm. \n\nIt also doesn't matter whether we know rationally or logically that our feelings are out of proportion or whether we know the solution or not, until the emo hamster steps off the wheel, we'll continue to feel bad and process it. Hopefully we get so emotionally exhausted and then we'll stop. 
2	Ha. Still figuring this one out 😁\n\nI screwed up recently with my family in a way I had not done in a long time, and I felt awful about it. My INTJ mother gave me an honest view of the situation (What I know her to do very very well) and just said that everyone screws up, and to make it right. \n\nI felt awful for about 24 hours, even though I understood that it was all taken care of. It just is a part of me. But turning everything against her seems too harsh of her. \n\nBe an honest and objective person to turn to. Give an accurate view of the situation, and make sure she knows that you have that quality. When it's not her fault, make sure she knows it isn't her fault. If she screws up, make sure she fixes it and then understand that everyone screws up. Having that sincere and objective view is appreciated.\n\nAt some point she does have to get over it, and learn that blaming yourself isn't helpful in the long run. She can't think of everything. She isn't omnipotent.\n\n
5	Harmonizing groups, have you witnessed the spirituality of frequencies and patterns?	I am beginning to value the importance of frequencies in life. My definition of frequencies casts a wide net of subjects. It includes music, daily habits, internal thought patterns, moods, and even generational family cultures. \n\nWhile working with children, my sense of connectedness and harmony has grown. During a story time, you need to feel your audience. One of the most rewarding things is to watch a class of rambunctious kids feel the rhythm in a silly song, and focus....I love watching them clap to the beat and attempt to predict what will happen next. \n\nThese are more than silly songs. This is often the first time a child learns to connect to a group and participate in something bigger than them. The connectedness I feel at work is such a blessing.\n\n Have you witnessed the power of harmonizing frequencies? People's moods connecting, groups developing an overall pattern of being? Good or bad vibes? 
3	Oh my god I love this subreddit, I totally relate and I'm so glad other people can feel that same sort of unspoken "vibe" in the air that is other people connecting. Sometimes I feel crazy! \n\nI throw a lot of small little parties, one about every week or so. I'll invite three to five of my friends over, in almost entirely different combinations. A lot of them are from different friend groups, (IE: friends from high school, friends from college, friends from work, friends I met at the bars, etc.), and when arriving to the same party a lot don't know each other. By the end of the night, they're all drunk and laughing together and already have their own inside jokes and I just watch and smile. \n\nIt's so much fun to play party host, because that role is entirely about forging connections and establishing a mood and harmonizing frequencies. I'll know that two guys both are interested in hiking / mountain biking / rock climbing so that's how I'll introduce them, and when there's a lapse in that conversation I'll ask one about how the redesign on his car is going, knowing that the other is really into mechanics and cars. I don't stay involved in the conversation, but every two or three minutes I'll pass by and check in on how it's going. If they're not immediately hitting it off or harmonizing, I jump in and stoke the coals of the fire to get it going. I've never not been successful. It's such a good feeling seeing groups of people come together in complete harmony and all be in such a good mood around each other and feel like you got to help make that happen. 
2	I thought this was just me! One group of friends sometimes don't even bother meeting up if I don't go... or they do and one friend tells me that it's not the same when I'm not there. Though I find it tiresome if I'm not in the socializing mood, it seems to be something I can be good at if I can find the right vibe/frequency. 
7	Flaws and fixes	Hello fellow ENFJ-ers! I was just wondering what you guys see as your biggest flaws and what you do to try to fix (or mitigate) them?
9	Extraverted feeling: this has been my blessing and curse. It's a blessing because I can connect easily with people and maintain relationships across space and time. I get to know people well in make deep connections. It has been a curse because I feel the constant and almost insatiable need to be connected. It manifests negatively especially in romantic relationships where if I don't attempt to control this need, I'd end up smothering my SO with too much affection. Another way it manifests negatively is when I feel the need to be with someone. I wouldn't travel alone or do things on my own and if I could help it and it has hindered me in some way. \n\nFeelings will dictate the decision despite all logic and rationality cutting across it. For example, I have a very hard time letting go of relationships that reason has already told me is bad for me. I rationally understand that I have to let go and move on, but my feelings...until I get so emotionally exhausted, won't let go. \n\nSo yeah...in summary...my emotions get me in trouble and I wish that I could somehow silence and manage it better. Tough to do. \n\n32 male \n\n\n
6	Procrastination.\n\nSolution:\n\nDo as soon as you think of it. Or ask friends to supervise you onto something you would most likely procrastinate.\n\nSocially awkward.\n\nI have no idea how to fix this, just a slow-burn guy.
7	ENFJ How do you connect with people? What makes you feel like you have a connection with someone	
5	I connect with people mostly trough talking and spending time together,having something behind us so to say,like nice or tough times.\nAlso,nice feeling in the gut , some sense of obligation and trust,its just something i can feel,its a bond that cannot be seen...\n
3	Time and effort from both sides. Takes a while for me to become truly comfortable with someone. Ideally, I have to see someone regular and see enough quality/depth within them to commit to opening up beyond my normal prosocial self. Where they get the real me. This is all achieved through conversation and experiences together. 
3	Through talking. \n\nI feel a connection when you start telling me things that I know are personal to you; and vice versa. \n\nAs much as ENFJs spray ppl with emotions, there's parts of them reserved for only the very select few. 
2	Just having a great time and talking.\nSometimes it's the vibe you get from the other person. It's hard to explain really....I lit just get a feeling and I know 
3	Wanting to move. Help think of places?	Hey guys! I'm a 23 yo ENFJ female. I'm about to graduate from college and trying to figure out where I want to move to. I'm currently living in Texas and want to get out and travel/live elsewhere for awhile. \n\nWhat cities have you found that seems to fit your personality perfectly? I'm originally from California and love SF but it's so expensive that I'm not sure that's realistic for a newly college graduate. I'm open to anywhere though!! Also I was extremely close to being ENFP, but J topped P. :)\n\nThanks ahead of time! \n\n
3	Toronto, because Canada. 
3	I'm a 23 y/o ENFJ with P tendencies, I switched a few countries and cities (Singapore, Russia, Canada, Japan and Korea) and tbh after all these I look for a country that allows/encourages for self-expression with minimum violence. You are young and you probably would benefit from a place where you 1) don't feel threatened and 2) don't feel pressured to adapt and fit in. \n\nFor instance, I lived in Toronto for a while and really enjoyed the polite and encouraging environment that Canadian create for people of all races/nationalities/genders/religions. Toronto lacked the sense of community for me, though. \n\nNow I live in Montreal. It is cheap, and people are very unique. It took me a few years to got to know the tight-knit community of beautiful folks here, and I really feel like I can be myself and feel like I belong. Language was part of assimilation. I hope to spend a few more years here to get to know myself and what I like before I am free to move anywhere without losing myself!\n\nOn a side note, get ready for a journey though when you move. If you want the biggest growth and learning process, pick another country. Having a purpose for moving (example, a university or an art projet) helps a lot to kick start living in a new place. Hope this helps! :) and best of luck\n\nEDIT: I just saw you're into making a music career. What kind of music? Maybe Montreal would actually be a good idea for you hahaha
1	irvine california or anywhere in the OC
1	PHILADELPHIA. Cheap version of Brooklyn, but nicer, and a big community to get involved with in so many ways.
1	Well shit.  I was going to say SF area.\n\nOakland is a lot cheaper, and it's quite charming.
7	ENFJ Depression	How do you deal with depression? Any strategies or advices?
6	[deleted]
2	Frankly I read a lot and talk to a lot o the people on the /depression and /preventsuicide subs and it helps. I don't really have too many friends in real life, so it helps to have others to talk to that are also struggling. It also helps get things out that you wouldn't be able to say to another person you know in real life in fear of baker-act (but that might be more dependent on which state you live in). 
2	I've never been to a professional to get properly diagnosed, so I'm not sure how useful this response is going to be, but whenever I get intensely upset or just feel like I could choke on all the pain and frustration and complete melancholy I'm feeling (basically whenever I'm in a terrible state of mind, which occurs pretty much everyday), I typically just let myself indulge in the feeling. It usually comes at night, so I force myself into bed and hug my pillow and wither inside. If the feelings demand some form of physical or tangible manifestation, I let myself cry, or clench my pillow hard, or write in my journal and not give a sh*t if I'm pressing my pen down so hard it creates a rip on the pages. I usually find that a lot of the negative energy is expelled after all this. The feelings don't go away immediately, but they generally do feel less intense, more manageable, and sometimes just soften into a mild emptiness or sadness. Then I go to sleep or watch a movie or read a book. Something to take my mind off things.\n\nI usually wake up the next morning feeling a lot better, or forgetting the intensity of the previous night. I find it helpful to distract myself with activities during the day. Meeting up with friends or engaging my mind with something challenging, usually. Try finding a place to do volunteer work at. When people are in need of support, I find myself so engaged in trying to provide them with it, that the feelings occur less.\n\nPS: I used to allow my negative energy to manifest in less healthy ways, which is why I advocate the pillow-clenching and journal-writing thing, even though they might sound a little silly. At least they're health[ier] than some other alternatives. :)
2	Texting with an ENFJ. Why sometimes you Don't reply?	I have this ENFJ friend that sometimes text me:\nWhat are you doing today? - and when I reply-\nOh not much, you?\nit goes silent and never answer. What are you expecting with that question? Do you want us to pry?
9	I usually do that without realizing when I remmber that i have other plans.\n\nOr sometimes I text multiple friends around the same time if they wanna do something. Whoever wants to hang out first I tend to accidently forget/not get back to the others I messaged \n\nBut idk if u would just consider this an enfj thing. I'm sure it happens across everyone at times
4	Honestly I never know how to respond to any answer that goes "Ok/not much/how about you?" OP do you have any suggestions? To me it feels like the other person isn't that interested in talking or doesn't have time b/c they're not giving actual info in their answer. \n\nI end up thinking it's not a good time for them to talk and don't feel comfortable rambling about myself if they haven't said anything (ok, how are you? to me means nothing) specific about themselves...
2	The sometimes paralyzing fear of not knowing how to respond keeps us from responding at all.  You may have better luck engaging with an open-ended genuine question.  "What's up" and the like are seen as surface level niceties and as much as we like being pleasant, man, we just want to know how you really are doing and want to share the same.
2	I usually forget to reply when I get distracted or busy
1	Sometimes i just forget,sometimes its maybe too boring for me,you know...not much is not some kind of an answer,but as a true ENFJ i always use it to spark a convo.\nMaybe he wanted to ask you out but something went wrong or unplanned,so he completely forgot about it...hope i helped
3	MBTI/general typology chat for humans looking to meet other humans and discuss MBTI	You don't actually have to be human, it's cool. We have a discord server up for those interested in having some good discussion on MBTI and related topics. Feel free to join in or lurk, whatever you like. Just thought some people out there could be interested in some fun casual discussion and occasional voice chats, if that’s your thing.\n\nFeel free to ask around, some people are pretty well versed on typology and willing to help with typology related questions and such.\n\nAnyway, just thought I’d share the link in case anyone’s interested. 🐐👈\n\nhttps://discord.gg/EYQ9qF8\n
6	On Being vulnerable- ENFP asking about an ENFJ	Ok so I (enfp female)  am seeing an enfj (male). We have had sex but decided to slow things down because he was unable to say I love you. Long story... he said "I love your sex(y)" during sex, and I responded with "I love you" later we had an awkward conversation, and decided to hold off on sex until things solidified.\nWell it has been about 2 weeks since that happened. We still literally sleep together, give each other massages and shower together but he hasn't initiated anything emotionally or physically.\nLast night, we were hanging out and when it was time to sleep he asked if I was planning on staying or going. I asked him what he preferred and he said that he wanted me to stay. While winding down, I asked him to help me gauge the temperature of the relationship and he kind of addressed it in an indirect way... basically saying that he is interested in me and he likes me, but what will be will be and he is just enjoying things day to day. I decided to not sleep the night because I knew I wouldn't get any sleep with that unresolved ending. I also didn't have any clothes or contacts supplies. On the way out of his door we held each other to say good bye.\nI mentioned that I am in a really good place in my life and that I am learning to be ok with being uncomfortable. I held him, looked him in the eye and said, "I love you. It is ok if you are not ready to say it back." We hugged and I joked and said that I needed to express what I feel because it aligns with my values. (Fi joke) he said it was really cool that I could be so open. So any advice? suggestions? 
7	kinda weird because ENFJs are usually quick to decide what they want.  You might have to go with the flow and if a serious relationship isn't what he wants right now, it might hurt you more to wait for his response.  I know when I love someone off the bat, but that's just me
6	As a male ENFJ, I know fairly quickly how I feel about someone and when I do, I'm fairly open about it. "Extroverted Feeling" is the core and dominant function of an ENFJ. If someone says affectionate things, I would definitely return it if the sentiment is the same, one up you even. In fact, i would likely be the first to say it. ENFJs aren't shy about their emotions. \n\nGiven your situation, it seems like he's still deciding on how he feels about you. My tip is to hold back and stop opening yourself to him. When someone comes on emotionally strong, it has the tendency to close the receiver up if the receiver is not ready for it. Seems like this is your situation. \n\nPlay it cool. Let him come to you. Let him do the work. When you pull back, trust me that he'd feel it. His actions thereafter will tell you how he feels about you. 
3	Agree with everything everyone said.\n\nI know very quick if I want to be with someone. So, if he really is ENFJ, this is not so good news for you... \n\nHesitance is pretty atypical of ENFJs who want a serious relationship with someone who tells them "I love you" first!
2	> I asked him what he preferred and he said that he wanted me to stay. \n\nMaybe he could not recognise that he needs time alone to process these life events deep inside, but he said he wanted you to stay because this is objectively nice and he cares about you. Just know this could happen.\n\n> basically saying that he is interested in me and he likes me, but what will be will be and he is just enjoying things day to day.\n\nOh fuck yea he most likely needs some time alone to think through and he doesn't understand it\n\n> I held him, looked him in the eye and said, "I love you. It is ok if you are not ready to say it back." \n\nYou are the best! Thank you. Remind him to accept love without the need to reciprocate. This was the same thing my ENFP bf did. He was the first to be saying "I love you" for one month before I was comfortable within to say that myself. He was also always reminding that he was saying it because this is how he genuinely expresses his love. I learned that I do not have to say anything back, I learned to accept this love. \n\nWhen his words became too overwhelming for me, I asked him to use other love languages to express his love. For instance, gifts or acts of service (read "5 love languages"). This way his less verbal expression of love gave me time, space and freedom to understand how I feel inside and resolve past conflicts.\n\nIn reality, I took so long to realize I love my ENFP because of past darkness and traumas in relationships. I learned a lot of things that closed my heart from others though it always appeared that my heart was open. I hope this piece of info helps. ENFPs, you are beautiful <3\n\nEDIT: so I read other comments... I'm ENFJ who is slow to decide whether I wanna be with someone, so yeah we exist, its fine, give us some space... :P
3	ENFJ careers	Curious about the sorts of careers/jobs ENJFs have?? \nI've just discovered that I'm a ENFJ - it's super exciting because a lot of things are making sense now! I'm not satisfied with what I'm doing for a job and want to shake up my options. What's your career story? 
5	32 male ENFJ: lawyer. Huzzah! \n\nBut I really LOVED teaching. Went to Spain for 6 summers teaching English to 11-12 year old boys at a camp. I plan on teaching a law course once I get more experience practicing law. 
4	I'm a social media consultant! I work with clients to create a social media marketing strategy and develop paid marketing campaigns. 
5	Campaigns and partnerships. I LOVE working in partnerships, each time I'm able to get support for our campaign, it feels like a win and I kind of get off on the feeling that they like me, which is super lame and needy haha but I'll take what I can get! 
2	22, female, marketing assistant! Would love to do freelance social media management when I can support myself.
2	Another comms/social media manager here! Currently studying public relations so looking to head in that direction in the future :)
2	25 male and I work as a behavioral therapist/consultant. Love what I do and love the impact I have on my clients and their family ☺️. Also, I'm in graduate school to become a marriage and family therapist.
2	I'm currently pursuing a career in acting!
1	Currently an IT system administrator and was previously in operations
1	Do something that you feel has value. To you and to society. Don't look for jobs in sales or marketing, go for something that makes a difference on some scale, perhaps something that gives you contact to people. I work in health care and while it's hard work and low pay it's really rewarding. The patients trusts me and listens to me (mostly) and I have a possibility to really make a difference in someones life.

2	ENFP Questioning Possible ENFJ Tendencies?	Hey ENFJs! ENFP first time poster here!\n\nI am curious whether if I am an ENFP with possible ENFJ tendencies. Because I haven't met many ENFJs (as most of my closest friends are INFPs, INFJs, ENTJs, INTJs and ENFPs), I am not very confident in saying this and I wish to explore this more.\n\nI suppose looking at ENFJ auxiliary functions would help me figure out if that is true, but I am more convinced meeting more ENFJs to get a better assessment of that statement. I would also be more convinced hearing from ENFJs about this.\n\nWhat personality traits distinguish ENFJs from ENFPs? What are common trends associated with the ENFJ personality type?\n\nSide question: Is there an ENFJ Discord Group that I can join? I am interested in exploring this personality type further and getting to know all of you guys more! (: Thanks! 
1	You might be better off reading about these two personality types and doing more research then asking this group a question that's a little more focused. The question is dauntingly broad...
1	Look up the different function stacks for both of the personalities. ENFP and ENFJ don't share any functions. In fact they are inversed.\n\n>ENFJ- FE, NI, SE, TI \n>>ENFP- NE, FI, TE, SI \n\n\nCompare the dominant functions. \n\nNE- Do you get excited with new ideas? Does your soul do cartwheels during brainstorm meetings? Do you find it hard to follow through on projects because you are already on to the next better endeavor? (that's NE) \n\nFE- Do you want harmony within groups? Do you find yourself able to blend in with whatever group because you tend to adopt their beliefs to continue the harmony of the group in general? (I'm not the best at describing FE...) \n\nadditonal resources. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgqxNkNx7Vc\nSomething to compare FE (ENFJ) and FI (ENFP)\n\n
2	enfjs why are you so socialy successful?	ok besides the fact that thoery says that enfjs have the best people skills ect,in general all the enfjs i know are socialy successful,they easy with there friends,everyone likes them,they impress people,and have little to no problem in the dating game,....even enfjs with social anxiety overcomes this,?,how?i have so much social anxiety i iwsh i had that thing that enfjs have so i can overcome it,also
9	I dont know man,its just something in me,and im not even trying...somehow i just dont feel bad or anxious when approaching to people or talking to a big group of them,its like an instinct to know what buttons to push in order to have successful contact with others...\nJust think of those things like game,like an act,playing...something fun,use your imagination,try studying people...im sure if you try that you will overcome all your problems,like when little kids are taught to drive a bike,you just let them roll !
6	For me, I just think "oh I could potentially never see them again so it doesn't matter if I make a fool of myself. The ones who react well to my genuine self will be fun to be with and the ones who don't can eff off. I am who I am and if they judge me for something I do, it speaks to their character more than mine and maybe we just aren't compatible and that's okay." It's like the quote *those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind*\n\n\nI also tend to help out whenever I can and enjoy making others laugh and be comfortable. 
2	I agree with what others have said - but I will add on that the "dark" side to this trait/quality of being good in social situations is that a lot of our "relationships" with others are not very deep. They are very surface value, shallow relationships. While we (maybe just me?) have many, many friends and can talk to anyone, very few of them are close to us and are true friends. It leaves a lot of loneliness and emptiness.
2	Be/do/say to others what you wish people did to you. The rest comes naturally.  
2	What does it mean to be authentic for an ENFJ?	INFP here. You said you are drawn to authentic people but what does authenticity look like for you?
12	For me, I like when people are wholeheartedly their weird, quirky self. Not forced or loud weird/quirkiness, but like how everyone in life has their nuances, you share those nuances that make you special in a genuine way. Dance to your own beat in the background and I'll find you. 
2	I would say I like the truth and natural being of a person. I like to be around people who are 100% themselves. \n\nI don't know how to explain it, but I have a friend who tries hard to be liked and acts unnatural in social settings by "being too much" (if that makes any sense). I don't even think twice (a lot of the times) and would call him out to relax or sarcastically make fun of him. When I do, I feel that sometimes it makes him feel bad. It's almost instinctual and I do it because I truly believe that he is trying to be someone he isn't. To me, it is as if he were 100% himself, then not only would he naturally fit in social settings, but I feel that he would be much more at peace with himself as well.\n\nThis is why I prefer people who are genuinely honest and "themselves". And those who aren't, naturally I try to bring the "real" selves from within them by pointing it out to them. I hope my example and any of this makes sense.
2	Be sincere. State your opinions, even if they are unpopular, but tactfully. Do not use flattery. Have some spark of originality (a unique hobby, a personality quirk, a cool fact about yourself or about the world, etc.) that will make me remember you and say, "Oh, I know this guy/gal who knows/does x,y,z!" Don't just follow the crowd, but if you do, then do it because that's what you want to do.
3	Someone who isnt basic and who doesnt fit in the image,ive always liked special girls,those who dont follow society like blind,that she has her own ideas and ideals,can think and say or express what she thinks and feels...many things,no one fake , no one who tries to be just like everyone else.\nThis is my opinion , im just one of many men,some maybe have different thoughts ... if you are worried if an ENFJ will like you,dont worry,just be yourself and one of ENFJs will be attracted to you
7	What kind of Demeanor do you find attractive in (friendships/romantic relationships)?	
13	I tend to like introverts :) \n\nBut as far as demeanour: confident, decisive, and humble. 
9	Authentic 
9	when the other person reciprocates. i fucking love when i'm having a conversation with someone and i can very clearly tell that they're just as into the conversation as i am, and putting in just as much effort as i am to fully draw out the conversation's potential by paying attention to what i'm trying to say and even prompting me along the way / reaffirming me they understand the essentials i'm trying to convey by sorta paraphrasing a point i'd just made so i'd be like, "yes!!!!! exactly!" FEELS SO GOOD.
8	Laid back, friendly, smiley, and when it comes to romance, someone who looks pensive and deep in thought catches my attention.
8	i really like people who are patient, kind and silly! i also have a soft spot for underdogs, i feel like i somehow send out an unconscious vibe that i like to help people and people who need someone to open up to or a shoulder to lean on tend to be drawn towards me, and it usually works out for the best because they help me and teach me a lot too :)
5	People who are able to appreciate, or at least acknowledge, the things we do for them. It brings a high and encourages me to continue.
2	Someone who I can goof around with, and creative!
2	Be chill, cuz I'm not xD
7	Why does the INFJ sub have so many more subscribers than the ENFJ one?	
14	because enfjs would rather be outside than surf reddit. took me ages before i decided to use reddit.
4	Introverts gna introvert
2	ENFJ and INFP	Im just curious on how many ENFJs have encountered INFPs in romantic way,how did it go and what were difficulties for you?\nAny advices for ENFJxINFP couple?\nThanks in advance!
5	Take it slow.  It can be spectacular.  Mold that super ENFJ energy into being a supportive framework; that's #1.  \n\nDo be direct with your intentions.  Do fish them out of their shell.  Do let them recharge (and go back in their shell/bubble).  Do recognize when you need to bubble (and bubble, it's ok).  Don't fix them.  Don't be critical of them.  Don't let yourself become frustrated by their introversion ... learn to love it (it is wonderful).  \n\nWho knows.  With the proper love, respect, and attention you could have something great ... or the devil!  And don't get wrapped around the MBTI axle and become "emotionally autistic".  
1	in one, conflict resolution is great, ideologies are rocky tho
5	I've been told that you guys/gals would make a great friend for an INFJ. PM me if you're interested in chatting.	
3	How to let go of someone?	Dating a guy I really like for the last 6 weeks but through strange circumstances, I cannot continue to date him. He leaves town next week and that will be the end for us. Problem is I am really into him. Maybe not even him, but certainly the idea of him. We are going away for a weekend getaway and I am looking forward to it but also going to crash emotionally when it's over. So my question is: how do I find a way to let him go? How do I stop letting him take up valuable space in my brain? How do I get past the emotional attachment? I want to and I have no doubt he will (he's INTJ). Advice welcome.  
3	nothing much you can do besides letting time process your feelings.  I honestly get over someone by constant distraction.  Dating other people, surrounding myself with people. stuff like that.
2	For me that was always a problem,also getting caught in toxic relationships,but once you break the barrier,everything after that becomes easier.\nSo,to me,time was cure...you will be in emotional pains,you will maybe get depressed , so many things are possible,but one is certain,one day you will get over that person,time will take care and if time doesnt,then some other person that is even better will come by!Hope for the best for you\nP.S Find some hobby,talk to other men,when you start to think of him,try thinking negative or telling yourself "I will not think of *name*",stop reminding yourself and triggering your emotions,detach from everything that can remind you,try passing on those emotions on other people
1	Try reading up on stoicism. It helped me through my roughest patch. 
1	52 days after asking for a divorce from your husband and you had been dating someone for 6 weeks?\n\nDamn. You move quickly.
5	ENFJ and INFP?	I'm an ENFJ female and he's an INFP.  We've known each other through work, for 2 and a half months. I'm good friends with one of his friends.  And recently, I had this moment where I realized wow, I actually really like this guy.  And every since, I've been on the lookout for "the signs".  What I've noticed is:\n1.We have had several 1-on-1 convos about his interests in music and he has asked me about mine, as well as what I'm doing for school in the fall\n2.He laughs a lot when we throw jokes off each other, and has complimented me on my hair and voice\n3.We have spent time with a group away from work and there was closeness involved/ fun piggybacking \n4. He gave me his twitter handle, which apparently he doesn't give to a lot of people. (he doesn't have any other social media)\n\nBut I feel I'm missing something? Like I know he's super friendly, and sometimes I feel special when we're talking, but that's where I'm a little more hesitant. Do you think he may be interested in me?\nWhat do you think should be the next step? Asking for his number and getting regular texts in?
4	Ask to go for drinks/coffee. Something light and see how that goes, if he asks you out too. \n\nAs an ENFJ, I can tell when someone I'm NOT interested in likes me. But I get SO CONFUSED when I like someone - I'll overthink whether they like me or not.\n\nOne thing I did was to instruct one of my friends to tell the object of my affection to slide in an "innocent" remark like "I think he might be interested in you...but I'm not sure, but it looks like it" to plant the seeds lmaooo\n\nSocial engineering is our forte. Go work it. \n
5	lol hurtscientist's comment made me laugh cus it's true.\n\nDo what you want and don't hesitate.  You want his number? Go for it!  \n\nYou like him? As him out!\n\nI'm an ENFJ with long time INFP bf, I was upfront with him and we hit it off!  
10	you sound so enfp lol\n\nenfjs usually just go for the kill
3	As a male INFP, I would say most of this sounds strictly friendly except for the piggybacks. Physical touch is usually a good indicator of interest.
3	INFPs don't spend time with you or make time for you unless they REALLY like you. 
3	As an INFP, I´m saying he probably likes you alot. Even the smallest sign can mean something big. Tbh, to some INFPs, ENFJ are their dream partner we idealize about. Since we do dream alot. Go for it girl!
12	How to be okay with being alone	Hey ENFJs...need advice as per headline: tips, advice, or suggestions on how to be okay despite being alone. \n\nI went to Amsterdam last summer by myself for 5 days and although it was incredible, I couldn't shake off that feeling of loneliness despite being surrounded by hundreds of people. I would always text my friends cuz I need someone to talk to. \n\nWhen I'm alone, I suddenly don't feel as motivated to get through my to-do list and I've this yearning to be with people. I'm not obnoxious and talk non-stop, but I like it when, for example, me and my friends can study together at the library. We're not talking, but their presence alone comforts me. Same thing when I had roommates. Just them being at home made me feel at ease; we don't need to interact, but I really dislike being completely alone for long stretches of time (more than a day). \n\nAnyone else like this?\n\nBtw, I'm 32 male lawyer. This isn't an immaturity thing (I hope). \n\nTL; DR: I just find comfort in being surrounded by people, and feel very lonely without them. Wanna fix this. \n\n
3	I hear you. 32m too, the keyword is hope that you will find your partner (broke up 10 months ago, she wasnt the "one"), but to do that you must take care of yourself, and that includes finishing your ToDo lists.\n\nIm taking a magister next year (dont know the english name) and thats a great way to improve yourself and make friends.\n\nOn your alone time, at least what works for me is watching emotional series. I like anime and things like clannad are great healers of the heart.
3	I think the need for company is a defining element of the ENFJ personality type, so the chances are nobody here will face a similar issue\n
2	Loneliness sucks. I lose motivation very quickly when I don't have someone I know I can go to. \n\nI've always had a best friend to spend time with. Maybe you should try devoting more time to finding and keeping close friends. 
2	 I moved away from all my friends after college and remain in contact through fb group chats.  The chats made me feel like I wasn't alone and eventually I got use to just having me time at home.
2	Nope, not an immaturity thing. F40+ here. I have a good group of regular friends, frequent contact w/family, and shared custody of the little ones, on top of a busy career, and I STILL get lonely! And yeah, it's not necessarily about the quality of the time spent together really; I just like to have warm bodies nearby--a tribe, I guess. I've given up trying to force myself to enjoy lots of "alone time," just "enough" to reenergize. When I travel alone, I just try to focus on soaking everything up... for the people I'm going to share the experience with later, via social media or whatever. Don't let's worry too much about changing ourselves for the world; let's work on changing the world to better suit our needs. How could that be wrong??? Lol... 
1	Hi there! I'm an ENFJ and I used to struggle with this too. I'd call a friend just to come over to watch a movie and crash in my couch and I'd sleep so much better. Could you get a pet? I know that sounds silly but I had 2 cats and having them in the house helped me. 
1	At 27 I struggle with this so much, i usually just send out texts to see which one of my friends i can just sit on the couch and watch movies with.  
1	i'm an istp and I have the opposite problem, I have to figure out how to be okay with being with others\n\nI love this sub because ENFJ weaknesses are my strength and vice versa
1	When I was 22, I moved to another country and lived alone for 2 years. I would not have chosen to live alone, but it was just the way the cookie crumbled.\n\nI really struggled at the beginning, having always lived with friends/family and LOVED IT. But I used the time alone to develop my introversion, if that makes sense? I tried to get accustomed to doing stuff alone.\n\nI also used it to make me get out and do a lot - I travelled with friends and would go to lots of social events. \n\nI think it's okay to need friends and family around, basically, but you may find that with practice you get better at being alone!
1	I used to go crazy spending more than a day at home too. Like, do-impulsive-things type crazy. Now I look forward to downtime alone -- nothing crazy like a full week with zero social interaction, but maybe just 2-3 days of staying at home and sleeping or chilling. I still text on these days, of course. How I managed to get to this point of appreciating alone time is honestly just because I actually got SATURATED with social interaction for days / weeks on end -- meeting new people everyday, having to make small talk repeatedly, only for all of these relationships to not amount to anything more than one-hour-long necessary socialisation (i.e. I'd never see these people again, and even if I did, we wouldn't recognise each other), and just being all-round exhausted by having to move around so much and cater to all these various social situations so often, with no pause in between.\n\nMy advice is to go with the flow. You'll find comfort in being alone eventually -- which doesn't mean you'll love the company of people any LESS, but that it'll just be more balanced!\n\nIf that's no comfort to you, consider this: Is it absolutely necessary to have to "fix" this? Is that the only solution to your problems? The way I see it, maybe you could take baby steps! Try to avoid travelling alone (it's perfectly okay to Not Enjoy something that others seem to rave over; I for one know I would not enjoy travelling alone)? If you're obliged to travel solo for some reason, then try to make a connection with someone to keep you company during your time there? I'm sure there are sites and apps for that HAHA. Like, Tinder, even! I'm sure there are tons of social platforms. Or make conversation with someone at a bar, the old school way.\n\n"When I'm alone, I suddenly don't feel as motivated to get through my to-do list." I used to go to the library or cafes to combat this! Point is, maybe instead of trying to fight it, embrace it and find ways to integrate it into your life positively. Take advantage of it, if you can! :)
8	What are some things that make ENFJs happy?	What are things you do or see that make you happy?
14	[deleted]
5	Love
6	Helping another person through an issue.
4	This ENFJ is happy when: there are future goals set, there are present goals being achieved, there are lots of friends to be with and I know that I am loved.
2	friends, freedom and fulfillment
2	Good night texts \nSincere compliments \nHugs\nCuddling with the SO\n\nJust make me feel like I'm wanted and I add value to your life. That's the validation an ENFJ is looking for. 
1	I love experiencing art with someone I care about and who can appreciate it as much as I do! Which is probably why I have a very select few friends whom I actively seek out to go to the cinema with (I get very immersed in film premises). Sharing experiences with people we love, pretty much -- like travelling with a friend (I say friend, singular, because it feels more intimate to me, I dunno).
8	Fe-Se loop	Good day all you lovely enfjs! I am coming to you today, because I want to help my friend that I know for a long time. Ever since I can remember he was giving me stron enfj vibe, but there was some sort of lack of Ni that always made me questioning my guess (even though this was also what he got in the quiz). And here I am finding answer to my worries:\n\n"- Fe being an extremely adaptable and flexible function means that the ENFJ becomes completely chameleon-like and starts feeling a sense of "loss of self" in the wake of fulfillment of expectations of others. Fe-Se ignores that nagging Ni which wants the ENFJ to stop indulging in such behaviour because over-use of Fe starts giving pleasure. This leads to the ENFJ's bi-polar tendency where they are extremely kind, caring and giving [to a fault] and completely irrational and illogical. "\n\nEven the choice for words is ironic, because we always called the afromentioned friend "chameleon". Did any of you had similar experience and how did you manage to get out of it?\n\nAll answers appreciated!\n~infp
3	Yeah, I get this imbalance when I hang out with friends too long. I don't realise it either. I'm just so happy to do what others would prefer/compromise, that I neglect my self-care activities. It's when I'm home alone that I can focus on myself. Unwind, and give myself freedom to disconnect from others and tune into my inner world. This helps me to reflect on the past and plan the future, which allows me to proof check myself.\n\nActivities that I like/help include;\n\n- having a shower/bath (singing to music also helps)\n\n- washing my face and other body maintenance stuff\n\n- conversely, having a makeup/hair/outfit "play session"\n\n- exercising solo (can't escape your head on a jog/swim/cycle/climb\n\n- yoga meditation\n\n- watching videos, listening to audio, surfing the net without engaging with friends (also includes learning things)\n\n- although I hate it, cleaning my room re-centres me a lot\n\n- reading a book\n\n- lying in the sun to warm up\n\n- writing/drawing/crafting\n\n\nThere would also be other things one could do. The options are limitless, but it had to be on your own, and allowing a certain amount of free thinking/reflecting/pondering space. Other examples might be caring for pets, gardening, scenic walks/rides...\n\nI need a balance of active time, and also time to switch off from the world. I personally have back issues, so I need to stretch frequently, and also I enjoy showering and scrubbing my face everyday. These are things I usually skip when I'm staying at a friend's, because I don't want to take away time from being with them. \n\nActually remembering my balance, and not feeling embarrassed or rude, is my biggest challenge.

6	How would you best explain and describe your type (ENFJ) to a person who knows nothing about myers briggs?	No need to be technical.  I just want to know how you perceive yourselves and others specific to this type.  What do you notice that resonates with the ENFJ personality type? Instead of “traits or characteristics” that are so often used within the Myers-Briggs terminology, I would like to hear examples, stories, and/or perspectives you can offer.  I plan on posting this question in each Myers-Briggs specific subreddit to help foster understanding and create insight through first person experiences and perceptions. 
10	ENFJs are people who thrive in the company of others. Connecting through similar experiences.  The enjoy supporting others and helping others.  They are all about validating the feelings of others and focus on the people around them. \n\nPros: great friend, supporter, empathizer, easy to get along with.\nCons: can be reliant on external validation, become unable to self care because caring too much of others, manipulative.
5	"I am not a religious man, but that doesn't mean I don't have a faith. My faith is that anyone on this Earth can do great things to better themselves if given the right tools.  And in bettering themselves, they better society.  I will wear my heart on my sleeve and I honestly genuinely do care about you, even if you are ambivalent or an asshole.  I choose my words carefully because I believe in being sincere in all things I do.  I thank the waiter every time they come around to top off my water glass, because I am genuinely thankful for the work that they do.  Now, let me know if you want to come over for dinner. I made slow cooked ribs and biscuits with apple crumble for dessert.  Why did I cook all this?  Because if I can't make others happy, I will be unable to make myself happy."
2	this is hilarious when juxtaposed with the istp thread\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/istp/comments/6n313z/how_would_you_best_explain_and_describe_your_type/
13	The most ENFJ thing I've Ever said	So, I work in the military and anyone who has done the same will quickly tell you that it can devolve into high school if the work pace is slow.  My workplace is no exception.  Half the crew seems to resent the newer folks on account that they haven't been betrayed by folks who have since left to go to their next unit.  Others are taking a generally grumpy mood out on everyone.  When I come home, I lament this all to my wife and most of what I say is typical ENFJ stuff. "Why the hell does everyone have to make this shit complicated? Just come in, do the job, be happy, go about your life!"   Or, "And I want these people to do better!  Just... DO... BETTER!"\n\nBut I was talking with one of my NCOs and I think I really nailed a large portion of the ENFJ mindset.  I was again venting about people coming in and being grumpy and I just said "At this point, I'm coming in to work happy mostly out of spite."   Kinda had to share that moment.  Anyone else ever say something that just exemplifies ENFJ?
11	>"Why the hell does everyone have to make this shit complicated? Just come in, do the job, be happy, go about your life!"\n\nI swear I've said the thing before.\n
7	hahaha I relate so much to being happy out of spite. Like when the mood is so dull and listless and sour it annoys me so much and I will put the biggest grin on my face and physically *stir* the energy up in the room by bouncing around and talking to people and getting excited about anything I possibly can. And inside I think, "you people ARE going to be happy and excited damnit."
1	yea i've said the same stuff as well.  I even add how to do better haha people get frustrated sometimes
1	Typical exchange between my staff and I..\nStaff: "I love working when your here, the shift seems to run smoother.."\nMe: "I'd rather work hard durning down time, to make busy time not suck so bad."\nAnother exchange between the aforementioned parties..\nStaff: "The other managers don't make me do this.."\nFast forward to shit going sideways on one front, put that "Ace" in that "Place" and let them see that busy work durning down time is much more palatable than being busy doing extra work that could have been prepped for..\nENFJ follow up, "Don't you wish that you had used your downtime better?  I don't you to do shit to be an asshole, everybody hates coming to work, that's why we pay you to come here.  I ask you to do shit because it makes the job easier, that should be your main goal, do whatever you can to make your job easier, not so you hate it so much."
1	OMG, this is SO me. Less so at work, because of my tendency to want to empathize and be as grumpy as everyone else. But in my personal relationships, sometimes I act like the unicorn pooping out rainbows just because the other person is such a grump! Spiteful indeed. Hahahaha! (I love us!)
1	I work in the military too, and I struggle with office dynamics because we have a TON of Stanleys (from The Office, US) and lazy folks with no motivation. I feel like a chipper energizer bunny most days, just trying to sprinkle my happy dust on everyone through meaningful conversation and pep-rallying IPT meetings. 
9	I love ENFJs!	I'm an INFP and I just want to say that I love you guys! My best friend is an ENFJ and she's the sweetest girl I've ever met! \n\nLove you lots, ENFJs! Just keep being you and you're golden! :) -Lily
5	From an infp - enfjs have a bite as well (still find them irresistible though)
5	For all the ENFJs out there ...\n\nI am sorry for your INTJs exes that sometimes call you while we are drunk.  We should be better behave, but sometimes we just have to tell our ENFJs even if they are our ex-ENFJs that you gals and guys are worth it and you should hear this from everyone in the world and you need to hear it more often.\n\n>Love you lots, ENFJs! Just keep being you and you're golden! :) -Lily\n\nWhat the INFP said.
2	that's the truth :3
4	What types are good matches for ENFJs?	I'm an ENFJ (M-27) and am curious about what types you think complement an ENFJ.  Honestly just from day to day interactions, as a hard F T's come across as cold to me so I feel that a relationship with any T type would leave me feeling unfulfilled.  I know they say that apparently INFPs and ISFPs are good matches. \n\nEdit: Well this certainly elicited quite the response from all the T's, so I feel bad now haha.  I guess just for myself I feel most fulfilled when I'm with a partner that is very gooey and emotionally expressive-no amount of that feels like too much for me.  Don't lose hope though, cause I'm sure some other male ENFJs feel differently.
8	Well, ISTP would have all the same functions as you but in reverse order. Some would say this makes an ideal match. You might not feel instant magnetism, since as you say we come off as cold a lot of the time. \n\nBut once you get to know someone with a personality dual really well, apparently it never stops being amazing. \n\nI don't think I know any ENFJs in real life, this is just a hope I cling to. 
4	if you're willing to risk then ISTP. If you wanna play it more safe then INTP. 
4	F/28 INTP who fell hard for a slightly younger M ENFJ about two years ago, and it's by faaaar the deepest,  most intimately comfortable relationship either of us have ever experienced, and barring some earth-shattering catastrophe we're looking forward to making that commitment (presumably) lifelong.\n\nWe're both intelligent, deep people and I think the gender swap works to our favor (as opposed to M-INTP/F-ENFJ, though still perfectly viable). I'm absolutely fascinated by his passion and warmth and I love watching him do his extrovert thing. I don't at all mind it when he gets heated or sentimental or anxious or gushy.... we've never had a serious fight (which is a little worrisome), because even when emotional we understand each other well enough to locate and resolve the issue long before that.  I'm not a very verbal person at all so I mostly communicate my affection through gentle touches and random texts, and he absolutely understands the significance of each gesture without continual explicit expressions. On the flipside,  he constantly marvels at my patience and understanding when other people have grown exasperated with his emotional/clingy/capricious nature, and yet somehow he doesn't tax me at all.\n\nThat being said, I know several ENFJs I definitely could never be in a relationship with, because sometimes I'm that standard,  elitist NT and those ENFJs just seem so shallow and dull and overly dramatic for no reason. Sooo... this is definitely a case by case basis, but sometimes it's rather surprising who resonates with you spiritually and intellectually.
5	I think it's a common consensus that ENFJ's go well with INFP's.  Mostly because of the NF portion they both can express feels  and connect with one another.  They  compliment one another how they handle and process things, and how they react to things too.\n\nMy INFP bf and I have been together for about 2 years *which is a record in my book*. I love him to death and honestly we have a great level of conflict resolution, that when we do fight about something it's over something real small.  We usually argue about cleaning up the apartment or who's turn it is to cook, and that's usually when we  are both stressed about other things in life.  In my book if the biggest worries in our relationship is trivial stuff like that, we are doing well in resolving bigger issues.
4	INFP ENTP ENFP INTP - I find Ne Fi/ Ne Ti the most comforting
4	>Do opposites attract?  Not always! Tieger and Baron-Tieger (2000) found that Idealist-Idealist pairings have an average satisfaction rate of 73%--the highest attraction rating for all the NF pairings, and almost the highest possible satisfaction for all pairings. \n\n>-Idealists were 73% satisfied with Idealists.\n>-Idealists were 64% satisfied with Rationals.\n>-Idealists were 51% satisfied with Artisans.\n>-Idealists were 46% satisfied with Guardians.\n\n>One further thing that should be noted here is that the Idealists reported a broad range of satisfaction compared to other types.\n\n>-Idealists: 46% - 73%  (27 percentage points of difference)\n>-Artisans: 52% - 73%  (21 percentage points of difference)\n>-Guardians: 58% to 79%  (21 percentage points of difference)\n>-Rationals: 52% - 65%  (13 percentage points of difference)\n\n>Compared to other types, the Idealists appear to have the most to lose if they make a wrong choice. \n\n\nI think it's interesting to think about I'm going to cross post a comment I wrote in the ENFP subreddit. I'm using an ENFP perspective because that is what I am. \n\nThe common belief is that ENFPs would benefit the most from being in a relationship with an INTJ because they are opposites. I am an ENFP and when I have been with an IxxJ I have found that the other person grounded my dream like nature and pressured me to take care of daily chores. That is good for an immature ENFP, but To truly mature and become a functioning adult, one should take on responsibility out of self care, not pressure from your partner. \n\nSince then, I have matured and found systems to organize myself and become more aware of my Si and need to self care. When the reason you do chores is external, it isn't true responsibility. Especially for an ENFP who wants to take care of others, the realization that you do chores as an act of self love and self care was a big revelation top me.  I think being single helped me develop this connection. I couldn't have come to that conclusion if i didn't spend time living alone and single. \n\nI don't need someone to ground me and "make me responsible" the only way to be responsible is to do it yourself. I also don't want an introvert who I constantly have to coax and encourage to socialize. Although it can be rewarding to see someone else grow, it stumps my own personal growth because I can't explore the avenues and new ideas that I'm interested because i'm too focused on growing someone else.  What I desire is someone who is also an extroverted dreamer, someone who I can encourage and brainstorm with, someone who has their own projects to do while I can focus on mine. \n\nI am currently starting a relationship with another NF. I have found that communicating clearly and with fair but firm boundaries have helped in my journey. Of course nothing is perfect, but I think I am on my way to finding a partner who encourages me to explore think of possibilities and connect with the outside world in his presence and without his presence. Take note that NFs with other NFs have a wider variance in satisfaction, if our dreams or value systems match it could be really good, but if they don't align it could be really bad. That makes sense because if we are talking in the language of ideas and emotions those ideas and emotions should align, otherwise we will both be clashing heavily. \n\nTL;DR: NFs should consider other NFs, the idea that the opposite personality type would balance you out and "make you responsible" is a cop out. You are the only one who can develop your self care habits and routines. As a typical dreamer I want someone who encourages my dreams, not grounds them. Grounding myself and taking care of day to day chores is my responsibility not my partners.  \n\n\nSource: http://oddlydevelopedtypes.com/ENFP\n\nhttp://oddlydevelopedtypes.com/ENFJ

3	As a fellow ENFJ, I've always found ENTP's to be some of the greatest people, or at least most complimentary. Their tertiary function is Fe, so they're more inclined than a lot of the other T's to be very (for lack of a better word) giving. This adds to the charming personality that is typically associated with them. Additionally, their dominant function is Ne, which is really interesting to explore the differences between that and Ni, which is the auxiliary function of the ENFJ. On just the letters alone, I think I work best with other extroverts in a relationship because we both have similar preferences to amount of socializing than when I've been with introverts, but that's in my personal experience. Also, sometimes it's nice to be with Perceivers, as it can often balance out my hard J. 
2	I've dated 3 ENTJs, INTJ, ISFJ. \n\nI think type has really little effect on my chemistry with each of them! It's useful when we disagree. Haha.
1	I keep bumping into INFP guys. Out of the 4 relationships I've had in life, 3 have been INFP. The outlier was an ESTP. \n\nWhile I had very loving relationships with the INFP's, 2 of them lost interest in the relationship. The other one we were together for so long that we loved one another still, just not romantically.\n\nThe ESTP was verbally and physically abusive.\n\nI think I mesh well with ENFP's and INTJ's really well though. In any event-- no more INFP males for this girl.

2	Does anyone know...	if a discord server exists for ENFJs? I know there are large ones like typology and MBTI but there are groups for specific types like INFP. Is there one for us? My peoples!
2	All types in this discord: https://discord.gg/GFkmuzX\n\nI've met a handful of ENFJs, always busy here.
1	Want to start one? :)
2	This is a bit weird...	Hi! I'd always type as an INFJ or INTJ depending on how I feel that day, but I usually type as an INTJ. Today I did a mbti test and a cognitive functions test and both came out with ENFJ. It's weird, because I'm a relatively reserved person, shy ( in uncomfortable situations) and I have social anxiety. As I read more about ENFJs, some points fit me and some don't. Am I typed incorrectly again or is there more to it? Thank you in advance! <3 
6	I think ENFJ's are prone to social anxiety because we care so much about what other people think, and are sensitive to how others react to what we say and do. It's easy for us to reach out to people and make new connections l, but we care too much about everything and it becomes painful sometimes. \n\nHow easily do you get lonely? If you learn something new and interesting, do you file it away in your memory, or do you IM it to a friend who would appreciate it? \n\nI get lonely quite easily, and I feel like the tree falling in the forest with no one to hear it, if I have an idea and no one to share it with. 
2	Type doesn't change and tests are unreliable. Read up on the cognitive functions of the types to learn which type you are.
3	Help! my openness and willingness to communicate and understand my partner is pushing him away.	Sorry this is long but I could really use some advice.\n\n35 year old ENFJ gay male here. I am currently dating someone i've known (loosely) for a decade. A year ago we started dating and have been together since, aside from a short break early this year for about two months. \n\nSince reconnecting we have had a lot of intimacy and have been working at a slow pace to reconcile and really make things work. Everything has been great except for our communication at a distance; texting in particular is a frustrating experience.\n\nI sometimes text and don't get a response for hours on his days off or I receive a text and interpret it in a tone other than how it was meant; (perhaps because i'm a little put off from the sometimes long delays between responses). This leads to me feeling de-prioritized and under-appreciated. I feel like its so simple just to reach out and let someone know you care because that is an action that seems hard-wired for me.\n\nHe has expressed my communication is a bit much for him. I think of him often and I love the conversation, so to me its natural and harmless. I like to be as open and communicative as possible and usually text once or twice through the day aside from good morning/goodnight stuff. He's expressed not wanting to feel obligated to say hello in the morning or goodnight in the evening and I take it personally because for me these things seem like a natural healthy form of communication in a relationship. He has expressed reading it as insecurity and I feel the most secure about myself I've ever felt in my adult life so we don't agree on that. \n\nAt my age, I have grown to understand that I need a certain amount of care and affirmation. Rather than be ashamed of that or look at it as weakness, I accept it as a part of who I am.  I know my partner is capable of loving because he is fantastic in every other way, particularly when we are physically together. The missing component seems to be when we are apart. He just doesn't care so much for communicating and I have a hard time not taking it personally and giving him space. \n\nOn the 4th of July, after an amazing day together we wondered into deep conversation and he confessed that he's uncertain he can be the guy that can give me the attention and care I deserve. I feel foolish to want to see this through further but that is just my nature and I genuinely love the guy. Any advice on what I can do? I realize that if we never see eye to eye on this I could end up hurting myself or feeling resentment for putting my needs aside. I've already cut down on communication and i'm seeing that he doesn't reach out often on his own which makes me feel a little hopeless about moving forward. Any advice would be appreciated.\n\n(Note: No, I do not know his personality type. I passed him along the test last night and didn't want to push him into taking it. I will ask him later)

4	Hey! I feel you! I'm so sorry! I've been there! I feel like this topic is the curse of the extrovert in a relationship. \n\nMy partner is super introverted and I noticed a while back that me poking and prodding and expecting communication (especially digitally) was causing a lot of unease in the relationship. For us extroverts we need that sense of connection and that's where we get our energy from and that security that we seek in relationships. But look at the other side of the coin. A lot of what we as enfj's need/enjoy actually drains people who are more introverted. Now imagine feeling drained by things like that and then having your partner expect that from you everyday. I think it would be a bit stressful. My boyfriend also gave me the "I don't know if I can be the one to give you what you need" talk and that scared me for sure. What helped me was realizing that I love my boyfriend and that his only "job" in the relationship was to be loved. So even if he didn't act the way I wanted him to (being more communicative, more extroverted) I would just love him and not expect anything. Just love him as he is. \n\nIt's like when people say, "Oh you complete me...you make me whole." I don't like this idea. Why can't we be two whole and complete people on our own and just love and respect each other? It hit me that in my life I'm the ONLY person responsible for my own happiness and it isn't anyone's job to "make me happy". It's my life and the people I have in my life didn't sign up to make me happy. I'm happy as a result of them just being a part of my life. Does that make sense? \nSo when I needed more contact and socialization, I sought it out in my other relationships (friends and family) and once I was "recharged" I found it much easier to just love my introverted (at times not communicative) partner as he is and I've gotta tell you, it has radically changed the dynamics of our relationship. I'm happy with my life, he's happy with his and we are a lot happier together with all of that pressure gone. And he actually does give me more attention and affection now than before and things are a lot easier now that I'm getting my own needs met. \n\nIt was a bit hard for me to let go of control in the beginning but it does get easier. This worked for me, I don't know if it would work for you but it's something to chew on... all the best! I hope this helped in some way! \n\nEdit: just wanted to add that when our less than extroverted lovers don't give us 24/7 undivided attention, it doesn't mean that they don't care or love us any less! Even if it sometimes feels like that! 
3	\nGay ENFJ male in my early thirties here. \n\nWhen I read your post, it seems to me that the issue is not communication in general, but communication when you are apart. I am dating an INTJ and he isn't very good at communication when we're apart. He needs an incredible amount of alone time. His love language is "acts of service" and my preference is for words of affirmation and physical touch. We've been dating for about 5 months now and we're starting to get on the same page so I am excited to see the potential of an ENFJ-INTJ match. \n\nIf the issue is just communication when you are apart, I think you should just toughen up and accept that he will be slow to reply or not respond at all. For my INTJ, he wants purposeful communication, not just shoot the shit type of texting. Many times I've waited for a "goodnight text" that never came. As an ENFJ, I love receiving texts and emails, even if they're just to say hi, but for many people, it's too much to deal with because of all the other responsibilities we have in life. Accept that you need more affirmation, but more importantly, that not everyone craves emotional connection the way we do. \n\nIf the issue is communication in general, this would be tougher. You might be dating a Thinker who is not comfortable being so emotionally open at all times. You say that he loves you. If you require more than that, then he is right to be concerned that he may not fulfill your emotional requirements. This isn't a character flaw on either party, just a mismatch. I understand that open communication is second nature if you're dating someone, because when I'm thinking about someone, it's so easy for me to just say "hey I miss you how's your day". But in reality, MANY people just don't operate like that. \n\nI don't have a specific advice, but only to say that you need to decide: if the communication issue is just when you're apart, toughen up if you think that the relationship is worth it. If the communication issue is persistent and across the board, time to revisit whether you should stay or leave. \n\nAll the best. \n\nPs: search a video by Dan Savage, "the price of admission". It's helped me. \n\n\n\n
1	I am a straight female, so maybe my thoughts here are irrelevant, I don't know - but you basically described exactly the relationship I had with a boyfriend before I met my husband. I told him I needed to hear from him every day and he told me he could only text me once every 3-4 days. I don't have a happy ending to my story for you though because it didn't last..but I did meet my husband shortly afterwards and realized what a perfect partner he was for me for many reasons including he actually wanted to talk to me!\n\nI'd highly recommend this book.

7	ENFJ description by Victor Gulenko (Socionics EIE "Hamlet")	
2	I have a hard time believing socionics. It seems to go into a lot more detail, almost trying to specify exactly what a specific type it like, compared to MBTI that is a little more broad, because no two people are alike. I for into maybe 40% of those characteristics. \n\nMaybe someone can explain why socionics is so popular? I'm more worried for people reading about other types, because it would be harder to find out what is true and what isn't, and make far worse stereotypes than MBTI tends to make. It can be fun, but I don't know how accurate it is. 
2	Hoooooly shit that's crazy
5	enfjs and social sparring?	i noticed types with ni fe in there stack are extremly good at reading people,insutling ,and artistic expression.i mean when it comes to fighting with words enfjs tend to be the best,and can just about put anyone down,so how do you guys relate to this?,are you good at insutling or fighting with words?
6	Yup.......the pen is definitely a sword.......
4	Enfjs are annoying, they even out talk and jest me when I'm having the conversations in my head!
3	Yes. We can learn your deepest, darkest secrets, sometimes off of very little information, because we love to listen and empathize and you've always wanted to share with someone as empathetic as us. Unfortunately, that means that we then have  really, really sharp weapons at our disposal should we ever feel compelled to use them against you (we rarely ever start a fight, but if we feel attacked, we will sink the ship and take you with us).  Of course, I'm just talking in generalities here; this isn't about me at all.  Hahahaha!
2	Yes this is usually true.  Sometime to the point tv / movies / media has to turn the ENFJ into a parody, aka Frasier Crane and his tv show, or Darkwing Duck.\n\nLots of this type of humor is how "witty" / "sharp" the ENFJ is with their combination of Ni and Fe, how they are energized via being around people (and thus trading those quips), but also pointing out how this can lead the ENFJ into trouble or how they often create messes that affect them and the other people around them even though the ENFJ says they hate doing this, DRAMA seem to follow the ENFJ often for while they hate drama, they also want to be people who create proactive harmonious change.\n\nNote this is not limited to ENFJs, for example ENTPs are often good at this.  Strong Ne, strong Ti (to keep the joke on point and tight), but with Fe in the 3rd spot they took can be nasty with their disses and such.  And unlike INTPs the ENTP like the ENFJ is energized via this encounter when there is an audience.
2	Yes, but only if the person to be impaled with words truly deserved it i.e. The ENFJ is ready to burn that bridge. 
2	I'm definitely good with words but I'm too sensitive to put anyone down. 
2	enfjs the most intuitive?	im going to go on a limb and say enfjs are the most right brained and intuitive,why not infjs?or enfps?,why not infjs?, while first although infjs are more in touch with ni they also use ti more so it probbaly makes them a bit more logical.why not enfps,tho nfps would seem more right brained i dont think they are in the raw sense of the word. because internaly they have fi and si,si is detailed oriented and fi is a judging function and a judging function forms conclusions by putting the peaces together, so internaly they are logical minded and concrete,externaly maby with ne they are more right brained but ne is not as deep as ni so ne would think more in logical terms than ni would,..........so enfjs what do you say about this do you often grasp concepts without words or logic?,do you think you right brained?,since you have fe do you think in feelings,and does it sometimes get so abstract and non logical,and non verbal that you have to consiously bring yourself down to using ti to ground you more in logic,this earthly 'relm' and more to the concrete?
13	[deleted]
4	Every type is intuitive, just in different ways. The reality is also that every function has both a left brain and right brain component and if you use one side of the brain and not the other you can't function at all. So I would say you should rather ask how special the enfj intuitive ability is and what makes it so special. In short your dominant functions work in the background and are mostly aiding functions in the abstract sense. They give you the ability to read people and absorb their emotions, they also help you to predict the future. With these happening in the background you can get busy changing things to the way you want them to be. You say that nice or nasty thing, depending in what effect you want to cause. You can look at a problem out of the box and visually go through a solution. In that sense you are incredibly intuitive. However, things get a little shaky when you have to be particular about what you are feeling in isolation, or having to look into the depths if the soul to get ti the core workings of a person. You also have a very poor intuitive approach to the immediate physical reality and things like playing sport can be draining. Or accessing precise memories if things that happened or details that you just can't remember escape you. In those things your intuition is quite poor and some other groups excell in them. MBTI shows us not that we are special, but that we need others to form a better society, that we all have a role.
2	I my experience INFJs learn about others for themselves. ENFJs learn about others for humanity's benefit. ENFPs seem unsure about where they're going. Or open, however you want to word it. I think in both. I just have a easier time explaining my feelings than I do my thought processes. 
7	ENFJ anxiety Tips?	I am a very anxious person, and I've never really received any advice that has thoroughly helped me. Any advice from the people with a similar mindset?
7	Fighting the urge to put everyone else's needs first and taking time to really focus on yourself a bit is helpful, too. That and exercising regularly.
4	Mindfulness.  Apps like headspace or sonicfocus(EMDR) may help as well.  
3	L-theanine. Helped me get through the worst of my grief after my brother's suicide.
3	In terms of anxiety publicly, the best advice i've taken is to confront your fears head-on. For example, you can enter the room and be fearful of what others think of you, stand against the wall and be inside your head or you can push yourself out into the crowd and be social. The discomfort of forcing yourself social can be liberating once you realize there's nothing to be afraid of. ENFJ's are naturally social but that doesn't mean we don't have our hesitations. I frequently have trouble with anxiety in social settings and find that I can break though it immediately and get back to my natural comfort zone when I take control of those feelings and make the first move. \n\nIf you're speaking about anxiousness and internal anxiety (overthinking, having a difficult time calming your thoughts) what has helped me a lot is really simple breathing exercises and/or meditation. Find a focal point either inside or outside of yourself completely unrelated to the topic at hand. Designate an amount of time to spend on it and commit to that thought process. Its amazing the clarity you can gain in just 5 minutes a day. \n\nI think for ENFJ's in particular our growth and our breakthroughs come from these times because we're so often focused on others that we don't give ourselves the same attention. \n\nAlso, I like what @justmegan said in the first comment. If you're into exercising, the benefits are so good for this sort of thing and few people realize it. I hope that this helps!
2	Neurochemistry is kinda my thing...
22	You guys have a little heart on the subreddit name/description, I think I already love you.	Sorry if this is brought out a lot (that is, posts that tell you how awesome you are, I'm new here so I don't really know), being a bit down and looking for wholesome groups on Reddit I thought "what could be more wholesome than a group chokefull of ENFJs", and that little heart already made my day.\n\nSo, well, thank you.
3	cheer up!
2	I'm sorry you've been feeling down. If you need to talk to someone you can message me any time :-)
5	ISFP problem with ENFJ's	This is a repeated issue I've had with ENFJ's.\n\nEvery ENFJ I've met we hit it off, pretty much right away. We just click. They're usually the kindest people I meet as well. \n\nHowever, for some reason we never go the distance. All ENFJ friends I've had, at about 1-3 years in, will just suddenly drop me, and lose all contact. What's weird is that it's not like we fight or anything. There's no huge argument, where they leave, it's just one day out of the blue, they'll be like;\n\n"It was super fantastic, knowing you. You're an awesome person, but I'm sorry to say I have to leave now, for X, Y, and Z reasons."\n\nThe last one claimed she was dropping me because she felt bad that she had gotten a job, and it kept her too busy to spend time with me, even though I made it clear that I didn't mind if she, and I could not talk as much.
4	I'd have to echo what someone said above, that ENFJ's place a HUGE importance on relationships, and so we invest a LOT into them. What's an easy conversation and just seen as "clicking" to a lot of people is to an ENFJ a game of social chess that we're usually pretty good. We love talking about your interests, we love getting people to open up, we love connecting on a really deep level with everyone we meet. But we have a tendency to do that with EVERYONE we meet. I've had small breakdowns to my BF more than a few times because I'll tell him I feel so overwhelmed socially and I don't even want to talk to anyone. I'll have a combined 15 people messaging me through snapchat, facebook, and text message and I don't feel ready to be able to have those same types of thorough conversations with each. \n\nWhat stuck out to me was you saying that you made it clear that you didn't mind if she and you didn't talk as much, (as long as you continued a casual friendship, you know, why drop off completely?) It's because ENFJ's live and breathe that intense, tight "click" connection with people. It's really hard for us to be casual acquintances. That's why whenever my boyfriend responded to my little freak-outs with, "well why don't you just give them sentence long responses?" I don't do that lol. It's not "impossible" but that's just not me. The reason these people got so close to me to begin with is that I never gave sentence long responses, I care about other people and get passionate about my relationships so I invest time and a LOT of energy into them! But when life circumstances drive me further from some people and introduce new other ones, I literally don't have the mental / emotional energy for everyone to keep up that same level of discourse
3	my case I don't talk to my friends for a while but still catch up when we do make time for each other.  I just had lunch with a friend I haven't seen/spoken to in 2 years.  My high school buddy was studying abroad for 4 years, but we'd chat as if no time has passed at all.  Sometimes life gets in the way and I forget to hit people up.  You can try to hit up your ENFJ friends and see what they are up to.  Just because they haven't reached out doesn't mean they don't want to catch up again.  If the case is they no longer want to be friends, it might be because they might feel like they don't have a connection with you (be it in terms of personality, interests, or phase in life).\n\nI sometimes forget to hit up a few friends when I'm in an area, because I only have so much time allocated to visit a certain group of people.  I feel bad about it, but sometimes it happens.
3	I don't know you personally, but I'm ENFJ (36M) and my partner of over 10 years is ISFP (31F) so maybe something here will ring a bell. Also, generally speaking I find myself abandoning more and more relationships as time goes on so maybe your friends are similar.\n\nWhen I'm with people it's SUPER important to me that we get along and find common ground on most topics. I make a big effort to talk about their interests, avoid sensitive topics, be flexible with scheduling, do things they enjoy, and so on. This can be taxing and is rarely reciprocated, which often makes relationships exhausting. I personally have enough friends but few that I'd call close friends. The few people I truly love hanging out with just make things easy - they like talking about big ideas and are never offended, they take plans seriously (don't cancel at the last minute or show up way late), and we can just hang out wherever instead of having to plan some fancy event excuse to meet up. \n\nMy ISFP gf and I get along great though. She's artsy and has taught me a lot about aesthetics and design - it's like magic when she points something out that doesn't quite look right and can actually articulate why. On the other hand she often propels conversations by disagreeing or giving counter examples to what I say, or she believes things because rules or experts back them - these hurt my brain.\n\nOr maybe she's just busy. Or maybe you're stinky or something... :)\n\nHope it works out for you though, you -S-P types are awesome and underappreciated!
2	i also had an enfj friend who suddenly dropped all connection with me im an infp,now i think it comes down to they are extroverted,so perhaps they looking for a more social type of person,i tend to be very shy and quiet around people,so perhaps he would rather just hang out with more gorup type of gatherings and forgetting about you,....like if you perhpas sit by yourslef while there are  agroup of friends interacting i think they would rather be by the group
2	Yeah, I'm going to repeat this idea about how we tend to give 100% in our relationships with people and for me at least, I put other people's needs in front of my own ALL THE TIME. When something comes up and I have new projects or more work I feel really guilty for not being able to devote that amount of time and attention to my relationships and it feels almost selfish of me to put anything else in front of them so I would rather just cut contact than disappoint or not be there for somebody the way I had been in the past. I know that sounds silly and I'm trying to not live in such extremes but it's really hard. We are an intense bunch and it's kind of an all or nothing thing (for me at least). But it's not personal! 
5	Any other ENFJ's have trouble w/journaling?	I've read so much about the benefits of journaling, in all sorts of contexts, and would love to keep a journal... of any sort!  I keep thinking it would be so interesting to read my present-day thoughts some day in the far off future when I'm a completely different person.  But for some reason I always get writer's block as soon as I'm staring at a blank page.  It just recently occurred to me, after many hours pondering my ENFJ-ness, that it could be because "self-introspection" when I am completely by myself (physically or mentally) is really, really uncomfortable (selfish maybe?), kinda boring sometimes, and... just feels forced for some reason.  OTOH, I Love having conversations with everyone and anyone, and (almost) each and every exchange leaves me with some important/useful/interesting insight about my self.  So... does that mean that I should just scrap the idea of journaling entirely? At least in the traditional sense?  On the one hand, it makes sense to me.  OTOH, I'm not too thrilled with the idea that I just don't have the innate ability to be introspective in the absence of another person to trade thoughts with.  Anyone else with this issue?
2	I used to blog my thoughts online when I was in college.  I also wrote a journal commemorating my first year with my bf. xD now I don't really write much because time.  It does really help to verbally process your thoughts, and I think with every person it's how people prefer to process.  Some through art, some through voice and some through pen.
2	The way I had to approach this, and I am glad I finally did, was to treat it as I am "talking" it through.  Which did it for me.  I really like the "Day One" app for iOS/Mac (web version is beta) and it does what I want.  I'm certainly not a daily journaler.  Sometimes I go days or even weeks without journalling.  But on a day I can end up with 5 or 6 entries.  When I was much much much younger I'd have had an easier time believing that I'd rather be punched in the balls (spoiler ... I'm not into that :P) than journal.  \n
2	I set up an email account that I will email my journal entries/daily writing to. It seems to work out really well since I know that the security won't be compromised and so I'm far more open about what I write. I can also type almost as fast as I think so it's nice in that way too.\n\nI still do little notes/entries in my bullet journal when I want to remember something specific.
1	I feel like I am more able to journal online. Like my thoughts flow better. \n\nI still somewhat write like I have an audience in my paper journal.. I hate self introspection but I do it because it does help me think out things. I can't expect someone to want to listen to me talk everything out. \n\nPractice might make you better at self reflection which is an important skill to have in life in order to grow as a person. Journalling is a forced project for me, but I have found that my negative thoughts are a little quieter if I write them down. 
5	ESFJs, I have a self-care app prototype I want to show you!	I've been designing a self-care app for FJ types, and I've just finished a prototype. I'm looking for folks that could user test for me today. Participating is very easy, and I would greatly appreciate your input.\n\nReply to this thread or message me if you're interested in checking out what I've been working on!
1	Sounds interesting, let me know if I can help 
1	Could be interesting. Sure.
1	Sounds interesting! Let me know if you're still looking for a guinea pig :D
1	Little late, but I'll definatly give it ago if your still looking for people.
1	I would really like to check this out!
1	Yeah! Give us the info! :) 
4	which comedians do you think may be ENFJs?	I asked this a while back in the main MBTI page and no one really said anything. 
1	Jenna Marbles imo but not sure

1	495
1	4w5, 479
1	641\n\n6w7-4w5-1w2
1	Never knew about Tritypes before, just did the test and got the following:\n136/361/613
1	1w9 146 if I remember correctly!
1	4w3-6w5-9w1
1	469/649/946\n\nI didn't even know these existed. Interesting! 
9	How Good Each Personality Type is With Forgiveness	
1	Super accurate for ENFJs from an ENFJ.
15	Oh shit. Am I ENFJ?	So it's odd.\nI would always test INFX. In doing so, I would answer the questions as how I would prefer in that situation.\n\nToday I took the test as what I actually do and it came up ENFJ.\n\nI hang out in the INFP sub a lot and I always say I'm either a very organized INFP or a very emotional INFJ. And as I read everything and consider it... I think I'm just an ENFJ.\n\nI know I'm mostly extroverted but prefer to recharge with a token person or solo. I am totally 110% a feeler. Perhaps to a fault. And until today I didn't realize that with P versus J the difference was that P's sort of like things open-ended and J's like decisions. Absolutes. I love absolutes.\n\nSo I read all the things about ENFJs and it's the first time any type has really resonated with me. Also, I was reading some posts and I'm like yeah! That's me totally! Where as on both the infp and infj subs I have been like... Nah, that's not my experience at all.\n\nSo basically I'm saying hi. I'm a new kid here. And ya might see me posting around these parts. 
7	I would say this was 100% my experience as being a ENFJ. I would always test as a INFJ, which my roommate at the time was, and thought I was better at talking to people than she was. Turns out! Not an INFJ at all! Haha
5	Nice one! :) Hello!
5	I'd say taking a test over time is likely to be more confusing than helpful, ultimately. \n\nI tend to test as an ESFP, which I am most *definitely* not. \n\nFinding descriptions that really resonate is a good sign for starters. \n\nWhen you have some time, give [this](https://youtu.be/yTUBOgWtzsk) a watch if you haven't already. This guy's typology videos can be immensely helpful. \n\nEdit: it seems I'm attracting bots....
3	I'm just having this realisation myself. \n\nI've thought I was an INFJ for about 14 years and since coming out, I had been really puzzled by my own behaviour. I think I tested as introverted because I was trying so hard to hide myself. \n\nI realised at the turn of the year, that my life was more isolative than I wanted so have made a good effort to make more friends and socialize more. I'm acting the clown a lot and really enjoying it, and love dancing. I was not life this before at all, hiding away with books. \n\nI was very lonely but back then I was more driven to avoid people due to anxiety. Now I would gladly be around people all the time. I feel great after a good session of socializing, more loving, more joyous about life.
2	NAH, istp.
7	ENTP here, Just wanted to say you guys are awesome people	
9	No, you are
6	Let's debate about that.
3	Awww, I'm glad you think so. How have things been for you recently?  Do you want any tea or coffee or water? I baked up a lemon cake yesterday. Here, have some.  Don't like lemon? It's okay, I also made some banana bread. Yes, I bake a lot.  It's just nice to bake for other people ᵒᵗʰᵉʳʷᶦˢᵉ ᴵ ʷᶦˡˡ ˢᵘᶜᶜᵘᵐᵇ ᵗᵒ ᵗʰᵉ ᵉᵛᵉʳ⁻ᵖʳᵉˢᵉⁿᵗ ᵗʰʳᵉᵃᵗ ᵒᶠ ᶜʳᶦᵖᵖˡᶦⁿᵍ ᶠᵘᶜᵏᶦⁿᵍ ᵈᵉᵖʳᵉˢˢᶦᵒⁿ ᵃⁿᵈ ˡᵒⁿᵉˡᶦⁿᵉˢˢ

1	Hmmm. I'm an ENTP and I've always kinda found ENFJ to be sort of an antagonistic figure to my character... passionate emotional thinkers. Struggle to make the tough decisions when it comes to a time of emergency. I just feel like we clash a bit.
1	you are so wonderful!
1	ENTP's, you're really amazing too <3 :D
4	Pointers on how to apologize?	I broke my best friends trust, and I'm meeting her tomorrow to apologize. I don't know what to do or say, please help? Also, ISTP here
8	2 more points to add on to what everyone else said:\n\n* Nothing short of an unreserved apology. Yes: I am sorry for all I have done. NO: I am sorry but have you considered that X is also equally at blame?\n\n* Focus on your actions, not hers. Yes: I am sorry for doing action x y z and hurting you in a b c ways. NO: I'm sorry you felt offended.\n\nHalf assed apologies piss me off LOL
7	just say you messed up and you're sorry.  tell her how you understand how she must feel and go through the feelings she must be experiencing. mention how much your friendship is important to you and whatever it takes you'll do your best to try to regain her trust.
3	I think, no matter the type, all meaningful apologies have the same outline. \n\n1. Acknowledge screw up. "I'm sorry I did/said ____. It wasn't my intention to hurt your feelings" (if you had good intentions state them here. Ex: I'm sorry I told your teacher you were sick, I was trying to help the situation, but I was mistaken and I betrayed your trust) \n2. Don't assume or expect things. "I really value our friendship and want to continue being friends. Please let me know what I can do to help you. Maybe by ____ or ____"\n3. Have an action plan. "In the future if _____ happens again, I am well equipped for it and I won't betray your trust again"\n\nSource: helping my ISTP friend apologize and navigate it. He found the whole script thing helpful and helped him put his thoughts into words, in the right order. Dunno if the same goes for you, but hope it helps. Good luck with your buddy! 
3	Very good stuff here.\n\nJust want to add that you shouldn't say "I'm sorry you reacted/felt that way about it" or anything similar. That isn't apologising for what you did, but suggesting that it's the other person's fault for feeling a certain way.
2	Ever since reading about the four part apology, I enacted it with myself and my kids. Here is a great explanation :\n\nhttp://www.cuppacocoa.com/a-better-way-to-say-sorry/
2	Sorry for being the party pooper (sort of), but depending on their type and how exactly you broke your best friend's trust your friendship might never be the same as before. Just giving a different perspective and sort of preperation for a possible negative outcome despite all your efforts based on my personal behaviour. I'm pretty forgiving, but if someone breaks my trust on a level of my core values (for instance a partner cheating on me) I would immediatly break up with them.\n\nBut hey, good luck!\n\n(Also, <3 you cuddle bears in here!)
14	Do you ever give your all for too long?	Just ended a little over a year long relationship with an ENFP. After some time I realized that I blinded myself for the majority of our relationship. I gave a lot of myself, not really expecting much back other than mild affection or words of encouragement. Now I realized that though I did not expect much back, not having love given back to me absolutely burnt me out. I did not want to socialze with anyone, I was anxious at all hours of the day, and I was just so so sooooooo tired. \n\nFor some reason I continued to fight for our relationship thinking I could somehow fix or save it. It wasn't a "bad" relationship, or so I thought. I saw all the good parts of my SO moreso than his bad. \n\nNow, I realize that for so long I gave, and gave, and gave, until I had nothing left to give of myself. His bads absolutely outweighed the good, but I was somehow blinded to that fact. \n\nAnd honestly, now that I think more about it, I've noticed that I have done that in past relationships, however not as bad as this time. \n\nIs this an ENFJ thing? Have any of y'all experienced this? 
8	I just want to say you're not alone... I just got out of a 3.5 year relationship and I feel like I could have written this. \n\n> I gave a lot of myself, not really expecting much back other than mild affection or words of encouragement.\n\nThis was always, always a recurring issue in our relationship. I felt like I gave everything, but I couldn't even get -- exactly what you said -- mild affection or words of encouragement (my top love languages) back. I would gently bring up my needs and he would "try" for maybe 3 days before stopping his efforts. (I asked why he always did this after we broke up, and he said he would just forget to keep it up. Reading into it, I wasn't worth the energy.) I felt like I had to change my expectations, and all of the responsibility of the relationship fell to me. Just like you, I kept thinking there was a way that I could fix it. Something else I could sacrifice or do to keep him happy...\n\nBecause my emotional needs weren't being met and I was constantly carrying the burden of maintaining the relationship, I, too, was burnt out. I have anxiety and panic attacks, and my "episodes" occurred almost every other day  from the stress and mental exhaustion. However, exactly two months later and I have YET to have a panic attack since the breakup. I never realized how toxic he was, how much his cold, literal, over-analytical self brought me down. (I've been described as warm, enthusiastic, witty, and empathetic, like most ENFJs :) I defend our relationship by saying we balanced each other out, but sometimes things are just *opposites*, and not in a good way)\n\nHe's not a bad guy, not at all. But through his own admission, he was lazy in the relationship. And because I love(d) him, I gave him my all without much in return (for YEARS). He just... he finally realized and told me on that fateful day that I was too good for him, too good *to* him, that I sacrifice too much, and I deserved to be with someone who loved as passionately and as intensely as I do.\n\nIt's strange to be single after such a long time (first week of college 2013 to the last month of college 2017), but it's exciting to meet men who have similar personalities and actually be able to flirt with them! I'm not ready to date yet, but it's nice to know that there are others out there. \n\nI was a mess after the breakup and I still have bad days where I miss "old Andy", but time really is the healer of all things.\n\nI hope you're doing well, OP! I'm sorry this turned out long; it became kind of cathartic for me. You will be okay, and you will find someone better suited for you in the future. Stay strong!
7	It's that blurry line between ENFJ and codependency. Give freely and love freely; but find a healthier balance for having your own needs met. 
6	yea, it's something i've done and still do.  It's draining and can be somewhat unhealthy if you forget to do things for yourself instead of others.  Just know how to take care of yourself before you try to take care of others
3	oh my god i can relate to this so much. especially the feeling of not really noticing how much you're giving and giving and then one day finally taking a step back and seeing the big picture. i feel like it's hard to remember to keep yourself in mind, especially when you're so into the other person and all you can do is think about making them happy. it's so tragic bc it makes enfjs super easy to take advantage of bc we're so blindsided by our love :( 
3	An annoying ENFJ. Need help understanding	So, I'm an ENTP and generally I love hanging out with ENFJs. It's all fun and you guys are great friends. I recently met a co worker+friend who has been very annoying. I was shocked when he got typed as ENFJ.\n\nWhat's annoying is that he lies... a lot. Also he denies everything about himself. He's a flirt but he denies that. He tries to hit on any girl he meets whom he thinks is remotely good looking. He denies that too. It's not that he's shy or blushes. He just isn't himself around anyone, not even close friends. I think this is especially annoying to me because we  ENTPs are frank and don't care if that hurts but denying things that everyone knows for sure is just plain annoying. \n\nAlso, he has a lot of theories which have no solid evidence at all. These again, tend to be about girls and what they want and what they like. If anyone tries to tell him he's wrong, he just calls that person weird or something along that line.\n\nI'm not trying to find a solution or anything. I just want to know from ENFJ POV, what makes u guys think our behave like this(if any of you have. I still don't ENFJs behave like this). I can't wrap my mind around the fact that he's ENFJ especially since ENFJs I've met before this are really awesome.\n\nOpinions?\n
6	1) Tests are inaccurate and a person's results are not everything. Cognitive functions wise, is he really Fe Ni Se Ti?\n\n2) He does not sound like an ENFJ — isn't himself around people, does not understand what the objectively or universal feasible ways of "getting girls" are, is completely unawares of how he is coming across to other people. ENFJs are hyper aware of these things and it doesn't seem like he is, at all, to the point where he is disliked by others. I hesitate to type him.\n\n3) Even if he is indeed an ENFJ, sucky people are everywhere. ENFJ =/= good person. MBTI tells you little about a person other than what cognitive processes he prefers.
3	TBH whether someone has issues or not can be universal and not related to type. (Perhaps how they MANIFEST might be related to type but there is no "Angel" or "Asshole" types)
2	I'll give this a shot.  Take the quote of the week, over in the sidebar.  Let me guess.  Your ENFJ friend would go "awww... so true!"  You, ENTP, would go "absolutely false statement! take that fugly person over there for instance!"  Your ENFJ friend would then respond with a vague "you're weird!" while secretly thinking "how could ANYONE not believe that kindness=beauty??? Tragic! Ah well, everyone is valuable in his/her own way, I guess, so why argue over nothing?"  and walking away.  Meanwhile, you're secretly thinking "seriously??? WTF; what a faker! Clearly he couldn't dispute the hard evidence (fugly person)!"  Amirite?   Thing is, your ENFJ friend probably isn't being fake.  You ENTP's just can't relate to our view of the world/people.  Your T and our F are like ships passing in the night and forever will be.    
2	I'm an ENFJ with an ENTP friend and I think he is extremely annoying a lot of the time. \n\n>I think this is especially annoying to me because we ENTPs are frank and don't care if that hurts but denying things that everyone knows for sure is just plain annoying.\n\nYeah, he probably thinks this too. Overly judgmental and assigning negativity to everything. \n\nFrom his perspective, he might not be flirting. He might just be being nice. He might not be "hitting on" these girls, he might just be talking to them and getting to know them and being humorous with them and he might genuinely think they are nice/pretty/cool and worth getting to know. \n\nIs he trash talking them behind their backs, purposefully hurting them, cheating on them, etc.? If not, what is it about his behavior that is so wrong? Why do you feel the need to be negative and judgmental about it? \n\n>Also, he has a lot of theories which have no solid evidence at all.\n\nYou value rationality and evidence and logic above all else. We don't. It's not that we are not capable of those things (we are, and will beat you on it when we have to use it, in class/the lab/etc.), it's that we don't think they are the only ways of interpreting the world. "Introverted Intuition" is a little bit like magic. You won't believe it, you don't even want to hear it, you'll dismiss it as irrational. But, it is how we come to our theories and conclusions and worldviews and it works very very well for us. 
2	We don't necessarily have to have tidy surroundings as long as we know where things are. We need order in a non-physical sense. We need concrete answers and plans for the things that are important to us. 
1	He's not necessarily a liar.  ENFJs are notoriously misunderstood by personality types who can't understand that we honestly just love people and we love interacting/helping them. I've been accused of being flirtatious but really I'm just friendly. I genuinely like people. Most people pussyfoot around when they like someone which is why our natural demeanor seems flirty, but when I'm actually interested in someone, it's obvious. I have zero qualms with telling someone how I feel about them. Granted, ENFJs do like pretty in general, so we'll be more sociable with people we find attractive. But if the intent is there, we're upfront about it. \n\nAlso, who he is with you isn't necessarily him. In fact, it's probably not. We adapt to our audience because we want meaningful interactions without conflict. So we find out what you're about and work with that. Learning is important to us and we want an unhindered flow of knowledge and understanding from all parties involved. \n\nWe don't need to prove our instincts to you. We've been studying people our entire lives. I can describe and accurately type people I've never actually met because the database I have to draw on is... extensive, to say the least. We trust ourselves because we know we can and although we're not going to start a fight, we're not going to say we're wrong when we're not. We'll find a way to smooth it over or move on. \n\nIn my experience, ENTPs are prone to exaggerations. So you may notice a few things you don't understand and all of a sudden he "lies about everything."\n\nIf he's actively hanging out with you, he's aware of how you feel. He just finds you interesting and wants to learn fromyou so he's giving you time to see that he's not fake.\n\n
1	To be fair, we have our evidence. We're people watchersand we gather information from the little nuances other people miss. It's not magic, we're just charismatic Sherlock Holmes types.
4	Just an INFJ passing through. I've heard that INFJs are one of the more social introverts (i certainly am) so now I'm wondering... what are the main differences between "eNFJs" and "INFJs".	
13	INFJ here dating an ENFJ. We are very similar but there are a few key differences. One thing that stands out to me the most is that he's a lot more diplomatic than I am, more eloquent than I am, and more charismatic than I am. He's really gifted with putting his thoughts into words. I'm a much more raw and straight forward speaker while he is so eloquent and puts things in ways I've never thought of before. \n\nHe's a lot more selfless than I am and he will do anything to make his loved ones happy. ENFJ'S are very selfless people I think this attributes to their first function being Fe. While I'm a pretty selfless person as well it's not quite to his level. \n\nI also think ENFJ'S are more in tune with their sensory surroundings. My ENFJ likes to be out in nature and exploring.. While I'm perfectly okay with being inside for a million years being shut up. One thing is for certain though that ENFJ's are definitely introverted extroverts\n\nI think ENFJ's are easily our sister types... It's hard to see the differences sometimes but they're there. 
4	Actually, please someone answer this. I've noticed myself getting quieter over the past year, especially after conquering some social anxiety that plagued me for the first few years of high school (And I talked a lot to try and reach out of strands of a friendship). And I would love to know the difference. 
2	ENFJs tend to be more ready to take risks/ be impulsive.\n\nIn contrast, INFJs are more contemplative and need to really think their decisions through before committing to it. It takes awhile, and when the decision is made, there's nothing anyone say that could change their minds.
2	Also, the lessons we learn from each other are invaluable. My INFJ taught me how to truly love and be comfortable with myself without outside influence, and I brought her out of her shell and helped her understand how amazing and wonderful she is so that she's comfortable interacting with others and looks forward to and initiates social interactions. 
1	The INFJ's in my life are so incredibly cool. Private, intelligent, well-researched in their areas of interest, and always somewhat unaware of how funny they are. 
1	My heterosexual lifepartner is an INFJ. You guys absorb information about people for yourselves. We absorb it so we can share it with everyone to make the world a better place. You guys are more likely to share your views online, but can sometimes lack our level of diplomacy due to the medium. We're more likely to disperse our knowledge through face to face conversations which allows us to read the other person's body language so we can tailor our message to something they can understand. \n\nINFJs and INTJs are my favorite people. Hands down. You guys won't let us seduce you until you understand our intentions and for us ENFJs, being truly understood for the "Protagonists" we are is an amazing gift. 
1	You know you're a good egg if you're friends with an INxJ. ;) \n\nOh, and I noticed that INFJs are really only introverted around people they aren't comfortable with. My INFJ and I were inseparable when we lived together. I only let her go when she found an ENFJ guy I knew could take care of her and love her as much as I do. 
29	if you're feeling down, please read this	Hey fellow ENFJ's! I found the most amazing comment on another forum that really lifted my spirits and I wanted to share. It's by pinkrasputin over at personality cafe, I'll link to it at the bottom.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"Okay, this is long overdue and I really need to 'fess up. I tried post a different thread to you but I think what I was trying to say was in it's feeble stages. What I really want to convey is how grateful I am that ENFJs are in the world. ENFJs are absolutely wonderful people and I'm not sure you know your gifts to those around you. I think you have an "idea" but I think you like things "confirmed" by others. So here it is. Forewarning: I am very emotional and honest about this so expect this to be a long post.\n\nI think I am more than qualified to boast about ENFJs' sensational qualities. After testing for type, all six of my very closest (physical real life) friends are ENFJs. These are males and females. Plus, the father of my child (marriage lasted 8 years) with whom I still remain friends is also an ENFJ. If it wasn't for the ENFJ, I honestly don't know how I would make it through my life.\n\nDo you know how beautiful and how charming you are? Do you know that wherever I may go, a party or whatever, you manage to find me and approach me? You extend your hand to me in friendship and love. You take risks at being my friend and you are so loyal to me once you do. You see the good in me when I don't see it in myself.\n\nYou have such strength. You go through your life and see the good in others. Yes, sometimes you get hurt and don't understand why there wasn't "that connection" because you felt it so deeply on your end. All I can say is that "I'm sorry". And you've wasted your time on many people that were not even worthy of you. That is usually when you call me and I will listen forever. I will listen to all the pain you are suffering or have suffered. I will help you see things "in a different way" so that you can feel good about yourself again. I have absolutely no problem doing this. That is finally my chance to love you back. \n\nIt's so sweet. You always want to make sure you're doing "the right thing", that you did it "nobly". You love to "report" to me how you handled different situations. I love hearing it. We encourage each other, right? I will always validate you that you did something right. This is not because I'm into blowing smoke up your ass. This is because the reality is : You care about others and "doing the right thing" WAY more than most people on this planet. You have a good heart. I help you to trust in that. I want you to trust in yourself and to be able to need validation only from yourself.\n\nYou know you're physically gorgeous, right? I mean I know you are HOPING that you are. It's scary to reveal your insecurities. But you can relax. The reality and truth is: You ARE gorgeous. It doesn't matter when you get too skinny, too fat, too young or too old. There is a beauty you posses that will always be. Trust me, I've seen it. My ENFJ friends ages range from 21 to 56, I've seen you all through many stages and you ALL remain gorgeous. Do you ever age? Lol.\n\nIt's okay to have this wonderful "physical gift". Who is it better bestowed upon than persons who equally match that with their insides as well. You know you confuse people, right? You are so attractive, so intelligent, you are so open, AND THEN what you give emotionally!!!!!!! Do you know how that blows people's minds??\n\nThere is no other personality that is better suited for me when it comes to friendship, contact, and communication. We both can call each other at any odd time of the day. We both don't get offended if one of us has to 'go' all of a sudden. We just "get" each other. We can go long stretches without speaking to each other. We both know what that's about. We are both extraverted and have our hands in "lots of pies." We both get "busy", but then when one of us calls the other and we finally make "contact", we can talk for hours and quickly go to an emotionally deep level as if we've never left each other's side.\n\nYou ENFJs keep me "in line". No, it's not by you demanding it. I stay in "line" because I am inspired by your efficiency in this world. You have this fine balance of "taking care of business" and "loving those around you." In fact, you're AMAZING at this capability. You are wonderful, loving role-models. When I want to give up and do nothing, you show me how I can undertake EVERYTHING. When I want to turn around and throw a tantrum at the person who just hurt me, you show me how to convey the message more appropriately. Lol- THAT is your biggest gift to me. But I guess I tend to do the same for you. It's just easier giving the appropriate advice when you're not the one being hurt I guess. Why do we feel such a symbiosis with each other? \n\nFor some reason, you all ask my advice. Do you know how much of a self-esteem booster that is for me? People that I think have it together WAY more than I do, seem to crave my every word. And then when I give it, you love me for it. You're so sweet. I think you understand that I need to give too. \n\nI know it's hard for you to ask for compliments. You are ALWAYS complimenting me. But it is so charming to see how I can turn your day around when I give you compliments. No, my compliments are not "fluff". You really deserve what I tell you. And you look and sound so wonderful receiving compliments. I don't know a better group of people to bestow compliments upon. You become so honest, so child-like. A big smile spreads across your face. You give hugs with a resounding "Thank you". You always manage to express thoughtful appreciation. \n\nMy ENFJ friends have all been "aunts" "uncle" and of course "father" to my daughter. Even though I've cut out extended family, my child has a full "family" because of you. \n\nThank you ENFJs. You have inspired me to no end. I owe much of what I am today to you because you believed in me when I had no idea there was even a seed of worthiness within. Thank you for always "being there" when I lock my keys in my car. Thank you for helping me with planning. THANK YOU FOR BELIEVING IN ME. Thank you for taking the time to explain.\n\nYou are wonderful people. You glow and your are a beacon. I rarely have negative incidences with you. Even when I have become frustrated with an ENFJ, it can't last that long. Because in just a short amount of time you manage to do something amazing again. \n\nSeriously, other divorced people drop their jaw when they witness the caring and cordial relationship between me and my ex husband. But neither one of us is good at being "mean" anyway. So we laugh at the world in all their "meanness."\n\nENFJ, No one understands me like you do. And I ALWAYS feel accepted by you. Please love yourselves dearly ENFJs. Your kind of love saves people's lives. I mean it."\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttp://personalitycafe.com/enfj-articles/11275-why-enfjs-incredible.html
9	Wow this actually made me tear up. Thank you for sharing. 
5	This really made my day 😭. Thank you so much for sharing this!!!
2	I needed this today<3 :)
2	<3 <3 it's nice to hear someone appreciates us tbh! I've been used by people all my life :( 
1	JESUS THAT FELT SO GOOD
1	This was amazing! As a newbie here, I find it insane how much we ENFJs are alike. Thank you!
1	how do i change an ENFJ's perception of me?	
9	Change your perception of yourself (they can smell your emotions)
1	If you mean "fool" them then fat chance, they can smell fakiness (assuming they aren't overidealizing and even then that wears off with time.)\n\nWhat exactly do you mean by that?
1	Chances are that the ENFJ sees you when you can't see yourself. I can't count the number of times I've explained to people how I see them to their dismay, only to have them thank me later for my perspective and suggestions. We understand what's going on with you, even when you don't. 
3	How best to Get help for eNFJ mother	My mother (ENFJ, F49) has gone through a lot this past year. My father (ISTJ, M53) recently underwent a major surgery but has always been a lackluster partner to her (they stay together for cultural reasons). My sister (ESFP, F19) and I (INTP, F22) have been performing poorly in school due to mental health problems. My mother has been supporting us through all of this in the ways that she does best.\n\nThe problem is that I can see her mental health disintegrating. She often becomes snappy and mean when confronted with minor things. She also makes wildly contradictory statements when trying to advise us. She's always prioritized everyone else above herself; subsequently, she's neglected her physical health as well. She has friends and family in her life that would like to be there for her and look out for her but 1) she refuses help from others and won't confide in people and 2) they are beneficiaries of her kindness and don't really push her to help herself.\n\nI'd really like for her to get into therapy and it's not logistically impossible. She can afford the best help out there but she just has to make time for it. What's the best way to nudge an ENFJ toward self-care? Sometimes it feels like I'm trying to argue with the sun.\n\nAny help or insight would be much appreciated. I have a lot of admiration for you guys.
7	1) Show love and appreciation to her. No freakin' therapist in this world can compete with the love of her own family. She probably feels alone at home, because her family members have to be taken care of rather than can take care of her. Prove to her that you can.\n\n2) Encourage her to hang out with her loved ones - friends? Other family? No amount of therapy can fix an ENFJ's unhappiness if we are returning home to loneliness anyway.
1	As an ENFJ receiving therapy the best thing I could recommend from a psych standpoint is cognitive behavioral therapy. I already know what I should be doing to take care of myself but the hard part is making myself do it. CBT breaks it down to small, manageable steps with homework of sorts that holds you accountable to taking care of yourself. It's made all the difference in the world for me.\n\nETA: I also really like the app called Booster Buddy, though some people may find it a bit childish. It challenges you to do three acts of self-care every day with different difficulty ratings depending on how you're feeling. You earn coins to buy little outfits for your animal buddy and it's really cute and good at starting the momentum needed for self-care.
1	I get the feeling that most ENFJs have had some sort of trauma during their formative years that's taught them that looking for help is useless. We understand how painful that is so we try to do anything we can to help others. \n\nShe needs an INFP or an INFJ. When she's helping others she'll feel better. 
1	Also, it'll frustrate her if you don't come to her for advise and she has to yell at you from the sidelines. If she's being snappy, she's feeling disrespected. 
3	enfj and social anxiety	hey u guys. i was wondering if any of you deal with social anxiety as an enfj?\ni think i might be mistyping myself, i used to be very typical enfj in my childhood and youth until i developed social anxiety due to isolation. i lost most of my friends and i have been trying to fight it for years now. the idea of being a social butterfly is so so appealing to me and i miss being like that, but on the other hand i seem to dislike everyone that i meet and whenever i am around people, even if its just at work, i crave being on my own. sometimes i wish i'd never have to leave the house, i just really really dislike being around people and it makes me sooo anxious. but also i am so torn because i really want my social life again and i would do anything to have it back. do i sound like an enfj with social anxiety? im sorry this post is a mess but i'd appreciate any comment <3
5	Can't confirm if you are ENFJ but can confirm that ENFJs can have social anxiety, need to be alone, etc. I briefly suffered from depression after graduation and wouldn't leave the house, the longer I was in the cycle the worse it got and I would dread having to go out. Having Fe also meant that I was more aware of social awkwardness, maybe to an extent that others would likely not pick up on, and that made me even more anxious. Perhaps being ENFJ makes it worse / harder to overcome? I can be done though... After initial anxiety, my natural ENFJ social butterfly comes out and I end up enjoying myself, as I can still have situations where I'm unsure about attending something but it's fine when I eventually do. 
2	This reply might be a bit late for this post, but hey. I'm an ENFJ. I'm extremely social- served as public relations head for a youth organization; had a background in theatre; and briefly worked as a personal secretary to a business dude, who's life is literally "work hard, play hard." Two years ago I went into isolation, was always just in my apartment with my boyfriend. All I needed was inside those four corners- my boyfriend, my dogs, and my computer. I didn't need to go out- both work and school were now done online. Those two years have completely changed me- slowly I became uncomfortable outside. I started hating being in a crowd- the pandemonium of noise stresses me. I also began to feel left out when I was with my friends- the only thing in my head was a countdown till I'm home again. Things turned for the worse- I had an attack in a public place,and was rushed to the hospital. They checked me for everything but they didn't find anything, so I was advised to go to a psychologist. A panic attack they said. So yeah, I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder. Have been taking meds since the panic attacks are extreme and unprovoked. I lost a lot of friends because I didn't wanna meet up and bond. I kept the diagnosis a secret, because I was ashamed... how can an ENFJ, a social butterfly, ever end up in this state? I was ashamed to tell my friends and family of what I become, it's too far away from who I was just a couple of years ago. \n\nJust this year I am trying to embrace it. I want to accept that I'm a socially awkward ENFJ who has an anxiety disorder. I just want to accept me, and have friends who will accept the new me. \n\nThe point of this long reply is that YOU SHOULD ACCEPT WHO YOU ARE. ENFJ'S can have anxiety, and most of the times is because we are afraid to disappoint others of who we become. We are anxious because we know we are uncomfortable, but we don't want that friend or stranger to feel awkward too.\n\nThe social charm of an ENFJ will always stay there, so don't worry. However, if you really want to turn your social life around, you have to first accept who you are. Then take little steps outside your comfort zone. Don't aim for your past social life, that isn't you anymore, it will just stress you out. \n\nPick one or two friends and tell them the truth about what you feel. Promise you, it will feel so much better getting this out. Then ask that friend to hang out with you every now and then. Pick a place where you will feel comfortable- a movie night at home, drinking some lattes in a quiet coffee shop. \n\nThen once you feel comfortable enough, increase the difficulty. Try going to somewhere new and a bit less comfy. \n\nDon't push yourself, you have limits and should embrace that, so take this slowly. Make a schedule for this little "trips" and stick to it! Aim to do this at least once a week.\n\nFinally, keep a journal! Write how you feel. This will totally help you, I promise. The format that I use is this:\n\nDate:\nLocation:\nDegree of Anxiety: (Rate it: 1 is lowest, 10 is highest)\nWhat are you doing?\nAre you alone? If not, with whom?\nThoughts before this situation:\nDuring situation:\nAfter situation: (usually I cheer myself up that Ive survived the situation)\nWhat would you suggest to yourself for improvement?\n\nEvery time you are feeling uncomfortable again, just read this journal. Reminding yourself that you have accomplished similar social situations will make you feel more confident that you can and you will. :)\n\n\nSuper sorry for this long reply but I hope I have helped you! Please tell me your progress if you can! :) I'm also just training myself to go out and be with other people, so I know your pain. Hehe, and I promise it gets better! 
8	How do you Deal with all the hatred out there?	I quit FB a little while ago because the amount of animosity and hatred that I was seeing was getting ridiculous.  I knew to expect to occasional nationalist racist/xenophobic post from certain relatives.  However, it got more disheartening when I saw similar posts by friends who I love and care about from the other side of the political spectrum.  It really wrecked me to see the people I love use their anger as an impetus to say these insanely hurtful blanket statements about major swaths of society.  It also hurt me when I would make a post asking for input regarding a controversial topic.  I would post that I want to learn more about transgender issues and identity or that the claim that racism is institution-based and thus PoC can't be racist arguably undermines their agency in their own communities.  I honestly had no agenda and wanted honest discussions and the friends that I *love* as family just blanked.  People that I KNEW would love to have these conversations just balked at the first (erroneous) hint that there was an ignorant agenda at work.  I trusted them and through their inaction they told me to kick rocks.  As a result, I walked away from FB and moved onward to Reddit and Instagram.  \n\nInstagram is great because I could just share a dumb pic of me cooking and there is nothing more to it.  It is mindless and fun if I wanna blow off steam by showing people back home what life is like where I am.  But now I find myself on reddit a lot and as much as I find great subreddits (like this one!) I also find some really hateful subreddits.  T_D, EasternSunRising, Incel, etc.  Inevitably, I'll stumble into one of these subreddits and my morbid fascination will get the better of me and I will want to learn more of why these hateful people are the way that they are.  And as a result, it really fucks up my general mood to know that there are such large communities of people out there who feel this innate hatred.\n\nSo, how do you deal with it?  How do you manage knowing that there are folks who will never know a wide range of joy and love because they have devoted so much of their life toward irrational hatred?  How do you not let it fuck you up on an existential level day in and day out?
3	Hank Green once referred to this as the "age of outrage." It sucks and he elaborates on it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgNSTBDEV4U \n\nI think you will *not* always feel this way about your friends, the Internet, and maybe even about Facebook in particular. Maybe un-saturating yourself (so to speak) with content from your community will help with this (I love Instagram!). \n\nThe key word I used there is *community.* If we went looking for these things in real life–when we seek out KKK neighborhoods or Marxist protests or that old drunken uncle we all have–we would see a lot of this innate hatred and feel especially wounded because it would be *in our community.* Right in front of your face. But the Internet and social media just *hand* this stuff to you. \n\nNo longer does anyone have to go looking for outrage, because it's all around them–just a Google search or a scroll through the comments section away. It doesn't necessarily mean there's MORE hateful people; they just get around a little easier. And it feels horrible to you and me because when it shows up on our Facebook feeds or search results, *it feels like it's in our community.* Like it's literally right in front of us. \n\nThe angry Marxist protestors end up in your suggestion box because they're looking for someone who has their ideas and values. You probably do the same sometimes, and I definitely do (by, for example, following and linking people to the Green brothers). The Internet makes this a lot easier. \n\nI think the congregation of angry people on certain subreddits and forums can feel bad because it suggests that users just circlejerk each other into being angrier and angrier. But that's not necessarily true. We don't know how those angry Facebook people are exposed to alternative viewpoints in their lives. We don't know how they are when they're not online, or when they *really* meet someone who is vastly different to them. \n\nFurthermore, I'm hearing your betrayal regarding your friends' silence, and I'm sorry for it. I'm almost positive that they didn't mean to hurt you. Can you mention this incident to any of them?\n\nI think you should focus on yourself here. You're doing the right thing: don't let the outrage get to you. If you want, respond to blanket statements with politeness and openness and QUESTIONS. I do this a lot with my conservative friends (as a pretty liberal person) and they either a) tell me something interesting or b) they get mad. If the latter happens, I stay polite and they usually apologize later. No one is perfect, and I make those same sweeping statements all the time!\n\nThat's my last thing! Outrage isn't sustainable. It's a state of mind, not a state of existence. No one did anything good being mad at each other, even if all great movements start with a little frustration. No happy person is like this forever–sometimes angry people deserve (and want!) some sympathy. Sometimes they want to make you feel as bad as they do so that *someone* will understand them... or so they hope.\n\nBuilding on that, try to imagine your friends and the rest of Facebook with complexity. The Internet is crazy, man.\n\nI hope this helps!
2	I'm really failing at it these days.\n\nActually unsure if I should continue to be an idealist and defend idealism, or just take a break from caring for as long as I can successfully distract myself.
1	I hear you & share your Frustration. I too have quit **FB & Twitter** all together. The promised of social media has back fired. Instead of bringing people together into a higher consciousness (original vision of internet); S.M. has descended into the pit of hell, it became the ultimate platform to spread Hates, Lies, Rumor, and Fake News around the world. \nI don't consider Reddit a Social Media but a news gathering site for topic I'm interested. I unsubscribe from hateful subreddit like r/politic and concentrate on r/enfj for example. 
5	I want to know what self-care is like for eNFJs	Hi there, I'm designing a self-care app for FJ types in the Myers Briggs system. \n\nI'm an INFJ myself, and I really care about doing this project right. If you could share your thoughts on this survey, I would appreciate it immensely: https://goo.gl/forms/witvsfsiwK7rsMJz1\n\nJust fill in what you feel like answering. Everything is anonymous & I don't ask for any personal info. Any little bit of insight helps. Thanks so much!!
3	Took it. Great questions! I thought a lot about myself. 
2	Sounds interesting. I'd love to beta if you get a test flight or something. If not, lmk when you launch. 
3	Sad cinimon roll	I ..... oh god .... I need help I guess . I feel very misunderstood by the general population. I'm sure at some point you guys will dig it out of me but it's basically about work and past work experiences.I haven't had a boss that has liked liked me and I know your boss isn't supposed to be your buddy.  I often feel singled out and picked on though on top of just been an  ENFJ I also have ADHD and OCD combination disorder.it makes it extremely hard to function properly and high stress situations with changing variables.I excel in organization in preplanning. My employer knows this about me and makes a point to criticize and makes me feel in adequate as a person ( you just do not have the ability to do xyz... you'll never be able to 123) . I don't struggle with communication or making aquantencies with co-workers.\n\nHas anyone else struggled with cohesion with their employer ? \n\n( yes I'm looking for another job, please don't give me advice on how to communicate better with my boss.)
3	Did you just call yourself a sad cinnamon roll AND misspell cinnamon??? 
1	[deleted]
1	I read what you have written and you feel that are in a bad situation, it is true what you feel.\n\nGeneral population are either XSTJ or people under the influence of XSTJ, and XSTJ are the opposite personality to ENFJ.\nSo, there way of dealing with reality in a materialistic manner and there grip of past conventions are really unneeded. So, you might struggle with most people and this is the case. However, as ENFJ, you might like seeing potential in people and helping them turn their potential into tangible outcome. And if you keep building a wall to separate yourself, you might miss on the chance of meeting non STJ who will understand you and appreciate you for who you are.\n\nSome people have low self worth and they try to undermine other people so that they can feel good about themselves. An example is you boss.\n\nI am an INTP and since the moment I started reading about personalities, I have been fascinated with XNFJ and especially ENFJ, I wish that I can get the chance to help you even more.\n\nJust remember, Your personality is so rare that is needed in society.
7	ISFJ in a relationship with a possible ENFJ but I'm having anxiety issues	Hello. I am an isfj male 23yo. I was in a serious relationship (for 2 years) and broke up a year ago. Now I am in a new relationship but I don't feel very connected with her like I was in the previous one. I do really like this girl and want to see things through but somehow I feel that there is a barrier that prevents us to connect on a more deeper level. We've only been dating for about a month if that helps and she is 19 years old. \n\nSome background story on my previous relationship: the girl was an ESTP I believe. Bottom line was that towards the end of the relationship, she wasn't too eager to hang out with me anymore and preferred spending time with others besides me. I later found out that she had been cheating. \n\nSo I guess my concerns are:\n\n1.) I find it hard to fully trust my SO now even though I know that she's not the same person. I always have anxiety that the same thing might happen again every time I'm away from her. \n\n2.) when we hang out, and we're just relaxing and cuddling, sometimes it's just quiet and we don't talk about anything so I feel pressured to come up with an interesting conversation. I'm not sure if that's just the way she is (we've only been dating for a month) but sometimes it makes me think that she probably finds me boring which leads me back to my #1 concern. I had her take a personality test once and she tested as an ENFJ. \n\n3.) I am well aware that couples need space but I feel that I'm happiest when I'm around her even though sometimes we don't do much. I don't want to appear needy to her but that's what ends up happening whenever I get into a relationship. I want to spend every moment I can with them. \n\nI'm pretty sure I can keep going with the list but I'll keep it short. Basically it all ties into my #1 concern which is anxiety over her leaving because I'm not good enough for her. I felt this way because of how the previous one ended and I feel like it deeply damaged my self esteem. \n\nAre there any advice you guys can give me as far as overcoming/coping with these feelings. I know that if I don't do something about it now, it will end up dooming the relationship. I want to be better and I want to completely get rid of these walls that I have so that I can allow myself to fully invest my all into this new relationship. \n\nAlso some insight on how ENFJ's think when it comes to relationships will be greatly appreciated. 
2	You should probably just ask her, tell her about your fears, you really don't have to carry it alone. I'm in a relationship with an isfj so I understand how hard it really is to move on and how hard it is to trust someone. But the biggest way to build the trust especially an intuitive empath is to just be open.
2	GET OUT NOW
1	I'm an ENFJ with an ISFJ boyfriend! I'll edit my response in a bit.
1	Hello there, \nI read what you have written regarding your old relationship, I feel as if you are stuck playing that past experience over and over again trying to find out the WHY!\nAnd then you start blaming yourself thinking you did something wrong.\n\nTry to find a closure and learn from the past.\n\nI really feel that you are willing to open up to your girlfriend (ENFJ).\nHowever, try to let go of the past knowing that you did your best.
1	My ex is ISFJ and I am ENFJ. We really struggled with honest communication. We would discuss things on (what I now see in hindsight) was a superficial level as we didn't want to hurt each others feelings. And like someone else has said - I had to do a lot of guess work to know what he wanted etc. He put a lot of effort into keeping me happy and forgot himself. \nFrom my point of view I don't like being vulnerable as I see it as an easy way to get hurt. I am working on this. \nWe were together from late teens to late 20's so that might explain things too. We didn't know ourselves either.
4	[Academic] Perceptions of Self and Intimacy (20-35yo)	Hey there, hope you don't mind me attempting to pick your brains for a minute - I got good participation levels from other MBTI groups so I thought I'd extend it to all groups and try to get a more representative sample. FYI - the study is not collecting personality type information.\n\nMy dissertation for my masters in psychology is looking into one possible explanation for avoidance behaviours in forming intimate relationships. If you are 20-35yo and keen to contribute to my study then you can do so by following the link below. Any questions give me a shout, also I'm happy to discuss and hear your thoughts on the subject off the record if you want! It should't take too long but you're free to stop at any point anyway. It may cause some emotional distress as it involves some self evaluation so if you experience any discomfort and would like some guidance please get in touch.\n\nI will leave the survey open until the end of this week.\n\nCheers! \nhttps://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/F3BXHWN
4	New ENFJ friend skeptical about MBTI. thinks it puts people into boxes and is unproductive. I think part of why INTP's are drawn to MBTI is because Ti loves to categorize. Considering you guys have inferior Ti, how do you reconcile that? Are you initially drawn to MBTI from a different angle?	Personally I like MBTI for self-knowledge and interpersonal reasons. I actually think I might like it the best for developing Fe. \n\nP.S. ENFJ's are da bomb
8	I mostly just think mbti is fun and can be a handy tool for getting deeper inside people's heads. I feel like I understand myself and other people fairly well, but it's always fun to learn more about how people think.
3	All the enfjs that I've come across say that and actually prefer knowing why it's helpful first. Why would you spend so much time on something if you can't use it?
3	It makes sense to me that on a very basic level you can break down people's personalities - they are more likely to either need to bounce of people to work through things, or more likely to internalise things, for example. I don't think it's the be all and end all of personalities, but it makes sense.\n\nI personally use it more a self-reflection tool. 
3	I like it because it helps me understand my loved ones and helps me to improve my relationships. :)
3	I think MBTI is quite useful. People do fit into boxes for the most part. Rarely does a completely unique human come along. Michelangelo, Da Vinci, Bill Gates, George Washington, etc- there are a few "great" people but most people aren't super original
1	I am ENFJ and I also said that at first! Lol! Wow! 
1	I think that MBTI puts people into boxes indeed, but mostly boxes that fit them!!!\n\nWhen categorizing people, ENFJ depend on their Ni to know the other person and Ni is amazing at doing so!\n\nYou can imagine it as follows:\nENFJ Ni is the scanner to read other people, and having MBTI as a complement to Ni will result in outstanding outcomes.\n\n
1	I love finding out about what makes other people tick :). So probably our Fe traits.
1	Hey there,\n\nI'm 30 years of age and 10 years ago I took my first crack at the MBTI. Through the years I've retested probably 4 times. The first test I took resulted in ENFP, the second--the same, and the third INFP (I was really riding the E-I line anyway), and the last time (Today) my result is ENFJ. \n\nEvery time the test astounds me and reflects my personality concurrently to my maturation. I don't ever regard the results as reflecting me 100% and I don't ever feel boxed in. What I do feel is that the test result highly correlates with my personality as it currently is today. \n\nIt's funny, because my fiancé doesn't like the test for about the same reason as your friend. She is also quite content with no knowing in a very pragmatic sense. I on the other hand take the test regularly (10 years/4 test sessions at about every 3 years) and do so because I believe the test enhances my theory of self. I can audit my personality and decide if the way I am operating in the world matches my goals, and if I'm not, how can I work on the weaknesses of my personality type. Additionally, I like to be aware of the maladaptive aspects of my type.\n\nTo recap and apply toward your topic: I like to 'audit' my personality and find if the traits innate to my type are guiding me toward success. I believe this to be INHERENTLY box-defying as I can't be bound to a box since personality traits can be adjusted--fluidly changing with greater knowledge.\n\nThanks
1	I feel like MBTI is kickass. \nSo many things in this thing just aligns with what I've already seen in people, you know? That inferior Ti (that actually is a beast in many ENFJ's)- likes to conclude things, especially foundational templates, principles etc.\n\nNot to use it bluntly as if it just gives you some kind of x-ray vision, but it's really nice as, like I said, it aligns with many thoughts and ideas I've already had about people. :)
1	I think that INTXs are drawn to MBTI in large part because we want to understand WHY we are the way we are. When socializing comes naturally to you (as for ENFJs) there is perhaps less motivation to dive deeper and understand what makes people tick. \n\nA good thought exercise may be to think about how naturally skinny people are less likely to get into diets and may be skeptical of weight loss programs that overweight people get involved in. I've never tried these diets because I'm naturally slim, in spite of eating and drinking whatever I want. But just because the "body by Nintendo" program is all need, doesn't mean that more in depth nutrition and excercise programs aren't important for people without a natural gift. Likewise, I have taken a lot of interest in personality and interpersonal relations because that's NOT naturally easy for me. \n\nJust my two cents. 
5	Wait, I'm an enfj, but I don't know what people are talking about when they say fe. What is that?!	
3	Myers Briggs types are also a shorthand for ordered stacks of Jungian cognitive function (no link because I'm on my phone, sorry) preferences. The ENFJ prefers Extraverted Feeling (Fe), Introverted Intuition (Ni), Extraverted Sensation (Se), and Introverted Thinking (Ti), in that order, and has a less clear relationship with the other four (Fi, Ne, Si, and Te).\n\nExtraverted Feeling (Fe) in particular is a function that focuses on making evaluations of what is best, in the sense of most likely to create an agreeable feeling environment, for other people or groups of people that the ENFJ is involved with, and finding ways for the ENFJ to align with others' feelings and evaluations (picking up on these also involves Ni and Se). It wants harmony.
20	To enfj teens	I've seen some stuff in here about teen anxiety/ depression: \nI am 22 now. I completely went through all of that in high school as an enfj. I was an extrovert with social anxiety. I wanted to be my provacative self to everyone, but I was too afraid they would hate me because so many teenagers can be very judgmental (or at least that was my perception at the time), but just know that now that I have been out of high school for a few years, I am very comforable being weird at people for my own entertainment and to get a laugh out of them. I think that once you are an adult and everyone is more comfortable in their skin you will find that people really appreciate having fun bubbly people like you around! \nAlso when I had my first real boyfriend I was really clingy, but also not even as in love with him as he was with me. I have been very "needy" in a lot of relationships, and it took until recently to realize that it has nothing to do with how much I like the person I'm with. I'm just such an extrovert and I can't stand being alone, and if my friend or family isn't there then I will seek out my dating partner. It is very important to find balance. Spend lots of times with friends and family. Do some productive things on your own. Give your significant other time to be alone and with friends, especially if they are introverts!\nAlso there were times when I felt horrible and isolated and alone. THIS FEELING IS TEMPORARY! All feelings are temporary! Everything will always turn out okay! \nHope this was helpful!
5	As an ISTP I really shouldn't be reading this, it's giving me some dangerous ideas haha
4	Same here. And as a 27yo now - you can't keep everyone happy all the time. And try to see criticisms as a method of improvement and not a personal attack. This message is still more for myself than anyone else :D
3	As a 21 year old there is a lot of truth in this post! 
3	I absolutely love you, just what I needed to hear today <3 
5	MBTI Discord server	We have been working on this server for almost a year now, and at the moment we are staying at the 100+ members. We want to branch out, and that's why we're posting this. You're all welcome, even if you don't know your type. https://discord.gg/csDt8Jg
7	Aren't non-apologies (sorry-if-you apologies) offensive and insensitive?	I am currently coming out of the closet as queer, and while this could be my NxP cylinders firing, I just feel so disrespected and confused my medical professionals. So I'm convinced this is my Fe-use raising the sociocultural issue for discussion.\n\nIronically I do apologise in advance because this might not resonate with dominant Fe as much because it shows poor boundary formation. But I do believe it is sufficiently relevant to submit here. And without further ado, the rant... (**irate swearing included**):\n\nNon apologies piss me off so much. What the hell do they mean, "you're sorry if you/conditional-accusation"?! Do they meant that their actions were excusable, that there was no reason not to rewind time and fix it?\n\nThe reason you apologise is because you made a bad fucking decision and have to goddamn fix it. That means you tell the other person that you will not repeat the mistake and add to the shitness of the world. That you're a good person and you meant well, and just slipped from thought to hand/mouth.\n\nTo deliver a non apology is insulting at the highest order, because it disrespects the addressee's human dignity (Ne says: psst, can you tell, I like liberalist Kantian philosophy?). I cannot stand for such, nor accept it. So I fought back at those who disrespected my human, personal dignity.\n\nSo in typical ask-ENFJ format of this sub: am I justified in my aggression at non apologies? Am I blowing it out of proportion, according to your Ni thoughts? Am I just a whiny Ne that needs to shut up and go away without a leg to stand on and who's relatively inconvenienced compared to real troubles like world hunger? ENFjs: it's your time to decide my fate. :s :/

2	Looking for more ENFJs to join a typology discord!	I recently joined a Typology discord/community and there is a SEVERE lack of ENFJs and Fe Doms!  I was hoping some of you guys would be interested in joining and talking type or just hanging out.  \n\nHere is a link to the discord : https://discord.gg/FFQaFjh\n\n*there are over 1000 members from all over the world\n\nhope to see some of you guys there!\n\n
1	What is that? 
1	What I think constitutes good discussion here (Ti/Fe user)	Hi folks. I am a little unclear what the actual point of discussion in this forum is, so I thought I'd offer my thoughts on what I think is appropriate, and you folks can like challenge that or give me feedback or acknowledge it or throw it out, or whatever :3  (can you tell I'm ENTP and anxious? Sorry for the hypomania in advance...)\n\n* Discussion about Fe usage, especially in the dominant part of the stack; requests for directions to resources on Fe, specific questions about behaviours associated with using the function, comparison to Fi, etc.\n\n* Relationship issues with Fe problems in play (eg setting boundaries, avoiding harm, being honest, sincere etc to avoid ethical hurt)\n\n* Sympathy or heartbreak posts; looking for advice on things more general than relationships. General complicated life problems where aux Ni comes into play.\n\n* ~~Discussion of key sociopolitical issues~~ (where not overly contentious -- general political policy more of an ENTJ thing but I think we definitely have room for scholarly debate here? Eg on like, whether we should feed kids school lunches? Or how welfare should work? Maybe that's my Ti speaking more than my Fe?) (**edit:** yes, definitely this is my Ti argumentative side trying to balance out my Fe-ness haha)\n\nThanks in advance for your comments, I am keen to see what you folks feel and think is appropriate here and I think this is important to discuss as Fe-users.\n\n-tech/Kristina
5	I just love reading responses from other ENFJs and knowing there are other people out there who are similar to me!\n\nI tend to passively absorb knowledge/ideas/advice so I'm less of a thread creator/discussion starter than a contributor. Maybe others are similar?\n\nI'm definitely down for all kinds of discussions and scholarly "debates" though.
5	I like what we have here :-) Of course, I wish we saw more posts, but that can't be helped.\n\nFirst, since we are extraverted, I suspect many of us don't spend too much of our time/ life online, which explains the lack of activity on here. To be honest, I don't like online conversations. Not even on messaging apps. I much, much, prefer in-person conversation. To me, the experience of in-person conversation can and will never be replaced by text online, no matter how eloquent.\n\nSecond, I think we'll always see more posts from non-ENFJs than ENFJs. If my experiences and preferences are in any way representative of that of the other ENFJs here, I would hardly ever seek out help and comfort online when I'm down... \n\nIt's in our nature to want to fix things on our own/ privately/ with our loved ones in real life. We also don't discuss what happened unless we're asked; and when we are, we only discuss when we know it's done and dusted.\n\nThird. Of course, socio-political discussions will be so welcome. I suspect we'll get a different phrasing of the same idea though, which is what happens a lot around here.
1	PS: paging /u/lawdoodette because I'm a desperate attention seeking dorky freak and maybe I subconsciously thought including the word "constitutes" in the title would draw her as a lawyer here :3
1	Huh, that's an interesting question and I don't think I've really thought much about the answer. I definitely think a lot of people come here seeking to understand how Fe works, but I think anything that has to do with experiencing something through an ENFJ lens or trying to find common ground with other ENFJs are fair game. I would love to have more sociopolitical discussions as I was a debate nerd in high school and am very passionate about social issues, though a lot of ENFJs would probably shy away from making a political post because we hate conflict. I feel like we'd be more likely to respond to one than to start one, though all of this is speculation. I'm sure someone else can give you a more eloquent answer.

3	Can a Fe-dom explain to me what Fe is?	Hello ENFJs. You are Fe-dom and I want to know how you form your values/ morals and what changes them. I'd like to know what your experiences are.
8	it's all about what is better for the majority and the masses.   we tend to think in terms of how things effect the group and how the group feels, rather than just ourselves.  our morals tend to fall in line with things of that nature, such as acceptance, etc.  hope this helps. :)
3	No. But only because I am a Fe tert. But I use it heavily enough to occasionally pass for an extroverted feeler because I'm heavily neurotic!\n\nSo I'll try to describe the Fe function  *logically* with my stock answer and if you're INTJ as I suspect, you can fill in the details.\n\nExtroverted Feeling concerns itself with **ethical harmony and sympathetic action**. Users of Fe seek to *prevent hurt and intervene against pain* and harm, desiring an **environmental state** that is *stable, healthy, honest, and open minded*. **Awareness of feeling/emotions** feeds into this manipulation of social state, and of course as extroverted, Fe use is inherently prosocial, and often altruistic.\n\nIn application this often manifests as **good social expectation management**. *Boundary* setting and enforcement is commonly a strength. Expect to be excluded if you're not helpful, or trollish (but the mods here do a great job!). Knowing how people react socially and being courteous is a big part of achieving this; being authentically honest, if not necessarily sincere and fully truthful is vital to being tactful and keeping the peace they have established (through application of filtered--through Ti principles and via Ni systems modelling/analysis). \n\nKey **contrasts with Fi** are in the Fi-sincerity v authenticity (e); as well as exactly understanding empathy (Fi) vs actions of approximate sympathy (Fe).\n \n. \n\nSo yup that's Fe in a nutshell. I can't speak to tertiary looping, look up mbti-notes.tumblr.com for that info. Hope this helps. Please don't down vote without providing constructive and clear criticism.
3	I'd say my values are flexible and my morals are more concrete. My moral compass can be simply summed up as do as much good and as little harm as possible. My values tend to revolve around making people feel safe, happy, and comfortable so my actions often change to reflect that. I'll act differently around one group of people than another because different people have different emotional needs. Like with some friends I'll be very blunt and straightforward because I know they value honesty, whereas with others I might be more gentle with how I word things because I know they value kindness. 
2	How a given situation affects people. If it causes suffering, it's wrong. And not in a "your behavior hurts us" kind of way. I have little regard for families who abandon drug addicts and people with mood disorders as if their actions are some moral failing instead of an indication of something really fucking wrong. If you think black people are inherently violent and won't research why it is we're lead to believe that, I have little to no respect for you. \n\nThat said, I know how I feel. I know what's right. But being forced to externalize those feelings by trying to explain them to others helps really solidify them in my mind.
1	INTJs seem most likely to try to understand us, because we're so different. It's impossible to type you off of your original post though. 
5	Need help understanding ENFJ (or just human) behavior	Ello, lately I've been experiencing a kind of behavior I don't really understand and thought ENFJs might have some good insight. I think the person of topic (my teacher) might be an ENFJ. \n\nHe's a bit moody so sometimes he's very polite almost to the point of showiness, but other times he could be very impertinent humor wise. He's a people person, & flits from student/group to student/group to chat, and I notice he does chameleon. Most of the time, he's a thoughtful conversationalist and acts silly with some. He's always struck me as being open and tolerating, and is very popular with both the students and the staff.\n\nHowever, I feel as though he's abrupt with me and prone to putting me on the spot even though I'm easily the quietest student. Sometimes he even sounds angry with me, which can be very unnerving for me and I literally freeze when I hear the tone, but the tone also dissipates soon after I respond in some way.\n\nWhat kind of hurts is that he called me out in front of the whole class for coming back late from a lunch break when there were others who would come to class up to an hour or more late (without being called out) and he's not always punctual himself. It's a laid back studio class where we just sit and draw and he goes around offering help. I deal with a lot of anxiety, so when I couldn't take it anymore, I walked out to take a break once while people were drawing. I exited quietly, thinking he didn't notice but he came out too, asked if I was okay, but he was vexed and his tone was so abrasive rather than soft, which I'd expect if he was concerned. So I took it as him trying to disguise irritation with concern, which made me nervous. I just walked off right back to class after saying that I'm just tired. In similar class environments, I've never had a problem with taking breaks, so I felt more compelled to think he has a problem with me.\n\nOn the last day of class, we went out on a field trip to draw off site. It was the most painful last day I've ever had. I don't have any friends in the class and with my social anxiety, it was too uncomfortable for me to sit with everyone. I just chose my own place in the park to draw, but after two hours of drawing, I looked up and saw the teacher on the way down the street. I looked around and realized everyone had left and he and the TA were the last. I was sitting near the park exit, so he'd walked past me without letting me know. I just felt so abandoned and alone to see that the whole class was gone. It just seemed like the kind thing to do to at least say bye, doesn't it? Am I being too sensitive? I just felt so sad to look around and see that everyone was gone. It felt unreal...\n\nI can't stop thinking about what I did wrong besides being antisocial. I'm thinking my antisocial tendencies must have come off as disrespect, but does that really warrant the kind of treatment I felt from this teacher? What do you ENFJs think? Do you relate to or understand from the POV of this teacher? Help me understand, please. Thanks!
4	I'm an eNFj and a former design student, so hopefully my thoughts on this are helpful. I think your professor may be in his own head and has jumped to conclusions about you. I used to think that people with social anxiety were just introverts who didn't enjoy being around other people. (Sounds like your professor has some anxiety issues, actually.) If your teacher assumed you're a loner who doesn't like talking to people, that could explain why he doesn't know how to treat you. \nIf you find yourself in a similar situation again, you could explain to the other person that you sometimes get anxious, but it doesn't mean you want to be ignored, are trying to be rude, etc. That would be better than letting people guess what's up, especially if they have an extrovert's view of the world.
6	I think there has been a misunderstanding on the teacher's part early in the semester.  Perhaps he misread your anxiety and introvertedness as disinterest in the course, or maybe he's scared you'll behave erratically if not "kept in line" (not that that's true, but human nature tends to assume ridiculous things).  Two options are to accept that it won't really get much better before the end of the class and just ignore him the best you can, or try to show that you want a better working relationship by smiling, trying to come out of your shell a little with the other students, and saying things like "Thanks for showing us that one thing.  You're a great teacher."  Is it a little disingenuous? Maybe.  But as a ENFJ thing, he might lighten up a bit if he feels he's making a difference for you.
2	Abrupt? Interesting. His behaviour with others certainly strikes me as ENFJ too, to corroborate. What is your type? I need more context to run a proper analysis; but I assume INTP or logically/rationally similar?
7	enfj seducing style?	hey im just trying to see the different types,as enfjs what is your style of seducing women and women vise versa?
27	Straight forewardness & corny jokes. 
8	I absolutely suck at seducing women, so I just try to get to know them better and hope they like being around me/enjoy my personality! 
6	Gimme a cheesy pickup line and I'll say it REALLY LOUD 
3	I am such a terrible tease in Fe mode. It's honest, it's straight forward and upfront, it's never insincere. It's a nice and friendly style, but I'll get smutty if  have to impress! \n\nAs a Ne user I do couple this with relevant observations but as that's my subconscious shadow, you will have to wait for a true Ni user to confirm what subjects they cover while they flirt.
3	They ask me out\n\nSource, am istp
2	I focus a lot of attention on her and try to find out more about her. This usually starts with lots of humor and a funny story about myself. People feel more comfortable when you reveal a little something about yourself first. \n\nAlso, depending on our dynamic it might result with lots of teasing where I make fun of her or shower her with lots of cheesy pick up lines. The pick up lines aren't forced and are given at opportune times when she least expects it or when she's said something that opens the opportunity (sometimes I'm surprised with what I come up with).\n\nIt's mainly attention giving and making her feel special. So lots of talks, texts, and taking care of her.\n\n
1	[Not ENFJ specific but this might help out!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OdeEzon_0)
17	Bad Moods and How to Help Them	I may be atypical for an ENFJ, and I would love to find out how to subtype, but I wonder if this is how you all are too.  When I'm in a bad mood, I hate when someone (SO, parent, friend) "tries to cheer me up" by poking fun at me or making jokes at my expense.  If I'm in a bad mood, I want to be coddled a bit:  make me cocoa, put on my favorite movie, do some chore for me that I really dread doing (even if it makes me cringe a little that you're folding the shirts wrong), and just let me be mad.  I'll get over it soon enough.  But when I'm being teased, it just makes me more upset.  It's like, I'm already beating myself up internally for being grumpy and lazy ANYWAY, I don't need you to point it out.  \n\nLet me know if this is how you are too, if this leans toward another MBTI type, and other reflections.  Thanks!
6	Hello, I think it's a personal preference thing and not really a type thing. Your preference is not wrong either!\n\nPersonally, I'm okay with both sickly sweet coddling. and being teased and made fun of. The former lets me cry and vent like a little baby, the latter makes me laugh because I realise how dumb I'm acting.\n\nSometimes I even ask them to deliver me the harshest truth: why? Because I KNOW what the harsh truth is, it's even better if I hear it out loud. 
4	I've learned to laugh at it and accept it. My boyfriend's gotten to the point now where he'll lightly tease me after I vent about being overwhelmed or being stressed and I'll just stop and whine, "I'm sensitiiiiiiive you're supposed to give me goddamn compliments and tell me I'm the best thing that ever happened to you." And he'll roll his eyes and reply with a snarky comment but he'll be smirking and making fun of the situation with me.\n\nIf you're feeling bad, try embracing it and recognizing that it's temporary. It's still annoying getting teased like that, but flipping the situation on it's head helps if you can turn it from making fun of you to making fun of the negative feelings.
3	I tend to get really emotional,  but learning CBT has really helped me see through the emotions to the underlying events.\n\nThat's said,   I still need a book,  some rainy weather,  and tea.  Solitude is my go to remedy.
2	I'm not a fan of teasing during serious moments either. Can't quite pin it on a specific function between Ti and Fe though :/\n\nOne of my friends (I think she's ESFP or something Fi-aux-y?) mentioned I bought the wrong bedsheets yesterday. I say mentioned, she really went on for a bit about it. At the end I snapped back a little and just told her to shut up, tongue in cheek. I couldn't come up with a serious response but I was pretty frustrated with her teasing me over my purchase of those sheets. (I'll be trying to use them tomorrow and we'll see who gets the last laugh...)  >:)  so in short, yeah! It's not just you!
2	I get soooo angry if I get teased while grumpy!! I need a cup of tea and a cuddle.
7	enfj humor?	what kind of humor are enfjs into?its hard to tell since there fe is always laughing at any joke someone makes even if they dont find it funny?
23	I like super sarcastic responses and insults.  I have a very "dry" sense and I only joke with or insult people I like.
12	I dunno I like dry humor sometimes, but only when it's rooted in a kindhearted place. I don't like genuine insults aimed at hurting someone. My favorite comedies have a heart at the center of the humor like Parks and Rec, Community, Bob's Burgers, Brooklyn 99, and shows like that. 
4	I often get told that i come off rude or insulting to my friends. Honestly nothing mean that I ever say is meant to come out that way, I am merely joking with them. This is only how I joke with friends, though. I typically do not really joke or share my humor with acquaintances. 
4	It's the type of humor where you can joke and point out things about life in a really intelligent and articulate way that'll draw me to you. I'll laugh at any joke, (thanks FE), but when I find that person who I can just build off of in both a socially-intelligent and humorous way, I'm SO happy. I think there's a difference between being mean and sarcastic though that a lot of people don't get. I don't like to stand at the back of the line at Starbucks and rip apart that basic white girl getting her coffee, but I will make fun of basic white girls in general with you, and always follow it up with a self-deprecating reference to how as much as I hate it, I too need my Pumpkin Spice Lattee's. I'M ONE OF THEMMMM.\n\n There's a weird nuanced difference in my mind where social things are awesome to make fun of and point out, but not specific people. 
3	For specific comedians: Louie C.K. and Dave Chapelle always have me rolling. I am never offended by any of their jokes because I understand it is just comedy. There is something about there sarcastic, dry humor based on real life that just gets me. 
2	dry humor is hilarious
2	I'll laugh at anything. And my personal humour is dry wit or lame goofiness.
3	Just wrote a post on How to balance and control Fe problems for ENFJs based on my own practices	
2	I want to say my problem is finding someone to talk to lol. I can get calm in situations, keep my anger deflected. But those days where you litterally just feel like garbage and want a hug, those are the hard ones. \n\nWe spend so much time on others it's hard be introspective and know when we've had enough. At least for me, it's usually the days I have to myself. My thoughts get away and it's hard to keep it together. Yeah when people show up I'm back to 'myself', maybe with more of a bite, but it's not how I feel. 
1	Maybe you already know the methods in the post, I know ENFJs are all smartass. But anyway.
1	Am istp, agreed
1	Getting a database error, sorry :s
9	tactics you use when delving into unhealthy mindsets?	As ENFJ's, our least developed function naturally is Inverted Thinking. So for me personally, when I get trapped in my own head, it's like a nuclear bomb of chaos and negativity. And I've progressed to the point where logically, I know I have no reason to be sad/upset/anxious. It was just a rough day, I'm relatively isolated for this particular day, sure I don't have anyone to talk to or relate too but my life is perfect and tomorrow will be a lot better! ... I say all that to myself logically, but inside it still feels like a chaotic vortex of emotions. \n\nI think we can all relate to tapping into our unhealthy states, and for ENFJ's I feel like we can be particularly volatile among the Myers-Briggs types. When we're at our best and most happy, we can change the atmosphere of a room just by walking into it. Our power to induce positive changes around us is incredible, but I feel like a downside to that is that when we're in an unhealthy mindset, we can be really destructive... first towards ourselves, and if left unchecked, to the atmosphere around us. \n\nWhat tactics do you guys find help? For me, I've learned that long walks in sunlight do wonders for my mood. Even if it's raining out or night, I'll go drive somewhere. It's hard to force myself to get moving, but getting into a different environment can usually snap me out of a toxic mindset. Also, I've taken to making video diary entries. I never watch them afterwards and only do them when I'm feeling particularly sad, but being able to articulate what I'm feeling and why is SO helpful, even if it's just to a video camera. Most of it I feel like is silence due to me processing how I'm feeling, but that's just it, it forces me to process and articulate my feelings, which helps snap me out of that dreaded Introverted Thinking function haha. 
5	>Also, I've taken to making video diary entries.\n\nI snapchat literally (ok not literally) every thought/feeling I have. Decided it's my personal outlet to be honest and obnoxious and not care what other people think. It's helped me a lot. And the snaps autosave so yay memories if I ever do want to go back to them.
5	Sad playlist. Super, super sad. 
1	Sad playlist. Super, super sad. 
1	I definitely vent to close and  trusted friends - need to get them suffocating feels out. And good friends - better Te/Ti's can be helpful to clarify your thoughts.\nSport - soccer, get some adrenaline going.\nThere is an interesting link about ENFJ's and conflict that I can find for you if you want it. Not sure if your bad days include conflict like mine do!\nCup of tea and some deep breaths, music that sort o thing :)
3	What book with a happy ending should i give to an eNFJ?	Ideally a classic. \n\nmore specific: female, age 15
3	Hmm. I really loved Pride and Prejudice at that age, but I needed the BBC miniseries interpretation to help me through the dry parts ;)\n\nI also loved the Bell Jar, and it's not too much of a stretch to say that it ends happily. 
2	A Prayer for Owen Meany. \n\nKind of sad/but happy and fulfilling ending. I read it my senior year of HS.
2	A Series of Unfortunate Events. (Better ending than it looks.)\n\nHarry Potter. (Studies show reading it actually makes you a better person.)\n\nThe Mortal Instruments.\n\nVampire Academy books.\n\nPride and Prejudice and Zombies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
1	*Justine or The Misfortunes of Virtue* by Marquis De Sade\n\nO:)
1	I'm an eNFj, and when I was her age, I adored "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "The World According to Garp."
6	what can i give you?	There is an ENFJ at school that has been really nice to shy me.. what kind of compliments and/or gifts should I give her?
5	Yourself and your time! :) Chances are she's sweet because she enjoys your company; there's no need to thank her with objects.
4	What Each Myers Briggs Type is Like As a Parent	
2	##ENFJ- The Generous Parent\n\nAs parents ENFJs are eager to be as supportive and loving as possible. They are pleased with the opportunity to care for their children’s needs and desires. They may have a hard time with discipline, and might use guilt manipulation to control their children. They put forth a lot of effort to making sure that their children are well cared for and as happy as possible. They are openly affectionate and warm, and want to be the best parents they can be.\n\n---\n\nSeems kinda right, but I always imagine myself also pretty strict. I never know, though. 
26	Does anyone else feel exhausted being empathic all the time?	New here! Hi!\n\nDon't get me wrong, nothing makes me happier than helping others--I volunteer on my free days, foster animals, and love to listen to my friends and coworkers. But, it can be really exhausting sometimes, at least for me. Then I find I start to resent that I'm this way. \n\nI genuinely feel like that character in the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie who can read and help the emotions of others. \n\nAnyone else feel this way? How do you avoid emotional burn out?
10	I tend to avoid emotional burnout by keeping my distance every once in a while. Don't get me wrong, I love people! But sometimes it feels good to relax and have a little time for me. I'll hang out with some of my more introverted friends or just take a walk somewhere with lots of plants. It helps, at least for me. Then I can go back and connect with people with renewed energy.
8	It's a common problem for all ENFJ's! It got really bad for me recently, my friends had the best of intentions but I don't think they realized how draining it was for me to constantly be the person that they vent to or to give them advice. If it was just them, it'd be fine! I love letting my friend vent to me every once in a while. But it's hard to articulate, "Yes, I know this relationship problem is confusing and hard for you... but I have literally four unread messages from other people about THEIR relationship problems too". I think because we as ENFJ's are just so fascinated by other people, our interest comes across as insanely genuine, which is why we can draw in other's so easily on a social sphere. But when everyone is trying to crowd around us, it stops being interesting and starts being suffocating. \n\nI've learned how to keep a safe distance when I feel myself getting overwhelmed. It's now common for me to wait a day or two before responding to a message from a friend, so I can space out conversations so I'm only letting one or two people vent to me a day. If I try to have multiple conversations going on at once throughout the day, I get insanely stressed and burnt out. It's not burnt out physically, it's technically super easy to respond to messages, you just take a few seconds out of your day to type up quick responses! But it's the emotional/mental investment that gets you, and that's why it's super important to keep track of how much we're investing in other people every day and to pull back when we feel like we've reached our limit and need to recharge ourselves. 
5	I also find that mentality really helps. You're not helping to be their problem solver. Not everything is in our locus of control. I feel like the mere fact that you're there and listening to them is enough. In fact, it's greater than any advice you can give. But you must come into terms with that. We can't always save everyone even if we wanted to. \n\nAt the same time, if people can't reciprocate even an inkling of support for you, then maybe they're also not worth it. We cannot keep on giving in a relationship. Both parties have to grow so therefore, both have to give and receive. \n\nHope that helps :) 
2	We all do when theres no reciprocation. It might be insecurities. 
2	I get that, but I get it out of my system by being viscious in my debate class xD
2	Sounds like you need a good INFP to help you recover.

2	Cutting negative people out of your life really helps. 
1	Yes, am istp
10	Who else gets emotional after watching a heroic act in a movie or real life?	Hi, I was just watching [this video](https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/6bnds1/iraqi_bulldozer_driver_blocks_a_isis_suicide_car/?st=J2T5OW86&sh=92794915) and I remembered that everytime I watch heroic acts I get really emotional. \n\nAnimes, movies, etc of self sacrifice for a altruistic reason always gets to my heart.\n\nIs it just me? Im a 3w4 sx ENFj btw, just in case this is an enneagram thing.\n\nPS: the guy in the video is a brave hero.\n\n
2	yeaaa i can't help but hold back tears when stuff like that happens. i'm just like so touched by acts of selflessness 
1	All. The. Time. 
1	its easy to spot infjs and enfjs....	after watchng alot of youtube int6erviews i noticed i can easily spot enfjs and infjs but more easily enfjs because of fe yoou can instantly see a person who uses fe and ni liek this,first you can see your body language and expressions seem to be very formulated during a convo or interview like you can see them putting on a certain posture,emotion expression,secondly you can see introverted intuition by the concentration like when they thinking you can always see this single pointed focus and intensilty i cant explain it but just check it out,what do you guys think?
4	Haha, people can read my face like a book, I'm so freaking expressive. It's not pure emotional reactions though, that's where the NI comes in, my mind is ALWAYS turning and racing and analyzing and making sense of the social things I'm noticing and changing my own body posture / facial reactions to respond to them. 
1	Quick question, What traits do INFJs usually show , I have a general idea but I want to hear from the insights you gather about what traits do INFJs usually show.\n\nENFJs are starting to become easier to spot though. maybe because my big sis is a ESFJ, I can spot Fe-doms almost naturally now, that I understand MBTI more. 
8	how to get closer to ENFJ?	I want to get beyond small talk; I want to be a closer friend\n\n- INTJ that was coaxed out of a cave by kind ENFJ 
6	be a robot they think they can make use of
5	Intj here who has been with an enfj forever. So not sure if this will help in the beyond small talk end, but it might help the not being so intj-ish\n\n1. You know that emotional fortress of solitude you have, and the public face you have developed to deal with the world (I know i hate it to). Ya... Drop it. They may not see through you completely, but they know your faking it and will hate you for it.\n\n2. You know how your not sentimental and dont care about things... Just people. Ya they will care about both, my wife values people first but objects can have huge meaning to her in way i just cant get. Accept it and move on.\n\n3. Lastly when they get upset and they will. (cause they are are human as are you). Dont try to solve the issue cause they are more then able to, generally they are just venting (fyi in my observation this a good sign that they trust you). Just listen and if they need a hug just hold them. And for the love of god dont look at the internet cause you got bored !\n\nI guess what im saying is get comfortable being uncomfortable. They will make you a better person because of it.\n\nTotally worth every minute fyi
3	Invest in them and their self-worth the way that they might do for you. I know that I genuinely, genuinely care about my friend's lives and their hopes and their dreams and their ambitions.... and when that gets reciprocated I get so happy.\n\nAlso, compliments are like food for ENFJ's. Literally just take a second, stop them, and say "I just wanted to let you know that you've been a fantastic friend and I admire (insert thing you admire) about you so much" and they'll want to be your best friend for life. 
2	I'm an ENFJ, and my very best friend is an INTJ. 
9	Mending the ENFJ heart...?	Hello kind ENFJs,\n\nI'm a humble INTJ that needs your help. \n\nMy ENFJ co-worker (and close friend) has been suffering from a catastrophic heartbreak for the past couple of months. While I know it's natural to feel pain and let your emotions process them, I fear that she's getting worse as time goes by. It's even starting to affect her work and work relationships. I can't say I blame her, though... life's given her so much shit that I'd rather not disclose out of respect for her. Just know that she doesn't deserve ANY of the pain she has to deal with as she's unquestionably one of the most wholesome, loving souls I've ever encountered. It literally crushes me to have to see her going through life's motions half-alive, under such emotional duress. As such, I must ask you guys...\n\nHow do you deal with heartbreak or extreme emotional pain? Is there ANYTHING at all that I can do to help?\n\nThank you so much for your time. Any help or input is appreciated.\n\n\n
9	Agh this is so heartbreaking to hear about. \n\nWe can suppress grief (unhealthily) as we don't want to let it get us down or affect our loved ones. She might not talk about it until things get too difficult to bear; so you might have to wait for her. She might be willing to talk about it in a one on one setting, where you can just focus on the issue, and give it the proper amount of time to grieve properly.\n\nA lot of this stuff above all depends on who she is and how she processes grief. That's your call.\n\nShe will eventually come to someone close to help her deal with it, and if you make yourself available in person, she can come to you.\n\nHonestly, the best thing for me personally is quality time and a long, sincere hug from someone I deeply care about when something rough happens. Just straight up emotional support. Sit, care, talk. Be there for her.
3	lots nad lots of distractions.\n\nHang outs and activities to help forget about the pain.  It helped me out a lot when my friends would hit me up to hang out and do things while i was in pit of sadness
3	Personally as an ENFJ guy, i'm just an emotional and passionate person.\nWhen I experienced heart break and split up with my ex, I was devastated, and nothing really helped except for the passage of time.\n\nI guess for me, it was more internal and I just had to give it time, until I could be my normal self little by little.\n\nBtw I'm ENFJ-A (protagonist)
1	Hey, I was this ENFJ for the past 3 years.\n\nJust hang out with her and talk to her and don't let her feel alone. She's going to need time to get over it and process feelings and that's okay. She doesn't want to force a happy face and shouldn't have to. She'll feel guilty not being able to put on a happy face if she thinks that's what you're after. \n\nBe okay with her not being okay. Don't run from her or hide from her or make a huge deal out of it.
1	It's hard to analyze the situation since you did not disclose the problems.\n\nSolutions are always the best for anything, providing a solution is way more efficient than just comforting. \n\nIf she trusts you, be alongside her as a friend and share some burdens of hers.       \n\nIt's best to not let her stay in this state for long, otherwise she would break down. Comes from some experienced one. 
8	It's always a good idea to help	If you know someone who's hurting in your life, whether it's a roommate or a random acquaintance.  Make time to help them out, even if it’s just for ten minutes or an hour of your day.  A kind gesture helps a ton!  I can’t even count how many people send me messages years later thanking me for what I said long ago. Like, even if these people aren’t going to be your best friends or hold any impact in your life, you might be able to make a difference.

2	Any other ENFJs got over their first love relatively easily?	I just got married to my second partner of two years (let's call her Michelle) a week ago and started marveling over the crazy timeline of my romantic life. My first relationship (let's call her Paula) lasted about 18 months - half of that was long distance since I was overseas for my Masters. During my Masters I met Michelle and fell for her. At first the attraction was strong but superficial and I had no intention of breaking up with Paula, but as I got to know Michelle more I couldn't help but question my choice. \n\nWhen I first got together with Paula, it was as if 25 years' worth of love that had been bottled inside me suddenly had an outlet. I was so over the moon to be dating her in the first few weeks and months, but I quickly discovered that she and I were never sexually compatible. We had sex maybe 10 times in total but she always seemed rather tepid/hesitant about it and over time that dampened my initial attraction to her. My sexual needs weren't being fulfilled. And while she was by no means stupid and quite smart in her own right, I found that she was lacking in a certain intellectual curiosity and that she wasn't really willing to show me the 'deeper' her - or maybe she just didn't have that side to her. But she was really physically attractive (probably more so than Michelle) and a kind person, and we had many mutual friends. She was definitely my best friend, but it increasingly felt like we were best friends / roommates. \n\nBefore I started my Masters overseas I was already wondering if I should stay with her or break up, and meeting and getting to know Michelle only made my relationship with Paula suffer more. I'm not proud of it, but during the last months of my relationship there was some cheating (at least emotionally) with Michelle, and when Michelle realised what was happening she told me we should stop seeing each other until I could figure myself out. I flew home during Easter and had a difficult talk with Paula, but we mutually agreed to break up. I felt extremely sad for the first three weeks, but I wonder if it was more out of sentimentality and guilt than heartbreak. When I returned to my studies, I told Michelle that I was ready to slowly start exploring my relationship. She told me she would date me alongside other guys, and we kept it open for about a month. When she started seeing this other guy who was really keen on going steady with her, I knew I had to tell her I wanted exclusivity. We got together and have been inseparable for the two years since.\n\nMichelle is the love of my life - we have such a strong relationship even though we are opposites in many ways. She challenges me and amazes me (and infuriates me). I sometimes catch myself thinking, 'I am the happiest man in the world,' and who I have become is largely intertwined with who she is. I see my whole future with her laid out before me, bright as day.  \n\nI'm wondering if I'm atypical in that it didn't take a lot of heartbreak for me to move on from my first relationship? I remember Paula and the times we shared with fondness but I can't imagine what I would have missed out on if I had stayed with her. I guess the point is that a lot of people often romanticise their first love even when it's just pretty...meh. \n\n---\n\n**TL;DR;** : Broke up with first partner after meeting current partner and never looked back. Not much heartbreak involved. Anyone else relate? Would love to hear similar stories. 
1	I can relate.  I was dating this one guy for a few months before I found my current bf.   We hung out and eventually started to get intimate before I had this one random encounter with my bf.  I fell for my bf super hard that night and met with the guy I was seeing at the time to break up with him.  I make it a thing where if I’m finding myself not happy with my current partner (as in feeling miserable and what nots) vs someone who makes me happy and fulfills me emotionally, I’ll go for the obvious choice.  Never regret going after someone that you find more compatible with you, just make sure to end things properly.
1	Just got out of a deep, emotional relationship with who I consider to be my first love. We were together a little over a year but best friends for two years. It was really, really hard for three days... Then I got a new distraction and haven't cried about it since. It doesn't make sense to me because I truly, deeply loved the guy and now I'm easily getting over it. Not sure why
1	I get over every love relatively easily. I tell myself that if we weren't bringing out each others best, and we weren't meeting each others needs, then we aren't meant to be together, and there isn't just one person for anyone. 
6	what should i include in my letter	i dont think this enfj is romantically interested in me so none of that..\ni still want to thank her for her small acts of kindness
5	Just be frank about it. ENFJ myself and I really enjoy it when people are clear that they are thankful or appreciative for something.\n\nThis type of thanks is something we **crave** as a form of gratification, so the fact you're sending anything will make her feel great :)
6	Honestly, just be genuine! Don't worry, I'll go into that more in a second. But, whenever writing letters to close friends, I usually use this template (obviously with changes to make it more personal, but I find this isn't a bad place to start):\n\nHi/Hey, [name],\n-\nI was [doing something; just a filler] and I had the sudden urge to write you a letter. More of a thank-you letter, really. I want to let you know that I really appreciate [**general** quality, action, or something they regularly do]. When you do/say/[other verb] things like [**specific** instances], you help to make my day and I'm not sure if I've told you that before.\n-\n[Here you can usually say more or go a bit more in-depth; i.e. "I really enjoy being around you and you mean a lot to me." etc. etc.]\n-\nLove/Yours/Your friend/[sometimes you can skip this part]\n-\n-[Your name]\n-\nReally, though, don't feel the need to "process" how you feel or make your thanks seem more "appropriate" by turning it down some. Now, don't write three paragraphs about how much you love when they look at you, but say how appreciative you are of the small things they do. Checking in on you, making you your favorite latte, etc. People generally like being told that they do something that someone else likes.
2	Foreseeing bad developments in people	I've had social anxiety for 2 years now and I've been avoiding people that might possibly see me as being gay. It's like I don't want them to think I'm gay but I'm kind of subconsciously provoking them by doing little things that might be suspicious.\n\nI can't seem to think this matter though well.
5	you are not ENFJ in the slightest\n\nmore likely depressed NP
1	[deleted]
9	How do I know if I'm an extrovert if I'm isolated?	I've been isolated alot and have gone through plenty of mental health problems like anxiety and mild bi-polar. I'm also male 16.
3	Being an extrovert is all about where you get your energy. As an extrovert with depression, you'd know if you were isolating and you were one. After I've been isolating I get this horrible feeling in my body that's similar to when I haven't done anything all day or wake up from a nap and it's dark. I just feel lethargic and unmotivated and alone and in my own head. And when someone does drag me out of the house, I start feeling energized. The sadness turns to anger and action and motivation. 
3	Jungian Functions which MBTI is based out of says there are 8 Jungian Functions.\n\n4 related to Perception\n\n4 related to Judging\n\nThe 4 Perception functions are\n\n* Se, Sensing **Extroverted** / thoughts related to sensing directed externally, into the external world\n\n* Si, Sensing **Introverted** / thoughts related to sensing directed internally, into your internal world, your mind's eye\n\n* Ne, I**n**tuition **Extroverted** / thoughts related to pattern recognition aka intuition directed externally, into the external world\n\n* Ni, I**n**tuition, **Introverted** / thoughts related to pattern recognition aka intuition directed  directed internally, into the internal world\n\nAnd 4 Judging Functions\n\n* Fe, Feeling **Extroverted** / thoughts related to feeling directed externally, into the external world\n\n* Fi, Feeling **Introverted** / thoughts related to feeling directed internally, into your internal world, your mind's eye\n\n* Te, Thinking **Extroverted** / thoughts related to thinking directed externally, into the external world\n\n* Ti, Thinking, **Introverted** / thoughts related to thinking directed internally, into the internal world\n\nAll human beings use all 8 jungian functions.\n\nBut we have preferences, we have preferences for 4 of the functions.  Think of each Thinking, Feeling, Intutition, and Sensing as a line, a spectrum of 4 different styles of colors and we have a preference towards the left or right of each color.\n\nFor example\n\nWe may prefer Dark Blue over Light Blue, Dark Red over Pink, Dark Forest Green over Light Grass Green, Dark Grey almost Black over Light Grey almost White.  We may have a preference for 4 of these colors, but in reality think of them as 4 lines with opposite ends of the spectrum and we use all 8 ends of the spectrum to perceive reality just like vision uses all 8 ends of the spectrum to see the world in color but we may have favorite colors of personal preference.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd while we may prefer 4 aspects out of 8, we even have a preference for a certain style of perception and a certain style of judgiing, aka 2 of the jungian functions out of 8.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere is the MBTI chart of all the 16 types, and the 4 primary functions of each type.\n\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v421/skaterkicker/cgn-fct-family.gif\n\nNotice an ENFJ is listed as Fe=>Ni=>Se=>Ti and an INFJ is listed as an Ni=>Fe=>Ti=>Se\n\nAka the first two functions are the same with an ENFJ and an INFJ.  Both are Ni and Fe but which is first or second determine whether you are an ENFJ or an INFJ.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPut another way we are all introverts and we are all extroverts, but we may show more of one side of our being due to the environment and due to the mood.  An ENFJ may act more like an INFJ in certain environments, and in certain moods, and also whether the environment is stressful or not and what was the stress level prior to the environment.\n\nSome ENFJs are ambiverts and are on the border between acting like an ENFJ and INFJ with almost equally balanced extroversion and introversion.  Some ENFJs are very extroverted and always stay in the extroverted style mindset, some ENFJs are mostly ENFJs but they get into an introverted mood so often that they feel like INFJs several times per month regardless of the environment and so on.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat I am trying to say is the line between extroversion and introversion is a line of illusion, it is not objective, but entirely subjective.  Now the subjective nature does not mean the word has no meaning or importance, sometimes it is useful to use words like extroversion and introversion even if you can't objectively define the word.\n\nI may use the word happy to describe my current mood today at 1 in the morning.  I may also use the word happy to describe my mood yesterday at the same time 24 hours earlier.  But what I am feeling may not be the same, but happy was the closest word that came to my mind and even though happy is a subjective term it communicates information to you.  If no extra information is required the ambiguity is fine even if it does not describe the subjective experience perfectly.  But sometimes I need followup and a significant other may ask more questions like do you feel anything else or can you use other words to describe how you feel.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI am personally not bipolar, and I have double the life experience on you at 31 instead of 16.  But I think I can empathetically relate to you, and I think you can relate to me empathetically.  It is not about what you brought up, but here is a short video relating to some of the neuroanatomy and stuff with ADHD and emotions and moods.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/az-nfET7mBM?list=PLzBixSjmbc8cGW9p3-elS6uDHv7T0Z2vp&t=6\n\nHe is talking about a brain area called the greater limbic area.  Aka this picture.  This brain area has lots to do with emotion, feelings, and mood.\n\nhttps://o.quizlet.com/bGkAr7BSWqKwUwfmA5dY0A.png\n\nBut he is contrasting certain parts of the limbic brain.  Certain parts of the limbic brain are more tied to feelings, others are tied more to emotional and quick responses, others try to figure out what to do with both the moods and the emotional and quick responses (but also other inputs such as sensory information, cognition, and so on.)  Aka the limbic system can be subdivided into more brain areas such as these areas\n\nhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/classconnection/64/flashcards/261064/jpg/1-149C9A15470762672EA.jpg\n\nAnd also other areas are important such as these areas red is the insula, green is the operculum (frontal area / parietal area), blue is the operculum (frontal / temporal area)\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Human_brain_frontal_%28coronal%29_section_description2.JPG/250px-Human_brain_frontal_%28coronal%29_section_description2.JPG\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAll of this is not to show off brain areas or to talk about bipolar and ADHD but instead to talk about empathy and so on, and how we are all the same but also similar, and to explain to other people we need to see we are like X but we are also different in these ways, A, B, and C.\n\nHopefully what I am trying to say is helping you feel more connected and less isolated, for I understand how much mental health sucks when it is not being completely treated, and your anxiety, and stuff like depression just makes you feel so not connected to the greater world that part of you wants to be connected to.
1	Not throwing shade at you at all, but I think a better source of your time would be spent conquering the problems you're facing. I know that's easier said than done; there's nothing more intoxicating than the quest to discover oneself. But you're young; I'm 19, just finished my first year of college, and I still barely know who I am. I remember being 16 and thinking that a person had to have a perfect idea of who they were back then. You won't, you shouldn't, and you can't stress about it. Focus on climbing the mountains you have in front of you; I think that people usually discover themselves when they're faced with obstacles, and yours (I do wish you all the best in improving your mental health, by the way), if you give it enough work, will probably reveal some things about yourself that you've never seen before.\n\nBesides, if you're also worried about "typing" yourself, then don't be. I might catch some flak for this on this sub, but I like spending time here because I can connect with people and share my experiences in a fun, like-minded environment; not because we share some four letter "title." MBTI's a fun little diversion to say "Hah, I'm better at feeling than you" (which does make us superior :) ). Beyond that, eh.\n\nAlthough, feel free to PM me if you wanna talk more. I might not have answered your question at all and just fallen into the typical ENFJ trap of writing a speech to sound profound and motivational.
5	how do i give emotional support	thought this would be a good subreddit to ask since enfjs are Fe doms and r/esfj is a ghost town.\n\nHow can I give emotional support? I am trying to help out my sister (enfp). I am an ISTP and very bad at this. I am not at all emotionally abusive, just very detached from showing emotions. My sister is going through a very hard time and I am trying to be supportive. I feel bad because I am almost unable to help her, idk what to do. It makes me mad that I am unable to help her feel better.\n\nNormally I would give her a hug, but she is very averse to physical touch\n\nalso my love language is touch and hers is quality time (I believe in the love languages theory personally).
12	Is intense attachment and brutal intensity normal for ENFJ?	So I was dating this ENFJ girl. SUPER intense and stubborn (I read that ENFJ can be very intense, hence this post). She likes me a lot as far as I can tell, but I feel like she's suffocating me with constantly needing to be in touch and not understanding boundaries at all. As in, I ask her to give me space, but her idea of giving me space is turning down the non-stop obsession by 10% and that's it. Is this just an ENFJ thing, or is this just her personal trait? Also, I tried cooling her off by sending some pretty negative signals, like telling her I don't feel anything at the moment (having a bit of a rough period myself), I need space, etc., but she just won't let go or give up.\n\nAssuming that this is an ENFJ thing, is this something that changes over time with ENFJ's or is this dynamic "common"? Also, any comments on ENFJ + ENTP couples and how they work in your experience?\n\nThank you.
16	Ugh, so painful to see something toxic.\n\nNo, it's not an ENFJ thing. \n\nIt's a needy/ insecure/ anxious/ depressed person thing. People who don't love themselves will find other people to love them on their behalf. BUT it certainly can be one of the manifestations of an unstable ENFJ.\n\nAnd my personal view is that relationship dynamics don't change if people stay together. Needy people can't unlearn neediness unless it is by the hard way.
9	This sounded normal up until the not getting the negative signals part. ENFJs are super sensitive to others' vibes and would back off at a million miles an hour if they picked these up. The fact she's still ploughing ahead makes me agree with the others that this is an insecure/anxious/depressed trait. Be kind but protect yourself here. 
5	F/ENFJ here. This makes me sad, because I'm always worried that I'm coming across like this. (Although I don't really believe I'm that needy/clingy--just being perceived that way--because like most other ENFJ's I have a pretty full plate All the Time.)  I try to remember to request clear instructions/feedback and to promise that I'll receive it well, but sometimes, in the initial high of getting to know another person, I don't get around to it as quickly as may be required. I'm just so enthusiastic/excited when I meet someone new who I find interesting that I go on auto-chase-pilot.  And since I'm enjoying it, it doesn't occur to me that the other person might find it suffocating--it's like, what???, how could you possibly not LOVE all this sunshine I'm raining down on you??? Lol. Having said all that, when they tell me that they need/want space, or even show me by choosing to spend time with other people or activities over me, I tend to immediately withdraw (feeling hurt/rejected, but whatever, because that only lasts until another friend/loved one shows up).  So, just make sure that you are really communicating clearly to her, not just hinting to save her feelings, and do it in as empathetic a manner as possible, because when our feelings are hurt, we're not hearing you.  :-(   
5	On an unrelated note, as an ISTP lurker I just have to say all your comments are amazing and hearing your thoughts has been valuable to me as well. \n\nPeople who are confident in extroverted feeling are so magical to me. 
3	> ENFJ + ENTP\n\nRelation of benefit.  If you're an ENTP you're like to always feel somewhat taken advantage of or taken for granted.  The temperament difference (ExxJ + ExxP) generally makes these kinds of relationships short-lived.  You would be better off seeking an ISxJ, or at least another IxxJ or ExxP.  The dynamic you describe will likely escalate the closer you get to this girl, especially if she doesn't receive the kind of reassurance from you that she's looking for.\n\nAlso, needing attention in the form of looking at our things, listening to our ideas, providing emotional reassurance, etc. is definitely an ENFJ thing.  ENTPs need just as much attention, but expressed in a different way (ideally the ways Si-doms pay attention to others).  I do agree with u/lawdoodette, though, that not being able or willing to pull back from attention-seeking behavior even when the other person makes it clear that they're unhappy with it is the mark of insecurity/personal issues in ENFJs or any type, which will not help with your relationship dynamic.
1	I have been talking to an ENTP male lately. I definitely get attached quickly, but I agree with one of the other posters. If you gave any indication you weren't interested - I'd run the other way. But yes I wonder whether it is not going to work long term as I like verbal reassurances and I don't think the ENTP man is going to be that person! Might be fun for a while though :)
16	Does any other single ENFJs tend to grasp onto a crush like all the time?	I've notice maybe it's not healthy but I've always grasped onto a crush all the time. For me I always find a girl that I think about who I like. And of course I make a move then get let down when I tell them or ask them and either I make good friends with then or move on. 
5	It's a very common thing, but hey at least you're actually making your feelings known instead of not trying at all.
3	I have this 'problem'. Last time I fell for another ENFJ and that ended horrendously. Now I am crushing on someone else, but don't know her personality. I crush hard...luckily I can set boundaries like /u/Techhead7890 said.
3	[deleted]
2	Non-dominant but heavy user of Fe checking in here: yes, I am a little obsessive with my crushes...\n\nI imagine a healthy dominant-Fe user (ie, a true ENFJ) would set clearer boundaries for themself though, so take my reply with a pinch of salt.\n\nOh, and yeah, I think Fe leads to very honest behaviour like that. We don't like to mess around ;)
2	What do you guys mean by boundaries? 
1	Well it takes me awhile of course I generate a good rapport first. Then tell them took me years to do this. 
7	INFP here, m, 20. Looking for ENFJ friends	(Sorry if this is an annoying kind of post)\nHi,\nMy name is Len, I'm from South Africa. \nIm curious to see if we are as compatable as they say.\nSo if you want an INFP friend add me or message me :) 
1	I'm a bit of both, feel free to PM me :)
3	What do you think about INTPs?	nothing to say here, 
6	I've met a few INTPs in my life, and there's one in particular I'm close to. We had very different ideals and we would always argue but appreciate each other's point of view. He was a good listener as I ranted and talked about my feelings. INTPs are pretty chill, sometimes really weird but good to have as a friend.
3	> Nothing to reply here!\n\nOkay, kidding. So as a Fe-user^% I feel like one of the real downsides of Ti is the dispassionate analysis. Sometimes I feel that ethics just isn't as important to an INTP as it would be to me - maybe this is just bad sampling as I can't think of many INTPs I know irl off the top of my head, and maybe the people I have labelled as such are actually eeebil INTJs with their Te. (idk...)\n\nBy contrast I think one of the strengths of the Ti/Fe pairing is the natural cuteseyness and naivety that Ti can bring out. It's certainly possible Ti-types get an undeservedly-bad rap as super-nerds or unexpressive adrenaline junkies (more ISTP there). I usually find /r/INTP interesting, if not a little excessively populated with DAE DAE DAE posts. That gets a little tiring to sift through.\n\nI think that's it but I will definitely do my best to reply if you have further queries, because half a sentence is not a lot to go off :P\n\n%: Note, it's theoretically tertiary in my stack, assuming I'm actually ENTP these days, but I'm a personwho currently can't make their mind up where it lies in their secondary pair of aux/tert. I could either be using alongside dom-Ne as tert-Fe; I could possibly be using it enthusiastically, as aux-Fe, with dom-Ni, so they obey the 'consecutive functions must have the opposite direction' rule. It's complicated!
3	I'm dating an INTP and I love it. It's challenging in all the right ways, I think there needs to be a great deal of maturity and communication though, because the function stacks are so polar opposite. However, the one trait we share is Intuition, which is fundamental because it allows us to analyze and understand each other's differences. With the right kind of communication that allows for discussions utilizing our intuition nature to work out problems, then ENFJ's and INTP's go AMAZINGLY together because our greatest strengths are the other's greatest weaknesses. Without the right kind of communication though, it can easily go down in flames. 
2	I don't know if I actually know any INTPs irl so it's hard for me to say. From what I've read I imagine I'd have a difficult time relating to them. But it's impossible to say without actually interacting with one. 
1	INTPs are my fave.  My best friend is an intp and everything that comes out of his mouth is interesting.  We compliment each other very well haha
1	We have the best conversations, hands down. INTPs are so good at dissecting my jumbled up thoughts. So good to have discussions about theoretical and abstract subjects with. So good at picking up on implied meaning!! Great listeners. Brilliant minds.
9	What gifts do you like?	I want to give an ENFJ something that shows how much i appreciate her, she has boosted my self esteem by miles but im kinda shy so I im asking you guys
9	What's her love language?\n\nA lot of ENFJs have words of affirmations as it. If hers is the same, a heartfelt letter of why you appreciate her and exactly how your self esteem has become better would be so appreciated!
4	It depends on her interests. Anything that shows someone knows me really well and pays attention to the kinds of things I like are my favorite gifts. For instance, I collect Disney trading pins and recently my husband got me a new pin display board as a just because gift. It was extra sweet because I was running out of room on my old board and he noticed and got me a new one without me saying anything. What are her interests and hobbies? 
4	Usually lapdances cut to the core of us and bring out the water works. A Truly heartfelt lapdance shows that you listen and have enough money to pay for a stripper
3	Definitely agree with giving her something related to her interests. I personally love it when I get thoughtful gifts because I love to give thoughtful gifts. The best ones I have ever received are from people who took the time notice things I liked to do/see/eat etc.\n
3	Hugs... So many hugs... Also something that shows that you know what my interests are, even if they're very different from yours. For example, I would be thrilled if one of my non-techie friends got me a techie gift. 
3	I love gifts that pertain to the things I absolutely LOVE! My mom got me sloth sheets because my old sheets ripped and she totally didn't have to BUT THEY WERE PERFECT I LOVE SLOTHS\n\nThat said, it doesn't always have to be stuff! A heartfelt or cute card or a box of brownies does the trick just fine :) \n\n*Edit - Can I just add that THE SLOTHS WERE ON BICYCLES
2	My absolute favorite gifts are the ones that remind me of a shared experience. I watched Rogue One with a dear friend of mine and for Xmas he gave me a K2SO funko pop figure. I like Star Wars as much as the next girl, but the fact that it reminds me of a fun evening we had together makes it even more special. 
8	How do ENFJs show and feel Empathy?	I am an INFP. When someone is opening up to me about something painful, I always try to make them feel better and try to level with them and show them that they are not alone.\n\nI do like to think I'm an empathetic person, but my brain is wired to be Fi. So often times I wonder if I'm simply mirroring their emotions (as theory suggests) rather than truly being able to empathize with them?\n\nSince you all are the masters of empathy, I thought there is no better place to ask:\n\nHow is true empathy supposed to feel like?\n\nHow do you respond when someone is sharing something painful. How do you show empathy to them?\n\nIs there any way I can learn to empathize like an ENFJ?
8	Showing empathy and feeling empathy are two very different things. I'm incredibly empathetic in a way I can't turn off or really explain. When someone is hurting I'm hurting too. I can't help it it's just the way my brain and body work. Seeing other people cry makes me cry for example. As for showing it though that's something that comes with patience and practice and a willingness to face the pain instead of trying to mask or ignore it. 
3	Empathy is putting yourself in someone's shoes. The idea is, ENFJ's do this without realizing it or being able to help it. It feels horrible sometimes, so when we express or reflect emotion at people, it's because we really feel what they might be feeling. \n\nThis isn't all the time, though. A few people in my life have crossed a line where they're not allowed in my Empathy Shoe Closet anymore. I avoid putting myself in their shoes and thus feeling bad for them by figuratively slamming the door in their face and letting them stay outside my mind. \n\nSo yeah lol
2	[deleted]
2	Sometimes I am in a lot of pain and start crying when my mom tells me sad stories she heard on the news. It is horrible. 
1	Are ENFJs really suppose to be the most empathetic type? My boyfriend and my bestfriend are ENFJs, and I don't find them so good at empathy...When I am troubled, or there is something wrong i my life, or when i doubt myself, they really are not the first ones I go to to talk... There sure have no patience for rants, negativity or listening to someone complaining about something in their life...Still ! They are the kind of people I connect with the most! Love Enfjs !\n\nPs.: Im INFP
5	ENFJ losing interest in INFP	Hi! I'm an Infp and my friend set me up with an Enfj.\nWe started texting only for a few days. I was really awkward at first, but then it got better and I really started to like him. Though, just yesterday we went on a date or whatever and I was shy again and I just felt like a bore. \nAnd now, --and I know I'm really overthinking this--, but his pattern changed. I'm worried he's lost interest. He stopped asking how I was (which he did often and I read it was really natural for ENFJ to do this; a tell that they liked you/have interest in you). He always replied in ten minutes to mintues and now takes forever to respond and I really just get the feeling he's not interested.\nIs there any way to fix this?
8	INFP with an ENFJ boyfriend.\n\nI feel you. We are awkward peeps. But definitely communication is big role between these two types. ENFJ's do not like taking on confrontation and will be quiet about it unless it is something that you address with them. If you feel that you certainly have feelings for this guy and want to give it try to make it work, then I'd ask him if everything is okay because you've noticed some changes. Being straight up honest about how you're feeling on his actions is the best route. It'll help him see where you're at and why you're feeling the way that you do. Hit him up, let him know, and hopefully he gives you a response. If not, guuuurllll bye.
8	ENFJ here with a INFP girlfriend. \n\nAll this checks out. Something is definitely going on with his side of things. I'd just ask him. ENFJs suck at confrontation and will avoid it. So I'd just be straight up with him and ask him if everything is good between you two.
5	ENFJ here. \n\nSound like he's not interested. And once were not interested, any attempt to win us back will come across as obnoxious and annoying.  \n\nI'd say try to Move on. 
4	I'm an ENFJ with an INTJ partner and my closest friends are INFJs. I taught myself to stop avoiding confrontation and to be more assertive (infinitely healthier than resorting to passive aggressive "communication" method the way I was raised with, ugh). \n\nBeing assertive and unafraid of (kind) confrontation is a big part of why my relationships with introverts function well. Before I learned to do this, I didn't have full or well-developed relationships introverts in my life (and certainly not romantic ones). \n\nOver-reliance on intuition is not healthy, and my introverted friends depend on my willingness to breach subjects. I encourage the introverts in my life to speak up more!  ENFJs can sense a lot, but we can't read minds :)
2	One small thing caught my interest on this older post, and it was that he stopped asking how you were. Do you ask him how he is? On a level beyond small talk? ENFJ's do genuinely get interested in the lives of other people, which is why we often come across as so socially bubbly, we genuinely care about the answer when you tell you us how you are and what's going on. But sometimes, when it feels like people rely on us to make the first moves socially because we are normally so bold in that realm, it can get old. 
7	What does inferior Ti feel/look like?	As someone who has tertiary Ti I'm curious to know more about inferior Ti. I know stress for any type triggers them to be in the "grip" but what sort of things trigger this? How does having inferior Ti impact your everyday life? 
4	It most strongly comes out as self criticism 
2	INTP with Dominant Ti slowly walks out the post.\n\n*tip toe*
2	I withdraw/isolate myself from others, stare at the ceiling/the mirror for hours, and lay in bed and overanalyze a lot. I'm also a type 4 on the enneagram so maybe that influences things.\n\nEssentially it's just a negative cycle of self condemnation where I criticize myself with statements that are pretty illogical and unrealistic, usually concerning things that impact my relationships. For example, "I'm so unlovable because of xyz. No one will ever love me" even though there are people texting me at that very moment...Then I'll cry a lot because the emotions that come out of such thoughts are so intense and then I condemn myself more for being so weak that I could let myself get in this place because my depression will hurt other people and so I withdraw more so that I don't affect others, which actually makes things worse.
6	How do you make people confortable?	ENFJs are well-known for their warmth and ability to make everyone feel at ease. How do you do that? Any advice?
16	* Smile!\n\n* Approach them first and take control of the tone of the conversation. Set a pleasant and upbeat tone.\n\n* Introduce yourself and share personal information about yourself — be vulnerable first!\n\n* When they share something personal, make sure you comment in a way to show them that they are not judged.\n\n* Return the favour and share something even more personal — better if it was embarrassing, silly on your part.\n\n* Don't make it all about yourself. Ask open-ended questions about them!\n\n* Don't press anything they don't want to talk about, \n\n* But still egg them on by being genuinely interested in what they say.\n\n* Dispel uncomfortable feelings with honesty — "well that's awkward/ it must have been a not nice time for you/ well fuck that loser, you're better off now."
3	My husband is an ENFJ. I'm SO jealous of his ability to reel people in with his charm, and make them feel comfortable. It also puts a shine on how awarkard I can be when I can't keep up with him socially 
3	Show people that you're interested! That's the number one thing! Also, move past small talk quickly. Try to find a common interest quickly to latch on to, and then use that to explore other topics of conversation. Also, look up "social onion theory". Human's are like onions, as we get to know people we peel back layers of ourselves. Share something about yourself that somebody wouldn't know just by looking at you, and they automatically reciprocate, it's a social instinct. (Of course, don't cut your freaking onion core in half by sharing your deepest darkest secrets, people won't reciprocate that fast lol)
2	I find that people are comfortable around me because I'm genuinely interested in what they have to say. Being a good listener can go a long way. It also helps to be comfortable around them. If you're not comfortable why should they be? 
2	I share part of myself, am open, which makes people feel more at ease with me
1	I feel like it's an integrated nature inside ENFJs, they are felt warm and natural whenever you encounter them. 
1	1 read books on it.  \nit never ends really  \n\n---\n\n2 to make people at ease you have to speak to their reptilian brain, meaning focus on becoming a friend not a foe, someone who doesnt want to disturb. you can always go from the highest sensitivity level, like speaking to a man who just fainted, and escalating if his resources can take it 
12	Social Awareness and Being ENFJ	So are ENFJs socially aware or not? I feel like we are but aren't at the same time. I've been told by people that I'm either extremely aware or not aware at all. But then when I observe those people who tell me that I have bad awareness, I feel like they do not have awareness either...\n\nI also do think awareness, to a certain degree, is subjective and based on the culture you grew up in. Your life experiences will definitely play a part in what you think is socially appropriate. But there still is the objective ability to read a person in the moment and gauge their emotional responses. \n\nBut anyway, I don't know about the rest of you, but if I were to evaluate myself, I would say that I'm very aware in the sense that I'm good at reading people "beneath the surface" but because I'm so focused on that at times, I can miss out on what's going on with the situation/environment. I've been studying personality psychology for almost 2 years now and I can definitely type people quite accurately from just a few conversations with ease and then adjust my behavior to them accordingly. However, I catch myself saying dumb things or acting inappropriately when I get too excited in moments, which I then quickly apologize for it and then go home and slip into self-criticism mode.\n\nBut in the end, who is perfect at this stuff anyways? We all make mistakes at times. Let me know what you guys think!! :)
10	I can totally relate.\n\nTo simplify it, I think I am **hyper sensitive to the emotional atmosphere of the room**, but also **completely oblivious to actual events that are happening in the same room**.\n\nSo, at a gathering, I could probably very quickly sense that Anna feels left out and nervous that Bella left her to talk to Christina...without noticing that it's because Anna had insulted Bella 2 days ago at a lunch I was at. \n\nI pay attention so much attention to the emotional nuances of a person that I sometimes completely miss their actions/ the context/ events that have happened.....
5	I agree with basically everything you said here.  I would consider myself very socially aware.  I can pretty easily tell what people are feeling under the surface, like if two people like each other, or if someone in the group is getting on other people's nerves.  I spend most of my time in groups watching and listening to what other people say or do.\n\nButtttttt.  When I decide to respond to someone because I have something relevant to add, I can get carried away by my emotions and end up saying or doing something dumb.  I have major foot-in-mouth syndrome.  I try my very best not to be hard on myself when this happens, and I'm extra lucky to have friends who are very understanding.
2	Need some help from my ENFJ family	I don't know if it's just me but I feel like it's something ENFJs struggle with at some level. \n\nWe care about people some way or another but they have proven time and time again that they do not care about us the way that we do or maybe manipulate you into believing that they do and you justify their mixed behavior repeatedly. \n\nMan I have the hardest time cutting people out of my life that treat me terribly. Or just letting go..\n\nIt's like they can do a million terrible things and give me so many reasons for why I should never even bother with them again but then I start thinking about them and think of good qualities in them and how much time I have spent of my life on them and I just can't freaking move on. \n\nIt's honestly the most frustrating feeling wondering why I STILL care and if they were to need my help or someone to be there why I STILL would.\n\nI try to figure out what went wrong or what I can do to salvage the relationship because how can things just end and you never talk to someone again? It also drives me crazy thinking about the things that I contributed to it ending and it's almost like I still need some type of closure even though I know deep down. \nMaybe this is all sounding so confusing and not relatable at all. It's just frustrating to me how I feel like other types can just completely cut someone from their life, move on and not give a crap about what a person thinks of them, what they are up to, etc. \n\nI need some help from ENFJs who have ended romantic relationships especially or any relationship and just the process by which you find it helps you to move on. I'm just so tired of feeling like an idiot and I just wish I didn't feel this way. I want to feel like maybe I am not alone in this and someone else gets it. What type of things do you recognize in yourself that would be helpful for me to know when trying to get through this. Any advice would be appreciated! 
2	Okay. I'm literally doing exactly what you're trying to do, so bear with me while I tell you what's working:\n\n- Avoid. All. Contact. It sucks and it's hard but it's worth it. Delete numbers, block on social media. \n\n- Walk and talk. Exercise if you have the time, and make sure it's something fun and dynamic: go for a walk with a friend and vent, join yoga at your community center. Just don't isolate yourself. Nature is there for you.\n\n- Accept that people will want to help you with this, but you need to seek them out first. It can be hard for people to understand what we go through if we don't show them–furthermore, you have to show these people you want their advice and affection: otherwise, neither party will get anything out of it. Don't be afraid to seek professional counseling.\n\nThe biggest thing that rings true for me in what you've written is the "how-can-it-just-be-done" philosophy. I have a hard time understanding why friendships in particular have to discontinue. And with any type of relationship... how can someone just be there, and then they're not? Wasn't the time we had together special?\n\nBut I know, deep down, I haven't been wronged. Neither have you. For one reason or another these people were bad for us at this time in our lives. Maybe the universe thought the relationship had to go. Maybe *you* thought so. Maybe *they* thought so, which is just as valid. For now, we have to embrace it and live our lives with the opportunity this presents.\n\nI wish I (we?) didn't feel this way either, buddy. But I'm proud of us for recognizing how crappy stuff is, and most importantly, for taking the first steps toward moving on. Fuck, I'm not gonna move *on.* I'm gonna move *up.* \n\n*drops mic*\n\nPM me if you wanna be miserable together lol
1	my coping mechanisms with moving on from relationships:\n-plenty of distractions: video games, movies, etc.\n-friends: hanging out with a ton of people and focus on the positives. Vent a ton, but no more than for a couple of weeks.\n-self improvement: analyze why things didn't go well and learn from them.  Improve in my areas of weakness and learn to avoid a certain characteristic of the ex in my next partner.\n-Disconnecting from the person: if things don't work out, can't dwell on who's at fault. If you know you did wrong, take responsibility/accountability and never do it again.  "The decisions you make and the actions you take are a reflection of who you are."\n-date a ton of people: I rebound a lot and sure people can look down on it, but my philosophy is why waste time mourning a break up for 6 months when you can utilize that time to find someone who works with you.  That is, unless things ended mutually with the ex and you are staying single out of respect and feelings.\n\nIt took me years to develop the ability to cut someone off without any residual negativity.  One of my friendships that ended badly took me two years to get over all the negative feels I had for them. I desperately wanted to save the friendship/relationship of people whom I created strong bonds with.\n\nPeople come and go in my life.  That's a fact I accept.  My life is basically a book where each chapter is a person who was a part of my life.  The chapter can be long or short, but just because it ends, doesn't mean my book will end.\n\nWhen I make the choice to cut someone out of my life, it's because I know they are too toxic to keep in my life.  If they cut me out, then it's their choice.  You can't force ships between you and other people.  It must be mutual.\n\nHow do I not care about what other people think of me? How do I not care about what an ex is doing?\n\nI look at the facts.  Worrying is an improper use of imagination.  What's going on in other peoples' worlds have nothing to do with mine.  Knowing what the other people are thinking or doing isn't any of my business.  What would be the point in knowing if it just ends up hurting my feelings?  Wanting to know why things ended the way they do for closure is normal, but once the ship is ended, these people owe me nothing.\n\nI've dated and had a ton of relationships so this is all coming from experience.  Honestly it will take a while to attain this level of thinking. You have to get out of the victimization mindset.  There's nothing wrong with wanting to help, but if you're feeling miserable about it, it's better to back off instead of stressing about it.\n\nPrime ex: I had a friend who was an askhole.  Kept on coming to me with the same issues, and would continually throw me under the bus.  Eventually, I realized that nothing I say or do can help this person because they won't help themselves. \n\nI hope this helps, I haven't felt what you felt for maybe 3 or 4 years.  I'm definitely a lot more happier not giving people who don't treat me right the time of day and to not take things personally with people I don't give a shit about.
12	Is being an ENFJ a bad thing?	So I just recently ended a relationship with a guy who was actually the polar opposite of me, being an ISTP, and he mentioned several times that my "people pleasing" nature rubbed him the wrong way. Not only that, but that I was way too clingy and emotional for him. It sucks. \n\nI used to think being an ENFJ was something to be proud of, but now I'm just always thinking about this in the back of my mind, and I'm starting to kind of hate it. It really does seem fake and shallow now. Like we're just looking for people to like us or something. \n\nAre there any traits about being an ENFJ that really suck for you sometimes?
19	I don't think being any of the 16 types is a bad thing. Every single type has positive tendencies and negative tendencies. Sure, some ENFJs can be shallow and tell people what they want to hear (not my experience but I could see it happening). I personally can get jealous, clingy, and overbearing sometimes. But I also have a talent for communicating really well one-on-one, cheering people up, and creating a fun dynamic in group situations. \n\n\nJust because there are some things someone doesn't like about you doesn't mean you should be ashamed of your type. Focus on your strengths. Be the best person you can be. Don't let the things you or others perceive to be negative about you get you down. Nobody's perfect, but usually the good outweighs the bad :)
12	What's wrong with wanting people to like you? Everybody wants to be liked to some degree, we're just better at actually achieving those results. And I'd argue we're one of the least shallow types out there because we have a genuine desire to understand people and bring out the best in them. I love being an ENFJ and just because one ISTP (polar opposite preferences mind you) didn't understand or appreciate you doesn't mean nobody will.
12	As an ISTP, I absolutely adore ENFJs as a broad category. \n\nPeople pleasing, clinging and emotionality all inclusive. \n\nI'd wager there was personal baggage being expressed by your ISTP. 
11	Sometimes things are not good together. However, it doesn't mean they're not good on their own. Think of idk chocolate milk and mayo. Both are great. Both are good. But if you mix them together, that's really gross. \nENFJs are good, but maybe they just don't mix good with everyone. ISTPs are not really good with emotions, so it makes sense that one could think that ENFJs are too much. But it doesn't mean you're too much, you're maybe just too much for them. If you really feel like pleasing people when you do, then you know it's not fake. You shouldn't let your ex get to your head. It really just sounds like your differences made it impossible for you relationship to work. \nI'm not ENFJ, but as an INFP I have to say that I find ENFJ's nature very sweat and comforting. Most people don't even try to be nice and ENFJs seem to live for it. There is something honorable in it. 
8	being an ENFJ isn't a bad thing as much as it's bad not being able to love yourself without external validation.  If this person doesn't appreciate you for who you are, it's not your problem.  I can see trying to please people may come off the wrong way because people can view it as "attention seeking" with a lack of "self".  There is some ingenuity with those actions in a sense because people pleasing to up your ego is a common trait in ENFJs.  However, if you are doing things out of the goodness of your own heart, there's really nothing wrong with it.  You just have to realize you need to be able to validate and affirm yourself without really caring what other people think.  It's like, you're helping someone who's down and another person is telling you you're being stupid for doing it. To the person you're helping, you're doing tons and are a good person.  To the person criticizing you, you're shallow...\n\nNot everyone is going to like your personality and if you let every negative comment bring you down, you'll end up being suffocated by people who you don't need in your life.  
6	As an INFP I can relate a little, as my type has some very strong draw backs that people don't understand and that I sometimes feel very frustrated with. It is really easy to hate myself for it and just become miserable and angry. But, this past year I have learned something beautiful. All personality types excell at something, in  my own terminology I call it a superpower. As an INFP I excell at empathy, I constantly feel for other people. Now I know ENFJs are simmilar, but you do it in another method, where we relate to ourselves and past experiences, you do it in relation to people around you. As both our groups are intuitives we look at in a more abstract way, which simply means we read between the lines and have the ability to predict how things will impact the future, although we do this radically differently. Now let's take this superpower, and let's make it so powerful you can't turn it off. Now every personalities superpower is this powerful, our brains use it without our conscious agreement to it, and shutting it down is not healthy. Now when there is a little stress or when things are a little out of the comfort zone of this superpower speciality area things go a little haywire. Interstingly INFPs and ENFJs share a similar response, because our fourth functions are thinking functions. See, we do best when  we listen to our gut and when we don't have to think too rationaly. We can think rationaly about most things, in fact we can think rationaly about everything - except when it comes to ourselves. Now INFPs use Te, which looks at the bigger scheme of things and we start feeling isolated and squashed and life seems meaningless. All those things our superpower usually loves looking at, is now turned on  its head by the fourth function in the driver seat and makes everything grim and helpless. Now ENFJs have Ti, which looks inward in a way and starts picking things apart. When this combines with your superpower that is able to always put everything into relation with everything else, and at its strongest with people, you can see how things can go wrong. You always see the good sides of other people, because people hate sjowing the worst. You then look inside and see bad thoughts and selfishness and some desires that can feel out of control sometimes. You can easily compare yourself to others and all you see is a very bad person compared to very good other people. You start picking yourself apart and you just see wrong things in yourself everywhere and you literaly become your worst enemy. A typical ENFJ response is to just get busy and not think of things, and this prolongs any healthy mental state as the issues never get dealt with. \n\n\nSo enough with all this theory that I have devised, let me have some solutions. Firstly, everyone thinks the same and feels the same, those dark thoughts, those selfish desires all all the same everywhere, and you can accept them and you can be selfish sometimes, becaus what you consider selfish most other people consider self preservation and is expected of you. Secondly, move away from those very critical thoughts and people that encourage them, look at the shadows of superpower and see that you are terrible sometimes because there is something really good in you. Embrace it in a way and learn to notice that it comes up and instead of repressing it, guide it. I think for and ENFJ with very strong Fe the best way to do this is to share your dark terrible feelings with someone safe, someone not involved in the situation and someone that will understand. You actually don't really need someone to give in put, because as you talk things will come together in your mind and things will make more sense. If you can't find someone you can probably talk to an object, like a doll or something, as an INFP I do this all the time, and it works wonders.\n\nAlright, this has been a long post but in short - You have an incredible superpower that can get a little overwhelming sometimes. It is not a bad thing, and in fact I am sure you are a wonderful person.\n\n\nIn my own  opinion - you can't trust an ISTP on any matter relating to social correctness, relation health or any kind of deep emotional matter - it is simply out of their scope of logic, especially when they are younger.
4	I think you need to 'look away' from mbti for the time being\n\nAppreciate you for you.\n\nGo back to 'heart', be present with what you're good at and love to do.\n\nYou are smart, colorful and full of energy.\n\nNow go forth, leave the past behind. You are a new person today
2	Just don't let your need for harmony lead you to control, if something feels like it isn't something you wanna do, don't. Wait for the right moment, be at peace with yourself. Don't do something simply because it needs to be done. If that's one end of the spectrum, the other is, don't "don't give a fuck", you do, wait, take a step back, disappear, go into hiding, but deal with yourself, first, and remember, you're no Wolverine, if you're gonna save Jean Grey, you're gonna have to wait either till she's done burning the world apart, or for a Wolverine to step in.\n\nYou can always be there "after", don't "I don't want you to fall", warn, and back off if you have to, catch, if you can, don't spare hands to catch, wait, use your J, is this person worth the effort? Does this situation demand "saving"? Use your Ti, that's your J, really. You know you aren't born a Gorilla, but a pup. Understand until you can judge, and strike a balance, really, that's the key.\n\nIn moments like these, remember Po. Don't be Shifu. That's the Oogway.\n\nPeace! <3
2	Oh wait, just read the entire problem.\n\nOne person's (lack of) consent doesn't make you not who you are, in fact, someone's consent does not make you who you are not.\n\nYou "want people to like you or something" because someone told you, you were. But is that really why? And if it were, is it such a bad thing? Only if it comes at the cost of self esteem. Why would someone not want you to want them to like you? If they didn't, they have issues. Leave them be. And if they have a problem with you, they have a problem with you. That doesn't make you any different, it just means they don't like you for who you are. So should you change? If you did, then you really aren't who you are, then who are you?\n\nNo one, then can you, as no one, do anything? No one can. Ha!\n\nAll of your problems with yourself have been caused by another, is the problem you? No, it came from outside, let them go, be at peace with yourself, and find your way. You are who you are. There is nothing shallow or fake with that. <3
1	It shouldn't be, but in a world of selfish cynical people who don't care about others... hard to feel like we belong.
1	No!! You guys are definitely people people, but thats a great thing.\n\nI really love the social energy you guys put out.\n\nI'm an INTP just coming out of a relationship with an ENFJ. She is a wonderful woman, and is not deserved by the people around her; she makes great effort in her personal relationships, which is really heartwarming and endearing. It breaks my heart when people don't reciprocate to the same degree.
1	am istp\n\nidk, i like enfjs, when they are mentally stable\n\nI have straight up asked a few of them why they are so needy and then blocked them lol
1	Of course not. You might think that wanting people to like you is a bad thing, but that's what dominant-Fe does. \n\nYou naturally want you and other people to get along and be nice and happy with one another, something that an INTP (with inferior-Fe) such as myself, desires yet struggles with.
1	How old are you guys?
0	No. Being ESFJ is though. 
14	Unsticking a Feeling	Have you ever been in a situation where you're feeling an uncomfortable, unpleasant, or confusing feeling, and even though you know it "doesn't make sense", you can't seem to get unstuck from it?\n\nThis is a result of our ignoring Fi making faulty judgments.  Trying to use Ti (logic and reason) to unstick these emotions is actually counterproductive, for two reasons.  One, because Ti and Fi are "vital functions", we don't have the ability to consciously switch between the two.  And second, because Ti suppresses Fi, but the second we stop Ti-ing, we start Fi-ing again - so if the Fi judgment was wrong before, it'll still be wrong as soon as it comes back.\n\nThink of these faulty judgments as a leaky pipe, but the leak is so small that we can't really tell where it's coming from, so the whole pipe just feels kind of wet and "not right".  Trying to use Ti - to logic ourselves out of the emotions - is like shutting off the water.  It solves the leak, sure, but it creates a bigger problem - we can't function without water running through the pipe like it's supposed to.\n\nSo if you had a leaky pipe, and you couldn't identify the source, what's the solution?\n\nYou have to increase the water pressure.  Increase the flow of information through Fi, find where the leak is, and patch it up.\n\nHow do you do that?  There's a natural order of information flow from one function to the other.  It's a full cycle, but the relevant piece in this discussion is vulnerable -> ignoring -> auxiliary.  So Si activates our Fi, which activates our Ni.  In order to increase the water flow to Fi, we have to turn the water pressure up - to activate Si.\n\nLuckily, Si and Ni are "mental functions" - unlike Ti and Fi, we have the ability to consciously switch between the two.  Si is our vulnerable function, so we use it as little as possible, but in this situation it's important to try to use it as much as possible.  The way I tried that worked is to try to remember other times in my life where I felt the same way as the feeling I'm trying to solve.  Often I can't even identify the feeling perfectly with words, and that's okay, you don't need to - you just need to find its shape and then sort through your memories and find that shape in your past experiences.  It may help to tell someone about these memories or to describe them in a journal.  Just talk about what happened using concrete details.  This is Si activating Fi.\n\nFi is largely unconscious, so you're not going to be aware of the judgments it's making.  But what you will be aware of is the *effects* of these judgments on Ni.  Suddenly, your feelings will start to make sense - you'll begin to understand what they *mean*.  This is Fi activating Ni.\n\nOnce you understand what your feelings mean, then you will easily and naturally figure out what the logical next step is - what you should do, or how things will or should go from here.  This is Ni activating Ti.  Things will seem clear and comfortable again - meaning, in the realm of your understanding and capabilities.\n\n**TL;DR - when you feel a weird feeling that doesn't make sense, talk to someone or journal about experiences you've had in the past that made you feel the same way.  This will "unstick" your mind, make you feel better, and give you the energy to move forward in your day/life.**
2	Why does Si -> Fi -> Ni -> Ti? I've never heard or read this before and I'm not sure how it fits into my theoretical model... although your explanation sounds logical.\n\nWhen I get stuck on feelings, it's generally an uncomfortable irritation/unease I can't explain. My Fe fights my Fi as I'm not sure I'm justified in my feelings, and so it takes time and extra Se info for my Ni to get a proper picture on why I'm struggling, to be able to find words to understand it. I do not find it easy to access past emotions through Si at all, rather I keep an eye on my current emotional responses in order to determine patterns from that.
2	This is a great post; as a dominant Fi (INFP) I do those things you listed in your TL:DR to release the same unease feelings. (I'm saying this to recommend it as successful strategy from someone ruled by Fi) Journaling very helpful, talking it through with someone, sitting an ruminating a while until what's in my head makes sense. I'll often research it too if needing more insight. \n\nI find Fi exhausting sometimes though, I wonder if you guys feel the same with it being your 5th function? I don't know if this analogy is correct, but I think our Fi dominates us the way your Fe dominates you - you maybe couldn't relax if there was conflict in your external relationships until you'd sorted it out? Similarly with Fi, I maybe can't function externally until I sort my head out - it's distracting like someone banging a drum right next to my ear all day. But with your Fe you often have to think 'enough keeping others happy - this is getting too burdensome and toxic'. Similarly with Fi, you sometimes realise that you can't fix every bad feeling inside you, and undo all your childhood wounds or whatever you're focusing on, and you just need to stop thinking because it's getting destructive. Maybe it's perfectionism in our types that cause this to happen?\n\nHow do you guys switch off your Fe when it gets too much? I switch off Fi by doing; fixing up the house, being practical minded, sensor activities I guess. Which is what Viper was saying in OP.
2	This post really resonates with me and is very timely. I could never "will" myself or rationalise my bad feelings. You always have a way with words to make what seems difficult easy to understand.
2	Hey peppermint-kiss, thank you so much for this post!\nIt led me to 'solving' a weird feeling ive been stuck trying to Ti for the last 3 days... by realising that it's me experiencing Fi and therefore being able to recognise when I'm using Fi (and Si) which is H U G E because I haven't been able to relate those functions to myself. It feels like I've just clicked on a new level. \n\nWish we were friends in real life x
5	Where to meet an ENFJ	Since discovering MBTI a couple years ago, I've been   fascinated by the attributes of ENFJ's. You're caring,  intelligent, ambitious, and extend your ideals directly to the world around you by your extroverted nature. Truly remarkable characteristics. As an INFJ (male), I've had this longing to create friendships and relationships with your type since you share the same altruistic compassion and ambition; however, you continue to remain elusive. \n\nWith that said, I was wondering where you all like to spend your time! Obviously it varies from person to person, but share some general ideas of the activities or places you like to take part in, or ways to go about creating a connection with you :) cheers 
10	Don't worry. They'll meet *you*!
6	I always recommend finding a ballroom dance club on campus like tango or swing or something. I was in the Argentine tango club in college and it was mostly extroverts and mostly women so we were always trying to find guys to join.
6	Coffee shops for me. Music shows. Book stores. Cool little pubs. 
4	For me I love coffee shops. I usually study out and about. I'm also at lots of social gatherings for me it's car meets. 
2	Is a classroom setting an option for you?
1	Festivals. Where the fun and adventure is! :P
1	Friend groups that gather together for small little parties, ENFJ's LOVE to get people together and have everyone getting along, I host a small get-together with my friend group every weekend.
11	Do isolated extraverts get fatigued?	I'm personally stuck at home for the weekend with nothing to do. And the family is out working.\n\nI'm so bored I feel tired. Is that normal for you guys?
7	Oh same. I take care to track how much socializing I'm able to get because when I don't feel like I have the ability to connect to people and have felt alone trapped in my head for a week, I get really down and low on energy. And then it becomes hard to start engaging in social situations because I lack the energy to make them happen, which makes it worse.\n\nMy bf is an introvert so he recharges with alone/quiet time, and he told me he feels bad for me when I've had two weeks straight of just chill time after work and on weekend. Cuz when he's tired / low on energy, it's easy to get alone/quiet time. When I need to recharge, I need other people to play ball lol. 
5	Yeah... I feel like I must be "recharging" while lying on my couch half-dead for multiple days in a row, but in the end I just feel worse.
4	this is why I recharge by going into chat rooms and talking to people about video games. otherwise I do enjoy some alone time playing video games while chatting with my irl friends online.
2	[deleted]
1	That happens to me when I'm isolated. I hate being alone it makes me so lethargic 
1	Story of my life. 
1	Yes. I feel so uncomfortable when I'm alone. I don't see it as a bad thing. I just prefer to be in the presence of people. I am much more productive with even just a person sitting across the room from me. I work well at cafes. When I'm alone and I can't find anyone to be around I sometimes end up in my bed for the whole day looking at instagram or YouTube, and daydreaming about my next meal or what I'm going to do later, or the things I want to get done, so that's kind of an issue... 
11	ISTP here, you guys are like aliens lol	Just wanted to say, keep being ENFJs. Someone who I suspect is ENFJ helped me quite a bit in life, getting me a medical diagnosis which has helped me scores in school, and always tries to give me emotional support, which I am not sure how to accept.\n\nIDK if anybody cares about the obscure social gestures many of you do, but occasionally you will change someone's life if you are so invested in them. it makes me feel very grateful because I don't have this in my personality at all
6	> it makes me feel very grateful because I don't have this in my personality at all\n\nWith this post, I think you do ;-)\n\nI think many of us would feel SO over the moon if our friends told us the same thing you just did. I'm already happy because this is a very sweet message/ friendship you have and I'm sure your ENFJ friend appreciates you as well.
2	So you changed your type in 6 days? Lolol
1	This is so sweeeeeeeeeet
3	What do you do for work?	I love seeing how people's MBTI type aligns with their careers. Sorry if this has been done before, but what do you all do for work? Do you like it, or does it clash with your personality?\n\nI've managed a service year program for the last seven years, being lucky enough to guide 25-50 (usually young) participants in giving back to their communities for 11 months every year. I get to plan and lead professional development trainings, connect with local nonprofits for community service projects, and advise members on their next steps. I also get to meet and develop a new team of passionate people every year. I love it!
6	I'm an Editorial Assistant for a children's book publisher and I absolutely love it. I get to be creative, work with authors and illustrators, and be a part of a team that works together to make books that we all care about. The only downside for me is that there is a bit of data organization, but the bulk of my work allows me to interact with other people and create things that are made to engage kids and inspire them :)
4	Teacher ofc. Picked it when I was 4, thought I must have been an idiot so tried everything else until I gave in and went back to study at 24.
3	Your profession is hella appropriate for ENFJ! Also interested to know how you got to this point :-)\n\nI'm a law grad (tomorrow!) and soon-to-be intellectual property lawyer. Trying really hard to get into family law...ironically, because it pays less and is therefore not an area that is by any means popular. It's really the only thing I want to do though.
2	Just curious, did you want to end up in this kind of job, or were you working/studying to do something else, and end up with your current work?
2	I'm a nanny to three kids. I went to school to be a teacher but I had to drop out due to family and financial problems. I taught preschool for a bit then learned I could make way more money as a nanny. I love my job even though it's not what I initially wanted to do. I love watching my charges grow and learn and being an instrumental part in helping them develop into good and kind individuals. 
2	I am a Licensed Mental Health therapist. My favorite is crisis work in the ER. I don't feel burned out by it.... my only frustration are my coworkers at times.
1	physiotherapist :)
5	ENFJ Teen anxiety	Introverted intuition develops throughout our teenage years which can be extremely horrible for extroverted feeling types, such as ourselves. We also may come off as introverts with this anxiety too.\n\nCould this also be the cause of my intrusive thoughts from my intuition?\n\nWe might perceive what would happen, if, lets say I happened to acting a certain way to provoke an individual and see how they react.\n\nExtroverted feeling people love to get reactions out of people, but they also want to feel trusted that people will know they are fooling around with them. And anxiety can twist that aspect badly.
3	My intuition has certainly developed more over the past few years, especially this past year as my final year of high school. \n\nI was really needy and wanted a close friend when I was younger. I was at a new school, my neighborhood best friends had fought/moved away and I had just left my church after feeling like they had grown apart from me. I was searching for a best friend. I was terrified of messing it all up. So I didn't even try. Or when I did, I was so needy that I probably drove people away. And then that was a vicious cycle that ended up not being fixed till I found a mentor and worked on that issue. \n\nIt took a long time. And you are absolutely correct with your last sentence. 
2	talking to this ENFJ feel as if getting attack by a gatling gun	I am pretty sure this is not an ENFJ thing since I got others ENFJs friends who are reeeeeally chill. I think it has to be more about her temperament but I still would like to know your opinions. \n\nThis particular ENFJ gal is 19yo and... damn she must suffer from fragmentitis or something. Her mind goes toooo fast and says multiple things at the same time. I avoid getting overwhelmed by everything she says. I actually asked her directly why she speaks like that and she evaded the question and didn't wanted to bring the thing up cause I don't want to put any pressure on her. I just want to know why is that and if any of you can relate to her then any tips on how to handle it better would be appreciated. 
6	ADHD probably 
5	I do this. Like some sort of hyper chipmunk. Some people are just like this? 
3	Could be ADHD. Not all ENFJ's do this, but I do haha. Extroverted Feelers draw from the environment around them, and sometimes I get so much information my mind can't help but bounce from thing thing. I will be in the middle of a fantastic conversation but then remember something else COMPLETELY fascinating that I need an intense need to express NOW because as an extroverted intuitive feeler, I process information with other people. And sometimes I feel bad for the other people lmao. 
2	my mom is ISTJ and does this, she interrupts herself so often IDK what she is saying half the time lol
23	ENFJ Twin	I have an ENFJ twin - she is the most selfless and caring person I know. Typically she forgets about herself in place of helping others.\n\nYou are all awesome and make the world a better place. \n\nThank you.\n\n
10	Excellent, the plot to fool the masses is working. Nobody suspects the ENFJ evil plan.... mwahahahahaha.\n\nNobody will see the takeover coming!
3	INTJ/ENFJ\n\n...ARE THE BEST FRIEND COMBO EEVVEERRRRRRR >:D
1	Awwwwww\n\nThank you too\n\nMake sure you tell her as well
15	New ENFJ Goal: being more decisive	Just had a really eye-opening experience with my boyfriend that I thought maybe some people here could relate to. It was our anniversary celebration, and because he had planned out a whole day for Valentines, it was my turn to plan a date day. \n\nWhen I plan out activities or events, my natural thing I do is get several options of, "We could do this or this, and then we can go do this or this or this, and then we can do dinner but I'm going to talk with him about where he wants to eat, and then we can go back to the house and do this and we'll figure out exactly how we do it." \n\nAnd at the end of the day, we were having a serious discussion about the relationship in general, (not bad or negative, just honest communication), and he mentioned that he was super super happy and had a great day but he was a little dissapointed because it felt like I left a lot of stuff up to him and maybe didn't want to plan it out as much as he had planned out previous dates. \n\nThat was really shocking to me, but it made sense, and I talked it through with him, and really became motivated to set this new goal. In my mind, instead of coming up with three or four activities to do, I put in the work to come up with like eight different options of activities for us to do. And it hurt that it wasn't taken that way, but I understand why it wouldn't naturally be taken that way. \n\nAs an ENFJ, a type that prioritizes social harmony above anything else, I genuinely don't typically care what I'm doing with someone as long as I'm around that person and engaging with them and making them happy, (unless it's a specific event I'm super excited for). And whenever I do have to make plans with friends or plan out a date, I'm more than happy to give different things I would like to do, but getting that confirmation of "yes, this is the thing I would like to do the most" makes me feel good because I feel like I'm maximizing the potential to make the other person happy. Whereas on the flip side of the coin, if someone is always doing that, it could probably seem like they just didn't like to plan things or take charge. \n\nWhile I'm not that person who responds with "I don't care what we do" to everything, (we ALL hate that person), in my life I am the person who will list three or four different places to eat as options but then won't actually pick one myself and wait for you to do it. And that can be just as exhausting to deal with sometimes, which is why I'm personally making a goal to start being the person who says, "Let's go here". God, even typing the words feels unnatural haha. \n\nMy boyfriend told me that he loves that I always try to make sure we do things that he will like the most, but he would also love to feel like I take charge whenever we have to make a decision about anything. And not just take charge to help plan something about but wait for his approval at the end, but to be confident and decisive about the end result I want, because "confidence is sexy, and you deserve to feel confident about things." \n\nIt was a great anniversary, but also a great learning experience. And I thought that maybe other people on here could relate to that struggle. 
9	Did I write this?
3	What type is your bf?\n\nI've been with people that prefer several options. I think being decisive definitely something to work on (as in creating *your* perfect date rather than only living in others), but also being aware of the people you're with.\n\nGood luck figuring out what you actually want! :)
6	Friends with Benefits with an ENFJ	**ENFP here**\nI have been dating an ENFJ girl for two months who has swept me off my feet. She is an ambitious, beautiful, confident, smart; your standard ENFJ ;)\n\nBut she isn't sure she wants anything more than hanging out occasionally and sex. She doesn't want anything couply. We're very mature and communicative, and she doesn't want to hurt me.\n\nI'm smitten, but I'm not gaga. If it were possible, I do want to get more serious. *What do you think is going through her head?* Is this toxic? Have you had a positive/poor experience? A good or bad idea considering at some point I want something serious?
11	If she told you she doesn't want anything serious, she surely doesn't want anything serious. It wouldn't make sense for her to lie about it. Plus it doesn't sound like what an ENFJ would do. \n\nYou should tell her about it. Communication is always good. If ever she doesn't want it to get serious, then maybe it would be better to stop the casual sex because it sounds like it would just make it worse (to me, at least, then I guess it depends on individuals). 
11	Yea don't do it.  If you aren't looking for an open relationship, do not expect something serious to arise from an open relationship.  She's being clear with you on this.  What's going through her head is that she's looking for something physical, and not something serious.  \n\nShe's being clear on her intentions and needs.  If you expect more from her then it's really unfair.   It's not toxic how she's expressing what she wants right now.  You're not bad in wanting something serious.\n\nI'm reading it like this:\n\nHer: "I don't want anything serious right now"\nYou: "so if I stick around long enough, you'll eventually want serious".\nHer: "no...."\nfast forward some time later\nYou: "Let's be serious."\nHer: "no"\nYou: "My feels are hurt"\n\nTLDR: This is not toxic, this is her listing out what she wants out of the relationship.  If it does not match your needs, you have to find someone else.  You shouldn't hope for something to happen because it's putting expectations on her when she literally told you what she wanted.\n\nI've personally had experience with someone who wanted to keep it open and it didn't work out because we weren't a match for one another. Just saying.
1	Find out her backstory and her reasons will become clear. We are usually idealistic and love the idea of love.
