7	Out of 16 types, 8 are light and 8 are dark. ESTPs are one of the 8 light types:	
1	>\*Triggered*\n\n\- every dark type
1	You’re right btw. I quite like this. 
1	>public sector  \n>  \n>good\n\nI don't think those go together...\n\n&#x200B;
4	ESTP typing as ENFJ?	Can/willl ESTPs type as ENTJs on these goofy online MTBI assays.   (Not ENFJ as title says)
5	Yes, shares all 4 functions, both extroverts. Really consider the last function to decide. Are you inferior Ti or inferior Ni.
3	I’ve actually thought I was both at different times since I’m a fairly motivating and effective leader, but I think the main difference is that while I realize my goals, I focus on what’s directly in front of me to find the path of least resistance, while an ENXJ will have a solid, objective plan on reaching that goal.
2	More likely the other way around, Estps typing as Entj/Enfj. Could happen if say a younger Estp spends times with older entj/enfj and picks up their mannerisms and such. Wears off quickly though. Entj/enfj don't really type as Estp unless they're unhealthy or something
1	Yes, some ESTP's will type as ENTJ's (is that what you meant?) Shared Se-Ni can make an ENTJ and ESTP look very similar if you don't know them that well, and Ti can look more similar to Te than typing descriptions will tell you.
1	Yes that's what I mean ESTP vs ENTJ
7	Two ESTPS.	Hi ; I recently learned I am an ESTP and it suits me well besides the emotion part I am pretty emotional when I want to be.\n\nI'm like a mix personally. I can be emotional and laid back but I am full of energy around others.\n\nI made my girlfriend take the ESTP test and she is an ESTP as well and we work well together? Is that right? Should this theoretically work? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - My gf is a ESTP and so am I? Is it suppose to work? I thought we where suppose to like Introverts. 
18	why do you care what a dumb ass test says\n\n\nif you guys get along then so be it\n\n\n
5	Just because you are an ESTP does not mean that this defines your life... not even close.\nThere’s so many different kinds of ESTP’s in this world. if you get along then GREAT. \nJust let it be :)
2	Theory:\n\nIt is supposed to be J types with P types + objective types with objective types (and vice versa for the subjective types).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, ESTP's best matches are:\n\nENTJ, ESFJ, ISTJ, INFJ.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's the theory, and it happens to match all my observations. But then who knows, maybe types can be paired with themselves too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn reality:\n\nIf you feel in love, and you feel loved, then it's a good match! Don't question the match. Maybe dig more into your type and hers, and let us curious individuals know what you find! Especially for ESTP, look for those four types I mentioned, it may help you find out.\n\n&#x200B;
2	It's totally okay to be a more feeling ESTP. I relate to you as well. For the most part energetic and down to earth but I can be emotional and relate to feelings when I need to be. The 16 personalities tests (assuming that's the test you took) only focuses on your traits so it won't be 100 percent accurate (still very close!!!) but you also have your functions. And my functions as an ESTP might be different than another ESTP's function. Also its always a good thing to remember there are more than 16 different types of people on earth. We all have our different upbringings which may determine how we think. I wouldn't exclusively look for a certain personality type in a partner. As long as you feel loved and they feel loved then I think that's all that matters. At least that's my best advice. 
1	We don't care what the test says :P\n\nIt's just rather interesting to me personally how personally types are sectored infact. Our sense of humor and ability to cheer each other up and see our body languages is phenomenal we get each other so well. Yet I am very good at persuading even her parents (especially her). I just found it interesting is all. 
6	just wondering how ESTPs would respond to this	[u/throwaway3n1p](https://www.reddit.com/u/throwaway3n1p) and I are currently working on gathering answers for how thought processes work in different MBTI types. This is just out of curiosity, not an attempt to stalk you according to how you think of grave crimes. All replies are appreciated!\n\nIf we count judgments of *moral obligation* out of the equation,\n\nQuestion 1: How is murder logically fine?\n\nQuestion 2: How is murder logically wrong?\n\nNOTE: Feel free to write down whatever thought you have, whether it is emotional or just plain retarded.
7	Murder is fine if the victim has resigned to their rights by committing a crime of the same level (rape, murder, treason, etc.) or when it's a crime of passion.\n\nit's not fine when it's nothing like the above id say\n\n\n\nalso wtf is a moral obligation\n\n\n
4	Answer 1) it is not\n\nAnswer 2) it is
2	Strange question.... you want to leave moral judgment out of the equation, yet ask a moral question?\n\nMurder is never fine. I cannot name a moment when murder is fine. 
2	“the unlawful premeditated killing of one human being by another”\n\n> In the United States, the law regarding murder varies by jurisdiction. In most U.S. jurisdictions there is a hierarchy of acts, known collectively as homicide, of which first degree murder and felony murder are the most serious, followed by second degree murder, followed by voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter which are not as serious, and ending finally in justifiable homicide, which is not a crime at all. \n\n\n> A non-criminal homicide ruling, usually committed in self-defense or in defense of another, exists under United States law. A homicide may be considered justified if it is done to prevent a very serious crime, such as rape, armed robbery, manslaughter or murder. The victim must reasonably believe, under the totality of the circumstances, that the assailant intended to commit a serious crime. A homicide performed out of vengeance, or retribution for action in the past, would not be considered justifiable.\n\n\nSo essentially, logically it’s justifiable and legal if it’s in self defense.\n\nLogically if it’s not in self defense then, it’s illegal and unlawful.\n\nMorality, is a whole separate topic that doesn’t belong with logic and doesn’t align with being an estp 
2	NAP. Non-Aggression Principle.
1	> If we count judgments of moral obligation out of the equation,\n\nThis is impossible to answer. Without reference to a set of moral obligation (ie. the framework by which right and wrong is defined) these questions make no real sense. \n\nLogic does not decide right and wrong, given a set of information logic can only decide between three options: (1) it follows, (2) it does not follow, or (3) there is not enough information to decide.\n\nlets drop that sentence...\n\n> Question 1: How is murder ~~logically~~ fine?\n\n> Question 2: How is murder ~~logically~~ wrong?\n\nMurder is **morally** fine, in my opinion, only when one believes there is no other option in the set of all possible actions and inactions. To decide this is the burden of the individual.
1	1. Murder would be logically 'fine' if for example how I would feel about the massacres that occurred during the Crusades to which I would say it's fine whatever.\n2. Murder would be logically 'wrong' if for example I was asked to murder an innocent civilian to which I would say no since it would be wrong.
1	murder is logically fine when its efforts aid you or your tribe's survival or your own reproduction by fighting off another competitor.\n\nexample: youre a caveman and some fuckface comes strolling through your village trying to take some of your stuff. kill him to help you better survive by keeping your resources.  Or you see a pretty tribal girl in the forest and so does your enemy. you both fight and you kill him in order to ensure you mate with the tribal girl. In both cases, you don't necessarily have to kill him but it could be reasonably sound so they don't remain a threat.\n\nIt's logically wrong when it serves no purpose to better your survival or reproductive purposes, or that of the tribes.  Innocent killing - a random bystander, a child with no defense, a woman you kill because of a sudden rage, the mother of your child, etc.. Killing someone with no inherent reason is logically wrong as it serves no evolutionary purpose.\n\nedit: I've switched between ESTP, isfp, istp.. not sure how but wassup
4	Survey on personality and Flirting behaviors	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
13	Anyone else wish they didn't know? Or think it's bs?	I took the MB test today and this time I'm ESTP. I am definitely a doer. No question that I do a lot of stuff. I'm outgoing, problem solving, a project person- not a long term job person. There's some stuff that's me. But not loving theoretical discussions? Or being poorly suited to higher ed?  I'm on my 15th year of full time college education, on scholarships all the way and will be called Doctor very soon. I hate that there is someone deciding I'm anonymously not good at this (I see now that my hatred for that is very ESTP).  And we're not good at long term relationships because we crave excitement?  I've been with my husband for 20 years and could not *imagine* wanting anything else.  Is this bullshit? I hate that I took this test. 
12	yeah lots of ESTP stuff is bullshit cause people dont really understand how we can be such powerhouses at pretty much everything. its them rolling out the old trope where you cant be cool and smart at the same time. just ignore it.
3	Well, the test result apply more to the younger people, you get more well rounded with age.\n\nThere's also an N-bias of sort, since we are the majority online. See how this sub isn't very frequented ? Now, compare it r/INTP. in terms of subscribers.\n\nAnother thing is the shallowness of the descriptions. ESTP aren't against theoretical discussion, they just like solid, observable, verifiable facts more. The theory behind is is based on the 8 cognitive functions (www.cognitiveprocesses.com) So, facts and observation would be your Se. And if they say you dislike the theorical, it's because of your low Ni. Some types that appreciate it like INFJs or INTJs could consider you shallow, since you read between the lines too much, or you don't project yourself in the future too much. What they miss, however, is that you don:'t precisely because you saw the chaos out here, the possible stuff, all the variable to consider, so you don't like summarizing it abstractly ? (Most descriptions also ignores your Ne, which is considering multiples possibilities)\n\nAnyway, it kinda makes sense when you dig it out a bit, and the bias isn't going to get fixed if you never give your perspective. \n
2	Hm, why would it say not liking theoretical discussions? The T is right there.  \n\nBut anyway, the descriptions either come from studies involving a lot of people or straight out of someone's ass, depending on where you took the test. Inaccuracies happen. You don't even have to accept the label if you don't want to. No one will link you to those traits if you don't tell them about it ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
2	Most of  the stereotype is Te and Fe ideas being circle jerked. 
2	Theoretical discussions are fact based, not feelings based. Talking about feelings is “useless” to solve s problem. That’s how you should consider it.\n\nExcitement is also very subjective. It could mean you’re craving the wildest sex with everyone and nobody, or that you like to do sonething spontaneous with your husband. Maybe try that restaurant you’ve always wanted or go on a holiday to a place people may not say right away.\n\nThe test is basically so you have an idea what you are. But that’s not the only thing that shapes you. There’s so much more. But it’s especially good to know if you want to know what stresses you out, or what causes you to move etc.
2	There are a lot of younger folks that take this test and it shows. I'm also in a long term relationship and have 3 degrees. As an older estp,  some things I read are so cringworthy. It's probably cuz I'm female and most of the descriptions of estps are male-focused. Then I realize the person writing it probably isn't an estp and try to brush it off. It baffles me how we can be labeled as go-getters and complete failures at the same time.\n\nAs I've gotten older, I've found it harder to find people who are excited for life (i.e fun) and have stability. Most of my friends from college have not progressed as much as I have and I'm not about to hang with fuddy duddys. What a life.
11	ESTP college student rant	Sorry guys, I really need to vent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just visited my transfer university and damn, haha! Is it **boring**...\n\nSo is this it, is this the college experience ™  that I pay 35k a year for? Just study, walk hecka, go to class, walk back, dorm, repeat?  Man, I’m not about that fucking life, **fuck that** for real I don’t want to spend 2 years of my life being a lonely, broke ass nerd in a diploma mill / adult daycare. \n\nI want to work, make money, do something big, travel to places, camp outside, make deals, build things, shake hands with important people, just do **REAL** things. All these classes are PREVENTING me from doing it all and they're stressing me out. I'm really fucking tired of all this complacency of the people around me. All I'm seeing is just a bunch of fucking nerds that don't share the same soul or pure anger I have with how everyone is just FORCED to be OKAY with all of this shit. I honestly don't give a fuck about you knowing the cross vector product of some random ass particle, like who gives a shit dude. What a fucking waste of time that you have to spend, knowing all those useless things, when the job is *COMPLETELY DIFFERENT!!!* than the education you pay for. \n\nDamn just hire me already am I right? Hahahaha. There's a reason why on the JOB TRAINING exists. I'll tell you straight up, I'm not a fucking dumbass, I can easily learn the ropes of any job and I don't need to go in debt and waste years of my life and hard earned cash for learning useless, unnecessary shit. Like I'll definitely learn what I NEED to know. Don't force feed me things that I don't need on the job dude. Just stop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm really about to lose it. It's getting to the point where I want to experience "**REAL"** things to replace this emptiness I have inside being forced into all this bullshit. I'm getting the urge to drink and smoke again, and I know that's not good. I tried exercising, hanging out, playing games, but it all just seems like a temporary distraction and it just makes me more angry. The only reason why I'm still in college is because my parents are paying for it, but I'm an adult now and I can do what I want. \n\nI don't want to be forced to do things I don't want to do, and that I know that I don't absolutely need to do. That's not living dude. I just want to enjoy my life. Fuck this.
9	Yeah school sucks but college is like an extrovert's wet dream. Everyone is so down to hangout... so many activities and events going on. 
4	School is an ends to a mean. The people were cool and my major classes were fun, so that helped. But the 'fun' didn't start til junior year when the Gen Ed's were out of the way. Your parents are paying for it so please don't  throw this opportunity  away. \n\nI find estps to be lifelong learners. so find a major/something that's always changing so you can't get bored.
2	Im only in school for the paper and credits. That crap is required for a lot of jobs. If it weren't for that, I doubt Id bother with any kind of schooling outside of trade or specialization(its a lot more practical).\n\nAlso, prerequisite classes friggin suck. Why do I need to take Humanities as a Fire Science Technology major? It serves no purpose. As if I didn't hate school enough, now Ive gotta waste my time with useless courses. \n\n
1	That's why I dropped out.\n\nfuck that shit. you don't need a paper to make money
1	Get a side hustle, start a business, take advantage of the resources and connections your university can offer you 
1	I feel you man
9	How do I tell my ESTP boyfriend I’m not ready to move in with him?	Me: ENTJ (25f) Him: ESTP (28m)\n\nThings happened very fast, and we both want to move away from the area.\n\nI think if we move, he implied it would make sense to move in together, and his logic is that we already practically live together.\n\nI am unsure because he typically does things very fast and often times it can be hard to be part of it or watch it etc.\n\nI really do care about him and I NEVER want to hold him back from an experience but I’m not ready and I’m worried if I explain he will only understand “she doesn’t want to be with me.”\n\nThanks for any advice, FYI his idea if it matters.\n\nThanks 
11	ESTP, out of all types, should be able to understand not being ready for that kind of commitment. Just make it clear that you still want to be with him.
5	By telling him you’re not ready to move in with him 
2	One of my best friends from high school is also a 28m ESTP. He’s been half-pressuring me to move in with him since forever, I think in part because he knows I’m more responsible than he is and have more money than he does. That, and titties. \n\nI don’t judge him for wanting to be somewhat carried in life, I’m just not going to be the one to do it. As much as he thinks he wants someone to put their foot down and see through his BS, I don’t actually see any evidence he genuinely wants that. He prefers the safety of having the mental/emotional upper hand in relationships. I hope your bf is a healthier ESTP than my bff is. \n\nESTPs are resilient. Just tell him the truth in a way that isn’t crushing. If he is mature, he’ll accept it and try again later. If not, well then you have bigger problems to worry about in this relationship. 
2	If he’s a healthy ESTP it won’t be a problem. Opening up the conversation on how you still want to move, and thinking logistically how you could both make it work financially would be helpful.\n\nAs an ESTP maintaining some of my individuality and personal space doesn’t seem like that much to ask- just don’t make it about him. \n\nJust have to be honest, direct and open about why you feel the way you do- and that it’s not something you’re quite ready for in this stage of life for whatever reason (you don’t necessarily even need to have one)\nI feel like he should be able to understand/appreciate you living true to you and not take it personally 
2	ESTP-ENTJ is a great pairing! :D Kudos! 
2	Just tell him ur nervous of all that change at once (moving to a new city And moving in together).  Say you wanna do one thing at a time....move to the city first and then see what happens. \n\nThat assumes that maybe u would want to live with him at some point in the future. If thats not the case, dont make him believe he has a chance in the future. Just say you prefer to live alone. 
1	Just go for it
1	Be blunt and honest. You're probably taking this harder than he will.
4	estps you guys just amaze me!	estps you guys just amaze me!, im talking about the unhealthy ones that is lol\n\n\nunhealthy estps are sooo hardcore, fearless and doers!, most crimanals are istps and estps by statistics. and when i was visiting the hospital one time, i saw this estp women, walking, with 9 policement behind her, she was in chains, but the way she walked just amazed me! the fearlessness\n\n\ni know alexander the great was an estp and he also had that charisma, that confidence and being a doer without fear!\n\n\nopinions?
16	I can’t read this, Jesus 
5	Delete this please, for your own sake 
2	Gee...  Thanks?? o_O
2	Thanks, now go fuck yourself
2	It's messed up that you single the unhealthy ones, so many great athletes are estp. It's also messed up that you say "most criminals," where are your sources? 
2	Lol thanks I guess. Were the companion cavalry!
1	Healthy ones are generally confident too. Give 'em some luuuuve. \nYou admiring criminals worries me a bit to be honest.
6	Jet's MBTI - Cast Podcast	Hey Reddit, my name is jetplane48 (ESTP 7w8 sx/sp) and I am starting up a podcast in relation to MBTI. Fundamentally, the goal of the podcast is to educate the viewers of several Typology systems through a series of one-on-one's with others who are interested in the same topics. I have been conducting interviews for many years (MBTI related) and this is just an extension of that, however, I want to discuss topics that the audience wants me to cover. Naturally, I'll come up with my own material but I would love to explore topics that others have in mind. I am busy with school for the next few months but when I finish, the goal is to eventually be more consistent with these podcast uploads if this turns out to be popular enough. I'm very excited to get this started, and let's see some questions!\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg)
6	any advice from other ESTP’s?	
8	Embrace your personality.\n\nActions speak louder than words
4	Ahhhh yep, welcome to the struggle. Biggest thing I've done successfully to improve this has been really working hard on my listening skills, also on responding with things like "that sounds awful" instead of "well you could fix that by doing x". That's the best I've got. It is definitely very hard and I completely feel you on caring a ton about people and then getting feedback that they don't realize you care about them because somehow it all got lost in translation. 
2	Commented on the other topic. I could copy and paste... but all I can  add here for now is is that I’ve been called a insensitive and a dick as well. xD
1	I am an INFP and my ex was ESTP. There were sooo many conversations where i felt like i was never actually being heard, he was a pretty unhealthy ESTP tbh. He would constantly interrupt me and would dominate the conversation. It had started getting so difficult for me, it took me a while to realise why i think he doesnt care. So when i started confronting him, he would usually get defensive but also tried to put an effort to listen more after a while. But it didnt really come naturally to him. And it makes more sense now because he would always say he cares for me and he loves me but his actions never really showed that. I also think he was narcissistic. There were days where he would make me feel good and then there were days where i felt so not valued. \n\nI think being aware of another person’s feelings is a good start. And yeah just definitely try and listen. Maybe if you practice enough, it will start coming naturally? 
0	I’ve been told I’m actually an ESTP.	I’m now locking myself up and throwing away the key....
3	I think you're more of an ENTP because you care to instigate back. Looking back at the average comment history posts in this subreddit, this post struck me as odd because it falls way outside that parameter. Just embrace who you are.
2	Bro, you are entp af. The girl who typed you is some kind of passive aggressive Fi dom. Can smell that shit a mile away.
2	Yeah, ENTP all the way. I've never seen an ESTP who likes to be as random as you
1	What type did you think you were before?
11	Are you less mature than your peers?	Do you ever find that you are intellectually far ahead of your peers but emotionally you are very reactive and underdeveloped?   Ti aux and Fe Tertiary maybe?
13	Outwardly, yeah. Inwardly, I can’t make that assumption since I logically wouldn’t be able to tell, but I feel well-rounded for my age.
8	I think my maturity to handle situations far outranks most people my age, but I am a goof. I get called silly a lot in my day to day, yet I don't think that makes me any less mature. 
4	Depends on which social circle I'm with. Some friends think I'm mature and others know I'm not. 
4	Yes.
3	My peers don't think so, but my family does. 
3	I agree for the emotional maturity. Not sure if it's because of ESTP or other experiences.
2	More mature, but oftentimes people mistake having fun for immaturity. 
1	I'm on the older side of life, so not any more, but definitely for a while in some ways. In other ways I was ahead. For me it is because of an abusive childhood. Is that a common childhood for ESTPs?
11	Does working out give you guys energy while sitting idle makes you dull and tired ?	Noticed Ni doms get energy by sitting at home and doing minimal tasks while Se doms tend to get energy by doing a lot of stuff like working out and cycling ? 
6	Yes I get a huge buzz from weightlifting. And then I get to school and have to sit in a desk for 8 hours
5	no\n\nIt sounds cheesy but I get insane energy as soon as the sun sets \n
5	I'm more of a cycling person than lifting, but yeah, about 20 mins in I can start to feel the buzz and I'm always in a better mood once I'm done.
3	It’s a gamble, honestly. It usually gives me energy for the time I’m working out when I’m tired. I recently stayed up for 31 hours straight and decided to go for a workout to get my energy up, but it completely drained me, and walking home was difficult because it felt like my soul was leaving my body.
1	Sort of.  If I don't work out, I've got energy to burn at the end of the day and have a less satisfying sleep.  And yes, I can't just sit and watch tv.  I have to be doing something unless it's a rare show or movie holding me rapt.  Otherwise, I'm drawing, painting, playing my bass, messing around on here, looking for memes on insta, lol.  Sometimes I'll even do laundry.\n\nPoint being, I can't just sit still unless that's the point of an activity, like yoga, meditation, and prayer, and certainly not idle.  It drives my infj husband a little crazy sometimes.
4	How to give you some bad news	I have to tell an ESTP some likely bad news. I am worried he will not take it well because he is kind of a ranty person and finds it hard to let things go.  How can I break this to you in the best way? Text? FaceTime? \n\nEdit: in person not possible bc of long distance. Can’t do it in person bc long distance. Options are to say something “like we need to talk” over text and ask to FaceTime or ask to FaceTime and just say it straight out or to text all the details out immediately.
11	It’s always best if it’s in person. Easy to process everything that way. \n\nAnd be very direct and clear about whatever it is. 
9	be straight as fuck, its the only way to get the message across  \n\n\n&#x200B;
1	Just be straightforward and honest 
1	“Hey you need to get yourself checked.” \nPretty easy really.
1	Express the bad news the same way to him you think he would react to the news itself.\n\nThat could work.
8	Problems with writing papers in school.	Did anyone else have a tough time writing papers in highschool? I can articulate myself perfectly when just talking, but as soon as it comes to writing a structured paper I get insane writer's block. 
4	I either barely passed or failed english classes cause of having to do papers or book reports
3	Same problem here, the Teachers comment is always like “great points but too anecdotal. Tone is way too informal” well my essay score still turns out better than half the class. I think maybe the teacher was bored of reading normal essays anyways 
2	Write in your speaking voice then leave the (heavy) editing for later.\n\nI could never plan out that I wanted to write in outlines, so I just free-thought it, jotting down ideas of what I wanted to write during the writing process. I'm more likely to use different color font to organize my writing (then switch it back to black before submitting it) than an actual outline. \n\nI did this though grad school and graduated. I even had a few teachers comment how easy the paper was to read because she could 'hear my voice' behind the words. 
1	Structure is always a problem, especially for ESTP. What works for me is to plan it beforehand. It feels real stupid to do, and usually I just do whatever and it looks good. But especially when structure is vital I basically make a draft first, where structure can lack and have a plan (Introduction - First part - Second part etc) next to it. After that I sort of pick and choose.
1	I'm a research scientist and I write papers all day every day. I rock this. I don't believe that personality limits anyone. You can do it. You probably were not taught well.  I started writing research papers in middle school, so by high school I was confident (yea for public ed!). If you learn how to organize your information, thoroughly research and know what you want to write, then stick to the intro paragraph, three main points (or whatever the assignment calls for), and conclusion, you're golden. Also, here are the steps: 1. Understand what is being asked of you. 2. do research 3. Write your main idea, 4. Write an outline 5. Write first and last paragraphs, 6, write main ideas for each paragraph (insert them into the outline) then write your paper and conclusion. 
6	Created a subreddit for SPS	I think there about 20-30 of us SPs who regularly comment on mbti related subs, so I created a new sub for us.  \n\nPlease subscribe to  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheArtisans/ \n
6	why
1	Good luck
8	estps how do you finding dating?	estps how do you find dating?\n\n\nhow do you guys find picking up women,and women men?\n\nor same sex pickups?
14	Pretty easy.  Use a bunch of dating apps. Line up a bunch of dates. Go on them. Find someone that clicks, make a move, get into a relationship.
10	I find it to be boring, I've done the pump and dump kind of dates and after a while it got dull for me.\n\nI prefer long term relationships and I usually do dates around noon so we have plenty of time to drink and talk
4	Go do stuff, join a class, play a sport, anything that's an activity in a group. Meet people, make friends, see if you're interested in anyone you meet, ask them out. Keep asking them out if it's going well.
2	Dm other local highschoolers that have a friend or two in common
3	Im a ISTP and was wondering if theres a huge difference in Se with ISTPs and ESTPs	I know that obviously ESTPs have stronger Se than ISTPs, but since thats a ISTPs first perception function would ISTPs see the world as vivid and be as in the moment as ESTPs? Or would it be toned down and kinda foggy if thats the right word like how a INTJ or ENTJs Se would be? 
9	ESTPs have a lot more sex we're rubbish at flirting that's probably the biggest difference
3	ISTPs are the inferior versions of ESTPs
2	Suddenly I became ESTP from ISTP this year.\n\nThis is so fucking good.
2	ISTPs and ESTPs have pretty similar views of the world. Biggest difference is that ISTPs are somewhat more independent, while ESTPs will do anything to share their spontaneity.
7	Sense of Purpose?	For all older ESTP's, (I'm 18 male) have you guys felt like you've found your purpose? What gets you up in the morning. What's your daily Motivator? Is it super stimulating? or more soothing.
14	Yeah\n\nMy main purpose is just to have fun, do things I want to do, feel balanced with myself, and share my experiences with others. I realize that once you pay off the house and car, the rest of life is really up to you. You can get married if you want, make a business, travel, work out, or all of this with a balanced work schedule up to retirement. \n\nWhat gets me up in the morning is that there are so many things to do that I'm possibly missing out on. I don't want to die knowing I missed out skiing or experiencing Jamaica or some shit. It's not only physically going places but mentally. I like to see how I can solve the world's problems and try to help humanity as a whole. I want to leave a legacy somehow, but if I don't, that's okay. As long as I'm satisfied with my life and no one forced me to do anything, I don't care if I die.\n\nI'd say it's soothing and stimulating at the same time. Actually, I get soothed as I get stimulated because I'm finally doing something I enjoy and I'm not missing out. Like I'm actually doing something I want to do and that makes me happy.\n\nEdit: I just wanna get this out there but I know some people make their whole lives serving a God or trying to get to heaven. I used to be like that and I’m not saying that’s bad I’m just saying that the mindset it forced me in secluded me from a lot of experiences until I had to think outside the box and explore. I’ve seen religious people discriminate innocent people’s life choices, fight each other, and so forth. Bro, stop doing this please. Don’t shove your personal life choice to other people and threaten them with eternal hellfire. If God was really fair he wouldn’t do such a thing even for people with their own conscious choose to reject him. Also atheists are guilty of this too. Life is not about materialistic stuff, it’s about being happy and striving for something to be honest that’s all I’m gonna say here peace
6	Yo......you're 18.  I know us ESTP's seem to juggle 20 plates at once on life.  On one hand we're like wtf am I going to do with my life.  On the other we're like no worries I'll figure it out.  All the while not wanting to miss out on opportunities.  My advice as a 43 year old ESTP.  Don't sweat it.  Really there are few things in your life you can control.  Those few are you and your character and motivations.  All the rest are small details.  At 18 you may be saying wtf are you talking about?????\n\nWhat I'm saying is that in life very few things are going to keep you down long.  No matter what you go through.  A break up.  A loss of a job.  Hard times financially.  You won't be down for long before you're back up on your feet.  So my advice is to ride the waves and not stress out about everything.  Why?  Because like the stock market as long as you are progressing it's always going to be going up.  \n\nAll the best my friend.  You WILL figure this out.
2	This gave a ton of insight really needed to hear this. Thanks.  It reassures what I’ve always known to be true about myself; regardless of what the parents/peers say. 
2	knowing that no one but you cares about your own success

8	Se and Suffering	Do Se doms experience higher degrees of physical pain or suffering compared to other types? Either by lifestyle or pain sensitivity
15	Estps experience more physical pain because we(stereotypically) do stupid stunts and skydive without parachutes.
6	I find I have an unnaturally high pain tolerance but that's probably just me and not an ESTP thing.\n\nedit: i can't speak english lmao
1	Well ESTPs have Si as an ignored function. So while they should easily connect to their bodily sensations, it's usually subconsciously ignored for the sake Se or external stimuli. That said ESTPs are often very active and will be very brutal with their body without realizing it.\n\nBe careful because you might pay for it when you're older.

9	What types of conversation excite you most?	My dad is an ESTP.\n\nI go to the bar with him after work on Fridays, sometimes with co-workers, other times just the two of us.\n\nIf it's just us, there tends to be quite a few moments where I have no clue what the fuck to talk about.\n\n\~\n\nHis go-to topic is work, and we do talk about it quite a bit, but sometimes it feels more like a crutch than genuine bonding conversation.\n\nAlso, I try to ask questions, but they don't seem to engage much, like I'm not pushing the right buttons.\n\nSoooo I just want a better idea of what *types* of conversations are most fulfilling for ESTP, maybe from there I can gather some new topics to bring up, or some new approaches towards our chats.
10	talk about urself 
8	I like hearing about how someone's day or week went. Was anything out of the ordinary? 
3	I like talking about some unconventional stuff. I like arguing with people. Not like fighting. More like convince the other one about my opinion. I'm not sure, if it's good strategy for your father, but that's up to you. 
13	It’s good to find stuff I can recognise	I think this will be a long story... but it’s mostly a rant. Throwaway account. The beginning is introductory. I’m sure I can make my story shorter, but still.\n\nI’m 28, and about 7 months I had to do a mandatory professional personality test for work. They wanted to see what my strengths and weaknesses for the company were. At the time I was sliding towards a bore-out(burn out symptoms, but that’s because I was bored and stressed). I was working from home and moved to a completely different city on the other side of the country with no real close friends here.\n\nI learned I had an ESTP personality. Before this I considered those tests bullshit. Funny internet gimmicks to get my money. But with the professional we went more into: “What work would suit you? What gives you energy” and I started to recognise more and more.\n\nAll those talks were work-related, but I started to recognise more and more traits in my personal life. I am social, open, enthusiastic and.. let’s call it intense. I can imagine I am the type certain introverts find draining. However, everything developed into a complete bore-out, lost my job because of it... and now I find myself wanting to say yes to all my impulses.\n\nThere are certain problems I do find with my personality. Sexually I am basically up for anything, as long as I am not the sub. However, that part also got me in trouble a couple of times. I need to experience it all. Met a cute girl on the other side of the world... LDR wouldn’t work out, but I still wanted to visit her to stay in her bed and leave... It’s so stupid, but I am -that- impulsive and have this hang for adventure.\n\nI need people around me, but mostly people I can do real stupid shit with. I regret it every morning, but I have trouble saying no. I should learn how to, but every time I say: “That’s a problem for tomorrow”.\n\nI feel I have no good way of releasing all my energy... so I turn to love, lust and booze. The whole selfdestructive shenanigans. How do you all channel the whole extraverted need for adventure?(I was told this fits the personality).\n\nTL;DR: I recently got sick of stress and boredom and now find myself needing more adventure than I know is good for me.
6	I think we, too, are all drowning in love, lust, and booze.

15	Confused whether to make more friends or not	IDK if it's just me, but do you guys relate? \n\nIt seems like I'm on the edge whether I want to make more friends or not. At some point, I would love to have more friends because I enjoy having more company and knowing more people. But at the same time, I don't want to have more friends because I'd have too much attachments to keep track of.\n\nLike I get a bunch of messages from friends I have sometimes, but I can't type / message back all the time and I don't want to appear rude that I don't want to talk to them and stuff. I don't know, I mean I know I can just leave them and say I'm busy but to me that just feels cold, even colder if I just leave them in the dust, so I feel obligated to message them back and the cycle continues you know. Sometimes I just appear friendly to people that they naturally just want to talk to me and be friends/hang out but sometimes I just want to be alone. IDK\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you guys relate and how do you figure it out? Thanks guys\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
7	I like making more friends but I just tell them I don't like texting.If I wanted to talk to them I initiate it
3	I can completely relate. There’s a certain charm to meeting someone, talk for a long time and after that no more obligations. I want to make lots of friends but it’s hard to... stay in touch.\n\nMy tip is to not be the initiator in “Want my cell?” Or anything. Just enjoy yourself. And when they do basically say: “I’m not much of a texter” or something. Lay the groundrules for new friends, you know. “Coffee/drink, I am yours... but I know I am no star in texting”
2	i can somewhat relate. i can appear friendly, i can also just put on my resting bitch face (& it’ll be easier). but i don’t feel socially accepted when i put on my RBF :/ & i keep wanting to get more friends. when i get more friends, i have fun in the beginning but i get sick of them soon after & reply only after 4-5 days. kind of ruined my rep.\n\ni suggest telling them directly that u have that habit of not wanting to text back all the time or sometimes want to be alone. that should fix the problem. communication is key. set things right at the start so that there won’t be any miscommunication. \n\nif u choose to avoid the problem (like i did previously), it will make them feel even worse about u (i’m sure ur Fe child won’t like that). it’s better to out right state it & risk looking like an idiot than hurt their feelings while also over complicating things\n\n
2	My Dad is a ESTP and he would make tons of friends.  But of course in his day, there was no texting(and not much phoning).  So he would be glad to see and talk to these friends when he would randomly meet them in public.  No problem in that day and age.\n\nMust be a way for the ESTP to function in modern society.  
2	About the feeling of being obligated to text back, I do completely relate and receiving their texts do sting for those who I don’t really want to. \n\nAbout figuring out whether to make more friends or not, nowadays I try (however selfish it may seem) to stick to the rule of whether I can see the potential of somehow gaining/benefiting by being their acquaintance. Although I often end up just making friends with them regardless, and the shitty loop goes on and on. 
1	Yes! I really have this but i don’t see this as a problem. I just don’t build a deep connection with new people anymore because i already have a bunch of good friends and i don’t have time for more. It’s sounds really practical but it’s the truth. Sometimes a make new friends if the are really special and i really enjoy their company. But also there a some really good friends that i lost. I also categorize them. A lot of just normal friends which i see a lot in school/soccer but not really good friends. It could be good friends if i hangout out with them but i don’t do this because of my time for my other friends.
1	If I weren't sure whether or not to get new friends, then I probably wouldn't. It's hard for me to make real new friends if I'm confused or stressed about my social/emotional state. If you really can make new friends with that confusion, then great, the more the merrier, but it would be hard for me to connect if I felt like I was neglecting other friends.
10	ESTP and ENTJ friendship!	i have an ESTP friend, and i had a blast hanging out with him today? the way he just blends with the enviroment and is confident in interacting with it is so fun and refreshing!\n\nhis reflexes and enviroment awareness were really impressive too!!!\n\ni think a difference between us is that, im better at interacting with people if theres a goal (e.g getting into a club, ordering something etc), while hes way better if its just for the sake of socializing\n\nso i want to know what ESTPs generally like and about ENTJs, and what they generally dislike, so ill have a better picture of our relationship!\n\n
9	Not about a goal, ENTJ just wants ego and money. ESTP gets it as a byproduct. \n\nMany of my best friends and people that have annoyed me with their stupid frigid rules are ENTJ. We have fun and they clean up gladly, they just care too much about how others view them.\n\nGood and bad. \nOne of them the Muslim boy who deflowered me and wouldn't marry me because I was no longer a virgin. Fuck him. He knew it was all bullshit but his desire to please and follow stupid rules is too much. Coward. 
10	Any ESTP guys on here, are you guys generally attracted to ENFP girls?	I often hear about INxJ/ENFP or xSxx/ESTP pairings, but frankly, stories with ESTP/ENFP are rare.\n\nIn the ENFP community, most are attracted to fellow intuitives especially INTJ to the point that it's become a comical stereotype that I simply cannot relate to and don't care for.\n\nMy closest ENFP friends and I have realized that most of the men in our lives that we're often attracted to and attract are xSTPs.\n\nHow would you guys rate ENFPs compared to other types that you're attracted to? And if you're repulsed by us, feel free to share and why as well. :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\*Edit: Lol at the downvotes. I can already guess who got butthurt and it's probably neither ENFPs nor ESTPs. 
13	Well I’m an ESTP and am currently seeing an enfp...so pretty attracted I suppose
5	Almost all the people I’ve dated are ENFP/INFP and I’ve been dating an ENFP for 2.5 years now. I guess I’m also seeing a pattern ahahaha.
7	to be completely honest I can find myself attracted to anyone personality wise who isn't a J, and even then I can make a lot of exceptions. As long as you're not going to make me your therapist and you're okay with spontaneous, last minute adventures (even to the corner store) and are okay with not planning everything I'll probably at least consider ya. I'm an ESTP bi dude so I think I fill your preferred criteria pretty well, hahah.
4	I would rate ENFPs middle of the pack to upper level relationship status depending on various factors like shared values, intelligence etc. I seem to attract ENFPs like a moth to a flame or some metaphor especially in socioeducational settings like College as well as parties etc. If you're either one you'd ideally want to show genuine interest early and often if you want to pursue a real relationship and generally talk a lot about how you guys feel about a lot of stuff which the ENFPs love but really drain the ESTP. ESTP like being in control and many times the ENFP likes to wrestle that control away and ESTPs don't really like to manipulate so we let yall do your thing but eventually we need it back. Many times there are increasing levels of selfishness in this regard from either sides so that should be noted and addressed before it can cause real damage to trust levels that can then only be repaired after a period of time (can be years). ESTPs love being analytical not unlike intps not that we don't make logical mistakes but many times those mistakes are due to external factors. Also love playfully stroking our egos hehe. Enfps are straight airheads most of the time so we really have to make sure that balloon stays full of air for the benefit of both parties. Also it's a big plus if you guys can connect on some deeper spiritual or philanthropic level. ESTPs are generally really popular everywhere and care somewhat about their social status so just try not to embarrass them, that can cause them to become resentful or pissed off. We are also constantly trying to improve/elevate thanks to aux ti so you may soon realize that you can become woefully unprepared to handle the awesomeness that we can/will become. Just sayin
2	In Socionics, these two types share an ego relation (described here: http://www.socionics.com/rel/ego.htm) . The functions between them are reversed and inverse - which ultimately makes teamwork hard. And if you're aiming for a serious long-term partnership, teamwork is what you need. This kind of relation is like the equivalent of asking about an INFJ and ISTJ being good partners and why you rarely hear of it. The values are just... different.\n\nAnecdotally, speaking as a dual-partner to ESTPs, their willpower and "alpha"-ness is very strong (extroverted sensing) and wants admiration (tertiary Fe). I haven't really met any ENFPs that respect that Se in the way I see an ESTP needing it. But, again, I'm no ESTP I'm just experienced with 'em
2	My last two boyfriends have been ENFP and I've never had a better time to be honest. We just get each other on so many levels. Finally found the ones that not just get me or tolerate me but accept me and we can just live. Learning how to love them and let them be free, was never used to someone equally free as me. Will report as my latest relationship develops. 
2	Well it’s just casual so far she’s leaving for a six month internship in about a month. I can see where we might clash for example she’s not near the risktaker/thrillseeker I am but in general we communicate pretty well. I’m not really an expert on all the functions and what not so if you want an in depth breakdown from that sort of perspective I’m the wrong guy but I’d be happy to answer any question you have if I can
2	ENFPs are my favorite type

11	Do you deal with loneliness often? How do you get through it?	
13	This a problem for me. I need A LOT of social interaction. \n\nIf I'm home alone for more than 2 nights in a week I start feeling lonely and depressed. I make sure to spend a lot of time with my friends or boyfriend (but we just broke up this morning). \n\nUsually when I'm single I line up dates for almost every night. For the first time in a while I feel like I want to just take some time to reflect and focus on self improvement and my hobbies/art.
7	I’m extremely independent and also very satisfied with the way I am, so I refuse to change even slightly to satisfy anyone else. I live for myself and myself only. Because of that, I end up losing a lot of friendships and romantic relationships. It’s a pretty lonely way to live, and it can be rough, but at the end of the day I’d rather be myself and be alone than fake my personality and change for others, because the reality is that I’m the only person who is 100% guaranteed to be in my life. I don’t think you can ever fully rely on anyone to stick around and be there for you, so what sense does it make to change who you are to please others? I think as long as you are pleased with who you are and can look in the mirror at the end of the day and be satisfied, that’s all that really matters. You will always have yourself, so be somebody that you can love. 
6	I had this irrational fear of being alone and failing in life , these two used to be my nightmare and I would do anything to avoid it but I had repressed it so much that I had to embrace it at one point in my life and first become comfortable with the idea of  being a failure and being alone. Now I’m comfortable with both,  it’s weird but it isn’t that bad it’s actually very  balanced than  what I was before ,introspection and self awareness are good tools to have for someone like us whose life can be quite fast to even notice what’s happening within us. But too much alone time is detrimental too  as I can dig myself in some deep rabbit hole.  \n\nIt was thrilling to face both these fears and embrace them  actually loved going towards something that was threatening  me and to finally make peace with it. 
5	I love being alone. \n\n\nMy true personality comes out when I have money and am at a party where I can be as loud as I can (my place).\n\nIf I could I would live alone the rest of my life but I've come to realize that I need to interact with people in order to maintain my mental health at a optimal level.\n\nOnly women that I'm in a relationship with I can tolerate the most.\n\n\nI realize that I'm lonely when I start to dream that I'm either hanging out with friends or with a love interest. Usually legal and illegal drugs fix that for a moment
5	If I'm being forced to stay inside, alone, for more than 2 days I start getting anxious.\n\nHow I get through it is by going outside (walking, jogging). It is possible for me to replace social interaction with online, but I start getting more frustrated because I prefer meeting people in real life and interacting with them face-to-face and going places.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the off-chance I can't go outside for more than 2 days, I go on the internet and try to be productive with a project or something to keep me occupied. I usually blast loud/exciting music (eurobeat, rock) to help my mind wander and let me relax. Sometimes I even read self-improvement novels, or start reading about philosophy or other questions I have in my mind on what to do. Eventually at some point I'll figure out a solution to my loneliness, and that is usually finding a way to get outside (if in the case I'm ever restricted to, which is terrible).
2	Meditation. Yoga. Prayer. Etc. Realize that we desperately need these because of our inferior Ni. Otherwise we will be stressed, jittery, anxious, and not our true honest natural selves. Also sooner is better than later.
2	As an ESFP I used to be socially needy as a teenager, but now I enjoy my alone time a lot more and don't worry about always getting someone to go out with
7	ESTP Veterans: What did you do career-wise after military service?	My husband's an ESTP and wants to get out of the Army (Infantry) after 7 years in. What led you to get out and what are you doing now? How was the transition from military life to civilian life for you? \n\nHe's seen combat and has had 3 deployments. \n\nHe's interested in sustainable living/tiny homes/earth ships/survival skills/weapons.
5	I work for a company called Colors On Parade , we do automotive paint repair , both the work and customer relations are a great fit for artisans especially ESTP \nThey also have a great program for veterans.\ncolorsonparade.com
15	Sex	Does anyone else really not have a specific fetish as much as theyre open to trying anything your partner suggests?
8	Open but not to all things. I draw the line on being a sub. I'll try almost anything once but there is no desire whatsoever in subbing. 
6	Yes! I am a fiend to please, especially when my sexual partner says something in particular gets them more excited. For example, one will only have sex if I’m wearing my work heels. Easy demand, I say yes every time even when it’s not hotter or easier for me. I sometimes wonder if I’m a pushover for agreeing to this but it’s like .... the demand is easily fulfilled, why risk my chances of getting laid ? \n\nThere’s a few crazier things in the bag I will to try with a partner when they receive my suggestions positively. 
2	i dont have any fetishes but im really kinky and am really open to a lot. only things i wont do are anything with kids, corpses, animals, feet, vomit, or scat. otherwise im essentially an open book and will definitely try anything at least once
5	How to choose career for ESTP?	Man i m studying machine learning and thinking to build a career in it and have a computer degree. As an ESTP, i im into mid life crisis and finding it very difficult to choose a forward career path. And even in my head pops some noise as "something leadership" always from time to time. ESTP has pursuasion word written all over it and even my dad is sales manager. It also embaffeles me to huge extent that although i watched many netflix shows like GOT, Fargo etc but why do i from time to time just watch sherlock again and again and again and even never get bored. Even\nI just want some advice from other fellow ESTP's man how they are approaching life paths and keeping options open.\nI just dont know what to do!( and it really goes into my veins and head these thoughts of wasting time)\nAlso how is maths for ESTP, i mean deep maths because ML and AI is all maths and how we are into field of research.\nI also find studying about entrepreneurship fascinating but if at time we dont have ideas popping how to be one.\nI also think ESTP are psychopaths or sociopaths.\nGrateful for any tips about choosing careers!
3	Are you able to focus enough on research and deep learning/math to enjoy that career? The most important thing you can do is just choose something. Don’t get stuck analyzing all your options. Choose something. Change if you need to. Leadership will come naturally in any role. 
2	choose what makes you money and then pursue your passion

1	I went to uni to become a teacher, did not pay attention, failed a class. Said fuck it apprentiship here I Come. \n\nGot a Job shift maneger Job after apprentiship, 60 people daytime 30 people evening at the sausage factory, Loved it big Numbers and pressure.\n\nGot tired of it after a few years changed to departement manager at a chicken factory. Loved it! For 1 Year, then I had to mive my line to the other side of the country.\n\nSaid fuck it, am now studying to become a high school teacher at restaurant and foodmanufactoring (Norwegian system), and got a Job at my local high school. After I finish I guess I will do it for a few years, maybe take some math to be able to do more later.\n\nI have a 5 Year plan, goals that can be messured "start an education" "care for my marriage" and a few projects. And points on how to do it "I would like to study, teaching or economics/leadership"... It can be broken, but it gives me a focus without beeing locked down.\n\nEverytime I start something I have a frame for how long the minimum time I have invested in it. New Job, I finish school in 2 years, then I can quit if I want to, or stay. But I know everything but my wife and children have a date I can say "FUCK IT, IM OUT" and start Looking around.\n\nThe beauty of this is that I always have my feelers out for something better/cooler and still not Looking like a quiter at my CV. So put on your big boy pants, stop whining and aim for all grades to be A. Become better push yourself, compete against the best you! That is how you stay focused, that is how you win in your own game. Become better, life is a game to crush! 
7	Confused of if I’m a ENTP or ESTP	Could someone please give examples of what distinguishes them? I usually get results as an ENTP but most tests are rigged to the N side instead of S so I’m confused. I tend to take crazy risks like an ESTP but I am always in my head and have trouble paying attention to things because I’m daydreaming. I also an vey honest and straightforward. I am pretty good at puzzles and figuring things out.
5	I'm sort of in the same boat. Have had entp, entj, then estp as results. I tend to think the latter is correct because I'm very sensory. I love to touch things, eat good food and am very good at sensing other people, moods and ambiences. Often in customer meetings I have a wildly different opinion about the outcome than my colleagues because I pay more attention to how they behave rather than what they actually said.\n\nNow, almost everyone enjoy a great meal, but while my peers say it's good I'm having a fucking orgasm in my mouth.\n\nThe thing that puts me the most off with the entp type is the devil's advocate thing. That role is simply not me and something I never do. Also debating is tiresome and often boring. I manage 30 people at work and I don't have time for that stuff.
3	Do you find it hard to stay on topic when you discuss something?\n\nAre you able to focus on one topic and reach a conclusion?\n\nDoes gathering your thoughts become energizing to you?\n\nDo you find it easy to figure out the best method for yourself?\n\nIn honesty, your strike me as an ESTP and I'll tell you why when you answer my questions
3	Pretty easy to distinguish. I'd think ESTP or ESFP would be easier to confuse.
2	Try carefully reading through socionics profiles and seeing which ones you identify with.

14	Angry at people sometimes?	IDK if it's just me, but do you guys sometimes get irrationally angry at people when you have nothing else to do? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes I sit by myself, then start observing people, then start getting mad at how many dumb people exist in the world. Then start worrying about how many more people are going to exist, how the world is going to get overpopulated and how everything is going to turn chaotic and we're not really doing anything much about it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nExample mini story:\n\n1) Told to sit and wait in the car alone\n\n2) After probably almost an hour of fidgeting, get bored and start thinking about stuff\n\n3) Observe girl buying a starbucks with a mac laptop, typical\n\n4) Get mad that she bought an overpriced cup of coffee and laptop with a terrible OS \[but not as bad as win10 tbf\]\n\n5) Worry that millions more of these kinds of people exist, start thinking that people must be really dumb\n\n6) See traffic and lots of people honking to get to work, start thinking existentially and get mad about working \~20 years to pay off a house these days (in California), and student loan debt and we are still complacent about this.\n\n7) \[insert more angry angst here\]\n\n8) Gets pumped up, but then gets back home and chills out when I find something to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know it sounds edgy, but I'm not actually a person to think about these kinds of stuff (only when I'm bored). I think it's a demon thing for ESTPs to be left alone with nothing to do. If I get this mad because I'm bored idk about you guys? \n\nType if you relate fam
6	Can't relate. Would be annoyed if the starbucks girl was a caffeine addict though since its a crutch. Would get annoyed if people aren't aware of their surroundings and are blocking the stairway/street or walking slow
2	When I'm bored, I usually think about my personal problems. In this time the craziest solutions come to my mind. And I see them actually like a good one. But often I'm tired of people and than get angry. I love company. But sometimes people around me are too sensitive and they complain about every little thing, take things too personally and die in their own misery. In this moment they expect, that I'll give them my energy. It's so tiring. Then I get frustrated and I start to be angry and mean to this people. 
1	Ahahaha
1	Lol yeah I do but you just sound like a poorfag teenager. 
1	Seems like you usually use your Ni. INFJ here
5	Se-Fe loop advantages	What's a good way to take advantage of this loop aka our most extroverted functions in daily life
1	I dont even know bro. Fe loops makes us crave attention like a douche.
1	Go to a bunch of parties, bars, and social gatherings\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou'll make connections but not any meaningful ones, but you never know  
12	Tried to date one of you...	Met an ESTP many moons ago, loved his energy and mannerisms, his clear strengths in social situations (met him while he was bartending), but also his ability to offer new perspectives and explanations for patterns in the world, not as well as myself but... not too shabby either. He has a strong intellectual side. Just an interesting human. Ended up being so enamored that I gave him my number (very unusual for me, just thought he was so great). To provide some context here, I was also 100% sober. So yeah, enamored!\n\nWe talked over text for a while & went on a date. I wasn’t sure how it went since I’m introverted & I was super nervous. Didn’t have alcohol to help me because I don’t drink. \n\nAfter the date he listed future days he’d be free, told me he thought of me as exceptionally smart and pretty, asked me what I thought of him, and seemed to want to keep things going.\n\nHe kept mentioning grabbing coffee & then rendezvousing to Bloomingdales to help him pick out a new winter coat. He’d literally been talking about it for days and called me the day of to set up concrete plans, but then called me to say something came up — a “meeting” that sounded more like “bar with friends” to my ears. He works in the music industry, so it could very well have been a legit meeting in a casual setting, but it seemed off to me. \n\nI was disappointed but tried to be understanding. I had already gotten ready. He gave me the option to meet later that day when he could get away from his other stuff, so I set that up & waited for hours for him to show, thinking he would follow through since he was texting me updates. He never did.\n\nWhen the first thing out of his mouth the next day wasn’t an apology but a bunch of excuses that very much sounded like lies, I ended things. I sited not being able to see someone casually or otherwise who doesn’t respect my time & energy, and who can’t apologize with sincerity when they are in the wrong. \n\nI really think he thought I’d be cool. But the inconsiderateness (and probable dishonesty) got to me. I think he thought he could do whatever he wanted that day and then talk himself out of the situation the next day. It killed my attraction to him overnight. He tried to keep in touch with me & I stopped texting him.\n\nEdit: Damn. Didn’t realize that was so long before I posted. Guess I had a lot to get off my chest.\n\nTD;LR: Met a cool ESTP, thought things were going well, ended things because I was concerned with his lack of follow through and inconsiderateness. I guess I’m looking for insight? Or just commiseration. 🙃
8	I feel guilty because I've totally done this. He could just have trouble actually following through with plans. I can totally relate to that. Sometimes I just kinda don't feel like going out, even if I've made plans. I'm not going to do something if I don't feel like it at that time, but I do feel guilty when I flake on plans. Planning things out isn't really my thing, although I really can't speak for other ESTPs. 
9	This sounds really rude of him, so I don’t blame you. Good on you for respecting your time early on.  
4	OP, maybe your personality type could give us some insight. What is it?
4	He may have had other obligations come up that ran over time.  He may have felt meh about going shopping as the day went on. He may have lost track of time. Could be anything. \n\nIt wasn't a date with dinner reservations.  He called you the day of, told you there was  a change of plans, then texted you updates and called you the next day, and tried to keep in touch after.  How familiar are you with the type?  Sticking to social plans is  exactly  the opposite of what we're known for.
2	I'm married to this type. He went out of his way not to be like this . . . on my birthday. The other 364 days of the year, all bets are off.\n\nThey seem to be spontaneous and flow with the moment. It's great if they're with you and you're sharing the moment. He taught me to be happy, so it was worth the annoyance, for me.
2	No type is more trustworthy than the next
1	Did he maybe think you were taking it too seriously? If he felt under pressure to do something serious he might have just felt too uncomfortable. Just a thought. 
1	What type are you? This happened to me, too, but not on a date, just as a friend he bailed on me. Said he'd be at a certain place at a certain time, then when I texted where is he, he didn't respond for days or months. He just says whatever he wants, then doesn't follow through. Wtf is up with that? That's so stupid. He has charisma in person, but there's no point being friends with him if he can't even follow a plan, like wtf, that just kills his whole reputation. I've seen him as a liar in more than this just one instance, too. Is this an ESTP trait, or just some shitty cultural trait? Like saying you'll do something when you're there with the person, just so you won't have to say "no" to them, as if that is supposed to spare their feelings, yet actually does the opposite and makes it even worse when your trust is betrayed. 
-2	u were too easy, lost interest
1	My dad is an ESTP	All of my siblings and other family members have tried to figure out why he is 100% okay with saying something negative about someone, but as soon as anyone else says the same exact thing about said person, he will literally defend that person and treat them to be the underdog. \n\nAnd that’s not the only thing he does, he’s always trying control the conversation. We could be saying the same exact thing, BUT he will argue it and try to make a point, while you’re standing there, thinking “I literally just said this.” \n\nHelp me understand this part of his personality, please. I understand cognitive functions really well. I just haven’t gone that much in depth with his type, yet. 
7	Sounds more like ENTP, my guy.
3	Are you sure he doesn't just have a narcissistic personality disorder? This doesn't sound like an ESTP trait??? Or am I wrong?
3	?
3	My dad is very similar to this, (ESTP according to the 16 personalities test) and I came to this sub to try to understand him better, cause the same issues confuse/frustrate me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nControls the narrative of situations.\n\nUnwilling to listen to conflicting opinions, and doesn't want to hear them (literally shuts down the conversation)\n\nWill still get upset that your "unwilling to understand/listen where he's coming from."\n\n(But you effing are listening...you're just giving an alternate opinion)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUses things against you for millennia, however if you bring up something he's done you're being "unfair, and need to let things go"\n\nJust impossibly contradictory, and denies or acts blind to all these contradictions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work with him, and strangely he seems to be capable of extreme empathy, understanding, and open-mindedness in a professional environment, just not a familial one. It's kinda mind-fucky, and it confuses my other family members as well.\n\nInteresting to see a lot of people saying this isn't an ESTP thing.
2	?
1	He also discourages big picture ideas, wants to make sure you keep an eye on the little things. 
3	Keeping a global view	Anyone else get the sinking feeling that the entire world isn't right rn and not necessarily fubar but with a general lack of direction and the current state is sort of unacceptable and needs to be saved..
8	Not really. I think that people are getting way too sensitive
4	I blame liberals
3	I think it's just always like that. Like really, when was it ever not fucked up? It can only be fucked up because people think it is. So, I'm not sure how wise it is to want to "save" the world. Just make the most of it, ya know?
2	Come join us at r/zerowaste to save it
7	Smoke?	Almost every ESTP i Know vapes or smokes regularly. Does this just happen to be the ones I know? Haha they also start drinking very early in the morning and I love it
7	I have never smoked, and I never will. \nDrinking however is reserved for after 5pm, and shall be consumed in excessive amounts 
7	I think, it's not about the personality. Like I 'm ESTP and smoking is so adominate for me. I also start drinking later than my generation. I think, it's more about upbringing in childhood. Chlidern, whose are held very straight, has more tendencies to do something banned. 
6	I feel there is two types of ESTPs.\n1. The party type (prolly smokes)\nOr the\n2. Sporty type (doesnt smoke)\n\nSo depending on which you are..\nMy BF is a cyclist ( and ESTP), he has never touched a cigarette. I do however know some ESTPs who smoke
5	I'm not extroverted and I do a bit more than smoke.
3	true
2	no i was raised as an intx
2	I've never been able to afford to smoke lol. Its cool as shit though, might start in the future. I'll smoke weed though no problem. 
1	Used to, not anymore. Recovering alcoholic though. Us and ENFPs are in recovery, see them there all the time.

2	I would've expected this to be in r/intp
4	Need sex advice for estp	Help! I'm an INFP newly married to ESTP husband. When we were dating we had a lot of sex. He couldn't keep his hands off me and typically had an erection any time we were near each other. Lol. I thought our sex drives were a good match. \n\nWe abstained for a while before marriage and it was really difficult. We talked about having sex after marriage, fantasies, doing it "like rabbits" (his words) etc. He knew I wanted it every day. I would kind of joke about that and he would always say "no" but I figured it would be like earlier in our relationship when we had it several times a week, sometimes every day.  \n\nWell, we didn't have sex on our wedding night. Then only a couple of times that first week and he seemed like he didn't really want to do it. I was confused so a week into our marriage I told him it seemed like he didn't want it as much as me so what did he want me to do? Should I initiate? (He has always said prior to marriage he would love for me to do that.)  He got kind of mad about it and said he was aware how much I wanted it and we shouldn't talk about it. I ended up crying and he left me to go sleep on the couch!  Then I was afraid to bring it up.  We've talked a little bit since then but I dont want to say too much and push him away.  Mentioning sex at all seems to turn him off. Like I dont even think I could send him a flirty text or pics.\n\nI don't initiate because if I start touching him he will stop me. He doesn't like to kiss. So I just suppress my desires so I dont go crazy and I wait until he is ready. Then I have to get turned on quickly because he is fast and aggressive.  Sometimes it's hard for me to finish due to lack of foreplay and he gets frustrated because he could be done in a few minutes.  So that adds to the problem.\n\nI'm trying to figure out how to get him back to his normal sex loving ESTP self. If he would allow me to initiate I could get him going but he seems almost stubborn about not having sex as often as I'd like. A couple of times he has seemed to relax a bit and acts like himself (sex 2 days in a row, maybe 3x a week) then we go a few weeks only having sex once a week. \n\nI think some of it is that he is under a lot if pressure from all the added responsibilities but he puts a lot of pressure on himself. I have a hard time getting him to relax. But I don't know what to do about that. \n\nDo you have any advice? 
5	You might want to try r/deadbedrooms instead. Some people lose interest after marriage, like the “chase” is gone— seems like a semi-common theme over on that sub. Is there anything particularly stressful going on in his life currently, that could cause a loss of libido. Bottom line is communication is key here, you have to talk about it. Therapy sounds like a good idea, the sooner the better lest you wake up ten years from now stuck in a miserable marriage. 
4	Hiii, I am an ESTP male dating an INFP female for a little over a year and a half. I would like to start by saying my gf is amazing and has taught me new-found appreciation for INFPs and for people who empathize naturally.. which we ESTPs do not....\n\nI was wondering the timeline of your relationship? The thing about ESTP fantasies is they are much bigger and doable in our heads than reality usually permits..\n\nWhy didn’t you have sex on your wedding night...? That seems off.. Also, when I was in college and had a friends with benefits situation going on, once every 1.5 weeks was what I preferred. It didn’t start that way, but that’s eventually where it ended up via my choice. Also also, he left you to go sleep on the couch after he made you cry?! I hope he can learn to appreciate the times you are actually willing to divulge your inner feelings to him. Those divulgences are hard to come by and should be cherished, even if they are hard for the ESTP to comprehend and swallow. Keep sharing your feelings no matter how they make him feel !!! Stay strong and get what you want !!
3	He's probably going through stress and anxiety. Does he go to the gym at all? Yoga would help too. But estp loses desire when he is locked into a cage with strict boundaries. Maybe his job, or maybe you guys need a vacation, that always helps reset the mind of an estp. Also maybe try being aggressive overly so if possible, that will excite him more than anything, gotta tap into that tert si and be ferocious. But remember that is just the ignition when he gets started give him the keys to the ferrari. Try and make it look as attractive as possible, maybe do light workouts to tone your body. As long as he is a normal functioning adult he won't need to relax that is not the estp way lol
-1	tap into your evolutionary side. FEEL your energy ramping up, feed off his energy, feed it into yours. fuck like rabbits, don't think about anything and just let nature take its course while you engage in the most intimate thing a man and woman can do.   \n\n\nif hes being lame and isnt doing his job, then do yours better. he will mimic your energy, vice versa 
4	Career for ESTP	Hi! I'd like to ask you about your jobs. Why are you heated in?  I have to choose, what I want to study and I'm pretty lost. I'm grateful for any tip. 
4	Try to do something which is applicable to the real world.\n\nI studied biochemistry at first, but dropped out due to it being too abstract. I switched to Biology, more practical and easier to focus, since a lot of things you learn by hands-on experience.
4	Hey! Right now I’m an account manager for a food vending company in San Francisco. I enjoy interacting with my clients and handing day to day operations. I’m studying accounting because I enjoy the logic and real world applications. One day I’d like to manage my own firm or run my own business. 
2	Hello, I am a UC Berkeley English Graduate and a hard ESTP. Don’t think I would have gotten my degree without my father’s (INFJ) planning and persistence.. At least not at the age I did. I am a manager at an In-N-Out Burger and while I do enjoy the work (fast-paced, structured, people-oriented), I do not enjoy the schedule (days, nights, weekends). I just passed the English CSET multiple choice tests and am waiting to hear back on the two essay tests. Eventually I would like to be an English teacher, first High School, then Community College. I’ve learned to love school and am terribly excited at the prospect of returning. I plan to tutor English whilst there, as well as run some bar karaoke nights, a part-time position for which I have been offered, but cannot commit to due to my schedule.
2	I’m ESTP, currently working in advertising, being trained in entrepreneurship by a boss. The advertising industry was the perfect industry for me, because it gives me the option to work in a creative area, or a strategic area depending on how I’m feeling. \n
1	Law and music but I am close to ISTP
1	Go with trades and music for fun
1	Man i m studying machine learning and thinking to build a career in it and have a computer degree. As an ESTP, i im into mid life crisis and finding it very difficult to choose a forward career path. And even in my head pops some noise as "something leadership" always from time to time. ESTP has pursuasion word written all over it and even my dad is sales manager. It also embaffeles me to huge extent that although i watched many netflix shows like GOT, Fargo etc but why do i from time to time just watch sherlock again and again and again and even never get bored. Even\nI just want some advice from other fellow ESTP's man how they are approaching life paths and keeping options open.\nI just dont know what to do!( and it really goes into my veins and head these thoughts of wasting time)\nAlso how is maths for ESTP, i mean deep maths because ML and AI is all maths and how we are into field of research.\nI also find studying about entrepreneurship fascinating but if at time we dont have ideas popping how to be one.\nI also think ESTP are psychopaths or sociopaths.\nGrateful for any tips about choosing careers!
1	Mechanic in the military. Stationed in Europe. \n\nIt’s good. I like the culture. Could use some more freedom though. 
5	What do ESTP girls think about INTJ guys	
10	I’m an ExTP \n\nSome of them are really funny and have the same “no filter” humor that I do. Some are pompous assholes who have nothing better to do than bitch about what everyone else is doing wrong. Personally it really depends on the person — if we’re hanging out in the first place then that means I don’t care about whatever personality flaws you may have— we all have things about us that piss other people off, I’m not gonna fault anyone for that 
5	Hahah hmmm... I am always attracted to INTJ guys but they are a lot of dramaaaa. No offense. They tend to like to spill all their life details onto me and I'm like oh gosh... help. I know people say INTJs are cold but I haven't found that to be true. I really do appreciate how they are very direct and unafraid of talking about difficult subjects. In fact, I credit my INTJ ex for encouraging me to communicate better in relationships. 
3	Insecure and jealous of our popularity. If they got over it things would be great
2	Well, I can't comment on the chemistry between you and the person you're eyeing up. What I can say is that I click really well with INTJs for whatever reason. I've met one INTJ woman, I definitely liked her, but for specific reasons not to do with personality type, I never tried to make a move. So I guess there's no reason to think an ESTP girl wouldn't be attracted to an INTJ guy's personality type.
2	I’ve had a couple INTJ friends and some relationships with them.\n\nI personally find them very interesting and intelligent individuals. What I like is how they can defend their beliefs adequately and also appreciate lots of non PC humor and be willing to go out and explore/experiment. They can be helpful and provide me honest feedback and perceive things that I can’t (how I’m behaving, what seems to be bothering me, inconsistencies in me, etc.). I love it when the loosen up, let go, and have fun! I find them to be dependable people and true to their words. They are good at judging things as well. Overall, we generally have great chemistry.\n\nThe bad parts is that sometimes they can be very defensive or stuck up about their opinions being right and it ends up being a huge argument over who is ignorant and who isn’t. Some INTJs keep a lot of stuff inside and just explode whenever, so be careful. Also you have to respect their personal space, and their tendencies (arrive early please) or they will lose respect for you. Some can like u/sosnazzy said be pompous assholes which is annoying. But overall I think INTJs are really nice it’s just the rough exterior they have but internally they are all fuzzy and warm (if you point this out to an INTJ, they will start getting defensive but we know it’s true :p)
2	Had a weird relationship with one for something like 3 years. Posted about it in r/intj, you can check my history. Bottom line: we aren't in contact anymore, his mind was too closed. Had we actually spoken about things we would be perfect, but alas his ego. 
2	Most of my friends are INTJ or INTP. Not sure why I gravitate to them, we just get along well. Depends on the person, but the ones I know are really easy for me to get along with.
1	I know a couple of INTJs. They are usually quite pompous/condescending. Really fun and interesting at first, but when you begin to see through that, it's not fun at all anymore. In my experience, they're actually quite insecure which is why they seem so insanely awesome and exicint up front. They front load all the things they think make them cool and then when you hear those stories 50 more times over the friendship, it get's boring. They don't seem to actually be going out and doing much. I'm out in the world living and don't want to hear old stories over and over again. \n\nedit: I'm an ESTP female and have known these things to be true for both genders of INTJ. 
10	At what age did everything just start clicking for you?	
8	probably like 24. 4 years later and shits still clicking though. I'm kinda pissed and bitter no one taught me how to win at life while I was growing up. I'm having to figure it out on my own but if I'd have known what I know now 15 years ago I would've been a powerhouse.
3	Pretty much just this summer. Was 20, now I'm 21. Yeah, I've got a lot left to figure out, but I would say it's "clicked". 
2	around 22 for me. \nhad a breakup that made me take a hard look at myself and made a lot of positive changes to my life\n\nthe introduction of psilocybin mushrooms to my life at 24 also made a lot of things click.
1	Literally the moment I turned 23 and that was last week 
1	At 23, which was this year, it clicked that I was ESTP. Still don't know what career I want
6	What do ESTPs think about ISFPs?	kinda curious. 
6	I dunno about anyone else, but I personally find them pretty alright. They're usually fairly chill, though I've not met very many. Fi is weird though, I can't even get my head around it man.
4	ESTPs generally get along. \n\nISFPs can turn into cunts real quick though. Same with INFPs. \n
3	I’ve had 2 mother in-laws both were ISFP, they’re very interesting and adventurous when getting their way and very haughty, self righteous , and self centered when unhappy with their life situations.
1	one of my closest friends is an isfp. i think they have just the right amount of differences but similarities to where we can at least get along
1	Their awesome 
1	They are morally righteous at all times, I am not
1	Not devoid of positives but easily hurt and hard to communicate with, but that’s just my personal opinion
1	I like them far too much for my own good. Though I'm not sure all ESTPs are gonna feel the same way.
1	I don’t like em.\n\n
6	Vincent Swan from White Gold	I've been watching the BBC show White Gold and I'm trying to understand what MBTI type he is. I thought that he could be an ESTP. What are your thoughts?
19	Girl ESTPs?	Yo where the girl ESTPs at? \n\nI’ve actually never met one, and just wanted to know if any are on here! \n\nIf you are, just wondering. Do guys find your personality attractive? I feel like my ESTP type draws a lot of men to me because we’re generally adventurous and fun and pretty blunt and low drama, but I’m not sure if anyone else has noticed this in regards to gender. \n\nAlso this post is not to sound conceited! We definitely have weaknesses as a type too. Just wanted to know if any other girl ESTPs read this and want to discuss the life experience of being a rare type, in regards to dating but also just other things as well since I feel like our type doesn’t lead us to follow our traditional gender role. 
9	Met an estp girl a couple months ago. Instantly it's like we knew each other. Exactly like me but in a female form I swear. It's not that I found her looks attractive, although they were incredible, it was her personality I was drawn to..
7	I'm an ESTP female. I definitely get the sense that men can be into me regarding the "bro" side of my personality, but I am typically the one to decide if the relationship will be romantic or not, and I make that decision clear and stick to it. I can be very charming and bluntly flirtatious, but if I am not romantically interested, I will act extremely casual and uninviting to romantic advances.\n\n  \nI have an unreal number of platonic male friends. I love to hang out with "frat bro" types because they're fun as hell and are always down for anything, but don't find them necessarily challenging to me intellectually, or make me reconsider my perspective on...anything. So as a result I've dated social but nerdy engineers, consistently. I guess I just find them really interesting? I can't say. I love hanging with girls too, but we don't always care about the same things, and even if I enjoy partying with them a lot, they don't  seem fulfilled with my disinterest in basic girl stuff lol, so we drift easily.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn regards to dating history, I dated two super respectable ESTJs long-term pretty successfully, had one VERY fast-paced/fast-ending relationship with an ESFJ, and got really caught up on a brilliant and wildly fascinating ENTP (to this day still kind of am...the challenge, I guess). We had very similar values but our communication styles caused massive problems and we fought all the time, which is super not normal for me. Dude seriously made me crazy, beware of ENTPs lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn general, and this may DEFINITELY be flawed, I feel like I could get anyone I wanted if I really set my mind to it. Could be part of just being a woman. When a bf and I break up, I always find someone new pretty easily. But yeah, the "unique" ones are the only ones I ever actually seem to be interested in...but they aren't as fun or easy going?...it's an eternal struggle. In true ESTP fashion I have no fkn clue what I want 
6	I'm here!  I'd say people do tend to find my personality attractive, sadly they usually don't find my appearance quite so attractive . . . But I've always had a wide friend group, both men and women, and my male friends often describe me as being "like one of the guys."
5	I’m ESTx and I feel like I just seem to attract cocky or creepy shy guys… it’s probably just me :(
5	I’m an 24f ESTP time and time again. I would say that a lot of men find me attractive and charming and it’s flattering to a certain point. The point is when you’re not interested in dating or hooking up and the men take that as a challenge. I’m generally a kind person so when these advances come my way, it takes some emotional energy to let that person know that I’m not available and I probably won’t be for a while. \n\nMy relationship experiences have mostly been longer term, and I try to really get to know the person that I’m dating. I feel your dating history OP, that’s about the same as me. I find really intelligent people attractive and I like people who come off as very unique.
4	I'm a female ESTP! Yeah, guys are often drawn to me because I'm so "blunt and down to hangout." But being down to hangout gets me in trouble cause sometimes guys like to assume you're down for... anything... when I'm really actually not smh. A lot of people say I'm really easy to talk to and they feel comfortable around me. I'm usually drawn to unique guys as well. When basically any guy can be drawn to you, only the unique ones are interesting lol. 
2	I don't know how to properly type so I don't know if I've met one
2	I’m 20f ESTP-A! \nMost guys seem to really enjoy how confident I am. Eg: I lead the date (pick the restaurant, decide what to order, drop hints about what I want etc). \nI’m very outgoing and talkative, and all of my tinder dates compliment how they feel like I’m really easy to get along with. \n\nMy boyfriend is great, he handles me taking on too much, or working late, or being the host of the party and not seeing him very often, really well. I think we’re a good match because there’s literally no gender roles in our relationship. He does the dishes, I build the flat pack furniture, (and if I need a work out, he’ll let me squat him haha). \n\nWe made a loose verbal agreement that he’d stay at home and look after the kids (if we have them in the future), while I run my own business. \n\nSomething that I’d love to ask the other female ESTPs is; \nDo you find it hard to find/make friends that you admire?\n\nI know I’m very young, which can make it hard for me to find people that have that same ‘need to succeed’ complex I think a lot of ESTP have. Most of my friends always complement me and admire how hard I work, but I can never find young people who I can look up to! 
2	Yes absolutely they find my personality attractive.\n\nI’m actually an ESTPf (20) and I have a lot of guy friends because of it. I don’t actively look for guy friends, I’m actually just friendly with everyone. But it’s just that the people I’m with tend to be guys because we share the same hobbies and attitude (computers, video games, business, drifting cars, hiking, etc). \n\nOf my relationships, the types that tend to fall for me tend to ironically be IxTJs. But they comment that I’m very honest, chill, and not afraid to defend myself, intellectually stimulating to them, and a savage meme master. It’s just communication issues where it ends up not working out because we have different standards for each other and I’m still in college so I have to push them away sometimes :/\n\nAnyways hopefully this helps anyone\nStill looking for an ENTPm though LOL 
3	here yo! I have a female best friend who’s ESTP and she rocks.  \n\nMale ESTPs are usually annoying dicks and love themselves way too much. I can’t trust them because I know how they think. They’re fun tho until they’re annoying 
1	Also yes love to discuss dating experiences, in the absolute WOAT 
1	ESTP woman here. Hell yes, men still find my personality attractive (I’m 55). I hate drama, but love excitement. I’m happily in an open relationship with my INFP partner.\n\nLike others posting here, I have lots of male friends (am totally “one of the guys”), have a hella time relating to other women, am attracted to nerdy computer engineers.
1	Hi I am one as well.\n\nMen are either wildly attracted to me or afraid. I've had good relationships with ENFP and a weirdly strange attraction with INTJ. I met an ESTP guy once and I think we could have been perfect together, as friends at the very least. I miss him but he lives halfway around the world. 
1	hi
46	I just came here to say why I love ESTPs and ISTPs	Every time I've met an XSTP in real life, I have found them fascinating, full of wit/hilarious and, above all, *grounding*.  I can sometimes get lost in my own head too easily, thus, sometimes it's so rewarding to be around others who will just say *exactly* what's on their mind- and usually with more confidence than I ever could.  Even though there's a stereotype about STPs- especially ISTPs being cold and mean, I've found most of you guys to be perfectly pleasant to be around.  Honestly, most of the time, this "meanness" was actually pretty well justified when I have seen it.  Indeed: you guys will say what a lot of people are secretly thinking (and this is often stuff I'm afraid to even admit to *myself*).\n\nTwo of my closest friends are an ESTP and an ISTP.  They are incredibly fun to be around, and although, in many ways, they're extremely different from me, I often find these differences to be utterly delightful- watching them laugh and make jokes through gruesome scenes in movies and video games that I would usually be wincing through.  Watching them fearlessly getting right up close to and even messing around with video game dangers that I steer *well* clear of when it's my turn.  They also rarely perceive others as above vs beneath them, and I really love that about them.  They have helped me to grow as a person and encouraged me to live more in the moment, learn to laugh, rather than cry at negative things, not to take things too seriously all the time and to just be more "indifferent" to the world in general.\n\nYou guys might be the "coolest" types.  :3
20	:) \nwhen I was reading your post I thought "this must be an INFP" then read your post history and looks like I guessed right. \n\nThanks for being authentically you, even on the internet- \n2 of my siblings are INFP and the thing I most admire about them is their authentic, pure intentions in their interactions with others.  Keep doing you!
15	We love you too! 😊
10	INFP here.... When I was in Uni I found myself befriending two guys ISTP and ESTP. Basically everything you said.\n\nI think my emotional nature and expressions when talking about things I’m passionate about was amusing to the ISTP who would often purposely rile me up while trying not to crack a smile or laugh and see how long he could keep it going before I noticed I’m being trolled. I’d be so pissed and he found it hilarious, but we never really argued or fought, he’s far too chill for that.\n\nESTP and I would often have small arguments and what I loved about him is how easily he’d let go and within a short time we were just bantering and joking around about something else. He was considered ‘mean’ by so many people but at least he never held a grudge, like ever. And he was honest, unlike most people. I respect that. But I was super honest too hence why we’d often clash. But despite any clashes we still remained friends, we could still joke and laugh or share experiences. I love that we are both highly individualistic yet accepting of each other.\n\nIf he went too far with comments or hurting others the  ISTP would always be the one to diffuse the situation. In a light-hearted way. Making fun of the ESTP but still pointing out things he’s doing. I liked watching their friendship grow and I’m glad I was the one who brought them together in the first place 😂. I also enjoyed watching the ESTP make fun of the ISTP. It was nice he met his match.\n\nMan I miss them, but they’ve both moved to different countries. Life goes on.
4	Do you find that you can talk deep psychology, philosophy, etc with ESTPs? Also this is funny because 2 of my best friends are INFPs, maybe our types just go well together :) the reason why I love them though is because I find I can talk for hours on end about abstract concepts, but I’m wondering if that’s because of our types or if it’s just different. I feel like that makes me a less “grounded” ESTP, but just wanted to compare to your experience with us :) \n
3	I always see people on the MBTI subs talking about those from certain groups.\n\nHow do you know who's what? Do you often, like, ask people? And then they know what you're talking about?
2	I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n- [/r/istp] [I just came here to say why I love ESTPs and ISTPs](https://www.reddit.com/r/istp/comments/a37r5q/i_just_came_here_to_say_why_i_love_estps_and_istps/)\n\n&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
5	You're Now My New Friend...	Recently found out that I get along famously with ESTPs.\n\nI'd give you my info but...trust is something I don't believe in.\n\nSo, heres my PSN Username: Mortaldeadking < I'm 17 so after a certain age limit it'll be considered some Chris Hanson shit. So, if you've PSN and your between 15-24 we must play Red Dead 2 Online together. See you there bro!
5	INFP Wife Considering ESTP Husband's Christmas Gift	I'm an INFP looking to "create" a gift for my ESTP husband (I'm poor lol). For his birthday, I wrote him a short story where he basically woke up on his own time, started a fire, drank coffee, and left his snowy cabin in the woods to go out and test survival equipment with friends. He loved that and he's not a big reader. He had me read it to him, which he generally likes better. \n\nI'm looking to do something similar--either another story or some kind of craft. I made him a blanket when he was on deployment in 2016,  which he loves. He's home this Christmas thankfully so I'd like to give him something meaningful despite limited funds. Do ESTPs generally like meaningful gifts? So many forums say the opposite. \n\nI know ESTPs typically like experiences too. But where to go for free in the cold? \n\nI also have a general curiosity about the relationship between ESTPs and gifts:\n\nHe's seemed to like the more craft-centered things I've done that speak more to his specific likes than things I thought he would find useful and like more. Ive asked about practical gifts before (like knives/coffee makers for the field/etc.) but he's very particular on the brand/type of whatever the object is. Particular to the point he can come off very mean when the gift isn't to his liking. He also hates giftcards that have only enough money to be used for one meal or at places he rarely goes to. He has said he would rather get nothing from someone rather than a "stupid gift" even though some of these gifts should, in theory, fit what he likes. It's strange to me, but his particularness makes me highly aware that my choices for him are often "wrong." Is this common among ESTPs? \n\nThoughts?
5	Make him something he’ll have to think of you with some cute meaning, without any kind of use or purpose. Otherwise you’ll get offended when he points out how it could be better designed or made. 
5	Make something by hand and give it that INFP charm.\n\nSource: Dating an INFP, one of the sweetest gifts I’d ever received was an origami flower representing everlasting devotion.
2	Hello, ESTP male here dating an INFP female. She bought me a very nice bottle opener with the coordinates of our first date and a little heart. Stays on my keys and goes with me wherever I go.. practical and meaningful — can’t go wrong with that !! I generally prefer receiving practical gifts, so if one can get me something practical with meaning attached to it, they win :)
3	please help me determine if my cousin is an estp?	she is 15y/o and is an asian if that helps! :D\n\nif i remember correctly, when she was young she would always cry at new and strange environments like in nursery but will then be very energetic when she gets used to it. i also remember clearly that she was very loud with her cousin (or people she's familiar with) that's around her age and she would always boss them around and do all sorts of crazy things that's inappropriate. \n\n\nshe now finds it hard to verbalise her thoughts well and often get into clashes with overly-sensitive people. i've heard that many of her friends call her insensitive and unemphathetic when she told me that she was trying to help them "in another way" and that her actions were often misunderstood as that. she also has trouble with authority and rebels hard, especially with people that tries to control her or limit her actions. she told me that she knows little of her feelings and doesn't like wallowing in them. i'm convinced by now that she is an ExTP, except that ENTP is very possible as well. \n\n\nshe seeks adrenaline-pumping activites but has limited access to it giving her place of residence and thus dedicates herself to working out. she's extremely determined and feels out of place when she doesn't work out for a few days. she has pretty good reflexes but sometimes acts before she thinks, leading to trouble.\n\ni wouldn't exactly call her a "leader" or "alpha" as most ESTPs are described as, since she has severe anxiety around most guys and some strangers (though she acts like nothing is bothering her) and unless she's familiar with people she wouldn't boss people around since she tries her best to Fe even though she still shows some of those tendencies when she isn't anxious or in depression. she is quiet around people she doesn't mix well with or when she thought they wouldn't click with her. she is also quick to make assumptions and is prone to overthinking at times to the point of paronia. she used to claim to see "ghosts and spirits" and is still afraid of these kind of things. she can analyze well and predict what someone else is thinking or going to do as well. \n\n\nshe is haunted by her past and uses it as a guide for the present and future. she will also react very aggressively when she thinks that something similar to the past is happening again and will use everything in her to prevent it. she is also very quick to learn physical things, and doesn't like to be last. she also tries to be top in everything though she fails at times. \n\n\nplease help me determine if she is in fact estp, thank you!\n
6	Annoying ESTP	Do you find women who want nothing to do with you as a challenge? I can't get one to leave me alone. I've been blunt and told him to go away and he still comes back. I don't like playing games and I'm getting irritated by the constant boundary pushing. Do you think ignoring him would be the best idea?  
7	If you aren't interested then stop talking to him\n\n\nThey are a challenge and in my own experience they eventually budge and have fun. \n\nBut if someone is telling me to go away I wouldn't be still nagging. \n\n\ngotta realize that sometimes it has nothing to do with a mbti type but rather a dumbass 
2	He should’ve stopped, idk why he didn’t
1	Doesn’t sound like ESTP to me. We’re usually so perceptive we don’t waste our time on relationship non-starters in the first place.
1	Aren’t all ESTPs annoying?
9	Old man describes ESTPs pretty well	[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV3TmN55cFg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV3TmN55cFg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWow accurate wtf
3	Your username is such an ESTP username 
3	what a inefficient way to transmit info 
5	Inferior Se prick here	So really,,,,,,, how is it that you use Se?????? getting trapped in your inside world is fun until you have responsibilities and life. But seriously any help?
8	I mainly use it unconsciously, usually as a stream of input for my Ti. It's hard to explain because unlike what gets written stereotypically, ESTPs do spend a fair amount of time thinking as we're acting, constantly analysing what's going on around us - we just never tell anyone. We also use it to just do things - I often get strong physical cravings and have to satisfy them. Doing things in the real world is much more fun than being stuck in your own head.\n\nMind, Se isn't that much better for dealing with responsibilities than Ni - sure we get more done but we aren't always doing the right thing.
6	.....just..... do..... it......
3	What do you mean?
3	Fucking trees and torturing nerds.\n\nNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERDS
2	Fuck her right in the pussy
30	ESTP=Big Dick Energy	Confident, prone to taking risks, funny, great in a crisis, and an I-dont-give-a-fuck attitude. Clearly we are all alphas. Tell me I'm wrong.
16	I don't give a shit how big my big dick is.
11	It depends on how you use your functions. I knew a guy who was 100% ESTP and although he was aggressive and pretty intelligent(and wanted to be "alpha"), he was still a follower. You have Fe after all, so I think you're overestimating your ability to not give fucks
6	😎
5	unless the degree to which you believe in your own big dick energy ultimately translates into arrogance and thus extremely small dick energy 🤷🏼‍♀️
7	you’re wrong:P 
4	Last one nah 
2	Okay, you’re wrong. And the language you use is insensitive. There’s nothing alpha about the way you speak. It’s fucking embarrassing.
1	E X P A N D\n                 O\n                 N\n 🍆           G
5	Aren't the ESTPs with an overdeveloped Fe the strangest people you know	
12	... no 🧐
3	Would love a concrete example.. Chris Traeger from Parks and Rec maybe? Ive consciously tried to develop my Fe for years now.. It has become stronger and I don’t mind feeling strange. I think my Fe and Ni could and will always need work tho..
7	ketchup on turkey...try it	PSA: turkey is delicious with ketchup.  I had never considered mixing the two until last night.  My tongue is still all wonkey this evening from last night so....\n\nAnyways, have a safe holiday tomarrow, and thank you.\n\nIt isn't as delicious as on and slathered all over chewy and well done steak.....but what could be?  Was awesome.  Accompaning crispy or crunchy steak is so so so so good.  \n\nHappy Thanksgiving\n\n
2	Heathen
2	Huh. So this is what being triggered feels like. Ewww
1	ketchup is cheating when it comes to cooking.\n\n
5	Adam22 from No Jumper - ESTP?	Do you agree with this? He seems like a pretty good example of your type. Let me know what you think\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRFX1zstPKQ\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-Sf3ar589c
2	Yeah I’d say he is ESTP. I definitely relate to how he approached his early financial struggles and what he wanted to do with his life. Even if it’s illegal, you do what you have to do to survive. His idea about things that could have been done in the future (BMX videos online) is another thing I relate to. I also related to his mannerisms of speaking (and so with the interviewer). I felt the interviewer might be ESTP as well because I’d ask the same questions and reply the same. They both seemed to have a lot of chemistry and know each other’s game and respect each other equally.
2	Eww
1	dunno, he doesnt really say much.
13	Please help me find an activity/pepole to fuck around	I am so so so so so bored, all my friends are introverts who would rather stare at a wall than hang out (good people tho) and the city i live in is small, so i have little to no options. Anything will do, idc if it’s illegal, i have been bored my entire life and will probably suicide if this continues.
11	GYMMMMMMM
5	Every ESTP needs a motorbike. Get that and just play around in traffic. It’s fun seeing how upset people get watching you have fun. Also you can join motorbike clubs but welters I live they’re just filled with lame 50 year olds :(
5	Also I forgot to mention I am extremly extroverted and so fucking lonely because people my age usually find me outrageous/are basically the least interesting people on earth
4	What do you like to do? Find some hobbies, that’s how people connect
3	Do some physical activities that will help, if there is no gym in the area do street workouts 
3	is that not what social media is for? 
3	DIY publicity stunt? I usually make/buy a lot of things to alleviate boredom, but you seem to be more extroverted than me.\n\nMaybe put a table in the middle of town with a weird sign on it, like “Donate to the Eat an Ass Foundation” with a change jar on top.
3	BBQing outside \n\nnot only does it waste time but\n\nit puts it into good use
3	Shut the fuck up and go do something then. If you don't give a fuck what it is, then go do whatever the fuck you want? Thought provoking huh? 
0	Hold on, let me try something....	You’re ALL a bunch of Retarded Cunts.\n\nNow, I’ll watch the fireworks....
15	Doesn’t work like that
13	Ok
7	UwU why are you so tsundere ENTP kun\~
12	Faggot.
1	Whatever I'm sure you're shit at hockey while I knock down all the uncoordinated players 
8	How does an ESTPs thought process go?	Hey guys, INFP here according to the index. Since I'm supposed to be the 'polar opposite' to you I'm really interested in how you would "see the world". See I constantly have this ongoing monologue in my head, like me talking to myself, kind of shutting out the external world to an extent. I would guess this is different  with someone who is a) extroverted and b) sensory over intuitive.I really believe in trying to learn something from those people different from yourself. I frequently get lost in my head and ignore my surroundings due to all these interesting ideas and scenarios I make up for myself. My questions to you: Do you ever get lost in thought in the same way that say someone like me? Do you tend to think in pictures or in words? And if you don't think in words do you think it's because your thought process runs to fast for you to have this kind of "monologue" I experience?\n\nWould be really interesting to get some insight in how you guys would see the world differently. Probably a good way to dismantle any stereotypes there might be too. Appreciate any answers!
16	If i get lost in thought, it’s just me going over things I have to do, things that happened during the day, or I’m piecing together how things work. If I want to relax or sleep, I have to force myself to daydream and imagine.  \n\nRandom but an example that happened today of a thought I had: “does the amount of muscle mass you have help women deliver a child?” *googles it briefly and skims the title of two articles for conclusion*\n\nIf I don’t find an answer in 2 minutes, I’m distracted and move onto my next thought or action. \n\nI don’t always think in words as much, maybe more in memories? Is that considered pictures idk? I do agree that the thought process and logical understanding is too fast/complex for a monologue explanation. No clue if this made sense hope it helped. 
5	thought processes tend to be at extreme ends of one another.  \n\n\nI go over possible events, at its best outcome and at its worst outcome and then mentally prepare for the both of them.  \n\n\nI get "lost in thought" but not in its typical sense, i won't just sit and think. More than likely, ill be moving while I think, doing everyday activities.   \n\n\nI think in both words and pictures, but words being of discussion/monologue with others. If I talk to myself, its a few words and then I get on with whatever I was doing.   \n\n\nAs to learning from other people, I don't seek out to learn from others, it just happens.  \n\n\nhope this helps\n\n&#x200B;
3	The way I handle a problem is to first stay calm and determine what the problem is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen measure the problem to see if it's big or small as this will determine in the "HOW" will I solve it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo if it's a small one, then I just go ahead and tackle it. Mainly through trial and error until the problem is solved. Learn as I go style.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it's a big one, then I might look for the advice of other people who have experienced a similar issue, or I will do further research on my own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce I feel confident with a solution, then I will go ahead and apply it and then pray 13 hail Marys that it will work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it doesn't work out, then I just try to think on what could have gone wrong and how can I do better next time ? Then try again with the new wisdom acquired.\n\n&#x200B;
2	I think very visually. It’s why I’m an engineer. Been thinking about getting into paragliding recently so it’s been lots of imagining me launching the chute and gliding around etc. 
1	I overthink tiny/somewhat insignificant things, like crushes, questions in exams (the question will be 1 + x = 8, x = ____ and I’ll be sitting there for 10 mins being like, this must be a trick question, it can’t be that easy etc.)\n\nPictures > words (I do like reading, but for learning purposes pictures)\n\nLooking at a ton of words just bores me/I can’t concentrate, like you expect me to read that whole page about secondary cartilaginous joints? No, not happening\n\nBut for the most part, I don’t really think, I just go go go (for most things, not huge life changing choices). 
3	How to help chronically depressed ESTP mom?	Hi my mom usually comes out as INFJ on tests but she fits the profile more of a depressed ESTP (possibly ESTJ) than a healthy INFJ. \nShe's been in the dumps for so long that I think she's gotten used to it. Anyway, she doesn't show any desire to get better. I'm tired of it. Is there anything I can do help her? I've tried being nice, being firm, ignoring her, being a shoulder to cry on, etc but nothing has any results. \n\nEdit: She's been like this for over a decade. She might have tried therapy but gave it up for whatever reason. I think it'd still be a good idea. So what can I do to push her in that direction? Like I said, it's become her new "normal" so she doesn't have any desire to change it. I'm an INTP.\n
6	What do estps think of infps?	
13	Idk what they are
10	I've found they're lowkey judgemental which I dislike.
6	Appreciate their creativity & authenticity, dislike how subjective they can be, and I don't understand why they can be so private.  I am usually drawn to them anyways.
5	It’s fun at first. They’re quiet, reserved, emotional people I want to understand and connect with. Romantically, much harder to be compatible. They can be awesome friends, very loyal. 
3	my nephew is an estp and im his infp aunt i freaking love that kid. Its all fun banter, making fun of shows, my parenta, depression jokes he kills me. He can be insensitive but he has the best intentions, just looking for a laugh. We both like to observe in our own ways but find humor in the same things.\n\n My family has to watch what we say around him because he is literally always listening for new information. Wish I knew more estps you are funny mofos, not all infps are cry babies i promise ya. try it out. 
2	not interested
2	I would assume they were receptive audiences and playmates who would go along with what I wanted to do or talk about because it was important to me, which I may then be inadvertently ignoring their needs. I also see leading them on that our playful, easy-going relationship is a sign of a deeper connection that would not actually exist.
2	My bestie at work is an infp. I consider us activity partners. We usually go to lunch together, go hiking, paint or go to condoms events like seem interesting. Our curiosity keeps our friendship strong and exciting. We are both weird, spontaneous (seen as impulsive to others) and love textbooks and spreadsheets. \n\nI like how yall double check our actions because we're always in 'go mode' whereas yall are more indecisive and more reserved. This helps me take a moment's pause and really think about do I really want to do it.
1	Ah one of my closest friends is an INFP! They're very relaxed and makes for a great opposites attract type of friendship. 
1	Not very highly
1	Boring people who avoid the truth. 
7	Confidence without Arrogance	What's the secret?
14	IMO confidence is knowing you can do it, arrogance has a side of snubbing others because they can't.  \n\nSoo, don't be a dick?
10	Just be ourselves. Our brand of cockiness may be overwhelming to some but can be sexy as hell; and I don’t think it’s the nasty kind of arrogance. 
7	If you mean how do you do it without having people trying to shun you for it, you can't. There will always be people who just dislike you, for the silliest of reasons, but you just have to know yourself and know that your intentions are good. It's ok to feel good about yourself and the things you've worked hard to accomplish. The way I justify my confidence without being egotistical is by trying to be selfless and helping out others that are on the same trade as I am.  
6	Confidence is trust in yourself and your capabilities, to know your strength *and* your limits.\n\nArrogance is when you lie to yourself ie. I already know everything.
3	lol I just accept my confidence. Better than having low-confidence! 
2	I'm definitely the most confident person I know. I feel like I can usually avoid coming across as arrogant- just be nice
1	1/8th of your brain missing.\n\nMost ESTPs pick that part of their brain out from the nose that prohibits them from having confidence with arrogance.
15	Do any of you have repressed rage?	As a kid I just wanted to destroy.  I didn't want to hurt anybody, but I wanted to destroy for a good reason.  Like when you see a rule that is just absolutely nonsensical and restricting people, you want to light it on fire.  I had all this rage, but being put into a monotonous static institution of absorbing information, I couldn't do anything with it so I ended up being very destructive.  Just hurting people, being a bully.  I eventually repressed this, because I felt like a garbage human being, and I became very timid (although still very angry in random periods).  Now, I'm older, and its all coming back.  I shoved it under the carpet, but its not gone.  The other night I was blackout intoxicated on various substances, and absolutely went into an outburst, screaming and threatening my friend, and then I started crying.  It doesn't make me a bad person, it was just misdirected.  It has to be channelled into something helpful, something action oriented, and then it can become more beneficial.  I still don't know how to overcome the self hate that resulted from this misdirected rage though.\n\nHas anybody else gone through this rage?  Whether you repressed it or not?  What helped you?
5	Ohhhhh, yeah. I deal with this big time. I was a goody two shoes kid so I never really learned that I could be loved even when I was a prick kid - and with the issues I had, I had a lot of anger that I never let out. Now it's resurfaced via all my sadness being replaced with anger. Instead of crying, I get so angry I shake and punch walls. I'd kill myself before I ever hurt someone else though. I'd feel horrible.\n\nI can't give you any advice, but you're not alone in it man.
2	Nah I'm chill
1	> and then I started crying\n\nsure you're not an ESFP?
35	ESTPs rule! Some love from an INFJ	ESTPs are great, you guys have this presence that demands attention, its stunning.  \nYou guys are able to hear me out, letting my take my time to formulate my ideas, and aren't shy to tell me when Im wrong, and Im ready to do the same!  \nYou guys are brave and are quick at making friends and getting shit done.\n\nWhen you guys get emotional Im ready to lend an ear, which I like doing. Its funny how you guys can be a stone wall to some people and then be so soft on the inside. And when I get emotional you guys help me clear my head. \n\nYou guys share life with others, and that sharing makes it better for everyone, my fav part about you guys.  \nI feel like I can relax around you guys and recharge, when ya'll are not dragging me into some awesome adventure. \n\nYou guys are beautiful, strong and amazing people.   \nSo go out there and get it! <3  \n\n\nLove from an INFJ  \n
10	Aww thanks \nI have an INFJ friend and I would say the same thing back. I would definitely say he is the missing puzzle piece to me. Although we are vastly different from each other, we somehow mesh together in what we view of the world and others, and have similar senses of humor that we don’t need to be so PC about.\nSomething about him is immensely calming. Yeah, he does help me get emotionally grounded and he is very dependable and trustworthy. I don’t have many friends like that to be honest. INFJs are like golden apples you guys are awesome
2	Thank you for sharing, needed to heard that ❤
7	Danny Duncan....the ultimate ESTP?	As a ENTP, i laugh my ass off watching this guy and im always thinking,"This hass to be the perfect example of an PURE  ESTP".  \n\nIf you have no clue who this guy is look at one minute of his videos and it will be quite clear.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKJdVZs5PS8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKJdVZs5PS8)
5	Hell yeah dude that guy is ESTP extreme that even I can’t do some things he does 
4	INFJ here. I can see the Fe and Ti in him, and...\n\n“I’m more of a planner, but I take things day by day, might as well just do it once”\n\nYou most certainly do not have to do something once- Yeah, sounds like my opposite 
5	doing things for the fuck of it = estp for sure.
3	Yeah hahah. ESTP female here. Everything he said is prob something I would've said. 
3	The guy who went to every Walmart to buy a snickers each? Yeeah, I agree
2	I hang out with Danny all the time in Florida.\nThe dude is the perfect ETSP of you think about it\n\nHere’s a video when he first introduced his mini horse to me 😂😂\nhttps://youtu.be/4f8EzAiqAwU

13	Did anybody else go through a stage of analysis paralysis?	When I was a kid, I was always trying out new things, but I didn't handle failure very well.  After a whole lotta failure, I decided "Well, I'm just going to expect to fail at everything, because then I can't be disappointed."  This basically put me into a state of paralysis, uselessness, caused by the Ni grip (fear of failure).  Even my INFJ best friend was trying to get me to do shit, which is sad because I was always the one trying to get HIM to do stuff.  Eventually, I understood that this is a terrible mindset, because that negative expectation poorly affects your performance in the moment.  I'm still learning to confront failure though...\n\nDid anybody else go through this stage / are in this stage?
6	Im currently going through it now. Know what you're saying. Pretty dark and fucked up. \n\nWhat triggered it for  me Is similar to what Jordan Peterson is talking about in this video. \n\nThe analysis paralysis was triggered by something similar to this. \nhttps://youtu.be/sVNu9Wz3PgM.

2	 I’m in it now, in regards to finding a full time job post graduation. What keeps me going is knowing I can change my mind and any decision I make will be relatively as good as the second or third. The important part is to make a decision rather than be stuck in the analysis. Cheers 
1	Didn't realise this is a stage. Any hints on how to get out of it? I've had this mentality since I was a teenager.
5	Estp Jealous?	Hello there! \nWell.. I was wondering how ESTPs usually do when they.. get jealous. I have a friend estp and we are actually like.. flirting. But a few days ago something happened and after that he started acting weird.. i mean, lilke more distant. I think he got jealous but I would like to know first how do they act and also.. what can i do...
6	As an STP I usually try to rationalize the situation, THEN distance myself from the person if it is still causing me to feel bad. 
3	Hard feat to do tbh\n\nVery seldom does jealousy kick in if at all
2	If you stare long enough into the eyes of a Estp, they can speak morse code with their blinks 
2	Interesting question.\n\nTo answer to you, in my case, when i feel jealous i hate that ! For the good reason that i feel dependant.\n\nSo like others i get some distance, even if it's my friend (i speak of loving jealousy).\n\nI would like to have an other solution, but for the moment, i don't have an other one
1	Ask the person\nthink of what youve done\nget their opinion\nresolve the problem \n
1	I never really get jealous
4	What do estps normally think of mental health issues?	I confided in an estp teacher of my depression and anxiety and he seemed nice but idk what he thought. 
8	Be more specific. 
6	I think this is more dependant of who you're talking with. I think an ESTP can be a very fierce defendant of mental health as long as he has come in contact with it. Maybe he has had it himself, or he has lost someone close to him who had it.\n\nBut I don't think we are the type who naturally feels sympathy for mental health issues because they're very personal and it's something that can be tough to process for our often empiricist minds.\n\nHowever, he's your teacher and I honestly have no doubts that he's genuinely concerned and interested in the mental health of his students.
4	[deleted]
3	This is more of an opinionated question rather than something an entire type would decide
2	Specifically for your case, I don’t think you’re judged. 
2	I don’t really get it, and don’t expect much sympathy from me either.  If you’re my friend I’ll try and help you up until the point it starts negatively impacting my life then I’d leave you on your own until you become less shitty.
2	Depends entirely on where they’ve been. If they have experience being around or being mentally ill people, they care a lot. If not, then they won’t be as defensive
1	Personally I do have a problem since I don't like to seem vulnerable at all so I stay silent about it.
12	A message for people struggling with anxiety/depression/mental health.	Hey guys,\n\nIt’s me. A random person on the internet. Ik it’s rather strange that I’m just here, sharing my story.\nI know this probably wont be viewed- like ever- but I decided to share anyways. \nI would like to warn you, I’m not that great with feelings. Ive spent years understanding myself and I’d like to say i have some decent emotional intelligence, and I apologize if this isn’t very warm.\n\nI suppose its easier to do on the internet anyways, I don’t know any of you all and I will probably never meet any of you. But i want any of you that are struggling with mental health to know that I may not know your situation, or whats in ur head, but I get you. In some ways at least I’m sure we have a little common ground.\n\nI know you probably think that its just me already all better but I’m NOT all better. I’m still struggling, I’m still having my lows. In fact, I’m going through a tough low today.\n\nI started to struggle with depression and anxiety about three years ago. It’s not uncommon, as an INTP, to not know that this strange thing you are going through is in fact depression. Everything was just kind of-meh. I became even more anxious than i used to and I’d be terrified of speaking to half the people I met. My grades started slipping and I lost control. \n\nThis escalated throughout the past few years. Last year, I remember going to an apartment that a relative owned on the 17th floor, and almost jumping. They had one of those shorter railings where with a little jump I could have gone over. I don’t say this to scare you, but to explain my situation. Now here is some background. I grew up with two incredibly conservative Asian parents, one of which was abusive.  Today, I’m still scared of a lot of men with large builds but I’m recovering. Last year was definitely the worst. I remember wanting to cry, but being unable to let anything out. I was even urged to drink away my problems. Almost every day I wanted to do it, and every time i felt like i was better, the low would hit me twenty times harder. It felt completely hopeless, I felt like life wasn’t worth the pain.\n\nSummer was strange for me, i forced myself to read and I felt as if i recovered, but it was still there, haunting me. This year was a bunch of ups and lows. Ive always felt that even if i try my very best, in this condition, I still couldn’t succeed. Depression destroyed my ability to focus in class(even though that wasnt too great to begin with) and drained my energy drastically. I couldn’t sleep at night ever, and then I’d end up waking up at noon, something I never used to do. I rarely got more than 4 hours asleep and I would often fall asleep in class. My memory also failed, i used to have a really incredible memory where I could remember everything but that was gone, and its still gone for me.\n\nI had built up a facade, a protective method to not let myself appear vulnerable. In some classes I’d be so crazy and immature I’d act like a madman. Sure pissed off a lot of people. It was like some crazy ESFJ me(i am an intp tho) and it was exhausting. I’d barely be able to stay awake and after it would happen i would regret everything. \n\n A talk from a family member actually helped a little. I realized I needed to get my life under my own control and plan for the days that would be the most terrible of my life. I still remember what he said “if in a month, 15 of the days will be bad days, you need to make the good days count twice as much to make up for it.” Thats what i began to do. I did my work a few days ahead on my good days so that I had a cushion to fall on for the bad. I still have lows, but I’m working on wanting to get better. I know it sounds crazy, but really think about it. Sometimes whats stopping us from getting better is that we started to define with depression. We were used to living with it. Without it, we don’t know who we really are. I get that its not the same for everyone, but Ive heard things like this from a lot of people.\n\nAnother reddit post also kind of woke me up. It talked about three main things. Forgiving yourself, acceptance, and every day being a nonzero day. I currently cant find that post, but i thought it was important. I realized that just thinking about all my failures made it all worse. I had to accept that it happened and keep going. It’s a never ending loop and Ive been working to crawl my way out of it. Here i am now, still in a low, but now I feel like I have something to fight for, an opportunity. I think I’ve kind of accepted that i cant work at my full potential currently, but I sure will try my best on my good days, because they are all I have of this stage of my life.\n\nIve kind of learned to stop listening to the pressures of my parents because they only get me into more lows. I had to WANT this for myself. I don’t know if I do but I do want a future.\n\nI guess i want to see something ahead of me. But I’m also scared. What if I don’t succeed? I guess the future is so unpredictable and I truly hope that I’ll be okay. I’m not saying my method will work for you guys. EVery one of you has a different situation and your problems are all equally important. Maybe I posted this story for myself, I’m not sure. Maybe it was for closure. I sure left out a lot. I don’t know if I had the words to really explain it in more detail. That was just an idea of who I am i suppose. But, I do want to let you guys know that I am here. I understand those feelings, when your ears are pounding and you are nauseous and the room is spinning in a panic attack. I know those nights where you either cry a river or you cant cry because you feel so upset in a low and you want it all to end. I get the feeling of how scary it is when you think that the person you value the most could be leaving you, and its all your fault. I still feel this today.\n\nAll this is a part of my own daily life, and Its still an uphill struggle. But while I’m climbing this mountain, i can slowly see the summit. I know this may all sound meaningless to you guys. I get it. That was me, and it is still me sometimes. The only thing I can say is that even if the future is blurry and you think you know you’ll fail, you have nothing to lose when fighting. I know its hard to believe and even harder to start. I just wish i told myself this a lot earlier and I could have fulfilled opportunities that I wasted. If you ever want to talk to me, I’m here to listen. I;m not good with feelings but in this generation, I feel like we need to get our stories out and understand the importance of mental health. It is an illness, just like the flu.\n\nI don’t really have a conclusion, to be honest. I guess ill just end it here. This is my story, and I really hope that by telling this I could help even just one person, even if it is in a tiny way. Goodbye guys and Ill answer any questions you have. (Also, you may see this post on other Reddit’s) 
8	Estp parents and parenting	For those of you that had estp parents how was it and for those of you that are parents how are you at it?
5	INTP with ESTP father.  I would have preferred to read, study and watch TV, but he works hard and plays hard. So I got a lot of exposure to the outside, mowing, raking, woodworking, fixing cars and snowmobiles, hiking, cross country skiing, unicycle, camping, playing an instrument, choir and travel. My older brother got a microscope, telescope, a train set and a chemistry set(note all this was 50 years ago, we didn't have much money but somethings he got us anyway).\n\nAs a introvert I would like to avoid many social settings, but if there was a social gathering, we were there, and he was talking to everyone.\n\nOverall, very helpful having all those experiences, which I might not have had otherwise.
4	I've read that ESTPs are the fun parents. Like, kids generally love hanging out with them and have fun, and feel loved but not suffocated. I feel like I am this parent. I also substitute teach, and the kids the tell me often how I'm fun but we also learn a lot.\n\nMy dad was an ISTJ/ESTJ. He was strict and I hated him for a long time. My mom was a INFP-ish? 
1	I hope I’m a parent one day. Raising a small version of me would be so sweet. 
17	The desire for a simple life	IDK if you guys agree but a coworker (ISTP) and I (ESTP) were talking about what kind of life we wanted in the future. \n\nWe ended up both agreeing on the premise of a simple life. House is paid, all debts paid off, retire early and leave work forever. Spend remaining time/money doing hobbies, hang with friends/family, and vacation/traveling from time to time.\n\nWe both agreed that being too rich and famous was stressful (people suing you, getting kidnapped for ransom, potentially losing it all, etc.) and being too poor was as stressful for obvious reasons. \n\nOn the contrary, with some NTs I talked to, their life goal seemed quite extravagant. Either they want to be the first X to be on Y (ex with ENTJ wanting to make it to Forbes 30 under 30), or something along the lines of being the “best” of their respective field of interest. The simple life seems to scare them for some reason. IDK why, but only a few NTs seemed to agree with us (not a bad thing) whereas the sensor friends I have, all agree on having it as stress free as possible. If we could claim fame for what we do, we can, but it’s not like an important thing to us. Perhaps the best term is that NTs need to “innovate” something in their life to feel accomplished. I know a few that don’t care about that, again, just saying what I find common amongst my coworkers and friends, and if you guys relate or something.\n\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nWhat kind of life do you guys want in the future and why? Also state ur mbti type if you’re not ESTP (I see you INTJs).\n\nType stuff if you relate to title
9	Amen. 
9	Yeah. I want to bust my balls doing high risk, high reward stuff when I'm young and make a nice nest egg, then go settle into a job I like. No kids, just go do what I want to do with my life (which is largely travel) and get into expensive hobbies for grown up children.
5	I'm an ESTP and I want a simple life aswell but at the same time, I believe this would make us boring people since we have no goals
4	all i want is a simple life in a farm where i can truly live my life 
4	 ENTJ here. I would like to be lead our first quest to establish a self sustainable colony on Mars. (Wishful thinking) 
3	I'd like a life of no obligations like you. Plenty of money, not having to work for someone. Having time for fun, friends, alone time, time to pursue my own interests, learning, exploring and growing as a person. I think this relates to maslows hierarchey of human needs.\nhttps://goo.gl/images/mDAP49\n
3	INFJ Male\nSame here, the simple life. The sounds of nature to fall asleep to, a garden to cultivate, all the hobbies and reading im interested in, traveling, hiking. I want to build a life towards that. First step would be to find a female ESTP to build our lives, but I have yet to meet one IRL. DM
2	I agree. I’m INTJ and I want to be the best at what I do. If I wanted to travel somewhere, if I wanted to relax, then I would make that my short-term goal, but time is a limited resource. If I relax for too long, my mind is always gonna think,”what’s next?” If every day is not stressful and there’s nothing to work towards, I might as well die next week. 
2	A relatively-nice townhome in a low-COL city. I’m into cars so I want to get a sporty car like a Volkswagen GTI and have fun with that. Try to find a girl to share the rest of my life with and take it from there.
2	Infp here and same.
2	Kind of. I want to be some über-rich John McAfee/Nicolas Cage-type person and then spend the rest of my life as a human prank, spreading chaos wherever I go with elaborate practical jokes (like putting stacks of money on the streets as a bread crumb trail) and random appearances in public (showing up at a Dollar Store somewhere). Like Martin Shkreli, but not a complete pile of shit
1	I want to be famous haha. I definitely like a few spontaneous stuff and drama and if I'm rich I'll get to buy a few cars, bungee jump and skydive (young ESTP)
11	Past Lovers	How did you guys deal with people you had developed feelings for, but for one reason or another couldn't make it work at the time but never lost those feelings? Did you force yourself to move on and find greener pastures or find a way to overcome the roadblocks in your way? 
5	Basically realizing why I felt the way I did, where it went wrong, and if it was even avoidable or not\n\nI then tried to better myself and not look back. I guess the emotional baggage for me has kinda dropped off because I'm a completely different person in nearly every aspect of my life. \n\nI know the same thing wouldn't happen again today unless it let it. Other things could happen but I know I have bettered myself in one way for sure.\n\nTldr: Basically tackle your insecurities and you won't feel insecure 
3	I’ve had that sometimes. It sucks, but I tend to look at it as a benefit because if it would work out and I never realized something that didn’t, then we would be fighting and that’s not good.\n\nI know relationships aren’t perfect and yeah I can still have feelings for those that didn’t work out, but I just suck it up and say I will find someone better someday that will really “get me” and be open with.\n\nTo numb the sadness, at night I just drink a lot, blast some sad songs on my earphones (November rain by Guns n Roses) and eat some comfort food and then sleep and hang out with friends the next day. 
1	They all formed in high school. We all moved to different places for university and to settle down so for me there was just no point in trying to make something of any of those crushes. This is probably a more apathetic response than some of the others you may get, but I still very much think of them when I stumble upon one of their posts on social media.

10	Star Wars vs Lord of the Rings	Hey everyone. \n\nWhich do you prefer?
11	I don't think there is a comparison. They are both equally epic.
8	LOTR. Just because of the sheer epicness of the Mumakill vs Rohan scene
8	Star Wars specifically the EU version. I really dislike the new Disney canon 
6	Lord of the Rings. The babes are better
7	Star Wars\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLOTR movies are very lengthy, and not much action happens besides maybe a couple of scenes within that 3-4 hour time stretch. Star Wars has great music, great sound effects, action scenes, good story, and shifts between different characters' plots here and there to keep it interesting. Also, Han Solo shoots first.
5	Star Wars
5	Star Wars
3	Star Wars
4	Star Wars. I honestly find it difficult to sit through the LOTR films. There are so many holes where very little is happening, and that's where I lose interest. 
4	 Star Wars
3	LOTR. The chase scene to the river in the first movie is one which is guaranteed to give me goosebumps every time I watch it.
11	ESTP and politics	Just a random thought, do you guys have an interest in politics and where do most of you lean politically?\nI'm a politics (and philosophy) student and on the libertarian-right/ small state conservative. \n
15	Fuck SJW's that's all I have to say
8	Definitely center right and I hate PC culture. 
6	Yeah, it wasn’t until junior year of high school that I became interested in political news. After a lot of digging and diving, freshman year of college I finally decided that I’m libertarian-right as well. Very cool question. Hope the thread grows.
11	WOOO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI found a lot of fellow ESTPs voted Trump 2016 elections. We had a HUGE party at NYC, it was fucking amazing I tell ya.\n\nSerious answer: I'm a conservative, but with some libertarian values.
4	Used to care about politics until I realized how it’s so obvious they manipulate people and how easy people fall for it.\n\nStill interested in policy though... so my interests are more in geopolitics/economic policy/diplomacy etc... the government sucks 
5	I don't really care about politics, and I'm a centrist
4	Politics is all rigged. I’m fiscally conservative and mostly hold libertarian when it comes to most other things. 
3	I'm a centrist. 
3	Did my Bachelor's in IR. Would say I'm neorealist or something of the sort without a clear right or left inclination.
3	No interest. I’m a liberal. 
3	I got interested in politics after the 2016 election.  Political science is part of my double major now. I’m populist left/social democrat. Basically, a platform of ending the wars in Iraq/Afghanistan + our drone program, stop selling weapons to Israel & Saudi Arabia, end corporate welfare to wal-mart, Exxon Mobil, and “defense” contractors, properly regulate and tax Wall Street, end the drug war, ban private/for-profit prisons and legalize marijuana, reinstate net neutrality, Medicare for all, end the electoral college (1 person = 1 vote), start a paper ballot initiative, fix the dirty water in Flint + other cities, do a green/renewable energy infrastructure deal, and raise the minimum wage.
3	Just found out I'm ESTP today, been interested in politics since I saw the newspaper headline "WAR!" ( GWB Sr's gulf war). Been following it ever since. Thought I was liberal, then found out I was actually conservative, by the time I was 17. ( I had 'em backwards)
2	Reasonably interested, and lean libertarian (well more like liberal, but in the UK sense not the US). I'd be interested to know why ESTPs tend to be like that. I've also noticed that we tend to be quite independent minded or third party, as opposed to very committed to one side or the other.
2	Right wing Liberal (cut them taxes) what a suprise
2	People think I don’t have political leanings since I’m technically a centrist, but I do have very strong, yet contradictory, leanings, and by sheer statistical probability, I go straight down the middle. Took that political test and ended up as a liberal, though.
2	I come from a very conservative background, and as such, I have conservative views.\n\nBut I don't care enough to actually do anything about it. After graduating college, I realized that I don't care about politics enough to even vote.
3	Anarchist but I realize it's not realistic with a society this developed so I don't really care. 
1	Very interessed in politics. Even considered becoming a politician. Would say that I’m a centrist, but left-leaning
5	Friend ESTP - Ni Grip	Alright guys, a sweet ENFP is here asking for a lil of help (okay, let's keep down the ego. This is serious for me).\nI actually have an ESTP classmate. We've been like... 2 years together at the same class. Those years we didn't talk much due to some stuff (well he actually flirted with me and the things didn't go too well, it's a long story haha), but as we were going to enter to the same career at the same college, we did team work for exams and studied together and we actually have a good .. friendship? Well, for me it's not really a friendship as we don't talk about deep stuff, but we have fun together so well.\n\nOkay, that was to describe a bit my relationship with him. Now I'll explain the situation.\n\nAt first, he was happy about college, motivated u know, but as the days kept passing.. that motivation started to dissapear (there have been already two parties and he refused to go wtf?!?!?). Apart from that, he is starting to get angry easily.. and he is becoming more serious...\nI'm quite worry about him, as I'm seeing he is going into a Ni grip and.. I don't know what to do, i mean, I wanna help him! But i don't know how to do it.. \nHe isn't socializing much with people, it's like if his expectation weren't becoming real? I dunno..\n\nI dunno how to act in these situations with him ;--; so I was wondering if you guys could help me out?
7	IDK looks like to me this ESTP is having some frustration that he doesn't want to tell you.\n\nI said this to someone with a similar problem, but if an ESTP really wants your  help they will tell you. From what your post looks like, is that you haven't told him how much you care about him so he doesn't know about it. He is deep in thought about this problem he has, that he doesn't want to talk to people because it bothers him and he's trying to find ways in his head to get rid of it (the problem).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess one way to make him open up is to say\n\n"Hey I noticed that you are losing motivation, not going to parties anymore, acting all serious... is something wrong?"\n\nif he shrugs it off, then it's a personal/deep problem he's been struggling with for some time. In that case I'd say\n\n"Even though I haven't said it directly, I really care about you and want to help you. I was with you when \[insert good time with ESTP\] and think you are \[insert positive characteristic\]. If you want to talk to me about your problems, I'm here."\n\nEither this ESTP will\n\na) Break down and vent all his frustrations to you in some private area\n\nb) Walk away... then come back to you after some time and tell you everything if he trusts you.\n\nESTPs in Ni grip will always want to be secluded until they figure out the solution internally. But they also know that they can benefit by bouncing off (to people they trust) about their frustrations and how to solve them. It is therapeutic to an ESTP like me, to talk to someone and realize that someone is there that cares for me and that I'm not alone in case things go out of hand. They need to feel ready about it first, so it takes some time.

2	I thought you were going to complain about him not studying. Some people are just introverts and the party scene just really isn't their element. You never want to pressure people into doing anything because you feel like you're doing them a favor, but they may also feel they're doing you a favor if they go out of their way to go and if things go south you guys may end up resenting eachother. If you guys can coexist knowing that you have different interests that might be the best route. Keep inviting them of coarse, so that he doesn't feel excluded, but don't be pushy.
1	I think I understand what your friend is going through. Since you only use your secondary function in times of stress (Ti), this adjustment might be extremely stressful for him, especially because he's used to the dynamic life before college that he had a lot of control over, his motivation might be turned into more media consumption/things that stimulate his mind while he processes this new change(using his Ti). \n\nHe might be more apt to spending time by himself because of this. It appears perfectly healthy for me. I have a tendency to be a bit shy as an extrovert so when I move somewhere new it can be a huge adjustment for me because it takes time to build the big friend groups I want to be around. 
8	Easiest way to determine if someone is ESTP	They love Red Hot Chili Peppers
14	Oh shit I’m being called out
3	Used to like them when I was younger. Not a fan of them now 
3	If you meant red got chili peppers, as in spicy food, then you got me.\n\nIDK about the band though, their music is alright but it's not that intense enough for me. \n\nMy favorite bands are Sum 41, REO Speedwagon, and \[anything Eurobeat here\].\n\nGunsNRoses when I'm sad.
7	Can't stand RHCP
2	How did you come up with this? Been only listening to them and Johnny Cash for like 3 years straight.
1	ENTP dropping by. I like them. Flea is a god. But I like other bands more.
12	Dating advice?	I (26F) have recently started online dating this past year and I must say it’s been...interesting. I haven’t been in a serious relationship by choice due to work, school, spending time with my friends, and doing some self discovery. I’m at the point in my life now where Im open to the possibility of a relationship. \n\nIf I’m talking to someone that’s sparked my interest, I am sooo into them-thinking about them through out the day, wondering if they’re thinking of me, have butterflies when they text me something cute, etc and then the moment I find something that I don’t like about them (example: repeated attempts to bend my already established boundaries) or that something may seem “off” (possessive or controlling characteristics surface) I first asses myself and see if it’s something I may be doing, that’s causing these negative feelings/thoughts toward someone. When I realize that it’s not me (which isn’t always the case.. I can be a bit blunt or matter of fact and that gets me in trouble sometimes), I am perfectly fine with just not seeing/talking  to them again. It’s like a switch that goes off-it’s really weird I can’t explain it. It could take me a couple dates in to realize this about said person of interest. When explaining my dating life with my best friend who is an ESFP, she doesn’t understand how I can “cut someone off” lol. It’s hard for her to process or even fathom letting someone go so quickly after having a lot of feelings for them. She can tolerate a fair amount of b/s and I just don’t have the patience for it. \n\nOn another note-I can lose interest fairly quickly in someone also. It’s the same thing, I could be totally into them or be invested in their life and then I kinda get bored and just let things fizzle out. Eh yikes right? Has anyone else experienced this? Or does anyone have any advice? 
3	This happens to me a lot. However, I'm not nearly as eloquent as you. I'll be brief. \nI always put open communication on the table immediately. It ensures that my partner knows I'm earnest. Then, I make sure to reenforce the traits I like with sincere compliments. If my partner and I split after getting close... It's cold turkey. They will usually understand because I've told them I only do things with honesty and openness. Continuing to talk would feel cheap. They usually know that too. 
3	There's always going to be some form of bs, unless the red flags a huge red flags if you're cutting people out of your life for petty things, and are absolutely ok with it there may be a different underlying probelm. likeing someone to the point where you obsess over them might be the problem to begin with because you start painting them a certain way when you haven't given yourself a chance to get to know them, so you mislead yourself on who the person really is and become weirded out or dissapointed when the persons veers from what you initially thought. Also I've learned sometimes some of our biggest flaws don't go away you just have to awknowledge them and try out other strategies. The people you're talking to might get the initial feelings that you're putting out, maybe they don't know how to deal with it either. Also I've been in situations where my ex at first really wanted attention and would get upset if she didn't get a certain amount of it and once I thought I got how much attention she liked, she'd flip it and ask me why I'm clingy. Which I'm not, but seeing that she somewhat groomed me into giving her a certain amount of attention It became natural until it wasn't. If certain problems are repetitive I'd definitely take the time to reflect if you may have aided in certain behaviors. It's really hard to give advice online because I don't really know you so all I can give you is a bunch of different situations that you might want to consider, that being said I hope I brought a different perspective to your situation.
1	Yeah I experience it quite often. I find me and my other xSTP friends have issues with relationships. It's different with guys I'm sure but a lot of girls don't like when I basically tell them they are crossing my boundaries, don't respect my boundaries, and a lot of them don't wanna communicate their issues with me and beat around the bush when I ask what's up or communicate my issues with the potential relationship. I get pretty blunt at times with them too which don't help when you're dating a more sensitive person but ignoring it will only cause issues in the future when you do start being blunt so it's best to be blunt from the start Imo otherwise you'll get the "you've changed I can't do this anymore" thing. Then again I also tend to date crazy girls so that may have something to do with it. Also when you cut them off do you just ghost them or do you straight up tell them you don't think it's gonna work? 
13	What happens when an ESTP doesn't socialize?	So I'm on the bench of rather I'm an istp in their WTF years or an ESTP who's stuck in a Ni grip. There's good reasons I think I'd fit in either one but I think I'm more of an ESTP whos in a Ni grip or even a neglected Se functioning. I don't wanna get all into it so if someone could just explain what would happen if an ESTP neglected their dominant functioning that'd be great.
14	We can tolerate a few days of not talking a lot to people, like weekends where we want to just chillax on our own. But then we start getting bored easily and want to talk to people and hang out places. This is where the bad stuff comes in.\n\nIt's the same as if you force an ESTP to stay in the house all day. We get angsty and want to start doing things to appease our Se. Whether that means running up and down the stairs, eating something, pacing, playing multiplayer games online with voice chat, etc., we need to be doing SOMETHING with ourselves/others or else we start getting easily irritable and annoyed. We might get into angry bursts of frustration, because "something/someone" is holding us back from being able to do what we want to do. We might start getting depressed too. Honestly, we just feel like a dog with their leash stuck to a pole outside. We see a lot of interesting things out there, but we are somewhat held back by an invisible force that causes us to get angry when someone comes near us and tries to mess up our mood even more. Mind you, this is after long periods of not being able to socialize. We start hating people around us and we become easy to anger. We get all argumentative and might even contemplate suicide because we don't find enjoyment in our lives. We start getting philosophical and all that.\n\n Until this "invisible force" is gone, we are able to call our own shots, and we have chilled out after the frustration of prolonged isolation, that we become ourselves.

3	They turn into an ENTP...
3	Lol honestly you sound JUST like one of my (extroverted) Estp friends. Just gonna throw that out there.\n\nOh and ISTPs find action scenarios engaging, but usually have a calm and quiet demeanor when engaging in them. Think Jason Statham in the Transporter series
1	In the most abstract way I can put it: [This video](https://youtu.be/T2DqAFeoqdk)\n\nThe spool represents my brain, the chain represents my happiness/tranquility, and the hole represents lack of social contact
8	Stubbornness and willingness to make mistakes	Any ESTPs relate?\n\nIt's like when people tell us specifically NOT to do something (Don't miss a day of class! Don't put your hand on the mouse trap! Don't try to swim in canals!), it's like it's holding us back from actually knowing why we shouldn't do it? \n\nIt almost gives us a rush to go against what people tell us not to do. And when we do it, (and we survive), we say it's not so bad... or if it does backfire hard, we accept/respect the rule and never do it again.  We do know there are absolutely stupid things that you cannot do, but there are things that we think is possible to do, so we see if we can do it.\n\nLike, I enjoy pushing the boundaries of what I'm told not to do, and when I do push the boundaries I  actually learn more than someone simply shaking their finger at me and saying "No".\n\nThis behavior seems to help us for future things, like assessing levels of risk, also giving us endurance and an optimistic attitude.\n\n&#x200B;
3	Yes. And if you want me to not do stuff, better just tell me that I have to do it. 
2	This is me all over. \n\nPeople want to keep you down. Most of the time when people say it’s for your own good, they mean it’s for their own good. 
2	For me it's also funny seeing them freak out over little things that don't matter. Like jumping over a wall, teachers yell and scream at me because "I could get hurt!" When it's not even ten feet off the ground\n\nPeople need to chill out sometimes lol
6	ESTP Cognitive functions and four sides of the mind EXPLAINED	
2	What are your thoughts?\n\n&#x200B;
2	I agree with his take on extraverted sensing, you see this clearly in ESFPs who want to be the life of the party and give people good experiences. This is because of their dominant Se function. Thank-you for sharing this, im going to be looking at more of his videos
28	ESTPs and knowing how “the system” works	I feel like I figure out how “the system” works really quickly in a situation, which lets me get away with so much shit. Combine that with good persuasion and I can get out of almost every problem. Anybody relate? I feel like ESTPs look really reckless and overconfident because we know exactly how much we can get away with.
17	Yeah same.\n\nI wanted to know what the point of going to school for \~22 years, getting a job, retire, and all this BS I was being forced to do. Then the system all looked like a game to me, with all these rules, who wins and who loses, etc. Eventually realizing that you really don't have to play, or you can decide to play and bend the rules to your favor, which makes life all the more interesting.\n\nQuoting this from a song, but I relate a lot:\n\n"And it seems like a waste of time. If that's what it's all about. Good luck movin' up because I'm movin' out."\n\nI feel like other ESTPs just get this. They don't like being boxed in by the "system" so they strive to see what the whole point of it is and how it works, then they observe what works for them and just do it. This is sort of why we get overconfident with things, because we *expect* things to play out like it should, but life doesn't work that way all the time. I guess this can also explain why we are optimists, because we see how rules can easily be manipulated as well as people, and that we can also change ourselves for the better by looking over what troubles us. Observing people being so caught up by things in "the system" seems like a joke almost, because we know there is more to life than what you are expected by everyone else to do.
14	Yeah I kinda know what you mean \n\nHonestly just remain calm and not rude and you can pretty much get out of anything \n\nSometimes you need to take a small hit to pull off the biggest heists. Some people can't/won't take that hit
8	Relate. And the less time we are given, the more competitive edge I think we have over others in getting out of a situation.
5	Recklessly overconfident - I've literally been called this by a friend. But then again, it usually works out so I don't have to "learn my lesson".
4	I'd even say those of us with a less dominant presence would be victims of bullying from others who think of us as assholes by just being ourselves and can get alienated by others rather easily. Thank god for Aux Ti and tert Fe.
8	How extroverted are you guys?	It's often said that Se-doms are the most extroverted extroverts, and I want to know if this holds true for any of you. Also, does anyone here consider themselves introverts or leaning more on the introverted side of things?
33	If you met me in real life you'd probably think I was some INTP or something. I'm very introverted in real life because there are a lot of people I don't bother to talk to, unless they strike my interest or I need something from them. I can be the loudest person in the room if I'm comfortable, but usually I'm not because I like to get the feeling about the people around me first and adjust accordingly. 
5	I'm an introvert who's good with people. Definitely not extroverted, that's why I often doubt that I might be an ISTP. But all descriptions of ESTP just always seem to fit more for me than ISTP.\n\nSo either I'm either an extroverted ISTP or an introverted ESTP. All I know is that I definitely have Fe in 3rd place and Ni in 4th. Still not certain whether I'm a Ti dom or an Se dom.\n\nI've seen quite a few people who are also struggling with deciding if they're ISTP or ESTP. 
5	Not every ESTP is so extraverted some of us are ambiverted
4	Probably not the most extroverted guy out there; more like being much less shy when it comes to doing stuff most other people would be shy to do 
4	I’m quiet until someone gives me a reason and opportunity to talk. My ISFP friend summed it up best once in a conversation:\n\n“He’s good at starting talking”\n\nISFP: “…and doesn’t stop”
2	💯 
2	Y’all are so cute 😊
1	I’m in the middle. Slightly on the extroverted side. So it comes out a lot at work or socially but then I’ll disappear for a while. 
8	I have a 13yo ESTP son with ADD.	Hi everyone,\nMy husband (INTP) and I (ENFP) have a 13yo son. He also has a 19yo sister (INTJ) and 17yo brother (ENTJ). Recently he was diagnosed with ADD and tested gifted/talented in some areas. Made total sense :)\n\nHe’s wonderful in a thousand ways... but also fiercely logical and independent. He’ll become an awesome adult one day.\n\nI’d like some advice from this group because my ENFP ways are so foreign to his. Even his father finds him a challenge. There’s a lot of love/warmth in this home, but there’s always room for more connection.\n\nI adore him but need advice on how to connect with him in ways that make school, family, meds, life more meaningful for him.\n\nHe’s more than your average teen... and I’m glad!\n\n(I still get a hug and a smile... when I ask.)\n\nTL;DR How do we all show love/connection to our ESTP son/brother in a way that makes sense to him?
10	Just some thoughts. ESTPs are the type to be most likely misdiagnosed with ADD and ADHD. I’m not saying he was misdiagnosed, but it’s definitely something to be aware of. Everyone thought I had ADHD when I was younger. I too am a ESTP and was a “gifted” student. ESTPs are really good at finding solutions to problems without digging as deep as say an INTP would. Once they have a general sense for the problem and a potential solution, they tend to get bored and move on to the next. This, along with their P tendency to wake up and “take on the day” without a pre-planned schedule like their J counterparts, can make them appear really scattered. \n\nWhether or not he truly has ADD, I think that our personality type really starts to flourish when our brain matures. It becomes easier to recognize the downfalls of an ESTP and give more focus to one task at a time. Your son is still really young, and he’s probably fascinated by his mind’s ability to find quick but surface-level solutions to problems and then immediately jump to new problems. Let him explore his mind. And maybe start to challenge him on certain topics where he believes he’s found the solution, but hasn’t yet considered points A, B, or C. Since he’s still young, he’ll likely get frustrated by these deep dives but I can guarantee it will be one of the best things you can do for his developing mind. \n\nAlso, if you are able to successfully do this, he’ll develop an incredible sense of respect for you. He probably won’t show it now, but when he’s older he’ll look back and truly appreciate your ability to challenge him and help him grow.
3	Mmmmh, interesting question. \n\nI think that it could be good if u get interested in his activities. Ask him questions, try it maybe. We love a lot to speak about what we love and do.\n\nAlso, make him feel that he can talk of anything with you. \nFor example, with my parents we never speak about sex, drugs or anything like that.\n\nSo be direct with him, tell him that if he got any problems or want to talk of anything (say the tabou words like drugs sex), he doesnt have to hesitate.\nBut don't force him. He just have to know that u're here in case of need.\nAlso, but i think u already do that, and it's not only with ESTP, don't judge him on what he does.\nU can tell him what u would do, what he had to do, but don't judge.\nBe in reflection with him. And explain ur decisions if u punish him. We hate illogic things. \n\nIdk if it will help you, because idk how I was when I was 13 and idk ur son, but I think it would have worked with me 
4	I'm an ESTP guy with an ENFP sister. We're definitely completely opposite in terms of character and especially how we make important decisions in life. \n\n  \nAll I remember from when I was 13, was that I didn't really want anything from my parents. I just wanted them to stay the hell out of my life. As you said, we're fiercely independent. My sister and I both had a lot of friends and we were both sociable, but unlike her, I did not have the need to talk to my parents about my life. I did not feel the need to "connect" with them. And even today, I still talk a lot less to them about myself to my parents than she does. \n\n  \nI guess just being there for him is all you can do, and I wouldn't be too worried about connecting. Just make sure he stays on the right path during his puberty and if he's a good guy, and I'm sure he is, when he starts to mature, he'll also start appreciating you more.  \n\n\nI think it's typical for ENFPs to feel the need to connect to people, but for us ESTPs that's really not a must, not even with our own parents. \n\n&#x200B;
2	Support him in his sports/activities
2	Ok, I also am an ESTP with ADHD. (15)\n\nLove for me is when someone is interested in what I'm saying, does things my interest and is genuinely worried when something happened to me and caring. I don't put much value in I love you's if that the thing I hear.\n\nIf someone supports my art that's huge for me.

6	How can I make an ESTP happy?	Hey guys, ISFP here. Simple question. How can I make an ESTP happy and fulfilled, and get on their good side? 
32	- Be direct about everthing, no hiddin agendas\n- take them on adventures, or go along when they want to go\n- Dont try to “limit” their freedom. \n- Dont overcomplicate things and problems, for them its “just what it is”.\n\nENTP female with ESTP boyfriend. 
5	Also, we have inferior Ni so we are sometimes prone to fear of the future, or assuming the worst case. We'll rarely say that openly (unless you're very close), so sometimes telling us things will be fine is good. Or better yet, encouraging us to do things we don't want to do, so we stop thinking about what might happen, and start seeing what actually happens.
3	Something I've noticed that my ENFP friend does whenever I'm feeling down, which always works, is taking me somewhere. Be it the park, a museum, the mall, a friend's place, a restaurant, you name it!  Any experience always cheers me up. Especially if it's something completely new to me. But this is more if the ESTP is already unhappy.\n\nSome tips for keeping them happy and content.\n- Try not to shoot down the ESTP's every idea/take part in their impulsive desires every now and then/indulge in their hobbies with them.\n- Say what's on your mind, instead of beating around the bush. If they ask you if you're upset, then don't say "No" if you are, in fact, upset.\n- Ask them for help with a problem. Nothing is more exciting than trying to think of new and effective solutions.\n- Don't expect them to talk feelings all the time, as this can be very uncomfortable and draining for most ESTPs.\n- Accept them for who they are. ESTPs are generally very tolerant and not very likely to judge you, and prefers the same treatment. They might give you shit about some things, but it's really just banter. Deep down they don't care.
2	You don't get or make us do anything, it either will or it won't. If they see it in you, you're off to the races 
2	Ask them if they could explain you something, then listen attentively and follow their advice. Also challenge them from time to time to be better at things than they currently are.
2	Upvote my comment lol
11	The rush of a good chase .	How many of you are addicted to the rush of chasing things like a goal or even while riding / driving or basically to get something you want badly like matters related to  passion or purpose especially when it gets difficult.\n\n
7	That is one of the things that make me tick. I think it's also one of the things that define ESTP's.\nI feel kinda lost after I've achieved something I wanted really bad
4	Spends hours looking for a great deal. Minutes after buying it. Wait a minute I didn't need this.
3	Got cut off by another car on the highway. No dude you deserve the same thing. Chased and cut him off. It's now all cool.
2	🙋🏽‍♀️
1	I mean yeah, that's why I get out of bed in the morning.
1	Yes I relate to this.\n\nI don't know why, but even the act of physically driving, taking the bus, train, or walking to the places I need to go to helps me feel happier and more accomplished in life.\n\nI feel even more accomplished if I get there myself, albeit faster than the rest. It sort of becomes a mini accomplishment of mines to brag about. 
11	Outgrowing friends quickly.	Any of you find yourself outgrowing your friends/ people quickly and find them boring after learning something from them and  move on. 
10	Most people I meet are normies and normies are inherently boring.
6	I found this especially true to my multitude of friends I had in highschool. After college, they become a completely different person and I no longer become friends with them. It's only the friends that really share the same characteristics, that I am still friends with.
1	Reading this and just realized how many friends I used to be so close and now so disconnected. This is quite true. 
1	Change is normal it’s for the b-est. you don’t love the same things we loved in preschool, same favorite foods , same favorite activities. we all change it’s just the friends that stayed the same that we leave behind , the friends that don’t develop with us, can’t hangout because they’re in the same shitty jobs. Those are the ones we leave behind.
1	Finding my old group to be a bunch of sjw who I have to dance around so I dont offend them. 
13	[Edgy] Do you guys find people predictable?	Edgy opinion, but I do tend to find people predictable. I also hear fellow ESTPs can relate to this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMBTI just makes it easier as a tool. But in general, I tend to only need to observe someone for an hour or maybe even first impressions, and I already get the gist of what the person is and what would best suit their needs. I can easily change my "face" to suit their personality, so I have no problems making friends with almost anyone. Sometimes it just comes off so easily to me, that I find it a game and I would provoke certain people for the fun of it (and to confirm my aspects of similar people I already subconsciously know about).\n\nFor example, I tend to troll others just to confirm what I know will fire back at me, also for fun too. I just find it entertaining to confirm how I predict people will react a certain way or something.\n\nIt becomes some kind of practice. **Super edgy**, but just listen a bit... every butthurt comment I get (in response to troll threads I post), I keep an aspect of that personality in my collection of how I can act with these specific people and almost blend in to suit them. \n\n**TL;DR Example:** \n\n1. Post meat in vegan forum\n2. Vegans get mad and start spouting their opinions \n3. Somehow take in their opinions, observe their profile pictures, their usernames, the way they form their text, and create my own "vegan advocate" persona.\n4. Become nearly indistinguishable from the average vegan whenever I want to\n\nType stuff if you relate fam
12	Yes, it’s quite easy for me to be as uncharacteristically professional or as ghetto as I want in order to blend in with a certain crowd. What’s still difficult is to stick to the way I really want to be. 
8	Yes, people are often very predictable. But they are equally unpredictable. For every ten guys who ignore your troll there will be one who responds. So I wouldn't become too arrogant. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, trolling is a big waste of time. The internet does not equal real life, you don't actually learn anything on the internet in terms of other peoples' character.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the internet it's way easier to insult people or to get dragged into a useless argument. That's why there are so many trollers and trolled people. In real life they'll probably just ignore you because it's more tiresome to get into a discussion IRL, and more confrontational.\n\nInstead of trolling on line you could give people sincere compliments in real life. That way you're doing the same thing but you're actually doing something useful for yourself and others!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;
4	I too find it easy to determine a persons personality in a short period of time. My issue is trying to not project my own thought process/morality on to that person. I’m often let down thinking others respect personal space (public transportation),  conversation (talking too long about nothing and or themselves), simple manners the way I do. I suppose that’s a personal issue but wonder if being able to predict people’s behavior, you also allow yourself to be let down by complete strangers. 
3	I completely relate with you on this. I’ve personally found that people generally fit into archetypes and I think it’s our instinct for people that allows us to adapt and somewhat turn into a mirror for personalities. I like to think that it’s has to do with ESTPs refusing to fit into these molds that make us see personalities at a higher level.
3	Obviously if you go to a vegan site people are going to act like vegans on that vegan site\n\nJust like if you went to a church people will put on a "Church" face. (Depending on the church of course)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problem is trying to break through that "face" and finding out what a person really cares about/is like in other areas of life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSomebody at school may hate school and look depressed all the time but outside of school are a total blast to hang out with... just one example there.
2	I think most mentally stable people are predictable, we have ours ways and we like them\n\n\nThat being said, I agree and do it too
2	Yes, PnssyDestroyer. I have no idea how, but as an INFJ you really just described me very well. I do the same thing to people. Everyone has a collection of traits that they show. These traits are observable and understood. You recognize what groups they fall into. Everyone, in my head, is a combination of different archetypes. These archetypes are not really something that exist in the outside world (like "geek" or "jock"), but they're arbitrary ones I have in my head. I do it unconsciously, and then when someone talks for a while, or tells me enough about them, I can pretty much place the rest of their personality. I know this seems arrogant, but I'm usually actually right. Some people can get mad when you do this, but I think they're more upset that you can read them really well and that they aren't as unique as they originally thought. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's not my fault that, left to their own devices, people do tend to center around the same couple of ideas. A lot of it has to do with mass culture and hive minded tendencies. People surround themselves with those that they agree with, and never really strive to change their opinions, so they end up acting the same and it makes my job so much easier. That's why I'm careful to not subscribe to any particular faction, ideology, or group too heavily. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also am a massive troll, and am somehow very edgy for an INFJ. I can go in threads and piss people off with my opinions and make it 100% believable. I could be a flat-earther or might even convince others that I'm an extreme vegan and pose some ridiculous political ideology that runs parallel to the holocaust for meat-eaters / fur wearers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's why I'm always attracted towards extremely weird or unordinary people. I can't type them down and need more info about them. 
1	I do agree with you.\nBut it's more like "i know if he will bore me" and generally i need like less than one minute to know that.\nAnd if they bore me, it's easy to know how they are.\nPeople are often predictible.\n\n It's pretty boring

7	I have no idea what to do in life advice?	So i have been taking some test and i’m \ndefinitely. The problem is that i hate school soooo much. I want to do stuff and not sit on a chair the whole day. I’m in my last year of my degree but i hate everyday of it. Advice? Really know idea of a career choice. \n
8	Shit sucks but ESTPs can get through all kinda shit and make it through the other side. I thought about dropping out but my degree was probably one of the best things I got. Just gotta take each day as it comes and realise you only get one go so dont fuck it up. Sooner you get it out the way the sooner you can go and fuck around in Thailand or somth.
4	Business / Sports. But to have a job in sales you need to follow a education. But i think you don’t learn the business stuff in school. All the great entrepreneurs say that all the time (elon musk, gary vaynerchuck) the list goes on.  
3	You'll need to give some more context if you want people to give you some valuable help.\n\nHow old are you?What are your ambitions in life?Do you want to go to university?What are your interests?Are you intelligent?\n\nWhere do you live?\n\nAre you able to discipline yourself?How much do you want to work?\n\nAre you good with people?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want to make a good career choice, you'll have to know yourself first. Not knowing what you want to do is not a problem if you're young. 
2	What are your interests?
2	So I'm an ESTP and I've done school on the side of what I've been doing for about the last ten years. I'll talk about that first and then talk about career stuff, maybe some of it will helpful. \n\nWhat works for me is to cheat. I can only do things that I think are fun and that I can figure out how to market - so I try to turn it into a game and figure out exactly what about each thing I'm doing is valuable and marketable. Then I create a situation in which it's way more costly for me to get bored and give up so I have to finish it. I came from being super poor so I find that forcing myself to pay it out of pocket makes me so mad at how expensive it all is (in the US) that I have to finish it out of spite for all the rich brats.\n\nFor life, I dunno man - beats me. I'm 27 and I'm on my third career - and I got HERE by flipping a coin. Before this, I had 22 different odd jobs, according to some stuff I had to recently fill out. I've lived in three countries and seven different states, some multiple times, in the last ten years. I'm doing pretty well for myself, I spend money on whatever is fun at the time and I do whatever I want. I think the key is just to never worry too much about planning but to always pick things that add value to your background that are fun. If it looks good that you did it, it's easy to bounce back when you get bored. Military is a double edged sword but if you play it right, you can have a new job every year. Physical things are more stimulating for me, but those are tough to find in the civilian world, so sometimes the best I've found is mechanical things that I can do with my hands like working with cars or computers (or language, depending on how you look at it).
21	?? How do you talk to NTs ??	Ello \n\nSo is it just me or is it that there is some disconnect when I talk to NTs? It's like they are in a different world and I can feel they are perceiving us through a different lense which I don't understand.\n\nLike for example, trying to break the ice with NTs, I try to randomly think of big ideas like (What would happen if scientists use the DNA of a mammoth and put it in a female elephant will it work??) and they get all flabbergastic about this and start talking. \n\nI personally find the idea interesting, but it's not something I would enjoy talking about consistently. Where as, NTs, can talk about it forever / go on long tangents, which pisses me off internally after a certain time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only NTs which I can realistically tolerate for lengthy periods of conversations are **ENTJ**s. Perhaps because I can pitch them some great ideas which have a connection to reality, and they give me great suggestions on how to work it and if it will be successful, and sometimes they become interested and want to work with me. I enjoy conversations that I can end up applying afterwards, which seems to mesh well with ENTJs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI struggle talking to types such as **INTJ/INTP** and **ENTP**s. With ENTPs, I have to think about some LOL RANDOM XD unrealistic idea or show them a politically incorrect meme to get them talking and then end up debating with which give me a headache because I don't caaaareee. INTJs seem like an enigma to me and they either come off as rude and standoffish (ignore any attempts to make conversation), or become critical/give favor about what I talk about and then not talk anything even though it was like 1 sentence long. INTPs are just far out there and start going down the rabbit hole of what I just talked about towards different ideas which is a headache and I have to stop them from talking too much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR-**\n\nSo how do you talk with NTs? How do you not get a headache with them? \n\nIt's like every time I talk with an NT, I ALWAYS have to give them something interesting. I can't do some small talk like normal people do because some get completely turned off by that and I want to be friends with them. Thanks guys.
21	NT's? Sorry just answering based off your headline, you offer them Pizza, they love pizza. No offense if you're a Ninja Turtle and you don't.
20	INTJ here...I think the easiest way to talk to an INTJ is to minimise your expectations of a response, and prepare yourself for some intense silences. It doesn't mean we don't like you, but yes we're judging you. Don't take it personally, and it's more a cool detached kind of judging to see if we'll invest time in you. We do that with everything! If I'm going to invest time in (read: have a conversation with) you, I think I respond most to authenticity, genuineness, and intelligence.
17	If someone is that far out there in terms of me connecting with them, I just...don’t bother. \n\nMy best friend is ENTP and I know a few NTJ’s. Got no problem connecting as they usually have awesome senses of humor. \n\nMaybe you’re overthinking things. 
13	As an INTJ I couldn’t make any friends with any type other than INTPs ISFPs INTJs ENTPs INFPs never met an ENTJ or INFJ, didn’t like ENFP/ENFJs, and one ESFJ friend that I don’t think he is an ESFJ...\n\nI don’t talk much with anyone other than INTPs i love them they are great.\n\nTo be fair idk if i met all S’ types but most of my friends (before knowing about MBTI) turned out to be NT’s. \n\n(I don’t choose friends based on MBTI thats stupid, i just find a person that i like and start talking to him/ her.)
13	INTJ here. I have a good(?) friend who is ESTP and we get along great...in certain circumstances. My issue with her - apart from seeing her increasingly as _very_ opportunistic (that in itself is troublesome b/c we appreciate genuine, loyal friends) - is that I find her equal parts exhausting and boring. Exhausting b/c she _never_ stops doing: “LET’S GET BREAKFAST”, then “LET’S GO TO THE POOL”, then “LET’S GO SHOPPING”, then “LET’S HAVE A BBQ” and all in the same day sort of thing. Now, that could all be fine, _but_ as you’re doing all of these things, she _cannot_ have a meaningful convo about anything - has literally said “Why do we have to talk about these things, LET’S TALK ABOUT BOYS”. So, you’re exhausted from socializing, but bored to death with absolutely no mental stimulation. We (or at least, I) like to talk about ideas or what’s going on in our life/world and how it _relates_ to other people/things. Make a connection with what they’re talking about and don’t try too hard - have fun with the conversation/them - as another ESTP said, we often do have a great sense of humor. But, we can also sniff out a disingenuous person from a mile away. 
11	Small talk doesn't address **any** of my wants or values. Small talk is a means to an end, making enough trust, cohesion, or familiarity to get something done, not a goal in and of itself. Pulling myself out of my thoughts to communicate with others is effort, and effort requires a payout. \n\n> give me a headache because I don't caaaareee.\n\nWhy would I want to participate in a conversation you don't care about? Do you think I care?! Conversation is effort, if neither of us care why would I put in effort? This is what I believe you are getting from INTJs.\n\nI would (and do) just talk broadly about things you are passionate about, if you both care enough about similar things maybe a good conversation will be had, if not then you will not have a good conversation.
11	>*I personally find the idea interesting, but it's not something I would enjoy talking about consistently.* \n\nINTP here. Chances are the INTP you're talking to feels the same way about the idea, but is continuing on the train of thought because *you* seemed interested in it & they know firsthand what it's like to be interested in something wacky but not have anyone to talk to about it. The rabbit trails are inherent to the type, but *communicating them to you* is the INTP's attempt to reciprocate in the conversation. (Plus it's rare for an INTP to come across someone willing to have those kinds of conversations, so they're going to grab that bull by the horns and not let go if they can help it.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*NTs, can talk about it forever / go on long tangents, which pisses me off internally after a certain time.*  \n>  \n>*With ENTPs, I have to... end up debating with which give me a headache because I don't caaaareee.*  \n>  \n>*INTJs... either \[ignore any attempts to make conversation\], or become critical/give favor about what I talk about and then not talk....*  \n>  \n>*INTPs are just far out there and... I have to stop them from talking too much.*\n\nI totally get how a person can feel like this, but\n\n>*I want to be friends with them.*\n\n...do you **really**?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mean, I'm sorry--that probably came off as harsh. It's just that after reading that, my understanding is that it seems less like you want **to develop meaningful friendships** with these specific people, and more like you want **to be the sort of person who's friendly** with all sorts of people.\n\nAnd that's fine, but it means that regardless of the topics you bring up, *you're still ultimately engaging in small talk.*\n\nI think that's probably the biggest contributing factor in the disconnect you're feeling. You're engaging these types in a "small talk" manner, but with all the trappings of "**not-**small-talk." So in a way it's like you fooled them into thinking this wasn't going to just be chitchat. But it ends up backfiring on you, because they took your engagement at face value and wore you out.\n\nSo to circle back to your original question/topic, **how do you talk to NTs?** Deeply, or not at all (generally speaking).
9	INTJ - usually not much talk, just hang with them and do stuff \nINTP - ask them to copy their homework, or sometimes exam \nENTJ - give them aesthetics advice and receive financial advices in return \nENTP - exchange sarcastic/dark jokes and laugh our heads off 
9	If I understand some of the cognitive functions correctly (I'm very new to MBTI and very old to you), here is the problem, as I am seeing it.\n\nYou think in a linear fashion. \n\nThe Intuitives and we are a minority,  think laterally.\n\nCombine that with a Ni's inherent Breadth of Curiosity and your own innate Trait Curiosity ( I do not know if you have breadth of curiosity and mean no insult)\n\nhowever, this makes communication difficult for both of us, when we want to communicate.
7	I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n- [/r/intj] [A post on r\/estp on how to talk to NTs I found pretty interesting](https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/9mxxf6/a_post_on_restp_on_how_to_talk_to_nts_i_found/)\n\n&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
7	As an INTJ, this would piss me off. It feels like you are more interested in me as a collector's item for your group of friends than an actual person. I wouldn't want to just be the awkward token friend. 
6	>With ENTPs, I have to think about some LOL RANDOM XD unrealistic idea or show them a politically incorrect meme to get them talking and then end up debating with which give me a headache because I don't caaaareee. INTJs seem like an enigma to me and they either come off as rude and standoffish (ignore any attempts to make conversation), or become critical/give favor about what I talk about and then not talk anything even though it was like 1 sentence long. INTPs are just far out there and start going down the rabbit hole of what I just talked about towards different ideas which is a headache and I have to stop them from talking too much.  \n  \nBest descriptions I've ever read 👍  \n  \nIn general acting like their own type or the complete letter-opposite (ENTP->ISFJ) gives the best results. Focus on Ne or Si for the ENTP, Fe or Ti for the INTP etc. I just don't know if you could keep that up for too long.
3	That's totally true.. I already got some friends NT's and sometimes they put attention to whatever i say. \n\nWhen i going to meeting them i read a lot of thing just to have something that sound interesting to them cuz they already know what i going to talk about and they going to be bored so faster. 
3	Two of my best friends are intp (my room mate)  and entp.\nI have any problem to communicate with them.\nI'm maybe less in their World, but they are very interesting and very funny.\nI'm never bored with them.\n\nBtw, yes they dont like smalltalks when they are useless.\nBut i dont especially talk about that too
1	(INTJ here). The only thing I have in common with ESTP's is that we both like to party.
1	>  INTPs are just far out there and start going down the rabbit hole of what I just talked about towards different ideas which is a headache and I have to stop them from talking too much. \n\nWell, I could totally see this happening but usually, INTPs who are socially somewhat adjusted could definitely see that you're not interested in their abstract theories and they would know that most people wouldn't be interested in such things so they won't really talk about it if you didn't bring up that topic.\n\nI have xSTP friends that I am close with and I know that they are not interested in my abstract theories. When I am with them I talk about ideas that are more applicable to real life and generally my experiences and we communicate through Ti so it's fairly easier to relate.\n\nIt's not like I hate conversations about real life stuff that is concrete but I do prefer abstract convos about ideas and theories. AND I also do realize that I can't do that with most of the population so I adjusted myself to it. Therefore, it is good on your part to talk about abstract stuff with INTPs from time to time but you don't really have to force yourself to do so all the time just for the sake of opening up a conversation. :)
5	I created a subreddit for MBTI Music stuff .... share your playlists !	I think ESTPs have awesome music selections. Me and my ESTP friends can just spend time listening to music all day and have a blast topping each other ! I guess there are more of us techno snobs, closet indie heads out there.\n\nI find it notoriously difficult to find ESTP musicians ! My most recent find was [Slaves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmtU-bLyReU) and needlessly to say the replay button was raped. \n\n[The Who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN5zw04WxCc), [Pearl Jam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MS91knuzoOA) band heads seem ESTP to me ! It's a difficult type but I would say [John Peel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Peel) is good example of the Promoter archetype usually assigned to ESTPs.\n\nFeel free to post whatever here -> https://www.reddit.com/r/MBTIRadioStation/ <- \n\n\n\n 
1	Slaves are fucking awesome bro
16	Do you feel like people are intimidated by you?	For example, at work, sometimes my colleagues are surprised I make jokes with them or partake in their banter, but they always seem really positive about the fact that I do. Then one day, I might not feel like being very social and generally keep to myself or try to initiate conversations. The differences in how I behave I think makes people a bit unsure about how to behave around me.
10	I've been told on more than one occasion that I am aggressive when all I've ever done is talk to them, lol. sometimes people are just pussies, and thats not my problem. \n\nI'll admit I'm pretty full on and I do enjoy putting pressure on people just to see how they react, but really its all just good fun, at the end of it all I dont really care all that much.
9	This exactly. I can sense it as my colleagues are silently baffled by the unexpected change in my demeanor. It’s also quite funny when some of them start to go off on a tangent and ask me random questions presumably to evaluate whether I’m mad at them or something. 
5	Yes, I supposed that's what people feel when they don't act normally around me sometimes. \n\nI tend to have the persona to outsiders as just a quiet and peaceful person that doens't talk much unless interested/told to. When I randomly express my strong opinion on something, or tell a satirical/politically incorrect joke to a person I know can handle it, the people around me start acting all weird because they don't expect it, when in the inside I am the person I hide and only share on special occasions. \n\nI don't take this as being intimidated, but more of that the person is very unpredictable and hiding lots of things which give into unsureness and intrigue. 
4	I definitely square up to people I’m suspicious of. I’m a nice person, but sometimes I have to make sure people aren’t gonna do something behind my back (snitching, mainly)
2	I was one of the “leaders” in my friend group at church, in youth group and after I left the church and stopped talking to the majority of them (Love drama) they started acting differently and my friend there told me that they acted differently around me and are doing things now they wouldn’t ever do around me. So you’re definitely not the only one, and some of them were always trying to impress me or if I act weird/tired they’d think I’m mad at them. Trying to say that in the least cocky way as possible 
2	Yeah a lot of people are unsure about me as well for the same reason. I've asked several people why they acting differently after I start talking again and most of them say they thought they pissed me off or something like that. Im not sure if they are intimidated, afraid of confrontation, or just don't know how to effectively communicate with others but either way it's funny. 
19	Ever feel like a paradox or something?	Sorta like ENTPs (introverted extroverts)\n\nI tend to have a persona in real life that I show as quiet, chill, somewhat intellectual, and submissive. But if you knew me at home, I’m a fucking politically incorrect savage that likes going out and having fun.\n\nI don’t show my real self unless I’m comfortable around the people I’m with, so I get mistyped a lot. \n\nAnyone relate to the persona thing?
16	Yeah completely.. I feel like I come across as the most boring and basic person when you meet me but after I’m fully comfortable with someone I’m like super obnoxious LOL 
7	I think this is Fe in action. We know that you need to act tactfully around some people and can let the leash out on others. It takes time to suss out if people are into unPC jokes and stuff. 
5	Yes, I do relate. Not everybody gets to experience the kind of animal that defines me. 
4	Yess, I do really recognize myself in this! Thought I was weird for being like this, but there are many others :)
2	I guess everybody has a face that they put on when different situations arise. \n\nLike if somebody was threatening you with a knife, would you start shivering/express your emotions or try to remain calm?\n\nPutting on faces is a normal and logical thing to do... Maybe to an extent it can be bad though
2	I’m the opposite
1	I think a lot of people think that just because you're shy, then you aren't an extrovert. Which isn't true. 
7	Shadow and inferior fucntions manifesting in the estp .	For the ESTP (Se-Ti-Fe-Ni), the opposing function...\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/isfp/comments/9c3bet/how_do_your_cognitive_function_pairs_fite_seni/e57sbbi?utm_source=reddit-android
17	You're truly alone in the world	I'm a strong extrovert so I know what it feels like to be surrounded by people/ friends all day, but at the end of the day we can be reminded that we are truly alone in this world and that in it of can be a refreshing experience lol
10	But you merely adopted the dark; I was born in it, moulded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but BLINDING! The shadows betray you, because they belong to me - istp
2	So you ever have days alone?\nOr do you constantly have to be surrounded by people? - doesn’t that drain you? 
1	That sucks I hate that
14	Who do you despise in school?	So it's start of the fall semester, let's talk about the people we HATE to be with in school.\n\nMe\n\n1. Those kids who try soo hard on the first say to relate to the teacher and be friendly with them, like I get it, you want to be the teacher pet and/or get that letter of recommendation.\n2. Those kids who ask the teacher before class ends if there is any homework today.\n3. Kids who try to show off how much they "know" about the subject / correcting the teacher a lot.\n4. Kids who ask a lot of dumb / basic questions ~~that are common knowledge esp. for the upper level courses. I mean, how did you even get into this class if you didn't know X.~~ (I mean the kid who asks a lot of questions but don't bother to work the problem themselves kind)\n\n**You can also talk about teachers!!11**\n\nI dislike teachers who\n\n1. Are long winded in their speech and won't get to the point\n2. Don't let us actually do something with what we learned, until probably the very end of class\n3. Put a lot of excess/dumb rules and regulations to things that don't really matter (how the text on the paper should be formatted / what color ink we use / etc. ) with no good reason why\n4. Keep talking but it's not related to the subject at hand (unless it's funny and/or interesting k)\n\nType stuff of your own\n\nType stuff if you relate
7	This is topical since I'm sitting in lecture right now and this dude hasn't stopped talking since we fuckin got here, but his rambling stretch of the word lecture has zero structure. It's literally impossible to type any sort of notes on this, thankfully attendance isn't mandatory 
8	Fucking preps. Two-faced, passive-aggressive motherfuckers talking shit behind your back because they think you’re a dumbass for being too loose. I’m in the same classes as you, that’s probably a hint that I’m just as smart to the teachers
6	I'm out of school now (thank God), but hated strict discipline. Mainly because it destroyed my assertiveness for years after being bullied by a teacher.\n\nI also hated people who were overly cliquey, whether in the "I'm not talking to you because you're too popular" sense or "I'm not talking to you because you're not popular enough". The other thing was people being silent in class, people don't realise that if you don't answer the teacher still makes you answer but gets grouchier.
6	exactly the same...all these girls my best friend is friends with hate me cuz I’m “stupid” (not afraid to try a question and get it wrong/don’t spend my whole life dedicated to school) and every time I say something they try to challenge it while like angrily glaring at me, even when I’m right... 
5	Hated those smart kids whom when asked how to go about solving a difficult homework problem would start their sentence with “oh, this is a very simple one...”. Asked them anyway. 
3	 This perspective bother's me:\n\n"Kids who ask a lot of dumb / basic questions that are common knowledge esp. for the upper level courses. I mean, how did you even get into this class if you didn't know X."\n\nI've been in courses where I started out weak and ask dumb questions, hell I'm a guy who engaged in the teacher's lecture and was wrong, but in a learning environment you can't be self conscious and think about what other people are thinking about you. You have to look out for yourself and speak up if you're lost, what's annoying is if someone is lost week after week and they're clearly not looking for help outside of class. At the end of the day we go to school to learn. One of the best way's to learn is to test yourself, to make mistakes and learn from them. I've come back from having weak foundations in a class and starting poorly to finishing with a great grade  because I wasn't afraid to "ask dumb questions" (compared to what?) and I have been wrong plenty of times. School isn't a popularity contest (can be if you let it be) it's about learning, engaging in the material. If you meet cool people along the way it's great, but getting caught up in drama, gossip or belittling people that put in the effort is weak.  
2	Mostly people who write me off, then can't handle when I switch gears
2	Estp here, \n\n(Btw how do you get that cool thing by your name that shows your personality? Thx)\n\nUsed to be an istj when I wrote these things and even then I still hated school (high school) when apparently your supposed to like schedules/reliability.\n\nThis was during junior/sophomore year and I remember this one gripe/complaint over anything else, I'll leave a little excerpt here from my notes (no way I'm posting the whole file lol)\n\n\n"It's not that people back then knew more. In fact we have much more solid information then they ever did. It was more the rate that people were learning. "\n\n\nI always felt held back, was in honors classes, had good grades, never failed a class, great supportive parents and all that but could never learn anything interesting because somebody would hold back the class, sometimes it was me\n\nIt's just a flawed system. A whole class learning something instead of the individual \n\n"People back then" what did I mean by that? What was I talking about?\n\nPeople throughout history "grew up" at an EXTREMELY fast rate compared to today. It's why you become an adult at 18 in the U.S at least.\n\nA lot of people would stay in school for 16 years learning essential life skills (reading writing) and work in the field all day then get their own. My great grandfather even had his own house/wife at 16 \n\nIt wasn't the content, it was the rate. And our system is majorly flawed in that way (although I would prefer different content as well lol)\n\n\n\n
1	Everything.\n\nI like to do creative shit and I can't do anything.\n\nAlso there is this kid who notices everything and comments and assumptions immediately (same) but says it OUT LOUD.
1	I'm the student that could be a teachers pet but is a bit of a rebel and sometimes a disappointment, yet the teacher still roots for because I'm real and always do a great job (when I want to) because I tend to be a slacker, but not a trouble maker, but I do stir drama.\n\nIn fact, not having me in class can be a bit boring. Friends with everyone except the too goodie goodie ones, although they do like me too even though some would never admit. Hate the bullies but they do respect me. \n\nTLDR: Bart Simpson
3	Is he ESTP or ISTP? Or ST at all? [Help!]	He is super flirty, sporty and confident but that may be because he's really good looking. He tries to tease me every now and then but really cares for me, brought me food and water and offered it several times more.\n\nIt's really hard to say if he's an intro or extrovert. One time I played a little "mind" game. I got away from the crowd and went to an empty spot, not too far away but I was alone. He always came when he saw me and we would start talking about all kind of things. We did get really well along, even started to get into philosophical topics. Idk if this matter but he was surprised when he found out I was single. Perhaps he is quite impressed with me, I spontaneously agreed on hosting an event, showed him my artistic skills and I even beatboxed when the opportunity arrived. He also seemed to like my humor.\n\n​\n\n**But**\n\nHe has a girlfriend.\n\nI did not know this from the start, actually only on the last day I decided to meet him. I think I might have been reading into it too much.\n\nNow I just want to know what his personality Type is so I can find reasons why it would not have worked out for us anyways. I'm not sure how helpful the context above is going to be for typing him. One of my friends also said that he doesn't seem like the type of person to fall in love easily. Also, he has a Technician part time job while finishing his media marketing studies in uni. If that helps at all??  \n\n\nI'm an ENFP btw
2	ESFJ probably.\n\nESTPs are cool and free-spirited, not necessarily flirty and social. On the other hand, both STPs are bad romantic/friendship matches for an ENFP. ENFP's matches are ESFJ, ENTJ, INFJ, ISTJ.\n\nESFJ males are masculine but kind and social, sporty but not aggressive, and they are way more caring than ESTPs. If you are an ENFP, and if you are really into him, with the details you provided, he most probably is an ESFJ. 
4	city/suburbs/countryside	where do you live/work and which is your favourite place to be?
6	Live/work: city\nFav place to be: the coast
5	Grew up in the countryside, I love it and will do anything to go back\n\n\n\nI live in a small city that's very isolated, is very agricultural and country, and it's spread out so it feels very small as well, retains the small town feeling. I love it here\n\n\n\nEdit: not really into cities. Visiting is about all I'll do, where I'm at now is absolutely an exception
5	It has to be the city. Grew up in the city (though it was technically the suburbs due to weird city borders, it was half an hours walk from the city centre) and went to university there - I couldn't face living anywhere unless there was something new to do.
2	live: suburbs\n\nfavorite place: country OR city\n\nI like the country because of the farms and the fresh food and cool ass farmers markets. Also enough space for me to raise my fish and chickens and hang out with other farmers. Also not many assholes in the country. Con: Isolated, far drive to interesting areas, not much to see.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI like the city because I get to shop and visit cool and interesting places. I also get to meet with like-minded business men who are on the forefront of new technology or ventures. Con: traffic/assholes/crackheads
4	Where would I find ESTPs in real life?	This may be an obvious question but to an INFP like me it isn't lol. 
11	the ESTP store\n\n\nEverywhere that people in general are (obviously), but places you'd find us more likely around include but are not limited to:\n\n* any job or jobsite where you are physically involved/work with your hands\n\n* sporting events and/or the gym\n\n* activities that are dynamic in some form or fashion like outdoorsy things or music\n\n* social environments\n\n* business related venture\n\n* the military\n\netc
6	Try to hit the gym
6	Literally anywhere. ESTP is probably the single most versatile and adaptable type.
4	You'd also be surprised (given the stereotypes) as to how many you'll find in science and tech fields. It's not a huge proportion, but certainly more than the general population (thanks to Ti). So that could be another place to look.
3	Rarely will you find them in engineering. But boy when you do... you dun found yourself a gem. Just the way they bulldoze the awkward social settings, it brings me happiness. Wish there were more of my kind here
2	ESTPs are pilots and police officers, some are into adrenaline/dynamic activities, and also they are highly represented in math and engineering fields. In business they prefer project-type ventures. They can be master illusionists, musicians or artisans. They can also be found in the military, and in sports that are technical rather than only physical. 
2	My filmmaking class is full of ESTP's.
-2	On their knees in front of me.
3	Intjs	Just wondering what you guys think of intjs ? 
11	The 10' pole up their ass is a bit of a turn-off.
6	They are quite condescending and easily get butthurt about their own ideals. They like to think they are right and don't really like to change unless its in their best interests.
3	Sometimes it takes too much energy to babysit their ego. Otherwise, cool people to hang with. 
2	I love them 💕  ..I’ve been in a relationship with an INTJ for 10 years. He’s everything.
3	ESTP or nah?	Been told by ENTP's that I'm not one of them, so I'm wondering if you guys can relate to any of these points:\n\n*Highly aware of my surroundings, have quick reflexes\n\n*Love to show off, but never exaggerate\n\n*Set high standards for myself and those around me, hate mediocrity\n\n*Conflict-averse, but never kiss ass or hesitate to disagree with someone\n\n*Never been into sports or cared about winning in sports, otherwise pretty competitive\n\n*To the point, hate people who ramble, instead of saying exactly what they mean, see rambling as an intellectual weakness\n\n*Sentimental about things, not so much about people\n*Very hedonistic and into money\n\n*Love superficial social interaction, but otherwise quite secretive\n\n*Mostly form opinions on my own, without thinking out loud or needing someone else to bounce ideas off of\n\n*Wasn’t good at school, hated doing anything related to it. Sucked at math and chemistry, but knew languages better than anyone else\n\n*Understand languages more intuitively, having a gut feeling for what is suitable for a specific context\n\n*Been pursuing the same artistic career since 14(in my early 20’s now) and never had second thoughts about picking it\n\n*Like “fun” art and see most “serious”/“dramatic” art as pretentious and pseudointellectual, don't mind pop music or popular movies as long as they're not trying to shove morals down your throat\n\n*Love debating, but like winning them more than reaching a truth\n\n*Despite that I've grown tired of debating politics, religion and philosophy, see it as pointless and not satisfying, I'll debate the shit out of some other topics though\n\n*Optimistic
7	Quick glance at your post history. \n\n>Thank you! Since a kid I've always liked saying ridiculous things or acting dumb just to mess with people and see how they react. It's kinda true that I'm worried about shallow people, because I'm concerned with **authenticity** and **integrity**. Someone can tell me I suck or I'm good and I wouldn't care about it, but **if someone said I'm incompetent I'd probably be pissed.** I don't get emotional over criticism, **if I see that a person is competent I appreciate his opinion**, negative or positive.\n\n>I've always loved arguing with people, but it's always been more competitive with me, **I form opinions first and then challenge other people, instead of forming them in the process of discussing something.** But at the same time I don't argue about things I'm not confident about and like learning new things **from people.**\n\n>I did double-check my opinions all the time as a teenager, but I've gradually stopped doing that. I think I **used to overestimate the competence of other people** and over time I've realized that most opinions can't be trusted and started listening more to myself.\n\nYou have Fi and Te for sure.  Not ESTP.
5	Esfp
5	sounds pretty estp to me.
3	Could also be ISTP. Im one and I’m not socially awkward or that introverted. Cognitively I am an introvert. But test both. I just have social awareness. \n\nOh. Look into INTP too. 
5	Any good / ez jobs for ESTPs to apply to? ://	Hi guys PnssyDestroyer here.\n\nI'm literally dead inside from my office job (I'm a medical assistant) and it's extremely detail oriented / repetitive and pain staking. I can feel my brain cells melting from the stupidity of my job (literally any kid can do my job ngl). I get paid minimum wage to scan and input records and it's my third day and I already want to kms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you guys have any recommendations on easy jobs to apply to and get in? I'm still in community college so I don't have much in terms of degree. Any ways to make money or something? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks guys
4	Uber, rover, doordash. Those seem pretty easy to get and it’s a variety and lots of interacting with people/animals so you won’t get bored.
2	There's jobs and there's careers. Getting into the gig economy is something you can do for extra cash, but try to find something that has career potential. You'll thank yourself later. \n\nIt's good that you don't have a degree yet! Nothing is set in stone. If you still like the medical field, decent pay, and don't want to be in school for ages, something like sonography/ultrasound tech, radiology (more risky) or phlebotomy may be options for you to explore.\n\nFind something you enjoy and pays well. I technically tell people what to eat all day and love it. I chose nutrition as my major because the careers are diverse and there's always something new/contradictory/problems to solve. There's a bit of science, math, and psych/sociology which kept school interesting.  I could have been researcher or a blogger. I could work at a hospital (very routine), do cooking classes/be a personal shopper, become a professor, start my own business or create nutrition handouts/trainings.
2	My niece is a radiology technician. She sets her own hours (up to a point) and she loves it.\n\nThe hospital is pleasant, the cafeteria is good and the people are young and fun.\n\nr/https://www.asrt.org/main/careers/careers-in-radiologic-technology/explore-careers\n\nShe was in school for two years and if she finishes her bachelor's, the hospital system may offset her school costs.\n\nGood luck with your career search. It's fun to think about what I might have chosen at your age and with all of your options.
3	I was mistyped	[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g\_6qneilEeg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_6qneilEeg&t=2s)\n\nHere y'all go, some of you said I wasn't an ESTP, turns out you were right
3	Fuck I love being right. Even people who know me IRL still don’t understand most of the time I only open my mouth when I’m right. Or when I’m trolling, one of the two. 
2	lol i think youre an isfp/isfj hybrid no way a entp or estp.
3	Ni Eye movement	Has anyone tried to channel their inferior Ni by using Ni eye movement? Ni eye movement is basically the eyes oscillating between 2 points while what I can only assume is some idea that is on your mind. I've experimented with it by simply performing it during classes and such but eventually I just get tired or get eye strain, however, I've seen people like my uncle who is an Ni dom where he displays the eye movement so casually where it doesn't feel unnatural at all. Any thoughts?
7	No idea, sorry bud  
2	It's funny. Ni is my fifth or sixth function, so I don't know that I make the eye movements at all. I have tried to consciously make the movements. It doesn't do much for me beyond making it difficult to think. :) Before you feel the eye strain do you think that your cognition itself is impacted?
2	Yes! My dad and I are both Ni doms— we do this with our eyes when we are imagining. Not for accessing memory, but projecting and imagining. 
2	Do you know whicht two points? People (shortly) look in different directions depending on which part of their brain they access.  \n\nI can tell you though that moving your eyes won't help you use Ni.
2	idk I start staring into the distance when im occupied thinking about something
2	I recommend watching c s josephs YouTube channel for a better understanding of type and functions. Maybe its possible to «trigger» a function by a specific stimulus, but you are probably better off understanding how to gain knowledge from your different fjnctions/ sides of your mind. How to best utilize your functions, and in which mindset that is healthiest.Rather than thinking only in terms of one function at a time. -Ive spent a lot of years reading about Mbit but c s Joseph is actually the first that really goes in depth with personality types, in my opinion and in an understandable way.-fellow ESTP 
14	Accurate ESTP description by functions	Se dominant in ESTPs:\n\n> "As much as I can, I try to keep moving at all times. I have to be  involved in something exciting and I get bored easily if there's not  some kind of challenge to conquer or new area to explore and figure out.  When I see an opportunity to try something new, I tend to jump in with  both eyes open and just deal with whatever happens. I'm really good at  adjusting to whatever is going on around me--I know how to impress  people and I like it when I'm able to show off my skills and gain  recognition for my abilities. I'm really competitive and I'll usually  put a lot of energy into whatever I'm doing. I get annoyed with silly or  pointless rules and I tend to ignore them when they get in the way of  whatever I'm trying to do. Sometimes I can be so directly aggressive  that my bluntness and high energy level can even offend people, but I'm  usually not really trying to upset anyone (although I'm not above  occasionally prodding people for reactions--it's all in good fun.) I  just need a lot of freedom to get involved in a lot of things and  interact with a lot of people, and if I can't feel the level of energy  and excitement that I need, I'll just move on to something else. I have a  kind of natural way with reading people, too--I can just look and  listen and figure out what they're doing. I don't like spending a lot of  time talking about or planning things when I could be experiencing them  instead--whatever problems may come up, I can always figure them out  when I get there. I just have to get moving! I respect people who can  back up their words with real actions--nothing gets the point across  better than getting out there and doing it. If you're not willing to go  out and show the world what you're made of, how can you ever expect to  have any real impact on anything?"  \n\nRead more!\n\n[https://www.typologycentral.com/wiki/index.php/ESTP](https://www.typologycentral.com/wiki/index.php/ESTP)\n\nI find this very accurate. I struggled typing myself for many years because I relate to many different aspects of types. This pinned me down pretty well I guess. Type stuff if you relate fam
4	This is good shit.
7	Wanted to share my favourite poem with you guys!	“Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind; it is not a matter of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees; it is a matter of the will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions; it is the freshness of the deep springs of life.Youth means a tempermental predominance of courage over timidity of the appetite, for adventure over the love of ease. This often exists in a man of 60 more than a boy of 20. Nobody grows old merely by a number of years. We grow old by deserting our ideals.Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul. Worry, fear, self-distrust bows the heart and turns the spirits back to dust.Whether 60 or 16, there is in every human being's heart the lure of wonder, the unfailing childlike appetite of what's next and the joy of the game of living. In the center of your heart and my heart there is a wireless station: so long as it receives messages of beauty, hope, cheer, courage and power from men and from the Infinite, so long are you young. When the aerials are down, and your spirit is covered with snows of cynicism and the ice of pessimism, then you are grown old, even at 20, but as long as your aerials are up, to catch waves of optimism, there is hope you may die young at 80.”\n\n― Youth by Samuel Ullman
3	Let’s just be ourselves and stay forever young 
2	Lovely and oh so true.
1	TL;DR 
9	I think you guys would like this.	
3	No, I'm not calling you rednecks, but this is definitely Se+Ti.
2	What do you think about ISFJs?	
3	Soft and kind by default. A ticking time bomb if things don't behave. I'm very attracted to this type. 
1	I don't, for one reason or another 
1	mondo **T H I C C**
8	Handling confrontation?	So I'm usually a pretty nice / passive person and don't usually assert myself over others. When they speak, I'm usually willing to listen and make harmony with what they are saying. However, this person in particular continues to push the boundary of what I will and won't allow. I get this huge ball of anger and anxiety in my stomach and I know I'm going to have to stop this person in their tracks the next time they speak to me. Any advice on how you handle situations like these? I'm not very good with confrontation and I keep riling myself up unnecessarily by thinking of future scenarios between myself and this person.  \n\n\nThanks.  \n\n\nEDIT: The person is a family friend who is older than me. We're both adults.  \n
7	It really depends on who this person is. It's gonna be a different case if it's your boss or if it's your little cousin
5	There are three ways to deal with a conflict, you can either play their soft side, and make them cooperate with you because they want to. You can force them to cooperate with you or you can form some type of compromise to gain a mutual advantage. How you tackle your problem depends on the situation.\n\nBut what you need to do first is communicate. Have you made it clear that (s)he is pushing your boundaries? I also like to push peoples' boundaries, but to me it's just often just a game and I don't take it too seriously. 
3	Don't lash out. I did something similar after reaching boiling point and I ended up in jail for the night. Instead, communicate but be confident. Don't let it get physical, you'll feel guilty afterwards and regret it even happened. Speak candidly and tell this person they're pissing you off, tell them that it's in nobody's best interest. Good luck buddy.
3	I have many INFJ friends and it's always so interesting to see how differently their thought process is compared to myself- \n\nI'm usually pretty non confrontational, but if I feel it's going to have to happen at some point, I usually try to get a grasp of the conversation I'm going to have,\nthen I'll put together a couple of points that validate my thought process, then I forget about it. \nSeems like I always do better in that kind of situation if I go into it without any preconceived ideas of how the conversation will go\n
11	ISTP seeking help from cooler ESTP big bros	Whenever I try to affect others' emotional values (ie anything that doesn't concern logic...flirting, socializing, asking for favors, etc.), the moment they show discontent, I usually get insecure about it. This is ofc due to inferior Fe, which feels like being a kite in a hurricane. Im not used to functioning in the realms of values so i cant navigate it. My stoicism helps me hide it, but it's all just a front.\n\nYou guys are supposedly more balanced w Ti/Fe. Any practical advice?
12	You're overthinking it. You're not the center of their world, you don't really matter that much to most people. You can't do more than your best, so as long as you do your best there's nothing to be insecure about.
2	IDK, you mean if they don't listen to you after you do it? I just shrug and then go to someone else or do something else.\n\nIf they are discontent/uncomfortable about what you just did I'd ask why. Atleast the reasoning itself helps me not think it was my fault. Maybe they were having a bad day or they are just a jerk. If they don't want to say anything then that's their problem and I'll just hang with someone else to forget about it.
1	To maintain a positive emotional environment, I'd try to grasp their perspective on the issue, bend my own to suit theirs and shift the course of conversation based on the modified logic.   
1	Try accessing Fe through Ti .\n\nTrying to directly access FE will lead to extreme paranoia and the feeling of sacrificing your Self (Ti) for the tribe (Fe). 
4	"Adrenaline Junkie"	Most descriptions of the ESTP paint them to be adrenaline junkies-\nDo you find this to be true for you?\nIf so, how does you see this manifest personally?\n
8	I've been called a sensation addict but I don't see myself that way. It's more the rush of overcoming something challenging rather than the adrenaline. That's like a nice bonus to the after effect but not what I concentrate on. Like, I don't take stupid risks, at least from my point of view. 
5	As a matter of fact no, its not fucking true, and it'd annoying how big this stereotype is. Yes, I'm a ESTP but I don't do stupid shit. I get my Se from working out with weights or calisthenics, doing sprints, driving in a car and enjoying the scenery, eating food, drinking alcohol or getting high,playing video games, going on boat or Jet ski rides, shooting hoops, buying expensive clothing and technology,and mainly rollar coasters or water slides. But the big things that ESTPs are credited with doing fucking gives me anxiety, like driving fast and possibly hitting something then totaling your car and having to pay with money you don't fucking have, going sky diving, skiing down a mountain, driving a motorcycle then possibly getting hit and not being able to walk again or even function, jumping off buildings into pools below, etc. My biggest fear is being paralyzed and not being able to function or take care of myself or stay in shape and I think that's why I got these fears. In a weird way I'm kinda jealous of other dominant Se's, it sucks that I don't got that courage, I also have social anxiety at times so I appwar stand offish at times. I also got a short temper and get frustarted for not being capable of doing really daring and dangerous shit even though deep down I really want to, smfh. I should've been born a Entp, cause at least then I wouldn't feel like something's wrong with me
3	I really like snowboarding. It has been my favorite sport since I learned how and I think that it really helps ease my mind. 
3	I don't ser myself as an adrenaline junkie. Although the last time I got an adrenaline rush was off the rlercoaster ride- Space Mountian in disneyland
2	sort of. \n\nI don't do stupid things though, like jumping into a pile of cactus or driving fast from a police car.\n\nI have a tendency to drive too fast, or have the **urge** to go past a red light when i see I can make it through, but I don't do it. \n\nIdk personally it manifests in me trying new things (firing guns at a shooting range, driving by motorcycle, swimming laps, PKing other people on runescape). Also traveling helps ease my tension a bit.  
1	Hahaha I just spent 3 hours ripping round Bangkok on a scooter, half the time with no helmet on. \n\nAlso it’s not so much about the adrenaline as the focus required. When you’re trying to keep yourself alive you have no other thoughts in your mind. I can’t help it living on the edge is way too much fun. I can’t reach this kind of intense Se focus using any of my other functions. 
-2	I drove full speed with a clothes hanger in my hand.\n\nIt eventually clipped a 5 year old through the eye....\n\nEdit; I was joking....kinda...or was I?!?\nNah I was.
12	Do you guys like making fun of serious things	Is it only me, or fellow ESTPs, but I tend to \n\n* mess with serious types to make them laugh or smile, makes me happy when they end up smiling \n* like to turn serious things into funny things (ex: laughed at a NIN track my friend made me listen to, because it sounded soooo moody/edgy that I find it stupid \[The track was Closer by NIN\])\n* tend to enjoy dark humor/ juvenile humor / ironic humor\n\nPeople we don't go well with are people who are easily butthurt/take things seriously. As much as we try to explain ourselves and why we can't take certain things seriously, and why they shouldn't, they don't understand it? (I hear about ESTPs forcing things on other people, idk if you relate)\n\ntype stuff if you relate
5	stuff. \n\nYes, I really do relate. 
2	Man, I think I’m an infj but sometimes I wonder if I’m an estp...
1	Stuff \n\n\nBig time tho, I feel too many people can't separate goofiness and maturity.
1	I can’t take anything seriously. I mean I can, but also I know that worse case I can just bugger off to the arse end of nowhere and live as a hermit. Kinda hard to take anything seriously when you don’t really give a shit. 
7	Just had lunch with an ESTP classmate	This guy had so much fucking energy...it blew my mind; also, he was extremely animated when he talked. This classmate of mine is 37 y/o and has more energy than me, a 24 y/o ENFP. \n\nI have never hung out with someone with so much energy, character, and confidence. Definitely a personality type that makes a lasting impression. Also, it seems like he needed a lot of stimulus and is very much so young at heart and is full of life...slightly insane and also very Machiavellian vibes.\n\nJust wanted to stop by and let this subreddit know that I find ESTPs fascinating :o \nAre all of you full of energy, ideasss, life, and non-stop action??
10	ESTP is really good at putting on a show & charm when we want, we can show incredible amount of energy and confidence if we feel like it. Especially during a conversation with a new person that we find attractive or fun to be around. In general we can be very relaxed and "normal" depending on the situation.
8	im actually quite introverted IRL, I don't become extroverted unless I'm comfortable with the people around me or I know them very well
3	what did he do that gave you Machiavellian vibes? And yes to all the above.
5	I consider myself pretty lively and animated, sure
6	Do estps have a fucked up short term memory or is it just me ?	I have a very bad short term memory but a great long term memory . Is this a estp thing or only me ?
13	No. By the way I think you take MBTI a bit too seriously bud, it's just a framework. Not the key to all your bizarre questions. 
2	Ya, I feel like I have Alzheimer's everyday.
1	Ha Yes. Although I once described it to someone as you know those fuzzy pictures that when you unfocus you can see the image. 
-3	No, you’re right.\n\nThey’re spastics a good majority of the time.
1	There is 1,464 subscribers on this subreddit...	.
8	*are \n\n"There are 1,464 subscribers..."
0	I’m not stating ESTPs are school shooters...
6	How yall doin?	How are yall?\n\n\nAlso, acceptance when it comes to situations you have no control over, absolutely zero ability to change, etc: how do you handle it? When it comes to me, I just take it on the chin and say fuck it and keep doing my thing once I realize the situation is that way\n\n\nIt's good to be back, boys 
3	Same. If I can’t do anything about the situation I typically am able to move on from it quickly. \n\nIf it’s more emotionally charged and I can’t move on as quick- I usually reframe it so that it’s a good thing to let myself feel thru those feelings for the experience 
1	Hey what's up G, hope all is well on your end. On my end I'm doing well
1	Like you said, I’d just screw it. We’re tougher than most so things will be alright. \n\nGood to see you back. 
4	Anyone here have PS4?	
6	Yes.......is that it ? 
2	Any of you get sick physically and mentally after using Ni and Fe for a long period of time ?	
1	It’s not quite like when those functions (especially Fe) are used extensively, but more like when they can’t be used effectively, that I start to feel mentally incapacitated. Not sure if this ever causes physical sickness though. 
5	Estp on the rise, dating and heartbreak	Ok. I’m 30 and a female. I have dated and been in a 7 year Relationship. I never thought love was an actual feeling. I dated an intj. I figured it was just a mutual bond of friendship. And before that, I was married for a few years. Which I randomly left because he turned into an asshole.\n\nOk fast forward to today. I started to actually crave a relationship last year and fell inlove with an INfp. I use to think I was an intp because I was a hermit due to my social anxiety. But I’m an extrovert and recently found that I’m an Estp. I love adventure and risk within in my life. Ok off topic.\n\nI met my ex in October. We got along and we dated. He was the first guy I’ve ever dated with such a tender soul and so much love. Fast forward to March and I noticed I fell inlove. I got this feeling that when he was around, my life would just feel right. When we kissed, it felt amazing. He made me comfortable and I felt like we were unbreakable. This made me change. We were suppose to move in together and I started getting nightmares of him leaving me. As if he never truly knew me and that he would just leave. I internalized this fear and never told him. I suppose it’s the imposter feeling but with the relationship. Anyways, we had a falling out and he friendzoned me.\n\nI couldn’t handle being just friends since he was my first love. I had to break that off. I regret it every day. It’s been 4 months since the breakup. \n\nHave you guys ever experienced heartbreak? How long did it last? I started dating an enfj(I’ve realized I prefer a feeler after the INfp) and we seem to click well. At least we were clicking well. We have been dating for a month. At first we couldn’t stop texting each other, than he said he’s busy with moving and work and hasn’t been able to text me that much. Than last night, he didn’t even say goodnight. I think he’s ghosting me. Idk. I don’t feel anything for him so I don’t really care. 
7	Time heals all wounds. You are afraid of being alone and you crave a partner. This has nothing to do with types and everything to do with being human. Your nightmares reflected your fear of losing the one person you love. Now you seek a partner to soften the blow of being alone after losing him. My advice to you is to learn to be alone. Strengthen yourself. When you aren’t looking you will find someone meant for you. You are more than capable of anything. You will heal and things will get better. I predict that soon things are going to turn around for you and great things will be on the horizon. Just heal and grow and you will be ready for those things.
2	Aww. I know what you’re going through. Although after a 5 yr relationship w an INFP I can say...that’s a challenging relationship for an stp. \n\nI felt that way after our break up and they (infps) really can help us grow but eventually you will double down on what you really value and it may not be HOW they value things. Don’t be afraid of making mistakes....we thrive in chaos. Sometimes in stress we start to contingency plan which isn’t natural....what is hurt but a feeling? And we can always handle those...fuck it. Get back in the game!!!
1	Well, you done fucked up. Why did you start thinking he didn't know you?
1	Still loyal to the mf who broke my heart. Been 2 years now since we broke up. I see him at the gym some times. And I know I can't go back to that. Dunno why I still feel this loyalty. I don't think too much about it though. It's just there...
8	A splash of color	Flairs are now available in all colors of the rainbow. In two shades even.  \nAnd if you don't like your type's color? Doesn't matter, you can pick another and just change the text.
7	What makes us different from ENTPs? (ESTP vs ENTP)	Hey guys I'm sort of confused whether I'm ESTP or ENTP. Apparently socionics is "more accurate" but I end up relating to the ILE/ENTp description more.\n\nAnyways what do you ESTPs find different with ENTPs?\n\nI am close with an ENTP friend of mines, let me try and list stuff.\n\n* ENTPs care about KNAWLEDGE that doesn't really have much use IRL\n* ENTPs get butthurt about incorrect facts about their particular interests and make a big fuss about correcting person/it.\n* ENTPs tend to be more lazy and don't want to go out much (vidya gaems amirite)\n* ENTPs are a master at making lots of excuses about not doing things \n* ENTPs when sad, blame themselves, give up, and go negative spiral to find roasts of themselves to vent about\n* ENTPs tend to make less drastic decisions (pussies) despite it being a solution\n* ENTPs secretly worry about everyone judging them bad meanwhile IDGAF unless they are close to me\n\nTell me if you guys relate ENTP or ESTP and list some more things you find relevant. Thanks guys.
6	I say the lazier, the more likely an easier solution will be developed. Smart work> Hard work anyway! :)\n\nWell ESTPs are a bit sportsy, bulldog like by nature, rough, want to be tough, inclined to follow the Hulk mentality, and quite conventional. Se vs Ne will tell you guys apart quite well. I will note as an INFJ who's witnessed other INFJs getting it on with ESTPs tend to have this connection, whereas the ESTP is like a vulnerable child at his or her deepest core or center. They have this exterior persona to be the top dog per se, but on the inside it's like a puppy. They try to be intimidating. I'm not really impressed by their nature one bit. Would I fear them? Nope, not at all. They do have intelligence, but I don't consider it on par or a challenge worth the time investing in. With good reason for that as their dominant function is Se. I'm okay with that! :)\n\nENTPs on the other hand, they're actually quite the kind demon in my eyes! I admire their bluntness, calculations, fun, spontaneous yet efficient at flowing through reason, and still at their laziness, they still achieve some great stuff! Ah, I do get entertained by their devilish nature, how they dismantle the reality of one's perception, how they can be the Joker and turn into a really good friend the next second to make revelations. Their random videos of sexual stuff, memes, jokes, on a random whim... A bit too different from me, but... To tell you quite frankly they're the second type I fear most next to INTP who have Ti dominant feature. They have this knack of curiosity of analyzing the coolest intuitive concepts, divulge in ways ideas could be implemented, and have an understating of humanity to the point they may influence ideology if they pull through in great effort. \n\nTo add ESTPs are pretty sportys, ENTPs tend to be in places like debate clubs in conclusion! :)
9	Ok, first thing, fuck you, you oblivious cunt.\n\n*Cough* *Cough*\n\nAnyway! \nI’m ENTP and I NEVER blame myself and put myself down for anything! \n\nPeople are like bread and the blame is like the butter.\n\nI also make drastic decisions quite frequently.\n\nAlso, I don’t give a shit what other people think of me.\n\nWhy should I care about what someone else thinks about me when in reality they’re in the same position in life as myself and have no authority over me (even if they technically do)\n\nYou aren’t the brightest light on the Christmas tree are you?\nI bet you’re that one bulb that is so dim it might as well be considered dead.\n\n\nEdit; I’m gonna type you as “ENTP” so everything you said will automatically reflect on you...
1	Ah, yes, what a fool proof way of distinguishing Ne-Si from Se-Ni. \n\nSounds like you're projecting subjective experiences with your ENTP friend onto the cognitive functions.\n\nCome back when your knowledge of MBTI surpasses the 16personalities test.
11	Does getting a new thing in your life always motivate and push you to do better in life in other aspects of your life too ?	I generally am in a very good mood after I get new stuff like a new car / bike I love very much or even a phone or even small things I like. I feel they energize me and motivate me and I get super charged about life. \n\nI am a minimalist but I  am not entirely and think that sort of  life doesn't  suits me too. \n\nI am guessing this has to do with my Se mainly and it's need for new sensations as I get bored after I experience something for a while and need new things to experience to get charged . \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this ? 
7	Man, it seems nice to read this since I feel the same way and I’ve been hard on myself thinking that I’m a materialistic a-hole!\nNothing motivates me to study more than a new pen or a new notebook. Do I feel as if I’ve been slacking off from working out? I’ll just buy a new pair of gym shorts then I’m good to go. \nOf course I don’t constantly buy new things for motivation reasons but every now and then I need this kind of “stimulant” for my brain.
2	Hey can someone explain how se manifests in esfps like I’m 5? Thanks	In reference to r/explainlikeimfive but posting it here because there’s more se doms here who know what mbti is lol
1	ESTP or ESFP? 
2	Found this in r/entp , any idea about how this manufests in estps ? The Ni grip.	I think Ne-Fe loops manifest as narcissism. And I think that Ne-Si "loops" aka the "Si grip" manifest as hypochondria. Si becomes aware of negative bodily sensations, while Ne and Ti analyze it. Interesting how various loops and grip behaviors in various types can correspond to unhealthy mental conditions... maybe MBTI could be answer to solving these.
3	ENTP here, have an ESTP friend. I don't know what her Se-Fe is like because she's chronically ill and can't do most of the reckless ESTP stuff, but Se-Ni loop or Ni grip happens when she loses trust in everything around her and the things she notices around her serve her as the base for the most dramatic stories; paints everything black, refuses to see possibilities, suddenly the most mundane things take existential value, can't take action, overthinking... a theatre kid. Take ESFP dramaqueen, a normal INFJ and then mix it with ENTP hypochondria, but that could just be the circumstances - she doesn't only theorize about what her personal experience means for her physical health, but also for her status, for people's motives, what the implications for the future are... \nI knew another ESTP once and despite being really smart, she sometimes would repeat something funny she heard and laugh about it and then repeat it again, and again... when everybody already stopped laughing and just thought it's weird. Could also be patronizing, seem a bit extreme, inconsiderate, reckless or impulsive. Somewhat of a sociopath, but that would be an extreme exaggeration.

9	Dating an enfp	So... I've recently started dating an ENFP. When we're together, we're awesome. We feed off of each other and I could honestly see falling in love with this girl. But when we're off doing our own things she seems distant and erm... Uninterested?\n\nI have already learned that, without pushing too hard, communication is a huge thing for us to stay on the same page, and we both feel better after.\n\nBut I guess I'm concerned that I'm barking up a difficult compatibility tree here.\n\nThoughts? Am I just over-thinking this? 😬
5	I’m an ESTP married to an ENFP! I think what’s more important than our personality types are our goals and interests. We both have similar ideas of success and happiness, just have different approaches to get there. I think you could definitely be compatible as long as you’re both willing to work toward it. Of course you’ll have your challenges, but what relationship doesn’t? 
3	I’m also dating an ENFP and have been doing that for 2 years. \n\nIt is going to be A LOT of work, but as long as you guys like and love each other enough and communicate really well, it can really work. My SO and I have been through some rough patches, but always came out stronger than before. We know each other really well and we discovered that it’s important for both parties to be aware of their differences. \n\nThere will be a lot of misunderstandings, but as long as you solve them right away; you can really be compatible. It just takes more work than it normally would take, but if you are willing to put in that work; it will get to be a fullfilling and loving relationship.
1	Omaiga.. thats what i do with the ESTP i'm in love...\nWe are awesome together but when we are with our group i dont join (dont want to disturb)\n\nNot dating tho.. this is confusing for me 
1	Omg this is me and my ESTP boyfriend. In person we are so good together but when it comes to texting our conversations are so dull. I want to have a deep meaningful conversations over text and talk about the most random things we think of and desires we have for life. But we often just go back and forth about being tired, wanting food, and silly things happening at that very moment. I went off to Army Basic Training last summer and when I got back things were so different. We are close again now but it was really slow at first. Now I'm worried because he is leaving this summer for Airforce Basic Training and then onto job training and then I'm also going to my job training for the Army. I'm in the reserves but he's active duty so he could be sent anywhere afterwards. He seems like he is wanting to stay committed and has made many comments about wanting to get married and having a future with me, but it's just the long distance I'm worried about and not seeing each other in person. I sure hope our communication gets better before all that long distance stuff takes place.\nDo you ESTPs think that the texting conversations with ENFPs are dull as well? Or is that just on the ENFP side? \n\nLol I'm sorry, I just stalked this feed, saw this post, and had to comment😂
7	ESTP relationships	I’ve started dating an ESFJ, the first two dates were pretty cool but I got so bored during the third date I ended it two/three hours earlier than we had initially planned. My last two relationships were kinda like this too. Why do I keep on getting bored of my dates, Is this an ESTP thing or am I just an a-hole?
8	Check your enneagram type, you might a 7. 7s have a way of quickly judging whether a person is interesting or not, superior or inferior, exceptional or pedestrian and commonplace, and just as quick dropping their interest in them. This woman is type 7w6 herself, though probably not an ESTP, and she talks about this quick change of interest ~1 minute into this video: [**Type Seven: Integral Recovery**](https://www.youtube.com/attribution_link?a=Ckr9vroj-44&u=/watch%3Fv%3DmtkMdq5-Y1Y%26feature%3Dshare).   \n    \nOtherwise try dating Ni types, such as INFJ, INTJ, ENFJ, and ENTJ. They have some of the more interesting relationships with ESTPs: [**ESTP Love Types**](https://www.personalitycafe.com/estp-articles/289-love-types-estp-5.html#post10023554). With ESFJs from the few relationships I've seen I feel like they might be a little too simple for ESTPs. They are too open with their feeling and don't leave much for that Se-Ni push-and-pull game that creates a spark in Se-Ni relationships. Nevertheless, they are a good match and I've seen a few ESTP-ESFJ married couples and very loyal childhood-into-adulthood type of friendships.
4	Maybe change your ppl-I-want-to-date filter. Why did you choose the ESFJ and the ones in the past?
1	Try an isfp. Although be aware it's our supervisor type but the high you get off the relationship is unparalleled.
7	You know you’re an ESTP when?	
13	When you hate slow walkers. 
10	When people call you "smart" but you have both really shitty grades and really good grades. not saying all estps are smart just saying that when we like something were usually pretty good at it :)
11	You know that no one gets where your coming from so you smile and say "fuck em, fuck em all."
5	ESTPs and school	How do you guys motivate yourself to finish college?\n\nI'm trying to finish my BS in computer science but it's just so damn hard. I don't see the point in continuing taking all these stupid classes that I don't care about (Calculus 1-4, Chem 1-2. \[anything not related to my major here\]) but is required for me to PAY FOR and to SPEND TIME on. I can't fucking do it anymore.\n\nI'm honestly contemplating dropping out because I'm just bummed. I'm taking summer classes and it's been eating my soul away for the past 3 months and I just hate college. I know I'm bitching and being a pussy but when you overhear about "connections", people getting jobs without a degree, internship > GPA, experience >>> graduating, then college all sounds like BULLSHIT and I'm not spending 30k each year just to get loans that I'll waste my life on to repay. \n\nI don't want to trigger my parents but I don't know man. How do you guys get through all this mess? I searched on ESTP reddit about motivation and all I get is a bunch of "yeah I dropped out of college lol" and it's demotivating lmao.
5	I just finished my bachelor degree in engineering: computer science and mechanical.\n\nI don't know how far you are with your degree currently, or if you've made the right choice studying what you are studying. But from my experience it's better to stick to your "bad" decision. As far as I know, the future does not promise much good for unskilled labour.  And having a STEM degree will always gives you an edge. However, I'm European, so I'm definitely not in the same situation as you are with your student debt.\n\nI had a "rough" couple of first two years in college, while my friends were on holiday and partying I spent my two entire summers studying. What helped me a lot is stoicism. It's a philosophy that should feel right for any ESTP. Learns you to only worry about issues you can actually change and have control over - I highly recommend it. For now I would just focus on your short term goals and only once they're finished you can possibly review your long term plans.\n\nI have a pretty nice life right now: I have 3 months of summer holiday, including one internship and cheap holidays with my friends, plus I'm going to study abroad next year. All because I stuck with my decision, I kept my focus, kept working and fighting in my previous years.
2	"I'm studying something I don't want to study... And I'm paying for it... To get a job I probably won't want... What do?"\n\ndon't do it lol. Not like you will be happy doing that for a living. Quit sooner than later, take an off year, think about your life a little
1	Boring career that's why
21	ESTP stuff I guess	Uh so I guess I'm ESTP, but here is stuff that I do idk if you relate:\n\n1. Skim posts and get the gist then answer quickly, sometimes I forget a small detail that changes the entire perspective lol\n2. I need time to think about things and visualize them in my head to make sense to me\n3. Im introverted when i meet ppl i dont know cuz i want to get to know who they are after observing them for a while, then i talk to them/assume their interests, and if we click I go extroverted bonkers\n4. I get triggered if i stay at home for too long in my room i want to go out, if i don't i start doing crazy shit\n5. when i need to think about things more i sleep/nap on it so my brain settles down and finds the answer\n6. I like doing things on my own\n7. when I teach people I tell the concept of the thing in a simplistic, yet funny way so they get it easily. I don't teach like how people do like formal language from the textbook. I honestly find textbooks are TL;DR and everything can be simplified to like 15 mins.\n8. I get tired of classes that are too theoretical like "wtf am I going to use this for" kind of thing\n9. like to make things simple and easy\n10. i love negotiating/getting things off craigslist\n11. i somehow easily find ways to make money\n12. eurobeat is my life\n13. optimistic\n14. appreciate useful things (compasses, watches, medkit, emergency water) and tends to hoard them for future use\n15. like talking to ppl next to me when bored (ex: airport asking where someone is going and why) \n\nwhat are your ESTP stuff and post then, also post if you relate
15	I read the first one then started skimming the rest of the post and it took me a good 5 seconds to understand the irony
2	A fellow Eurobeat fan! High five
1	nice
1	Number 9 is unnecessary on the list as everyone likes easy and convenient
1	ha, yeah this is me as well. 
1	Nice compilation, I check with most. 
1	Eurobeat is extreme BS
2	(Cross-post) Temperament and Humor (All over 14 Welcome)	 Hello! I recently posted a survey you might find interesting. It would really help me out if you would participate!\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/92ynz1/academic\_temperament\_and\_humor\_all\_over\_14\_welcome/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/92ynz1/academic_temperament_and_humor_all_over_14_welcome/)
4	Damn.	
1	Not everyone here is a male
5	What do you guys think of ESFP's?	I am working with a possible ESFP. Very similar to me. Been through a lot. Overcame them. But... I think, the main difference that I notice is... she seems to actively want to be the center of attention. Extremely confident and great social skills. Contrary to stereotypes... my co-worker is surprisingly smarter than people make her out to be. Or maybe I'm just biased cause I prefer street smarts over book smarts. So what have your interactions with ESFP as an ESTP been like? And how do you spot them? Thanks
3	My partners in crime!! Oddly enough I have some of the best deep conversations with ESFPs. It's like, with other types it becomes too pseudo intellectual and fake deep. But with these guys we can just talk about real stuff and relate on a personal level. 
2	Hi! I have a couple of ESFP friends, for many years. We have a lot of fun and activities together. They really love to be the center of attention; and does not hide the fact that they like it.  At work they can get on your nerves, or if you live together. any time you have to spend more than your relaxed «playtime» could cause friction;just because estps and esfps are so similar ; messy, impulsive, etc .. We never have really bonded in a deep way; conversation mostly will stay on a surface level with most ESFPs I have known; of course with some exceptions. 
2	One of my longest, closest friends is one. I was always the action oriented one, and she the feel it out first one. 
2	ENFP here I think  You guys Awesome and in my next live I want to be you guys ESFP!
1	ESFPs piss me off a lot since they can be naturally charismatic and entirely abhorrent behind the scenes at the same time. Mix that with oversensitivity and it makes for a lot of no-no’s in my book.
0	I think Meyers Briggs is about as accurate as horoscopes. . . 
12	Are we actually terrible at communication?	I do believe that I can talk to and get acquainted with literally anyone barring any strange biases, however, once someone gets close to me as a friend or lover I feel a strange disconnect with them as if I'm on the same page as them but going a different speed and that difference somehow causes communication which I end up not noticing until it's too late. Is this cause of weak Fi? I've tried to focus on these things when they happen but it seems really taxing and unnatural to me. Like some weird negative feedback loop or defense mechanism. I've also found that Fe doms like ENFJs can really help me from digging my own grave in this regard. Any rational thoughts would be appreciated.
5	Im terrible when feelings are involved. I can completely freeze up, but in daily life considering practical subjects I'm very vocal and direct. 
1	I know I'm not
1	ESTPs tend to be poor at expression when emotion is involved; however, if they can express well without holding back, then communication is lively and fun, almost regardless of the context \n
2	I need more sensors for my survey! Please help.	[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2QSNJPP](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2QSNJPP)\n\nIt's an MBTI Romantic Relationship Survey. \n\nIt's super basic.

I'm going to use in my statistical analysis class.\n\nI'll post results when complete.\n\nFeedback is welcome.
10	Is anyone else here (much) better at thinking when they’re moving?	Unless I’m tired, I can not think without pacing around and walking everywhere. When I sit still and try to think of a solution to a problem, it feels like the mental version of having cataracts and I need to walk, dance, twitch my legs, etc. every few minutes to get it cleared up. I get some comments that I pace too much or that I look nervous when I’m standing still. It takes so damn long to write Reddit posts that are this long since I can’t exactly walk around and type too efficiently (I’m twitching my legs just to keep typing). Is that just an ESTP thing or is that a me thing?
7	I definitely do. I pace on the phone and during phone interviews, it keeps me thinking 
6	Yes, it takes a few trips to the bathroom to come up with one good paragraph in an essay. 
6	I think we are best at handling a crisis situation. Almost we come into our element .
3	yeah just walking back and forth in a room helps me think.
4	Always pace when I’m on the phone. \nUsually do my best thinking while running, or mowing, or something that keeps me busy 
2	I cannot confirm that what you're describing is a trait of ESTP, but I can say for a fact that I HAVE to be moving to have my best thoughts, or even a solid conversation on the phone.  \nEven if it's driving around instead of walking, I still need changing scenery to be at my best mentally.
1	I love standing amd writing at a board. It also helps others follow my thinking, since I can make a new space for  new idea that comes from the first idea.\n\nYou know what I am talking about.
1	Whenever I'm going to be on the phone for a long time I usually leave whichever building I'm in and go for a walk.
1	idk I fall asleep then find the answer in my dreams
3	Any estp have the rage to go back in time and destory people who were disrespectful to you?	With a weak Fe growing up emotionally dint know what people were trying to do  and seemed insignificant and avoided it but a lot of people seemed to have tried to emotionally fuck with me  while growing up only realising it now after developing Fe to some extent. 
3	I slammed some weights at the gym last week while i having a bad day. An old lady complained about the noise and her personal trainer told me off in a condescending way. Was thinking about smashing the back of his knee with a heavy plate but didnt do it because I was in the wrong.
2	I always knew ESTPs were cooler than others, but I never imagined we were able to go back in time
1	Not particularly 
4	Fellow ESTPs, how often do you road rage?	For me, whenever I’m pissed off about something and happen to be driving. It’s quite an effective way to vent. 
5	I’m more likely to give other people road rage than get it myself
3	I get impatient sometimes, but not really. I used to drive really aggressively, speeding and weaving and all that. I got pulled over a few times and got away with murder, but then once I got a ticket for like 3 over and said fuck it, no more speeding or aggressive driving or anything\n\n\n\nCool as a clam, I'll go for a drive for stress relief though. I love driving 
4	[deleted]
6	What are you experience with weed ?	I personally feel it tends to activate our Ni and detach us temporarily from our Se, sometimes it can aid in relieving us from any stress we are under but it can also put us under a sense of paranoia since we are detached from Se and put into Ni.  \n\n
4	It makes me tired but otherwise not much
3	Im the only one out of all my friends who actually gets quite hyper when I smoke . I become (even more) talkative and want to go on adventures lol. I tend to smoke while I’m out bc if I smoke before bed I can’t sleep. Even indicas . 
3	I’m one to just eat a shitload and then just melt into the sofa enjoying some old school dubstep. I can get to a state that’s as close to lucid dreaming as I can manage. \n\nOh I have riden the mountain bike up whistler while blasted. A line while baked off my ass is one of the best things I’ve ever done. 
3	Had a phase as a teenager where I smoked everyday, realized that it made me lazy and unproductive so I stopped and have only smoked a few times at parties
3	paranoia 
1	I agree. I was just thinking about that. 
1	Didn't particularly enjoy it. Hard drugs are much better.
10	ESTPs, how do you not give a fuck about people?	ESTPs are known as these badass, cool guys with great people skills. Now maybe it's not true for all ESTPs, but most of you for sure is better than me when it comes to dealing with people.\n\nINTP here, I just can't seem to find my niche. I always feel like I don't fit in. Given that I don't really like conversing with people very much, but I don't look like someone who doesn't give a fuck. I just look like a loner.\n\nWell the thing is, I do give a fuck. When I am already with someone, I just act awkwardly, I tend to "overcompensate" on some things like being too friendly and accepting. I feel like when I don't I am doing something wrong somehow. I sometimes can't say no and when I feel like "oops, I don't want to do this" I can't help but just suck it up. How do you get around these types of situations?
9	If you don’t like conversing with people but want connections...you’re gonna have a bad time. \n\nXSTP here. I don’t care for small talk but I recognize it’s necessary as a means to an end. \n\nSometimes that small talk leads to better and further connections. \n\nI do give a fuck about most things. Just not about people that aren’t worth giving a fuck over. How do I differentiate? \n\nCan they help me? Can I learn from them? Do I need them? Do I enjoy them as people? Then they serve a purpose and that in turn helps me. So win/win. \n\nIf they don’t then no need to be impolite but no need to care enough to exert effort. \n\n
5	It's unreasonable and unrealistic to care about *everyone* and *everything*\n\n\nWhen making a new connection, initially it's motivated by that person providing my life with something I like and want more of, or need. It grows from that, but it starts that way. I try to reciprocate as well. When that ends, it's over\n\n\nIf someone has demonstrated they're unwilling to help themselves, I feel for them but don't do anything to help them because they've proven to me it's a waste of time. I'll try up until that point\n\n\nConfidence is a huge part of any and all of this \n\n\nDoes that help?
3	I think it could be due to our Se and our strong hold over reality and what is , so it helps us take the right decision and make right moves when with people and to access them well and not care even if it means to hurt or not obey any rule or be overly friendly and docile whomever  it might be. \n\nWith intp with your weak Se I think you guys are either too submissive or too agressive without a true balance and moderation for what is needed for when . \n\nSe blindness:\n\nThe individual tends to overreact to aggressive or confrontational behavior, taking it as a personal threat when it may only be a knee-jerk reaction or the result of a bad mood.\nHe tends to avoid intruding on others' space or engaging in behavior that may be perceived as coercive, and tries hard to handle his needs by being disciplined and well-prepared himself - rather than relying on others to do things for him. If these strategies fail, his efforts at dealing with the resulting conflict make him look actively pushy in a way that appears awkward and unnatural to others. This opens him up to painful criticism and feelings of weakness and helplessness.\nHe is able to moralize and instruct others about what they should do and why, but he is not prepared for others' active resistance or refusal to do as he says. In his mind, this would require him to put aside reason and good feelings and simply make the other person do what is necessary. This is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for him to do."
2	We're just amazing people :)
1	I used to act like a straight-up INTP, and I understand what you meant in terms of being aware of how odd I feel. At some point, I realized how much people danced for social normalcy and how funny it was. I just started acting like myself afterward, disregarding rules I didn’t feel like following and being the brash and “cool” ESTP. I reasoned that I wasn’t the weird one so long as everyone else did stuff out of their comfort zone just to fit in.
1	It’s easy and the answer is simple. If you want to have meaningful relationships, you’re going to have to talk to people. \n\nSo the solution is to just shut up and do it. 
2	I'm an ESTP but...	Could I just be an ISTJ acting like an ESTP? 
9	I dunno, you tell us
3	I just left a comment, but could it be that I let my sister log on and leave this comment for me?
2	How's ur life going? When I'm down in the dumps (which is not my default state) I resonate with an overplanned asshole hermit, rather than a fun and active estp. \n\nThese two types are quite different. I know ISTJ's that are scared by my disregard of ethics and rules. 
1	What makes you think so?
8	How do estps see intps.?	Do you guys like intps? Or do you guys hate them or get annoyed by them or..... \nWhat are your views about them? 
7	My cousin is an INTP and we have a few things in common. I think how INTPs think of themselves in their own heads are what we ESTPs are actually like in real life. INTPs think too much and we ESTPs do too much. Both types represent the need for constant activity- one mental (INTP) and one physical (ESTP). We’re both problem solvers by nature. INTPs think deeply and come up with many awesome solutions to problems in their own heads but they seem to never bring those thoughts to life in the real world. ESTPs (like myself) come up with great solutions too but we don’t put anywhere near the amount of forethought and planning into it.
5	Was close with one intp for a couple of years and he was extremely intelligent and the most knowledgeable person I have met and I learnt a lot of things under him as a mentor but he seemed oblivious to my se a lot and I found him to be extremely isolated and dark in his perspectives when I dint resonate with what he said , he seemed to get angry and very sensitive when I disagreed to things and he seemed very narsistic and also had a grandiose vision of who he was in his mind , are you guys extremely blind to SE ? Or can you say anything about it . \n\nAs a estp I find some aspects and parts of the intp to be completely retarded and not at all grounded in reality. I feel they compensate the use of Ti and Ne to compensate for the lack of Fi and Se. Is it true ? 
2	I’m always friends with these guys. Hilariously logical and know that I’m joking when I say stupid shit ironically. They also share my zero fucks given attitude which always make me like a person. 
2	I like them or dislike them about 50/50, I can't stand how detached they can be from social spheres or really anything other than their little world, and overanalyzing things to the point of defeating common sense. Those two things can be immensely frustrating but I keep that in mind going into my interactions and usually I can work it out and kind of unravel things for them
3	Honestly it depends on the individual INTP. Sometimes you meet one and think wow this individual is really get example of how you successfully integrates your functions and they dont have a stick up their ass. We can have insight and meaningful conversations. But on the other hand you meet a lot of unhealthy ones on the internet and it's a fucking nightmare to deal with. Cannot have a reasonable conversation nor anything really. But the most part the ones I know are cool with me and in turn I'm cool with them, but if you try to shit on me, I'm going to shit on you. But that goes for all types 
3	These are so funny to read. \n\nI keep coming across about Se blindness for INTPs, honestly. That’s not an understatement. Personally, I fail to acknowledge the world around me. \n\nThat thing about mistyping however, that just shouldn’t be allowed to slide. Clearly if that person don’t have enough info to type the other person, then they shouldn’t. \n\nAnd I forgot why I was writing...\n\nThe limited ESTPs I’ve known have been interesting and entertaining. Would recommend and try again. \n\nYou guys really hate the idea of people being loners/detached? It just takes a hell amount of effort for INTPs to do something out of their comfort zone. Like 300% more effort than things we want to actively do.\n\nAnd I forgot the rest of what I was going to say...\n\nHigh Ti! Yes. That’s fun. \n\nI think ESTP and INTP can have great relationship between them, all they need to do is not be stubborn, open up a little and not use their personality as a excuse.
1	Metal music	For those who like metal what are your favorite genres?\n\nAlso is there a genre you think is fitting for ESTP
1	METALCORE!!!!!
9	Non-ESTPs on this sub, what are you here for?	Not that you like can't be here or I have an issue with it
6	See what ESTPs talk about, how they think, how they process emotions. I do it with every sub.\n\nI particularly enjoy ESTPs' responses. Usually pretty funny or make me see something in a different way.
7	To be more like you\n\nINFJ and wannabe ESTP. 
3	The way y'all talk is super entertaining to me. So straight/to the point/matter of fact, but still fucking hilarious. It's the exact opposite of how I communicate lmao
3	I browse both the ESTP and ISTP subs about once or twice a month just to see what the other types with my same functions are like and how they think. Pure curiosity, basically (I'm INFJ).
3	I subscribe to random MBPI subs to try and get a feel for then
6	ENFJ here. \n\nMy gf is an ESTP, so I come here to better understand the way she might view/feel about things. 
2	Curiosity. That damn curiosity. \n\n(INTP)
1	INTJ here, seeing an ESTP for a few months and interested in insights into how ESTPs tick.
1	Intj here.\n\nJust curious about estps and their emotions, and whether it's cowardice or just not giving a fuck that makes you guys just a stop caring about people all of a sudden.... \n\nI don't understand you at all............ lol 
0	Am I ESTP?	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\nsome dudes are saying ESTP. Alright it's either I'm ESTJ or ESTP let's go. Here is the description of me as best as I try to describe myself: [https://www.reddit.com/r/entj/comments/8jpag9/am\_i\_a\_lazy\_ass\_entj\_or\_something\_else/](https://www.reddit.com/r/entj/comments/8jpag9/am_i_a_lazy_ass_entj_or_something_else/)\n\nHere is what other ppl have been saying about me:\n\nr/ENTP says I'm not ENTP, (one dude gave a long essay why I'm ENTP tho). r/mbti says ESTJ. r/ENTJ says I'm some ISTJ or ESTP. Another dude say I'm 100&#37; ESTP.\n\nWhat will it be lads?\n\nHoly shit pls get this over with

2	Yes
1	Heart break- how do you heal/ deal ?	So have you ever been heartbroken, and by whom? What did you do to feel better? And did it ever really go away? Hoping for some ESTP advice from fellow ESTPs (non english speaker if any misspellings cut me some slack;) )
4	Basically just keeping myself distracted, especially with new activities. Take up a new hobby, meet and talk to new people, yada yada yada.\n\nAlso telling myself shit like "He wasn't good for me anyway", "We never would've been happy", "If it's over now, he wasn't the one for me anyway", "I'll meet someone better someday". \n\nI tend to move on fairly quickly tbh, depending on the intensity of the previous relationship.
2	Move on with my life 
2	I usually focus my mind on something else, work, reading or working out to the point where I kinda forget it happened and then acknowledge it did 
1	Time heals heartbreak
1	Girls mostly, my crushes always seem to end with to people I considered good friends until though I don't think thats an ESTP thing. Just move on, focus on the big picture. Generally, if I have some reminder of that person, then it's really easy for me to feel those feelings again. Working out, team sports, hanging out with genuine fun people like enfps lol 
2	im impressed by the estp.	they just so cool.they have the potential to be psychopaths,highest percentage in prisions,all kind of mean badasses.i know i know.estps arent ALL like that.but still they so cool.when they want something they go straight for it.fearless.they also charsmatic and master manipulators,having that ni fe in there...........so how do you guys do it?
16	Dude, get some help.
7	We don’t really think about it, it just flows naturally!\n\nAlso, are you sure you aren’t making the ESTP personality type seem cooler than it actually is? \nI mean, we’re also all just normally functioning people in our daily lives :).
3	It’s because we know that rules don’t apply to us. 
4	Personally when I'm at my best, I just don't think.. Everything flows and all information around me regarding the environment, situation, etc. is analyzed in a split second and usually the best action immediately follows. It's as if I read the "vibe" everything gives off on me and then logically figure out why I'm getting that vibe and then act in best accordance to it. I'm not sure if every ESTP feels or acts the same way, but my over-confident self thinks that I'm one of those rare G ass ESTPs with high enough IQ to let it all come together. I'm 20, can seemingly, consistently, make better decisions than both of my parents and siblings and of them and others I know relatively well, can read off what they're thinking before they speak

1	any estp enneagram 8s?	ny estp enneagram 8s here,and do you often struggle with temper or anger issues? and in the past have you realy snaped at someone and went into rage?
2	Sadly i dont have my enneagram result but i guess i would be an 8 too.\n\nIn my past about 4-6 years ago i had some trouble controlling my temper i was just really impulsive. Now for 3 years i smoke weed and it really helped calm me down and chill about alot of things but i get lazy when i over use it.\n\nI never snaped someone. Never felt the need but wasnt a typical Estp in my past. Overprotective mother made me week.  
2	I'm a 8w9 and not really do I have anger issues and/or problems. I would say, when I do get angry its explosive akin to a volcano erupting. But the thing is that it is rare for me to get really heated and angry. I'm generally calm and relaxed at all times, but hell everyone has a limit. 
2	ESTP 8w9. Used to be very impulsive and quick to anger in my teen years, it just went away as I grew older and gave less shits. Being wing 9 might have contributed to mitigating my temper too, being somewhat peace loving and often going along with others.
2	8w7 and yes, I've had a lot of blow ups, many of them well warranted. Drinking always made me much more aggressive. Becoming a father calmed me down a lot, as did becoming a felon (repeat offending ain't no joke).\nWhat specific info are u looking for? Broad question, and I've got a lot of experience in this shit lol. 
3	Am I an ESTP or an INTP	Or something else. I’m a mess of a person going through depression, anxiety, paranoia on top of thinking I might have autism or bipolar disorder and probably impossible to type but I think MBTI is fascinating so here we go regardless \n\nI’m gonna try and describe myself when I’m not experiencing these mental issues which is a challenge considering it’s been two years (and honestly that’s not even true, it’s been far more) since I have “officially” been going through this, but the person I am without these disorders obviously more indicative of how I really am\n\nFor the longest time I thought I was introvert because people and my interactions with them annoyed me, but turns out I actually think I’m an extrovert with social anxiety. But nothing is more intoxicating to me than someone completely understanding me and being around people who like me for who I am. Not to mention if I’m around people who don’t understand me I literally go insane/am without someone who understands me too long. However it’s incredibly hard to me to find those people without dedicating a lot of time and energy to finding these relationships, and I’m lazy and don’t have that energy (maybe I’m an introvert after all) and therefore don’t experience this feeling often, and feel hollow most of the time because of an absence of it, to the point where I go periods of forgetting I ever could feel that and need to it to feel like myself and a functional human being.\n\nI personally think I’m good at keeping conversations going, starting them, ending them, etc, however when I begin to suspect the other person doesn’t like me/finds me weird/isn’t enthused with the conversation I shut down and become the most reserved and standoffish version of myself. \n\nFor the longest time I thought I was the kind of person who found joy in planning for the future, thinking about the future, but I’ve begun to realize I only hype myself up to be completely dissapijnted because reality never lives up to my imagination. I find the healthiest version of myself has no expectations and finds much more joy living in the present and being fully grounded. I still have an active and overwhelmingly powerful imagination but I find it’s far more self satisfying to keep that side of me to myself, I.e. I truly don’t believe there’s any social benefit to being imaginative, yet I don’t think it’s a negative quality, just something reserved for you.\n\nI’m overwhelmingly a thinker over a feeler. Even when happiest I have a hard time expressing emotion and find more solace in keeping what I’m exactly feeling within while expressing a more “easy to digest” feeling around others through words and actions. I strongly sympathize and slightly empathize with strong displays of emotion but don’t think words or actions can provide the necessary support, and therefore resent anyone who does try to comfort me with words or actions when I am feeling something overwhelming. The most rewarding and comforting thing is for someone to just be with you without needing to provide something or interfere with what you’re feeling. Unfortunately it’s near impossible to find these types of friendships/relationships in my experience.\n\nMy learning style is definitely individualistic. I hate teamwork and prefer to do everything myself. In a group project I either take over or do nothing, finding a middle ground by partly contributed always leaves me pissed off. It’s hard not to sound like a prick but I’ve always been good at school and getting good grades. I’m smart but not top of my class. I tend to need more time to get things done but I have always had a knack for knowing exactly what something wants out of me (even if I disagree with what they want) and providing that easily (I hate people yet I’m a people pleaser?) I don’t like being given free reign in a project because it means more work, but my output is always more rewarding than if I had guidelines, and I admire what I’ve created more. Specifically when it comes to school I’ve been above average to, sigh, pretty damn good at most subjects, I like learning about history most, “doing” English most, and don’t hate math but need more time than most at my skill level to complete it. \n\nI’m open minded because I’m almost annoyingly able to put myself in someone’s else’s shoes immediately. Arguments with me involve lots of interpretations of what the other person is saying, trying to nail exactly what they’re saying, acknowledging the counter argument, refuting it, and basically using every critical thinking skill I have to justify and hopefully persuade the other person. I can’t stand arguments based in emotion even thought I know there’s no ulterior motive to them, and that someone can’t help but base an argument in emotion when the subject is inherently emotional. I tend to find when I do the same my arguments aren’t taking seriously and I’m dismissed as being emotional ironically, so maybe my insecurity of not “delivering”an emotional argument correctly makes me resent those who can, do, and stick by these feelings instead of changing them every 0.2 seconds. The only people I truly hate are overly judgmental people, I feel so claustrophobic around them I can’t stand it. I’m obsessed with how people see me and if I feel someone sees my negatively everything in me wants to prove them wrong (if I see something in them that I admire) if I see nothing in them I admire all I want to do is tear into them viciously.\n\nSpeaking of change I tend to switch interests although i do have several permanent hyper focuses that I’ve always had since childhood, but other more surface level hobbies and fascinations change constantly. I love to interpret things that I’m learning in my own way, connect the dots in my own way, creates charts, diagrams illustrating my thought process, etc\n\nThis post is a mess because I had the worst fuckkng day of my life yesterday and I don’t say that lightly. I’m basically separate for someone to diagnose me, tell me who I am, tell me what I’m good at, what I need to change, etc. A therapist can only do so much. \n\nI could go and on cause my favorite pastime is analyzing myself (or at when I’m in the depressed mess of a state that I’m in) but I figure anyone with a normal attention span is over me at this point.
4	First thing first, kiddo you are self diagonosing way to much. No one can suffer from every mental illness on the planet. if you ask me why I think yourself diagnosing it's because you put autism in the same category as mental illness which it isn't and you say that you can completely empathize with other people which you would be mostly unable to do if you were autistic. \n\nOk. MBTI wise:\n\nYou sound like an INTP to me. Friendly but reserved and maybe not too eutusiastic. I am an ESTP and unlike you, like working in a team. I am autistic ( officialy diagnosed) which makes me a little awkward, but I manage. I not that good at sciences but very good at all areas involving humanities. You seem to describe yourself in many words, hinting to me that you are intuitive. Sensors, like me, do not analyse themselves very often.

1	[deleted]
1	Plan a day out somewhere for you both. Bonus points if it’s somewhere he’s been meaning to go for a while. For me I’d like it if someone organised a bike that I’d been meaning to on but cause I’m shit at planning I haven’t yet sorted myself out to go. 
1	Any estps suffering from the take- off syndrome by not zeroing in what one wants to choose as a carrer in life and just passing time?	
3	No one can help you without knowing your background either. Try asking for help with your full story over at /r/infj 
2	Yes
1	I'm very doubtful that whatever problems you have, have to do with your personality type! And I'm also not sure if overanalyzing your problems will help either
2	Affinity	I realize this is unrelated somewhat but it’s been on my mind. Everyone seems to have an affinity to something except me. Sometimes I think I’m one of those “Good at all, master of none” type people. Is that even a thing?
4	I’m the same way. It’s actually nice because once you accept that you’ll never be the best at anything, you learn to enjoy just being good at a bunch of stuff. \n\nIf that makes any sense...
2	Yes
2	[deleted]
4	Older estps what are your advice for younger estps. Also how is your inferior Ni	
3	My number one advice would be to work on your intellectual and mental side of life. With that said, here are things you and all people should do, let alone ESTPs... \n\nRead, meditate, study hard or work on business opportunities, work on efficiency, find useful hobbies such as cooking, find the right physical activities for you (lifting/fighting I find most useful for both physical and mental state), and of course don't forget your social life, go out or hang with friends (women! if ur a guy) when you have free time. 
3	Do you guys turn into someome else( unhealthy infj ) during depressive / dark episodes of being in the grip of Ni	
5	There have been some depressing times where a series of bad superstitions kicked in. Does that count?
1	[deleted]
6	Do estp deal with low self confidence and social anxiety because of tertiary Fe.	
6	Sometimes self esteem can drop if no discernible positive feedback is received following an action. Not sure if this is particularly due to tert Fe or what. 
4	Ha try being istp
3	Tertiary Fe means ESTPs are not good at receiving, understanding and navigating the emotions of others. Yes it is very healthy for ESTPs to develop their Fe, it balances out their sometimes overly forceful and rational way of perceiving the world. \nFe is empathy and a connection to something greater other than themselves. \n
5	Using Se and Ni at the same time. Is it possible?	Am I just really high?\nI feel like when I am really relaxed like when I'm stoned, and I get to use those Ni introspective juices flowing through me and I combine that with a Se activity like sports or something I get this really satisfying almost euphoric ability where I can almost visualize my kinesthetic ability and perform really highly. Or am I just too high?
3	I've definitely had this. It even happens with conversations, it's almost like I'm watching myself from the outside while being perfectly aware of everything I'm doing, as if I were choreographing it the whole way through. And I don't use drugs, so I can safely say that's not it.
3	Meng, I think you need to get off the acid
1	Yes, I think so. I see it happen with an ESTP and they come off as a creative genius to me. That's interesting because when I have Se join in on my Ni, it feels like I'm in a dream, like I'm actualizing my dreams. I feel adrenaline pumping through me, my heart starts beating faster, and it's overwhelming-- like, I can do this. This is completely possible.
6	What’s your job and why do you like/do it?	
2	I'm in school right now so I haven't started doing any jobs that have to do with my degree, but I've done similar things and I love learning about my degree. I'm studying kinesiology, and want to do biomechanics or bioengineering. I'm also open to teaching and coaching, which I have done, and I loved that\n\n\nOtherwise I enjoy working with my hands and a relatively dynamic workplace environment. I enjoyed the military, and I've been looking into a lot of blue collar careers recently 
2	HR IT, I like the problem solving part 
1	I haven't started my career yet since I'm still in school, but I do work in retail. Its cool, most of my fellow employees are nice and the pay is good.
1	Dietitian (Nutritionist) for a public health org.\n\nI started out wanting to be a food anthropologist like Anthony Bourdian, travel the world, eat cultural foods, etc. but then reality set in and I chose a career that will always be in demand with decently good pay. Although I work in a heavy bureaucratic job, I like the structure it provides and I can bounce wildly with my plans within those parameters. I like knowing the rules so I can find ways to make things more efficient or know how far I can push the envelope before my boss starts pumping the breaks.\n\n\nPros- Get paid to think about food all day and help others find tasty food that won’t kill them.                                           \n-          Get to create empowering health messages and graphics.                          \n-          Theres always a ‘fire burning’ and my action-oriented thinking gets the ball rolling.                                           \n-          It’s a health center, so lunch walks or happy hour 5ks are encouraged by management- this helps me from getting burned out from being behind a computer all day.         \n-          Standing desks <3\n\n\nCons- constantly thinking about food.       \n-          Congress, legislations & policies
8	Does anyone else sometimes think that people expect us to be either "fun" or "smart" and don't give room to be both?	Basically title, it sometimes seems like a lot of my friends see either goofy clown joker or rational analyst and decide that I'm one of those things or the other.
7	No
3	I don't know if it's just me but this sometimes seems to just be an extroverted perceiver problem in general, maybe it's different for different ones though because for me people seem to draw the line between idea person and nice person so the details or particulars might be different
3	Yeah, I was the “smart kid” in my school (shit school obviously) but I started to get a reputation for fucking around a lot and being funny so by the time I was in high school I had that reputation. Some people who don’t get that jokes can wear out would try to get me to murder comedy by having me repeating jokes and shit over and over again while others tried to get me to help them with projects. My best friends would be the ones to let me be smart and fun at the same time, so it’s a good litmus test, I guess.
2	Nah, I feel like people know I'm a decent balance of both 
1	I think my everyday fun and my smarts work together for the most part
1	I feel like my close friends know I’m both, but in terms of impressions I’m pretty sure people think I’m either or. In class and work/academics related situations I feel like people think I’m robotic, and in other situations I feel that people think I’m a total idiot. It’s hard coming across as extroverted without coming across as dumb though from what I’ve noticed 
2	Do you micromanage when working with others?	
9	If you're being micromanaged by an ESTP, either its some kind of extreme pressure situation, or you're a so bad you're a liability
7	I don't think we micromanage. But if work isn't satisfactory, we're likely to pick up the work and do everything ourselves.  
3	No, but I wish I had the patience and discipline to micromanage people. It always feels like I'm working with stupid people that are incompetent, so I can get condescending with others. I'm working on balancing between being nice but also motivating enough so people get shit done. 
2	Same thing as gravitre on a project, but in a perfect world, everyone would just do what I say since I tend to be good at doing stuff alone, meaning if I have to succeed as team leader, I’d rather have the team be an extension of my own abilities rather than a complex and clunky system of personalities. Teams are able to do a *slightly* higher max workload than I am, but I feel like it’s not a worthy trade when it goes way slower with other people weighing it down by being below the average competency line of the team. I try to be nice and calm as possible, but I try to put myself in a position where I do most of the work overall, filling in the rest of everyone’s shit to do when I’m done.
1	No. I don’t think the value added to the end result is worth the time and aggravation 
1	Not at all.. I want to learn how to micromanage like an ESTJ but I always get bored or stop caring or feel annoyingly overbearing 
15	What's the last thing you created?	I know we're 'good with our hands' and are busy bodies compared to other types. Have you built or created anything lately (or have an on going project)? to make something more efficient? or direct?  Or out of boredom?\n\nThis thought came up as I was watering plants this weekend. On a good day it takes about 20min going around to all the beds. It's a complete time waster when trying to get ready for work. I made an irrigation system for my garden within a few hours. My SO is shocked that it didn't take long and I didn't seem to plan it out. All it took was a 2 garden hoses, knife, and mulch to make it. Now I just turn the hose on and go back inside and wait 20 minutes. #ReclaimingMyTime.\n\n It's not fancy or expensive, but useful AF.
8	Not necessarily making things but I've made several processes at work faster. I'm not really a creator in the physical sense of making things but I get ideas for different approaches to stuff sometimes and attack them as my creative outlet\n\n\n\nOh on subnautica I made a huge base that looked like a dick so that's nice 
4	I've recently started a business and created a neighborhood community garden-so I guess that gives me my creative outlet. Not very creative with my hands generally
5	I built some Gunpla kits a while ago, and built some new shelves at work
3	Made a small electronics toolbox from an old medical kit box with inner compartments.
1	Hmm, I made a coffee table, bedside table, 2 barstools, and patio table one day when my amazon shipment came thru. This was about 8 months ago
7	How do you stay positive?	When you are feeling too emotional or down, unlike your typical ESTP self, what is your outlet to get back to normal?  \n\nI love being carefree and fun, but lately I keep getting in dramatic emotional pits that are unlike me. Does this happen often to ESTPs? 
5	I always think about people who have had a harder time than me and had more serious problems. I have finals now and whenever I think my life is hard I think about the boys of my age who were fighting a war and saw their friends die in front of them.\n\nHelps me put things in perspective and not feel sorry for myself. I'm a male though, so perhaps you will relate more if you think about women through history who had it rough, or someone you look up to. I always like thinking about JFK and Churchill (both ESTPs btw) during their most difficult times like the Cuba Missile Crisis or when GB was under siege.
4	I distract myself with friends, or activities that takes me completely out of emotionally down times. But I feel the inner anxiety deep down from doing that for too long. Gotta be sad every once in a while 
3	I just kinda get over it. Go on with my life and it'll resolve itself. That kinda didn't work as well as I thought it did though, and sometimes it catches up to you so maybe that's what's going on with you as well 
3	I think about what I have/can gained/achieve by going through the situation that caused the emotional letdown and, for the latter case, go about making the achievement. This helps offset my feeling of being at total loss and helps me stay positive. 
2	Honestly I just deal with it. I talk with people I know won't judge or belittle me for my issues or if it is serious enough I seek professional help. If I can't speak with someone I'll just take a walk or stretch just something physical to help me get back into my right state of mind. And some times I just eat something nice and watch a good movie or whatever I can do to help me get out of the stupor I'm in. In my experience it is better to just deal with the issues instead of bottling them up or out right ignoring them.   
1	Like all thr estp's here, distance myself and come back when I'm ready. Or just deal with it.
18	Dead /r/ESTP was better than constant trash /r/ESTP, change my view	
11	I don't know if we are being invaded by trolls, or people who are just awful at typing, and are trying to patronize all ESTPs by portraying an unhealthy version of an ESTP, but this sub was so much fucking better dead than alive. I would rather take a dead sub with limited conversations than this trash. 
9	I assumed there was a unspoken understanding we don't feed trolls attention.  I'm surprised they got any traction.
8	Seriously. \nSome of the recent posts here would find themselves more at home at /r/shittyMBTI
5	Totally agree. Most of the threads on here make me embarrassed to identify with ESTP if it means that I'm like those guys
6	Hi! I know I’m not an ESTP, but I feel sorry for how much your subreddit has been an awful experience. :(  It sucks to have any kind of trolls or be put in a position that you have to feel bad about your mbti type for negative associations.\n\nIf it makes you feel better, I’m always reading how people don’t like ENFJs. And I’m just putting that nicely... there are people who hate ENFJs. (We’re not even that common, I don’t know how people find other ENFJs)Anyway.— it makes me sad because my whole life has revolved around having morals that I live by to treat every person with a higher standard of decency and to actively work towards loving and understanding even the most difficult of people I struggle with.\n\nYou ESTPs are so cool!! I have a good friend who is an ESTP and he really is a sweet, caring, and deeper than most people realize. He loves his action and he is amazingly efficient. More people should notice those special things about you!!\nI wanted to give you love. :)\n\nTo be honest, people are not looking to nurture a healthy community on Reddit. I think people just speak freely, and probably more so than what would be appropriate in real life. It would be hard to keep the unwanted stuff out of a subreddit, but there may be a good approach for what you’re looking for. I would be happy to lend some positive support. :)
3	You're not wrong.
3	I agree with you. I've seen a lot of non-estps trying to stir shit up here. Too bad their posts can't be interesting
1	What would it take to make this subreddit good??
1	Kind of interesting same thing happened in ESTP facebook group - too many other types posting, too many irrelevant or trashy posts of no substance, and too little quality control of content as ESTPs are too freedom loving. It led some ESTPs to retype themselves into ISTPs, or at least play with the notion, so that they could escape their own group.
0	ESTP or nah?	
1	Yes or no mate
1	What
1	Yup, he is.
1	Nice tits.\n\nIt’s a compliment...
0	Fuck y'all I'm the best ESTP 😎	
12	Whatever helps you sleep at night.
5	K?
7	Whatever you say baby 
6	Who are the ESTPs?	
2	Eh.. sounds like a mix of ExTJ, ESTP and this guy building a theory of all ESTPs off his ESTP\-ENTP interactions.

9	Why do most of the ESTPs I know pull this face when I say something random?	
5	That right there is the T in ESTP. 
5	My bf(estp) doesn't. He just pretends to not hear me. 
2	Cause you said something weird as fuck 
1	Totally unexpectedq

5	What's your stress reaction like?	I have dermatillomania, so my main go-to is skin picking, I do it on my fingers. From my understanding, it comes from a lack of like an actual better mental way to cope with stress (since I'm not an addict of any kind) but I'm no psychologist. If I'm being overwhelmed then I can get frustrated, but otherwise that's about it from the top of my head. Maybe other answers will remind me of other stuff
9	Mentally detach or walk away from everything and wait it out
6	I tend to be very impatient and unkind in general
3	before developing NI \- keep  going toward stimulating things like extraversion drugs / women  and ignore the cause of stress\n\nafter developing NI\- isolate and gather myself and all the information SE Took in and acknowledge the stress to create and organise the information using NI
3	Road rage.
2	Either stand completely still and stare at the ground or pace/walk myself. Thinking and weighing up my options. Generally I don't get stressed for long as i find a solution or just give up or procrastinate. If I'm facing the problem directly I just get impatient or angry (if I'm at work I rush things and throw stuff around if they are in my way)
1	Cracking knuckles. Tearing tissue/paper towel into pieces and rolling/compressing into balls. 
0	I yell at people who pressure me whilst I’m stressed. \n\nGetting stressed is VERY RARE for me....although, I still yell at people.
3	What are relationship killers?	
15	Lack of communication, lack of trust, lack of personal boundaries, and lack of commitment. You must master all four to ~~become the avatar~~ hold a decent relationship, and so does the other person. 
4	Trying to act like my mom
5	Intense mental investigation. 
2	Insecurity and trying to find a reason behind every action of mine
1	Determining friends, getting bored
1	Close minded, stupid and boring 
1	lack of trust.
1	Bad sex
9	Commiting to anything is really a struggle for you?	Hi, INTJ here with an ESTP classmate who seems rather contradictory in behavior. Some days i get the impression that she try really hard on life to attain what she think is important, like waking up at 5am to get on class at 8. But Sometimes she will skip classes just to be hanging around with another guys and act like don't give a fuck about me or the college program just to come back asking for help whenever she got a problem with a project or something and i end up always saving her ass. So i would like to know if this devil may care atitude it's something you guys fight everyday cause i know that sometimes i can be sturbborn too and need someone to do things for me or she is just using me and i am wasting my time trying to help? Maybe you guys don't like to be pinned down like this but i need a resolution because she demolishes me literally. Sorry for any typos, not a native.
5	People who have a crush tend to overanalyze everything involved with their crush. She probably just doesn't care as much about you as you do about her. Have you even tried to make a move on her instead of trying to "understand her"? Will give you a much better feeling of where you stand instead of analyzing all the time. \n\nYou are not in a relationship with her, you don't need to understand her and care about the little things she does. First of all, you need to take action. Without the initial action all your analysis is completely worthless and won't get you anywhere.
6	We weren't made to be caged and given loads of paperwork to do. We are social and thrive in the real work actually doing things and solving problems in real life.\n\nWe get information first hand, not by reading about it. We solve problems now, not do homework about how others have solved them. \n\nI'm guessing she means well it's just not her style to do things like that. Trade, let her handle things for you she is great at and you do what you're good at. 
1	Yes. Absolutely. I feel I have no strength to do anything really. Haven’t for the past year or so. It’s only gotten worse and nothing gives me motivation to want to do anything. Nothing is worth putting in the effort
1	ESTP here and I struggle with the devil may care attitude. I use struggle loosely because it helps me out a lot, like when everyone is stressing I generally don't care but the thing is when there are real things that I should care about (i.e how my boss sees me, social obligations, etc..) I just don't care so it hurts me and I've been in that position where I have had to run for help the last minute...it's not intentional.
0	Kidnap her and put her on a diet of root beer and Cornflakes....it works 75% of the time.\n\nThe other 25% goes insane and duck tapes their airways shut.
5	Estp care and handling guide	Most of the mbti types have one but I can’t find one for ESTPs. Is there one that I’m missing? 
13	You can't handle an estp, that will not go well for anyone involved. Gonna have to change your mindset on this one. 
9	Lol wtf is that? People do that?
3	You're not missing anything. The ESTP guide could link to the INFJ one and just say - It's the opposite.
8	Say they're going to meet to go out and then cancel	One of my pet peeves. 
5	Don’t like that either. Apparently P doesn’t always mean you prefer the unpredictables. 
1	Of us, or you're an ESTP and don't like that
1	Unsure of importance. Either reinforce if you got what it takes or leave it.
1	Doesnt this annoy everyone?
3	Commonalities of being friends with an ESTP	I'm an INTJ and one of my best friends is an ESTP. My first question is do any of you guys have an INTJ friend? If so what is the good/bad about it? If not, how would you say it is being friends with an ESTP from your objective perspective? 
2	I’m an ESTP and great friends with two INTJ. They’re both very smart and rational. They give great logical advice. Based on my interactions with them, I’d say the two types go together well as companions. So long as each party lets the other be himself/herself 
1	I do. Well, I’m xSTP. But I have 2 good INTJ friends. In fact, I tend to attract them. Well, NTs in general. \n\nBut - they see my blind spots and they point out things I don’t want to see BUT it’s something I will initially reject then think about. Like they are really insightful buzzkills. I can appreciate that but not in the moment and a lot of their advice is immediately distasteful but upon inspection - intriguing. So they make me think (later on and they will never get credit, btw) and really? An INTJ xSTP dynamic if turned bad would be really evil. Lol 
1	Ugh, my crush that I'm having a really difficult time being with/without is an INTJ\n\nThe reason why we aren't together is because he is really strict in life and I'm not. We are the complete opposites almost and yet we get each other. So weird
1	2 of my best friends are INTJ's. \n\nMost of our friends are NF types- so it's nice when we're all together and can talk more intellectually and mentally spar a bit\n\nWe debate often for fun (which our NF friends don't understand), \nSeems like we feed off each others energy and it spices things up a bit
1	Friends with an intp at work. He shares my fondness of sarcasm but he can’t see why anyone would want to go outside. That part blows my mind. 
3	Study of 300,486 individuals identifies 148 independent genetic loci influencing general cognitive function	
8	Not committing to plans till the last minute	hey homies. Just got chewed out by one of my ExxJ friends of 3 years and basically was called out on the fact that I "won't commit to plans 2-4 days out", but at the same time, if it's with someone new I'll "have something all ready planned with new person". I agree with this - I love focusing on new people and can often lose my focus on people and friends I'm all ready comfortable with until I'm done figuring out the new person.\n\nMy argument is that I honestly have no idea what I'm going to be doing 1,2, shit - 3's aggressive, days from now; sure your plan sounds interesting, but what if something better comes up? I'll include you, but I like to keep my options open and plus, I don't know how I'm feeling till that moment on if I'd like to do said plan. The focusing on new people is true and probably not the best quality, but I LOVE meeting new people!\n\nCurious if this is a common trait among us. How do you handle committing to plans you're not 100% sure about? As well as friends getting angry over you focusing on new people from time to time?
5	If it's just hanging out or some party, I will keep my options open and decide on the spot. Just like you I also like to change groups, even if I have one group of really close friends I will always return to. If it are serious plans like a trip or something... you gotta commit. If you don't you're just an asshole. \n\nBut yeah I would say your friends are mostly jealous.
3	This is why I love my ESTP bro, neither of us give a fuck about planning to meet up, we dont speak for months, and then we're like yo you wanna talk in like an hour, and its all good, other types hate this. This is the best part about our relationship, we don't care about not committing to plans till the last minute, in fact, thats how we both prefer it 😂
3	True. Find this even harder if they keep going over the details of what will happen at said event. All interest gone if the planning is over organized, sucks the fun out of things. I don't plan that much and end up having a better time than most anyway. Agree on the old vs new people. Old friends have their same lives, what else am I supposed to discover? Good thing they understand my need to explore and are cool with it. Also if the people I'm with aren't active but couch potatoes or a little dumb I'm out of there asap. I like to do and learn things, some get pissed off because I dont want to veg out on couch watching endless Netflix with them. I want to go somewhere and do stuff. 
2	I'm the same way. I tell them explicitly tentatively yes if I might be able to, and be sure they know it's subject to change \n\n\nI also do the thing where I focus on new people. A lot of jealousy comes out of that 
2	I try to schedule different friends for different times. I have a group of friends that likes to get together in the late morning and hang out til mid afternoon, and another group of friends that likes to chill from mid afternoon to night. I try to fit new people in to different days altogether. 
2	Curious passerby	I’ve recently encountered an interesting ESTP, kinda got addicted to the attention from them. \nHaving researched the type, they consider themselves to be a sociopath. I knew it wouldn’t last given the nature of the type. No offence. \n\nAnyways, I was curious about you guys and your encounters or associations with INTPs. I just want some metadata to think over. \n\nHope you can help\n\nYour friendly neighbourhood INTP~
6	I don't consider myself a sociopath lmao
1	Are you that insecure? \n\nDon't think I would get along with most INTPs. However, as an intellectual ESTP I think I would occasionally enjoy their company for a short time period. 
4	Any reason why the ENTPs have raided this subreddit these last few days?	Just something I’ve noticed…and that’s not a bad thing. Both ESTPs and ENTPs are my favorite types after all. Sincerely, an INFJ. 😂 
7	Who knows? Nothing remotely interesting gets posted here, not that I have anything to contribute nor want to
1	I highly doubt that!\n\n
1	"the ENTPs"? It's really just that one guy
1	Hi.... INTP here.... fellow ESTPs. \n\nI’m only here for observation reasons. \nThey’re very good reasons. 
1	Hi, ESTPs. I just wanna say that I’ve been permanently band from MBTI subreddit and the INFP subreddit (long story) and I’ve been banned for seven days in my own home of the ENTP subreddit.	I should mention this all happened in less than a day...
25	Oh boy, you sound like *just* the person we want around here
7	Go outside.
3	How the he'll did you manage that?
2	How the hell did you manage that?
2	[deleted]
1	Can you explain how this happened for reals? I just don’t understand how you can get banned on Reddit. 
1	I had an ESTP Friend who was obsessed with his cat!\n\nFunny Story: I hot glued the cats ears down and hot glued his tail down.
1	You guys are fine with insulting each other right?
2	MBTI survey results!! - What did the correlations from 1200 answers say?	
15	How do you deal with not knowing what you want?	To start, I'm convinced I can achieve and get anything I want no matter the obstacles and confidence has never really been a problem in that area. However I always seem to struggle with knowing what I **want** which often leads me to feeling lost in life and then I never seem to do anything at all. I read somewhere that has something to do with our low Ni? Idk?  I'd really like to get over that as I feel at my best when I'm doing/conquering things. I just need to know what do I want. And also I detest doing something just for the purpose of doing it, it has to make sense, you know? Can you relate at all and if you do, how do you deal with this?
8	Relatable. I find interest in A LOT of things. Can’t keep it for too long though.\n\nI tend to have a lot of diverse interest that keep me occupied. If one gets more boring I switch to another but I find myself balancing 100 things instead of being 100% into any one thing. 
5	I totally get this my man! I hear people say, “Well doing something is better than nothing”. Sometimes they say that in a “I know best” way. Like fuck off that’s not always right dipshit. But I digress. Just doing something for no reason is not good enough l. It’s empty and meaningless and I have no motivation cuz there’s no means to this end!!! 
5	Some good advice that an ENTJ friend gave is to try a lot of things if you don't know exactly what you want. In process of trying out these different things you'll find some that are more interesting and others that will bore you, some where you excel and possibly have a future ahead of you, and others that are not the best application of your capabilities and talents. Worst thing you can do is to try nothing and keep wasting time. This is the path this ENTJ guy has followed, and after holding like 30+ different kinds of jobs, gaining experience and skills and testing waters, he finally started his own business in his mid-40s and now he is doing what he enjoys that is also making him a lot of money.
1	Can I please ask some ESTPs to elaborate on this? \n\nI broke up with an Estp because of exactly this- he is grown (in his late 40s) but has never seemed to figure out how to set priorities and live in alignment with them. \n\nI felt like he was using me and was inconsiderate because he didn’t value me. So I ended things— he didn’t take it well, which was very confusing. I’m trying to be less confused. Would appreciate help. 
1	Your thoughts about people hurting you after you became vulnerable sounds like him too. His dad was abusive and he wasn’t allowed to be himself growing up. He was the child of immigrants and they just wanted him to excel and live according to their native cultural standards of excellence. So they crushed his sense of self. He had to fight to make space for himself, which is why I think he doesn’t like anything encroaching on his freedom now. His self is fragile and so the demands of others will easily overwhelm him. He has a harder time saying ‘no’ than one would think an ESTP would, so he avoids closeness so he’s not letting people down. \n\nI think this was why he liked me— I held space for him to be him, and to be vulnerable as he figured things out about himself.  I’m very protective of those I care about in this way. It just seemed like every time we were together and felt closer to each other, he would then do something that was exactly what he knew would unduly push my boundaries. Like cancelling dinner plans at the last minute for work and then wanting to come over later after going out with others (I shut that down). Or sadly continuing to try to not use protection in bed, but repeatedly saying he didn’t want kids. Then he would never call me- just wait for me to call him. \n\nI still miss him a lot- he didn’t seem to understand why I liked him. But I was totally in love with him. It felt like we had always known each other.  But his actions put me at odds with my self worth, and that’s not ok. \n\nDo you have anxiety when you separate from someone you care about? \nHow do you deal with the desire to push boundaries and the impact of this on other people? \n

2	Which is meant to be which?
5	ISFPs why...	Why does the isfp exist? Just talking to them magically drains me of any small amount of motivation I have in life. Anyone know people of this strange and infuriating type?
4	ISFP is the "supervisor" type of ESTP, while ESTP is the "supervisee" of ISFP. Supervisors will drain you out of energy, so they are best in small doses, couple hours of hanging out here and there 1-2 times a week. If you spend more than half a day with them they'll zap you out of energy and to recharge you'll have to distance from them. Nevertheless ESTPs keep chasing after ISFPs because supervisees are usually attracted to their supervisors and put them on a pedestal as a kind of superior person, for which reason many ESTP men end up dating and even marrying ISFP women. The way cognitive functions work between ISFPs and ESTPs, the ISFP cannot hear the arguments of ESTP so much of what ESTP says flies past them, while the ESTP hears and reacts to every little thing the ISFP says or does. Hence why these are called "asymmetric" relations - the ISFP has much stronger effect on ESTP while the ESTP is powerless before them.   \n    \nThis is the entire description of [**supervision relations**](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/78-Supervision-relations) and [relationship layout for ESTPs with other types](http://personalitycafe.com/estp-articles/289-love-types-estp-5.html#post10023554).   \n    \nP.S. ISFPs have a completely different effect on ISTPs. ISTP supervisor type is the ENTP which is very different from ISFP. This is actually one way to check one's type: if ISFPs are truly one's supervisor type then that's evidence for being a bona fide ESTP, if not - then definitely some other type mistyping as ESTP.   \nP. S. S. more about ESTP's Fi PoLR which is dominant function of ISFP added below

1	One of my best friends is an ISFP. (I'm an ISTP). What do you want to know?
2	In love with an estp	Test
13	[deleted]
9	Clearly every case varies person by person imo. \n\nESTPs are amazing lovers and they can be great partners too. \n\nIf you quit being “superavailable,” he will find a way to be with you if he cares to. You can’t force anything. \n\nYou might realize he doesn’t care about you nearly as much as you care about him. If that’s the case, respect yourself and leave. ESTPs will take advantage of your loyalty/love if you let them. 
8	Stop thinking about what you think you should be, and just do you. Generic advice, I know, but if you change yourself he can't know you, and if he can't know you, he can't love you. \n\n> What does he want\n\nHe doesnt even know, but if he wants you he'll tell you. And if he's anything like me, he'll tell you exactly what he wants from you. If he doesn't want what you want, then there's nothing you can do. \n\nNi is very stubborn. I've seen a lot of my Ne friends in denial that they can change an Ni user's mind, you can't. He wants what he wants, but he probably doesn't know what he wants yet. \n\nAll you can do is be completely real and see if he wants you. It really isn't up to you or him, it just is or isn't. But if you want it, you've gotta give it a shot.\n\nEdit: and keep in mind, ENTPs and ESTPs are strong, opposed forces. ENTPs are always in the future preserving the past with Ne-Si, ESTPs are always in the now changing the future. Both good, but very different life approaches. In my experience, enxps are great friends, but when it comes to going deeper, it's hard for them to sacrifice their internal perceptions, because really you can't. You could come to terms with it, but love won't be easy.
6	I mean don't annoy him. He'll get back to you on his own time 
3	As an entp female who's dated a few ESTPs when young and foolish  (because we have similar energies and openness and attract each other, that's true) the best advise I can give you is ignore whatever he says and look at how he behaves in the big picture. If he ignores you, he's not that into you. If he goes out of his way to do stuff for you, it means something. It's that simple with them. Bask in the sweet talking bouts, but don't let them fool you. If they don't fit his general attitude, it's bs. And oh do they love bs. It's not even malevolent, it's quite honest actually, but it's in the moment thing unless (again) all the rest adds up. Use this as an opportunity to sharpen that Ti. Oh and fuck his brains of course. 
2	Hey, here is the first step you need to do 1) stop and breathe ok. You are putting out some strong vibes dial it back a bit. Just do you and if the guy is interested in what you are selling he'll come back, and if not move on.

1	Yea no thanks lol
15	The Vice and Virtue of ESTPs. Apparently. Do you agree?	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwtDLxnVd0c\n\nSo there has been some talk about this guy in the MBTI forum and I guess he makes some interesting points. I personally agree with him more than I initially wanted to. What do you guys think?
8	Hesitant but yeah he's pretty on point \n\n\nWhere the fuck is he going 
8	That's scary accurate...
6	Really impressed at this. At times I wonder if I’ve taken the Myers Briggs test accurately. There’s self bias that can alter your answers so that your results are who you think you are, not always who you actually are. I can fully confirm that I’m an ESTP now lol \n\n

2	That’s super accurate... I’m an estp who met my wife at 19 and I have not looked back... before I met her I had gone on dates w/ numerous girls in high school and college. I had a bit of a reputation to say the least but now I would never dream of cheating on her! That vid is really accurate but the guy is pretty annoying in his voice, repetitiveness, and mannerisms...
2	His estp profile video is also very good, definitely check it out. Not all of the other type videos he does are great. Like I wanted to share the ISTJ one with my ISTJ mom, but it's just so biased and bad. So be skeptical with his other stuff if you watch it.
2	Too annoying for me to watch the whole thing- but after 10 minutes I decided it didn’t resonate at all with me. I’m definitely an ESTP, but not that kind of ESTP. 
1	Ha...that guy looks like a basic avatar you’d have in a RPG...
5	Would an ESTP avoid you to test how loyal you are, or to test how badly you actually want them in your life?	I have read somewhere that ESTPs might play games like that, kinda pressing bottons, to reveal someone's true person. Is this true? \nAnd what are some signs that an ESTP is doing this to me? \nEspecially ignoring and treating me differently than before. O\nr is it just that the ESTP does no longer like me? \nI don't understand, help!
8	Unlikely. I think you’re over analyzing their behavior. 
4	I only do this when I'm paranoid of a guy's intentions who I want to date. I don't do this to people I consider friends. 
4	I won’t care enough to do this ever. If I want to see you, I will. If I think you’re not being loyal, I’ll address it. 
3	That is something an ESTP generally would *never* do. ESTPs, in fact, *hate* it when they observe that in someone. What you see in an ESTP is I would argue *exactly* what you get.
2	Nah
1	I would, but I have extremely strong Ti for an ESTP.
1	I judge the fuck out of everyone and test them to see if my judgement is right.\n\nI'll do this until I consider you a friend.\n\nYou probably won't know 
6	Just dropped by to say HI! to all my shadows.	INFJ here...
3	Hi
3	Yeehaw 
2	Yo
2	Whats good
1	You should only have one shadow....unless you’ve a Siamese twin....🤣👌
11	How are y'all doing?	Just checking to see how y'all been and all that good shit 
9	Going to EDC in 2 weeks so cracking down on my exercise so I can hot it up in those slutty raver slut-ware outfits!!! 
5	Doing great! Just finished my first year of college and am about to head home for the summer. Kinda sad not only because I'm leaving my friends, but because of the lack of stimulation I'll have back at home.\n\nBut, as with us ESTPs, I know I'll find something to do. My summer will probably be full of work, going to the gym, taking summer classes, going on vacations, and hanging with friends/the GF. \n\nBut more importantly, how are you doing?
4	Pretty shitty. Trying to get on wellbutrin \n\n\nOne more semester boys, one more. Then grad school application grind 
3	Everyone in my friends group loves me and they will host a big party at the end of the semester. I have FOMO and would like to hook up with this one girl in the group. Sadly she ignored my text earlier this week and its been bothering me ever since \(I negged her instead of just normal teasing\). The rest of summer is going to be boring without the constant social interaction. I feel like my ESTP side really shot up after I quit masturbation and put myself out there to socialize. Video games and movies bore me more than it used to. Also have trouble with my arrogance. People compliment my dress sense and I would always say that i dress well.
3	hey thanks for looking out for us! how have you been? all good in life?
2	Trying to figure out how to navigate waters at work... bunch of ESFJ's and ESTJ's and their politics/drama. Blah. All good despite that. :) How you doin'? Giggity
2	Good. Weathers finally warmed up enough for me to start planning summer motorbike trip. 
10	Any ESTPs mistyped as INFJ/INFP during bad time in life?	Whenever I took an online mbti test, I'd always get either INFJ or INFP. And during these times, I was going through a lot of hard times, depression, feeling lost, you name it. I read somewhere online that ESTPs can become unhealthy INFJs or revert to their shadow functions as an unhealthy version of an INFJ? Has anyone else had similar experience? And what were some ways you got out of that shadow function?
8	[deleted]
6	I know 2 ESTPs who mistyped as INFJs and went on believing it for years. Both eventually discovered their type after trying to socialize with NFs and seeing how they don't really fit in with them.
6	Oh this is me \nI used to type as INFP back when I had a lot of self doubt  but now I type as ESTP. \n\n
5	I was an ISTP until the end of college. I stopped masturbating and began socialising more and more. Alcohol really helped bring our the real me and had no problems introducing myself to new people
3	I typed INTP/ISTP. Because I wanted/had to isolate myself from the bs
3	Nope, even down and out I type ESTP
2	First tested as an INFJ. Didn’t know then how the functions worked, or that they were even a thing. Was also extremely sheltered growing up.
1	I was an estp my entire life untill I got into my early 20s which is when I met an intp who I considered as my mentor and my intj bestfriend along with my isfp gf meeting these introverted people tempted me to develop my introverted  side since it was so bad compared to theirs,  also during this period I was under extreme stress due to my parents marriage breaking off and getting seperated and at the same time I  also got into the habit of smoking weed everyday  whish isolated me further from the external world and my friends . The stress in my life that I was trying to avoid along with the habit of smoking weed led to me snapping my mind on one fine day where my inferior Ni got the best of me and I was taken over by it fully. For us estps the inferior Ni presents itself in the form our subconscious INFJ personality and the subconscious mind is not something we have conscious control over so it was by default negatively wired and was extremely dark to navigate this inner landscape(Ni) for me and it led to full blown depression where the Ni had complete control over me and every action and thought which  also led to anxiety , psychosis and paranoia that was totally not experienced by me earlier in my life due to our SE  taking the bull by its horn always  . It was completely crippling to an extent where I started believing that I am an INFJ and my life is going to  horrible always , but I had the fighting spirit  to fight irrespective of how bad my situation was or how deep I was in the Ni rabbit hole . I finally had to develop my Ni and Fe to come out of  the rabbit hole along with other fucntions like fi and ne , it was extremely painful but coming out of it seems it  was  totally worth it and I  seem like a totally different person now compared to who I was when I went it. It also helped me to understand introverts instead of finding them weird but I still think they are a pain in the ass sometimes with their subjective world and close mindedness especially (IXXJs)  One thing that I learnt from this is the fighting spirit we estps have and the ability to kick and fight our way out of any horrible situation we are put in .
9	How to tell a teenage ESTP that his friends aren't true friends?	I am an INFJ, 16. He is an ESTP, 14.\n\nI always wanted to be his friend, but stayed far because I thought he wouldn't really care and see me as a friend because he had lots of friends. \n\nHowever, we had a school trip out of the country and I saw that all his friends aren't actually friends. He got sick during the trip and was tierd but none seem to care, and I felt I was his friend when I am not but because I was the only one feeling his pain and taking care of him. \n\nPlus, his friends are toxic, they don't really see him as a true friend and they are the reason of bad behaviors he had developed, eg smoking. And I want to help and guide him.\n\nDuring the trip one night, the ESTP was sad, and I saw one of his friends offering him cigarettes to, what smokers believe, make you feel better. \n\nAnd one night we were camping, I shared tent with him, and our tent was next to two of his friends (one of them is the one who offered cigarettes), he was really sick and tired and needed to sleep. They were making noise and so himself and I weren't able to sleep. He asked them multiple times to be quit yet they didn't care, I got so mad and went and fought with them verbally so they would shut up or go somewhere else so he (and I) woube able to sleep. They moved to somewhere else then, yet they weren't  considering at all the fact their 'friend' is sick. \n\nI was the only one who took him to a pharmacy and make sure he drinks water and eats, whilst the others didn't care at all on how miserable their 'friend' was, especially the sadness he must had to getting sick on a fun trip.\n\nAfter the trip, I talked to my ENTP classmate, the only one I trust, and he told me that long ago he had told the ESTP that his friends aren't friends but the ESTP said something like "they are fine as long as they are not hurting me", the ENTP told me that later on the 'friends' of the ESTP spread rumors about him, and they had a conflict for 3 months, but than his 'friends' invited him somewhere as if no big deal had happened, and denied their actions.\n\nI kind of see what's going in his ESTP mind. I think he is holding into them because they were friends since very long ago (or he believes they were friends), and so have a past and fun memories with them (Sensors trait?). I know ESTPs has insecurities about their future, and their relationships not lasting, meanwhile this ESTP is going to his fears himself and is going to have himself hurt. And as I understood by the ENTP, is that the ESTP wouldn't stop friending them because then he wouldn't have friends. The ENTP said that even telling the ESTP the truth of his friend has no solution because that doesn't make the ESTP get real friends. And here, the idea just took over me that I am his solution, to be his true friend. And the other way around, being a friend of him is going to solve my problem of loneliness. And because I already know his friends aren't true friends, this makes it easy for me to get close. \n\nI sent the ESTP an email that I would talk to him. Which It thought would be easy to do, but now, I don't know how I am going to say everything. I want to tell him everything I know about his friends that proves they aren't real, even if I would hurt him, but hurting him right now a little is better than having him get hurt bad later at some point.\n\nEven though I know the ESTP trust me, I don't know how I am supposed to tell him. Also, I don't know if I should say that I would be his friend or that I always wanted to be his friend but stayed away. I know ESTP like things to be told straight forward but, I fear telling him or hinting him that I would be his friend will make him think that I am trying to break his from his friends so I would become a friend of his for something from him.\n\nPlease help me know what and how to tell the ESTP everything. Thank you.\n\n
6	You tell him\n" Hey, I'm concerned about you. I'm not going to control you or stop you but so far I think It's best if you ditch your friends cause theyre toxic and fake " or anything between those lines or something similar to that. Just whatever you do.. don't. drop. hints.. say it directly to avoid confusion. It will worsen if you dont say it directly.\n\nDon't worry bout how he feels that much, most likely he'll let it go in a matter of minutes. Though I'm pretty sure he already knows theyre fake- We have a very good sense on that. Perhaps he's caught on something, in debt? scared to be bullied or left out(from what u said its probably this)? whatever it is, I advise you just let him know that youre genuinely ready to help and that youre a sincere friend. \n\nI can't tell you whats going on in his head since our perspectives on relationships and just everything is different. If you really want to know why or whatsoever just go and ask him and dont be shy, he'll tell.\n\nPlease do call him out on his bullshit.\nESTP's need those kind of people in their lives.\n\nESTP POV: \nit's hard to realize when we're shitty cause we're too into the moment and get completely endulged into it that we get lost and dont realize whats happening. Especially since he's 14, he is very prone to this.\n\nHope this helps, good luck
4	As an Estp, I’ve had my share of fake friends. I knew they were fake from the beginning. Most likely your friend knows too. I have only a few really close friends. The rest are fake... lol
4	Make it clear that you have good intentions but don't be overly patronising. By the sound of how you wrote this post, it seems to me that you have a kind of Messiah complex. Some people just have to figure it out for themselves, and while it's nice to show concern, the amount of time you are putting into this seems a little obsessive.\n\nAs an ESTP myself, I would prefer it if somebody reached out. Try consistently inviting your friend over to other more wholesome activities. Better yet, do so together! Judgement will only produce stubornness. I would personally feel attacked if some person told me my friends were being fake without knowing the full context of things.\n\nLet your friend decide on their own whether or not they want to stick around those guys. They are not your burden to bear.
4	Just remember friendship means different things to different people and there is value in shallow, imperfect friends. It's not surprising that an infj would connect with an estp given you guys have the same functions, but don't impose your idea of friendship on him. True friends don't come to estps for a while sometimes, and that usually has more to do with the estp putting on an Fe facade to fit in than the people he's friends with. When you're getting into this intervention of sorts the person you're actually criticizing is this estp guy not being true to himself, which is fine, just know that going in if you do.
2	Went through the same thing in high school. Let him suffer through it, since he probably won’t get it anyway, but—and this is important—be there for him, especially during those times when it gets real bad. Demonstrate that you take his pain seriously and that you won’t just be dismissive about it. Show him the loyalty that his “friends” had never shown and never will show him.
2	I’m the ENTP in the story. Give me some gratitude!\n\n
5	What are estps like in their late 30s?	Just really curious. What things do you feel have change in you along the years. 
3	I know one ESTP who has turned 41 recently but he's really kind of an outlier and not very typical of his type. He has always had a terrible fear of responsibility and enjoys his freedom, so right now he lives in his car and travels from one metropolitan area to another picking up odd jobs here and there for food and gas money, and his free time is spent going out to bars and clubs, working on his old vehicle, taking trips out to nature, writing short stories and poetry, and visiting his family and friends, and friends and acquaintances in different cities he has many. He has always been a player around women, but he's not very dominant and relies on his wit and charm to keep many attracted. Keeps a circle of women around himself through his travels and social media, where he's like a glistening fish that sparkles its scales at them from a distance. He has had many girlfriends in past, but said that he never felt like he wanted to stay with any of them so he broke off most of these relationships after 2-5 years. Now, like any man hitting 40s, he is finding himself still attracted to 20-something women yet they are not as interested in him, as the 10-15 year gap is harder to bridge and a semi-homeless lifestyle for a 40 y.o. is not that attractive to many women no matter the wit and the charm, so he has complained that it has become harder finding a girlfriend for him now. He still pulls girls in clubs for a night or a short escapade but has more difficulty finding a deeper connection. The inferior Ni has caught up with his personal life.
2	I'm far from 30 but I have a line of ESTP uncles\n(weird cause so far im the first ESTP thats not a guy in my family line and my grandmother confirms that)\n\nWell just like any other theres the "I grew up, I'm respinsibl- no.. and I'm stinking rich" and theres the "I'm shit to my family and in a huge asf debt..did I mention I'm alcoholic?" and the " I havent reached 30 and I'm dead" and ofcourse the "I'm never home and I'm still single, probably fucked in every country"
2	32 M here. Quit work to studie 100% (I want to do it now and understand the end goal better) and watch my kid. Next semester he starts kindergarden and I will take random jobs and studie. \n\nIt was hard to let go of the "gotta make money" mentality. But I am loving it.\n\nAnd since Uni is 8 hour drive (1hour flight) away I get a "holiday" from wife and kid and get to meet new friends.\n\nGuess I will be teaching at late 30. (Norwegian system) either 13-16, 16-18 or a school for 18+(to22ich) where kids pick a fun subjekt and dont get grades (traveling I will make a "East/West: line and go to SE-Asia and New York)\n\nOr I will do something else. But I know that I will stay with my wife (a promise is a promise). If she leaves I will steal my dads sailingboat and learn to sail, and sail around the world or die trying.\n\nTL;DR: do what makes you happy, change work, not family!
2	The IPIP-NEO Short Form	
11	Two ESTPs walk into a bar	
3	I need to see that film, haha
5	Is this the Greatest Showman?
3	What is the ESTP approach to get girls?	What do ESTP's generally do to go after a girl when you see one you like? I read that you guys act bold and make it obvious that you're interested, but I'd like more details. How do you act? What do you think? How long do you take to ask her out? What's your approach & attitude? What's your procedure? 
9	There isn't a procedure. It's read and react, depends on each individual. I don't have a method, I just be myself
3	Talk to them and seem like you know what youre doing and you got your shit together.. really tho.. just do it..it happens when it happens, no need to fuss
3	“Hi”
2	Lol
2	"We finna smash or nah?"
1	Normally I try to talk to them.
1	I'll start talking to her more quietly as though I'm telling secrets 
1	Hotter the girl is more  casual and easier the approach becomes. 
3	Estp or esfp?	I'm pretty sure I'm esxp just not sure of the t/f dichotomy. I'm leaning towards esfp but just wondering people's thought re: the difference, especially for women.
4	Easy, ESFPs are [shit at Ti](https://www.reddit.com/r/estp/comments/7pddiq/suggestion_for_banner/) (no consistency, no building up arguments across multiple comments, answers are independent from the comment tree except the immediate parent) and ESTPs are [shit at Fi](https://www.reddit.com/r/estp/comments/8aprt3/what_are_your_insecurities_estps/dx0v9b5/) (can't see how a person stands in regard to another, are they my friend? enemy? can't tell, better be prepared for the worst).\n\nI doubt you're either. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/8c1kkz/mbti_is_scary/dxc1kct/) show's you're quite good with Fi, but also very focused on how things *should* be. You're basically taking his hand and leading him through the exercise. I doubt any Se-person would be this embellishing. At the same time you're not as averse to Ti.  \nBut tell me, where do you have problems? What do you often complain about? Where would you appreciate some help? What do other people do that annoys you? :)
1	I mean, why are you leaning f?
1	Here's a more detailed round of ESTP/ESFP descriptions, see if anything here sounds like an accurate description for you:  \n   \n[ESTP by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=SLE_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [ESTP by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42478) | [ESTP subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/6796-Two-subtypes-of-SLEs-ESTps-which-one-are-you?p=129978&viewfull=1#post129978)   \n[ESFP by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=SEE_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [ESFP by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42477) | [ESFP subtypes](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=SEE_subtypes)    \n
6	Any way to test if an ESTP or ISTP? The test put me in the middle	I really enjoy being in social situations but usually prefer to listen more than talk. Also in a group effort I usually like to sit back and listen what's the plan and guide the group when I feel like it. I also have no tendencies to create or build something by hands, only music.\n\n"Virtuosos can seem very loyal and steady for a while, but they tend to build up a store of impulsive energy that explodes without warning, taking their interests in bold new directions." - This is also completely false for me. I never have outbursts of emotions, everything that I decide is a result of my thoughts and I consider myself to be a very loyal person to my few closest friends. \n\nSome other keywords: ambitious, think a lot about negative changes in my social circles, good public speaker, enjoy throwing useless shit away, no bullshit/straight to the point, one track mind\n\nEdit: I guess I feel like a low energy ESTP but the official ISTP description doesn't match me.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/KgWkh0f\n\nThoughts?
3	Look at your inferior. Is it Fe or Ni. Are you a selfish narcissistic asshole who always asserts and imposes his personal logic and deductions onto others w.o. much regard for how they might feel about it? No? Then you're not ISTP.\n\nAlso it says here you have friends, so that also effectively rules out ISTP.\n\nIstp here.
3	Try carefully reading through socionics ESTP/ISTP profiles and seeing which ones you identify with. They are more detailed than MBTI ones which makes it easier to settle on type.    \n[ISTP by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=LSI_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [ISTP by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42483) | [ISTP subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/4440-Discussion-of-LSI-ISTj-Subtypes?p=142621&viewfull=1#post142621)    \n[ESTP by Gulenko](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=SLE_Profile_by_Gulenko) | [ESTP by Stratiyevskaya](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/42478) | [ESTP subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/6796-Two-subtypes-of-SLEs-ESTps-which-one-are-you?p=129978&viewfull=1#post129978)   \n
3	Most common places to find estp females	Where would a 6w5 estp female go
5	The gym
3	[deleted]
3	I'm usually eating at a new restaurant, going to winerys/breweries or hiking.
2	Please answer OP so I can avoid those places. ESTP usually kick my ass.
1	Their homes-?\n\nBitch u find them everywhere\nshes probably that really hot chick at the gym \nor that lady you dont like who's always nomming on a subway sandwich 
1	The weirdest places - but enjoying every minute of it. I work in a library, a laundromat, and pet sit. Look for the ones with the odd jobs. We're usually pretty confident. Can be bitchy without trying to be. So, you happen upon us more than you seek us out. We are nowhere normal or particular. \n\nedit: female ESTP here
1	Pornhub....
1	It's sad that these kind of posts never seem to be taken seriously.
1	I am estp female
1	...
7	I can't tell if I'm an S or an N	Everyone at my work was MBTI tested and then required to  perform a self-verification through several exercises. I tested ENTP but self-verified as ESTP, but I'm still not sure.\n\nI have always had a strong "intuition," but what I mean by that word is a physical sensation in my gut or body that lets me know if something is not right. I do prefer to stay present and grounded, but I can't deny that strong intuitive urge that I sometimes get without explanation or facts to back it up. I often find that the facts later reveal themselves. \n\nWhat is meant by intuition and how do you apply it to your ESTP type?
6	You sound like an Estp. I think that’s your Ni speaking. Ne is more conscious.
2	You can be an estp and have a more developed Ni than an INxJ. The order is about preference not quality of your using the function. Like, my Te is pretty damn good, but I just don't see the point in it on a day to day basis that a Te-Fi type would. Also yes, you sound like an stp.
2	Yeah you sound like an sp, the whole gut instinct thing is very se-ni. I think enxp types are more like, thinking of every possible angle to everything always.
27	My thoughts on other types	Fellow ESTPs - thought I'd share my own experiences with other types after having lived with, worked with, and dated lots of different types and see how your own experiences are alike/different from mine. Standard MBTI PSA: I really do believe (almost) any type is compatible from a relationship standpoint depending on emotional maturity, shared interests, and most importantly – understanding of your own shortcomings and needs of your partner, etc. Serious tl;dr warning as well. \n\nAnddd we're off like a prom dress! \n\n\n**ESTJ** - Brother, current and past roommates, a couple coworkers\n\n- Pros: Fun dudes. Always enjoy activities with them and joking around about a bunch of shit. Find myself agreeing with them on a lot of stuff.  Great sense of humor.  Little brother is my best friend.  Work with them is fine and fun when they aren’t taking things too seriously, even if they tend to obsess over random processes that don’t add value for anyone outside of their adrenaline rush for needlessly organizing stuff in Excel (really goes for anything they do in life I’ve found). \n\n- Cons: Every ESTJ I've met NEEDS to be in control of every situation they're in, overly-OCD about dumb stuff, e.g., borrowing something from them is the most formal process ever - if it isn't returned in pristine condition, they get irrationally angry. You haven’t cleaned the dishes on your “turn?” Oof –not good, and better not do it again or they’ll be problems, generally not open to debate about anything, repress feelings and will unleash on you.  Never, ever, do anything to hurt their pride, unless they bring it up themselves first.\n- Relationship potential: Literally last I would date. \n\n**ISTJ** - Dad, current boss, coworkers, girlfriend’s mom\n\n- Pros: Really love their quiet sense of duty, dependability, and will cover for shortcomings of others generally without feeling the need to express it. Often overly organized like ESTJs, but in more of a “this is my stuff, don’t mess with it and all will be well.” Most times I find myself appreciating their recall of…everything they’ve experienced in their lives.  Makes for some good stories, conversations.  Enjoy their sarcasm most of the time.  Great bosses, as long as you don’t mind to be held to the same expectations they hold of themselves and don’t care about work-life balance.\n\n- Cons: ISTJs love the past – in fact, once they experience something even once, that becomes the most important data point to them. Most of their responses in casual conversation is “I remember…” and they really pride themselves on their ability to remember useless shit.  In my dad’s case, I pointed this out to the rest of my family, and we often laugh when his contributions to the conversation have included stuff like: how he lost his 5th grade regional spelling bee championship (his mom pronounced the world swaddle as “swattle,” which clearly through him off), exact dates for stuff like when the AC went out in 1987, etc.  However, find myself clashing with them on certain topics, but in the end not really a huge deal. \n- Relationship potential: Probably not, but not completely out of the question\n\n\n**ESFJ** – Sister, lots of girls I know\n\n- Pros: Genuinely are interested in the well-being of everyone they love.  In fact, in my sister’s case, hurts them if someone is struggling and will do what they can to check-up on you and try to make you feel good.  Easy to talk to them about anything, and from my personal experience it seems like they really appreciate Ti – something I’d say us ESTPs value quite a bit.  Their sense of duty to their family’s happiness is unparalleled.  \n\n- Cons: Even though I enjoy random gossip, they take it to a new level I find kind of pointless (did you see x cousin is moving in with her boyfriend?). Seems like they’re always trying to “prove themselves” to everyone, ESTPs in particular.  Don’t find them bringing too many different viewpoints to the table during conversation, and will incessantly defend others if only to “keep the peace” at the expense of what is really true. VERY materialistic and status focused, always pretend to listen to what you’re saying with interest, but don’t seem to really care.\n\n- Relationship potential: Was seeing an ESFJ girl for a few months. Not serious at all, but found myself bored very quickly.\n\n\n**ENFJ** – A couple girls I know\n\n- Pros: Fun people. Seem to really care about your well-being, and often confident in their own unique way.  Great conversation, strong morals, could talk to them about pretty much anything.  They don’t necessarily bring many thought-provoking views to the conversation, but will definitely add-on to whatever is being talked about.   When alcohol is involved, there won’t be a second of silence. \n\n- Cons: Also materialistic and status focused. Can be way too chatty and gossipy. Seem like a little bit of control freaks.\n\n- Relationship potential: Had a spring break fling with a good friend back in college and was a ton of fun. While I've found ENFJs and I always enjoy each other’s presence and doing fun stuff together, not sure it’d go beyond that.\n\n\n**ESTP** – Me, 2 best guy friends from middle school, female cousin\n\n- Pros: We are actually the most fun people.  We will talk to you about anything, USUALLY not take things too seriously, and add a spark to whatever is currently happening.  The first person you will text – or more likely receive a text from – saying “let’s go do x” and if it sounds fun, the ESTP will always do it.  Witty, confident, and surprisingly loyal to those they care for. Lax about a lot of stuff, will often lend a hand and do appreciate helping people out. Actually wants others to feel good much of the time.  \n\n- Cons: Often immature when it comes to relationships, work, and other important things in life and instead focus on short-term instant gratification.  Many ESTPs appear outwardly confident, but inside are self-conscious, which often manifests itself in the worst way particularly in relationships.  Cocky, and critical of…everything.  Knows how to piss you off, and will.  Their cunningness is a gift to them and often a curse to anyone else.  Will get out of most sticky situations due to a great combination of quickly assessing surroundings, and thinking how to logically manipulate others to believe what they are saying.  Overly hedonistic.\n\n- Relationship potential: Ha. Would be fun for a lot of it, but good luck establishing even a semblance of day to day organization and predictability. \n\n\n**ESFP**: Mom, dated one briefly couple years ago girlfriend’s dad, old-coworker/friend and a few others\n\n- Pros: Are also fun people.  Always see my mom giving the most genuine grin ever during simple things like playing board games with the family.  Refreshingly positive most of the time.  Want things to be fun for everyone and will try to bring out the best in people in the moment.  Casual conversations are extremely enjoyable.   \n\n- Cons: So here’s what I find annoying with immature ESFPs (my mom, in some aspects):  Their “wanting everyone to be happy” mantra sometimes can be deceiving because it’s often used to…make themselves feel good about themselves for being such “caring people.”  Not to say they aren’t, but they will be the most empathetic and supporting people, until they they’re triggered by something you said and all of a sudden that caringness is completely gone until you apologize or they realize they were being overly sensitive (former far more likely). I think many types do this, but their swings are the worst of any of them.  We joke that my mom often tries to engage us in “Forced Family Fun,” because there’s no reason we shouldn’t be having fun at ALL times, right? \n\n- Relationship potential: Long term? No chance. Short term? Yes, and stock up on plenty of booze and condoms before the first date \n\n\n**ISFP:** Adult female I’ve had many serious conversations with, male cousin, uncle \n\n- Pros: Moralistic, caring, aversion to mundane matters – seem to share the disdain for unneeded organization like ESTPs.  Great listeners, emotionally mature, appreciate many of the simple things in life. Can be surprisingly logical for a feeler some of the time.\n\n- Cons: Suffers a bit from the “care and support you until I don’t” syndrome like ESFPs. Very sensitive people. From my standpoint, can be a bit…boring, notwithstanding the shared extraverted sensing stuff we can talk about.\n\n- Relationship potential: I really can’t see this one working – maybe the lowest chance of any feeler.\n\n\n**ISTP**: The only ISTP I have even somewhat of a relationship with is my uncle and ex-girlfriend’s dad. I do watch interviews for a bunch of athletes who clearly are ISTPs.\n\n- Pros: Carefree, the “I don’t give a shit” attitude is refreshing, and something they have above all types – something all types could learn from when faced with stressors that really don’t matter.  Don’t feel the need to people please, and seem to be good at being themselves in all situations.  Confident in a way us ESTPs aren’t.\n\n- Cons: Overly apathetic. Seem to be critical and selfish, and maybe the least likely type to attend to their partner’s needs \n\n- Relationship potential: Female celebrity ISTPs are hot as hell (looking at you Anna Kendrick). Still, can’t see this one working beyond a short-term fling.\n\n\n**ENTJ:** Really close friend, girl I had a 2 week fling with\n\n- Pros: My favorite thinking type. They seem to offer an interesting perspective on stuff and are always open for debate, enjoy being challenged, seem to rarely get defensive – instead opting to explain why you’re wrong. For the first time in my life, saw it was like to be with a female much more confident than me and didn’t put up with any BS – was actually a great learning experience form me. Also enjoy fun activities, loyal, have your back.  Makes me laugh when my ENTJ calls people out, even if it’s me.\n\n- Cons: Tendency to completely disregard emotions when in debates or discussions – and this is coming from someone who often values logic above most everything else.  Often critical to a fault.\nRelationship potential: Would be interesting, but leaning towards know.  Think it’d take a mature and emotionally confident & mature ESTP to make this one work, as well as an understanding ENTJ.\n\n- Relationship potential: Much like in the case of ESTP-ESFJ relationships, I think ESTPs would be trying to "prove themselves" too much to ENTJs, while the ENTJ would get bored pretty quickly.\n \n\n**ISFJ**: 6 year on/off relationship with one, another very close friend, brother’s girlfriend, couple female friends\n\n- Pros: Warm, loving people.  Appreciate the little things in life.  Really loved how much my ex-cared about her family despite them being fairly dysfunctional and not giving anything back in return.  My close guy friend has my back no matter what and often gives way more than he should.  Great listeners and will help you out any way they can. Amazing memory, and, unlike ISTJs, often focused on nostalgic, happy times. Very forgiving people if you are genuinely sorry about something.\n\n- Cons: I feel that they are perpetually stressed individuals, even healthy ones.  They can be stubborn, moody, and hold grudges if you don’t directly address them and apologize if necessary. Can be boring.\n\nRelationship potential: Yes, think it’s a good pairing.\n\n\n**INTJ**: Senior coworker, close friend\n\n- Pros: Interesting people.  Logical, dependable, self-sufficient.  Their dry sense of humor and hilarious metaphors always make me laugh.  Offer an interesting perspective on some things. Dependable, and I’d imagine even more so in a relationship. \n\n- Cons: Hold themselves to a higher standard than perhaps any type.  Doesn’t seem to take constructive criticism well. Oftentimes find some of their views and passions in life “cute and funny” rather than interesting and thought-provoking.  \n\nRelationship potential: Maybe. I think the ESTP could get bored, and the INTJ would feel fairly marginalized. \n\n\n**ENTP**: old co-worker, current pseudo-supervisor, girl I went on a few dates with etc. etc.  This will be an interesting one, as I’ve sat, literally, over 5,000 hours next to an ENTP over my last 2 jobs.\n\n- Pros: Funny, shrewd, extremely skilled in finding possibilities in everything – especially useful in business.  Good conversationalists and offer interesting insight.\n\n- Cons: Suffer from the same “outwardly confident, inwardly subconscious” problem facing ESTPs.  Talk…a lot – often about some stuff you really don’t care about that they find super interesting.  Contradict themselves every other sentence. Talk around stuff instead of addressing it.  Can be extremely sleazy, emotionally immature, and in my opinion the least trustworthy of all types.  Talks a lot of shit and plays devil’s advocate for literally no other reason because it’s stimulating to them, notwithstanding the fact they know they're completely wrong.  Had a fun time with the girl though.\n\nRelationship potential: This would be disastrous.\n\n\n**INTP**: Brother in law, cousin, lots of people I’ve come across on the internet.\n\n- Pros: Insightful, head always full of ideas, courteous.  Like ESTPs, love using that Ti for talking about theories at a high level without needing to discuss the exact details.  Unlike many other types, they don’t feel the need to be needed.  Open to challenge and exploring the meaning behind something. Really enjoy talking with INTPs and always find my relationship with them satisfying.\n\n- Cons: Scatterbrained, disorganized, gets obsessed with a random idea, only to find the amount of attention to detail is a bit more than they expected.  Probably does not give nearly as much in relationships as their significant other.\n\nRelationship potential: Why not?\n\n\n**INFP**: A friend and a few others I’ve come across over the years\n\n- Pros: Warm, caring people. Love how tune they are with their emotions inwardly, yet appreciate purely logical discussions.\n\n- Cons: Idealistic to a fault. Can become cold and defensive when challenged.  Need to be appreciated. Really can’t find anything else bad to say about them.\n\n- Relationship potential: Good match IMO – have found that each type really appreciates and truly understands the other. Would be interested in meeting some more INFPs\n\n\n**INFJ**: Ex-girlfriend (only ~6 month relationship), female cousin\n\n- Pros: There’s just something about INFJs.  I’m not sure exactly what it is, but you all know exactly what I’m talking about. I dated the INFJ girl during a tough part in my life, and she had the tendency to see exactly what I needed before I could figure it out myself.  Super caring, creative beyond belief, a sweet, innocent soul.  Found the type is surprisingly intellectual for an NF who allegedly sits at home reading books about unicorns all day. Almost everything about INFJs make me smile.\n\n- Cons: Also idealistic to a fault.  Stuck in their own head, bottles up feelings before unleashing them upon you 10x worse than you’d imagine. Very, very, stubborn with certain views – especially ones about themselves.  The INFJ door slam is real and non-negotiable.  Except when they turn to their shadow functions and drunk text you, but I digress.\n\n- Relationship potential: I really like the ESTP-INFJ dynamic – the ESTP helps get the INFJ out of their head and back into the real world, while the INFJ can help an ESTP grow emotionally.\n\n\n**ENFP**: Current girlfriend, good guy friend, girl I had a short fling with I kept in contact with for awhile:\n\n- Pros: I find ENFPs fascinating. On one hand, you see a gregarious, larger than life person cracking jokes and bringing everyone out of their shells, and on the other side – pure mystery (best I could do, INFJ readers).  The more you get to know them, the more you discover not only the lust for life & sense of adventure but this sort of warmth that, unlike with other types, isn’t communicated verbally and does not need to be.  The way they speak to you, look at you, and physically show their love makes you feel like the most loved person in the world. Biased because I’m dating an ENFP? Nahhh\n\n- Cons: They constantly need to be brought down to Earth, as the might actually be living in the future. Half joking, but their focus on the future makes them miss actually what’s happening right now. Can be bitter towards people -\nespecially if someone is wronging either them or someone else they care about.  Tendency to get offended easily, also knows how to hit you where it hurts. Can be a little bit shady to do everything in their power to not be “judged” by some action they do, which can affect trust in relationships. Can be immature on a lot of things.\n\n- Relationship potential: Would love to say “hell yeah!” but I can absolutely acknowledge many of the potential communication barriers with the ESTP-ENFP pairing - many which I've experienced.
7	INFJ one is too real, currently going on two and a half years with mine. Good post overall 
4	Istp here. Just stopping by to read the good things about me and jerk one off real quick. Ahh that was nice. Ok thanks bye. \n\nAlso the length and depth of these impressions make me highly doubt you are estp.
2	Wow
1	Awww give estps more credit in relationships-- I'm an infj and I love my estp.
1	ESTJs are awesome, all the fun and they'll take full responsibility of organizing it and cleaning up afterwards
1	I recall when I made my 3rd reddit post 
0	How to keep a relationship interesting with an ESTP girl?	I have noticed this ESTP who leaves relationships when she gets bored of it, so how to keep it interesting?
4	As an ESTP and a girl 👏 \nKeep talking to her and express how youre interested in the things shes interested with in a none assertive way- genuinely enjoying the things she likes. Just enjoy the moment with her, she'll open up to you.
3	Don't be boring, and figure it out from her instead of asking the internet
2	She sounds like an immature ESTP in my opinion who relies too much on Se. But anyways, if you're into that, definitely stimulate her Se. For example, if you take her on a date, make sure it's something more active and stimulates the senses like hiking, a concert, a picnic with a nice view, etc. Something more than just sitting down to eat at a boujee restaurant and small-talk for a few hours. That can get boring really quick as an ESTP female myself lol\n\nBut overall, just be yourself, and if she doesn't like that at the end of the day then its not worth your time. Good luck :)
1	Give her the inability to sit down...if you get my drift....\n\nremove all the chairs and surfaces in your house. 😐\n\n*ESTP whispers into ENTPs ear*\n\nWait? What? What did you think I meant by “give her the inability to sit down”?\n\n*ESTP whispers into ENTPs ear again* \n\nOh, your one wee dirty bastard!\n\n*ENTP gives a BIG unsettling smile with big Rape, sociopathic eyes* \n\n*ESTP smirks*\n\nA Clockwork Orange 2 occurs...\n\n(ESTP gets arrested whilst the ENTP puts the entire blame on the ESTP and after attending court and being considered“Not guilty” the ENTP writes about the entire situation)
1	ESxP: Ghost Stories / Are thoses observations true or not ?	
2	Noises in the attic and shit turning on by itself and then a huge portion of thumbnails that are chicks with clickbait titles and whatever in them makes me dismiss this in its entirety 
2	You can sense with their reactions and the way they convey ther stories tbh. Most are just fake but some of them are real. Based on what I see on that thumbnail tho, seems fake
1	It's a common trend that I've noticed in other estps including myself I think it could be due to our inferior NI and Si underdevelopment that is taking over our Se during times of High stress . 
10	What are your insecurities ESTPs?	ESTP, outwardly, look like the person that fear nothing and all cool. But for sure there are deep insecurities deep inside of you just like everyone.\n\nAs an INFJ, I think my top insecurity and which I thought of right away is my thoughts and them being not accepted or put down. I think this has to with Ni-Ti.\n\nFor ESTP, my guess fpr your insecurity would be how people perceive you and how fun and nice they others think of you, because of your Se-Fe. \n
27	Being hurt or betrayed, especially by people close to you. It's the #1 on my list of insecurities, so much that I don't even notice that I'm constantly evaluating people for their trustworthiness. I have plan b's for everyone in case they turn on me, regardless of how well the relationship is going. I always want to be ready to fight back in case someone turns on me, and sometimes it gets overwhelming. 
11	probably that below the friendly, outgoing, light and charming surface, I feel a whole lot of nagging emptiness in myself that I'm afraid to be face to face with. I don't want to go to my inner world much myself, much less let anyone else get in there- makes it difficult to have deeper relationships though
4	What kinda of people do you ESTPs onsider to be real close friends?	You guys are able to have almost anyone as a friend, but do you actually view everyone as a friend or just someone who is in your circle?\n\nWhat kind of friends are the ones you are willing to do anything to keep?\n\nAnother question, what do you expect from a friend? \nIs being fun the characteristic you want the most for a friend to have?
22	Enough similarities to keep the ball rolling. Enough differences to keep it interesting. Trust and loyalty on their part will result in the same from me. People who reach that level are better described as family and are to die for\n\n\nESTP friendships are tools. You're of some use to me. I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine. When you stop scratching it, I will break it off. So long as there's a mutual exchange of something that the other needs, we're in business 
3	Big 5 Correlations (x-post from r/INFJ)	Edit*\n\n##[Results Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/89k2lv/big_5_correlations_results/)\n\n-------\n\nHey there, ESTPs! I'm a mod over on r/INFJ and we've been doing this experiment to see if we can confirm any Big 5 correlations between MBTI types. So far I've got input from INFJs, INTJs, INTPs, and ENTPs, mostly. I've asked a few other types as well and now I'm coming to you :) I promise to come back with results if I get enough people to participate. Just state your type (it's ok if you're not an ESTP) and your % scores for each Big 5 category, and feel free to add anything else from your results if you want to share. Thanks in advance!\n\n-------\n\nThere is a lot of talk regarding MBTI vs [the Big 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) - [is MBTI as valid](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/08/02/what-is-the-current-thinking-about-myers-briggs), do they correlate ([1](https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/13460/what-correlation-research-has-been-done-on-mbti-vs-big5), [2](https://personalityjunkie.com/09/openness-myers-briggs-mbti-intuition-big-five-iq-correlations/)), etc. I thought a community post would be a good way to see what kind of distribution we have when we compile results. With enough participants, I'll report back the distributions and see what shakes out :)\n\n##[You can take the Big 5 test here](https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test)\n\n(it's free, the $29 "cost" refers to the cost of their premium report, and you also don't need to create an account to see your results, just click "no thanks")\n\n**Please comment here with your type (let me know your type so we're not mixing results) and the percentages for each Big 5 category.**\n\nBelow is an overview of the Big 5 for those who are unfamiliar.\n\n-----\n\n[*From wikipedia:*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits)\n\n> * **Openness** to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)  \nAppreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity and a preference for novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine. High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus, and more likely to engage in risky behaviour or drug taking. Also, individuals that have high openness tend to lean towards being artists or writers in regards to being creative and appreciate the significance of the intellectual and artistic pursuits. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven—sometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor.\n\n>* **Conscientiousness** (efficient/organized vs. easy-going/careless)  \nA tendency to be organized and dependable, show self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior. High conscientiousness is often perceived as stubbornness and obsession. Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability.\n\n>* **Extraversion** (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)  \nEnergy, positive emotions, surgency, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extraversion is often perceived as attention-seeking, and domineering. Low extraversion causes a reserved, reflective personality, which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed. Extroverted people tend to be more dominant in social settings, opposed to introverted people who may act more shy and reserved in this setting.\n\n>* **Agreeableness** (friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/detached)  \nA tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and whether a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentativeness or untrustworthiness.\n\n>* **Neuroticism** (sensitive/nervous vs. secure/confident)  \nNeuroticism identifies certain people who are more prone to psychological stress. The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, "emotional stability". A high stability manifests itself as a stable and calm personality, but can be seen as uninspiring and unconcerned. A low stability expresses as a reactive and excitable personality, often very dynamic individuals, but they can be perceived as unstable or insecure. It has also been researched that individuals with higher levels of tested neuroticism, tend to have worse psychological well being.\n\n[*From a peer-reviewed paper:*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886996000335):\n\n>The NEO-PI Agreeableness score was correlated only with the thinking-feeling (T-F) dimension; the NEO-PI Conscientiousness score was correlated with both thinking-feeling and judging-perceiving (J-P) dimension; the NEO-PI Extraversion score was strongly correlated with the extraversion-introversion (E-I) dimensions, while the Neuroticism score from the NEO-PI was not related to any MBTI subscale score. The openness dimension was correlated with all four especially sensing-intuitive.

1	Yeah I get like super high openness and like 100% extraversion, like zero neuroticism and usually really low agreeableness, don't remember conscientiousness but based on that description I'd say low
2	What jobs do ESTP women usually have?	
16	Same jobs as men, it's 2018 you sexist /s
4	[deleted]
3	I'm a pastry chef. So I guess that
2	I'm a public health dietitian. My main persuasion to this profession is: I'm good with science, I care about less fortunate/at risk people, and eating/cooking are fun. I like the job stability and decent pay too.
2	I don't have one yet but currently taking Pharmacy in college. Will be proceeding to a masters degree in family medicine.
2	I'm currently still in college and I'll probably get my Bachelor's in Business Admin with a concentration in HR. \nBy the time I graduate, I'll have been in 3 different universities and 3 different majors. I went from math to Spanish to business. My academic career is a long story, but I realized I'm very well suited for business.\nCurrently, I work as an intern at a real estate office, but my boss has 3 other companies that I do random work for too. I also have a screen printing subcontracting job on the side.
1	The ones I know: business development, waitress, pharmacist
1	My mom is an ESTP entrepreneur. We're wedding DJs and MC and sound equipment rental. In my childhood my mom has MC'd soooo many parties hahaha. Her charisma and organizational skills really shone, it's great fun to watch her. \n\nShe's also a housecleaner, very thorough and clean. 
1	I'm a female ESTP entrepreneur and I also do marketing consultant work on the side for extra money. Work on a bunch of different projects in a wide range of areas with a bunch of diff teams. Love the chaos, flexibility, freedom
10	Core Values	Hey estp here, what do you think are the core values of our personality? I feel like focusing on those core aspects helps you be a more healthy type.
8	Freedom, self determination, self reliance. 
7	Independence, pleasure/fun, challenges/risks, exploration/growth.
5	In addition to the other, principle and belief 
3	Contentedness, freedom from regret, independence 
3	Competence, agency, competition
2	Enneagram and IV?	Been scrolling through posts and don't really see anything related to it much(?)\n\nI'm 9w1 3w2 7w6 soc/sx\nJust curious, whats yalls?

3	ESTP guy who made a bunch of videos on MBTI a few years ago and then deleted them all; but some videos were reposted by other people	Who was this guy?
6	Yeah Arendee kind of lost his mind. Wasn't he homeless on and off?
3	Dude went cray cray 
1	Do you have anything else? Topics of the videos, part of his/the video's names, did he appear or we're they just voice-overs?  \n  \nNvm, you just meant Dj/Ej Arendee, didn't you?
3	Any ESTPs ever date an ISFJ?	If so, what was your experience like?
3	Married one. Been together 7 years and have a 1 year old. She fills my bad spots
3	[deleted]
2	It's one of the better type matches for ESTP, basically anything with Fe or Ni is a decent match. Avoid Fi lol. Called "mirage relationship" in socionics: [**ESTP type matches**](http://personalitycafe.com/estp-articles/289-love-types-estp-5.html#post10023554).
2	ESTPs, what tends to happen to you under stress/ tierd and exhausted with what is going in life?	As an INFJ (probably more of INFJs too) we would live on our inferior for a while, which is Se, and so becoming more like an ESTP by wanting to have fun and not stay in our heads because its messy when stressed.\n\nI was wondering, do you ESTPs become more like INFJs when under stress? Do you withdraw from the outside world and action and become more of an introvert? What does happen and what do you do?
10	It's frustrating. Fuse shortens, kind of a bad mood, it's like a light depression. You just are endlessly waiting for a moment to step away from everything and decompress, do a hard reset. After that, everything is good again 
8	sleep alot, do alot of nothing (on my phone, social media time wasting, video games). procrastination generally just becomes a thing for me (might just be because i'm in school though)
3	There is an old thread that talks about functions and how ESTPs react toy stuff. I'll try to dig it up because it felt accurate for me under stress.
3	When I’m under a lot of stress, I try to find a solution to the problems that are stressing me out. I think a lot of ESTPs like myself view most things in terms of problems that can be fixed and solutions (AKA results) that will fix them quickly. Needless to say there aren’t a ton of things that will stress me out. \n\nHowever, when I have a problem that there’s no immediate or feasible solution to, I’ll get frustrated and irritable and a little short with people too. I’ll kind of withdraw back and become more quiet than I usually am and go into “observation mode” as opposed to my typical “action” mode. 
2	All I do is bite my fingernails 😩 that’s really the only way you can till I’m stressed. 
2	I do get tired and tend to become more introverted. I start to withdraw from everything and push people away. But, I also go further into my Se; in usually unhealthy ways. I use external stimulation as a way to mask my problems or to avoid facing inner turmoil. For example, I'll go to a lot of concerts, shows, busy my time with people that don't really add to my life, reckless behavior, etc. I try to have as much reckless fun as I can as a distraction. But now I'm more aware of this and have developed my nearly non-existent Fi a bit more, I'm more self-aware to not revert to this unhealthy pattern of overstimulating Se anymore. 
5	Heya, ENFJ here !	Hey guyss so my best friend is an ESTP (weird pair I know) and I wanted to send you guys a little love ! I haven’t known him for a very long time, but he has helped me in sooooo many ways, I can’t express how thankful I am. He’s helped me become a better person through a lot of tough love and brutal honesty and I’m so thankful for it. I love getting stuck in Fe-Se/Se-Fe loops with him :p \nWhen he had to move away he gave me his favorite shot glass, one with tits on it. I just feel like it’s such an ESTP way to show appreciation aha\n\nAnyways just wanted to say that you guys are awesome and share a bit of my experience with one of you ! 
3	>I just feel like it’s such an ESTP way to show appreciation   \n\nIt definitely is, haha
2	I had a boobs shot glass I gave away to someone as a parting gift lol
9	What is on your mind?	What are ESTP usually thinking? Is it goals? 
12	My normal thoughts:\n\nWhat am I doing right now?\nWhen will I finish?\nWhat should I do next?\nHow? Why? Is this important?\nDo I even want to do this?\n\nExample:\n\nWhile watching a doc on primates;\n\nMonkeys are cool maybe I should become a primatologist with my Gi Bill. Yeah gotta finish my military contract first. I really should clean my room, and pack my car. Should I go get food right now? It's 11pm, I could get food, pack my car, and go to sleep and hit the road in the morning. Or I could leave now and get food on the way. Do I really want to drive 14 hours RIGHT NOW? Well I probably won't sleep much anyway and the sooner I leave the sooner I get there. What the fuck am I doing? I'm just wasting time deciding what to do. I should check social media while I decide. R/airforce has no new posts since the last time I checked. R/MBTI nothing new either. Long shot but let's check r/estp. Oh look a new post. This could be interesting, *starts typing this comment* damn this just triggered me and reminded me I still haven't made a decision what to do. I'll probably hit send and then go pack my car and get food then decide if I want to drive or sleep first. 
11	Nothing. I don't think about anything most of the time unless I'm engaged in something or something is bothering me. Calm seas up top amigo
11	When I’m engaged in something or with someone, usually nothing much. But when I’m alone I find myself thinking back on past events, planning my schedules, thinking of solutions to problems I am facing and so on. I like to think I am living in my own bubble when I’m not around people. 
3	Currently reading Ernest Hemingway quotes as he’s an ESTP. & I’m thinking about how true his quote is “When people talk, listen completely. Most people never listen.” When I’m speaking with someone they have my full attention & I notice when I speak to others and sometimes even when responding to that person they can get distracted at times. It’s so true & honestly quite unfortunate because people don’t know what they’re missing out on. People & stories can be so interesting & they miss out on me because once I notice they’re not paying attention they lose me as a conversational partner. 
2	I can’t speak for other ESTPs. But I’m usually thinking of new ways to make more money and/or something fun to do in the present moment. \n\nI don’t think very far into the future and usually preoccupied with things that are going on here and now. 
1	I'm always thinking on how I should be utilizing my time well and use my time to socialize with others, although I'm a lazy college student so I also enjoy sleeping and procrastinating and then thinking about how I wasted my time and how I could have been at the bar drinking with friends. Time is always on my mind.
1	Bluntly speaking\nMy mind 24/7 is completely blank\nNo "voices", no "inner thoughts"\nI do what I do subconsciously\n\nWhat happens right now, happens right now and I dont even think of it and i just do it\n\nEhhh.. Does that make sense?\n
7	I made a CSS theme for this sub	It is very gray. Basically the standard theme but less blinding and with more material design. Have I told you guys how much I **love** material design? Well now I did.\n\nMy perfectionism isn't quite satisfied, but I figured I might as well use it now [before they change everything](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/817lmi/til_reddit_has_a_design_team/)
5	Can you hit us mobile users with a screen shot 
2	I love this new theme good job
2	Slick!

1	No.
1	Yea
1	Ayee
1	Naw I never just lay in bed worrying about shit when I can fix it. If I can’t fix it then there’s no point worrying. \n\nFirst image is accurate though. 
10	Which subtype of ESTP are you? Sensory or Logical?	ESTP subtypes:\n\n**ESTP-Se** - Seems clever, impulsive, seemingly concealing within him a latent threat. Far from being easygoing and appeasable. In reality, he can be sharp, sufficiently aggressive, and persistent. Can hold a grudge and be sufficiently resourceful to make the life of his ill-wishers become intolerable. Has a contrasting and unpredictable character. With those whom he loves can be kind, tender, even sentimental. Possesses a sense of humor, that easily molds into sarcasm and caustic irony. Talkative, charming, witty, critical and sharp. - [**Full description**](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/6796-Two-subtypes-of-SLEs-ESTps-which-one-are-you)\n\n**ESTP-Ti** - Leaves an impression of calm strength and self-assurance. Rational and consistent in his affairs. Hardworking and enduring. Usually he is cold-blooded, restrained, collected and unfazed, but in moments of irritation does not conceal his anger, which shows in his look and in sudden categorical gestures. When he is calm, he is polite and courteous, tough keeps his conversation partners at a distance. His humor is blunt and can be somewhat crude. Sometimes he has a fast moving, distrustful look that looks from under his eyebrows. - [**Full description**](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/showthread.php/6796-Two-subtypes-of-SLEs-ESTps-which-one-are-you)

5	I am the definition of a logical ESTP
3	Mostly Ti now, I used to lean more sensory until I mellowed out with age
3	I've seen some people who like to include the Fe and Ni subtypes. I'm definitely an Ni subtype. Otherwise, idk. Probably Se subtype.\n\n I'm a pretty nice dude and I don't hold grudges. I've realized I can get angry pretty quickly. Apparently I'm pretty naturally aggressive and confrontational but theres never any actual ill will or poor temperament. It just happens.
3	Definitely more Ti
2	Leaning more towards Ti. 
2	Ti
1	More Ti, but I exhibit traits of the other as well. But I match the Ti one more \n\n\n\nI'm also a 7w8 as opposed to the usual 3w4 I think it is, I wonder if it correlates 
1	If you're a Ti sub-type, wouldn't that make you an ISTP or INTP? Perhaps I am mixing it up with dominant functions.
1	Both. ESTP-Se when things are going well. ESTP-Ti when I’m focused on a goal and have something I’m working towards. Thought & discipline are needed so I go Ti mode to help me focus and stay committed. It makes me come off as that description I suppose. But I much prefer to be Se, however I have a strong Ti and that grip sometimes does make me intellectual & seemingly a bit reserved and observant. It depends on my mood & current focus either intellectually or in general.
10	What do you all think of this description?	
7	>if we look for a fullest and simultaneously shortest description of the ESTP type, it would be the word 'most'.  \n  \nShall I put that as the sidebar description? 😏 "ESTP are the most." 
5	Accurate af 
2	It's not bad \n\n\nI hate Realist as a black and white theme of the type. I think we're all extremely *realistic*, but that doesn't make us Realists. Just extremely grounded
2	Too much of enneagram type 7 influence - it's 7s that turn to hedonism at lower health levels, but other enneagram types like ESTP 8s or 6s will behave differently.
2	Se-Fe loop	Lately, I feel as if I am in an Se-Fe loop. It seems to have been going on for a couple of weeks now and I can’t get out of it. \n\nI wanna ask:\n-How do you guys usually get it?\n-How do you get out of it? 
2	What does that mean
1	Reading, meditating, maybe even playing video games should "restore" your Ti.
1	go outdoors and do some sport or something with a big bunch of friends.\nBe very honest with yourself.\nDo something logic-using.
1	Find an infj :D
1	It probably means that your subtype is sensory [Se-ESTP](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=SLE_subtypes#Sensory_subtype_Se-ESTp_.28Se-SLE.29). Se-ESTPs sometimes get stuck in Se-Fe loops. To chill out find some introverts to hang out with especially Ti & Ni introverts like IxFJs and IxTPs and INTJs. They'll help to bring out your introverted Ti, while INxJs will lure out the Ni.
5	Why isn't this sub as active as some of the other MBTI subs?	Is it because we are extroverts that would rather spend time away from the computer or what?
12	Lack of interest or use 
10	Why not hang out with people or play video games or do literally anything else than post on this sub. Only time I browse reddit is when I’m doing something like waiting on an oil change or sitting in a waiting room...
5	I'm assuming Etypes just like to be busy. Not idle browsing stuff, but actively doing things. My boyfriend is ESTP and when he's using the computer he's working on a project, answering emails, contacting friends on Facebook messenger or posting for his movie on IG and reddit.
6	I'm out doing things or talking in person with someone. I find that many subs tend to be refective, which ESTP's either don't feel the point/need to reflect or have nothing to add since we are direct.\n\nWhen I'm online, its more of a means to an end(of finding information or sharing info) rather that sharing or exploring my opinions.\n\nEven when I search for an answer, once we have 1 answer and comfirm it, I accept it and move on to the next topic.\n\n*Moves on to next topic*
4	I got way more important stuff to do than start bs topics on some obscure subreddit. 
1	Because most ESTP's think MBTI is horse shit
1	There are fewer Extroverted Sensors found on the internet than some other types. The stats on Personality Cafe typology forum showed that INFP was the most common type, was like at 18% so almost 1 in 5 people you bump into there is an INFP, and that was closely followed by other INxx types like INTPs and INFJs. You'll hardly find any ESFJs, ESFPs, ESTPs, and ESTJs on these boards.
1	Some interesting thoughts in here, here to add mine. A lot of the most active MTBI subs focus on emotions and how they feel about things. As a generality, we ESTPs aren't always good at recognizing how we feel about shit, less have an inclination to talk about it. I personally know how I would typically react to something through actions, but don't know what I would feel. Shit, sometimes I don't find out how I felt about something until weeks after the fact 
2	How many novels did you read in 2017?	
2	Do textbooks count 
1	0
6	Taming the ESTP child	I'm an F parent with a preteen girl who fits the description of an ESTP child. (IDK if she is, but she's definitely an E - TP. ) Any advice on effective parenting ? Looking back..what discipline worked for you and what didn't ? 
5	Honesty. My dad is ESFP and my mom is INTJ. Both of them puts honesty above all.\n\nExample: I borrow my dads new bike when they are on holiday. I do not have the license to drive it. When I park it I call my dad and tells him the bike runs smoothly We talk about it for a bit before he goes "OK, thanks for telling me, I would like you not to drive it again illegaly!" And I go "OK, have fun on the holiday" and I do not touch it.\n\nSo open dialog, if a rule is broken it is broken, no point nagging about it. But talk about how the experience was and ask to not do it again/think about safety. \n\nIn Regards to school work I was always told to not close doors. Say I know I need a D to get into whatever. No point working harder! I was told that "it is OK to get a D, but maybe later I would like to do something different. And maybe I needed a C or a B to get in. It would suck to look back and know that I actually fucked it up for my self?!"\n\nStupid rules with no point does not work. If you explain the rule and maybe make a compromisse. But never go "you can't do this" end. \n\nMy mom told me that the toilet cant flush deodorant when I was 5. So I tested. Had she Said something like "maybe it works, maybe it wont work. But the deodorant cost money, and if it doesent work We do not have a toilet, so I would prefere to not test it" I might not have done it. Because I remember doing it to prove it could be done (×2).
4	There needs to be a logical sanction when she makes a mistake. Moral argument will have little effect on her. Emotional punishment will only confuse her.\n\nFor example,\n\nIf she steals a friend's toy, you can't scold her saying "You did wrong. That is bad. You are a bad girl. You disappoint me." or something like that. She'll just think you are bullying her.\n\nYou should say, "You did wrong. It is bad *because* when your friend finds out, she will not trust you. She may even stop being your friend. She may tell on you to other people. Then other people will not trust you. It is bad *because* it will be a habit if you don't stop it now, and there will be severe punishment when you grow up. It is a bad behavior *because* it will harm your life. You need to stop doing this."\n\nYou should talk to her logic. That's the key to her heart.
2	My parents had to use a lot of corporal punishment on me, the beatings helped in hindsight and I didn't respond to anything else. Afterwards they pushed me to live and die by my strengths, so push your daughter to do the same. There are some things you won't be able to control. I always understood that my parents loved me and supported me so I was gonna do what I wanted to do as far as school and careers and whatever else that fit my interests and goals, and whether or not I took their advice was up to me and they'd follow me through it regardless 
2	Help her see consequences in advance. \n\nNothing worse than doing something I didn't know was against the rules (because we didn't have a rule) and then get in trouble. \n\nHonestly "punishments" never worked. I was easily entertained even in my room without my phone. \n\nTaking away privileges like "no you can't go on that trip because you didn't clean your room" would just make me resentful. \n\nBe willing to debate the reasons why rules are in place. I HATED "because I'm your dad and I said so"\n\nBe ready to let some control go, we're capable and like to show it. We forge our own way and honestly just like to know there's a safety net if we fail. \n\nThe good things my mom said to me growing up;\n-you can be anything you want just be ready to work for it \n-idc if you're forty if you need a bed and a meal I will help you\n-if you're ever in trouble with the law please don't be afraid to call me. I won't be mad, your safety is just the most important thing 
4	Memes	Anyone got any good ESTP memes? 
3	>mbti memes 
22	Any ESTPs reach their twenties and suddenly realize they are the main character of their life?	Maybe it's a coming out of a Se/Fe loop and engaging Ti but maybe it's just me? 😅
12	This. In my early twenties and suddenly feel as if I’m really living my life. Used to feel suppressed by family environment and depression, but now I have the liberty to do whatever I want and build my career. Also became more willing than ever to experience and learn new things in life. Social skills improved leaps and bounds too.
9	About 18 or 19 I was like "I really am the only one gunning for me, nobody else cares about my life or will do shit for me other than myself." \n\n\nSo yeah I got you there. That's why I feel like I (we?) are inherently selfish, because nobody else is gonna do it for us so we take our lives upon ourselves. That's where the leadership and social skills come in as well, everyone and everything is a potential tool
6	Yeah. It’s about that same time I realised rules are there to keep stupid people in line. 
2	Annnnd I’ve accepted I’m an ESTP,  however I do prefer to be alone mostly because people are emotional labor I can’t afford at the moment because I’m busy, however I do like to be around people briefly to recharge and then retreat into my solitude.
1	Honestly since as long as I can remember lol 
1	That happens with most types that have strong Ti and that tend to omit Fe/Fi.
8	Do ESTPs read novels?	Sometimes?\n\nIf you did, what books did you like?
5	Fantasy 
4	My last read was The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson. Currently on A Coin in Nine Hands by Marguerite Yourcenar. 
3	As a teen I liked A Series of Unfortunate Events. Sad endings have more depth. Enders Game was cool, as I could picture it in my head. Holes, Kite Runner, Metamorphosis and Maus round out my top 'forced school reads'. In college I liked ethnographies- mainly how cultures are structured and differences  between societies. \n\nI read non fiction about 80% of the time. I like books on finance, public health/science journals, or about psych/societies.\n\n The last 5 books I bought/read: \n-The Latinos of Asia: How Filipino Americans Break the Rules of Race \n-German/English Visiual dictionary (to keep my limited german from floating away. Use it or lose it)\n- The Big Letdown (How western soceity ruins breastfeeding)\n- 5 love languages (quality time/touch)\n-Obama: The call to history (Dope timeline, tons of pics. Goes well with my other political book from Colbert)\n\nNoteable favorite: All my friends are dead
2	If it fits my interests and is well written than yeah I love reading, my imagination is vivid enough for it to be enjoyable 
1	Books are boring. - INFJ
1	I do yet I'm quite picky\nMystery, Horror, SciFi, Paranormal, Gore, Thriller are some genres I really love\nI dont have a thing for romance, not that I despise it but I show 0 interest\n\nI've read books such as the Harry Potter, Series of Unfortunate Events, and Miss Peregrine. As a kid I'd read Nancy Drew or Hardy Boys\n\nBut if I had to pick between novels or movies- I prefer movies more
13	How ESTPs win over girls	
5	Literally did this just earlier today.

2	Wtf 😂 😂 😆 - INFJ
5	ESTP-INFJ Communication	Instantly thought of the typical INFJ-ESTP conversation. XD\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BQcFjA2sDA\n\nSe VS. Ni XD Little do they know.
3	My mom is an ESTP and I’m an INFJ, yet I have a lot of shared qualities with her.
2	Well my SO is an INFJ so let's see here\n\n\n\nToo much confidence and too assured in literally anything to be INFJ
4	How would you describe your personality yourself?	Independently of MBTI.  \n~~totally not shopping around for a new sidebar description~~
8	DeeZ nuts 
7	Nah but seriously though. I’d describe myself as Charismatic, funny, optimistic, and laid back. I tend to think of myself as very lenient. I think I’m not so good in the strength of will department. I can adapt to many things and think I’m pretty kind to people and forgiving generally speaking. I love to talk to people and even in spite of all I’ve gone through I’m still not giving up 
3	Larger than life. 
3	I'd say I live my life how I feel like living it, I draw my own lines, and I'd love to catch y'all on the flip side 
2	[deleted]
5	Not knowing what to think of stuff	Does anyone else here have a problem with knowing what to think of stuff?\n\nIn political things, for example, I tend to take statements by politicians and other debaters at face value, and I don't really consider any implications beyond the surface. A lot of the times when I try to do think of implications, I end up finding out I was way off and no one else thought of it. I tend to rely on allies' interpretations of events in politics,--and they often tie the actions/statements to other political issues and other political statements/actions--and I'm usually pretty good at doing this and arguing my allies' points. But sometimes it just leaves me feeling kinda dumb, like I can't think of anything on my own.\n\nAnyone else have these experiences?
7	You’re not alone.\nI am kinda the same way as well, feeling like I can’t form arguments of my own. Usually what I do is that I try to look into both sides’ opinions, evaluate then come up with my own conclusion. Not specifically in politics though. 
3	Are you ESTPs attracted to introverts?	ESTP are of the most energetic and dynamic types. \nExtroverts' energy attracts introverts in general. \nBut is it the same way around? 
6	I like introverts, most of my close friends are. I have the most fun hanging around extroverts but together we can be really loud at times. Introverts make a good balance.
2	Yeah pretty much. Zany, super random girls make me want to blow my brains out. 
1	Well I don't like being around people who are MORE extroverted than me because that's overwhelming, so yes, I do enjoy introverts as well. I want to date a chill girl that balances out my club lifestyle 
1	Yes! I tend to enjoy spending time with introverted judging types in fact. Most of my closest friends and my husband are IxSJs. 
1	Depends...but if they are too closed I get bored. I like people who are energetic and fun.\n
7	An intellectual ESTP	Working with my therapist, and making use of the following source:\n\nhttp://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/basics\n\nhttp://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/theory\n\nI had always identified myself as an INTP (because I'm smart and I like learning, duh :/ ), but when I worked with my therapist on what type I was, that was not so clear. Looking at the basics page, it was actually somewhat unclear whether I was an extravert or introvert, but I was clearly a thinker and a perceiver. The most interesting part was of whether I was a sensor or an intuitive. I could identify much more with the sensor stuff than with the intuitive stuff. So it looked like I was a xSTP, which surprised me. Then we went to the theory page, and looked at whether inferior Fe or inferior Ni better explained my life. And much to my surprise, inferior Fe didn't really fit me, and my therapist agreed, saying that these were not really issues he's seen in me. But inferior Ni fit me much better, and my therapist agreed. So I'm ESTP, even though I don't fit the stereotype at all. (Later on, when I told my ENTJ dad, he told me that for sure he always thought I was 100% extraverted. It makes sense: until I started getting all gloomy in my late 20s, I was very outgoing and loved doing stuff like playing team sports for fun, putting out fires at work which helped break the monotony, etc.)\n\nWe discussed how being intuitive was a weakness for me. For example, recently I was looking at career development with a peer partner, and I asked him for help with pursuing a career option as the process was very complicated, and we worked out a specific plan. And I was happy with that, when he started talking about all sorts of other careers I could try doing. All that was good and all, but I was getting annoyed because I already had something I wanted to try. Other issues with intuition are the fact that I am never clear on where I'll be in 5 years, and often don't know how to respond to questions like "How are you feeling?" My therapist told me that when I would not answer these questions, he wondered if I was being defensive, but looking at the context of my type it now makes more sense of something that just doesn't have much meaning for me: I tend to take things as they come, and day by day, and I generally don't know how to talk about how I'm feeling unless there is a specific problem. Other things, like sitting down and brainstorming or naming off 5 of something from memory, are other areas of difficulty for me.\n\nKnowing I'm ESTP provides a framework for action for me: Go out and do stuff and gain experience, instead of just staying at home gloomy all day.
13	ESTPs can be, and commonly are, very intellectual. Same goes for ISTPs.
10	My ESTP bro is a fellow medical doctor. Recently he posted a picture of himself on top a mountain.\n\nIntellect is largely hardwork, as with many other masteries. 
9	Maybe people equate activity with stupidity but it's quite the opposite. Estps are very smart, maybe it comes as a surprise because they have so much more than intelligence going on. Amidst all the fun and parties it's unexpected they were writing a book during that time as well. 
8	Welcome to the club, now you get to enjoy how biased the mbti community is against sensors and extroverts who apparently aren't normally intellectual 
3	Welcome to the club! We're pretty fun (as you know) but dont chat it up too much on this sub.\n\nI'm happy to hear that you were able to get through all the noise that considers estp's to be 100% reckless.
4	Intellectual ESTPs are fascinating to me (ENTJ). They can make me nervous. In a good way. Mostly.
3	ESTP maybe, still don't see the intellectual side.
2	Nice.
2	That's great you found that out. Going out and doing stuff to gain experience is great advice for any perceiving type. \n\nI actually wonder from time to time if I'm an ESTP... I've pitched the idea to friends before, usually using examples from my past such as showing off all the time in sports as a kid and craving others to recognise my talent, dreaming of being a professional athlete... Once I realised that me becoming a professional athlete was never going to happen... it changed me a little bit. I made friends with INTJ's and INTP's. I talked to an ENTP about this sort of stuff before and he saw it as a Ti-Si loop.\n\nAnyway, I try not to think about it because I can just as easily justify being an INTP. 
2	Slayerment be like: "He mistyped himself because he's an intellectual, therefore he's clearly either an ENTP or INTP, not an ESTP or ISTP because sensors are not smart."
2	Tested INTP first time I took the test. But as I learned more about it (pretended to be INTP), just felt wrong and off. Then I started checking out examples instead of relying on those 'abstract' descriptions. And now here I am. Good shit.
2	\>staying home all day. \n\nThis kills the ESTP. 
2	Did you consider being ENTP? This sounds a lot like me, except I very clearly use Si and Ne. I may come to seemingly outrageous conclusions and dismiss counterarguments as irrelevant and this may seem like inferior Ni, but it's not. And I clearly have no Se.\n\nAt the same time however, your writing style does seem more ESTP than ENTP or INTP.
2	10 years of confusion.	I am a enfj to the fullest. Estps are strange creatures to me.\n I had this huge thing written out and realized you all won’t read it so here is the tldr version.\n\nFor ten years this guy has texted me (short and to the point) and called me. Tells me he’s in love with me when he’s drunk. Hangs around me like I’m a bro, doesn’t flirt with me but will flirt with other chicks. So I get a distinct not interested vibe unless he’s drunk and confessing his love for me. It’s been ten years and he still checks in on me with an occasional drunk I love you call. When not drunk he tells me I’m gorgeous and the best he’s ever had. \n\nSo is this estp playing me or does he have feelings for me or what?  As an enfj i don’t understand any of it. 
8	If he's kept up with you for that long, he loves you. ESTP's struggle when talking about feelings. Sometimes we need to be drunk lol
3	I've been flirted with by an ESTP, even after telling him to stop (he didn't actually notice he was doing it), when he was having a gf which he really loved, and to whom he confessed after getting drunk. Soo...  \n  \nNot to extrapolate too much, but if you feel like it why not give him a little encouragement and see if it ends well. 10y is a loong time
2	I can't imagine chasing anybody for 10 years, he definitely feels something real. Good luck getting that out of him when he's sober tho, you might just have to corner him
2	oh, geeze. Do you have feelings for him is the important part? If so it sounds like you're going to have to force the issue with him to get the truth out, sounds like he's into you but too socially awkward/inhbited to actually admit it... doesn't sound like the most emotionally mature person though! I'd be careful.
1	ENTP here but I still got that 3rd Fe goin on. Getting drunk makes it easier for me to """accidentally""" confess things, if you catch my drift
1	You sure that's an ESTP and not a Se-ISTP? ENFJs and ISTPs are in relations of "duality" in socionics, which is the ideal type match, which could be why he's been loving on you for so long in such inexplicable ways. Se-ISTPs are sometimes easy to mistake for ESTPs.
3	Penpals	anyone want to be penpals? it could be fun. \n- your dual ;-)

5	How can I cheer up my ESTP dad?	Hello. I'm an ENTP and my dad is an ESTP. Lately he's been super critical of himself and he brings himself down for every little thing he does wrong (today he almost bit into a olive pit and he ranted for 20 minutes about how he's a worthless idiot).  \n\nI feel like he has a lot of problems in his life. Lately he hasn't been doing well financially (his job is sort of seasonal, as he gains more during summer. We're not doing badly, as my mom is fine financially, but I think it contributes to him feeling worthless), he thinks my grandma's health is deteriorating, his sister has just retired (she's a little crazy and she keeps coming at our house)...  \n\nI obviously can't solve the various problems he has in his life but how can I cheer him up? Should I try and spend more time with him, or leave him alone? Any advice is welcome. 
4	Just be there for him. Talk to him and don't draw attention to the problems per se unless he brings the issues up. If he wants to spend time with you, do so. If he doesn't, respect that. When I find myself in ruts like that, I just know I'm in for a grind and I do what I can to fix my situation, but I know one day I'm going to wake up and snap out of it, because that's just how it is. \n\n\nBasically, respect his wishes and take his feedback as law. We like to handle our emotions ourselves, but sometimes we like a little help and of course it's nice to know those around us care. Just don't push, if he says no every time or you're asking too often, lay off for a while. Trust your gut but know when to set it aside and let him do his thing 
2	Dunno if this is an ongoing issue or been overcome by time....but personally I do better when I’m active AND outdoorsy. Maybe get him to join you on a walk and discuss things while out in nature? 
1	I don’t react well to people deliberately trying to cheer me up. If Im in s bad mood and someone tells me a joke to try and cheer me up it generally makes me more pissed. When I’m in a bad mood I am intensely thinking about what caused it and how to fix it. Anything that distract from my train of thought generally upsets me even more. \n\nI’d say best thing to do is just to leave him alone, maybe ask if he’s feeling better in an hour or two. Eventually he’ll come around by his own accord. \n\nYes I realise by the time I’ve written this the moment has long gone but I figured I’d put this here for future reference.

6	How to communicate with an ESTP? (INTJ request)	I'll try to keep this short, ask for more info if needed.\n\nHow do I clearly state my requirement for alone time, w/o offending.  I have an Se dom acquaintance that is asking me constantly to do things.  I try to (in my mind) clearly indicate that I can not do these highly stimulating extroverted activities all the time.  That I need time to recover...and by time, more than an hour or 24 hours, even more than 48 hours.  That once a week is my goal, and anything beyond that is 'luck' if it fits into my schedule/time line/energy alottment. \n\nI've denied many encounters, but every day/other day I'm asked again.  Its become tedious and negatively effecting energy and mood trying to manage this situation.\n\nI don't mean this rudely, but it feels clingy or needy.  Where as I'm completely fine and often prefer to do things on my own...its nice when every now and then I can hang with someone else along the way, but I don't need it every day or even every week.  Side note: They have asked or claimed to be curious to why I have been unable to meet up. Asking for an excuse...as if I need to justify my time/energy.  I think excuses are pointless, and if someones busy, they are busy. I have work/business obligations, and made these apparent. I have goals that rely on these obligations..\n\nThe more I try to state my position, the less it seems to make a difference at all. Which has me thinking its intentional at this point and they are seeking a reaction...but I'm too patient...up until I'm not...and then I disconnect.  I'm trying to avoid that.\n\nApologies, still got pretty wordy.  Any tips/suggestions welcome.
4	"I need time to myself"
3	I'd say this person either likes you romantically or thinks you're a useful end to a means. Do you have a particular skill or relationship with somebody they might be trying to get on the in with? Do you have money or other entertaining things that come along with you?\n\nOtherwise they could just be trying to be inclusive and might not really care if you decline. Sometimes I know people are happy to chill themselves and even though I'm neutral on their participation in my life's fun, I'll invite them regardless so the times when they do want to join as you say, they are still welcomed. \n\nIt's also possible they think you're upset with something they've done and are trying to get you back in their good gripes.
3	be blunt and tell them you need time to yourself. be honest. this isnt an offensive statement so dont make it into one. or just also tell them you dont want to do what theyre trying to get you to do. \n\nalso keep in mind every relationship is a cooperative thing, and I've had enough experience with intj to know you guys like to micro manage and plan everything, and it doesn't take a genius to know estp are some of the most spontaneous people you'll ever meet. your friend isn't trying to personally attack and you and ruin all your schedules and personal plans and obligations, they're just trying to hang out with you because this is how ESTP go about things. They're trying to include you. maybe you should stop thinking of it as some kind of unreasonable expectation they have on you, and try understanding it from a perspective other than your own. Ones expectations and implications of ANY given situation will not be known to everyone UNTIL THEY ARE VOICED, and you should never expect others to read your mind. This person is not inside your head, no everyone knows you're planning your day from the moment you wake up or that you have an energy expenditure limit. Talk to your friends. Communicate. Be Honest. Meet them halfway, don't expect them to know everything already. 
1	This person probably is needy and possibly is trying to get a reaction out of you. Honestly if you've already communicated your boundaries to them then they're ignoring you on purpose which is lame. Make a stronger boundary. "I will only do one thing a week with you. I'm just going to ignore any other requests" and then if they get even worse, then start shutting the relationship down because they clearly don't respect you.\n
1	Be direct, but there are chances the estp does not understand it if he/ she hasn't formed the idea of Ni.
1	Communication	I thought you guys would like this.\n\nMe (INTP) before studying 2 things:\n\nPfft! Communication isn’t that hard!\n\nMe after studying 3 things:\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-dJolYw8tnk\n\nWant to know what those 3 things are?\n\nPitch Anything (Book)\n\nMBTI\n\nStates of Mind\n\nOnce you understand pitching via functions and pitching in general, put them together, you are a beast!\n\nYou’re able to win almost every pitch! It takes practice, but it should be easiest for ESTPs.\n\nMBTI Example:\n\nWhen you’re trying to appeal to say..an INFJ, trying to appeal to their third or fourth function will end in failure every time. You want to appeal to their Ni and Fe.\n\nNow, for pitching basics...\n\n1. Pitching is not the same as salesmanship. It’s an everyday skill. It’s useful when teaching, trying to get someone to do something, and simply in everyday conversation.\n\n2. You’re not pitching to the neocortex..well at least directly. You’re pitching to the croc brain. The croc brain is the part of the brain that’s well..in a nutshell “What’s that?! Who’s there?! Ooo! Shiny!”\n\n3. When you’re pitching, if you make one wrong move, you’re done for.\n\nFinally, concerning states of mind...\n\nThere’s several states of mind, but to save time, I’ll focus on the main ones.\n\n1. A state of mind I like to call the “Super Saiyan” state of mind.\n\n2. Lucid dreaming\n\n3. A “Doer”, present-oriented state of mind. In this state of mind, you can start doing anything with virtually no resistance as long as you want to. Ex. *Typing on phone* *Wants to read a book* *Instantly throws phone at wall and picks up book like they suddenly lost all interest in phone*\n\nThese links explain how to achieve #1:\nhttps://thepunnyscientist.blogspot.com/2017/12/the-7-primary-regions-of-nerve.html?m=1\n\nhttps://thepunnyscientist.blogspot.com/2017/12/ki-chi-or-qi-explained-and-clarified.html?m=1\n\nHere’s 2: https://thepunnyscientist.blogspot.com/2017/12/how-to-lucid-dream-benefits.html?m=1\n\nHere’s 3: https://thepunnyscientist.blogspot.com/2017/12/4-major-productivity-tips-rarely.html?m=1
6	Are you trying to sell us something 
2	I think you failed your pitching.
5	What do ESTPs think of r/TheRedPill	I believe some of what they say has truth while some is bs. What do you guys think of it?
10	As a female ESTP I think its complete crap. I don't care if its 'truth', those 'tactics' dont allow for functional  relationships. ESTP's are naturally flirtatious, so if its helped your relationship...holy fuck you are/were a lost soul.
13	Mostly bullshit. While I'm sure /r9k/-types can probably get laid using Red Pill ideology, I doubt it's with anyone but the lowest common denominator (looking for money) or girls who are in a dark place emotionally (where abusive behavior is actually appealing), and I doubt it can at all foster a healthy relationship.\n\n\nAnd generally, not treating a person as a *person*, but more of a vehicle for self-gratification isn't a good idea, and speaks volumes about the emotional immaturity of one's self.
11	Trash af
5	Mostly truth, but some people are extremist and really view women as objects. It's mostly about self-improvement
3	This [standup](https://youtu.be/6KzCfIYArmQ) highlights the kind of conversation and philosophy they’d like to create for men (its goofy af).. but from what I can see - it’s kind of a circle jerk and anti-feminism
5	Seems like total crap tbh.
4	More bs than truth. Much much more
2	One of the best things to read as a man. For the love of god read the sidebar first. If you dive head first into the hot posts you will be completely out of your depth. \n\nIt’s the kind of stuff your dad should’ve taught you but probably didn’t. \n\nNot done an awful lot of good to my sex life but I’m a bit...different in that regard. \n\nImproved the interactions I have with women immeasurably. If you’re into social manipulation, which as an ESTP I’m pretty sure you are, then some stuff in there is complete gold. As with anything there is a lot of rubbish thrown around but it’s a bit of a work in progress so that’s to be expected. \n\nDon’t be so autistic as to follow it like a bible. Use what you think is useful and dismiss what you want. Most of it is completely correct though. 
2	Changed my life, started reading at 16, almost 20 now
1	I don't even know what it is, glossing the sub gave me huge walls of text that don't simply explain what it is or give an example\n\n\nProvide me that and I'll answer for ya
1	I think a lot of the comments made so far are from people that don't know much about it. Yes, extremists exist, which is why you get this air of "TRP is for assholes and they treat women like garbage!" However, if you actually read the sidebar and dig into the core value of what is taught, there can be a lot of benefits... for everyone.\n\nIt teaches to focus on oneself. Make yourself the priority. Don't focus on garnering outside approval, or being popular. Focus on what YOU want in life, and go for it. You do need to ignore a lot of the comments, and focus on "Endorsed" posts and sidebar content. The core tenants don't speak about treating women poorly - - unless you consider not standing up for yourself by setting healthy boundaries and sticking to them as such. \n\nAs an ESTP, I find a lot of help in TRP from these concepts, but I do take a lot of what's said with a grain of salt. \n\nJust my opinion.
0	Suggestion for banner	Hey guys, do you approve of this photo as your banner? let's vote on it. if anyone else has a suggestion, post it here \nhttps://imgur.com/g6fqE8y 
6	Eh, no for that banner. I get that we seem like daredevils ond hyper masculine to other types, but many totally negate our Ti since we're in our heads quite a bit. \n\nMaybe a picture of confetti? Cuz were amazing, but can annoy others if we stay around too long.
5	No.  \nThis isn't a street racing sub.
5	No

5	ISTP dating an ESTP	I'm an ISTP and have just started dating an ESTP, we've been going out for two weeks...any suggestions on how I should navigate these waters?
7	Just be yourself. If it doesn't work out, it wasn't meant to be and move on.
3	Everyone is different, figure it out yourself
3	Lol and ISTPs complain about relationship questions invading their sub... Or is this just all of mbti?
2	Don't try. Never try. I get it, I always end up trying too, but just don't. If it works it works, if it doesn't then it was never meant to be. But also don't try to not try lol, just let yourself have as little control as possible.
1	Should go well, my favorite people are ISTP
11	Post that isn't a relationship question or survey	What's up yall
5	I just got off work... I didnt want to go in but I knew a lot of other wouldnt be in... Stress free day.\n\nI booked a cruise to Mexico for a birthday gift to myself. I'm going on a financial diet to get some debts down, so I pretty much Mardi Gras'd my bank account to prepare for lean times. *deadpans*\n\nHappy New Years to everyone. Watch fireworks, be safe, and stay warm!
2	AY it's going well for me\n\nWhat're all y'alls plans for New Years?\n\nI was gonna hit a party up with some good friends of mine.
2	Visiting some internet randoms in MN. I'm from Canada. My fucking flight was delayed so I couldn't connect on time. Waiting in the Toronto Airport for another 9 hours. I enjoy this kind of time because it's basically free time from life without the guilt. Lel.
1	just in nevada, i think.\nheaded to california in a few days.\nthen maybe north?
1	All is good for me on my end just spending time with family until the spring semester starts, but I am working during New Years 
9	I feel that I’m not really a person who settles on likes and dislikes and that I’m an adapter. I had no one set form. I’m whatever I need to be or whatever the situation calls for. If I’m required to work very hard my likes and dislikes change to things of that nature. Vice versa with laziness. ????	
4	Annnnd
3	That's not a bad thing. If you weren't a social chameleon, you probably wouldn't have ended up where you are today. 
2	i feel this too much.. bc of it, when i was younger i felt i lacked identity. now i see it as a strength. \n
2	A person living for 18 years or more and you think you have no likes or dislikes? You do. You're just not listening. 
3	Test With Functions	Hi :) Couple weeks ago I asked for a help with testing one personality test. A lot of people told to use cognitive functions. We did it. Please try test again and comment your result. \n\nIt's Free. No registration required. Congitive functions used. :) \n\nhttps://www.horozo.com/personality-type-test
1	The only difference in mine is that I usually get nearly 100% Se, but this one I didn't, thinking was slightly higher as well, whereas it's usually slightly lower than Se
1	Avoid double negatives in your questions: "\nMy mood doesn't change very quickly." No vs Yes. \n"My mood changes very quickly," Or, "My mood changes slowly," is easier to answer.
3	How can I become the best friend of an ESTP?	\nWhat are your guys 'criteria' for a friend?\n\nWhat are the things/characteristics that you think are the most important to have in a friend? \n\nWhat do you expect from a friend?\n\nAnother question: Do/will you ESTPs have lieing and manipulative type of people in your circle of friends? The ones that break the rules? Do you actually perceive them as a real friend?
10	Ok, for 'best friend' those are people i have long history with. You don't become a 'best friend' through personal effort or coolness.\n\ni'm the ESTP who adopts introverts and drags them to things they really don't want to be doing... street festivals, axe throwing, bars...\n\nYou need to bring some utility to the relationship. Maybe that's killer music recommendations, or you're a great shopping partner, maybe you're great with my kids and willing to babysit once in a while, maybe you're an expert in something I find interesting, maybe you can diagnose that weird noise my car is making. If you need a lot of help and attention from me, but don't bring anything yourself, I'm going to get tired of that real fast. \n\nI've got some real sketchy friends I adore. But they treat people decently they just might use drugs or scam their car insurance company. 
5	a friend for me is someone who I can really just hang out with and do anything with that I trust.\n\nTo me an important characteristic is that if I get into a fight they jump in the fight with me. I'd do the same for them and to me it says a lot about loyalty. My best friends are family to me I see them as brothers.. And my girl bestfriends as my baby's.. \n\nI hate lying manipulative people and avoid them like the plague. I have no problem with people I know doing it to others just not to me. I'm kind of partial like that. IDGAF how my friends are so long as they're good to me, I accept them.\n\nPeople who break the rules with me are awesome. I trust them more.. Cause I know I'd be down to help them do something illegal if it was really important. Like this mfker wronged my homie and we're about to set the score straight. That's what I mean.
2	That's such a broad question \n\n\n\nMy friends are people who don't suck. If you're a boner and are completely uninteresting, are dissimilar in more ways than not, etc, yeah it's not gonna work. Loyalty and honesty above all else, followed by being fun in a close third.\n\n\nNo, and ffs we're not just super liars and manipulators 24/7. Breaking the rules is fun if they're the rules you want to break and when you want to break them, otherwise it's annoying. Yes?

7	ESTPs: If an ESTP invited me does that mean they like me?	At school, the ESTP told me to join the activity that he is at, but the time he told me my attention was at the person next to him who was talking to me (and than they walked away) and so I couldn't reply. \n\nI'm just wondering, I know ESTPs will be fine with anyone (as long as they are not shy, suck, etc). So does it also mean he likes me/or just think I am cool?\n\nAnother small question without details, do ESTPs usually say sorry? How will you show someone you are sorry of what you abve did? Especially if it's an accident.
10	Means they don't dislike you \n\n\n\nI don't apologize unless I'm actually sorry 
4	Depends! we love to be surrounded by anyone and everyone, more opportunities to make friends and connections! now for the apology part of it, depends, because my prideful ass wont apologize to anyone, yet my girlfriend has to tell me to stop apologizing lol 
1	I don't ask people to hang out that I don't like. If I find someone boring or just a drag in general like a real prude I'm never inviting them to anything even though I might be cool with them. I don't say sorry unless I really mean it and it was truly an accident.
1	Yes, for me to give an invite I would already like you or want to get to know you more. In my social circle, I'm around a lot of reserved people/introverts and I find them pleassnt to be with. I think having a positive outlook is better critera of who'd we want to hang with. I know I exhaust my introverted friends, but luckily, estps arent ones to hover over friends.\n\nI dont say 'sorry' because guilt and shame dont serve a purpose to me. I do see where I've wronged someone, messed a situation up, or I try to fix it before they notice the accident (we're quick thinkers and improvisers). \n\nIf it was a less serious accident, lets say I chipped a friend's gravy boat, I'd probably explain how it happened. I'd say:  I thought I had a tighter grip instead of saying I'm sorry for chipping the dish. I'd probably go buy her a new one and throw in a joke or two. \n\n
7	[x-post r/MBTI] Some choice advice for ESTPs by ESTPs that's worth linking to	
2	Probably not made [**of ESTPs**](https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/undertale/images/f/fb/Product_UT_spiderbakesale_poster_main_1024x1024_cr.jpg) but who knows
3	Reaching out to ESTP	Hey! ESFP here.\n\nWent on a great date with ESTP, wine tasting, bar, fast forward to great sex. Texted all day last Friday, met up on Saturday at mine, watched movie , more fun sex. He mentioned making plans for another activity : swimming and dinner, once he's back from oot. \nIts been a week and haven't heard from him- should I reach out and what to say? Something playful? \nI really like this guy, but I know estps generally like their space and don't get emotionalally involved very quickly etc. Any suggestions would be appreciated. I mean I realize this could be done on his end, and don't want to come off poorly. \n\nThanks! 
6	There are two options. Either you do nothing and trust that he is indeed making plans to get together. If he reaches out to you, then good. But if not, then keep the attitude of 'someone who doesn't reach out to me doesn't deserve me'.  \n\nOr you send him 1 short text to ask how he is doing or something playful, but do not mention anything about meeting up. He must bring it up himself whether it is immidiatly or after a few days. That way you can have some kind of feeling how much he likes you. If he doesn't make plans soon after you reach out, then I don't think you are his 'top priority' 
5	Text him but do it casually
3	Need a little help :)	Hello, guys :) I'm MBTI fan and trying to help my friend. He own small social network where main feature is Questions Game - people talk to each with pre-prepared questions or use their own questions list. The main idea to filter users and show related members are totally oposite options: 1) compatible members by zodiac sign 2) compatible by personality type. So, he created personality test which contains 32 questions. I want you to ask to take that test and tell is it accurate or not :) \n\nYou don't need to create an account or login to take test, but you can create it if you like the idea and want to try other features :) So, link to test is: \n\nhttps://www.horozo.com/personality-type-test\n\nAny comments, ideas, critics are welcome!
1	I took both the test for MBTI and for zodiac, but I still feel like I'm missing the point..\n\nI was accurately typed as both an INFJ and a Capricorn, but outside of just telling you it was accurate, I don't know how that's really helpful.
4	Do you ESTPs prefer having 1 BFF or just some random people to have fun?	Am an INFJ, I want to friend this dude in my school, he is an ESTP. \n\nBut I fear that I will be like just a random person to him. He does indeed smile at me and make jokes around me (and will look at and smile to see if I am laughing on his goofyness). IDK I just want to know if I cqn actually be his best friend forever, he does have about 3 friends who he always plan their trips with, i just want to know some idea of your friendships.
8	I have a core group of friends. Outside of that, I'm down for random people or people I'm not super close to as long as they don't suck 
5	This is weird, do people need to be in a committed lifelong relationship? Can't we just hang out whenever? 
2	I've got a small group that I'd consider my true friends, but I certainly don't turn people away (unless they're not nice people).  I say go for it, but don't expect a true bromance or whatever the female version is.

3	CONSPIRACY THEORIES & ESTP	Hi, I'm doing a little research on personality types and conspiracy theories and if different personalities are drawn more towards certain conspiracy theories or if its just a completely individual thing to follow certain conspiracy theories. It would be great if you in the ESTP community could respond to me about if you follow any conspiracy theories and if you dont. Thanks!!
7	None
6	None. We are more into perception and experience not theories. 
4	>you in the INFJ community \n\nLaazy.
2	You need to define conspiracy theories. I got told multiple times recently that I'm peddling conspiracy theories when I'm actually just not being stupid.
2	Drawing a blank here
1	None.
6	making friends	anyone got any tips? i'm hoping you guys will give some advice more along my line of thinking. \n\nI dont want a day to day friend, just someone to go adventuring with every couple of months or so, sharing airbnbs in different countries, that sort of thing. shooting the shit with someone on a friday night down the pub would be pretty nice though.\n\nAll my uni friends have moved away and got gfs so arent interested in going on holiday with me :(\n\nso yeah, any ideas? thanks.
5	The normal way everyone does: meet something in pursuit of something both of you like
3	Right away make sure that person has similar availability and finances. Pick a hobby where you would meet people like that. I have a few solid close friends, but since high-school our careers have shifted so wildy from each other that it's hard to make such travel plans.
2	Join a community (a hobby you enjoy, classes to learn new skills) and meet people in that way. \n\nHow to talk to people:\n\nStart with a compliment, usually mine are genuine. I try not to force compliments LOL\nMake a statement about whatever activity you’re doing, or the weather, basic small talk. Ask people for help with something, basically find ways to connect with someone. Ask person if they like dogs and show them a cute picture, idk whatever method works for u. \n\nIntroduce yourself and get their name. Ask them about themselves. Ppl like to talk about themselves. Remember stuff about them. Make sure to make the connection the next time you see them (say hi, ask them if they want to see another dog photo) Voila, you have made a “friend.”\n\nGet to know different people through this method and find the people you have something in common with in terms of wanting to travel to the same place or whatever, and bring up your plans. Ask if they are interested in going on a said trip with you. Plan trip together, book trip, and go.\n\nObviously not right away bc that’s weird and a trip is a big investment to go on if you just met a person unless you both really are just dying to go \n\nIt helps to just do interest checks and keep who might be interested in mind to maintain a friendship with here and there in the event you get the chance to make the trip happen.\n\nI make friends by inviting people to do things with me once I know what they are interested in. There might be people who have never hiked before. Ask them if they would want to try it out and make it happen (bc we’re very good at that)\n\nI tend to get to know people more and build lots of rapport along the way of doing activities with them. (I like to go on food adventures and most people are down to try new food experiences) \n\nHow to maintain new friendships: keep doing things with them once in a while, or what I like to do is just check in through social media every now and then, ask how they are doing and show interest in them as a person (again, building rapport even tho I might not necessarily be able to relate), send another dog photo while ur at it\n\nDon’t forget to occasionally share a cool link to a fun thing in place you want to visit to entice new friend, and say let’s go ! \n\nHope that helps ~\nI used to be a socially awko taco INFP but now I stopped living in my head and I test as ESTP. Go figure. Also, as ESTP I am constantly looking for ppl to do things with just bc it’s more fun. I’m not sure about the whole wanting to do things alone bit for ESTP. \n
1	Okay - novadays you have more options to meet people than ever. \n\nI'd recommend find a local groups on social media/forums/even here, based on your interests. Especially if you want to travel, first meetings were sometimes akward, but I always found people amongs bigger groups that suited me. 
6	[ESTP]Anger	Hi Folks,\nI'm female ESTP and just figured out my bahaviour when I'm really pissed off. The fun fact is this is really rare 'cause I'm not that emotional. Nevertheless, sometimes I'm really pissed off - and nobody wants to be near once I have this state of mind. \n\nIt's really hard to say why I'm angry, this is like "snap" and here you go, I'm really angry and unintentionaly, awaiting for anyone who bother me so I can really snap at him/her. I figured out that I can be pissed off once someone won't take his responsibilities seriously or someone is pinging me and asking about something trivial - and I set my mind into complex issues. Normally, I would gladly assist (if it's within my scope) but if I have a lot questions like that and I see that someone doesn't want to learn then I'm really agressive.\n\nTo calm down I need my space, 1 or 2 hours when no one is trying to ask me anything. If someone asks "hey, something wrong?" - I will definetly snap, but I never bring personal details in quarell, only competences/skills/facts - or rather lack of skill. I always hit where hurt the most.\n\nAre you also like me? I'm becoming more introvertic (don't want to have contact with people, don't want to interract), at the same time i'm short-tempered, I will snap and give everything I got just to silence someone so he doesn't bother me. \n\nI don't have any trouble to explain situation after I calm down and say sorry, nevertheless I'm thinking if there is any possibility to control this behaviour?\n\nDo you have similar experience? Any advice? \n
3	>"hey, something wrong?"\n\nholy fuck this shit right here. The last thing I want to do in this state of mind is to have to explain to some dipshit why i'm so pissed off. just fuck off and let me sort this shit out on my own. 
3	[deleted]
2	Yeah I've got the same.\n\nIt sucks, on normal days I have no problem in explaining what's up. Even without someone asking.\n\nHowever, when I'm in a bad mood, I really need to try not to snap, stay calm, and find a way to explain what's up.\n\nWhat works for me, is to try and think of the consequences of what I say and how it influences my reputation towards others.\nMost of the time I already know what I want to say, and how I can say what I think in such a way that the message gets across, without other people looking down upon me.
1	nah man. if someone ask me what's up and I'm not angry at them im not gonna snap. I just say im good and leave it at that even tho im obviously pissed. I just dont feel like talking about it but i appreciate them checking in on me and let them know that. Unless it's one of my really close friends who I know understands me.. Then I may vent a little.\n\nhonestly whoever I'm angry at, (I'm getting better at this) but I don't like to express my emotions towards them unless it's love type feelings. Like expressing my infatuation. If it's anger, I don't speak to them at all. I'm more think over what I should do and then I act. There are no words most times. But a lot can be solved by talking about things which I'm learning now even though I neglected it in the past. I'd rather throw punches than argue \n\nBTW I sort of just skimmed ur post. If I didnt answer ur question whatever i guess. hope this helps
5	I'm INFP and and madly in love with a ESTP ( I think) man anything I need to know? Can it work?	This relationship is pretty new and we're both coming out of terrible relationships. He says it was love at first sight. I was attracted to him right away. Aside from the immediate physical attraction, I was attracted to his charm, confidence, friendliness and his charisma. He'll help anyone out with anything they need and has the biggest heart. \n\nI feel like we are complete opposites, he's very social and out going, I'm a little quiet and prefer a quiet evening at home. He's confident in everything he does, I'm full of self doubt. He's good at everything he does especially anything physical, I'm more of a deep thinker and I'm pretty clumsy. So you would think that we can't be compatible. However, I adore his strength and he loves my humility.  I think hes attracted to my soft gentle nature and my sense of humor also, my dreamy imagination. He also likes to take control and take care of any need I might have.\n\nI can see that control becoming an issue, he wants to have a hand in every aspect of my life. When we first met i worked as a sales rep for a calling center working 6 days a week up to 13 hours a day. The pressure to make sales really stressed me out and he wanted me home more so we could spend more time together. He told me 'let me take care of you.' So he convinced me to quit my job (I'm kinda a push over) now he wants to spend every minute together. He even takes me to work with him helping at the job site leveling houses. Do ESTP tend to get obsessive?\n\nI see some temper in him too. The other night at a friend's house some drunk guys were there trying to grab my butt and being just gross to me. He didn't even hesitate to throw the guy on the ground and punch him repeatedly. Sure the drunk guy was being a douchebag but I don't want him in jail. Is temper something I have to worry about?\n\nI'm madly in love with him I would just like to know what other ESTPs have to say and if you have had any experience with an INFP woman and what I should look out for. Any advice? Thanks!
8	You should be careful with this relationship. Doesn't matter what the MBTI says, all of these traits seem to scream manipulative.\n\nYou said you could see control taking over the relationship and him even offering to take care of you - abusers will try to isolate you (make you stop hanging around friends, make you quit your job so you're always at home with no income to support yourself without him, etc..) \n\nThe aggressive behavior sounds like he's possessive because he could have simply talked to the guy or just removed you from the situation calmly, especially at a party. 
4	Hey, something seems off about this to me too. You mentioned control, obsession, and acting out on feelings of jealousy, (instead of talking about it). One of those behaviors by itself could be attributed to a bit of immaturity or a personal development issue, but this combination could be something more serious. I read everything you posted so far. \n\nConsider individual or group therapy to help you sort this out. A psychologist with a PhD or anyone with an interest in scientific research is probably your best bet. A book by Lundy Bancroft: "Why Does He Do That?: Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men". I believe the author is also an INFP. And stay employed. More than just an income, a job serves as an anchor for your health and well being in many ways.  \n

2	You need to check if you can resist his "orders" and if you can manage to change his mind or at least slow him down until you're sure it's what *you* want. If not I suggest looking for someone else :I
0	the Meyer Briggs stuff has been proven to be bullshit. 
2	hey i was wondering....	since you guys have se doesnt that mean meditation comes easily to you guys?,since se is all about being one with the moment?whats your experinces of this?,and does living in the moment make you happier?
2	There's no measurable way to determine if it's easier for any given person or people, that's impossible to answer. I was Buddhist for a few years and meditating was just a norm\n\nYes.
2	The present can still get to u i mean something happening in the moment that isn't cool can make us unhappy. Like damn I was looking forward to going to a water park today and it started raining! fuckkk! I was so in the mood for that.. Or damn I really wanted to go to chik fil a and it's a fucking sunday!! shit! lmao 
6	Self employed or small business owner ESTPs, what do you do for a living?	I'm a female ESTP and considering a career change. I have been a manager in small business my entire life, and self employed for the last 3 years. I am looking for a total career change and want to hear what you do and how much you like (or don't like) it.  Thanks!\n\n**Editing to add my own past career. I do not have higher education. I was a dental practice manager for 14 years. I now manage a small service business.  
4	I'm military and am about to graduate college to be a teacher and coach. \n\n\nI'll take stereotypes for $600, Alex
3	I’m an ESTP and the National Technical Director for a  franchise company called Colors On Parade \nWe teach automotive paint and dent repair and have 300 employees nation wide and are looking to expand aggressively over the next few years \nDM your location if you’re interested and I can get you in touch with an area developer.\nIt’s a very good living and fulfills the need for creativity and new challenges/change ESTPs have to have to keep from restlessly leap from job to job.
3	Im self employed with various "jobs". Im naturally good at creative problem solving, so everything I do is an extension of that:\n\n- Music Producer for other artists and also have my own project/band (this is my primary pursuit, but unfortunately this isnt terribly lucrative lol)\n- Design/Visual Branding Director for a dance company + freelance graphic design/branding (this is my main "job")\n- IT/AV Supervisor for a gym (this is my other "job")\n\nThe gym is the only place I have to be "at work" regularly and it's 2 days a week. Everything else I can do from anywhere as long as I have my laptop. \n\nI need diversity on a day to day basis or I get very bored. I started finding success (and much more money) when I realized I should list my goals and work backward from there, rather than trying to fit myself into the rules of "normal" society. \n\nIf youve never read it, I would heavily recommend Tim Ferriss' [4 Hour Work Week](https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357) Its a great starting point.

1	Do any ESTP's own a massage therapy or wellness practice ?  I'd love to learn more about your setup. 
3	Past experiences negatively affecting present circumstances?	I feel like past situations where I experienced a large amount of stimulation/arousal/fun tend to influence my current decision making/thinking process that aims to recreate those circumstances and often times this detracts from the now/present and negatively affects my ability to enjoy it and the relationships I have with friends and family. I think problems arise when people think I have a hidden motive that I don't share but often even I don't realize what I'm doing its more subconscious level. And I myself don't feel good doing this since I feel deceitful/guilty when doing this even though I feel my intentions aren't evil. \n\nDo I just have really bad anxiety? The only time I can truly enjoy the present and now is when I smoke weed but I don't want to smoke weed everyday maybe I just need to recreate the effects of weed in a more natural way but I don't know if I want to be on anti anxiety medication. I'm definitely an ESTP since I've been tested multiple times across different moods/time periods. I guess I'm just an ESTP who's bad at being an ESTP. Does anyone understand what I'm trying to say? 
3	How old are you?
3	You have got yourself into a Ti loop. Lay down on the ground and let yourself get pulled down by gravity. That is real... right now. Nothing in the past matters. You need to look forward and recognize what opportunity is ahead. It will get better if you strive for new experiences and focus on living. Push the past aside and your world will open up again. ESTP is a wired existence because we enjoy thinking but if we do it to much we hate ourselves. 
1	I feel like I just read the past two years of my life and continuing... Wow. I'm high right now reading this and it really opened my eyes. 
1	Maybe you're [in the grip of the inferior](http://personalitycafe.com/sps-temperament-forum-creators/58243-form-inferior-function-esps.html). Since you're less able to enjoy the present, that means Se isn't working well. Your shadow functions may be clicking on. I think this might be Si here: \n\n>past situations where I experienced a large amount of stimulation/arousal/fun tend to influence my current decision making/thinking process that aims to recreate those circumstances\n\nAfter prolonged stress, your preferred functions can become exhausted. When that happens, shadow functions will kick in to help out with the cognitive load. For an ESTP, your personality would change and become similar to that of an ISTJ. But you would be an inefficient version of that type. \n\nIf you think that might be it, do some further reading. The standard advice for recovery is to avoid stress, eat well, light activity, and get plenty of rest.  
8	Upset/Sad when friends hang out without me	Does anyone else feel bad when people you consider friends hang out without you and don't invite you to social gatherings? I feel like I have to invite myself over but I don't want to do that because its BM.  Its not that they stopped hanging out its that I guess they don't consider me to be a vital enough part of their group that I get an invite. I just want to hang out with people and have fun, but I guess I need new friends.\n\ngod damn it's so hard moving on. I think I've been a core part of 4 friend groups in my 2.5 years in college but I always end up moving on when I stop seeing those people in my life regularly and then I just stop all communication with them apart from the awkward hellos when you see them passing by. I hate being by myself its so depressing, I love hanging out with cool people but making new friends is not something I like to commit myself to doing.\n\n
9	Nope. I’m too busy to notice and if I notice, I invite myself next time because why wouldn’t they want me there ? if they don’t want me there fuck them! 
3	Yo I feel you brother. I wonder the same things myself and maybe you’re right. Maybe you do need new friends. I guess it depends on how much time you’ve spent with them and how much you care about them ya know. How committed you are. And how much they care about you. Do they ever not invite someone else? Is this common behavior for them?
2	Oftentimes, when someone starts to question a friendship like that, it's because they've been overthinking things. \n\nWhen that happens, there arises feelings of angst between the two friends when they do hangout. This can create a loop of confusion between the friends as they both tend to wonder, "hmmm, he's been acting weird around me. Maybe he doesn't wanna be my friend anymore." This misconception causes the friends to start distancing themselves from each other.\n\n\nSo, what's the solution? Open yourself up, be a good friend to these people, invite them to hang out, stop worrying about it all. Leave no room for misconceptions.\n\n
1	In my experience, they might not have invited you because:\n\n-Maybe it was a last-minute thing that just happened??\n\n-You just joined their group, so they still don't feel that comfortable with you???\n\n-Someone who was there doesn't like you and when someone else brought up if they should invite you they shut it down.\n\n-They think you're  too cool for them and that you probably already have plans?? (tbh, idk if this ever happens but saying this to myself makes me feel better at night when this shit continues to happen and I know I need to move on to a different friend group)\n\n-Unless this happens every week, you're probably overthinking it
4	How to flirt?	Yo, I'm an ENTP and I have kind of a difficult time with flirting. I'm not afraid to tell a girl that I like her or anything, and women tell me all the time that they find me attractive... I guess my problem comes with closing the deal. I feel like I flirt, the girl starts to like me, but then I just hit this brick wall where it becomes a cycle. How do you guys go about closing the deal with someone? 
7	Keep it simple, fun, casual.\n\n"Hey! You're cute, Let's a grab a drink!"\n\nEdit: Actually after rereading your post it seems like you're situation is to how to keep the ball rolling? Ask more questions about her, if it feels right initiate playful physical contact or give her a kiss on the cheek.
3	I tell the guy he's kind of cute and he should take me out :/ \n\n
1	aye man just say wassup baby you got a fat ass booty LMAOOO thats what i do but thats prob not what ur looking for. I'm just super blunt. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt but thats life 
2	your experience with loops?	thought estp for a little while but with bad ti, so i wanna see what your loops look like first hand. 
1	You can't see mine... but you can hear them. I usually call them sequences though. Thanks Teenage Engineering
1	Program  and sequence all my own. Who needs another loop from over sampled garbage anyhow. If music makes  itself its not music
6	Thoughts on unnecessary secretive tendencies?	I find that I am a person who keeps my opinions, and especially motivations, to myself. This is probably due in some part to being perceivers with auxillary Ti.\n\nWith that being said I feel there are times where this behavior gets out of hand, to the point of arousing suspicion.  Sometimes the information I'm hiding isn't particularly of importance, just normal stuff that transpires in the flow of a normal conversation between friends or a partner, so I'm not sure why I'm so hellbent on witholding it. \n\nI can only speculate that I'm someone who has trust issues or is paranoid, and as a result have subconsciously made it a point to never show my hand unless I have to. \n\nWould appreciate some insights on this matter, from any type. 
3	I do that too. I don't wear my opinions on my sleeve and only give them when asked or if I started the conversation 
3	Yep I do this. For some reason it makes some people upset that I don't spill the beans on my entire life. Fuck em. 
3	Lol that sounds very similar. I find I keep things to myself so much that it starts to arouse suspicions in other people. I've been called "paranoid" by others - but the source is not fear. I've been 'under' a few times so it's not like I'm fretting for my life, next to never scared of my own nightmares, neither a fan of conspiracy theories. I've traced the root source down to an excessive need for control, and following up the chain - power. Playing your hand too close is a great way to ensure that you stay in control of any situation. If you're doing this excessively, it's a signal that the need for control has superseded normal social needs and give-and-take between people. Breaking out of the pattern requires letting in control and allowing some chaos into your life. One technique to do that is visualizing yourself as a brush that the universe uses a paint a canvas, a passive participant used by fate to create a particular story or chain or events.           \n    \nThis private behavior does have a relation to MBTI's Ti and is more typical among [ESTPs of Ti-subtype](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=SLE_subtypes#Logical_subtype_Ti-ESTp_.28Ti-SLE.29).
3	Not wanting to share opinions and motivations is Fe. It's conflict avoidance and a striving for social harmony.  Say for instance, if you were to open up and share your political opinions in a crowded room. Someone is likely to get upset or think less of you. So Fe doesn't want you to share and you feel a certain resistance. \n\nFi handles conflict directly. It digs its heels in when a value is violated. [Something like this.](https://youtu.be/Jln3mi0vfJU?t=13) lol \n\nFi is low in your stack, in position #7. It's exhausting to use a function in position #7, if you can even consciously access it. This gives you the motivation to avoid conflict, and using you tert Fe is easy and enjoyable anyway. Tertiary is said to be the playful, or energizing function. So yeah, Fi feels bad, and using Fe is satisfying. \n\nTi is ofc an introverted function and it's resistant to sharing its thought process. Ti doms are known to struggle with expressing their ideas as well. For Ti to put itself 'out there' and be used externally (thinking out loud) isn't natural or easy. \n\nGenerally people do not recognize how much thought ESTPs put into everything they do. You guys are sometimes misperceived to be impulsive actors, when nothing could be further from the truth. \n\nThat's my take on it. I don't have any advice. I don't know if extroverted functions can be used to help with this or not. Maybe. I'll leave it to your capable Ti to figure something out. :)\n\n
2	Yes and it's annoying as fuck
1	For me I keep my deepest motivations for doing anything and everything secret. From really everyone. Doesn’t really cause any strife - people don’t know what or that I’m withholding anything, really. Just keeps them from totally understanding how I work and why. 
8	Anyone get antsy in meetings? Or when someone is taking too long to leave?	
3	The first 10 minutes of a meeting I'm good, but then its all down hill. I either have to fidget, draw or stand up in the back of the room to take notes. Luckily I'm in a health related field so standuping instead of sitting is encouraged. \n\nThe WORST is when you're not even in the convo, but someone is blocking the exit or it would be awkward to pass them. \n\nI think it boils down to feeling trapped in an open area, cuz technically that's whats happening.
2	oh god yes. meetings that run long or cover relatively boring material...I've actually gotten up to "use the restroom" just to go do something else for a few mins.
1	I'm usually fine in meetings as long as the subject matter somewhat interests me and the talk is productive. As far as waiting for people to leave, absolutely. I get especially mad when we set a designated a time to leave and they're still getting ready 5 mins after that time but I'm ready. That's just asking for me to bitch.
1	OMG, yes ALL THE TIME!!!!!! Especially when the person is taking a long time reiterating the same point over and over. Omg the worst!!!! 
1	This describes my existence. Hate long meetings. Be gone already. 
3	Physical/emotional disconnect	Are other estp's finding going beyond a hook up/fwb difficult because the sex itself means so little to you? 
2	hook ups/fwb relationship are done for the purpose of sex when sex is more important than having serious committed relationships or just no time for the later. if sex means little then why be in a fwb?
2	I never lie and tell women I'm not looking for a relationship. 
1	Haven't run into that, lead by my demeanor.
1	ESTP sx 8w7 here \nI don’t know if it’s the sex for me, most of the time, it’s the person. I’m just never interested in long term commitments in general. I never cared that much about relationships; friendships absolutely, relationships rarely. I also never felt the need to tell the person I’m not looking for long term because often times my actions are starkly obvious. I’m just not that into you!\nLove & commitment requires softness, vulnerability and a level of surrender; none of which sound appealing to me. My worst fears in fact!
1	Many men, and some women, are able to disconnect feelings and attachment from sex. I don’t think it’s a bad thing (to each their own) because it makes things a lot less complicated. 
4	ESTP profile by Zamanskaya (Socionics SLE "Zhukov")	
8	ESTP in college?	ESTP here. Throughout high school everything came naturally to me. I never had to study because that material was never difficult enough for me to get bad grades. \nI'm now in my Sophomore year of college and have little to no motivation to do any better than just pass my classes. I just got a new job through my school that I really love so usually in my free-time I just go to work. Whenever it comes to be time to study I end up getting food, taking a nap, basically doing anything BUT studying.\nAny other ESTP's have this issue? Any advice as to how to cope?
6	Get tested for ADHD. I was in denial. Signs were all there. Best decision I've ever made. Aderall stayed true to its nickname "maderall" its good but I'd avoid it. Vyvanse has been a blessing
5	Pick a major you like and it'll be way better when class is interesting and you want to go
6	I struggled through college, but I can guarantee it is better than the "real" world. Having a degree will make life soooooo much easier after college, for example I'm currently in the middle of leaving my current job for a new gig, because I have a masters degree I'll be starting at $10k more per year than I otherwise would be, and the guy that I believe would be the best replacement in my current position most likely won't get a chance because he doesn't have a degree, even though he has a way better work ethic and tons of real life experience. \n\nJust for practical reasons you better buckle down so you don't fuck your 40 year old self. 
2	Throughout life you're going to find that your time will be most valuably spent on researching and identifying your motivation and ambitions.\n\nYou can pass because it's routine to you. But you won't excel because there's no point in your mind at the moment.\n\nYou need to invent a reason to excel if you want to maximize your life and challenge yourself.\n\nSpend some time conceiving what that is.\n\nToughest part of life as an estp is I'm full if potential but it's left untapped. Motivation and ambition solves that.
1	College was pretty much the death of my extroverted sensing function, you just gotta grin and bear it unfortunately. 
1	Honestly, for an ESTP I've always been really good at school, but when I got to college I also lost some motivation because I hated every class. My advice for you would be to join a fraternity. There will be a bunch of guys who are currently in your major so it's easy to just hold each other accountable and form study groups. Additionally, because some of the brothers have been in your major they have test banks, which makes it much easier to study for exams.
1	Lots of stupid subject matter honestly.
1	I answered all the questions right to get prescribed adderal freshman year (6.5 years ago). That did the trick. Still prescribed (Vyvanse now). It’s how you cheat the system, but it was my method. I had / still have the same motivation “don’t give a f***” personality. I still have some growing as a person / ESTP  to do. 
3	What are some of your philosophical thoughts on Transgenders and Homosexuality?	
9	I was going to say basically the same thing tnew12 said. ESTPs have little to no interest in philosophy or anything that's not readily applicable. \n\nHaving said that, I wouldn't want my kids to be gay or trans. Mainly because I would like to have a home-life as relaxed as possible and if they're gay or trans that comes with a lot of f*cking drama, which I hate. But since they're my kids I'd have to support them or try to help them.\n\nHowever, I believe anyone can sleep and marry whoever they want. I really couldn't care less.
6	Government shouldn't regulate conflicts of ideology.  People should sort out their own problems, and form groups based on like minded values.  \n\nTransgenderism/homosexuality is irrelevant; the ability, skillset, and responsibility accepted by the individual is more important.  Can they get a job, are they go getters?  Do they manipulate people or become depressed?  Do they have a passion and act on it in a way that is healthy for them and others?\n\nAs an ESTP, these are my concerns.
5	Estp's in philosophy dont usually go hand in hand, but I get your question. I find that estps avoid drama and arent nosey.\n\nIts none of my business honestly. I wouldn't want my kids to like the same gender or want to change genders because of the stress, discrimination and heartache they'd most likely face throughout their life. \n\nIts not my place to judge the sins of others. Point blank. If someone tried to convince me that my lifestyle is wrong, I'd probably tell to screw a blender and go on with my day.
4	You do you but I don't have to agree with it, that's anything
2	Philosophy I always found to be masturbation of the mind. There's no point thinking of stuff you can't possibly comprehend.
1	I honestly wouldn't care if someone is a transgender or homosexual. What I do believe is that we all can co exist. As others said, while I wouldn't want my kids to be trans or homosexual, I believe I would still support them. 
1	Enfp here. My Estp is depressed	hi, my estp is depress feels like he cant do anything. we are currently in a long distance relationship. he doesnt want to talk and is having a rough time with life. he has a hard time accepting help and right now everything I do feels like pressure. I want to help but dont know how to. How do you guys deal with depression? what can I do to help?
8	Its not too uncommon for estp's to get depressed, sometimes out of no where. For me, if i'm super busy without ample 'me' time, I feel completely drained from others and all I wanna do is be a negitive nancy.\n\n\nThe saddness shouldn't last too long, as we are good at pushing feelings aside.When expressing emotions, I make them physical. If they also do this you are going to read between the lines (or even better, bluntly ask why he is upset/disappointed/angry). For example, if I'm anxious, I'll probably say something like, I dont feel well or I have a headache. Its true, but doesnt really get to the source of the low mood.\n\nMaybe you can take a trip up to see your SO, and do something active/outdoorsy to lift his spirit.\n
1	Get him to engage his Fe function, rather than deny it. It'll make him more aware which will push him out of it. 
5	Are ESTP's known for having bad memory?	Does anyone else have a really bad memory?\n\nSometimes when I'm having a conversation with someone, I'll lose my train of thought or forget what the conversation was even about later that day. Or I'll go into a room and forget what I was going to get. Or forget where I parked.\n\nHowever, when it comes to tests my memory is on f*cking point. I'll study the day before or of the test and pass with flying colors.\n\nIs anyone else's memory like this?
3	I think this boils down at what each person's brain find important information and what's not. So someone might find one conversation important to keep while others you won't. Same with certain detail throughout the day.
2	Not sure if am in estp but I have had good reason to suspect so. I've experienced the exact same things I have tho. If that counts for something 
2	I have an amazing memory. I remember the entire layout of the house I lived in when I was 2-3 years old, I remember specific moments like when my grandparents (whom I lived with) brought me outside to show me a rainbow. I remember the exact spot on the gravel road leading to the house where my grandma and I pulled over to look at a tarantula in the road. I remember the smell of the pot my grandpa used to smoke and where he would sit as he smoked it. I remember infinitely more than this, but I'd say, no. I definitely don't have a bad memory lol. I may not count anymore though because I'm getting slightly different personality test results after the last four years of school.
2	Seems more like an attention problem than memory issue actually.
2	[deleted]
2	My hubby is an ESTP. He appears to have a terrible memory, but it's not really his memory that's the problem although he does have a tendency to forget a lot. For him, it seems to be more a tunnel vision type of thing where he gets distracted easily. He'll be putting dishes away, then gets sidetracked and never finishes what he started. It's very frustrating for me since I'm always cleaning up after him, lol.\n\nBut he has a great memory, when he focuses on something. It seems his mind is limited in *what* and *how much* he can hold. The more he's forced to remember the more he forgets and acts scatter brained. Or what he thinks is important. I'll ask him to do something, he'll agree, then forgets and thinks the conversation where he agreed never happened. Even if it was an hour prior. He won't believe it unless it's proved via video or written, which has proven to him this is a problem of his. He just makes lists, then doesn't read them, lol.
2	Yeah I do that if I'm not interested or don't care for the person. I'm bad with names but I'll remember plenty about the person and faces for sure. I can go over everything I know about someone but wouldn't remember their name for shit if it's been too long\n\n\nI can only ever study up to 36 hours before something, but it sticks like white on rice\n\n\nWhen it comes to remembering an experience I'm usually on point, but moreso I remember them in more Se ways like how it felt physically, how I felt physically, vivid static images or gifs of memory essentially, perhaps a key sound, etc
1	For some types it takes more effort to access what your brain knows or what you've seen. Memory is an ESTP's strongest "weakness". In times of real need, it may not be so troublesome for you to remember what you need. But you'll usually tend to be reluctant to stop what your doing and access memory because it's inefficient and takes too much effort to dig into the archives - other functions get the job done too and those are your strengths that don't take much effort.
1	Se-Ti loop at play, sometimes it gets me when I'm looking for something I've misplaced. 
1	I think its normal to stop listening to someone if they are long winded and you can already figure out the consclusion. *Yawns* I find that I have better memory when I'm doing something tactile while listening (writing, chewing gum, twirling hair).\n\nI dont think its a memory thing since you never placed their words into memory in the first place, which is why you (and probably other estp's) have a hard time recalling specifics from conversations. Our love of gainig knowledge allows us take tests without much stress.
1	Cognitive functions of our type.
1	My gf is a ESTP and I think she has a horrible memory. She can rember things about her chialdhood like she went camping every summer but she cant really elaborate on what she did while camping.\n It is very frustrating trying to have a conversation with someone who cant rember anything.
1	Mine is awful. I never remember if I've told someone something or not, and I feel like my memories are locked away in a weird safe in my brain that I have to actually try to access. It's really frustrating. 
1	I learn by doing  if I try to memorise something someone said to me I have zero chance at all. If I'm able to learn something first hand by doing it I'm a million times more successful.\n\nI will pretty much forget people's name as soon as they tell me. It really is in one ear and out the other. 
7	Hey does this sound like an ESTP to you guys? Flexible and tolerant, they take a pragmatic approach focused on immediate results. Theories and conceptual bore them. They want to act energetically to solve the problem. Focus on the here and now Spontaneous and enjoy every moment they spend with other	They also enjoy material comforts and style. Learn best through doing.
4	sounds pretty spot on to me. 
1	I want to be an ESTP becuz I admire a certain character and wish to be a lot like him. I'm not sure if I am an estp tho. I've taken many tests and a lot of them say enfp ESFP and estp sometimes other answer but rarely. Little help here?	
5	Not from me man. Just be who you are. Don't get so hung up on these titles. Plus people change a couple times in their life. You might have already been an estp or will be in the future
3	Te is short for extroverted thinking and Ti is short for Introverted thinking. Better yet, do you find yourself somewhat ambiverted? Most ESTPs would agree they aren't fully extroverted or Introverted but rather  in the middle. 
3	why do you want to be an ESTP? We can trade! It ain’t all daisies and rainbows over here, I can tell you that. Genuine, deep, authentic, reciprocal feelings (or feelings in general) are so hard it’s downright painful. I would do ANYTHING else than to sit around and “feel” things, especially difficult emotions like sadness. Anger is the only acceptable emotion. Anger becomes sadness, hurt, disappointment, a catch all. Hardened exterior as a result. Outside is fun, strong and impenetrable, devil may care attitude, but inside, a loneliness that no one would ever guess is there. 
2	I would say just be happy with who you are as a person. But if you are really want to know type correlates with you, I would research the functions of each type and see if any of them match up with you. I would also take various personality tests and keep track of the results, and see if there are ones that repeat. And if you still feel that you need to find your type, I would just pay for the official test from the Myers-Briggs Foundation.
1	There are definitely people out there that will cherish you for the mindset you naturally bring with you, don't try to be someone else. But you might have to force yourself to try new things to find them
1	From your posts I'd say you're more likely an EXFP.
1	Oh ok. Results of each test? If your getting flagged as ENFP or ESFP then your probably more likely to be user of Te and not Ti. 
5	How did your SO catch your attention?	*Figures*
5	On tinder his opening line was: \n\n"We have a lot to talk about..."\n\nHe sparked my curiousity.\n\n
3	She was (and is) beautiful, and I felt something when we made eye contact. From there, she was very optimistic and interested in me. She didn't reveal much about herself at first, and continued to ask me question after question, until i started to pick up on her tendencies. Once i had her pegged, i knew which questions she did and didn't want to answer. I enjoyed watching her give in to heart over her mind, when she would answer the questions she felt like she shouldn't. and dat ass tho.
3	He had a six pack
2	Boobs
2	Dat ass 
1	They looked hot on Tinder
1	Hot on tinder 
1	This ISFP who is married to an ESTP (10+ years) said she caught his eye by not being easy to get, when he could get any girl, and by basically allowing him to have his freedom, not being clingy, controlling, or possessive but letting him go about his things while having a life of her own, and by being always able to come up with a comeback. But then [ISFPs are supervisors of ESTPs](http://personalitycafe.com/estp-articles/289-love-types-estp-5.html#post10023554), so it's very common that ESTP men put ISFP women on a pedestal and end up chasing after them.
3	I don't know if I'm an ESTP or not. The reason for this is becuz like a lot of people I've taken a lot of personality tests and they come out differently. I think I'm pretty extroverted. Im half and half on t vs f. I'm observant I think. Perciveing =yes. Don't know if I'm blunt. Sometimes sensitive	
2	Every person is sensitive about certain subjects. You try a cognitive function test?
1	Sorry, was busy. What did you get?
1	Then that confirms it. 
1	Only way to test the validity of the test is to take it and compare a cognitive functions test. So yeah, fairly certain. Sensitive would come from either your Fe or Ni function.
3	ENTJ w/ question	Hi I'm a relatively young ENTJ male (20) and started dating this girl who I think is an ESTP and am looking for some opinions and advice. She loves to be active and always out of the house doing things, is fiercely logical, and is up for everything and loves to drive fast. For our next date she's going to take me drifting in her extremely fast car, and I plan on making her dinner afterwards. I don't know her type for certain, but I she's ESTP. Does this describe you?\n\nAnyways, do y'all have any general advice on how to proceed? Things I should do and things I should definitely not do? I'm not looking for y'all to make my relationship perfect, but some personal advice would be wonderful.
3	Dinner you say? Take her to an all you can eat Brazilian BBQ place. Try not to plan too much. No further recommendations.\n\nTake it easy! Relationships are supposed to be fun ;)
3	Best of luck. ESTPs and ENTJs don't work well together because ESTPs are freedom loving, where as ENTJs sometimes feel the need to control their environment. 
2	I'm also a young female ESTP. Don't overwhelm her with feelings or sweet talk, just be fun and witty/charming. Keep her on her toes ! If she's already taking control of the date with dinner and he racing, just see how you enjoy her craziness! Determine if you can keep up. 
1	She totally sounds like an ESTP. I'm the same way. I'm never at my apartment (my roommates probably think I hate them), I speed all the time, and I'm fairly active.\n\n I think you guys should do something fun pre-drifting like rock-climbing, going for a swim, or anything that's also fun that you have easy access to. To me, having dinner after drifting sounds like leaving the party early. I have a hard time thinking she wouldn't like to do something else in addition to having dinner. \n\nAlso, I second taking her to a Brazillian BBQ place. They usually have different cuts and kinds of meat, which will definitely spice up the dinner portion of the date. \n
1	Kayaking and surprise picnic lunch after 
1	ESTP and ENTJ is a great match! Don't worry about it too much... 
2	how can an ESTP develop Ti ?	
5	categorize everything 
5	Be like Donald Trump XD and keep repeating same simplified 'truths' ad infinitum until others believe you and go with what you say.
2	develop concise and effective explanations aimed at average people.  good tutoring is like the ultimate creative Ti endeavor 
1	Helping people in a way that's natural and stress-free for you
5	How important is your family for you?	ISFJ here and I am curious about how important your family is for you?
7	Extremely? That is, if they don't screw me over in some way.  IMO, I'm fiercely loyal until you screw me over, then I have no problems cutting you out of my life and never speaking to you again. 
3	My loyalty is in my family above anything else. I'll flake on my closest friends if I have a family commitment and I don't care how that impacts people around me. If I fight with my family, I'll have forgotten it hours later, regardless of how big the fight is, so I never stay mad at them. \nAlso, I don't know how much of that is my family centered Hispanic culture or my personality type. 
2	They're the only people I actually like/trust most of the time. Even when they piss me off its like "Well shit I'm stuck with these assholes forever so I might as well deal with it."\n\nThat being said, they never usually piss me off. For some reason they listen to and do almost whatever I say. Probably because I'm like really smart and know a lot of common sense shit that other people don't.

2	People say I'm good at everything I try to do	Anyone else get this?
4	I haven't tried many new things recently, but about a half a year ago I gave learning manual transmission a go and got it pretty much down in 10-15 minutes of trying. I'd say we're pretty hands-on people so just give us some time to learn about something ourselves and we'll try to master it.
3	lol I'll always remember my friends reaction when he taught me to juggle in about 10 minutes while he said it took him days. yeah I can give most things a pretty good go.
2	Is it harder to have desk jobs?	I've read that it's harder, but has anyone had experience? I recently got a job as a receptionist and it's not exactly bad, but I constantly think of everything else I could be doing instead.
5	I hate my desk job and leave the desk as often as possible 
3	Yeah desk jobs suck the life out of you. Try to find something to do to keep yourself occupied 
3	For me, its not a desk job issue, but more of a 'is this work redundant or routine', which we can all agree that would be hell.\n\nI have a desk job and absolutely love it. Working with the public in a non profit really does spice up life. I never know what types of dire situations people will come in with and I have to get creative to help them. It keeps me on my toes. Plus I have a standing desk so I can move, sway, and fidget as much as needed without bothering others.
2	I think it's fucking hard, but luckily my job is about 50% away from the desk and is pretty damn exciting. Don't know how many fun desk jobs are out there, but mine is! I'm a server at night as well which I LOVE. 
2	I live my life one airport laptop charge at a time.\n\nSeriously though. I work from home. I have multiple things happening at once. TV, generating a PPT, taking breaks for myself,etc. You can do it. 
2	yep. trying to figure out what my next job is going to be...need to pay the bills but want nothing near an office.
1	Holy shit yes
4	Are ESTPs prone to be sociopaths?	I've always been ESTP and relate to many things said here, but I've always been willing to do what it takes to succeed or climb the ladder, and I notice I don't have much guilt about most things, although some things I have done cause guilt. The only feelings I really get is jealousy and anger, the happiest I've been is when I left church camp and it didn't last long. I read about sociopaths and I have a few similar traits to the definition. My question is, does anyone else here relate to what is considered a sociopath? Do any of you have a hard time with feeling emotions or lack of guilt? 
10	Guilt is a useless emotion honestly. I'd rather make amends or leave the situation be (because what's done is done). Reflecting and slowing down is not a strong point of estps; it needs to be developed to be harmonious with others. Our sharp tounge hurts feelers and life is easier if feelers arent rowled up.
7	Always making an effort to grow and understand feeling. 
5	Anyone is prone to be a sociopath
3	Sociopaths have a very distinct vibe to them. True sociopaths are rare in the population and there are many more people of type ESTP than that, so while a few ESTPs might be on the spectrum the majority of ESTPs are not sociopathic. ESTP's feeling functions Fe/Fi are located in a vulnerable lacking zone for the type so ESTPs definitely have complexes in this area but this takes a variety of forms depending on person's identity and experiences and doesn't have to amount to sociopathy. It doesn't seem to be limited to type either, as I have met a female INFJ and a male ENTJ who were definitely on this spectrum.     \n     \nThe definition of sociopathy is someone whose mind thinks almost 100% rationally and logically and does not or barely engages the emotional parts of the brain. Since emotions are an important part of any personal relationships, the sociopath tends to stick out like a sore thumb - his or her logical mind attempts to make up for the lack of emotional processing that they are incapable of but never quite makes it there. Typical superficial traits that sociopaths exhibit are 1) "proto-emotions" which are simplistic and simplified emotional reactions to what is happening around them, 2) boredom and listless activity, which can be constructive like being a workaholic, 3) certain inability to relate to others and to fully integrate themselves into society, as there is always something off about these people, 4) overrunning other people's boundaries, since boundaries are often communicated on an emotional level that sociopaths don't comprehend 5) vindictiveness, since the sociopath cannot comprehend why people act a certain way and cannot sympathize with them, which leads him to conclude that they meant him harm and he should vindicate it. Some sociopaths will share their secret that they feel that "there is something is wrong with them" though next to none make it to the full realization.     \n     \nThings like wanting to always win, to be one step ahead of others, or wanting to engage in criminal, destructive, and even deadly behaviors aren't the same thing as sociopathy. Some of these traits have other origins, like having an Antisocial Personality Disorder or inheriting certain genes that emphasize aggression, and being a sociopath only makes it easier to engage in these behaviors while not being intrinsically linked to them.
3	I don't know the difference between sociopath and psycopath, but yeah I do relate to some traits, but I'm sure I'm not lucky enough to be one (it's a joke guys).

2	I feel very similar.
11	Does anyone else not not enjoy movies as much as everyone else? I get antsy unless it's a great show/movie.	Also, what are your favorites? My personal favorite is Parks and Recreation. That show utilizes a lot of body language and insinuations in it's humor and I just love it.
9	If I'm watching a movie at the cinema then I have no problem paying attention. If it's at home on Netflix or something then I'll be switching tabs every 2 minutes.
4	I'm very, very picky when it comes to films, and I find that most these days really don't hold my attention. The only films I enjoy are well done epics or action/adventure feel good flicks (my go-to film is The Mummy). 
2	[deleted]
2	Yeah my attention span has plummeted a long way. I can't get through the first 30 seconds of most movies, and if a TV show starts slowly, I'll just get bored.
1	I like pretty much every movie lol
2	Chris Pratt ESTP debate: the first 30 seconds of this video kinda settle it.	
2	He is without a doubt ESFP. \n\nVery in tune with the world around him and has that peculiar sort of sensitivity that most fi/te users show 
1	ESFP
4	Your college/career/life story or plans	Just want to get this place a bit more active. I don’t know about you but I love hearing from others for life advice and life stories. Especially over reddit because you people are quite interesting!\n\nI’m a college student aiming for an degree in information systems (basically IT). I went to a four-year initially and hated my experience so I left. Hope to get a position as a business or systems analyst after undergrad or a sys admin. Not really sure why, I just wanna get into management for an IT team and that’s pretty hard straight out of undergrad even for a BBA/B.Com/Econ major from what I’ve heard. So hopefully one of these careers will get me to where I wanna be in the future.\n\nMy whole life I’ve been sort of aimless, not really putting effort into anything but getting places, slowly but surely. I’ve had a passion for cars and astronomy but I don’t really have the means to get serious about them. Nor do I have a strong drive. Probably more of the latter. I haven’t started dating but I’m pretty optimistic about starting in the near future. I’d love to adopt a dog once I make good money as well. Not sure about children quite yet. I’m just not sure if I’m responsible enough.\n\nShare away! Hope you all are doing well.\n\nEdit- adding stuff
5	I joined the army as infantry and I study kinesiology now to be a coach and teacher 
4	I got a 3.78 in High School and scored a 30 on my ACT, so I thought college was going to be great. But after four years of attendance, and after trying Applied Math and Physics, BioChemistry, Psychology, and Business, I had a 2.4 GPA simply because I couldn't keep trying and had no passion for anything I had studied. I just dropped out of school this May, as finishing my degree would take another 1.5-2 years of school and I don't have the motivation to do it anymore, and honestly I have no idea what the hell I want to do.\n\nOr well, rather I'm torn between two things. I am smart, and I know that. But I am also extremely good with people and flourished in college. This sounds conceited but I think my fellow ESTP's will understand when I say that the only thing that gave me a sense of meaning in college was my popularity. Not necessarily because I want recognition (which I do to be honest), but because I simply love making others smile and enjoy their day to day lives, and I felt like I truly made people feel valued. I love computers and gaming, etc. so I have been considering a career in the tech field, but if I'm honest, I really WANT to be an actor, because making people smile is what gives me satisfaction.\n\nSo there you have it. I'm trying to decide whether to settle for a secure, good paying job in the tech field, or take the risk (which we ESTP's are all about) and try to become an actor.\n\nAlso, fun fact since I'm talking about acting: I'm from Springfield, MO (where Brad Pitt is from), and I actually know Brad's family.
3	working on becoming an event dj
2	I have been pretty aimless myself. I have always felt that I often go with the flow.\n\nMy school life I was an average kid with really no particular aim. I wanted to be an engineer because I liked automobiles. While I did engineering, it was not even remotely close to anything related to automobiles. \n\nDuring the last year of my high school I was good at coding so I thought I would do engineering in computer science. When I got the option, I instead went for communications engineering. 2 years in I was still average at engineering and already bored of my stream. \n\nAt the beginning of fourth year of engineering, different companies come to recruit freshers for their company. By that time I still hadn't thought what I wanted to do. \n\nThen one day this big powerful multinational company came (one of the big four) and I suddenly thought that I should try for it and I got through. So yea, esstentially going with the flow. I have no idea what I will be doing in 2 years down the line honestly.\n\nThe only plan that I really have is now that I would like to retire early and party and travel like fucking dan bilzerian. \n\n\n\nAnd about personal interests - I haven't had a gf yet because I was extremely shy and had social anxiety in my school life. While I am not as shy and socially anxious anymore (partly because I was able to discover my personality), I just havent found the woman who I want to really get on with and has shown interest in me. \n\nAlso, only plan that I am really sure about is that I am getting a German shepherd for me when I can. :)\n
6	What qualities turn off ESTPs?	I'm an ISFJ dating an ESTP. I feel like I bore him wanting to talk about hypotheticals with our future, and irritate him when I downplay my actual emotions so I don't seem like I'm overreacting. What else grinds ESTPs' gears?
17	Don't talk about the future too much. We think in the now. And try not to hide your feelings. Honest communication is key with us ESTPs. Also acting immature, not being a good listener, and being overly dramatic don't exactly float my boat. 
3	Don't be boring. The communication bit is good. I like it. Oh, and I know I really like coming up with ideas and executing them. \n\nSo... yeah, talk and do stuff that makes us think and act. 
3	oh god. you had me at isfj.\n\ntoo needy. pass.
2	I recommend not always wanting to do the same thing, making sure you are direct with how you feel, and doing spontaneous little things like going for a drive after dark to get ice cream or something. And compliment him, we ESTP's like compliments 👌🏽
2	You're allowed be mean and overdramatic, they can take a lot. But for hypotheticals you're better of talking to a Ne person.
2	1. Don't be dumb\n2. Say it like it is.\n3. We love talking and we hope you like listening.\n4. Don't be so emotional although we do love helping people and caring about pretty much everyone.
2	Don't be a pussy
1	The same ones that Leo's and Gemini's hate. 
5	MBTI is god's crutch for inferior Ni's	Our inferior function is Ni, which means we are terrible at using abstract between-the-lines information to make connections in order to derive a framework of how things work or the way things are (causing us to be prone to overextending Se and ultimately falling into Ni grip). Because of this I think MBTI is actually ESPECIALLY useful for us and ESFP's because it provides just that, a comprehensive and insightful framework (about people) from which we can constantly reference to guide our behavior and construct our worldview.\n\nIronically, based on the presence of our online community, it seems like we're the ones least interested in MBTI. Ah well. \n\n~* flies back to r/entp *~
5	This is just an anecdote, and I'm not sure you explained Ni properly, but my brother is ESTP and I always sort him out when we meet about where he is in life and where he is going. He's not stupid or thoughtless at all, but he definitely lacks a coherent framework for his life.
3	I have to agree with you here, I am an estp and ever since I found out about the mbti I have used it to my advantage to figure people out and what motivates them. Knowing that and a little of their background has help me to know whether they are worth my time or not.
1	[deleted]
1	I'd say ESFPs are lease likely to engage type theory or social media for the most part. But yeah, my Ni is only functional under stress and when I'm depressed about something. 
2	Hello, Motherfuckers! I am here for your data!	I'm researching how the different MBTI types like to be asked out/approached romantically for an article, and would like (semi) serious answers. So, if someone was interested in you, whether it be a friend or a stranger in a bar, how would you appreciate someone asking you out in a romantic fashion?\n\nThank you!\n
4	haha Fi PoLR 
2	Hello interesting ENTP... Approach ESTPs exactly like how you would want to be approached: straight-forward, fun, and natural. 
2	These articles will give you a general outline of how romantic behavior varies by type (they flip j/p for introverts, so their INFp is MBTI INFJ, while extraverts stay same): [Erotic Attitudes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/101-Erotic-Attitudes) & [Romantic and Sexual Behavior of Quadras and Subtypes](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/441-Romantic-Sexual-Behavior-of-Quadras-and-Subtypes).
1	In a straightforward and light-hearted fashion. \n\n
1	Just be natural about it man idk. Hey we should hang out some time lemme get ur number. We can't teach you how to have social skills over the internet.
1	Like just take it easy, keep it light and flirtatious. And then literally just ask me out. 'Is it okay if I ask for your number/take you out sometime?'
1	Well I'm a guy so.. I'm usually the one making the move. But I try to follow how I prefer people would make plans with me. Casual, fun, and light.
1	Fun ESTP fictional character?	Whenever I see you people described you come off as; "Fun, but smart" even the little tidbit on here reads; ESTPs are outgoing, straight-shooting types. Enthusiastic and excitable, they are "doers" who live in the world of action. Blunt, straight-forward risk-takers, they are willing to plunge right into things and get their hands dirty.\n\nHere's the thing for the life of me I don't know many ESTP characters that embody the "fun" trait. In fact most fun/outgoing characters I've seen tend to either be ESFP, or ENTP.\n\nI'd really like to see an ESTP character that embodies the full concept, a character who actually seems like a fun, life of the party sort, who also happens to be intelligent, competitive etc. \n\nFigured I'd ask here first, since this is the ESTP place.
6	Tyler Durden, idk if it'd fit fun though
2	Sterling Archer
3	Jessica Jones, seems like a pretty fun life to me\n\nThat's a good point tho, can't think of any ESTP party type characters. They all seem pretty serious.
2	Uh, Barney Stinson, Jake from Brooklyn 99. What else you need? And no Barney is not ENTP if you try to say that I will literally kill your offspring.
0	Fuck it	So I got myself a nice thai massage the other day, nothing sexual, just a regular thing. Anyways this nice asian chick pulled me in and started working my body. I told her I wanted something relaxing but that's really not what I got. She foiled me like a piece of paper and worked every muscles with great "energy" and dexterity.\n\nWhile she was busy I started thinking, "wait this is a little too rough, I should tell her to ease up a little." But really I did not say anything but, "no it's really good, go on".\n\nIt wasn't my first massage, I've had all sorts before but this one was different. I didn't space out, I couldn't really think, all I could do was attentively follow her hands on my body. \n\nSmall & slim with a warm smile and a very soft skin... But also strong, commanding and present. Obvious estp but I only realized it once I heard the lyrics of a song playing in my head. "You can be boss daddy, you can be the boss. I like you a lot. Don't let it stop."\n\nI wasn't turned on per se but let's be honest that was incredibly erotic. I was completely okay with whatever she'd choose to do to me. And she did, she took control and I let her drive. I didn't think I was capable of welcoming pain in such way. It's always been the other way around but as of now, all I can think of is how much I want her to hurt me. \n\nIt keeps looping in my mind with same typical shit that goes with this kind of encounter. Here's the paradox, I don't want to start imagining all of *that*. What I really want now is for her or someone like her to shut down all that overthinking. \n\nIt makes me realize how trivial all of this is. Why even go through this endless Ni hell when I could simply give her what she wants, control.
1	Friendo you sound like you're discovering sub tendencies, if I'm interpreting your "overthinking" correctly.\n\nTwo things to do. One, dip your toes into being sexually submissive. Not to this woman, obvs she's a professional and was just working your tension out as any masseuse would. Esp if she's Asian, she will prioritize where your body needs relaxation rather than your verbal commands to stop (source: mom is a masseuse, unless you scream and cry she won't stop if she can tell your back is messed up. LMFAO) Find a bdsm community.  I suggest this because a well-established bdsm community is the safest space for a flowering sub to be taught things without getting hurt by inexperienced doms.  If you're familiar with this, and you're a dom, welcome to the world of being a switch.\n\nTwo, if that thought scares you or makes you feel emasculated, maybe use that Ni to dig deeper on why?? 
2	What's with the need to act tough all the time?	
18	It's an effective way to hide crippling depression. 
13	Weakness is not fun or funny or useful. Toughness is useful and exciting. 
9	Not being weak/sensitive/emotional =/= acting tough
3	Why do INFxs cry all the time? We'll never know.
1	Define "acting tough" 
1	Don't act it, be it. Overcome adversity in life. 
3	Are dead bodies sacred?	A lot of people will agree that humans should have complete control over their own bodies while they are alive. How about after death? Is it better to use those bodies (for organ donation etc.) for the benefit of the living?\n\nShould there be an opt-out instead of opt-in for organ donation? How about in tricky situations where the person died really early before deciding?
2	I think yes, and if the dead person/family didn't decide anything, then we should just take their organs for sick people.
1	If they're wished to be kept so by themselves or family, sure. Otherwise, no. If the greater good of medical science could use the body for experimentation, it should be used instead of saved
1	No
7	ESTP type in depth description by Stratiyevskaya (Socionics SLE "Zhukov")	
2	Can we get the TL;DR version perhaps? A lot of info with words trying to make it sounds too fancy.
2	You should have posted this one on /r/entj instead. \n\nThat'd be a great troll actually. Switch all denominations, cut a few key parts before presenting them and then just wait for the denial train...
0	ESTPs suck	***TRIGGERED***
15	What an absolute savage
12	Damn dude you really fooled us
6	But we suck good!
1	Would you care to explain yourself further?
1	mhm
1	I laughed even before clicking on the post
1	True
1	If you REALLY want to see what suck, do an test, but instead of doing what you are, you select what suck.
1	I suck your awesome if that's what you mean your welcome 😉 HAHA jokes seriously but why did something happen between you and an ESTP? I'm all ears.
5	Getting cold feet about dating	Need some perspective here. 24 year old male working in the technology sector. Making good money. Enjoying the bachelor life hanging out with friends and doing whatever I want with whoever I want. I am enjoying it. I didn't plan on settling down until 26-28 because I want to put in a ton of time at work so that I am established as possible when it is time to settle down.\n\nA girl comes out of left field a couple weeks ago. 20 year old girl who is a dental assistant. I know this sounds dumb, but do you guys ever get cold feet when you think about settling down, even if it's just dating? Does it ever go away when you get older or should I just take up this opportunity to dive in the deep end?
2	25 female in tech, in a relationship and have no intention to marry any time soon. you meet someone amazing, you don't deny that opportunity. go for it and see how it goes
1	24 year old male working in tech here. I have no intention of dating anytime soon. Keeping it casual.
1	I've been in 2 different serious relationships over the last 5 years. I've never really had an interest in settling down, but have been able to rationalize getting into relationships using one bit of rationale (both to myself and my girlfriend(s))\n\n"what is a couple of years over a lifetime?"\n\nit allows them to feel more comfortable with your long term plans, and is also a great way at preventing an engagement ring or some other dumb shit. Also, it's a general principle that i believe in. If the love/intimacy is there, and you are both confident in it, why would you need to rush things. 
5	Are INFJ abilities actually useful to you?	Hi, I was wondering if you found INFJs as significantly helpful to you in an everyday kind of way. We are supposed to be really good at reading people (I'm an INFJ), and I don't know if that is of very practical use to an ESTP in a friendship, business partnership, or relationship. \n\nI can analyze poetry. I really don't think that matters at all to an ESTP, while it might be their weakness--Not to say that there are no great poets of our time here on the ESTP thread. \n\nIt seems that some ESTPs are attracted to INFJs. I don't know if that is a thing, or if that is something I have only seen a few times. Maybe the girls were just cute and their type didn't matter actually. \n\nSo in you opinion, do you consider the INFJ' ability to read people significantly valuable at work, at home, or as friends? \n\nThanks!!!!!!!!!
11	ESTP are also really good at reading people, that's what makes us socially proficient
5	Kindness and goodwill, plus their ability to rad people makes them very useful to me. But a liability if they become too naive.
1	Yes analyze me\n\nMy ego loves it\n\nYou're wrong\n\nBut still\n\n^^I ^^secretly ^^believe ^^in ^^astrology
2	INFJs: friend or greatest enemy?	Hi, I was wondering what you like or dislike about INFJs. Have you had significant problems with them? Do you trust or distrust them? Overall, what is your impression? \n\nAre they like a threat or too personal too fast? If you got to know one more personally, what did you find? Did you get angry with them or did you find a real friend? \n\nI just don't know what the reality is for the ESTP-INFJ combination. It probably depends on the individuals, but I keep reading that it is supposed to be either the greatest or the absolute worst, and I don't know what to believe, so I came here to ask you guys about it. \n\nThey say that one's greatest strengths are the other's greatest weaknesses. Assuming that that is true, would you consider the INFJ's strengths as a major benefit to you? What do you offer the INFJ in return?\n\nI've met two ESTPs, but I kept them at a distance and never got to know them and now I kind of regret it because it might have been interesting. I was too afraid I guess. But I am curious. Thanks. 
4	My childhood friend is an INFJ. We get along beautifully for the most part, but maybe that's just a byproduct of having known each other for so long. \n\nThere are certain parts of her personality that annoy me - for instance, she doesn't know when to give up on toxic people. It's funny though; she on the other hand accuses me of giving up too quickly. In my defense, I am more utilitarian with my efforts and know when to cut my losses. I don't try to "fix" people. If someone isn't contributing to my life in a positive way, and is also a pain in the ass to deal with - then why should I keep them around? \n\nWhich brings me to my next point about trying to change others; I've noticed that she has a tendency to do that. I know I myself am far from perfect, and what is best for me may not necessarily or objectively be good for someone else. \n\nHowever, my weaknesses are her strengths. She can read people on a much deeper level than I can; it's hard for me to describe. She's also much more careful and meticulous than I am, lol. I'm all about jumping right in to get the task over with, but for her, everything must be done with painstaking perfection. Hope this helps!  
3	INFJ's are good people, my grandmother is an a INFJ. They can be idealistic in my opinion and usually are not fit for public office (ex: 39th US President Jimmy Carter, he was very naive and easily manipulated) due to the fact that they are too kind and try to "change" people or change systems that really have no way of changing. But what I do like them is that they bring kindness and that they are genuinely good and (mostly) incorruptible people who stand by their morals no matter the circumstances. \n\nI see INFJ's strentghs very useful, kind and nicely organized. God bless you all and please keep bringing kindness in this cruel world.
2	Best friend of all time is an INFJ. From what I understand, most of my friend's best friend's have the opposite of their type too. 
1	It honestly depends. I am an INFJ and was bullied heavily by mostly ESTPs in school. However, that was also because I was an ethnic minority so it made me an "easier" target. My brother is an ESTP and we get along really well.
4	Would anyone be interested in creating some custom content for different personality types?	Hey everyone, \nI'm planning on starting a Medium publication, around some custom content for various personality types. Content that might relate to just a specific personality type (e.g. INTPs, ESTPs) in a blog type format. \n\nI have ideas, if interested! :)
1	Like what, for example 
5	How would you best explain and describe your type (ESTP) to a person who knows nothing about Myers-Briggs?	No need to be technical.  I just want to know how you perceive yourselves and others specific to this type.  What do you notice that resonates with the ESTP personality type? Instead of “traits or characteristics” that are so often used within the Myers-Briggs terminology, I would like to hear examples, stories, and/or perspectives you can offer.  I plan on posting this question in each Myers-Briggs specific subreddit to help foster understanding and create insight through first person experiences and perceptions. 
15	Highly logical, extremely satisfying to prove people wrong, jack-of-all trades, hates to study (rather do something interesting), WILL die doing something that keeps adrenaline pumping. 
7	An ESTP is the salesman/executive who is extremely charismatic lives his life fast and can convince you to do a lot of things. As an ESTP I have a great sense of humor and I love a good debate, but warning they do not care about feelings FACTS only. \n\nVery Pragmatic, if you want decisive action and quickly an ESTP is the person that you should ask,
6	What was engaging/interesting for you in HS English?	I'm an English teacher in high school, and I wanted to know what to add to my lessons to make them engaging/interesting/fun for ESTPs and SPs in general. I think I want to add it as an activity at the beginning of the lesson as a warmup or maybe in the form of questions or activities throughout my lessons. \n\nI would really appreciate it if you could let me know what questions really get your minds going and getting creative. \n\nI was thinking that maybe I could start my lessons with an individual written activity or group work with a real-life scenario/dilemma and asking students to defend their position with a reason or explanation. \n\nWhat do you think? I've had students who say that we never do Anything, and I just don't get it. We are not in PE? What can I do to get everyone involved? \n\nI can get students to stand up and discuss with other students whom they normally don't talk to to collaborate with them, to interview each other, and to ask them questions to get different perspectives. Then, we can switch partners up to three times to get variety. \n\nWhat do you think? Please let me know what your teachers did in academic classes like history, math and science, and especially in English to get your attention and input. \n\nThank you X1000!!!!
8	I hated English lit, but am good at English, a definite crossroads. The worst part of it was literary analysis for me. I hated sitting there cross examining every little detail of something, trying to find meaning in stuff that may have been written exactly literally and that's it. Face value, nothing more.\n\nWe spent an entire class period analyzing one poem, and at the end I asked "What if the author just likes sunsets, so he wrote about it?"\n\nGot suspended for that 
4	[deleted]
3	Fantastic question.\n\nI'm an ESTP, when I was in High School and had to do language. My teacher found out that presenting and debating was one of my best expertise, also time assignments. \n\nShe used to do this thing when we had to do an assignment in 10 minutes or less. I found myself thriving in that environment because it was fast. You can easily engage me if there is something to persuade people with and if I need to do it fast.
2	Just be an interesting teacher. One of my favorite classes of all time was my English class and my ENTP English teacher was my favorite teacher ever. I was at least engaged enough to listen
2	To be honest I never read. If I felt like it I’d read summaries of the assigned chapters in case we would be assessed on it in class. Winged all but one of them with an A by just putting in a shred of effort here and there. That other class was an accelerated class that I just got through by talking to people I knew and paying attention here and there. Although it certainly helped that the teacher didn’t give a damn about how we behaved since she was leaving the next year. I could’ve put a bit more work into the class but I was dealing with a heavy workload from another class I was taking and took a pass on most extra credit opportunities.\n\nAs for discussion time, I was *sort of* involved. I’m just not very good in developing my thoughts in a flowing manner so I often felt reluctant to share in discussions for fear of being judged by others for what I said.\n\nBut to directly answer your question, the fun little presentations and mini-projects was what really made me feel engaged in the class.\n\nedit- formatting and clarification
3	What do INFPs think of ESTPs?	I'm an INFP-T and I have an anomalistic, irrational, painful obession with all ESTPs. (Nevermind-- scratch the 'all'. I mean every ESTP besides the legendary Donald Trump.) They draw me in like watching period dramas on Netflix whilst eating Doritos and drinking StarBucks frappes…… which, to both my sadness and pleasure, is the only thing that draws me in that I can access without my face turning into a red-tomato while I fall face-first on the cold floor out of mortification.\n\nAnyways, I am truly in your beautiful debt if you read the whole entire paragraph (which truly should have been plural) without closing your computer and throwing it off into the Grand Canyon.\n\nNow that you've read my flowery language, I would like to know what ESTPs think of INFPs… now that you've heard what I, an INFP, thinks of ESTPs.\n\n(The title is actually wrong^. Just goes to show how lazy I am.)
4	I think you should probably ask this over in the INFP subreddit, but as far as I know, IxFx types seem drawn to me.\n\nEdit: LOL, you're not the only lazy one here, I just scanned the post and missed the last part. INFPs are interesting. They can come across in many different ways. Some of them are chill AF, but I've also met angry INFPs, and neurotic ones. The neurotic ones are the ones who annoy me a bit because they seem to be the most openly idealistic (& whiny & sensitive.) The angry one I know is interesting because it's totally fucking obvious to me that she's an INFP, but she gives off this tough/angry/critical exterior (I actually think she's in the grip of her inferior function a lot but whatever.) As for the well-adjusted INFP I know, chill as fuck, quiet, friendly.\n\nOverall I like INFPs.\n\nP.S. the Grand Canyon is too far away, I'd probably just throw it into a river or smash it with a hammer or something.\n\nP.P.S. don't worry too much about the blushing, we'll probably just think it's cute or amusing. Also, if you fall over and stop breathing it just gives us an excuse to jump into action and give you CPR... uuuhh, I mean.....
4	I **could** be an ESTP, but I could also be an ESFP (still working out the kinks). Whatever, they share a lot of similarities anyway. \n\n\nAs for what I think of INFPs (if my opinion even interests you), they are one of my favorites, if not my single favorite. I find their clumsiness and awkwardness adorable. They seem to be one of the only types I can really unwind and relax with. \n\n\nI am quite the thrill seeker, but even I need time to recharge. However, the only thing better than recharging alone is recharging with the company of a calm and gentle introvert who won't tire me out. 
2	I'm gonna try not to be too dickish, but here I go. \n\nIt's ridiculously easy for me to get to know INFPs but I find a bunch of things annoying about them. It's probably that I feel like the ones in my experience try to project an image of being "the shy but hyperactive people who are also human messes who never sleep also memes" which I don't like at all, since I don't really get how someone could project as that while leading with Fi. I like the INFPs who embrace their Fi much more, the ones who are openly moralistic since I appreciate the honesty. *(PRESENT COMPANY EXCLUDED OF COURSE)*
1	My mother is an INFP, she always thinks that I can be pessimistic or that I don't finish works that literally have no chance of success. \n\nBut I like INFP's they bring loyalty and positivity in my life. 
1	😂😂😂\n\nY'all are aight, it depends entirely on the person. Relationships take some work but communication is key as always and it should be fine \n\n\nGood in my book 
1	A guy Friend of mine is an INFP he's sweet, sensitive but pessimistic probably because of that one rejection. I'm not sure if all INFPs are like this but have faith in yourself whether it's love or whatever you're doing don't get so down easily and if only he was straight forward honestly I hate it when he avoids the problem but it's good he's a good person at heart so bravo to that!!
3	How to develop Ni?	
3	Meditation
3	Become a hyper aware paranoid who asks "why" o every single external stimuli from blue sky to that man that sneezed and try to fit it into an internal framework of how the world works. \n\nLol in reality Ni in ESxP types is already developed but is rather subconscious without you knowing you are using it. So idk what your question really is
1	Long solo activities such as driving, surfing, hiking, etc.\n\nWhatever puts you in [the zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_\(psychology\)) yet leaves you calm and alone with your thoughts.\n
1	As an ESTP it initially activates under stress or depression, mine started its development around 25.

6	Time to mass unsub
2	What's the lowest? ESTJ? I went there once and it was like a ghost town.
4	Any ESTP out there that attract depressed/anxious people?	I am an ESTP and I've noticed that the girls who are attracted to me are often depressed and have high anxiety. I've dated girls with anorexia, depression, and bi polar disorder. I have lots of friends who are not depressed but I feel like depressed people are drawn to me and open up to me way faster than I am comfortable with. I just met a depressed INFJ and she told me about her depression and anxiety within 10 minutes of our first conversation. Sorry if this blurb didn't flow very well... ESTP. 
8	I seem to attract men who can't look after themselves
5	That and daddy issues, every single fucking time it's one of those three 
5	im an ESFJ girl and i had depression while i was really into this hot fuckboy ESTP, and it's because y'all thrive on female attention and subconsciously manipulate us/charm us and make us feel special so we want to be around u all the time. you guys are super masculine, popular and funny. you're secretly very protective which makes us feel secure (some of us for the first time in our lives) but aloof enough to make us chase after you, which you hate so you just pull away even more and leave us emotionally devastated. ESTP guys do not make for healthy relationships esp for a dependent girl.
2	Mmm I think you just attracting them yourself bruh lol I can see why they are attracted tho.. we are easy going, know where and how to have fun, and can be positive..
2	Yep, definitely got that problem.
1	I definitely do the same thing, but I have no issues of that sort at all so it's difficult to relate to them
1	There's a girl that's like... obsessed with me cuz she has anxiety and im like her only friend, don't know why she picked me though. Always talks about her anxiety/depression and some of its real but 90% of it is literally her making stuff up for attention 
1	just got out of a relationship with a BPD and INFJ girl.  I thought my positivity would be helpful for her, until shed loose it on me for giving suggestions of help.  I think its because we are very happy people and upbeat.  I want everyone around me to be as awesome as I am.  Life is fun.
1	Maybe girls just suck\n\nNah I think ESTPs are a powerful presence and they see you in a sort of father role. Most girl issues are daddy issues.
1	Its not just dudes coping it. I get anxious depressed and mummy issue type boyfies. I reckon its partly because of the compassionate yet steally charm. What the lass above said about making others feel good yet still having an air of unattainability is the thing that gets those who are a bit more needy or unsure. 
1	Lol yes... how to make it stop? 
1	I attract a lot of ISFJs and female ENTJs, but I bet the later is due to physical features. 
6	Anyone in Love?	What's it like for you? What type are they?
3	They're INFP and they're super clingy and we don't like any of the same things. We make it work though, although it's becoming more of an issue so we're working on middle ground 
5	What are your estp hobbies?	
8	Sports, hanging out with friends and computer stuff
5	Discovering places and meeting new people
4	Off roading, sewing (but rarely with a pattern), photography, hiking/trailrunning.
5	fukkin bichiz and eatin azz\n\nNah I don't have any at the moment but they come and go
2	- Downhill ski racing\n\n- Knocking down New Hampshire's 4000 footers 1 by 1 (hiking)\n\n- Riding my motorcycle around the entire state\n\n- Paintball\n\n- Going to the gym\n\n- Kayaking\n\n- Guitar\n
1	volunteering, travel, Bicycle travel, Rugged travel, Wilderness excursion, cooking a great meal with whatever is in the fridge, sewing, making up parodies, singing, dancing - free style, strategic boardgames.
1	Hanging out with my buds. Nothing I'd rather do.
1	Sorry I'm late, but: sports with friends, hanging with friends in general, video games (almost entirely multiplayer), computer building, guitar, and I LOVE improv acting
1	1. Making fun of socially inept people\n2. Exercise \n3. Friends \n4. Women, which isn't as fun as it used to be for me. 
23	Why is the only mod an INFJ?	INFJ is the enemy
16	Who the fuck cares? As long as he does basic mod shit and does not let power corrupt him you guys should be fine.
8	Idk I guess they feel some kind of deep need to control us. Like no go away
5	I think becuase INFJs are one of the only types that are genuinely interested in Personality Types.
11	The Intuitives control the Sensors.\n\n...\n\n*runs away before being stoned by sensors*
3	Idk man, I actually like INFJs.
3	Why are INFJs the enemy, I don't think I ever met one in real life yet.
1	Because I don't have time or care to sit around controlling other people and sitting at the computer all day. I'm out in the real world. DOING THINGS. No offense to these people - we need them. But I can't see a true ESTP doing that job. Very boring. 
1	[Because I knew how](https://www.reddit.com/r/estp/comments/67ihlt/banning_discord_invites/dhv0g7k/)
6	I feel like I'm gonna die	I'm an ESTP like big time. For some reason my dumbass thought a long time ago that I should be a finance major because it would help me learn to be more frugal and less spontaneous. I'm a junior at this point and I just landed my first internship.\n\nAnd it's fucking awful. These people sit in offices all day and do paperwork and small talk about the dumbest shit. The only person who looks like they're having fun is the branch manager because he gets to leave and go to meetings and stuff. I literally sit in a room from 9-5 copying and pasting stuff from databases and making copies all day. I'm about to fucking explode. \n\nSeeing as most business majors are pretty interchangeable (to an extent) and I'm pretty open to changing mine, what would you suggest? This finance stuff is soooooooo boring. \n\nAlso, how do I survive the next 12 weeks lol
6	Fuck dude I caught that as a freshman and changed majors. I'll pour one out for you 
4	Has the boredom killed you yet OP? If so, RIP fallen comrade.
2	Entrepreneurship? Management?
1	Why are you in finance?\n\nIf it's to make money - you won't make it as easily as you will here.\n\nAnd if you're bored - don't let an internship in a rinky dink office determine your stance on the industry.\n\nLots of different types of jobs, lots of different types of finance companies, lots of different types of culture.\n\nAnd you have so much free time during your industry, fill it up. Boredom is a state of mind that can be resolved by something as simple as contemplating what boredom is. Ideally you should spend it researching or studying for a license/certification you can use to stick out and help you land a job. \n\nWork smart not hard please
1	Duude go into computer science, find a passion
1	Id just ignore your coworkers or joke around with them to pass the time. 
5	In your opinion, is looking at other people, when in a long term committed relationship, cheating?	Like... not porn. Real people. Wanting to look at other people and not wanting that to be limited or curbed at all... if it bothers the other person, shouldn't that be mitigated?\nAnd if you KNEW they were having a hard time with it, would you go to lengths to hide it or download an app to make them more discretely accessible?\nIt seems counter intuitive. I don't get the logic.\n\nI wouldn't consider myself insecure or jealous (INFP) but I'm starting g to wonder if I need to be more firm. Because it's escalating instead of getting better. 
5	Only if it goes beyond objectification 
4	I'm trying to be open minded about it. I'm not trying to control him or tell him what to do. I just have a limit.\nSometimes it feels like he's doing things deliberately. It doesn't even make sense to get caught at this shit!\n\nAside from that, why would anyone even need to look at other people. I genuinely do not understand. 
4	Ok, so as a person who used to do this here's my opinion.\n\nIt's natural, and I feel like you at least understand that. There's some understanding that it's ok to do on *some* level between the both of you.\n\n**That being said**, it sounds like you're beyond the point of minor or subtle glances. If you've mentioned it to him, it's now moved into a little bit of douchey territory. I think being more vocal about it will help your cause. I know from experience that if no one says that something I'm doing is wrong (even if I know it's not right), I'll push my boundaries until someone says something. You need to do that.\n\nA fair warning though - and this is again speaking from introspection. I used to (and sometimes till do) get upset and will push back on being called out on some behaviors (depending on how I'm doing mentally). If I'm in a healthy state I'll admit pretty quickly, that yeah, you're right; that was a little over the line. \n\nHowever, if I'm not in the best mental state I will act aggressively. I just want to set you up for the worst possible case scenario. It may get ugly, but nothing's worse than saying nothing and being a doormat. 
2	Thank you!!! This explains a lot and helps a ton. \n\nI hope everyone has a fantastic weekend!
2	Mine does it constantly.  After 17 years I accept that it's not getting better.
1	Agree with the objectification
1	Thank you \n
1	Every time I've been mad enough to punish him, he's liked it.... but I'm an INFP. GENUINELY, I just want to know the truth and move forward. No matter what they is or what that means.\n\nI'm tired. I don't know how much more I have to genuinely give. Which sucks. 
1	Question from a psyho, I mean psycho-analyzer	I''m beginning to think my BFF relationships  are often ESTP or similar to it.\nI will entertain your equally curious minds ny not revealing my MB type.\nMB describes this personality as having one sided relationships.  Explain this more please...\n(I don't think I'm psycho, just wanted to get your attention.  :)  )
7	What are you even asking 
3	In my experience, whatever's going on in front of me is more important than anything. Like what you're doing with the whole "I miss everyday companionship" is just way overthinking everything. The friend probably likes you but doesn't feel the need to keep telling you. In my experiences, I don't really tend to "miss" people unless something I'm doing reminds me of them. Even then it's more like "Oh wow I should call them sometime" and that's it lol. \n\nThat being said, it could be you haha. There's a girl who's been obsessed with me since 5th grade (I'm a junior in college now) and she always expects some kind of deep conversation or some shit from me when she texts or calls. Then if she wants to hang out, she'll like use words that trap me and I can't get out. If her dad wasn't the manager at a bank I wanna work at I'd tell her to fuck off. Just don't be overbearing and you'll be best friends with us forever 
2	Fellow ESTP's (Post about Jobs)	What are some jobs for high school and college students that match our personalities? I'm currently looking for a new job and would like to know what everyone thinks, thanks. 
6	Whoever says military, no. Definitely no. The *idea* of military is cool and all, but in execution, god no\n\n\nSports related things, at least for me. I'm going to school to be a teacher and a coach or do research in biomechanics depending on what I want to do with my master's
6	I love being a server. My daytime office job is a struggle because there isn't constant new fast paced challenge. 
3	I loved being a bicycle mechanic in college. I got payed well and did a lot of different stuff in a day. I sold bikes, chatted up customers, test rode the bikes I fixed, fixed the bikes...\n\nIt was cool! You also learn a hard skill that makes you respect other people who are working with their hands for a living. 
4	Bartending
3	I went to school for computer science and now I'm in a QA Automation job at an investment firm. To be honest I really enjoy the finance/stock market side of this job just as much as I enjoy programming. 
3	Sales, sporting venues, showbiz, theme parks 
2	I work as a recruiter. I get to interact and observe people all day, it's awesome. I also did sales which I loved and feel we are naturally great at 
1	Server then become a bartender. If you are a true ESTP you will excel in the restaurant industry. You get to multitask and make money talking with people. Plus you leave every shift with money. Who likes waiting to get paid? Not ESTP's! 
6	What are the little things that make you tick?	
5	[removed]
1	People who can't complete their basic job tasks. Like, you have one job. DO IT RIGHT. I'm not talking high up executives who's job is to take risks and develop. I mean people who are taking my order, or listening to what I have to say to complete a simple task. Like, JUST LISTEN AND DO YOU JOB CORRECTLY. 
1	People who sugarcoat shit when it's not going to solve anything but meh it's understandable why they sugarcoat "*feelings*"
4	What do you like about INTJs?	Alright, I'm an INTJ and I love my ESTP friend. He's a spontaneous, funny, charming, do-it-now-get-out-your-head kinda person. But not sure what he sees in me?
11	I think you guys receive enough opinions on this site.  
6	INTJs are fuckin smart. You guys play the long game and think about the future regularly. We wish you could get out of your head, but your mind fascinates us.
5	Don't do that type anymore.\n\nNo time for Judging types. They obviously are set in their ways and their closed mind is one I have no time to discover or be disappointed by. Sorry.

4	Any conflicts with ISTP's?/Types you typically don't get along with.	As an ISTP, I can think back very quickly to many times I found ESTP's I've encountered in my life the absolute bane of my existence, and it's not uncommon for me to resort to removing myself from situations with them to avoid it escalating into brawls. \nI was wondering-- Is this is a two way street, or is it just me? Do ESTP's also find ISTP's as aggravating as I find most ESTP's to be, or is there any type that grinds their gears at all? If so, have you ever had any consistently bad experiences with said type, and might you share it? Any trait in particular you hate, regardless of types?\n\nPersonally I've found ESTP's hit every single nerve I have on all of the typical ways you can annoy most introverts; By being loud, obnoxious, in your face, bossy, entitled, invading space, distracting, ect. It is made all the worse when you're an especially bullshit-resistant person that doesn't like to take anything lying down, whether it was intended to be an attack or not. 
7	If you're not directly affecting me by attacking me physically or someone I know, being obviously obnoxious or just plain weird, you're most likely background noise to me. I tend to get along with everyone I know.
6	I don't type other people, I have no fucking clue. I give everyone a first chance where I let them try to be themselves for that entire social interaction's duration for as long as possible before they piss me off and I cut them out, or until I've decided I like them and just stop trying to analyze them and go back to enjoying my life to its entirety, instead of just 99% of it
6	I have a great relationship with an ISTP. I manage his business. But we will often sit and shoot the breeze and we really enjoy each other's company. However, if I had to actually work with him regularly, I think some of his qualities would annoy me. BUT that is only because they are so like mine. Really, the main difference is that he is a bit more intellectual than me. \n\ntl;dr We get along pretty well.
4	I know of three ISTP-ESTP marriages so it definitely doesn't always go awry. They must have liked something about each other to stay together long enough to get married. One of these couples runs a restaurant business where she (ISTP) manages the budget, finances, and the food provisions, and he (ESTP) does a lot of the 'heavier' work and cooking.       \n    \nIt might be more difficult for two male or two female STPs to coexist in the same space without competition. I'm watching an ISTP-ESTP argument unfolding on another forum right now, both are girls. The ISTP picked a fight with the ESTP because ESTP was annoying her by being so scattered and superficial with her statements, while ISTP has a need for more order and deeper understanding with her dominant Ti. They've been going back and forth for a couple of days now, switching between arguing and trying to find some middle ground. But it's like the moment one of them gives way, the other tries to claim victory and the other doesn't want to concede and let her have the last word, so the argument just re-starts.

2	I've found the best people for me to work with, the ones that compliment me, that actually understand me and can in fact be similar to me, although in a reserved way, are ISTPs. \n\nTwo of the most important people in my life, that I depend on, are ISTP. I love you and I'm sorry if you find us annoying sometimes, we don't do it on purpose.\n\nI know you are the more quiet, reserved types but when we work together all the pieces just fall into place. Ying/yang. 
2	I've only met 2 Istp in recent years I'm sure about. Two females. With one we didn't know each other really well but we had great conversations through and through. Deep intellectual and psychological explanations. Using both our ti to unfold our ideas. She was great! The other one is super stuck in "robot mode" haha she's super stiff and talks with no emotional tone at all... \nWe don't really hang out, but same group of friends so we have to smile at each other. Even if there's no big love there haha (more indifference than anything else) \nBut yeah, in the end we are pretty similar with Istps they tend to have a bigger brain than ours (more intellectual less down to earth) so it depends on the person in the end 
1	I've known 3 ISTPs that I'm certain about (all guys). The first two I thought were absolute dickheads; inf Fe was incredibly apparent and I'm pretty sure they were both immature/unhealthy. One was a neo-Nazi, the other just an ass. The last one though I absolutely adore, we get along very well and I enjoy his sense of humor a lot. So it's not always a fail or anything like that.\n\nAs for other types, not that I don't like them, but I find a lot of feeler types somewhat exhausting to be around.
1	Any type honestly, I've had hit or miss versions of almost each type. INFJ I usually never like though.
1	My dad is an ISTP with a super strong Ti so his arguments typically come off as arrogant or condescending but I usually get along decently with other ISTPs.
3	[Academic] Perceptions of Self and Intimacy (20-35yo)	Hey there, hope you don't mind me attempting to pick your brains for a minute - I got good participation levels from other MBTI groups so I thought I'd extend it to all groups and try to get a more representative sample. FYI - the study is not collecting personality type information.\n\nMy dissertation for my masters in psychology is looking into one possible explanation for avoidance behaviours in forming intimate relationships. If you are 20-35yo and keen to contribute to my study then you can do so by following the link below. Any questions give me a shout, also I'm happy to discuss and hear your thoughts on the subject off the record if you want! It should't take too long but you're free to stop at any point anyway. It may cause some emotional distress as it involves some self evaluation so if you experience any discomfort and would like some guidance please get in touch.\n\nI will leave the survey open until the end of this week.\n\nCheers! \n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/F3BXHWN
19	My Favorite Description for ESTP	
4	I work side by side with an ESTP at one of my jobs and I find this to be very spot-on in many respects. I also appreciated the INFP (my type) as well. \n\nThanks for sharing! :)
7	Your Attachment Style	So there's this thing called the [Attachment Theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_in_adults#Styles) that basically places people into four different categories based off of how they get attached to the other people in their lives. I'm a dismissive avoidant, something I realized upon reading the descriptions and also the result I ended up getting on an attachment style test over on [personalityassessor.com](http://www.personalityassessor.com/attachment-styles/). Which one are you?
6	Secure. But really high avoidance with my parents. But I think that's more of a family dynamics thing than my specific personality.
4	DISMISSIVE-AVOIDANT! (but secure with my close friends)\n\n
3	Secure\n\n[For your analyzing pleasure](http://imgur.com/a/a8dCK)\n\n\nAlso I like how the post is already written like a TLDR with an optional long-ass thing to read. It's so ESTP, straight to the point and with an easy test that requires almost no thought\n\n\n/jerk
3	SECURE GANG LETS GO
2	Secure, low anxiety and avoidance in general. *BUT* higher avoidance with father.\n\nPeople who I feel secure opening up around:\n\n1) Closest Friend\n\n2) Romantic Partner\n\n3) Mom\n\n4) Dad
2	Secure, but avoidance with mother
2	fearful avoidant in everything, I guess it's just the way I was brought up in 
2	Attachment anxiety: Low\nAttachment avoidance: High\n\nRomantic partner: Secure\nClosest friend (ENFP) : Secure\nFather (ISTP) : Dismissing avoidant\nMother (ISFP) : Dismissing avoidant
6	What's your vibe music?	What do you chill to? What do you get amped to? What puts some swagger in your step?\n\n\nOfc that's a lot of music to answer with, and I probably couldn't do it without some thought but fuck it, since it's my OP I'll give it a shot\n\n\nVibe and chill: anything that sounds good. I'm pretty guilty of jamming to mainstream music that admittedly isn't great, but it sounds catchy and appealing to zone out to with it in the background. Mainly rap and pop. I'm in my 20s, so the songs we used to grow up listening to also fit, I'm never embarrassed to throw it back a little bit to the classic 2000s songs we all used to love\n\n\nPump up and swagger: Songs that are fast paced or have intensity to them. I also like a good chorus or hook for sure. Rap and trap/EDM for sure. [Money and the Power by Kid Ink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw7eiYrnNK8\n) for instance is one of my favorite songs to just get into the zone to. My university's football hype song is [Higher Ground by TNGHT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HzyUHxmkg0\n), when it bumps in the stadium I get ridiculously lifted although that atmosphere is already extremely electric anyway, it just adds to it\n\n\nSo what about you guys?
2	To keep myself from over complicating it, I'm going to answer with all Led Zeppelin(Since they're my fall back band anyway.):\n\nChill: "Going To California" "Over The Hills"\n\nPump Up: "Heartbreaker/Living Loving Woman" "The Ocean" "When The Levee Breaks" any of their meaner sounding tracks.\n\n
1	Chill - Recondite, Tipper, CFCF, Nicolas Jaar\n\nAmped - Gabriel & Dresden, Infected Mushroom, Black Flag, Social Distortion\n\nAlways down for Pink Floyd, CCR, Zepp, Black Sabbath at any time \n\nCan't do rap or country... total vibe killers.

7	Where ESTP's fail there is an INFJ to save the day.
5	Can we get r/estp in all caps? r/ESTP just feels right.
2	Nice work on the CSS
9	What's your favorite alcoholic beverage?	Are you a journey drinker or a destination drinker as well? Personally, I want to go from sober to hammered in as little time possible, it's either that or I don't drink. I prefer hard liquors, vodka and whiskey generally. I mostly do shots and drink very stiff mixed drinks or neat whiskey
3	To drink casually? Manhattan. \n\nTo get fucked up.. vodka redbull then run the night on long islands and gin and tonics
3	Tanqueray, soda water, lime juice. \n\nI don't really drink unless I am in a social situation. But I am typically the one who will get the most intoxicated... for no reason... on a Tuesday. If I'm drinking, I'm DRINKING.
2	Vodka Redbulls, Vegas Bombs, occasionally sex on the beach when I'm making drinks for the girls. That way I can play it off like I just had the ingredients out so might as well make it for myself too. 
2	Water / sparkling water! \n(no alcohol) 
2	Delirium Tremens for beer, Lagavulin for hard
1	I drink crown royal on the rocks. :) 
1	Dude, same. "Destination drinker"? I love it!
1	Long Islands!
1	I do both and I do them both with Old Crow.
1	flavored vodka straight no chaser
7	ESTP description by Victor Gulenko (Socionics SLE "Zhukov")	
1	Thanks. 
1	Wikisocion site has changed its domain from .org to .net. The full descriptions can now be found at this link:\nhttp://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=SLE_Profile_by_Gulenko
6	Description of ESTP's Introverted Feeling Fi	ESTps what do you think of this description of your Fi?    \n[Source](http://wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=SLE_by_Stratiyevskaya).    \nSLE and "Zhukov" are same as ESTP. SLE is an abbreviation for Sensory (Se) Logical (Ti) Extrovert.\n    .      \n\n**4th Function - Fi Introverted ethics**\n    \nThe ESTp does not build any illusions concerning his own ethical qualities, for he usually knows of his own unpleasant traits, such as initial distrustfulness and the habit to suspect poor motives in the actions of other people (as a consequence of having aspects of "ethics of relations" Fi and "intuition of possibilities" Ne in weak vulnerable positions). Unfortunately the SLE proceeds to form his personal relationships coming from his ethical "complexes" and fears and basing on his own mistrust and misunderstandings - this is one of the biggest and most serious problems of people of this type.\n\nThe ESTp is often worried that his own negative personal "imperfections" are apparent to people around him and serve to undo that positive image of "strict but fair leader" that he diligently tries to create in accordance with his "program" function and the function of his intellect. (Concerning the ethicalness of his own volitional program the SLE indeed does not harbor any illusions: of what kind of ethical rights and freedom of choice can there be any discussion if we're talking about Zhukov's autocratic authority and singularity of will, and about his stubbornness and propensity to dictate in respect to his partners?)\n\nHow other people relate to his opinions and his authority is of exceptional significance to the ESTp - this is much more important to him than for representatives of other sociotypes. Since his intellect and capability are of primary value to him, it is important to the SLE that these qualities are valued not only by him, but also by other people.\n\nTo the ESTp it is also important that he is perceived not only as he appears to be, but also as he could potentially be if he's treated and related to well. It is important that he is received and evaluated not only as he is, but also taking into consideration his positive ethical potential. (Precisely what his dual, the IEI, sees and evaluates well.) The SLE doesn't bring up immediately how he can be good, but speaks about this in hints and sometimes in jest. He is sufficiently prudent to not talk of this openly and directly. In addition, it seems out of place and inappropriate to him to voice praises to himself (since he is subconsiously oriented at his dual who sees this well).\n\nFor ESTp it is very important to be correctly understood, especially by people whom he intends to bring closer to himself. For such a person the SLE may willingly talk about his own nature, how he usually reacts to this or that behavior, what he likes and dislikes about other people.\n\nIt is important to the ESTp that other people don't assume bad intentions in his actions. Harshness and suspiciousness he saves for the enemies, while for his friends he's always ready to prove his good disposition by deeds. If a friend needs help providing which may bring trouble to himself, Zhukov may propose an equivalent service from his end, but one without negative consequences. (For example, if his friend requests him to sign guarantee obligations, the SLE will most likely refuse, but instead he may offer to lend a sum of money for a lengthy period of time.) Zhukov is ready to help not only his friends but also friends of his friends, of course granted that when circumstances arise these people will return the favor.\n\nAnd nevertheless for SLE it is not enough to be respected, it is also important to be loved. "To fall in love is not the main thing, the main thing is to make others fall in love with you." One of the problems that the SLE encounters in his personal relations is that he doesn't believe and trust in just any proof of love.\n\nBuilding his relations in conditions of understated ethical self-appraisal, the SLE fears to bridge the psychological distance - he fears that upon closer examination he won't be considered as attractive of a subject. Such an attitudes makes the SLE act in a very strained, illogical, and unnatural manner in terms of ethics of relations. Quite often, upon achieving some positive consideration and response, he himself will break off the relations (men of this type will actively reduce physical distance, but not personal and ethical one).\n\nRepresentatives of this type struggle with forming personal relations also because they have very distant idea about how this should be done. In a vaguely defined ethical situations they feel themselves helpless and disoriented.\n\nNeeding to control the primary initiative at any cost, the SLE creates a large number of ethical problems for himself, in at least by the fact that he doesn't allow freedom of choice to his partner (this is assuming a psychologically incompatible partner). The SLE begins to strongly suppress his partner with his own opinions, his own authority and strength: he starts to decide on everything for his partner, thinks through everything in advance, places his partner under severe conditions, not allowing for any objections from his or her end. For example, the SLE can immediately and unshakably specify the schedule and duration of meetings: "On Tuesdays and Thursday 1-2pm. Otherwise it's inconvenient for me." He may insist on specific conditions of meetings: "If we happen to run into each other by accident, act like we're not acquainted. Nobody should know that we have been meeting." Additionally, the SLE may act like this not because he is currently married. Even if right now he is single and free, it's not out of the question that in the future he will marry someone else, and right now he is worried that his current connection may somehow influence his future family relations. The SLE tries to develop his intuition and to be farsighted even if it's to the detriment of his current relations. That with such behavior he offends and deeply upsets his partner is a question of secondary importance to him, but precisely the one that starts causing problems in due time.\n\nThe SLE commits a serious mistake in attempting to take initiative in ethical matters. It's not enough for him to want to be viewed not as he really is but as he wishes to be seen. He goes further and attempts to model and build his relationships on this sufficiently unstable basis. And, it goes without saying, he wants these relationships to then develop in the way he wants them to develop. For this reason the SLE is not against sorting out his relations over and over again. Alas, this is something the SLE should not do! He won't find out anything good for himself. Since good relations and positive consideration are already apparent to him, while bad relations are not necessary to make explicit. Why strive to hear unpleasant things about oneself? Listening to bad and unpleasant things about himself only aggravates SLE's complexes and lowers his self-appraisal, which turns him into precisely that monster as he has been described. The SLE must not be given an occasion to feel that he is "bad" - this won't lead to anything positive. His own deficiencies should not be "poked into his face" - this only makes him more harsh and callous.\n\nNeither should one try to force the "good with fists", the "militant good" onto him - he doesn't believe in this type of "good".\n\nIn view of his pessimism and his weak intuition, the ESTp does not allow himself to fully believe in the idea of initial goodwill, unconditional love, and all-encompassing goodness. The ESTp only believes that which he sees for himself, that which unfolds right before his eyes, namely - in concrete relations with a concrete person in which he felt himself well.\n\nWith every partner the SLE feels himself in a way that he has been evaluated. Moreover, one doesn't need to tell him of this directly - the SLE is very perceptive of how his partner evaluates him by his look, by the tone of his voice, by the smile and the expressions on his face. Therefore, a partner may disappoint an ESTp with a low evaluation even earlier than the ESTp disappoints him by his behavior. The ESTp feels lack of prospects and promise of relations very keenly and starts to behave himself accordingly.\n\nIf the SLE feels that his partner's appraisal is too low, he may try to demonstratively raise it and try to show himself off in a better light than he thinks his partner sees him. By this the SLE attempts to give hints to his partner about how he should be treated and how to relate to him: only in a good and positive way, only in the most well-wishing and friendly form.\n\nThe SLE can also continue existing relations on a purely physical or formal level, while in the spiritual and intellectual sense they have already ended for him long time ago.\n\nIt is needed from morning to evening to tell ESTp how good, great, and kind he is - this is the only way to help him manage his ethical problems. For this very reason, positive relations for the ESTp develop in partnership with his dual the INFp, who, by nature of having strong intuition and optimism permits himself the luxury of seeing people as they present themselves. Being sincerely captivated by talents and merits of the ESTp, the INFp significantly boosts his self-appraisal, which then raises IEI's value in SLE's eyes. The SLE will be deeply grateful to a person who will convince him that he is actuality good, one who will convince him that he is second to none. Then the SLE with all his strength and forces will try to support and affirm this opinion.
5	Holy shit wall of text 
5	Im an INFJ with an ESTP partner and this made me feel like I was reading my partner's diary. Holy moly. But it explains a lot about our relationship which is pretty insanely compatible.
4	Good lord.\n\nI feel exposed.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Went on further to start reading the whole article, found lots of juicy stuff in there.\n\n"But the moment the ESTp relaxes and loosen up a little bit (this most frequently happens around guests) as he starts to 'fall out of his role' and feel embarrassed and perplexed by this very circumstance, and, consequently, he also starts to react sharply and sensitively to any observations and remarks. "\n\nThis killed me
2	interesting read
1	Guys this is a description of the ESTJ. In socionics the ESTp is equivalent to the ESTJ in MBTI, hence "4th function Fi" \n\nThe 4th function for ESTP's is Ni.
7	So what things actually make you want to be in a serious relationship with someone?	
12	People who are trustworthy, aren't afraid to be themselves, and don't suck to hang out with 
7	I like the more reserved ones. They usually have the more brilliant minds that I'm attracted to. I really like when someone is trustworthy, playful, witty, intimate, and more importantly has a strong understanding of their identity. 
4	for me it's intelligence, positivity, trust, a sense of humor (self-deprecating)  and maybe more importantly than anything an ability to understand me. She shows an ability to break me down and have me question my own thoughts and beliefs which helps me to grow as an individual. She understands and accepts my honest and blunt nature, and respects it even when it can come off as hurtful. Also, sexuality is super important, need a girl who wants to try new things, and has the same type of drive that i do. 
5	Smart, self-esteem in check, a little bit of an asshole, and has a silly side
3	Seeing how most ESTP's are highly practical, the things that make want to stay in a relationship is security and adventure. As long as I have those two things I'm pretty much set,
2	Confidence and lack of jealousy, possessiveness. Someone open minded, fun, smart. \n
1	Right now, not much :D\n\nIn theory, be fun, be outgoing, be relaxed, comfortable, down to do things, down to go to the gym, and generally nice with a touch of bad girl.
1	have to know them really well and be legitimately attracted to them. trust.\n\npersonally they have to be outgoing and fun and not high maintenance. basically xsfps period.
4	is there something wrong with me or the mbti tests?	hey to all you lovely estps. before i ask my qustion would like to give a preview of my life\n\nim a 20 years old i work in my father's dress shop who's managed by my brother. i was never good at school so i didn't continue after i graduate. i don't have any useful skill other than i know how to speak english in a third world country ( i suck in english grammar and i don't understand most words )\n\nthe reason that i post here is because i dont feel im a estp. but i done so many test and the result was the same so i thought i ask here.\n\nthe first thing that bothers me is that im not that active or full of energy i spend most of the day sleeping in my work place.\n\nthe second thing is that i'm not social in fact i never was. i don't have the talent to talk to people in a way that they like to listen. the best example i can give is after 20 years of my life i never had a girlfriend ( there was only 1 time i got a girl number but she stop answering my messages after 3 days i really don't know why :D )\n\ni never risk. im too scared of taking a risk so im not that kind guy that do crazy things\n\ni dont think fast in critical situation and i don't like challenges. if someone challenge me to something i try my best to avoid it.\n\ni don't like sports because i was never good at it\n\nis there something wrong with me or the MTI tests?
3	I was kinda thinking you maybe sounded a bit like me growing up until you said \n\n>i dont think fast in critical situation and i don't like challenges. if someone challenge me to something i try my best to avoid it.\n\nestps live for these kind of situations. 
2	Yeah, maybe you have the idea that you'd like to be that way when you answer but in reality you aren't 
2	ESTP with strict parents ?	hi all, \n\ni live with conservative immigrant parents who expect me to adhere to certain cultural social norms, this includes early curfews and not being allowed female friends. This is really hurting me because as an ESTP i crave social settings. \nI am forced to decline invites or attend and leave early.\n\nThis is having a feedback loop effect, where now it's affecting my social confidence... which makes things worse.\nI am still living with parents because i am an undergrad and am unable to financially support myself. \n\nCan y'all suggest ideas ? \n
3	I understand the difficulty. I used work (at a bike shop) as my opportunity to make friends and be social. Doing sales let me talk to girls and met cool people. Fixing bikes let me learn new things and feel like I was helping others have fun. \nI recommend it! (Or something like it)
3	Make a plan and gtfo when it's pheasible
2	This isn't going to work.\n\nWe don't get along with strict, close minded people. Any judging personality and us will butt heads. Get out asap. 
6	Do ESTPs fall in love?	Dating an ESTP and I'm having a hard time figuring her out. Sometimes she does something that I can interpret as romantic, but can also be interpreted as simply taking a logical course of action (especially after reading about you guys). She also seems to have a hard time catching on when I express subtle emotions. However she has given me these weird little gifts on occasion.\n\nAnyway, do ESTPs really ever develop deep romantic feelings?\n\nI'm an ENF/TP. So naturally I'm trying to figure you guys out and have feelings of emotional insecurity. Kidding not kidding.
9	Define "deep romantic feelings." :). I don't think I've ever felt that I "couldn't live without" someone. \n\nAnd I doubt she's not "catching on" - she just might not want to encourage your feelings for her that way. The gifts and her attention? That's how you know she's interested in being around you.
8	Yeah, we do fall in love. We're not emotionally insecure, but are relatively protective and aware of opening up, because being very realistic doesn't allow for the sappy love story and year long of honeymooning.\n\n\nI've said it before as it's the same for me, however it is she feels, she'll tell you straight up with her words, on her own time
5	Sometimes love is the logical course of action. :) If she's with you, then that's where she wants to be. \n\nYou know the thing where people go "I love you more" "no I love you more" yeah, my husband (INTJ) and I joke that he loves me more, and that I'm possibly a sociopath. Dating I basically tried to mimic his romantic behaviors. 
3	Define "deep romantic feelings." :). I don't think I've ever felt that I "couldn't live without" someone. \n\nAnd I doubt she's not "catching on" - she just might not want to encourage your feelings for her that way.

2	definitely
1	yeah man, i've definitely fallen in love with a girl. ranging from dumb 'i think i love you' crushes to 'i want to spend my life with you' sort of stuff. 
1	Theres no doubt that ESTPs are quite passionate people, so I could imagine they can develop these kinds of feelings, yeah.\nIn which way, however, is another question. My experience was... weird. I met an ESTP girl during student exchange, and she kinda flashed me (very likely because Im INTP guy). I liked her from the very first beginning, from the first time I talked to her - she was really unconventional in a way. I knew she had a boyfriend back where she came from though, so I knew that wouldnt work out. We just kept spending time together because we both had a very strange sense of humor, and Id describe myself as unconventional as well. I fell for her, I even noticed it, right after the first day we spent in town. The worst thing probably was that she played shed marry me to be able to stay. Another bad thing was she was touchy- so touchy actually that all my friends and even all the girls of my class kept thinking we had something together, even though it didnt ever go beyond one slight kiss. Id just be like "girl, what are you doing?", but thats probably down to the fact I live in Germany.\nEven though Im sure she didnt fell in love with me, I know she liked me, as she told me very personal things about herself. We told each other wed stay in contact as friends.\nThen she got back, and two days there, she told me she broke up with her boyfriend (shed been with him for months). I didnt know what to write, I tried something consoling. \nRight the next day, she told me she had a new one, about five years older than her (we were both 15). I felt betrayed, not because of that, but because she kept sending me pics with him in bed, while knowing I still had feelings for her. Obviously it was fun to her, so I stopped answering. I asked a few people, and many had similar experiences.\n(Btw I also know she loved her family while showing everyone around her akward pics of her dad and claimed she hated her mom. Im a bit that way, but she went further than I ever would). \nAfter all? Yes, I think ESTPs can have deep romantic feelings, but as they dont care so much about what other people think, their crush will switch person as soon as they get bored. \nExcuse my English, please.
8	I've noticed texting with ESTPs can be difficult at times - what's the best way to go about carrying a conversation with you via text?	
7	As an estp, I just get distracted and forget about it. I usually am more involved with what I'm doing in the moment. And my phone is always the last things on my mind. But I don't if that's true for everyone else. 
8	I'm usually not itching to carry on a text conversation. If whoever I'm texting is keeping the conversation alive, I'll usually keep responding.
7	[deleted]
2	if you're attributing this specifically as an ESTP thing, my explanation would be that the ESTP is probably busy, or the conversation isn't stimulating them, or they're simply pre-occupied.  \n\nHowever, I think this applies broadly across types. For example, I will text the shit out of someone that I'm really crushing on. And I was having a hard time with an INFP that wouldn't text me back frequently.
6	People trying to be around you and approach you.	Sometimes I notice that when I'm relaxed and having the most fun with life, all of a sudden a small crowd will have formed around me and will be smiling also. Then, afterwards people will approach me and try to get that to happen again. Almost as if they are looking to me to make them happy or to fill some gap. Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I'm imagining all of it.\n\nEDIT: Wasn't sure if I should put this here or in /r/adhd.
6	Nah, that shit happens. I'm pretty charismatic, and that draws people in because even if they can't do it themselves, they can pull from the energy you radiate
3	Story of our lives, this is where you pull out a product to sell them
7	ESTP vs ISTP, how do you guys tell?	I was reading about how ESTPs are supposed to be very good at picking up on peoples' motivations and it made me think maybe I am ESTP
11	Sources tell me that one is introverted and one is extroverted
6	ESTP and ISTP are pretty different. Sometimes bad tests can end up mislabeling them. If I answer a lot of "introvert v extrovert" Im always on the line and very often it can be one question pushes me over the line for either one. \n\nIn general, I feel like its easier to tell types by peoples motivations for their actions rather than the actions themselves. \n\nIm an ESTP and my brother is an ISTP. One thing I find to be very true is ISTP likes to seek out action and adventure (skydiving, rollercoasters, etc) whereas the ESTP tends to look at life in general as a constant adventure or a game.\n\nISTP also tend to be very focused and specific and will utilize a lot of energy on one or a few very specific things, whereas ESTP tends to be very broad and doesnt necessarily dive as deep into things, but tends to have many more interests and/or plates spinning.\n\nESTP tends to be super blunt in their manner of speech bordering on offensive. lol ISTP is far more measured.\n\nAs leaders, ESTP tends to focus on how people work together: How can i maximize the teams strengths to succeed. Whereas ISTP tends to focus on either themselves or how things/objects work together. (How can i maximize my own abilities to get the most use out of myself to help the team?)\n\n(not the best example, but...)\n\nLebron James - ESTP (team player, team ball = team win)\n\nKobe Bryant - ISTP (my focus, my skill = team win)
2	I couldn't tell you how I know, because I don't when know how I do it. It's almost a 6th sense. I tend to be more skeptical of people I general so maybe I'm just parnoid. Maybe it's Maybelline.
1	The biggest difference I have seen in myself and my friend/mentor (ISTP) is that he is bit more intellectual than me. He enjoys staying on top of the business world, stocks, politics, news, etc. Where I live much more in the real world. But he very much has the real-world interests (such as gardening, flying his plane, etc.)
0	One of them is antisocial, the other isn't. 
5	ESTP as an electrical engineer?	I'm an ESTP considering returning to school for electrical engineering, and was wondering if any ESTPs here work in electrical engineering and how you fit in that career.
3	Just do what your passionate about and what you like to learn bro 
3	I'm a CS major but I've taken quite a few EE classes (I'm more of a CE major really). I like EE a lot, sometimes I wish I had just gone into it. I find it more challenging than CS, but CS may just come more naturally to me because I'm a big math guy. 
2	Student in EE in Australia. Thoroughly enjoying it so far.
1	I love it. New design + R & D is a great fit. \nJam session with Hw design. \nFirmware and Power supply/IO  peripheral circuits. \nMotherboard design etc... \n\nHell yes man do it!\n\n 
2	Are you guys actually all that into MBTI?	
6	I love it! I could talk about that shit for hours!
5	...yes...
3	I love to analyze the different types and their collective behaviors. It gets to be really interesting when you can predict what someone is going to do in response to something just from knowing their MBTI.
3	I have been OBSESSED since I was put on to it - hold up in a room for a week during hurricane Sandy. At this point, I can fairly say I have a pretty good handle on it. (sometimes I think moreso than a lot of the more simplistic "type sites") \n\nI think a lot of people/sites/tests tend to mislabel people which causes a lot of confusion. I noticed very often people are too literal and more focused on the result of someones actions as opposed to their motivations for their actions which is ultimately what the test is about.\n\nIll tell you straight up the BEST test BY FARRRRR is https://celebritytypes.com\n\nIts not as nice or built out as some of the other sites and it lacks the marketing/design element that many of the other popular MBTI sites have. BUT I find that they are more informed and have a much better test with better results. 
2	Oh sure, I'm not saying everyone with the same type is exactly the same - interaction is necessary on a more personal level if you truly want to get to know someone, but I do find that the MBTI is a decent guideline to follow.
1	I mainly stick to the ESTP/INFJ duality section, toss in some socionomics. Someone posted a meme saying she was INFJ. Got bored Googled it. Took multiple tests. Found my type. Have probably logged a good 50 hours of research at this point. Still not an expert.
15	Banning Discord Invites	Can we make a new rule within our subreddit that Discord invites or invites to talk MBTI is not allowed? Then can we also go through and take them all down? I'm tired of the clutter. \n\nEdit: Asking us questions about how we operate is cool. Saying go to this external link is not.
8	I agree. This sub is pretty slow anyways, so having the feed just discord invites from top to bottom kind of sucks.
5	I agree. But the only mod here isn't active so we'll just have to downvote and roast like usual
3	ESTP Music?	Does anyone have any good music choices? I just heard the song Machine by Misterwives and I really like it. I was wondering if there is any music out there that tend to vibe with ESTPs
4	I just vibe to whatever sounds good, whatever is appealing
4	60's-2000's Hard Rock, EDM, and 80s alt (New Wave/Post-Punk)
2	Hardstyle can fit into ESTP's style as well!\n\nE - very lively\n\nS - structured drums\n\nT - »Hard«style can not fit into F\n\nP - the melody
2	/r/estpmusic exists btw
1	Anything by Tipper, Recondite, or Darkside is really wild.\nCan't go wrong with the Helen Burns album by Flea (from RHCP).\nand of course... M|O|O|N's self titled EP is great too!
1	i like tribal music like scandnivian folk or war drums and this is a playlist i cant listen to something but it\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6loWrABr8gA&list=PLaZgz3keZw9ZnVhpxTQKNb8qyEMsc_GKj
1	This is my [SoundCloud](soundcloud.com/caleb-baty) I'm a estp and produce music! 
2	Man, I love this guy. Am I right to assume he's an ESTP?	
1	I enjoyed that video so much, thanks. I agree Scott is an ESTP, I think so. And that's not the first time I've known an ESTP to use a baseball bat as a weapon. lol\n\n[This guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJiZ2HgV5E0) is probably  an ESTP.\n\nAnd [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dNiLa0IMKg) too. \n\n\n
8	What are you favourite ESTP activities?	List your MBTI type and your favorite activities to do.\nI'll list mine. Having as it comes adventures (sneaking into places etc), Learning about things I like (The Bible, Charisma, NLP, hypnosis, different sorts of skills ect), Weightlifting, Skateboarding, baseball, running around, Minecraft <3, Talking with a friend or two, Chess and other strategic games, Eating good food, Learning about health things, Reddit, Funny videos and documentaries about things in my scope of interests. Also airsoft and being a libertarian.\n\n\nEdit: we SP's need a convention or a meet up to get to know each other. We are so much fun and adventurous!
6	Traveling, exploring and having adventures, making anything whatsoever fun, sports, weightlifting, fast paced video games, drinking and the nightlife, talking to people and meeting new folks, listening to music while doing almost everything, flight, going fast in general, mountain activities, etc\n\nLong list 
4	ESTP. Skateboarding, long boarding, travelling to hot countries with friends and experiencing the food, the sites, the nightlife, meeting attractive women, music, singing, music festivals, movies, video games, Reddit and some self help books by people like Mark Manson and Coach Corey Wayne.
6	Parties, hiking, camping, dirtbikes, motorcycles, shooting, skydiving, bars, drinking, sex, driving, guitar, concerts\n\n> going fast in general\n\nyup.
4	ESTP - activities in no particular order - bonfire parties, camping, bowling, drunk shopping (especially at street festivals), concerts, adding chaos to my husband's life, brunch, sewing (without a pattern), hanging out on the deck with the neighbors, coming up with new life plans, abandoning new life plans... 
3	Flying, horseback riding, surfing, sailing, racing, drifting, riding motorcycles, dirt bikes, dancing, flirting, sex, drinking, scuba diving, shooting
3	I don't have hobbies just yet but anything that gets my heart rate up maximizes my interests. Probably doesn't help that I have ADHD.
2	Discord
1	CLIFF DIVING
9	Please stop posting Discord invites here	They all get downvoted and there's a tons of them that are all the same. Just post on /r/mbti. 
4	how good you guys are in small talks?	hey guys. i like to know how good you guys are in small talks? or socializing with others like opening a good conversation?
11	Very. It's like our thing
11	It depends what we consider small talks. I'm good at it I  guess; but I hate it from the bottom of my heart. I want to know people's dreams, what they resonate with... Not what they ate for breakfast!
2	I can make small talk with a brick wall.
1	Frivolous, small talk is easy. What I'm poor at is talking without planning and in detail about emotions or something technical.
0	Tbh, what makes small talk is understanding what people want. Why do you think the first thing most people say to someone is "Hi, how are you?" It's because people want to talk about themselves. The best first question to ask anyone is... "What do you do for fun?!" Just keep the questions going off of that and you are pretty much set. \n\nIt's a conscious activity. We all want to be  playing 2v2 ping-pong for a pitcher of beer but you gotta chat those losers up before they are willing to play for beer like that. 
8	ESTP data needed for spreadsheet! (w/ link to spreadsheet)	I'm making a spreadsheet to see if there's any connection between MBTI and Gardner Multiple Intelligences.\nWe need more ESTP data, since only 2 out of 79 respondents are ESTP so far.\n\nhttp://www.literacynet.org/mi/assessment/findyourstrengths.html \nIf you could take this test and comment your results that would be a huge help!\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hYz6JjtkL2ZCS6MtisP1AacC2GI5Ep-FDT87vIemDCg/edit?usp=sharing \nHere is the spreadsheet for those who are interested. Right now its mostly populated with users from discord servers, so when I enter your data I'm going to put r_(username)\n\nMake sure to comment all 8 scores your get!\n\nThanks for listening!

0	my best friend in high school was an estp?	so im an infp and am very unique and i often anoyed people i was very anoying because i only like to just ''shit talk'' i was never serious in convosation and just wanted to make jokes and talk shit as in absolute shit as in i qoute myself''when i smoke weed i can fly if i jump off a mountain'' but tho others get anoyed by this my estp friend in high school realy didnt give a fik and acted so himself?hence we become bnest friends?
10	Jesus fucking christ, maybe you should've focused on other things in high school besides smoking weed and your friend's personality type\n\n\nWhat are you even asking
3	What the fuck?
32	Hey y'all	I'm pretty sure we're the fucking best 
12	Not even a fuckin competition 
9	Hell yeah, my friend!
9	Hands. Fucking. Down.
8	You're goddamn right
11	Fuckin yeah we are
1	I mean, that's what everybody tells me, so :p
17	intp: I really appreciate ESTPs	Y'all are cool - definitely my favorite type. That's all I wanted to say
6	I appreciate you INTPs... you all seem like you are always down to ride bikes and come up with cool ideas! 
5	well, many believe we could all use a bit more [TP](https://youtu.be/3O7_7r0cXMs?t=43s) in the world
5	Love you too man
4	The two types I've never expected to have a type-loving circle jerk. What a time to be alive! :)
3	Thank you! One of my best friends is an INTP! I appreciate you too :)
3	I've always gotten along best with INTPs :) thanks, dude:)
2	My favorite friend is an INTP. I love her the most. 
1	Intps are easily my favorite type. 
3	My friend's doing a survey on MBTI in the workplace and needs more ESTPs!	
7	Boosting ESTP self esteem	Hey guys, I am an xNFJ friend of one of you, amazing ESTPs. I clearly see what my friend is going through right now. In short, it has to do with some job and friendship related struggles. I know that the best way to help an ESTP with those struggles is to leave him alone with finding a solution to problems. Also "talking emotions" isn't really the best way I can help an ESTP to feel better. I don't want to be a friend-psychologist as I usually am with the other types. The only way I can help is to be a "cheerleader" friend. \n\nAny ideas? What would be the best way to help a friends self-esteem? What boosts your self-esteem?
3	It will come by itself. I think deep down most Estps just seek to be accepted. Being a cheerleader is cool, but just listening to that person and saying "I accept you" is one of the best gestures you could ever achieve. \nFi polar can mean "I don't deserve love" \n\n\n\n\n\nUnless he's too stubborn and will push you away. :) Good luck!!!
3	Just invite him/her out to do something, talk to them about mundane stuff, and don't respond positively to negative responses. Just kind of ignore them and move onto new topics instead of trying to cheerlead the negative thought away. You won't be able to anyways. Talking emotions isn't a horrible idea. Just don't beat around the bush if you're going to do it. And maybe explain why it makes you feel bad when they're down, instead of simply asking why they feel down. Chances are, if their self esteem is low, it's because they have doubts about what others think about them, not doubts about themselves. So trying to get to the bottom of *their* emotions is a lot less useful than showing them yours.
3	Leave him alone and let life continue as normal, he'll do what he needs to do
4	INFJ here, willing to learn from you(s)	I don't know the technical term, but we have the same cognitive functions, in an inverted order. I got Ni, Fe, Ti, Se and you have Se, Ti, Fe, Ni.\n\nI'm curious to know how you Se, Ti and Se-Ti combinaison manifests themselves. What comes easily to you? What situations are hard or complicated?\n\nFor anyone willing to help me out :)\nThanks in advance!
9	Talking, flirting and making friends is easy. I don't do emotions though and I don't open up. 
4	It's as if we were two sides of the same coin. INFJs try to understand the world so that they can grasp reality; and we want everything to have meaning. \nThen many opposite behaviours. Blunt to a Fault; huge trouble to acknowledge others' feeling or even presence. We also have trouble planning in the mid term. X years from now equals "Dream" we can deal with that! \nThe next week, yes, it can be planned. But everything between a couple of weeks away and "10 years dream" is super blurry.\nTrying out new stuff is exciting,  even if it means scary because it's a new situation.  We thrive on those.  We do feel fear when it comes to meeting people and trying new activities.  It's just that we easily plow through it anyway.  Then the power of Habits kicks in and it becomes easy...\nINFJs are super fascinating,  because many Estps would love to have your Ni, it looks like a super power!
2	/u/sabotsailor and /u/ESTPresence have nailed it for the most part, agreed.\n\nSocial interactions are like being so familiar with a race track, you can drive the whole thing blindfolded with inverted steering. It's cake. Little to no emotion, no sympathy, blunt and honest.\n\n\nThis piece: \n>Then, there is this idea of "flow" from Se. But, for Se Dom it's almost subconscious. We do not turn Se on and off like an auxiliary function. It's just there. Hence, the stereotype of body language reading. This is true. It's super easy with a bit of focus to see everything going on with someone else 's body. Micro expression, small hand movements, even breathing speed and intensity. Up to us to determine (with Ti) What that means... Or we can just ask bluntly "you made a cringy face just now, what is that for?" which, believe it or not, is very well received by people. It shows you actually care xD\n\nis perfect. Goes along with my little analogy, you can see straight through people in a way and determine what and where they're going with something based on how they look, sound, and their actions. You can catch their bullshit before it falls right out of their mouth! \n\nVery willing to say "fuck it, we'll do it live", always have an idea for the future. Easily able to think on our feet, or at least I am. Flexible and reactive, never really structured. \n\n\nMy favorite and most relatable emotion is adrenaline and the rush with it. \n\nI'm not claustrophobic at all, but I could see it. I also have a large bed but still sleep on one side of it, probably bi products of the military. \n\n\nFeel free to ask anything else
5	Do you ever find yourself easily dismissing/ignoring/letting go your own emotions?	Share opinions, please. I find that most of my xSTP friends help me to "let things go" if I am stuck in my own emotions. It's nice since I would otherwise dive deep into the rabbit hole of overthinking "why do I feel this way blah blah". (I'm I/ENFJ)\n\nHence, I wondered how are you dealing with your own feels?
9	90% of the time I tend not to linger on why I feel some way. Usually I observe that I feel some way and then move on (whilst remembering what caused that emotion). \n\nOccasionally if I'm in a down mood (tired, sad about something), I will linger there for a little bit. Sometimes it even inspires me to call/text people I normally don't think of and say something more touching/personal than I normally would.
5	Yes, we are great at "shoving the emotions down". :)     (this is not acceptance, but escape)\n\nExperiencing a feeling 100% is a path of growth for Estps,  even ad hoc asking why we felt that way.\n\nYou are 100% right in your statement,  but that's not a great thing to do either.\n
3	Definitely\n\n\nRecognize the problem, come up with a solution, dump it all and move forward until it's relevant again, try again with what I learned last time\n\n\n
5	Ever wondered how many subscribers there are in each of the MBTI subreddits? Well I collected the data in this post. Tell me your interpretation of the results.	general MBTI subreddit: 14,701\n\nall SJs: 8,137 // \nESTJ: 745 // \nESFJ: 732 // \nISTJ: 4,055 // \nISFJ: 2,605\n\nall SPs: 8,137 // \nESTP: 920 // \nESFP: 804 // \nISTP: 4,447 // \nISFP: 2,205\n\nall NFs: 56,097 // \nENFP: 11,243 // \nENFJ: 3,016 // \nINFP: 22,166 // \nINFJ: 19,672\n\nall NTs: 75,270 // \nENTP: 9,400 // \nENTJ: 4,167 // \nINTP: 31,444 // \nINTJ: 30,259\n\nCompare the numbers with this estimated frequency of personality types: https://mypersonality.info/personality-types/population-gender/\n\nNote: I'll be posting this on all of the MBTI subreddits.\n
5	Amazing how the SJs and SPs are equal.
7	Because I couldn't help it:\n\n**Data:**\nhttp://imgur.com/a/0CcG6\n\n\n\n**Pie Chart by Introversion/Extraverion:**\nhttp://imgur.com/a/I90vs\n\n\n\n**Bar Chart by Type:**\nhttp://imgur.com/a/9hE3I\n\n\n\n**Pie Chart by Type:**\nhttp://imgur.com/a/i5AT9\n\n\n**Pie by Bar Type:**\nhttp://i.imgur.com/MiPIl.jpg
4	ENTP here.\n\nobviously the 'analytical' groups would have the most members due to their nature for finding and seeking new ways to categorise people i guess. Putting people in labels is effective even though there are definite amount of anomalies. Therefore they would try to find answers to their new hypothesis by joining communities which also love to do the same. blahblah intution\n\nNFs are the more friendly bunch especially INFP. They probably were like 'yay new friends'. they are excited finding people like them.  THis is all seems like a very N thing.  same thing about introversion, if you are introverted you are way more liekly to be on an MBTI subreddit,\n\nSJs and SPs are the least likely people to actively search for an MBTI subreddit or MBTI related thing in my personal experience anyway. Therefore all the numbers add up init
2	ESTP 4th from bottom, INFJ 4th from top. Coincidence, I think not.
1	Nice job! I always thought that sensors don't really seek to understand themselves on self-help mediums like reddit discussions because the world is very much sensor-oriented haha
6	Do you fabulous ESTP folk like intuitive conversation?	My BF can logically order what I say, in an intuitive conversation, and he'll acknowledge that I can tie it all together, in the end, but he has very little patience for intuitive conversation.\nJust wondering if that's something that needs to be developed or if it's something I should stop trying for 🤓
10	What do you mean by intuitive conversation?  
5	I have an INTP SO. I love having wild conversations with her because her imagination runs deep. she might start in the middle of an idea, but eventually she gets to the beginning and end. I like doing the things she thinks about a lot. \nShe will get bothered when I challenge her at every point. However, I only do it to see where she came from and where shes going. It helps me understand the idea as a whole.\nI think ESTPs (me anyways) get a high from acting on an idea because its cool. My INTP gets a high from thinking about the idea in a million billion different ways that are really cool.  
5	As like with what /u/ESTPresence said, what exactly do you mean here?
5	ENFP speaking for her ESTP dad here - Yes, he goes all out with the philosophical and abstract conversations that I have with him. We often talk about the future of the planet, of humanity; what might exist beyond the realm of our perception, beyond what we can see/touch/hear etc. How many galaxies we share our immediate universe with. And it doesn't stop there. We cover a plethora of topics in depth (his Ni goes into depth and my Ne keeps it moving) and I can see that this conversation enriches him as much as it does me. \n\nHe is nearly 60, is the boss of a huge company, has traveled the world multiple times over, and has more life experience than almost anyone I know. He reminds me of my INFJ best friend at times, but he's still very much an ESTP in all of his action-oriented glory. \n\nI did also subject another ESTP friend of mine (before I knew anything about MBTI) to a spiel on atoms and vibrational energies and stuff and he did genuinely listen to the whole thing for a good two hours or so. I think it exhausted him though, but tbh I would have bailed on that conversation myself, thinking back.\n\nAwesome guy. ESTP's are some of my favourite people ever and deserve way more credit.
1	They don't get it
1	We've been talking about moral law, invincible ignorance, what's a sin and what isn't... actually, since I posted this, we've talked quite a lot!\nOne of the things I love about my SO ESTP is that he's so open minded! But... yeah. If I start day dreaming, and rambling, he just sits back and laughs at me 🤓\n\nThank you 😊
7	In case you guys need a pick-me-up this morning :)	
6	Thanks. Sitting in bed. Gearing up to end a chapter. I'm dropping my resignation papers today. Moving to a new firm with better benefits, more money, client facing, and tons of travel. Heaven. \n\nTime to kick this pig! 
3	Here's some very Se- and Fe-flavored music for y'all. The world as a whole is kind of confusing and depressing right now. I think it's important for us betas (xSTP & xNFJ) to form enclaves where we celebrate the positive things and keep up morale.\n\nFeel free to share anything else that puts you in a good mood in the comments! :)

14	An ESTP I know is one of my favorite people ever.. basically a second mom. Wanted to also praise ESTPs in general in this topic.	I am an ISFJ.\n\nThe ESTP I know is basically my aunt (complicated). She had a rough life growing up poor for a long time (to the point she had to learn to climb trees to steal food from other people's trees) but eventually my parents took her in when I was year old in exchange for having a permanent baby sitter and house cleaner (she gets paid!).  She's the same age as my mom, and has 3 kids of her own that live in another country that she has to keep track and occasionally help them financially.\n\nOne of the things I've always admired was how relaxed and easygoing and how easy it is for her to go with the flow (unlike me, my brother and parents we can be kinda closeminded/judgmental at times). She has an amazing sense of humor, it's really easy to get her to laugh. She can take jokes really well but she's capable of dishing some blunt/savage jokes herself. \n\nI've moved out from my parents house recently but she still lives with my parents. Just recently for almost half a year my (xSFJ?) grandmother from my moms side visited. She means well but can be pretty demanding of what she wants and also is in pretty bad physical condition. The ESTP kinda ended up being her caretaker since my mom and dad have full time jobs. However, ESTP never complained to our mom and dad and always did everything in her power to take care of her well despite the grandma's overbearing attitude at times. When I had lunch with the ESTP after my grandma left the worst ESTP complained was "Yeah, it sucked." and that was it.\n\nI don't know how it is for other ESTPs but I just admire the amount of patience and diligence she had when she wants/needs to do something. When my brother and I were kids, she would sometimes walk to Burger King get food for us WITH HER OWN MONEY and bring it to us at school which I was very grateful for.\n\nShe doesn't have a driver's license so generally she has to really on family or friends to drive her around places or she has to walk. However she geniunely enjoys walking, (window) shopping and hanging out with friends out of town so I'm glad my parents sometimes let her loose often without scolding since she naturally loves going out.\n\nI know a bunch of ESTPs get stereotyped as those liars, cheaters, obnoxious, athletes, impulsive, stupid, etc.. However, after being half-raised by her my whole life I know how ESTPs really are. I'm grateful for the main ESTP in my life and respect  that you guys are down to earth, honest and willing to do what you can to get things done for people you care about. I feel like you guys' tertiary Fe is really underrated. I guess it may not show in undeveloped/immature ESTPs but I really like the mix of External Feeings / Values  mixed with Se-Ti easygoing honesty. It makes for someone who's really easy to get along and lovable.\n\nThank you ESTPs.
4	Well as an ESTP, thank you
3	Well, thx! It's rare to get praised like this...\nI would argue that this loyalty and commitment comes from our Fi and not Fe. Fe is more how we come out to people, with a smile on our face and try to accommodate them.\nOnce we truly care, you get one of our drivers with Ni, our buried Fi which represents our "code of honor". This is what gives this "knightly devotion" to the people we love. If you are this close to an Estp,  good for you! \nHe/she will never let you down.
3	Thank you. She sounds a lot more nurturing than me though.
1	The good ESTPs are really good. I'll just leave it at that.
1	[deleted]
7	Suggestion	We should put a generic thing about how to <blank> ESTPs in the sidebar or wiki or something, a sticky perhaps
6	Sure, sounds good. Are you willing to do it though? Seems that none of us is ready to invest at all into this subreddit lol.\n(I certainly wouldn't take the responsibility xD) \nGeneral topic ideas:\nHow to befriend an Estp: be honest and fun\nHow to date an Estp: be honest and fun\nHow to have an Estp on your side: be honest and fun\nHow to have an Estp do his work properly: be honest and fun\nHow to have deep conversations with an Estp: be honest and fun\n\nWait! My spider senses are tickling (Ti)... Do we have a pattern here??? Oo
7	How to piss off ESTPs: Tell us to do something

7	Good Self-Help Books ESTP'ers	Looking for some self-help, meaningful reads that have helped you all either A) understand yourself better or B) understand more characteristics/ attributes of our type, or C) good texts that apply to this sub. Thanks.
2	This isn't specifically for ESTPs but I just read this book about how to identify other's types more efficiently.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Art-SpeedReading-People-Speak-Language/dp/0316845183
2	Depends what you are looking for. \nSpiritual / philosophy stuff? \nHustle books on success and building a better life?\nUnderstanding others' emotions?  \nLearning about a skill or a methodology? \n\nBasically it depends on which function you feel needs to be "pumped"  right now... 
4	ESTP/ISFJ advice	So, I am an ISFJ and I have been going out with an ESTP for a couple of months. But, I met him when he had just broken up with his ex-fiance (they lived together for 4 years) a year ago. It did not end well, since she cheated on him. At that time, he seemed fine and kept saying he was not feeling anything. Months passed and by the time I met him again, he looked like he changed a lot, but just superficially. Now he goes to the gym everyday, listens to some weird philosophy podcast from Patrice O'neal, anti-feminist to say the least, and says he doesn't want a relationship ever again. \nTruth is, he does. From the things he told me, he seems to be just trying to find a girl with the same bitchy and loud personality and appearance to, maybe, take on her all the things he could not do before. Or maybe he wanna find someone like her again and pretend nothing ever happened. \nI told him, what I think before. I've told him that the longer you stay not moving on from your ex-cheating girl the better she looks. He's not listening though. \n\nMy question is: from a former ESTP, if you were in the  same situation as him, what do you think people could do to help you move on?\n\nPS: We are not dating anymore. I am trying to move on as well. But I'm asking because I care, still.
3	> from a former ESTP\n\nWhat do you mean by former? This guy sounds A LOT like me.. I was in a relationship for 4 years, she didn't cheat but did some really shady stuff. Now it's been 3 years and I have basically sworn off relationships, go to the gym every day, and fuck around because it's fun. \n\nI know from my experience that outside people aren't going to "help him move on". As an ESTP, I'm not going to believe something unless I understand *why* I need to believe it; and a lot of times that comes from inside me.\n\nTime and self-realization are his friends.
2	The issue with ESTP is that as long as you keep telling them to do something,  they will stir away from it.\nWhatever you say, do not force anything onto him...\nHe seems to be lost,  which is fine and happens a lot. We love random philosophy,  life's advice etc...\nIf you have certain stuff in video/podcast form, easy to digest,  just send those random stuff.\nMaybe he will take it the wrong way,but when he will be ready might even come back to you and ask for it..\nSo: casually dropping life advices would work in the long run. \nFor those issues my favorite book would be :\n-The 7 habits of highly effective people by Stephen covey (estp according to celebrity types haha)\n-Letting go: a pathway to surrender by Davis Hawkins \n-The subtle art of not giving a fuck (maybe he's not ready for that one, itight comfort him in his behaviour xD)\nOverall books/philosophy that strive to give a Buddhist approach to the world, accepting injustice etc...\nSeems like he needs some Ni pump right now ;)\n\nQuestion though:\nIf you don't date him anymore,  what would you help? Don't you consider its not your problem anymore? \n(I'm genuinely curious, and surprised,not judging)
3	Am I really an ESTP?	Just did the Myer-Briggs test and came up with ESTP, reading the description of an ESTP seemed to fit well, but reading other people describe themselves on here made me doubt that I'm actually an ESTP. I read the other personality types and none of them really describe what I think I am. \n\nWhy I might be an ESTP:\nI get bored easy, but love problem solving, I deal with reality and don't care too much about theory's, I have a crass sense of humor, I hate rules just for rules sake, I would much prefer to do a sport/activity than watch others do it, but get bored when I plateau at the sport/activity, I hate monotonous work\n\nWhy I may not be an ESTP:\n\nDespite having an okay IQ (130) I've never excelled at anything, I don't get along really well with others (I'm too offensive for most people) so I've never been popular.... I did just enough to get through high school and college (2.76 gpa), I don't really give a fuck what others think about me, yet I can take things more personally than I ought to. \n\n\nI'm also interested in learning about careers that ESTPs find enjoyable, I am working in local government supervising 11 people, completing state reports about the landfills, doing requests for bids on equipment and services and I hate my job. I also work for 2 people that I have little respect for, one thinks is probably an Intp that loves to throw out bizarre ideas and expects everyone to understand his wacky ideas, the other is probably an ENTJ that's loves to be in control yet doesn't want to learn anything. \n
7	I dunno man, you sound pretty ESTP to me
2	You sound so like me as an ESTP. Crass sense of humor and not liking rules. I work at a tech "startup" now. I spend lots of time solving problems and there really aren't many rules at all. I decide when I work and how I go about it. I recommend that environment for us.
1	I'm an estp working for the government. Since we are problem solvers, and most governments have a good amount of problems, it's easy to connect that with this personality type.
1	\>an okay IQ (130)\n\nwhat did he mean by this?
1	Kind of unrelated, but I am thinking of venturing into the same field and am wondering how much you make.
6	ESTP Sex Advice	I'm an INFJ and my husband is an ESTP. We've been married over eleven years. We're not at all on the same page concerning our sex life and I want that to change. Frequency being the biggest issue. The only times he tries to take initiative is really late a night at bed time. We both work full time and have two kids. I do everything in the house: cooking, laundry, dishes, cleaning, ect. At the end of the day I'm so exhausted it rarely happens. He's consistently hurt when I say, "I'm so tired. Why didn't you say something earlier." He takes it as rejection and that I don't want him. I've suggested better times. Like when the kids are napping on the weekend or after they've gone to bed during the week. But he says those times aren't spontaneous enough and not when he's in the mood. He says it's got to be on my terms or not at all, which is ironic because I feel like he's doing the same thing. So when I offer (which I'll admit is not as often as it should be) he usually takes it, but apparently it doesn't count because it wasn't his suggestion. He doesn't want to get counseling and doesn't feel like talking about it. I can understand where he's coming from, feeling rejected when you just want to love your spouse sucks. But I feel like if this was such an important issue to him he'd be more willing to try at different times rather than an hour after I've already gone to bed. He definitely has a higher sex drive than I do too, which only compounds our issues. I've also told him that aside from completely exhaustion, it's frustrating when I say I'm going to get ready to bed and he stays up another hour or longer watching TV or playing a game, then once he comes to bed remembers he has a wife he finds attractive, who's more than likely asleep by this point. If I'm conscious enough, I feel like a complete afterthought at that point. And it's not that I don't want him. I love my husband and when we can have sex it's great. I just don't understand when I tell him you have a 90% chance of hearing yes around this time of day as opposed to a 2% late at night, why he wouldn't be a little more willing. But at this point he's given up trying because he's felt rejected for eleven years. Any advice on encouraging him to meet me in the middle? 
3	I don't know the answer, but I can think of some things you could try.\n\n1. Be enthusiastically opposite a few times sprinkled into the days you deny so it can maybe give some more legitimacy to your off days. Ie. "Hahaha oh babe I'm sleepy right now but remember Monday last week? Mmmm hmmm let's do that again this weekend [time or whenever you actually want] ok love you good night."\n\n2. You should have no problem with him getting off on his own, so maybe you could "recommend" a way for him to do that. For example, earlier in the day you could show him a photo you think might turn him on, and say, "oh I really find this pic hot, I wanted to show it to you" or say something more natural for your relationship. But then later you can be in bed and say, "Mmmm yeah and don't forget about that hot pic from earlier, sorry I'm tired but go crazy for me love you zzzz..." Basically I'm suggesting you justify his masturebation by actively endorsing it, thereby deferring the issue until next time. This can continue forever if you get increasingly creative with your material.\n\n3. Frame it as a problem for *him* to solve for *you*. Maybe the next time you're going away for a weekend without him you could make it seem like you're worried about yourself getting off while you're away. Reformulate this into a time you *must* to get off because you'll have no other time and going without for so long will drive you crazy.\n\n\nCounselling is a good idea in any relationship, healthy or otherwise... but it kind of seems like maybe you want to go so you have a platform to air your grievances, and he can probably already imagine what those are because you've expressed them several times. So yes, counselling good, but this situation maybe he's just not going to be receptive for whatever reason.\n\nOk good luck. You should also know, when I read somebody replying with such a lengthy post in this subreddit I am usually surprised because we'll start something and just cancel it when it seems like a lot of work for no return.
4	INFJs and ESTPs are so weird. But then again that's why you guys are perfect for each other. What a match made in indecisive heaven.
3	So it's always been this way? I'm dating an INFJ and we were sorta like that, but she just told me she's always horny so we have sex like constantly now\n
3	Honestly, as an ESTP, I get horny everytime I'm in bed with my girl, even if we're just laying next to each other quietly, a boner shall rise. I love crazy passionate sex, and I think that things just tend to snowball when you play with ESTPs. Kind of like going to a nightclub, if you don't drink and just stand there like a strawman, it's going to suck, just go home, but if you're going to get some vodka down your throat and party all night, it's going to be crazyyyyyyyyy. Get it? Snowball effect. Just start out by doing something romantic but freneticly passionate, unexpectedly. Just start making out with him like if you were frenzy in love with him and go down on him and give him a good time, and do it like you love it. Go *frenzyyyy* on him, we love excitement. Don't plan sex, that's just boring, just do it, surprise him. For me sex is a way to show my love, the way I love the most, I don't fuck with a bored face on, I fuck with all the passion that I have. So, just go crazy, drink a Red Bull before bed and just do it! Sorry if this was a bit too graphic but just keeping it real lmao.
2	If you both did the housework you'd get to bed faster. Also a vacation for you two alone sounds fun
2	hey there. I think the issue for him is that he doesn't think that it's "fun" or "sponteanous" enough if you tell him that "it's better to have sex in the afternoon during the weekend when the kids are asleep". \nI don't think it's an hour/schedule issue, but more a way on how you present it. \nIt's totally understandable that you have a lot on your plates and you're exhausted (by the way, you should talk honestly to him about it and should get him to help. ESTPs are doers after all, you just need to show them the directions and they will get at it). \nSo maybe try a different approach. When the kids are asleep on the weekend, take the lead and be flirty, don't hesitate to tease him, be extra tactile. It's more a question of making the moment fun and sponteanous rather than "let's have sex at this time instead" matter
1	May I suggest that for ESTP, spontaneity is basically an overload of stability? The more stable/routine everything in life of an ESTP, the more the person craves spontaneity?\n\nAlso, the spontaneous behaviour isn't ever that random. I bet not all people are aware of the underlying cause of their desired that just appear out of nowhere. (IRL not out of nowhere, there was a precedence of multiple events that lead to a final event X.) Have you tried to use a little bit of your Ni to see all the events and predict your husband's desires?\n\nI am no expert in advising about these things though, so take my questions are genuine curiosity :)
1	Make him horny when you feel like having sex and make it seem like it was his idea. 
1	Hmmm maybe you could inspire him by initiating? Say, go to bed and let him go watch TV, and then get up and go tease him sexually, get him aroused. Maybe if you do this, once or more, you'll get the idea into his mind that his attractive wife is right there available, and he will prefer coming to you than doing those other things.
8	A short video summary of the ESTP personality type	Hey Guys :) \nI am creating short video summaries for each type and just finished the ESTP video.\nThis is only a very short introduction but I thought that I'd let you know :)\n\nEnjoy! and let me know what you think :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu-lfHPv0g8
3	Very accurate. I'd add a weakness, that of asympathy and bluntness.\n\nAdditionally, INFJ make good partners because their exact opposite nature calms us down and makes everything a little more even
2	I realize that you just pulled stock images, but they are overwhelmingly of white men. Try for some diversity. \n\nWhy is breaking up frequently a 'fun fact' under 'hobbies'?\n\nI'd say for weaknesses, changing jobs frequently.  \n\nAnd I think aysmpathy and bluntness are strengths. :)
6	What type can we not relate to the most	Also, in your opinion, what type do we dislike the most/ cant understand?
10	INFJ. Just extremely wish-washy and impossible to talk to. Trust me, I've tried. I usually can find a way to befriend anyone but there's something infuriating about INFJs that I haven't been able to figure out yet.
8	INFP for all of the above.
5	I get along with pretty much everyone.
5	On a very very surface level maybe infj, because we tend to have two opposite behaviours. Once we get deeper though and learn to know the person better, I'd say Infp would be the most infuriating... \nInfj, on the other hand, once you get passed the seemingly passive and "disconnected"  nature, you may realise that you have a lot more in common with them... \nHardest types to get along with on a deeper level: infp, estp, enfp\nEasiest type to dig with: infj, isfj, intj

1	ESTP for Elizabeth Warren. 
5	ESTP in the grip	So I know ISTP's have their Ti-Ni loop. What about us? What does that look like? And how to get out of it?
4	So dom tert loops are different than being in the grip.\n\nESTP's and ENFJ's would have a Se-Fe loop. Entailing impulsiveness in the face of others. Actions and choices made simply to evoke a visible emotional response.\n\nLoops happen to extroverts when they check their extroverted functions with there other extroverted functions without ever introducing their inner self. So the solution to this would be to check yourself with your Ti-Ni.\n\nIs this action necessary? Would I want someone to do this to me? Does it help me accomplish my ultimate goal? The answers to these questions require some degree of introspection which, if evoked, might lead to more thought out decision making.\n\nI honestly can't speak to the legitimacy of this framework. It makes sense, but I haven't found a reputable source on this.
4	ESTP Advice, Please	Okay, so, I'm an ESFP and have a really good friend who is ESTP. Basically, something happened and he got pretty angry at me for about a week. We both wanted to talk it out and smooth over the issue  so we could get back to how our friendship was before(very Fe of him, haha). \n\nHowever, I'm not sure if this is me just being insecure, it feels like there's something different. Like, we act the exact same when we're hanging out but I can tell something is off, he's a little more distant than before. \n\nI just want to understand what he's thinking, or how an ESTP would react in this sort of situation? Should I talk to him about this? Or Should I give him more space and time to get over it before things can truly go back to how they were? Or am I just being a hyper-sensitive ESFP? \n\nAny advice would be massively appreciated, and thanks for enduring that very long post, haha.
5	Okay ESTP here, this happens to me way more often than I would like. Anytime anything happens in my friendships or relationships, I find that I tend to push them away from me. I feel hurt and I close myself off. The worst thing to do, for me at least, is to pretend it didn't happen. I usually won't bring it up. But especially if you think it was your fault, I will think you are trying to take an easy way out and nothing will ever get resolved. \n\nI don't know what happened exactly. But most times, the way to fix it is to be a little overly affectionate or friendly for a day or two and that will show me that you are REALLY trying to fix whatever happened. But that's for me. He/She may be a little different in how they respond to your signs of rebuilding. \n\nThis whole post probably sounds really selfish because this is how I would like all my problems resolved, ideally. And every situation is different.
4	I'm an estp. In this situation I completely understand how he feels. I too keep people at a distance if there is some kind of problem or issue between us. It's usually temporary if the other person really wants to fix the issues we have between each other. Like the other poster mentioned give him a little time and show you want to make things right between you.

1	When I got overly frustrated in a situation with people, I pull my emotional ripcord. I essentially push away whoever it is, because I don't need/want it in my life at that time. \n\nGranted, some situations don't allow me to do this. It's easy to detach and relax, then come back to the issue when I'm ready to face it. \n\nWhen I try to confront the issue, that doesn't mean I'm over it. I'm simply ready to try talking about it again.
1	I'm ESTP and I can relate to your friend very much. When I disagree or fight with a friend (or get annoyed by them- females are terrible) I tend to just back away. I an attitude of if I feel unhappy or uncomfortable in a relationship it needs to end. I find I disconnect very easily if I don't have tons of attachment end I'm not an emotional person so this happens quite a bit. 
1	Honestly try to smooth it out then if it doesnt work then back off if you can't.
3	ESTP type and personality disorders? Other ESTP encounters?	Hello fellow ESTPs and any others who might have a comment to make. What are your thoughts on our type and what personality disorders might be common? Antisocial, Sociopathy, and Narcissistic come to mind. I have many traits of all these. I am obviously self diagnosing when I consider these things in relation to me, but curious to hear what you guys have to say about yourselves or other ESTPs around you. Any other personality disorders/quirks, too!\n\nAlso, I've never met another ESTP (that I am aware of) IRL. If you guys have, what traits did they have? I can't wait to meet another ESTP some day. \n\nedit: Just found this link in the top section of r/mbti: https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/54bt57/results_are_in_the_most_sociopathic_mbti_type_is/\n
4	Hey!  I think ADD/ADHD are commonly associated with ESTP.  I know I've dealt with that growing up.  As I got older, and realized my type, I wondered if they were in fact interchangeable.  Did/do I actually have ADD or was I just more interested in the world around me instead of following some curriculum enforced upon me that I saw no practical use in?\n\nI'm curious why you say antisocial? The extroverted part I think would indicate you'd prefer being social since that's your natural way to energize.
2	I'm like 95% sure that my ESTP step-sister (who I love dearly) has undiagnosed bi polar disorder. I think it definitely stands out in her mbti. Because she has undiagnosed bi polar disorder, she is a very unhealthy ESTP. She is socially inappropriate, very impulsive, and brutally honest. During manic episodes, these traits are 10x more apparent.\n\n\nAlso, whether you like him or not, Donald Trump is a textbook ESTP as well as a textbook Narcissist.
3	ESTPs and tattoos!	Do you have any? What are they? Why did you get them?\n\nI'll start! (In order from first to last)\n\n1. Cross bones on my right butt cheek because it was a 20 minute time bonus for an alley cat.\n2. 13 on me leg because it was Friday the 13th. My buddy said lets get tatted.\n3. Dagger through and eye crying blood for another race.\n4. Flying eyeball monster. \n5. Grim Reaper with a scythe and rose to mark year ten since my father passed. 
5	I don't have any tattoos mainly for personal moral reasons however I don't think I could EVER commit to a tattoo. If I did it would take a million years to find one I would like forever.
2	One tattoo:  full sleeve of (actual) bio-mech. Twisted shreds of metal, overlays of sharp bones, clock gears, and its pulled together with a background of neural synatics \n\nIt actually has a deep meaning to me but I tell everyone "I thought it was a cool idea" 
2	I have all kinds of tattoos. they sort of work together. I think they were all cool at some point. ladies love them, even though they're what most people would say are "stupid".
1	1. Skull in a war bonnet on my left wrist. I just liked the design tbh. No special meaning. \n2. Snake on my left hand. Again, no particular meaning. 
1	I'm about to get angel wings on the back of my neck.
3	Who do we love?	I'm looking for new friendships, relationships and anything else. What personality types do we mesh with? I figure that other ESTPs are a go, but who else? I mean we can get along with just about anyone, but I'm looking for people who I enjoy to be around. Any help? Thanks guys!
5	Everyone is unique and demands investment on our side if you want a deeper relationship.  It's freaking hard as we tend to remain on a surface level... \nType to hang out with---> almost everyone? \nType to avoid---> Infp (super draining once we get closer), Istj,  Enfp can be draining as well... Then it depends on who the person is.\nEven Enfj who are supposedly a good match can be super tiring,  because they tend to judge our shaky morals.\nSo my advice would be. Just hop in and see what happens, but do not invest too much in people who will not reciprocate. When that happens it's super annoying and feels like a huge waste of time. 
4	I feel like there is literally something I can dislike and like about every personality type. I really enjoy ESFP, also easy going and also a party person. I like ENFP's but ugh stop stealing my attention!!!
3	My best friend is an ISFJ. We are quite different, but mesh fairly well. \n\nI have lots of ENFP friends I like to party/casually hangout with. Always have lots of fun with them. INFPs are pretty cool, too, but tend to wear on me sooner.\n\nMy dad is an ISTP and I love hanging out with him. So chill. \n\nxNTJs STRESS ME OUT. They are so..... intense. I feel like they're digging into my soul. I tend to think they're cool, but want them to leave quickly. 
2	AVOID\nESTJ : too concerned about order, law and rules. Can't be bothered\n\nFor an awesome partner in crime but might end up in jail (or worse) : ENTP \n(i.e : what ENTPs think about us : https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/3gue9b/what_do_you_guys_think_about_estps/)\n\n
2	**Don't get along with**:\n\n* I experienced some conflict with a coworker recently, whom I'm pretty sure is **ESTJ**. She pressured me into completing a task her way, ignoring my attempts to reach a compromise. In the end I just smirked and told her to talk to our boss. I don't respond well to coercion. \n\n* **INTJ**: to echo /u/threefootnick, I can't handle this type's intensity. Went on a date with one; felt like I walked into an interrogation. I guess I just don't mesh well with hard -J types.\n\n**Close Friends**:\n\n* **INFJ**: pretty ironic considering that we're polar opposites, but she compliments me in so many positive ways. \n\n*  **ESFJ**: helps control my impulsivity and frivolous spending lol\n\n* **ENFP**: easy to have fun with because they share my "down for whatever" mentality
10	Who loves us?	As an estp I feel sometimes it's hard to find a mate that actually loves me. Often times my boyfriends see me as a cool friend, someone they love to hang out with, etc but they don't like me as a partner.\n\nI've found a lot of the times the guys I date prefer to be with someone I would consider boring, inferior to me in many ways. My question is, what personalities actually love us? \n\nEdit: Met an estp in real life and we were flirting nonstop, it felt great being with someone like me. He made it clear he'd ask me out in a heartbeat if he didn't already have a girl. From now on I'll be on the lookout for guys just like me or other super confident types :P 
13	dogs love us :P
9	Ni-doms, so INFJ and INTJ.
8	Thank you for asking this! I'm an estp guy and I don't have trouble talking to girls, but I am horrible at building relationships. I feel like nobody really loves me. But I get needy as fuck. \n\nI have no solution, but I wanted to add to this also.

4	People like me at first because I'm charming, witty, and sexy. But then I either A) Get bored and move on  or B) They see who I really am and are over it. I don't know who would love me. xNTJs tend to like me but I find them too intense. My bff/person I really actually love loves me and she is an ISFJ. 
5	My girlfriend is an ISFJ and she adores me. Have to admit that I adore her too. \n\nYou think its a matter of low confidence? Maybe they feel overshadowed by your high confidence (just brainstorming)? 
4	I can't speak for all ISTPs but I love ESTPs 
3	Maybe you're being too easy, or too friendly.\n\n\nAs a guy, I know that I'm always way more attracted to girls who aren't so easy, and can also dish out playful insults back at me, for example. \n\n
3	I'm ENFJ and I love ESTPs! But I believe it always takes some time, even months, before the actual chemistry starts to go on. I guess it happens because of your self-confidence - you don't see the need to open up right away to ignite the "chemistry". Based on my observations, you seem to be very very confident without needing to "trap" people with your vulnerabilities and inner issues for the sake of feeling intimacy with a partner.\n\nAnother thing is being blunt. If someone actually likes you and wants to take you out on a date may potentially be afraid of your insensitive response. My ESTP friends struggles with saying things that may be offensive or triggering to others, even though his/her intention was otherwise to make a joke or rationally point out the truth. That may scare some people off unless they are other ESTPs or mature enough to get that joke :p
2	I love you ESTPs :) 
2	[deleted]
2	I can't speak for all INTPs obviously, but I judging from the ESTPs I've met, whether or not I like them is a hit-or-miss kind of deal. I really admire you guy's intensity and direct-ness! :P
1	Hey! So I just commented on this earlier but I just found out what the personality types of two people who love me to death. One of my best friends and this one girl who used to be my manager but really really cares about me a lot. They're both ENFJ 
1	INFJs. They are duals. Also INFJs have Fi in the id, which is very powerful, and has to deal with deep, personal love. They'll be most likely to truly see the ESTP for who they are and genuinely appreciate their qualities.
9	What school rules did you break?	
4	I think I missed more days of school than I went and still graduated with high honors. Three fights on school property, we had a fight club in the soccer/wrestling locker room, and dress code was broken on a daily.
2	- Elementary:\nMom was PTA so I was on a short leash. Skipped school a couple of times. \n\n- Middle school:\nHonors classes. Slept through most of the day because of partying/sex the night before. \n\n- High School:\nPresident/Vice president of computer club, played basketball and ran track. We fixed teachers computers which gave us access to write our own hall passes. Talked with our Coach and he convinced the school to assignthe old teacher's lounge as our computer office. Moved in a shit ton of broken computers too. The best part, two private bathrooms. They used them as a storage area so no one ever came into our office. Can't count how many girls I'd taken in there. Such a sweet setup. \n\nMoved to another school. More college prep and more money. That meant less room to skate. The highlight for this school was me fucking a girlfriend during lunch in a computer lab with a huge TV. Didn't know it at the time but the classroom for connecting schools together. Like a teleconferencing type deal. Apparently the other school didn't appreciate the show we put on. Luckily her dad was a big deal attorney and nothing really happened. 
2	Left school grounds everyday of my two years there to go out and eat away from our closed campus. Only got caught once and talked my way out of it from the teacher. 
2	Smoking weed/cigarettes on campus and ditching class.
2	I went to a private school with a strict dress code. On days following report cards, we would get a "dress down" day (basically we could wear jeans) if we had a parent's signature on our report card. \n\nWhile this thrilled all of my classmates, I didn't like the idea of this reward system (it felt like giving a rat a piece of cheese for following a maze). Even though I got straight A's, I wouldn't get my parent's signature and would show up to school in full dress code. I would get off to the fact that I wasn't breaking any rules while still sticking it to school that they couldn't control me with rewards. \n\nTL;DR: I was a very angsty teenager
1	I got high on campus a lot. I was never in uniform. Skipped school quite a bit. Smoked cigarettes during lunch outside. Left to get Starbucks almost daily. Nothing like that big I guess. 
1	I tried to follow rules but was extremely disengaged, sometimes bowed to peer preassure.
4	Any estps in Tampa/ St Pete?	Im INFP, new to Tampa/St Pete and would love to know more ESTPs. Any takers?\n
1	Greetings! I am an INTP hijacking an ETSP/J's reddit account. Lets play video games???
4	ISTP fiancé and ESTP son	.
6	I'm going to have to side with your fiance on this one, but there needs to be some limits. Obviously, having no life preserver, especially on a four year old is a bad idea. I say use the helicoptering to your advantage by coming along. Ideally, you being around should help balance out these scenarios.
3	Awe thats kind of cute that he wants to be a part of the little guys life.  Try not to worry too much 😂 I know you mean well because you love him but just trust that God will take care of him ans try not to be too frustrated avout the situation.
2	[deleted]
2	Congratulations on your ESTP boy ! haha I'm sorry to say that you will worry for the rest of your life. I mean as a mom you will already worry naturally but having a ESTP as a child is a source of worry because of they constant quest for thrill and adventures. \n\nThe thing is, your son must have a great relationship with your ISTP fiancé, they both are hands on, adventures, sensing people. In a way it's great that you ISTP fiancé is showing and teaching your son how to channel his ESTP needs for constant activities and stimulation. It's better that your son is informed and taught how to properly use the correct tools and indeed recognize the danger at a young age. Because not matter what you do or say, he will eventually just go for it. So better be prepared now. \nWhat you CAN do nevertheless is setting the limits with your ISTP partners. For example, yes you can teach our kids how to built a tree house, but you have to make sure they are wearing helmets on when doing so. \n\nWish you all the best :)
2	I recommend teaching your ESTP to practice safety in all activities and why explain why safety is important. My ESTP father drives as safe as he possibly can so it's possible.
5	Blue Collar Jobs	~Optional introductory bio~\nSo I've gone throughout my life thinking I was meant to be a STEM type of guy. That I was going to be that technician or whatever because that's all it seemed like I would fit into.\n\nCue college. I majored in computer science, it ended up being a very difficult major that I just couldn't find joy in a year in. The only reason I survived that major is because of my last two years of college involved taking kung fu classes on the side. It was something I really enjoyed and still self teach three years later. It was something I was deeply saddened by for having to leave following graduation. Anyway, I can't really program or follow a lot of computational stuff. I have some understanding, but I've yet to get a job in the field. \n\nI tried going back to school two years after the CS degree (worked for a theater, climbing to assistant manager in that time) to get a degree in mechanical engineering. However, that ended up being a far worse match than computer science. I was not able to function in classes. I was too stressed to look at half of my subjects if I could understand them, and my grades couldn't get up. So in the end, I came to the conclusion that STEM really isn't for me. So with that personal bio out of the way for context, let me get to the main part.\n\n~Question~\nI'm considering looking at blue collar jobs instead of white collar since I seem to be running into constant compatibility issues. I don't think I'd enjoy sales either as I'm not exactly the most pleasant person when someone is flat out wrong. What kind of blue collar jobs do you fellow ESTPs do? What drew you to it? What qualifications, if any, do I need? If applicable, how did you manage to move out of your area?\n\n
2	This is the constant questioning of Estps when it comes to more technical and abstract jobs...\nI'm still a student but I'm in a abstract field (cognitive psychology and communication), and theory sucks ass.\nBut,  we can turn the tables, using this genius brain of ours to make it fun ;) \nBlue collar jobs might be as boring as the rest, it's pretty much on you to find a way to morph it into something you love.\nOr else, boredom will be found EVERYWHERE.  
10	What do you think about INFJs?	They are not only the rarest type, but our polar opposites as well. My brother is one of them. Have you guys met any INFJs in your lives? What were they like?
8	*infj lurking*
5	My sister and mother are infjs. They drive me completely up the wall. I never ever get to be right about anything because it's 2 against 1. I also always find myself stating an argument and then when I'm over it 30 minutes later they are still discussing it amongst themselves. It drives me crazy. They are also very co-depdent with each other so it's always them and me. Very frustrating..
2	I've been to INFJ's in my life only recently. I met a couple INFJs in the past 5 months, one of them has become one of my best friends, I could take a bullet for her, the other one I haven't invested that much yet, but the same "smoothness" appears when we interact with each other.\nOverall I'd say that the interactions are almost always great. It depends mostly on the maturity of both the INFJ and ESTP. \nI could definitely see an ESTP dismiss the INFJ quickly and vice versa, because one is too crazy moving from places to places (us ESTP) and that's super shallow and tiring for the INFJ. On the other hand, to see this person sitting there and do nothing in his/her life(the INFJ) seems like a waste of my time for ESTPs.\nOnce you get through this barrier... \nINFJs are super funny, they have those Ni moments when they say stupid shit out of nowhere, the most ridiculous and over the top jokes, to which we can as ESTP one up them, and carry on the stupidity. How many times have we gone waaaaaaaayy too far with my INFJ friends, with the other around finding us too stupid or sick or gross xD Nothing seems to offend INFJs, or if that does, they will tell you so that you know where the line is. They also know a lot about people and how to behave in society, or at least how to pretend haha. Also to get in touch with your being, pushing each other, the ESTP will push the INFJ to get out of his/her shell and try stuff by being supportive and positive. And the INFJ will teach the ESTP patience and listening of the others' emotions/ states.\nThis relationship is just an amazing experience, INFJS I love you!!!\n\n\nI wonder what the experience of others would be... How about you with your brother?
1	You cant get them to DO anything.
2	Parking delimma: how can I convince an ESTP not to park in an area that it's logical to park in?	Hello, /r/ESTP.\n\nI live in an HOA community.  We have neighborhood agreements in place about parking: each person is allowed one spot in front of their unit.  In addition, each person has a remote garage for their personal use.  There is also a guest-parking area that is remote from the living units. \n\nNot everyone keeps their personal car by their units at all times.  Some do.  Some park their personal car in their remote garage, leaving the space in front of their unit open for visitors or as a less-encumbered view of a nearby lake.  \n\nOne of our neighbors is an ESTP.  They recognize that it's a community rule to only use one parking place in front of their unit.  \n\nBut.  \n\nSince the space in front of the next door unit is seldom used, it is logical to have visiting friends and family park there (not as far to walk as the guest parking area). \n\nThe person whose space they are using has serious boundary issues.  She believes it is wrong for the ESTP to park in the space due to community "rules."  She prefers to keep it open for the view or for visitors.  The ESTP using her space is a constant aggravation to her.  She has asked the ESTP to cease and desist, and cannot understand why they continue to park there. \n\nThe ESTP  doesn't care about the neighborhood rule: it's convenient for their guests to park there, and it's logical that the space should be used rather than empty.  They don't care about the rule, but about the convenience of themselves and their guests. \n\nI am on the HOA board, and am tired of receiving complaints about the parking.  I understand the ESTP's logic, but it does go against the community rule.\n\nI'm hoping you can give me some ideas on how to persuade the ESTP to follow the community rule.   I can't think of any benefit to them of following it.   \n\nThank you for your time and your suggestions.  \n\n**tl;dr:  the title says it.**
6	One of the reasons I've always hated the idea of an HOA; the only stories I've ever heard have been negative regarding the organization as a whole.\n\nCool, so you have an unwritten 'agreement' about how you all think parking should work. Neato. But whoops! We let someone in who doesn't like a policy set by a homeowners association; oh no, that never happens!\n\nYep, it does. Especially if the rule is very vague, and doesn't actually enforce your preferences. So good for him, he found a loophole that benefits him and doesn't actually go against any policies he signed on or agreed to.\n\nSo either approach him directly telling him your thoughts and those of the community without being passive/flighty, or change the rules so he isn't allowed to do that.
4	If it's not an explicitly written rule, then it's not an enforceable rule. It's like how an agreement is not the same as a legally binding contract. \n\nSo the simple thing is to either say there is indeed no rule for it or make it an explicit rule.
4	[ENTJ] I don't really see the purpose of the rule for one... and like others have said: if it's not explicitly a rule, then you can't really do much about it.  \n\nAnd personally speaking, I think it's a rather petty rule...
2	I can't imagine living in an HOA...& I imagine that your ESTP HATES IT!\n\nWhat would work for me is to know how much of a pain in the ass it is for you to deal with this BS...unless he dislikes you & your board. I hate making people I like do more work than necessary, but on the contrary: if I dislike you then I'd revel in it. 
2	Never mind, from what I've found the MB system is considered bad science. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnum_effect\n\n
1	get an entp . . . they speak pretty much the same language but the entps are a hell of a lot better at BSing people 
5	The dreaded Fi burried within...	Hi fellow Estps,  I wanted to address one of my discoveries here. I recently understood the importance to getting in touch with my Fi. To understand my own emotions, process them properly,  then talk to them with closed ones via Fe (the infamous estp "inner circle") \nI would recommend the power of now from eckhart tolle and more specifically letting go by David Hawkins which explains the importance of processing the emotions and letting them go...\nThat helped me a lot get perspective in my life, stop running for the next shiny thing (enneagram 7 behaviour that reinforced this trait), but just enjoy the moment and saying to yourself that you're all good...\nHave you had similar experiences? \nWhat is your relationship with Fi and your emotions in general?\nI'd love to hear more about it! \n\nPs: I still have lots of trouble dealing with high Fi behaviour, as I tend to annoy the heck out of them, even when I'm trying xD infp are complicated haha
3	Fi isn't necessarily about getting in touch with your own feelings... any type can do this without engaging in Fi behavior. 
1	I'm curious: How do you, as an ESTP, distinguish your Fi from your Fe?
1	So true. I have an ENFP mom an ENFP sister and an ISFP sister. I'm an ESTP.
1	All types are able to use Fi. Some better than others. INFP and ISFP are walking sets of Fi feeling/value incarnate. Fi means you have an inner set of things you value. 
1	[Survey] 800+ Respondents on MBTI Relationships/Friendships Survey - Check Out the Results and Contribute!	Hey there, ESTPs (and non-ESTP lurkers)! A few months ago, my good friend /u/ashirviskas developed an MBTI Relationships Survey to determine which MBTI Types had the best relationships with which types, what each of the genders rated their ongoing/terminated relationships, how their intertype friendships fare, etc.  By chance, I happened to see this guy post the survey in /r/intj asking for some input for the presentation of his results, and so I’ve been helping him out with it since then… and this is what we’ve come up with (so far)!  We invite you to tell us how your relationship with your Duals, Mirrors, etc., fare in this relationship survey! \n\n&nbsp; \n&nbsp;\n\n**[Link to Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScTCIkcxO30RBnpXQIGXV0xaRqj5LFytF_LPmE-DdrD9-qSoA/viewform?c=0&w=1)**\n\n**[Link to Survey Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yFpUbw92VH_BGrVf-FMngyCdtERYVvvGOEL_T58kw9Q)**\n\n&nbsp; \n&nbsp;\n\n**About the Survey:**\n\nAll together, the survey is going to ask you about 1-2 romantic relationships (current and former, as well as duration), and 1-3 friendships.  It’s okay if you haven’t been in a relationship! We’d still love to receive your feedback based on your friendships/relationships with other types… if you’re not 100% sure about your friends’ or past/current S.O. types, try to give a best guess as to what their type might be (unsure is an option for friendships, but this isn’t as useful for finding correlations in the data).  \n\n&nbsp; \n\nIf you’re not confident about doing this, maybe try asking the person to take the test (a good quality cognitive functions test, rather than “preferences” tests that can be rather inaccurate), or read about the 8 cognitive functions… and see which ones the person most likely uses as their dom/aux configuration; an assessment on the inferior (which can result in the “grip”) or your “stressor” function might be useful as well. \n\n&nbsp; \n&nbsp;\n\n**Personal Biases and Stereotyping:**\n\nTry to remove personal biases that you may have regarding other people in your current (and past) life! It’s not helpful to us (or to you) if you stereotype or inaccurately categorize people (i.e. *“I dislike Person X because they’re so literal; they must be a Sensing Type”*, since Intuiting types can be prone to such behavior as well), resulting in a lower rating for a given person/type.  \n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nBe honest with yourself, even if this results in a rating that contradicts your initial beliefs/biases in the system; the truth is what matters the most in the end!  If you think you’d want help judging on what someone’s type may be in your life, I can try to help you out a little bit...  but, try to decide this for yourself/do good quality research and analyzing first! Some stereotypes that should be eliminated:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Not all Sensors are **poor at (or can't handle) abstract or philosophical conversations**, and not all Intuiting types are **unrealistic, impractical, and disconnected from reality**.  There is simply a preference for one or the other (and perhaps an imbalance in some)! And, on a related note, not all smart people are **Intuiting types**, and not all dumb people are **Sensing types** (or vice versa)!\n\n* Not all Feelers are **illogical and irrational**, and not all Thinkers are **cold and detached**.  For instance, being irrational can involve *absurd, inconsistent logic*, and sometimes being reasonable involves a **practical and fair** approach that requires *considering other people's feelings*.  A reasonable person will use both aspects to make sound, balanced decisions, but will typically prefer one over the other in a "tiebreaker" between the two. Not considering or actively disregarding one or the other is not superior in any way; this is just immaturity (in some regard) expressing itself!\n\n* Not all extroverts are **loud and obnoxious**, and not all introverts are **antisocial recluses that never talk**.  Being sociable isn't always the trait of an extrovert, and being socially anxious isn't always the trait of an introvert.  Also - some extroverts will not find conventional social affairs very energizing and stimulating; it can depend on the group of people for extroverts just as well as introverts.  Look into the cognitive functions!!! I cannot emphasize this enough.\n\n* Not all judging types are **overly rigid, rule abiding, and "stick up the ass" kinds**, and not all perceiving types are **chaotic, lackadaisical, and scatterbrained fools**.  We all have judging and perceiving functions, all of which can be prone to a form of narrow mindedness or disconnectedness.\n\n&nbsp; \n&nbsp; \n\nThe cognitive functions are supposed to educate us on how people introspect/reflect on things (introversion), and also how they interact with the environment (extroversion); how is a person interacting with their environment, and what kinds of biases do they try to mentally remove (introverted functions usually try to eliminate *environmental biases*, and extroverted functions usually try to eliminate *personal biases* in their respective domains)? \n\n&nbsp; \n&nbsp; \n\n*Remember: we're all going to have traits that are introverted, and some that are extroverted in their expression! It's a matter of which ones will be this way... this should also be used as a guide to eliminate any ambiguity with regard to this orientation (thus, people start believing they're an "ambivert" - a term I personally cannot agree with)*.\n\n&nbsp; \n\nIf your family members are being considered as one of your friends for this survey, that’s fine too; any relationship will do, provided that you know them on a personal basis (since strictly going off of someone’s “professional” face may be not only counterproductive for this survey, but detrimental in your personal relationship(s) with that person[s] ).\n\n&nbsp; \n&nbsp;\n\n**Socionics Users:** \n\nRemember to convert j→P and p→J for Introverts.  All of the data pertaining to the intertype relationships have already been converted to the MBTI system. For convenience, the system equivalents are placed below!\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**The NTs:**\n\nMBTI | Socionics | Sociotype\n---|---|----\nINTJ | INTp | ILI\nENTJ | ENTj | LIE\nINTP | INTj | LII\nENTP | ENTp | ILE\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The SFs:**\n\nMBTI | Socionics | Sociotype\n---|---|----\nESFP | ESFp | SEE\nISFP | ISFj | ESI\nESFJ | ESFj | ESE\nISFJ | ISFp | SEI\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The NFs:**\n\nMBTI | Socionics | Sociotype\n---|---|----\nINFJ | INFp | IEI\nENFJ | ENFj | EIE\nINFP | INFj | EII\nENFP | ENFp | IEE\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The SPs:**\n\nMBTI | Socionics | Sociotype\n---|---|----\nESTP | ESTp | SLE\nISTP | ISTj | LSI\nESTJ | ESTj | LSE\nISTJ | ISTp | SLI\n\n\n&nbsp; \n&nbsp;\n\n**Final Notes:**\n\nSome of the changes that we want to make aren’t yet implemented in the Google Sheets version - but hopefully this will change soon enough! Survey Participation, feedback/general commentary on the results, etc., are all highly sought after! We’d love to hear from you!\n\n&nbsp; \n&nbsp;\n\n**Current roles for this project:**\n\n/u/ashirviskas: the original survey developer and secondary google sheets maintenance\n\n/u/snugglybearsama: primary google sheets document 1-(wo)man maintenance crew (data organization, formatting, formula developer, etc.)\n\n/u/kun42: performed a wilson confidence interval on the survey data, and has a lot of statistical charts currently available on his blog for the survey data.  Check it out! https://www.man42.net/blog/2016/11/mbti-relationship-stats/\n\n&nbsp; \n&nbsp;\n\nIf you want to PM any of us regarding a given topic, use these roles as a general guide.  Currently, I’m the most active and involved of the three, so if you want to talk about other stuff with any of us, I'd be the most available!\n\n&nbsp; \n&nbsp;\n\n**EDIT:** If it matters (or anybody's curious)... I'm an ENTJ! Nice to meet you all :)
1	**3. Feedback Sought After**\n\nWe are currently (and very actively) looking for some feedback, including ideas/suggestions on new data points that are simply not listed or unintentionally omitted without an explanation, data points that could be compiled that aren’t (as of yet), etc. \n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Charts**\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is one of the main things that will need a good amount of time to implement.  There are plenty of charts found in the excel version that I have in my possession; however, Google Sheets didn’t render them properly (surprised? I’m not).  As a result, the entire charting process needs to be taken back to the drawing board… I had some really cool double-sided bar charts for male vs female comparisons made and everything.  What a shame!\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Mobile Users**\n\nAs of 1/4/2017, this document isn’t very mobile friendly; this file is TREMENDOUS.  There are a lot of calculations being done on this Google Sheets document (I mean, thousands of them on the “General, All Types” tab alone, not to mention the “individual type analysis” tab...). Eventually, I would like to make a more mobile friendly version of this, which would simply import a lot of the data instead of doing the calculations directly on the document (if that would make it faster… I’m no programming expert!)\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Sexual Orientation**\n\nAs of 1/1/2017, I haven’t really done much to perform calculations on the basis of sexual orientation.  This wasn’t a very high priority for me to be honest (my apologies), since I thought that for now, having the genders was sufficient.  The calculations required for this were attempted a while ago along with gender and types, but they became overwhelming and very intense, making the document nearly impossible to open and maintain.  \n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nI’m unfortunately not well versed in excel related things such as pivot tables, which would make this (along with other data points) much more attainable.  If anyone is able to create something like this for the survey data [or could share some really good pointers... does google sheets even have this feature?], that’d be splendid (and I’d love to learn)!\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Volunteers**\n\nFor the most part, I’ve been doing this stuff by myself (since /u/ashirviskas has a lot of school work, and /u/kun42 focused on doing statistics for his blog on this survey)… I’m sort of in over my head at this point, and I’ve slowed down on implementing the content we want on there considerably due to how overwhelming the work I’m assigning myself can be.  \n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nIf anyone wants to actively participate in making changes, suggestions, etc., I’m all for ideas and such! I would really like to work on getting well over 1,000+ (aspiring for over 2,000+... let me dream) responses on this survey (easily achieved), and implementing some charts.  I think there’s a lot of interesting data and insights that can be found in the results… I’d love to have someone to collaborate with on a regular basis about this stuff! I don’t bite, I promise… PM us if you’re interested (I know I am!).\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**EDIT:** The numbering was taken from a google sheets document (made sense on there)...
1	**2. Document Table of Contents/Structure**\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Survey Responses**\n\nThe raw survey responses - self-explanatory (hopefully!). Contains filters for the purposes of debugging, as well as examining data not organized into one of the other tabs of the document.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Overview (in the works as of 1/1/2017)**\n\nGives an overview of Gender, Type, Socionics, and Temperament survey results. Includes a vast majority of the charts on the document [charts not readily available on Google Sheets version - import from xlsx wasn’t so streamlined and nicely executed]. Compiles information from the “General, All Types”, “Gender”, and “Temperaments” Tabs, and presents them in paragraph format.\n   \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Introduction_References (in the works as of 10/25/2016)**\n\nGives a general overview of the concept of MBTI/Socionics (and will also give readers a general idea of the extent of knowledge/competence we the composers have), as well as explaining various things throughout the rest of the document.\n   \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**General, All Types**\n\nSummarizes survey data on the basis of individual type; mostly consists of semi-organized and compiled, yet unrefined data. Is used as a reference for other sheets, particularly the “In-Depth Analysis” and “Overview” Tabs.\n   \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Gender**\n\nSummarizes survey data on the basis of each gender for the types; consists of semi-organized and compiled, yet unrefined data.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n*NOTE: The issue of gender-type-relationship duration configurations was separated from “General, All Types” due to the calculation intensive output that would have occurred if each rater-type-gender-duration and ratee-type-gender-duration calculation was performed; this resulted in a table that was well over 15,000 rows long, and made the document excessively slow in a previous version (not to mention extremely cumbersome to navigate). Thus, the creation of the Gender Tab came into existence! We apologize if an intensive gender analysis is a highly sought after data point…*\n   \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n*NOTE 2: There is a gender assessment being worked on, and has been included in the “General, All Types” and “Overview” tabs…! Not yet implemented in the individual type analysis tab.*\n   \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Temperaments (in the works as of 10/25/2016)**\n\nSummarizes survey data on the basis of the various temperament groupings presented in the “Introduction_References” Tab.\n   \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Individual Type Analysis**\n\nSummarizes survey data on the basis of the individual type selected. Will be more type specific (and eventually more intensive as a result) than the data presented in the other tabs. \n   \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n*NOTE: This tab hasn’t been updated in awhile, but will eventually include a temperaments and gender based analysis such as what is found in the “Overview” Tab...!*\n   \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Socionics (NEW and in the works as of 12/27/2016)**\n\nOrganizes survey data on the basis of the socionics intertype dynamics. Gender based data is being worked on as well...!
1	**1. Data Point Values Sample List**\n\nSome of the data points we’ve put together and presented for you throughout the document (will apply to both friendships and romantic relationships) are as follows:\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**I. Individual Type Data Points**\n\n* Which type(s) give out the best ratings? The worst?\n* Which type(s) received the best ratings? The worst?\n* How frequently does your type date a given personality type? How does your type fare in the world of love?!\n* What is the relationship duration bracket distribution for each type?\n* Which type(s) make the best friends overall? The worst?\n* Which type(s) get along best with each other in their friendships? As a whole?\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**II. Gender Data Points**\n\n* What is the overall gender distribution for each type? Which gender/type dominates the participant pool?\n* Which type has the most dominant Male Population? Female? Other Genders?\n* What is the sexual preference distribution for each type? \n* Which gender rates their relationships the best?

The worst?\n* What is the relationship duration bracket distribution for each gender?\n* Which gender rates their friends in a more generous manner? [Reverse not available]\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**III. Temperament Data Points (this section is very heavily in the works as of 10/25/2016, and continuing as of 1/1/2016)** \n\n* What is the overall distribution of survey respondents when grouping the types by... \n 1. The Kiersey Temperaments (NF, NT, SJ, SP)? \n 2. The Perceiving Functions (NP, NJ, SJ, SP)? \n 3. The Judging Functions (FP, FJ, TJ, TP)? \n 4. Their Introversion/Extroversion Orientation/Preference (IP, IJ, EJ, EP)?\n\n* What is the overall distribution of the temperaments rated in their friendships and relationships (defined as “ratees”) *[NOTE: not a real word... oh well!]*?\n* Which Groupings have the best relationship compatibility with each other? \n* Which Grouping Method puts out the best results in terms of relationship compatibility?\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**IV. Socionics/Intertype Relationship Dynamics (NEW as of 12/27/2016)**\n\n* What is the most commonly relationship dynamic rated in the survey? Least Common?\n* What is the most highly rated relationship dynamic in the survey? Lowest?\n* How do the genders assign their relationships with the various intertype dynamics? How does gender play a role in these dynamics?\n
1	**ESTPs**: You're currently very grossly underrepresented in the survey data as of right now! We've only heard from 3 of you as of 1/4/2017... I'd like to hear more from the other side of the fence! I'd appreciate your candid feedback on your relationships with other types... the results are highly skewed as they stand.  Thanks again for stopping by! :)
1	Generally speaking, these are current distributions for the different temperaments for those who rated romantic relationships [as defined by MBTI). As you can see (as of 1/4/2017), some of them are grossly underrepresented (there seems to be some rounding errors/deviations here... keep that in mind)!\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Kiersey (NT, NF, SJ, SP):**\n\nNT | NF | SJ | SP\n---|---|----|----\n38.0% | 31.5% | 14.1% | 16.3%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Perceiving (NP, NJ, SJ, SP):**\n\nNP | NJ | SJ | SP\n---|---|----|----\n39.2% | 30.1% | 14.2% | 16.4%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Judging (FP, FJ, TJ, TP):**\n\nFP | FJ | TJ | TP\n---|---|----|----\n32.3% | 23.1% | 21.0% | 23.6%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**MBTI I/E**\n\nIP | IJ | EJ | EP\n---|---|----|----\n31.2% | 30.1% | 12.8% | 25.9%\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere's an exaggerated/skewed number of introverted intuitive types; we're attempting to collect more data on the types listed above! But, of course - all types are more than welcome to partake in the survey; we're just in high need of certain groups for a more fair representation!

12	[deleted]
11	His victory just makes a lot of sense. All the pc culture busting our asses and being butthurt for the past couple of years or so. So annoying,  I'm pretty sure all my fellow Estps see exactly what I'm talking about.\nRight now, we can't joke about anything anymore,  can't say anything anymore, the social justice warriors with high Fi will kick us in the nuts.\nMany American kind of felt that way... ---> Trump wins. \nHe's just smart for understanding those intricacies. \nThe only bad part for me, the butthurt infp/isfp still won't shut up!

9	What were you like as a teenager	
9	I'm almost 18, so I'll throw in a response to this. \n\nWhat am I like?\n\n-I take very few things in life seriously, aside from my health, what I like to do, and work.\n\n-Arguments make me laugh, and I rarely stress over school. \n\n-However, I am always the most responsible one in the group.\n\n-I'm quiet while I'm at school and work, but really outgoing anywhere else. I just don't think school or work is the place to be goofing around, I don't want to make my teacher's/manager's life any harder than it already is. \n\n-I party a lot because I really enjoy hanging out with my boys, and I like messing around with girls. \n\n-Relationships, anything long term scares me.\n\n-I have awful time management and procrastinate like hell sometimes when it comes to school stuff.\n\n-I'm really friendly, rarely ever get mad with people (I still get road rage and video game rage like everybody else). \n\n-As much as I love my parents, I want to move out more than anything in the world. I feel so restricted and held back by living with them. But, that's just too expensive to do nowadays.\n\n-I like playing sports for fun, I'm not that competitive.\n\n-Cities fascinate me, I'd love to live in one. there is so much going on, and so many people\n\n
2	Really really shy dude. Couldn't go to parties I was scared shitless.  Girls, forget about it, way too scared as well. I wouldn't do anything that could have compromise my comfort.\nEstps are little bitches growing up...\nUntil we discover our Se superpower ;) \nThen we explore a lot with it... Or not and we just develop a really good Ti. But to become healthy we need both, and since we tend to do one thing at the time, it's one then the other...\n
2	complete loser. more intelligent than average (was always in the top sets in school) and seemed to be more mature than my peers. but yeah, chubby and a loser. \n\nIts weird to think back to how I was seeing as I'm almost the complete opposite now. I started changing mentally when I left for Uni. 
2	Honestly, the whole thing was strange as I was very far from your typical teenager. As it turns out, I basically had a puberty pause from 16 to 21. So anyway, to answer your question.\n\n- I questioned all authority and especially religious authority, but I was never rebellious.\n- I have always operated outside of cliques which my area is full of even outside of the high school age group. As such, I've always been very fly solo yet wanted my own crew.\n- Had a period of a race identity questioning as I was the only Hispanic in the area and I didn't look Hispanic to anyone. Got over it during college.\n- Always acted on my best behavior and was always incredibly scared to break any rules.\n- Was one of the smaller ones build wise yet somehow solid. Cue puberty part 2 where I'm huge.\n- I only went to one party and was flat out shocked and bored by all the teenagers drinking with their parents present.\n- I was never invited to anything.\n- I was, for a lack of better words, eccentric. Some joked I was most likely to shoot up the school. \n\nCompared to now, at the age of 26, some things are still the same, but I'm much more confrontational with authority and more actively seek to dominate. I'd say a lot of my personality was there back then, but it didn't show up often because I repressed a lot of it.
2	Just commented on a separate post in this sub but the story applies here as well:\n\nI went to a private school with a strict dress code. On days following report cards, we would get a "dress down" day (basically we could wear jeans) if we had a parent's signature on our report card.\n\nWhile this thrilled all of my classmates, I didn't like the idea of this reward system (it felt like giving a rat a piece of cheese for following a maze). Even though I got straight A's, I wouldn't get my parent's signature and would show up to school in full dress code. I would get off to the fact that I wasn't breaking any rules while still sticking it to school that they couldn't control me with rewards.\n\nTL;DR: I was a very angsty teenager

1	I work in a warehouse job that I really hate because it's the same shit everyday. If I didn't get to move around all day (I walk an average of 10-12 miles a day at work) I would seriously have to quit immediately. But I'm always late, I kind of do my own thing there and my manager just kind of lets me do whatever. It's weird but whatever. I also have two businesses I do after work and on the weekends that makes me way more money than my actual day job does. I also train Muay Thai some nights a week and produce music as a hobby. 
1	I manage the counties landfills, I have an engineering degree, which was hard to get through, but seemed the most logical degree for me. I hate my job, for the most part, lots of stupid rules, horrible bureaucracy, and I work for people I don't respect. The good things about the job: somewhat autonomous, buying expensive equipment, lots of little things to learn about, and landfills are quite the necessity. \n\nI'm always wishing for a different job. For me the optimal job would be something that would allow me to learn something new on a regular basis, was rarely repetitive and required a lot of problem solving and hands on work. \n\nIn my free time I rock climb, mtn bike, snowboard, fly fish, roast coffee and like to pick up new useful skills if I need them for a project. 
9	What do you all think about INTP's?	ISTP here, doing a study for my fellow INTP's. \n\nEDIT: Thought I was an INTP, but after doing more research I know for a fact that I am an ISTP.

3	i know an intp. he's an absent minded idiot, and i hate him just for that
3	INTPs are really self assured in my opinion and ready to learn. Which I totally respect. I think they're really intelligent in their own respect if they're passionate about something but they're not big on give or take, it's usually just take. Loveable assholes.
2	I haven't known any INTPs well enough to make an accurate judgement. They are a rather uncommon type.
4	Thoughts on INFPs?	For a study being conducted by yours truly.
3	Complex people!
1	Just in case none of the ESTPs says it: We INFPs are awesome ;)
3	What do you think of INTP and INTJ	
5	INTPs are often some of the most fascinating people to me. My crush for years growing up was an INTP and I'm currently dating an INTP and he's the only person who I've been able to actually love as an ESTP. I think INTPs are very raw about who they are and from my experience show very little interest in anything unless it's beneficial to them. Because INTPs are more insensitive and open about the truth but not flashy about it, this similar trait attracts me to them. Their reluctancy to reciprocate or develop acts of kindness, which comes so easily to me (and from what I understand other ESTPs) causes a lot of issues in our relationship because I feel like I put in so much effort while I have to convince my s/o to do something because it'll be in his favor for one reason or the other. Outside of how real they are, when an INTP cares about you or is interested, you can tell. for me, I'm really good at a lot of things and really interested in a lot of things but I wouldn't say I'm a master of anything. INTPs on the other hand pinpoint things their interested in and they learn all about it and dedicate time and passion until they master it. A trait I think is over looked that I've seen in four INTPs. That's another reason they're so attractive to me.\n\nTwo of my closest friends are INTJs. One of which is assertive, the other, very turbulent. Until I met them I had no idea what an impact these descriptors had on someone. They both seek a sense of validation from authority figures and their shared unwillingness to take risks and make quick calculations is something I had to get used to. My assertive friend, lets call her A, is confident and comfortable with herself. Although she's aware of her imperfections and mistakes she takes them in stride. A is anything but a show off. A comfortable person who enjoys learning. She can be overbearing, but I admire her to an extent. My turbulent friend, T, really tries to be comfortable because he, like A, is self aware but T realizes that his discomfort is showing and that is what sets him off balance with A. T tries very hard to fit into other types and develop traits that aren't his that emulate someone that he thinks looks comfortable. This made him develop a lying problem that drove people away and made him seem cocky and self centered and self righteous. The INTJ that people complain about online. But once he met A through me, T saw himself in her and he's been getting comfortable with who he really is. I would say INTJs for me are a coin toss either great or terrible.  
1	Annoying in a sense. I can't fathom how you can be that involved in emotions and other people and feelings and looking into things in depth and creativity, etc. \n\nIt's like a "can't be bothered" kind of thing. That being said, my SO is either INTJ or INFJ, so I guess that's just a case of opposites attracting because we click damn near perfectly
6	Life in Minnesota as an ESTP	Y'all. I live in one of these places where everyone hangs out with the folks they went to Kindergarten with and don't communicate with strangers or in the workplace etc., and as a fresh transplant from the hyper-social south, I'm totally lost. Anyone live in a place that's super, super antisocial yet feed entirely off of human interaction and conversation and banter?\n\nHow do you do it without putting a bullet between your eyes?
2	man I feel your pain. I lived in Vanouver for a little while and holy shit the clique culture is retarded. I blew that popsicle stand and moved. Couldn't stand it. I cant be much help I'm afraid.
1	Im an INFP. I moved from Florida to Michigan, in college... I swear people would clutch the walls and slink away just from me saying Hi. Like no one had ever just said "Hi" before!?!?? I eventually made friends with expats. We ate dinner at each other's houses every night of the week. 20 people. A different culture and meal almost every damn night. Fuck the social retards.\n\nIt's been almost 15 years, and I'm still friends with those people!\n\nI moved back home, moved away and went back home again more than a handful of times. I've lived in 11 different states. I always made good, deep, fast friends. But not in effing Michigan. I went to mass daily, went on retreats, threw myself out there... it took six months for me to meet one really awesome Jamaican chick. \n\nGood luck!!!\n\nI can only imagine how frustrating that must be for an ESTP.
1	Hyper social? That's kind of strange to me as I live in the New Orleans area and what you described in Minnesota is just that here.
4	ESTP shadow function	When you get stressed, tired, overwhelmed, or depressed, what happens?  What behaviors do you exhibit? Where does your mind start focusing on? What gets you back to yourself or how do you re-energize? \n
6	I get way into myself and start navel-gazing and catastrophizing. I already have an anxiety disorder, but stress pushes it into the stratosphere.\n\nI become myopic, I lose motivation, I can't/won't/don't *do* anything,  I think the (my) world's gonna end, I project way too far into the future and lose grounding, I dissociate. I fizzle out and lose my enthusiasm. My fuse shortens to about half an inch and I go from laid-back to asshole. When I'm in the shithole of my anxiety, I lose focus and can't pinpoint causes, and thus can't do anything about the problem.\n\nIt's paralysis.\n\nI usually have to ground and yank my ass back into the present, even just by distracting myself, until I'm in a better place to face my demons head on and pick them apart to do something about them. 
6	Usually, being depressed in general means being stuck into an Ti-Ni loop. In this loop you just come back again and again on a single issue trying to rack your head around it to find a solution. But no matter how hard you try, it just seems to have none. Therefore, I'm just paralysed, I don't sleep anymore, I don't want to party, when I talk to people they can feel that I don't care at all about them...\nSo it's overall pretty bad, when we go in a bad place we lose all our light... \nThe best way I've found to go over that is to get in touch with our Fi. As crazy as it sounds. \nI would recommend "the Power of Now: a Guide to spiritual Enlightement" by Eckart Tolle, and (the best one) "Letting go, a Pathway to surrender" by David Hawkins.\nBasically, understanding your feeling and facing them, embracing your darkness to be able to consciously letting go of it...
5	I get really sad and unmotivated to follow through my daily routine that I'm otherwise excited for like going to the gym, studying a bit, or helping my parents or s/o out. I like the sense of accomplishment. Sometimes I develop reckless behaviors and get pugnacious over nothing. Just talking to me sets me off the rails. I'm aware that the person doesn't deserve it, but I speak before I think when I'm like this and then I feel bad about lashing out, and get back into a cycle. I focus on myself and missed opportunities. I re-energize by reading, being around positive (and patient) people, and setting new goals for self improvement, like making a to do list. Without fail these things get me up and running especially being around positive people. I want to contribute to the joy. The to do list helps me organize an overwhelmed schedule and reading gives me a chance to put my mind on something other than myself. 
3	Basically it sounds like the state that INFJs are in 95% of the time, minus the depression.
2	I'm an INFP dating an ESTP, and I actually came here for this exact answer.\n\nI am pulling out of temporary PTSD. A feeler with irrational feels. My ESTP boyfriend was in his own personal hell, I'm sure. But he held me together, and fell apart once I got better!  Which is where we've been lately. I came here to ask this exact question for these exact reason. \n\nI can tell you what it looks like from my perspective... not sure if that would help. 
2	He's one of the most selfless, loyal, giving, loving, men I have ever met in my entire life! And he doesn't see that in himself right now. He's not himself. It is so freaking painful to watch.
2	S's: Have you ever cheated?	I'm [ENTP] part of the Intuitive Integration [INTJ, INFJ, ENTP, ENFP] page on Facebook. Recently, someone posted, asking if anyone has ever cheated. I was wondering whether the answers would changed, based on someone's N or S function. She here are the questions that were asked:\nDid you ever cheat on your partner? If yes, how does it feel the moment you actually let someone start to undress you? Update: Guilt / no guilt? Can you actually really completely enjoy it?
5	Wow. This seems really insulting.\n(I'm an INFP)\nS's aren't heartless sex fiends. If they aren't into you, they aren't into you. If they're up for a good time, and you are too, why not? But "I do" means "I do"\n\nWe all want the same thing. A deep meaningful connection intellectually, physically, spiritually, and emotionally. And compatible  life goals and morals, I'm sure. If you don't have those things, what's the point? I would imagine that if there is a "type" that would be cool with an open relationship, S's might MIGHT fall into that. But they value loyalty. \n\nPeriod.\n\nI can't imagine ever cheating. I'd rather just be alone. I imagine that S's would too. You can do whatever you want when you're alone. If other people are up for it. Makes sense to me. And I'd never be into that, personally. But I can see it.\n\nYou might as well be asking if there are any existing S virgins. IMO.\n\nThat moment of undress... that's too personal.\n\nThis coming from a chick that has interesting conversations about her boyfriends testicles. Hahahaha!!!\n\nI love that moment of undress with him.\nI'm positive it would hurt for him to go there with someone else. There's no way. 
4	I know this is old but whatever\n\nI've come close, definitely walked the line. I slept with another girl like three days before entering a serious relationship. I've done that several times actually\n\nIf it wasn't for my undying loyalty and love for my current significant other, there's been some times where I'd say no but definitely have to remind myself it's not worth throwing away what I have. \n\nReally, if I were to cheat, I'd break up with whoever I was with that day or the following. I'd be honest about it though and own it

2	What is for you the greatest invention of the 20th century?	"Various opinion polls have shown that the greatest invention of the twentieth century the invention of the pill, because people can love when they pleased, because women no longer fear that they will become pregnant. Wonder tablet have brought sexual and indirectly, economic independence, so they can compete for better jobs and no longer fainted when they saw a mouse - were no longer dependent on male stereotypes about women. Thanks to contraception have entered into a contractual relationship. The emancipation of women is actually a paradox of imparting a freedom because women requires more and more responsibilities and duties. What they once represented as a great social achievement and privilege today they are experiencing as a form of oppression."

1	INFP with PTSD dating ESTP	Hi,\nI was recently diagnosed with TEMPORARY PTSD. Which is good that there's an end, but I'm having a hard time with it. My ESTP boyfriend is amazing. He's been here, physically, with me, the whole time. I swear. He's outright asked for two days alone in the last year. We don't live together, but we might as well.\n\nMy question is this. When I'm in an "episode" or feeling over emotive, the last thing I CAN do is verbalized it.\n\nHe's been saying lately that he feels like he's losing me. I feel like I'm inadvertently driving him out. My love language is physical. I could be on him all day. We have loads of sex. But his is verbal. And he always wants to "check in" and I still can't verbalized what's going on. I can give him metaphors.... and that's driving him crazy. Which is all I can do, right now.\n\nWhen I can detach and make it "this happened, then that, so it seems to me blah blah blah" he's receptive. And he gets emotional. And then I don't know what to do.\n\nI don't know what I'm asking. Except that he's so strong and insightful. I love him fiercely. But do any of you have experience in this? Is there a support resource that I can point him to? I got him to take the MBTI. But talking to him about it is making him crazy. And, actually, outward over emoting is not okay for me. I'm phlegmatic/sanguine. I love to connect and be social! I feel bad that he's so down about this that I can't get him up and out for anything. He's lost his motivation, and me being playful and trying to get him to perk up seem counter-intuitive. Plus it's not working anymore. He seems more depressed than I am. \n\nI'm not driving him crazy. The over analytical, non-personal, metaphorical, explaining is driving him crazy.\n\nIs there a resource? Some "support your over emotive girlfriend" group?\n\nPlease?\n\nThis is my first time using Reddit! I don't know how to respond to people! This thing jumps all over the map!
5	The harsh relationship between ESTP and Fi, here we gooooo...\nAs you probably know, Fi is one of our weakest functions by far, not only it is subconscious, but we have a weird love-hate relationship with it.\nThe way I can put it, is that our Fi is so immature that it has a all or nothing relationship to it.\nEither we would feel a lot and be overwhelmed even if it rarely happens, or we would just be in our usual state of pushing boundaries and not feeling or being empathetic to the others.\nIt's not that we don't want to understand the others, especially when we care about them, which is clearly the case in your story.\nThe problem is that we are just unable to feel the others most of the time.\nIf your boyfriend realises that something is wrong emotionally speaking, it's a freaking huge step already!\n\nYou NEED to give him clues and insights, verbally, and try to make it sound simple, even if it's super nuanced.\nWe ESTPs HATE nuances, we understand the small nuances once we are more developped but in order to grasp a concept or even an emotion, we need SIMPLE WORDS.\n\nI hope that it can help your situation, sorry but in this case he made the first step towards you which is trying to understand by listening. You made an ESTP give up on his own reality to connect to you, and this is beautiful! So, do your part of the deal now and put your emotions into words, easy words, basic emotions. His Ti will do the rest of the work, all he needs is the starting point.\n\nSome stuffs like: I'm feeling frustrated by this situation because... I'm fearing that... I am angry at... I am sad because...\n\n(All of this requires trumendous efforts on his part so if he gets the emotions wrong cut him some slack, the fact that he is trying means A LOT)
2	Fe users need to see emotions being resolved.  He might feel like he is unable to make you feel better since your emotions are more internal and brooding Fi.  From what I've found INFP's have a really difficult time with Se-Fe users like ESTP/ISTP They need concrete reasons and ways of changing for the better.  Abstract ambiguous internal feelings will definitely start to corrode them over time until they feel useless and mostly they just want you to show happiness and be external.  Which you can't since you're an infp.  I predict hard times to come :(
1	Okay. That was in my language. Which I thought was simple. I want to be sure I understand this. So my reply to you:\n\nThank you for the advice! I got to put this into action and I appreciate the distinction of acknowledging things upfront. It has literally eliminated my need to ruminate and then share my feelings. I have personally had an excellent day because of this.\n\nI appreciate that a lot.
1	Okay. I'm also going to go ahead and admit that my lack of eloquence in comparison to your thorough and thoughtful response makes me feel like Spock.\n\nI sucked out all the love.\n\nBut I don't know you well enough to snuggle up and connect. So I apologize for that as well 😚\n\nI am very appreciative ❤️
1	Let me know if you want to know how life feels like a game of golf in 3,000 words. That was me simplifying how I felt! Hahahaha!\n\nOh this poor man. I can't wait to see how this changes things. It's such a damn relief. 
1	There have been others.... I hear stories.... 🤓\n\n\nI'm glad I don't know what the naysayers have against us as a pair.
1	Okay, being curious as hell, I looked up socionics. That's some messed up dysfunctional spiral they have painted there.\nIf I understand correctly, aren't we a dual pair? It will go amazingly well or plummet into a a flaming vortex of pain.\n\nI'm Pisces and he's a Gemini 🙄\n\nWell. If he can get over walking on eggshells and blurt out whatever it is that's making him upset, I keep telling him I'm good after the initial blow to my ego.\nHe's afraid of hurting me.\nNot letting me in is hurting me.\nHearing I'm doing something wrong will only hurt because I don't want to mess up. It won't hurt my feelings. INFP are emotional. Not illogical. We are definitely reasonable.\n\nI don't see how it won't work.\n\nWe have to be honest. Period.\n\n...right?\n\nDammit! I want to wrestle it out and not deal with the bullshit!
1	You know what. I feel like I really know how I want to handle things in the moment. I feel like I can absolutely tell him what's going on with me right now. I feel like that eliminates the need to over think or get feely over shit.\n\nBring it on. \n\nIn a warm fuzzy way! Because I love your face off!!!\n\nThanks for the help!
1	I love you guys so much, right now!!!\n\n❤️️😍😘
7	Do you guys talk yourself out of stuff?	I have never gotten a ticket but have been pulled over like seven or eight times. Never really get in trouble at school or work even when I definitely did something wrong. \n\nRelatable?\n\n\n\nEdit: what about bullshitting your way through things? I'm also very good at that, is it an ESTP trait?

3	Just so y'all know if you try this with an ISTP chances are they aren't going to be as easily fooled, lol 
2	[deleted]
2	I can make up the most believable lies. More of a social manipulator than to do it for my own benefit/compulsive liar. The lack of consequence is probably from the fast thinking and being charasmatic? We can make people empathise with us I suppose? Someone with better knowledge could probably analyse.
1	All the fucking time
1	Talked my way out of expulsion multiple times from highschool to uni. Saved others in the process twice.
1	I bullshit my way through anything I don't understand. It works, too.
1	All the time, especially when people start to get butthurt!
1	In retrospect, yeah, maybe. I haven't thought about it much before since it was all automatic, but it *could* be attributed to luck or charisma.\n\nI'm thinking mostly of grade school and the fact that, in present day, my 'good personality' gets me out of a *lot* of hot water. I have trouble believing it at times, but I'm apparently likable (as I've been told, anyway) enough to be able to squeak my way out of a lot of things, or just 'lucky' enough to be able to squeeze by.\n\nThat's going by others' reports, though, because I just kind of act and do and other people report it to me later on, because I don't put too much stock into my charisma since I'm too busy focusing on other things.\n\nI also wing it a lot based on context, and things tend to go in my direction (and if they don't, that's fine!).\n\nI'd say that being called a "bullshitter" is not at all inaccurate lmao
1	I rarely find myself in those situations. If I do, I will either take the loss and be honest about the fact that I've made a mistake, or I will try to be real sly and get myself out of a bad situation by acting real innocent. If I can, I'll try to be real subtle about it too.\n\nIt usually works, and if it doesn't, I can at least turn a real shitty situation into a much-less shitty situation.
2	Do you guys like owning things?	I have this ESTP friend who plays LoL with me and he kept buying new champions before using them even if they're free to test for a week. When I asked him why he doesn't like playing things before buying them he couldn't really put it into words and said that he was a 'possessive man'. I wouldn't expect him to be irresponsible with real money as this is just in-game currency, though.\n\nDo you guys relate to this in any way?
4	Yup. Impulse buying, but that's more of impulsiveness than anything else
2	Yes. Absolutely. 100%. I did the exact same thing when i played LoL. \n\nI also spent a fair share of real money, but certainly not more than i could afford
1	Guilty of impulse buying lootboxes (mainly seasonal ones) in Overwatch myself. Trying to practice self discipline.
4	What do you think about ENTJ's?	As an ENTJ woman, I absolutely adore ESTP'S.
3	They're great!
2	ESTP and ENFJ are supposedly in what's called ["benefit" relations](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Benefit) in socionics where ENTJ is benefactor to ESTP. It's attractive for both types and great for friendship, but relationships between two logical extroverts can get too one-sided and complicated due to deficiency of feeling.
1	My sister-in-law is an ENTJ and we get along great. I really admire her focus and ambition. 
1	Amazing, trustworthy, strong. Trump taught me to love ENTJ.
2	Opinion on INFPs	Please share your experiences good/bad if you have any. \n\n\n\nMany thanks in advance my ESTP brothers and sisters. \n\n\n\nMuch love. 
3	Married one and absolutely adore her. Been marry to her for almost 10 years and don't regret it at all. She is very silly and loving and makes me think of things differently than I would have had. She has made me a little more open-minded about things that don't have hard facts attached to them. If you have anymore questions you would like to ask me feel free to ask.
5	I posted this in the ENTP thread not long ago. I'll re-post it here for you.\n\nI recently had a rather negative experience with an INFP girl. Very privileged upbringing. Only child. She was "caged" by her parents as she described it. International student new to the US. Extremely fascinated by the depth of her own Fi. Highly self-absorbed. Definitely very entitled and a tad narcissistic. Basically she used me as a sounding board because I'm a pretty receptive guy. Our conversations were 90% about her: her feelings, struggles, aspirations, etc. Maybe only 10% was about me or topics of mutual interest. I should have put a stop to it earlier, but I thought to myself that INFPs were very sensitive creatures and setting her straight would have caused too much damage. I drove her around to a few places and did some nice things for her over the course of a few weeks. Never once did I get a "thank you" for my efforts. I actually had to remind her to say that. Turns out I'm the one who got hurt. She was just using me as a blank canvas. The conversations we had were her art. She didn't care about me as a person at all; the respect wasn't there. So I cut all ties with her. I think it's for the best.\n\nI have concluded from this experience that INFPs absolutely must, must, must have a creative outlet and/or be of service to others. Otherwise the Fi builds up this incredible reservoir of feeling that completely crowds out everything else, including space for other people and even empathy itself. Seems hard to believe that a dominant feeler could lack empathy, but actually they're no more or less empathetic than thinkers as it turns out. Kind of like how ENTPs go antisocial if they don't have enough stimulation or variety or aren't taking in new information and letting their Ne roam free, INFPs without an artistic outlet ultimately become self-absorbed, uncaring, manipulative, and tyrannical, not to mention the usual inferior Te of maintaining false beliefs in the face of contradictory facts and evidence.\n\nFor the record, she took the MBTI and always got either INFP or INFJ, but I had her take another type test and we ended up figuring out she was an Fi dominant. [We looked at this video together.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JR3_OtpJe8) She identified very strongly with Andrew Garfield and stated emphatically, "fuck Carey Mulligan."
2	Absolutely excellent. Above all the competition. Way more intelligent than ESTPs, however difficult that is. Sexy as anything. Just, all round most excellent.\n\nOh sorry...you wanted ESTPs to comment...\n\nxD\n\n(hi btw ;P)
1	Most of my experiences have been with unhealthy INFPs, so I don't think I can give an unbiased answer here
1	I have an INFP sister as well as numerous INFP friends. My INFP connections always show me cool new music and TV shows, they are very authentic and loyal when they decided that you are worthy of their friendship.\n\nIt's kinda annoying when I'll try to get you guys to actually do something rather than talk about things and idea's tho. We will definitely try to make enjoy things that seem thrilling to us,  and completely stupid to you.\n\nTo conclude, you guys are pretty cool, and it's really fun to stress you out by doing something we shouldn't.\n\nSincerely, a narcissistic ESTP.

4	What do you guys think of yourself?	Like really.
8	I need people to be sane, but they have to be the right sort of people. A Jolly stranger is sometimes better for me than a miserable friend. \n\nI do try to do the right thing for others, but I do have a core of selfishness that I will pull my kids into and lock the door when things get to much and the world gets too needy. I have a need to help others but if they won't help themselves they irritate and exhaust me.
3	I know that I'm awesome. I have people frequently telling me that I'm 'one of a kind'. People are drawn to me because I'm fun to be around and I'll always find something exciting to do. I don't act in any sort of cocky manner, but knowing that I'm fun, intelligent, and on top of that, beautiful, means I won't stick around for someone that isn't worth my time. \n\n
1	Since I struggle with depression and anxiety, I vacillate between "you suck major anal prolapse" and "yeah, I'm pretty damn great"
2	MBTI and Video Game Preferences	I was wanting to map video game preference to the MBTI, specifically to the eight Jungian functions. Anyone have any thoughts on that?
6	As an ESTP, I like shooters, I like the fast paced and competitive side (much like all my ESTPs colleagues here). \nBut my preferred type is RPG- action adventure, like Skyrim, the Witcher, Fallout. I like them because I don't get bored. The storyline is deep, the gameplay is fun, you have the freedom to do (almost) what you want. \n \nI feel like with other games even with shooters sometimes I get bored super easily. I buy them, play them intensely for a few days and get bored once I've tried all gameplay loop and mechanism. \nI need something exciting and new all the time otherwise I drop it fast and move on 
2	As an ESTP I like to play competitive shooters so I can compare my skill rating with others (shooters have shorter games than moba so it will take less time from my life). Also base building games where I can make own systems and structures. And some timekiller browser based games which have achievements so I feel great after achieving those. And of course big AAA games like GTA, Witcher etc when I have free days.\n\nAs far as I have seen similar threads, where people study game preferences, there is always all the games featured. Every people play different styles on different days and moods.\n\nThe real question you want to ask is something like this: "Describe what video games do you play. Why and when do you play those?"
2	my biggest time sink was borderlands 2, that was like crack to me. Also a big fan of Overwatch and call of duty. I never bothered with the story I just enjoy killing people. \n\nso yeah, +1 for shooters here as well.
2	Once I find a game I really like I binge until there's nothing left of interest to me, on the flip side an INFP friend of mine likes mixing and matching the games he plays on a regular basis. Maybe there is a correlation?
1	Idk what the jungian functions are, but, as an estp, i only play fast pace competitive games
1	Shooters is all I ever play, everything else just becomes boring after a week or so.
1	I get motion sickness, so shooters aren't really an option for me. My go to games are usually 4X. 
1	4X. Strategy, management, tycoon. micro management -> macro management. A process of advancement is visible.\n\nI'll binge play a game for a period then not touch it for months.
1	Action, fighting, RPG, adventure, visual novel, and recently FPS with Overwatch, but I wouldn't consider that your typical FPS.\n\nI've taken a break from tournament play due to personal life and just not enjoying the local toxicity.
1	I play a variety of video games and have been for years. Mostly fps, MOBA, and rpg's 
1	Any type of horror game. Shooters, puzzle, whatevs.

7	Do ESTPs do things while watching TV in the background?	I'm wondering if ESTPs (or Se high stack) would watch a tv show (or stream, whatever you're into) at the same time as reading, writing or performing some other task that requires a pretty high level of focus.\n\nI'd like to know if you do watch something while doing other tasks how well do you pay attention to it?
10	Yes. But then I end up missing half the show. So I only do it with things I'm not very invested in. 
5	I used to really focus on the show, but lately when I'm on the couch i'll surf facebook/reddit etc, unless the show is really engaging.\n
4	So like... your question phrases it the wrong way round i think. Instead of multi tasking it's filling the gaps in the main activity.\n\nLet me put it like this. The tv noise fills in the gaps between the times when i'm focusing on the actual thing i'm doing. So i might put it there for downtime - in between moments. Or just to look at while i rest my eyes. Literally a brief distraction. I wouldn't consider myself able to tell you what was going on in the show - unless i've seen it before.\n\nI sometimes put on a video to fall asleep (better than lying there bored).\n\nThere are also plenty of things that you can watch and ignore until the bits you like are arriving.\n\nIf i *have* to rewatch something because there's not much new to watch then i could get bored and start reading the web while having moved the video to the side.\n\nHave you ever watched something absentmindedly and only really tuned your real attention into it for the bits you like?
3	I'd rather focus on one thing and take it all in.
1	I generally don't like it being extremely quiet and still so I need something to keep my nerves down when I have to do school work. Even in class I have to get up at least once a lecture. Doesn't help I hate the material.\n\nAnyway, outside of school, it depends. If I'm in crunch time where I need to study something, I try to cutoff all external stimuli like TV and music. If it's something physical, I need noise to keep the mind and body stimulated.
1	I literally do this all the time with the same 5-6 shows I cycle through. 
3	ESTP men: when are the times you feel competitive with women?	Do you resist your competitive urges or do you give into ego? Please provide details. 
7	[deleted]  \n ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.1579 \n > [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/09931)
2	> Do you resist your competitive urges\n\nNo. Why should i? Any competition is a game. ESTPs like to play and competition is exciting. Also how do you expect me to make an impression without a challenge?\n\nActually i'm kinda fussy about who i will play with. Not all adults are good at playing! And people can sometimes be very bad at sharing their toys in adulthood! That may even turn into the challenge "how to get this person to share their toys with me". I've certainly felt that a few times :D\n\nWhat are we in competition over? **If it's a competition to impress each other than i would call that flirting.**\n\nThere is no desire to "win" at flirting. But an arrogant personality might not be able to accept defeat. This is not a hallmark of ESTP.\n\nESTP doesn't care about losing so long as we played well.\n\n> do you give into ego\n\nYes. But it's not like i "give in"... why would i resist my ego?\n\nI will show off if i can make it amusing to do so. Bragging would typically be a male vs male thing but i'll brag to a lady if we are friendly enough. Ultimately engaging in competition is showing the other person that they are viewed as an equal.\n\nOther things that satisfy my ego are good sportsmanship; Complementing a victor. Learning how to improve.\n\nESTP can be egotistical;\n\n> 1) one who has become so ultimately consumed by their ego, that their entire view of the world and everyone in it is twisted. They usually perceive themselves as 'God's Gift to Women (mayhaps Men ...)' or are just plain sick as well as cocky.\n\n> 2) A person whose ego exceeds both his intelligence and his capacity to see beyond his own personal interests.\n\n> 3) A self-absorbed waste of oxygen who expects us to grovel at their feet like the unwashed masses they see us as\n\n> 4) Someone who talks just to hear themselves (because no-one else will listen)\n\n> 5) being egoist, is loving, respecting and admiring yourself more than any other being in the World. when you simply think, you're the best.\nin better words: your egoist when you start feeling sorry for someone because you don't love him/her:) \n\nBut this is not a defining characteristic of the type.\n\n---\n\nConcrete example of competitiveness between male (ESTP) and female (????); "i can drink more than you"... "no you can't i'll drink you under the table"... proceed to get heavily drunk and decide that both are winners.
1	Whenever a woman is better than me in pretty much anything. Except if it's a particularly feminine thing.

3	ESTP and INTP what do you thing of such combination?	... isn't it explosive after all? Both are logical thinking observers but when it comes to commitment the first one avoid it for any price, but the second one could forsake his own for her for the price of eternity. They share same purpose but divided by life coincidence - they have met in wrong time. When one is ready to be engaged and after it to be married and the other one believes that it will not become as a truth and if it will it won't take long time for ESTP for escape the cage. My question here: Is there even the slightest possibility for female ESTP to understand what INTP could give her for her everlasting companionship. And it must to be mentioned that INTP's aren't the one's that easily give trust and commitment (if they ever...) but if they do, rather hell freeze over then they change theirs mind. 
3	I don't see any problem with this combination. \n\n> Is there even the slightest possibility for female ESTP to understand what INTP could give her for her everlasting companionship.\n\nI'm an ESTP male. If i can understand it then i'm sure you can work out what your INTP has got going on.\n\nBut the reason i say that is because you are compatible. And after compatible communication it only really matters about the aspects that MBTI doesn't address.\n\nPersonal life experiences are the things that keep us together.\n\nEspecially for ESTP. You will be happy if you are enabled to do the things that you want in life. If the INTP holds you back then it won't work. However there's no particular reason why the INTP would hold you back... you would likely be leading them forwards and they will willingly follow.\n\nBut this can complicate the male and female sex roles. In other words the INTP male must be able to wear the pants on particular subjects - whatever matters to the INTP. If not the ESTP female will not respect his ability to protect and provide for her (the male has not demonstrated sufficient conviction for his responsibility to himself).\n\nESTPs are sensitive to "turf" but the INTP is not. So there can easily be complications in this area.\n\nThese male and female sex roles are basic instinct  - it can even get in the way of a good mesh in personality. This can be the difference between good friends and good lovers.\n\nBut it shouldn't be a problem if you are aware if it. And if you feel like your guy is a bit weak or you are not too excited about the long term benefits then i would assume your sex roles have become muddled.\n\nThe INTP should seek to improve. I would recommend that he start doing press ups because then you'll still find him an attractive companion for the long term.

1	You read too much into personality predictions. Rarely does a person fit so perfectly into a category, so don't worry too much about it. People have their own nuances and their distinct personalities. Relax and interact, then make your own judgements from there 
1	No. If you talk like you just made your post it won't work out. ESTPs do and are active and in their down time or brief instances of reflection they'd rather work on the emotional rather than an analytical point of view. \n\nSeems like nothing romantic has started yet, I mean to let you know women kinda know if some guy is trying to work them especially if she's over the age of 25.\n\n(INFP)
1	I have a couple of ESTP female acquaintances and they like men who aren't predictable and introverted. They like nonstop excitement and men who are alpha male types. For an INTP to play this role, it would be very difficult and exhausting for you. \n\nDo you just like the ESTP for her looks, or can you actually engage in conversation with her? 
1	I'm an INTP. I have an ESTP friend.\n\nFriends are fine. If the ESTP is careful.\n\nNot only are INTPs pretty much entirely incapable of fulfilling the relationship needs of ESTPs, the kind of pressure an ESTP will apply in response is the kind of thing that will break an INTP.\n\nESTPs will not understand why the INTP can't do the thing. And they won't be careful about offering correction if you don't maintain psychological and emotional distance.\n\nThe ESTP will end up disappointed and the INTP will end up in therapy.
1	I am working my charm on a female INTP so thanks for the insight.
3	How to play it with an ESTP dude?	Alright. This sub seems a little less active than the other MBTI subs so I'm crossing my fingers that I get some responses. For context I'm proooobably an ENTP or an INTP.\n\nI've known this ESTP since high school, but we hadn't really seen each other since 2007. Every few years he hits me up to flirt with me and test the waters to see if I'll have sex with him. Usually it hasn't worked out for one reason or the other. \n\nThis last time I happened to be single and we got to talking. He stood me up a couple months ago and I was pretty meh about bothering to try and meet up again. Then a few weeks ago he started snap chatting me pretty much every day. I got a little fed up with him beating around the bush and was finally like "We fucking or not?"\n\nSo that happened last Wednesday. I know some ISTPs pretty well so I went the route of giving him food and fucking him. Which was a good game plan but you know, I'm an intuitive, so things got weird. \n\nPlaces I probably messed up:\n\n* told him about past relationships edit: briefly - we were catching up on what we've been doing for the past 11 years and I said "dated one guy for about three years and got out of a year long relationship 6 months ago" and that was it.\n* told him like a year of my journal was dedicated to him in high school\n* listed off a bunch of facts about him because... well... I'm a creep\n* got super giggly after sex and said "this has nothing to do with your performance, that was bad, but more so with the fact that I just fucked my high school crush" DISCLAIMER: he said the sex was bad first (not on my side. It lasted like 2 minutes, but I'm pretty forgiving of that, especially on the first time). \n* I'd told him I had gotten laid the night before. But he also high-fived me... so.\n* Oh yeah, I was pretty hammered. But I hold my booze well.\n\nPlaces it probably went well...?:\n\n* He said "this is the most relaxed I've felt in a long time" like while we were banging. \n* He said I was good in bed.\n* Liked dinner.\n* He hung out in the morning for like an hour before going to work.\n* Said he did, in fact, want a redemption lay. \n* Talking to him was actually really nice.\n* The jokes were on point.\n* We avoided talking about politics. \n\nSo, question 1: How do we think this interaction went? I've sent him a couple of gifs the last couple days and haven't gotten a response. I have ONLY texted twice. \n\nQuestion 2: if he does hit me up, how do I proceed? I'm mostly looking for FWBs... but actually talking to him was really nice and I was surprisingly comfortable with him (he kind of bullied me in high school, so I didn't expect that). So I guess I wouldn't mind actually dating, but that seems unlikely.
5	I think the question is, do you really want to be a FWB for him or are you just convincing yourself of that? TBH it doesn't sound like he's all that into you. \n\nHowever sending a gif image via text doesn't really warrant a reply. Asking direct questions or making plans warrants a reply. Since he likes to poke fun at you, poke fun at him. He seems to be "neg hitting" you, making you fight for his approval. This is a tactic used by sleazy men in fast seduction techniques. He got what he wanted so now he has lost interest. You can use the strategy of making him think he's not good enough for you, in which he will be clamoring for your attention again, but I do not suggest this.\n\nInstead, i suggest you might want to take time for yourself and ask yourself why you need validation from men who do not value you? 
3	It went well. If the ESTP says this is the most comfortable he's been for a long time and it's got something to do with being connected... like *during sex*... then you're doing good things for him. I usually finish much faster if the girl reacts well to me. Ego massage whilst fucking is great sex even if it's quick.\n\nWould proably put the short duration down to desire as well. He'll get back up to marathon sex after a few lays. I know this. Because i have met plenty of ESTPs now (and just generally male friends). And to be fair ... we do talk about it.\n\nThere's stuff you listed as bad that doesn't matter. You gave the guy some ego massage - that's great.\n\nYou also presented yourself as not clingy. That's ideal.\n\nBut you also made it clear that you've always wanted that dick. This is perfect.\n\nESTP likes to be your champion.\n\n> I've sent him a couple of gifs the last couple days and haven't gotten a response. I have ONLY texted twice. \n\nWell he probably feels comfortable being silent. ESTPs don't always give confirmation so if you want that you should be direct - i.e. "come spend time with me" will do a lot more work than making him laugh thru a text. We are much more thoughtful about things in our direct environment. I often come across cold in text conversation.\n\nBut by all means try to engage a conversation on something he''s interested in that you also like nebough to not be dumb in conversation.\n\nGetting deeper with an ESTP means enabling them to do the things they want to do. In return they will show their affection by "championing" for you... sounds pretty gay but i should know how it feels.\n\nIt is a good idea to challenge the ESTP at things he is interested in. This is a way of enabling the ESTP.\n\n> I'm mostly looking for FWBs\n\nWhat? Oh right... are you sure? Cos it sounds like you want to date him.\n\n> he kind of bullied me in high school, so I didn't expect that\n\nESTPs will often tease people who they like or if they think there's chemistry - it's actually a sign of how comfortable we are with you as a person to tease you casually\n\nunless it was very mean teasing... but an ESSTP friend recently described this to me "there's a fine line between love and hate... but both are powerful feelings..." he was talking about the fact that not caring at all is the opposite end of the spectrum but love and hate are not so far apart.\n\n> I guess I wouldn't mind actually dating, but that seems unlikely.\n\nFind out what the ESTP wants to do and enable. Failing that provoke the ESTP with challenges.\n\nBut there's a good chance the ESTP might be shy about not lasting long. He made a joke about bad sex because that's how ESTPs cover insecurity. Or at least that's how i would feel comfortable with it. Alluding to poor performance is a sort of "you should see how many fucks i could give" statement.\n\nI frequently joke about my shortcomings with people i am comfortable with. To be fair i've started to reject almost all criticisms of my character. It's not a good idea to take it very seriously when an ESTP jokes about their shortcomings... because we did that to distract you from it in the first place.\n\nMaybe.\n\nBut also maybe not. I don't know this guy. From my perspective ... i'm fairly confident of my dick. But if i haven't been laid in a while it's gonna be a quick fuck followed by another longer fuck.\n\n---\n\n> My friend (ESTJ) says not to text him again until I get a response. Good plan?\n\nYou asked this to someone else... the best result really would be to consider a week timescale. You want the ESTP around next weekend? Then you need to talk. Considering you've recently fucked i'd probably call.\n\nBut i'm also terrible at social ettiquete on these things.\n\nI just don't really care about people's boundaries. Try not to make a plan in your head but call the dude and ask him what he's doing at the weekend cos you'd like to spend some time with them.\n\nThat's not clingy.\n\nBut if he's busy you have to be cool with it and say "maybe another time". Say that positively... like a question and you'll see what the guy can do... this is light pressure to make a decision. It an empowering way of getting he ESTP to stop dragging his feet. But largely because sounding sad would be clingy. And you're not desperate.\n\nYou probably know how much you can pressure this person. Some ESTPs are less sensitive ... i'm quite anti-authority. Which means i frequently need to make an effort to overcome the sour taste of following someone else's goals.\n\nBut that's not the case if i really like the person or if their goals allign with mine.\n\nFootnote; Did the ESTP tell you the last time they got laid when you were being quite open about your sex life? The answer doesn't really make much difference but if they shared or not shows a level of confidence and comfort.

1	Seems like you're an ENTP, to be honest when any penis is in a vagina in straight sex, it feels like home/relaxation when sensory nerves interconnect physically with another warm live body.\n\nI kinda get the point of this post since from the very beginning it seemed like a FWB and you're trying to find out if there might be something substantial and I don't mean "sharing of dreams/feelings" cause you can do that to anyone like people post on reddit. All I can say about ESTPs, is that once they've figured you out that you really don't have much to offer them substantial for the long term they'll move on. Again this is nothing physical, sexual, or emotional, those things can be easily achieved. Now, this doesn't mean they are liars, etc this is simply honest with themselves. \n\nIt's funny when I see thinkers date other thinkers because it's just easier just like feelers doing the same. The funny thing is other feelers have little to offer me except companionship when bored. \n\nMaybe that's the case\n\n(INFP)\n
2	ESTPs: how do you deal with serious fights?	When you get in a fight with a close friend, how do you deal with it? Do you? 
4	I'm a notorious bridge burner. I don't fight close friends, I recognize a problem to be something that either can't be solved or I don't want solved and I kill it. \n\n/u/Kbnation has an agreeable approach. \n\n\nPunish pathetic attempts to shoehorn bullshit and/or crawl back 
3	Estps are... Interesting people. 
3	It really depends on how much they have wronged me, pissed me off, or upset me. If they have really wronged me, I'll just cut them out then and there and if they try to initiate a (sincere) apology I'd probably forgive them as long as they understand what they did wrong and won't again. If they pissed me off and it was just a disagreement (tbh even more serious things) I'd probably just get over it if they say something funny enough. If they actually upset me I either cut them off or if they're a REALLY good friend when they come to apologize I'd probably confront them and ask what was up.\n\nIf I was the one that fucked up I probably would own up to it right away. Likeee "Hey, ____, I know I fucked up by  _____ and I'm sure it made you feel ____. I'm sorry. That may not be enough, but that's all I got and I can't go back and change my actions, but if I could I would. I hope you accept my apology."\n\nAlso, on the rare occasion that someone is worth it to me (or I'm stuck with them), I will take blame that isn't mine in order to not have to deal with the drama anymore lol\nDon't know why that got bolded \n
2	Usually I back off I won't get violent unless seriously provoked.
1	That's not a serious fight.\n\nBecause a serious fight involves disabling the other person before they can hurt me. In physical fights i would generally try to wrestle the opponent into submission. This is just quicker and more controlled.\n\nBut i think what you're talking about is an argument. Even if it gets physical i'm not likely to damage your face. But if you're talking about falling out with a friend and no longer wanting them around then we don't need to fight over that. Just don't talk to them anymore.\n\nIf a close friend wants to fight me they are no longer considered friendly and therefore they kinda get dismissed from thought unless i'm currently irritated by something they have done or said.\n\nI don't need to fight or pick on people that i don't like. But if this person tried to manipulate me into making amends and i didn't feel like it i would probably work out a way to punish them.
1	"What's a little fight, tomorrow you'll be boys again" 
3	Small talk	What do you guys think of it? Do you think it's a nice way to get to know people? Or is it as useless as the commercials before YouTube videos, and you wish we could just skip to deeper conversations?\n\nI've asked this in all the mbti sub-reddits (is that what it's called?) Someone posted an article about it in the INTP group, if you want to read it, but you don't have to, just want to know what you think. -curious intp\n\nAlso I don't know how to define small talk, but I think it's safe to include social graces, work/school, and weather (I apologize if you are a weather nerd or something and actually find it very intriguing to talk about)
3	I just talk to people. Small talk is triesome if it becomes predictable (i.e. regular small talk with teh same person).\n\nBut i will talk to anyone about anything really. Talking small is a precursor to a deeper communication... however on a day to day basis most people do not care to engage deeply ... and you can tell.
1	I make small talk first then delve into deeper questions. 
1	I make small talk pretty often with random people. It's just a way to get to know strangers. Who knows they could be really interesting people, or they could be your next best friend. Making small talk with people you'd see again is good, so you'll have a springboard or rapport to build on the next time you see them.  
9	Anyone else was ENFP last year and now is an ESTP ?	How do you feel about it?
3	I don't know about this tbh... the cognitive functions of these two types are super different. ENFP is Ne-Fi-Te-Si, but ESTP is Se-Ti-Fe-Ni. Even if you believe/think about shadow functions (when in stress), the priorities of the functions are a lot different too. \n\nMaybe you'll find someone with the same situation as you though, hope you find some answers.
2	I am 17 years old and i consider myself an ESTP (atm), I have not been reading a lot about how this personality "system" works, all i know is that everytime i take the tests (on the internet) i get different results. In April i was ESTP, in May i was ESTJ, in June i was ENTJ, and in Juli i was ENTP, and in august i was ISTJ, and now in september i got my results as an ESTP again.... Therefore i consider these tests, and theories irrelevant... I enjoy reading about the different personalities and try to find out who i am.... I know that i am only 17 years old and still in "development" but i love extremesport, money, and doing whatever that pops up in my head... \n\n2 days ago i traveled across the country purely out of fun. I also joined a random class at a random school, said i was a new student, everyone belived me and i was just fucking around, got a lot of new friends and leaved after i got bored\n I love adrenaline, flying and im going to get my parachute sertificate next month... I have been hustling for the last two years, and had a job i didn't really like... i want to become a stockbroker or a grunder as we call an entrepreneur here in norway\n\nBut in the end, im only 17 so I don't really know.... sorry if my grammar is bad, school is not my thing... hehe\n\nThe fun is when you learn how the MBTI tests works, why you get the results you get, and then try to manipulate it the next time to get different results, like i have been doing the last couple of hours...
1	Actually, yeah. I took the test for the first time back in middle school just because and got ENFP. Took it again a few days ago and got ESTP. In retrospect, ESTP makes a lot more sense to me because of my level of activity and my learning style. I always have to be doing something, and in my family, I'm always the first person to try something.\n\nGranted, the test said I had a 5% preference of T to F, but that's because my parents raised me to not be an asshole, so I'm not as blunt as others because I usually watch what I say. I know I'm not a textbook ESTP, but I still agree with it more than any other type.
1	I've typed as ENFP before. EP's have a lot of the same tendencies. I analyzed my family dynamic/nurture growing up. \n\nDad - ENFP \nMom - ISFJ\nSister - INFP\nBrother - INTP \n\nI score high Ne because I've been around it my whole life, but not as high as Se. I was the black sheep so I basically know I'm a sensor. I can handle a lot of Ne for a bit then get irritable, that's how I know I'm not N. \n\nAs far as F, being a girl T is a little weird, so it took some time to realize it, but I've definitely embraced it. And am happier for it. 
1	Enegram & Big 5 Are Not Popular Because There's Nothing Much To Read About Them In Comparison To MBTI?	Why are "Enegram" & "Big 5" test not as popular as MBTI?\n\nI think it may be because there is a lot to read about your personality type online after taking a MBTI test but nothing much after taking the "Enegram" or "Big 5" test.\n\nWhat do you think?
3	> Why are "Enegram" & "Big 5" test not as popular as MBTI?\n\nI disagree with the principle point and consider it open to interpretation.\n\nBig 5 is used in public sector social services and mental health fields. But MBTI is not because it is a rational model and lacks empirical proof - plus it's not so hot at predicting behavior.\n\nHowever in the private sector 80% of the fortune 500 companies use MBTI to build teams and manage staff / resources.\n\nSo it really depends on how you define "popular".

2	Help me figure out my estp friend	Hello, infj here!\nSo I'm looking for some insight from the estp men of this subreddit because I'm caught in the middle of a tense friendship/love-hateship between my two best friends, an estp guy and an enfp girl. Here's the sitch, both of them started off really great friends, they are both fun loving, spontaneous individuals. Over time though, my enfp best friend (lets called her Amy) realized that estp (let's call him Jim) could not satisfy her emotional needs as he did not like delving into deep abstract subjects the way enfps and infjs (myself) tend to do on a regular basis. Nevertheless, she started developing feelings for him. Jim, being someone who enjoys physical pleasure, also developed an attraction for Amy from all the constant hanging out, and one night a few months into the friendship they ended up kissing and Amy confessed her feelings to him. Jim, being the non-committal type accepted this but basically friendzoned her. In the months following, Amy recounted to me episodes where he would act strange around her, being physically flirty with her when they were alone and things like that, but always saying he could never be in a relationship with her because she was one of his best friends and he didn't want to hurt her. Meanwhile, Amy still have strong feelings for Jim but is keeping it inside until a few months after that when she confessed again, and still got the same reaction. Jim continued to act the same way, being flirty one minute, then pissy the next, basically giving off mixed signals at all times. Then about two weeks ago, Amy couldn't handle the treatment she was getting from him, especially since she has been trying desperately to move on from this person who obviously couldn't make up his mind, and decided to have a sincere talk with him about their friendship. Lo and behold, in a moment of weakness and vulnerability, they ended up making out and nearly hooking up, but it didn't go that far because they both wordlessly agreed it would ruin the friendship forever. Fast forward to today and the three of us go on a day trip, and I being very observant, noticed Jim acting his usually flirty touchy self with Amy but with a very fidgety, tense attitude. It was like watching a middleschooler be mean to a girl but everyone really knew that he actually liked her, you know? This was what my intuition was telling me, even though Jim has stated numerous times that he had no feelings towards Amy. What gives??? Can any of you guys relate to any of this or at least have any idea why my estp friend might be acting this way??
6	They will likely talk past each other when they feel differently about something.\n\nMy sister is ENFp and i am ESTP. We can get on really well - when being productive we offer a lot of complexity together due to the vastly different perspectives.\n\nOften due to similar temperament we reach similar conclusions but from completely different places. This is a sibling relationship so we have had a great deal of time to work on it.\n\n> they are both fun loving, spontaneous individuals\n\nExxP\n\n> Over time though, my enfp best friend (lets called her Amy) realized that estp (let's call him Jim) could not satisfy her emotional needs as he did not like delving into deep abstract subjects the way enfps and infjs (myself) tend to do on a regular basis.\n\nThe ESTP can dive into deep abstract concept that are related to reality. Okay... what does that mean? I have no problem debating theorhitical physics, political philosophy, economic policy, video game meta, guitar technique...\n\nI guess the difference is that some people consider hese things abstract and the ESTP doesn't.\n\nBut this is part of a challenge for the ESTP in personal development. Seeing things through that he may not be particularly interested in is difficult.\n\n> Jim, being someone who enjoys physical ~~pleasure~~ sensation, also developed an attraction for Amy from all the constant hanging out, and one night a few months into the friendship they ended up kissing and Amy confessed her feelings to him. Jim, being the non-committal type accepted this but basically friendzoned her.\n\nI know why the caged bird sings.\n\n> Amy recounted to me episodes where he would act strange around her, being physically flirty with her when they were alone and things like that, but always saying he could never be in a relationship with her because she was one of his best friends and he didn't want to hurt her.\n\nThe ESTP wants to fuck but respects that the ENFP wants more than that so he doesn't push for fucking unless the ENFP is understanding that they can't (and he doesn't want) to change their current relationship too much.\n\nFucking does change things. But if there's no false pretense it could be okay for both parties.\n\nUnfortunately the female will likely not understand what the ESTP considers falsse pretense due to Fi and the way it wantts to build relationships. The ESTP is sensitive to the use of Fi but finds it controlling - he is compelled to act or behave in a certain way and doesn't enjoy that.\n\n---\n\nI should add at this point that i've dated ENFP. I'm relating my experience. I tried to end it after two weeks because i could tell it was going to go bad.\n\nEdit; No regrets. But please notice how i said "*i tried to end it*".\n\nFirst time round didn't do the job.\n\n> Meanwhile, Amy still have strong feelings for Jim but is keeping it inside until a few months after that when she confessed again, and still got the same reaction. Jim continued to act the same way, being flirty one minute, then pissy the next, basically giving off mixed signals at all times.\n\nThese signals are not mixed. "Want to fuck. Not want to be more than friends".\n\nI think we all know it's true here but we like to pretend it isn't true. Essentially the ESTP likes this person. But they don't want comittment because ESTP's are quite sensitive to "turf" and ... well ... their environment.\n\n> In the months following, Amy recounted to me episodes where he would act strange around her, being physically flirty with her when they were alone and things like that, but always saying he could never be in a relationship with her because she was one of his best friends and he didn't want to hurt her.\n\nThis is not weird. "How else do you politely tell someone that you're okay with fucking but not okay with love and strings and emotional needs?"\n\nBut this is the problem. The ESTP values freedom above most things. Se dom and Ti creative.\n\nThe ENFP values possibilities and creativity above most things (Ne - i don't know). Ne dom with Fi creative.\n\nThe ESTP wants superficial because it's more fun.\n\nThe ENFP wants more meaningful because it's more fun.\n\n---\n\n> Then about two weeks ago, Amy couldn't handle the treatment she was getting from him\n\nTreatment is a pejorative terms here. But you have to acknowledge that they are talking past each other. One keeps saying "i want meanigful" and the other says "i like you enough to have fun without getting hurt by meaningful".\n\n> but it didn't go that far because they both wordlessly agreed it would ruin the friendship forever\n\nYeah probably. The ESTP knows that the ENFP will never get over it. So in call him a decent chap for not putting his dick in when opportunity presented itself.\n\nBut i would also probably do the same thing and try to avoid ruining the friendship. But ESTP is an impulsive type. And like... if the opportunity keeps presenting itself it's only a matter of time until **carpe that fucking diem**.\n\n> Fast forward to today and the three of us go on a day trip, and I being very observant, noticed Jim acting his usually flirty touchy self with Amy but with a very fidgety, tense attitude. It was like watching a middleschooler be mean to a girl but everyone really knew that he actually liked her, you know? This was what my intuition was telling me, even though Jim has stated numerous times that he had no feelings towards Amy. What gives?\n\nWell as i mentioned the ESTP likes this person but doesn't want to be controlled by the social engineering that we call "dating".\n\nThat doesn't mean they can't have a relationship but the ENFP must be willing to give up the traditional idea of relationship and comittment and understand that building a relationship with an ESTP requires that you keep feeding the Se and not put it in a cage.\n\nThe female sex role works like a filter. You guys reject men who are not worth the process... And you accept the ones that meet your personal criterea.\n\nBut that naturally leads to a mentality that is caged and controlling.\n\nThe ESTP will never walk into an emotional trap. He's too sensitive to emotional environment. And that Fe is the relief function. It's terribly stressful to have a choppy emotional environment.\n\n*Why is that a problem?*... trust me... ENFP can manipulate emotional environment.\n\nESTP ENFP relationships will be challenging but both parties stand to grow a lot. However i do find that Ne-Fi suggestions are not always particualrly helpful or easy to implement for an Se-Ti user.\n\nThere can, however, be a great deal of curiosity between these types. Similar temperaments but totally different functions.\n\n---\n\n> Can any of you guys relate to any of this or at least have any idea why my estp friend might be acting this way?\n\n"I Want to fuck. But i don't want to *not* be friends afterward."\n\nThe best relationships are where you stay friends anyway. The very worst thing the ENFp can do is say that the ESTP took advantage of the attraction. It takes two to fuck. If it happens and the ENFP doesn't get a relationship comitment she may be tempted to manipulate the emotional environment - which would immediately ruin the friendship. The ESTP see's that as a betrayal of trust and truth.

1	Not a guy here, but from what you recall, I extrapolate that he is vain, needs attention and validation and has little self control (in the moment sort of guy). 
2	Syracuse NY	 Anyone live in Syracuse. I would love to meet someone that reflects my personality!  I feel like if I had met someone like that I would understand myself a little better after visually seeing them.  Has anyone else achieve this goal, what were your thoughts?\n\nThanks\n\nESTP 
2	Yeah i recently moved into a house with another ESTP.\n\nIt is very useful to observe the similarity between us. I can also spot some nuance differences due to our personal life experiences and the environments we were raised in. I'm 32 and the housemate is 33. We grew up in different countries.\n\nThe other ESTP is likely enneagram 8 whereas i am 7.\n\nAside from that difference we use very similar language, reasoning style, have similar temperaments, draw very similar conclusions, have similar priorities and interests. We are also both keenly observant and read body language quite easily.\n\nOur method of problem solving, debate strategy and win-win scenario fixing is the same. We even tell stories in similar ways (i.e. the framing and reveal factors to entertain the audience). This was the first thing that made me think that this person is estp; arguing with our landlord.\n\nI was able to confirm Ti aux after seeing this cool character begin to make notes on a video game (no mans sky). Exactly the same way i made notes on starcraft when learning build orders. This might not unusual... to make notes on a video game... but for an impulsive personality that shares lots in common with myself... then it's a confirmation of Se-Ti. Due to the intensity of persona and fairly hedonistic daily activities i have assumed Se dom. And due to the other similarities i settled on estp.\n\nBoth of us suffer from lower back pain due to skating and video games.\n\nBoth smoke lots of weed. Both are skeptical of mainstream political ideals and the status quo.\n\n

I'm interested in seeing what correlations exist between certain types and various random things, so I've created a big survey. Its a little bit long, it will probably take 10-30 min depending how fast you are at filling out surveys. I tried to mix fun questions with serious questions and so topics include pop culture, politics, art, lifestyle, etc.\n\nI also posted this in /r/mbti, but I'd like some more varied responses (INxx types really like filling out surveys) The survey is at [this link to google forms](https://goo.gl/forms/fHSemrg0ey1EYfK63)\n\nIt is completely anonymous, handled by google forms. After you take it it will let you see the raw results, please don't spoil these results for others. Once I have enough responses, I will perform a statistical analysis on the results and share them on /r/mbti.\n\nIf you know anyone else interested in MBTI, feel free to share the survey, but please only fill it out once yourself.\n\n**Please don't spoil** the survey questions for others, particularly the trivia questions, I want to see what types have knowledge/interest of certain things.\n\n*I'd like to know (without spoilers), what you thought of the survey and what additional questions you would have included. So please let me know.*
1	One question was repeated.  \nAnd You should have more than 4 possible answers to your questions. 2/3 becomes very easy to pick. I read on reddit that 7 is the optimal number.  \n\nI followed the curve, exept that the people of reddit is a unsosial bunch.
0	now that i know that i'm an ESTP female it all makes sense!	i use to wonder why i was so carefree for a girl and how i never got hurt in relationships but since i took the MBTI test and looked into the ESTP personality type it makes so much sense! if only there were more of us around!
5	Lol Im a female estp that gets hurt from relationships., even if its less intense. Dont lie to yourselves
5	Are you 13
2	[deleted]
1	mhm. dont shrek yourself by being too carefree. >.>
1	For the sake of clarity, you're not implying that you just recently came to this assessment of yourself, are you? Don't treat it as a novelty, please.  
2	Anybody else find being hit on annoying?	When I'm interested in someone, I pursue them. I don't like being hit on, although I find it flattering that they have the balls to hit on me (that's only if they know me well, not random strangers in the street.)\n\nAny other estps feel the same way? \n
5	nah, being hit on is nice. it's flattering, I like the compliments and the attention. but that's just if it's a brief thing that I know isn't going anywhere...a flirty conversation, a compliment in passing, etc. \n\nwhen I'm interested in someone and they're too eager in return...then I lose my interest. 
2	no. I like to be wined and dined.
1	I like the chase. Its no fun when it's easy 
1	Yes I find it annoying. I should probably look into a way to turn down girls with a bit of subtlety. At the moment I just feign ignorance and then ignore them afterwards. \n\nAlso the chase is a lot more fun. Being hit on is boring. 
1	i'm a female ESTP and if i don't get hit on then there is no way a relationship can happen. i don't make the first move because 9 times out of 10 the guy likes me more.
1	Do you feel like you don't like to be hit on because if you're getting hit on, you already felt like you "won". Meaning that they are already interested, so where the fun/game in it? 
1	SAME.
4	Is my ESTP best friend a sociopath?	Hi there. ENTP here. And I am starting to see that my best friend, who typically scores as an ESTP when we take the tests for fun, has issues. To be more specific, I believe she has some kind of antisocial personality disorder.\n\nIn a nutshell, my other friend (INFJ) and I are roommates with said ESTP. She's had hints of issues in the past with others and even us, to some extent, but nothing I really considered until now. Basically, she's been spending all of her money on shopping, going out to eat and bars, weed, spotting her boyfriend's rent, etc. before paying her own rent. She owes me about $300 in Internet bills, spotting her cash for things, etc, and she owes our other roommates about $500 in bills, etc. I have evidence of her lying about having paid rent, and I had to pay her rent on top of my own last month (which was the straw that broke the camel's back). This has been going on for six months. We tried being silent, then we tried being nice...only recently have I been assertive. For what it's worth, she hasn't been making attempts to pay off loans that her sister cosigned, so her sister has to resort to publicly posting on the ESTP's Facebook to get her attention about that situation. She bought pet birds on impulse about eight months ago, and stopped taking care of them, leaving them to die like three months ago. (I've since been the one taking care of them.) She keeps lying and making up excuses, and when I call her out on a lie, she finds a way to turn it around on me and make me feel guilty (until I later think about it and then just get more pissed off.) She seems to only do things if there's an immediate positive incentive, and it verges on neglect and abuse to all the people, things, and animals in her life. There's more to it, but it's too much for one Reddit post. But her lies, stealing money, avoiding people, impulses, and other actions lead me to believe she's a sociopath, because she seems to (and acts) not feel any guilt or empathy about any of this. She does't seem to mind that her actions almost got us evicted, or that her older sister's credit is ruined, or that our INFJ roommate hasn't been able to pay her phone bill since January because she's been paying for all of the ESTP's shit. And the ESTP will say just the right things, just in time, and pay us a little money here and there, to keep us quiet. Only now am I starting to see this as problematic.\n\nShe might not have an antisocial personality disorder. It's possible she's not even an ESTP. And I, by no means, certainly believe ESTPs as a personality have antisocial personality disorders. But I've read here and there that ESTPs share many traits with those who have antisocial PDs. So for all I know, she could just be an undeveloped ESTP with no personality disorder, or she could have a totally different personality with a personality disorder! (Or, maybe, I'm the one with a mild case of narcissistic personality disorder and this is some clusterfuck of projection and truth! Who's to say they're mutually exclusive? Lol.)\n\nI don't know where to begin. She needs help. I need help for her, and for myself, because of her. I don't know if I should kick her out, try to use positive reinforcement to change her habits, or tell her parents (who live on the other side of the country and can't do anything)? It's just a frustrating situation, and I don't want to jump to conclusions or hurt her or our friendship. I just don't know what to do at this point, so I am starting here. Think she's a sociopath, especially if ESTPs are prone to ASPDs? And what should I do to solve this?
5	I doubt this is an estp problem. it sounds like a "she needs to get therapy" problem. \n\nI'm no pro at anything but naps but it sounds like she could be bipolar, or depressed, or just a bitch. kick her out and cut your losses. 
14	Extraverted Sensing	by Leona Haas & Mark Hunziker\n\n**Dominant for ESTP and ESFP**\n\n**Auxiliary for ISTP and ISFP**\n\n*Extraverted Sensing most clearly resembles the descriptions in the following pages when it is in the dominant (first) position. In fact, these descriptions are based on input from people for whom the process is dominant (ESTP and ESFP). But even with Extraverted Sensing in the first position, what you observe will vary noticeably depending on other factors-particularly whether it is paired up with Introverted Thinking or Introverted Feeling in the auxiliary (second) position.* \n\n*In order to draw a complete picture of the “essence” of Extraverted Sensing, one must use bits and pieces that cannot individually demonstrate “pure” Se. Like the splashes of color in an impressionist painting, however, the bullets in this chapter, when taken all together, reveal a vivid portrait that will enable you to recognize Extraverted Sensing when you see it. Knowing what the process would look like if it could be separated from other influences is the foundation of process watching the practice that will quickly take you as far as you want to go in understanding personality.*\n\nExtraverted Sensing is an information-gathering process. It focuses on the current objective, external world to fully experience the details of the environment through the five senses. Se draws energy and enjoyment directly from people, objects, and events.\n\n**KEY FEATURES**\n\n**Extraverted Sensing**\n\n* Has an outer focus on acquiring information through the five senses.\n* Is the only perception process that is not influenced by associations from the past, present, or future.\n* Is aware of and connected to the current external environment.\n* Quickly notices objective facts with all the details.\n* Relies heavily on unusually accurate visual perception: seeing is believing.\n* Values the object itself, not one’s personal reaction or relationship to it.\n* Seeks the full sensory experience of the environment in the moment.\n\n**WHAT’S GOING ON?**\n\n**Extraverted Sensing**\n\n* Looks at things objectively and sees what is physically there.\n* Gathers pure, unfiltered sensory information from the external world.\n* Takes in the current environment as a collection of discrete bits of detailed information.\n* Constantly seeks variety and novelty as sensory experiences change from moment to moment.\n* Needs the immediate sensation of an external object, person, or event in order to have an experience. There is no experience without active involvement in the environment through one or more of the senses. Appreciates vivid details: colors, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures. Seeks raw, unsorted, unaltered experiences in order to feel alive. Is energized by the current experience.\n \n\n**When people are using their preferred Extraverted Sensing**\n\n* Their awareness is entirely focused upon the here and now.\n* Virtually everything that can be detected by the senses gets noticed.\n* The trigger for perception is the current external environment.\n* The world consists only of what can be perceived by the five senses right now.\n* Detailed visual perception is particularly important.\n* A level of attention is sustained that would quickly put others on “data overload.”\n* They do not want to miss anything.\n* They value practical, hands-on experiences above all.\n* Memories from the past and possibilities for the future are not very important.\n* They are acutely aware of what is.\n* Their perceptions are verifiable.\n* Everything is a new experience. No two moments or situations are exactly the same.\n* Anything that is tangible is interesting.\n* Immediate sensory experience is what life is all about. It defines one’s existence.\n* Life is one continual sensual experience.\n* They are enjoying life to the fullest, living for today.\n* The current experience itself has intensity.\n\n**FROM THE OUTSIDE, LOOKING IN**\n\n**When we experience people who are engaging their preferred extraverted Sensing, they**\n\n* Seem to need almost constant external stimulation or they quickly become bored.\n* Seem to miss nothing and overlook no detail of the immediate environment.\n* Can be prone to repeating mistakes by failing to anticipate what is going to happen in the future as a consequence of what is happening now.\n* Can be reflective, but the reflections are tied to the current world.\n* Often have difficulty doing the steps of an operation in an orderly sequence. They prefer a random, “take it as it comes” approach.\n* Possess practical, hands-on skills.\n* Are very down-to-earth, realistic, and pragmatic.\n* Speak about objective facts: what is there, no more and no less.\n* Talk in very literal terms using concrete, sensory, and descriptive present-tense language: “I smell, I hear, I see.”\n* Often show attention by focusing their eyes or tilting their ears or head toward you.\n* Sometimes can be seen darting their eyes all around the room, observing everything.\n* Listen at first to people telling of their experiences but do not have a need for, or a high interest in, hearing someone else’s stories. Want information from others but not in too much detail. They cannot experience the world through other people’s interpretations. Often listen with intense, focused attention. Their eyes lock on you, following your every gesture. They may move closer or lean in. They are focused on taking in information that they may show no reaction to what you are saying. \n* Pick up on other people’s body language and other signals and will often automatically mirror them. Tend to use and need nonverbal communication, such as a smile, a wink, or a touch.\n* Appear to accept life as it happens. Seem to relate easily to people, to enjoy being with people. Appear to accept people for who they are – to have few illusions about them.\n* Can be perceived as shallow because of their outward tendency to “go with the flow.” Are always interacting with the environment.\n* Tend to be quick to assess data and to size up a situation. Do not seem to feel a need to conform to what others think is acceptable, assuming that people simply have their own unique styles. Are usually active, restless, and adventurous. Sometimes seem like hyperactive children. The immediate environment is constantly stimulating and distracting them. Are engaging, fun-loving, and social. Are very spontaneous and react quickly to changes in their environment. Can blend into almost any culture, environment, or situation.\n\n**CONTRIBUTIONS**\n\n**Special perspectives and approaches of Extraverted Sensing**\n\n* A “live for today” attitude\n* Learn quickly from experience\n* An aptitude for learning new languages, including the subtle details of intonation and gestures\n* Negotiate by quickly getting to the core of the matter\n* Reliability in observing and reporting objective facts\n* A knack for being a “mover and shaker” when it comes to concrete tasks\n* Can quickly find practical solutions, to find an immediate fix for a problem\n* A willingness to help, to play the role of a good Samaritan\n\n**FROM THE INSIDE**\n\n**Paraphrased descriptions of what it is like to gather information through one’s preferred Extraverted Sensing**\n\n* I need to actually experience something in order to understand it. I need to either look at a bicycle or at a picture of a bike in order to assemble one. Then I can duplicate what I see. Written instructions are not very helpful.\n* I personally hate history. I figure if it’s already happened, then who cares?\n* I need to see and experience something before I believe it. I’m the classic “doubting Thomas.”\n* In a restaurant, I can be completely attentive to the conversation and interaction at our table and also know everything that’s going on in other parts of the room.\n* I let life happen rather than trying to control it.\n* As a child I had to touch everything. I still do. The textures and colors just grab me.\n* I love to be outside, feeling the sun and the breeze, hearing the insects and the birds. I love the feel of soil on my hands, planting flowers, and pulling weeds.\n* The first thing in the morning, I look outside to check the weather. Then I turn on the news to see what’s happening in the rest of the world.\n* l never watch a taped game or event. If it has already happened, what is the sense of watching?\n* Other adults seem to constantly be telling kids “Don’t touch!” “Don’t put that in your mouth!” But I can relate to the young child’s fascination with exploring and experiencing the environment.\n* I don’t do lists, not even grocery lists. What I buy is what catches my eye.\n* I walk up and down the aisles looking for items that look interesting.\n* I can be observant at the expense of imagination,\n* If you want to get my attention, tell me a story with concrete images.\n* Give me the information I need to do the job, and then let me do it.\n* I show people that I care about them by what I do. Actions speak louder than words.\n* Enjoy it, use it, or put up with it.\n* What you need to know is right in front of you.\n* I tell it like I see it.\n* I value my autonomy and flexibility. If any rules interfere with that, I’ll usually just ignore them.\n* I like school, but would enjoy it more if we could change the daily routine. It’s boring to always know what is coming next.\n* I got into trouble in school for talking and moving around a lot. To this day, I have a hard time sitting still.\n* My style of organization is my own, for example, it’s hard for me to use someone else’s filing system.\n* I’m impulsive, and I have a hard time listening to advice from others.\n* Everything I do is fun. If it isn’t fun, I probably will not do it.\n* I don’t worry about the future. I deal with stuff when it happens.\n* Often I do what I do to get reactions from others. It makes life more interesting. \n* I tend to jump into the deep end of the pool without thinking.\n* I’m like the Energizer Bunny: I keep going and going. Sitting still wears me out. If I sit still for ten minutes, I fall asleep.\n* When I hit the bed at night, I immediately fall asleep.\n* I am at my best in a crisis. Sometimes if there is no crisis, I will create one.\n* I tend to put everything off to the last minute.\n* I’m in constant motion. I need to move.\n* When looking at a tree, it is not so much like seeing the tree as a whole but seeing every leaf, all the shades of green, the shapes of the leaves, the texture and details of the bark.\n* I usually know the time of day, within a few minutes, without using a watch. I guess I notice environmental cues like shadows or the angle of the sun.\n* In choosing a career, I find I need to actually experience it by watching a video, going to a job site, or even trying it out. A written job description does not interest me or provide the information I need. It is not tangible enough.\n* I get a lot of joy and energy from little things: flowers, clouds, smells. No detail is too small to be a potential source of excitement and delight.\n* I can give you directions to all sorts of places quite easily. I can tell you how many trees you’ll pass and the color of the roof on the house at the corner.\n* My closet is organized by color. If something is not in the right place, color-wise, I have to move it because it is not pleasing to my eye.\n* I just could not do the workshop exercise. The colors of the objects we were working with clashed. It was too distracting.\n* I have never liked tomatoes. However, every so often I have to try one. Since each time it is a new experience, I just might like them that day.\n* I cannot sit still if something is going on. Open space schooling was very difficult for me. I couldn’t tune out the activities that were happening all around. I heard everything that was going on in the classrooms next to mine, and they often sounded as if they were doing something more exciting than we were doing.\n* I have never needed to return a clothing purchase because of a hole or defect. I notice it in the store before I buy it.\n* I rarely need to buy a drink when I go out. I always know someone soon will. Before the night is over, I’ll know almost everyone.\n* Often, if someone is wearing clothing that clashes, I find it very distracting and cannot concentrate on what the person is saying.\n\n**VIGNETTES**\n\n**Scenes from the world of Extraverted Sensing**\n\n* If I’m boating with friends, I’ll be the one who is really enjoying the moment. I will be talking to everyone, feeling the wind, hearing the sea gulls, jumping in the water to see how it feels.\n* In a “type-alike” group exercise that involves describing an object, our group is usually the first to finish or will divert into other activities before any other group. There is only so much concrete data in a simple object. When you finish saying how the object looks, feels, smells, sounds, and tastes, you are done. There is nothing more to describe.\n* Visiting an art gallery with friends, I realized that no one else saw the details in the artwork that I noticed immediately. In a painting of a house, for example, I saw the tiny key in the door. My friends had not noticed it and were amazed that I had. On the other hand, * I can’t remember what I wore yesterday and have only a vague recollection of what I did.\n* I like to smell, touch, taste, or even listen to produce before buying. To decide whether fruit and vegetables are fresh and ripe, * I tap on watermelons, smell cantaloupes, and taste grapes. I usually prefer to determine whether milk or food in the refrigerator is fresh by smell rather than reading the expiration date.\n* I can go back somewhere after being away for years and negotiate the streets effortlessly. However, if some key feature has been changed, I get confused and lost. I navigate by landmarks or objects, never street names.\n* I visit my daughter every week. One day I drove past her street. I had to turn around and go back. For ten years, without knowing it, I knew where to turn because of a mailbox on the comer that was made from an old stove. When it was removed, I just drove right by her street without realizing it.\n* In a restaurant, it’s difficult to order from reading the menu. I often order based upon seeing or smelling food from another table: “I’ll have what that guy is having.”\n* After an exercise involving the use of apples, the virtually identical apples were collected and mixed together. A man with a preference for Extraverted Sensing was able to instantly pick out not only his apple but those of the people on either side of him as well.\n* At a wedding, I could not eat for fear that I might miss something. I had to be up walking around and talking to people. I only knew four people when I arrived. By the end of the reception, I knew almost everyone. I was even invited back to the house with the family, for the opening of the presents.\n\n**GIFTS**\n\n**Unique strengths of Extraverted Sensing**\n\n* Accurate, objective, and detailed observation of a wide range of experiences in the current environment\n* Enjoyment of life\n* Can see all sides of an issue\n* An aptitude for hands-on work\n* Extremely reliable visual perception\n* A talent for teaching others, by example, to smell the roses\n* A knack for bringing excitement and life to any group\n* Realism and practicality

2	ISFP here... WOW, if the mbti tests had had the paraphrasing and "Scenes from the world of Extraverted Sensing" it would have made it so much easier to understand! i can relate to so many of these :D and when i'm shopping i kind of go around "tasting" each food in my mouth to see whether i want it or not. (are the tomatoes a Se thing or was that an example ahaha, because i hate them)
2	Is Dave Franco an ESTP?	
1	his character from nerve, which judging by your username you're a fan of, is probably an ESTP or maybe ENTP, but that's just me being optimistic. Vee is an INFJ, the guy played by Machine Gun Kelley is an ESTP or ESFP, and the chick who flashes everybody at the beginning is an ESFP. The annoying nerd guy is probably an ENFJ or ESFJ.
4	Ambiguous relationships - do you like to know even if it's 'pointless'?	Would you want to know if your romantic interest was reciprocated, even if a relationship was nigh impossible in the short term?\n\nContext: ESTP (Enneagram 8) x me - mutual interest, and flirting (sort of - more like extra attention/kindness/respect and protectiveness from him and awkwardness from me) but never openly acknowledged; he moved to a different state and we didn't communicate for a year and a half -we didn't know each other very well, mostly just had mutual friends. I thought it'd be dead by the time he came back to visit, but he still seemed interested, only I didn't see the point in reciprocating since he'd be going back to his new state. I was rather put on the spot when he visited though and having thought it through I wonder about his intentions since he did seem to have interest in an actual relationship (not just flirting for the sake of it), but he pursued me both times in full knowledge that he was moving. I do want the relationship to happen, but I don't see how it'd be feasible, for at least another few years if he moves back after college. I don't want a long-distance relationship when I haven't been able to get to know him irl beforehand, we seem so different I think we'd need that basis.\n\nSO the point being, is it a good idea to tell him straight up that I like him even though a relationship would be logistically difficult at best? Do you ESTPs like to know stuff like that, or does it seem manipulative (it's not meant to be, I'd just like to get it off my chest, and if he /is/ really keen it might be good for both of us)? Is it too late? :P
1	I wish this got answered 
5	Where did everybody go?	Long time ESTP, new subscriber, how many of us are active on this sub reddit?
9	ENFP here, I get the impression that you ESTPs are too busy doing all the fun and dangerous things to come and theorize about your personalities.
4	All of us ESTP's could care less about Myers Briggs. We are out side living our lives.
2	Maybe start threads about things that you enjoy?  I'm pretty sure threads don't *have* to be psychology-oriented.  Maybe you'll attract more ESTPs here.\n\nI dunno – it's a place to start / something to try.  I honestly couldn't attest to its effectiveness though.
1	I see a post once in a while. Not much traffic
1	Just like ESFJs, more out there in the world instead of in this virtual world. Which is a GOOD thing in my opinion.
1	Semi-lurker, agreed with other posters, ESTP's aren't generally the type for theoretical discussions.
0	Why arent all ESTP's good at the same thing?	For example, me and my friend are both ESTP's but for some reason, it seems like we werent blessed with the same skillsets. He is very good at seducing women for some odd reason , (I think maybe its solely on his looks) while I'm just average. But I'm better at charming people and a better leader than he is. Whenever he tries to lead something,he does ok but it dissipates very quickly whether its group, campaign or small businesss, but me on the other hand I'm very good with all those things. Is there a reason why were good at different things? nnecaus eI find it a bit odd.. and yes I am positive we are both ESTP's,... he also took the test.

5	People are not robots off a production line. So there's individual variation. Mbti doesn't have any way to account for personal experiences.\n\n> Is there a reason why were good at different things?\n\nYou *are* different people. What did you expect?\n\nI reckon it takes about 6 months of daily practise to get competent at guitar. Good enough to sing a song and play the chords. This is from total noob to playing and singing. 6 months should do it.\n\nIf one of you did that and the other didn't you'd consider it a difference of personality?\n\nOr a difference of focus.
2	IDK. Why do people think ESTP gives themselves free reign to act like a [douche-caboose](https://www.reddit.com/r/istp/comments/4pevac/clashes_with_istps/)?   
2	There's only 16 types in the whole world; imagine only having 16 different types of skill sets... no
2	I don't know what your talking about but I'm good at everything.
1	MBTI isn't everything, for example with your friend other woman can find his personality just more attractive, also his facial features. And the thing about being leaders you probably are more focused then he is,it might also be a more developed Ti internal thinking.
3	What are you like in a romantic relationship and how do you view your partner(s)?	Interpret however
3	What do you want to know, specifically? It depends on the partner. The more patience and malleability in thought and humor the better. Do you need a breakdown of what I found to be admirable traits in multi-year relationships past and present? \n\nJudging from your post history, you're female. My perspective might not be tailored to your needs. I'm not sure if the menfolk here will give you the courtesy of obliging in explicit detail. If you're expecting some long-winded, tearfully-framed expulsion of an ethereal sonnet, whether it be from a male or female ESTP, you're not going to get it. Jokes, touch, inviting you along for the ride and, if you are highly regarded platonically or romantically, protectiveness.      
4	random survey! all types welcome especially exSP	
10	My catchphrase is pretty much: "Go fuck yourself." Lol. From what people tell me, we're assertive.	
3	Lol I can be very mean , especially when my friend is acting like a pussy. Then my female friends are like "that's so rude :( " but the other guy friends completely understand where I'm coming from

1	I'm married to one, his is "s2bu" (sucks to be you).  He's a massive, lovable cock.
1	As an ENFP, I fucking love the bluntness. Sure i've been criticized by an ESTP here and there, but I justify it by analyzing the root cause of why you guys would use the bluntness for a certain situation, deeming it beneficial.

2	Smart, funny exhibitionists who let them do the driving, ime.  They'll call the number that says, "for a good time call _______" just to check it out. ;) You can totally meet one at a swinger's party, or any kind of big festival.  Or skiing.  Dress hot but not high maintenance and don't play games: jump them when their blood is up or they'll move on.  They're not exactly sitting home alone all day waiting for Ms. Right, but Ms. Right Now isn't getting any judgment for being forward or fast.  Do not be a sourpuss, that's key.
2	Just broke up with a girl because, although very good-looking, grounded and a bright future, she was *too damn boring*. She didn't seem to have much of a personality. She didn't challenge me, never really wanted to do exciting things, never gave me butterflies, never took risks. You should really embrace the idea of doing & action to appeal to an ESTP guy. This doesn't mean you have to want to go for an adventurous hike or something every day, but just be seeking out new things and be challenging your partner. That's the biggest thing for me.
1	I'm guessing your girl.
3	Thought you guys might find this interesting	
1	It is pretty interesting!\n\n...but I dunno how I feel about sticking stuff up my ass
0	ESTP men: is this accurate?	Which of these points do you relate to and think is true for ESTP men?\n\nI've found some effective ways in seducing the ESTP male. Here are some observations: \n\n1. Always let him plan the date. ESTP men are intimidated by women who seemingly like to take control of situations. They rather direct activities, so only suggest things to do, then let him take credit for it. He'll feel confident and in-control and won't feel resentful that you're \n"leading" the relationship. In essence, you are "guiding" him to do things you'd rather do, which you are letting him take the credit for. \n\n2. Always talk out his feelings with the ESTP male. He doesn't want an intellectual equal or a woman is knowledgable on a variety of subjects nor an intellectual sparring partner. He wants someone who listens to his problems and gives him emotional support. Aside from talking about his problems and feelings with him, laugh and giggle at all his jokes. He's feel confident and in-control. \n\n3. Aside from talking about the ESTP's problems and acting as his personal therapist, remember that the ESTP male loves to talk about sex. Primarily discuss all the sexual things he'd like to do and talk about all his sexual fantasies with him. He'll appreciate all the time you pay attention to trying to fulfill his sexual needs cos it will make him feel confident and in-control. \n\n4. ESTPs love exploring and adventure, however they prefer predictability in their partners. Always be on call when he calls; immediately pick up the phone and answer him right away. When he calls, make sure to only talk about him and don't mention any of the things you are doing or working on. Be doubly sure you don't talk about other people to him. ESTPs love being the center of attention, and they prefer that they are the only star in the shining star and will feel resentful if there are other people whom he sees as competition.\n\n5. ESTPs also like being dominated in bed. Make sure you throw him around and be a little rough with him. He likes to be the boss outside the bedroom, but in the bedroom, the ESTP male is actually a submissive guy who likes to be pushed around and made to feel a little pain before the orgasmic ending. \n\n6. Don't try to help the ESTP in matters outside of being a good ear to his emotional problems. The ESTP rather you stay out of his professional life because he is the one who wants to be seen as helping others. Instead play damsel-in-distress. Learn to say things like, "Oh, ESTP male....[sniff sniff] What should I do?" He can then run to your side to help you which will make him feel confident and in-control.\n\n7. Never be direct or say what's really on your mind with the ESTP male. Instead be unassuming, quiet and say things in a way in which you never truly express your real thoughts or opinions. Opinionated women irritate the ESTP male- especially if you have a conflicting opinion to his world view. Instead, agree with him gently but then make a few additions such as "You're so right, ESTP male, and do you also think that it could be true that A=B? What is your opinion on this?" That way, it will give the ESTP male to talk about his thoughts, his opinions, his observations without you interjecting with what he wants to see. \n\nRemember, the main goal of the ESTP male is to feel confident and in-control. Any time there is something in the environment which points to the opposite will make him feel resentful of you. The point is to make him feel as comfortable as possible, and then seduce him. He'll think in the end, that he seduced you instead!\n
9	LOL who wrote this crap?! 
2	I'm not sure if my input is what you want, but this seems to be reinforcing the reputation of ESTP men as knuckle dragging neanderthals.  \n\nOn a platonic level, they and ISTPs, are the ones you can easily shed any semblance or pretense of being "ladylike" without being judged or scrutinized for yukking it up along with them. 
2	I disagree with 7, the reason I love him is I can be myself 100% and not put on an act.  I mean he might like butt-kissing bullshit for all I know (I seriously doubt it, since he sees through games immediately) but he really doesn't give a shit about either of us conforming to a social role.\n\nBasically, be who you are, and if you like him and yourself and you're basically good-hearted and fun, the sexual chemistry is really the important thing if you're hoping for a relationship.  Negative, controlling nitpickers hate them, so that level of incompatibility is unlikely to come up very often.

1	Not accurate.  
1	I can't speak for other ESTP's, but these are all inaccurate in my case. ESPECIALLY 5......I'm the dominant one
1	Who would want a girlfriend that is a pushover? Not me, a headstrong girl that bites back will get me everytime. I need someone to challenge my ideas rather than just go along with them, cause God knows that 60% of my ideas are bad....\n
0	Totally insecure females that constantly think every encounter with women can result in cheating.  
2	have any of you ESTP females dated an INFJ male?	how did it go? give as much info as you can!
4	I hate to leave you hanging, and I certainly hope someone can come in for the assist. In retrospect, I'm positive that my first boyfriend was INTJ, second ENTP and my husband is XSTJ. I'm not sure if I could possibly help, since I don't think I've ever had a significant romantic relationship with an F. \n\nWhat I will say is, when I read through some of these threads, it makes me thankful that I was introduced to MBTI at age twenty-eight rather than eighteen. It seems like some people entrench themselves in the caricatures detailed here, and the overall population might be on the younger side. Maybe roll the dice a little?

1	i didn't date one but i did have a no strings situation with one and it was an utter nightmare afterwards. he painted me out to be such a monster for not having feelings for him and he questioned if i was even a human being. he believed in things that i found laughable. he was too idealistic for my liking. i was blinded by how good the sex was. i never respected him as a person. 
3	ESTP Male & ESTJ Female	Im and estp and my ex is an estj. Recently she calls me  just to see how I am doing and stuff. Then she begins to act really affectionate towards me and tells me how she's sorry for everything she has done to me. Long story short, I think she wants to get back together with me because shes calling me "babe" and sending "I miss you" texts whenever I dont respond. We broke up over 3 years ago and she said she hasnt been in a relationship in over a year, and to top it all off she keep sasking if I'm seeing anyone, and I'm trying to change the sbject on that ;). I really do like her but I feel like I cant trust her, at all. She was "the big one" if you know what I mean and it makes me feel like she wants to make me her rebound after her last breakup. Can she be trusted? Is she just using me? Answers please!
2	These type of questions I feel shouldn't be based upon the personality types. Even though the personality type can have an effect or explain her behaviour, you as a person will know her better than what her description might follow. \n\nFrom a female's perspective she definitely wants to get back together, however if you feel like you can't trust her then don't go for it. If her breakup was over a year ago, you probably aren't a rebound exactly but may seem like an easy solution for her loneliness. 
1	Ask people that know her.
1	There are two issues here to concern yourself with.\n\n1. Nostalgia is a powerful emotion and that could be what she is feeling. Probably the point she is missing is that she is wistfully looking at a version of you that is 3 years out of date.\n\n2. Trust is an incredibly difficult thing to regain.  I'm in a similar circumstance.  Even though a section of me knows we clicked on every level, I don't trust her any longer.  And there isn't anything I can envision that she can do to get that trust back. 
1	I agree this doesn't sound like an ESTJ thing but a person thing. And yeah it sounds like a rebound. Could still work out. Just know you're a rebound.
1	Actually by reading your post I feel like you already know the answer man. \nIt's very hard to understand who an ESTP & ESTJ can get together as ESTJ are all about law, order and security, which we find boring as for us: "there are no rules". \nBUT if you really loved her and that she was "the big one", I would definitely suggest to think really hard about some simple questions:\n- Why did you guys break up in the first place? \n- Who broke it up ? \n- Are you happy now? \n- Do you think you would be happy-ier if you were to get back together? \n- Has she changed or have you changed? \n\nKeep in mind that knowing that ESTJ value order and security before anything else, maybe she's confuse after her break up and she's trying to rely on something that felt "familiar" to her which is you/your relationship.\nAnyway, I hope you find peace and whatever you decide, you do it for you and for your happiness, life is short, let's live it to the fullest and not waste too much time on dwelling on the past ;)
7	How should i tell the difference between ESTP and ISTP? : [cross post /r/istp]	
2	interesting
8	Other ESTPS, need some advice!	Hey there, I'm a strong ESTP in college and I am really struggling to stay focused and pass classes. Everyone else just sees it as lazy, which I totally understand but its the routine that is making me crazy. I feel completely down all the time now. Need some advice on sticking it out and finding ways to feel in-the-moment again! I love negotiating and tangible results but college gives me zero opportunities to feel like I'm getting anything done. Any other ESTPs struggle in college?
4	Look at the competition around you. The challenge is to beat as many as possible. I cannot stress this enough that it needs to be approached like a game of "[fuck off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36KF72071gQ)".\n\nAlso you're going to need to get into the habit of finding your work ability. What do i mean? You can work for how many hours before you hate life? Don't take loads of breaks... you set out to have maybe 5 hours of work and you can break in the middle for whatever it takes to get back on it mentally.\n\nWhat do you do to lift yourself up?\n\nIf you don't lift up and refuel your Se then you'll eventually just hate studying. So when you sit down to study just reiterate a few times in your head... "it's only for a while and when we're finished here we never have to do this shiht again".\n\nCos that's the goal. Get the qualification and use it. Preferably not studying.\n\nBut while you are still studying ... manage your Se and feed it responsibly (i.e. don't feed it with party when you've got shit due).\n\nIt takes maturity to keep yourself happy and study. It's a challenge. But the flip side is that it gets easier the more you do.\n\n> I feel completely down all the time now.\n\nYou are feeling to urge to find a new thing to refuel that Se. That's what slows you down. But feed it responsibly, right. You can't be bored and you need to lift that tension.\n\n2 hours of work 1 hour of [practise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J5HCAf61N0) or [practise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCt1bmSASCI) and regain that focus that you're talking about. It needs a happy Se to work [properly](http://www.wimp.com/the-greatest-hacky-sack-routine-of-all-time/). I actually dance a lot because i like music. I don't care if someone see's me dancing away my sexy body.\n\n> Need some advice on sticking it out and finding ways to feel in-the-moment again!\n\nPeople always gave me a pep talk. It doesn't work tho. This is easily discarded theory. No it's about managing your Se. Find things that you can do to really get back into thhat good place... these things need to be fairly brief distractions.\n\nWhen you are working you will build up some bank. That bank is valuable to you even if it's a bit painful.\n\nAlso exercise is great for getting me refocused. I'll come home from work most days and get back into happy mode by listening to music and doing a few pressups and situps. It just makes me happier.\n\nCos i'm a beast (who apparantly is compelled to edit typos.
2	By the way don't do those things i linked you if they're frustrating.\n\nFind something you like and can practise. Change it if it gets tired.\n\nChange it if you get obsessed with it to the detriment of study.\n\nDon't play a lot of video games. Go out if you're gonna waste the day.
1	Does your college put you together with folks from your cohort in your major? I made good friends with some other extroverted biology types when I was in school, and we would *study* (read: 50% study, 50% chat and party) for hours together. Kept me appropriately focused when I had to but also made me feel like I wasn't just brain-stressing when I WAS working on things.\n\nAnother thing that really helped me was tutoring and assistant-teaching in basic level courses to keep my brain strong in the fundamentals, cause I have a tendancy to cram and then brain-dump after exams. Repetition, repetition, repetition, as much as we hate it. \n\nI also made a lot of really funny and filthy word-tricks to remember vocabulary and concepts. Something about making them interesting with foul humor or curse words made them stick better. \n\nAlso, don't lose track of the fact that ESTPs can often be kinetic learners. Draw pictures or schematics of what you're studying, bounce a ball, anything to engage that need for movement or fidgeting while you study. 
1	You will probably flunk out minus the basics.  Things are easy for you.  However, you will focus on getting laid and mowing down losers.  
1	May I ask what you're majoring in? Are you surrounding yourself with people who might be a negative influence and goading on indulgences? I found that studying in a group kept me more disciplined and focused. \n\nI lost my scholarship after my first year in college. Not that I would unjustly lay complete responsibility on the people I was surrounding myself with, but they were a catalyst for bad behaviors. Once I returned to healthier socialization via clubs and intermurals, I had a more positive network to lean upon and dole out the much needed discipline that I was severely lacking.

2	ESTP male & ENFP chick....	wow we need more ESTP's on reddit...anyways, this ENFP girl I'm friends with seems to be really into me one day, and the next day shes not. We talk about alot of stuff and we spend a lot of time together, even staying up until 4 am just chit chatting. I dont mind doing all this stuff, but if its just to be friends... I wont waste my time. So the other day I told her that shes very important to me and she just says "hahaha why am I important to you?" ..I'm like wtf man, I was expecting her to be so happy that I considered her special and stuff but instead I get that crap so I responded "Why you dont wanna be?" and she says "Of course I do, but I just dont see how or why I am"... Is she stupid? We spent lots of time together, I mean alot, and we've had sexual encounters and  stuff like WTF. At this point of the convo I was stunned so I used my ESTP powers and talked my way ut of it and basically called her a good friend. I'm not going to answer anymore of her texts until I find a solution. She's kind of a big flirt, almost even slutty, but with me it seems she really does like me.. is she just playing me? Please help. BTW: She's part of a social circle I organize, I dont want any awkwardness..., oh and i also asked the enfp forum, they werent much help
5	Fi wants to know why it's special.
4	Dude, don't even. ESTP and ENFP relationships are hopeless. \n\nYou both might have a lot in common at first. After all, you can both be described as impulsive, fun-loving, charmers who are kids at heart. Always up for the ups in life and you are both people-oriented person, life of party blablabla. \nBUT you both have different ways of communicating and expressing things/emotions. \nShe's asking you "why am I important to you", which is pretty obvious to you because you show it by actions (spending time with her, doing things together), but she needs a lot of positive affirmations that will not only come by actions but by words, by feelings. \nThe worst is you are very much a realist, so when you try to communicate, you use facts and rational thinking. So whenever you will say something that you judge honest and true, you might be "too blunt" (that tend to happen a lot with us) and she might (certainly) take it as a criticism. And if there's one thing ENFP hates, it's criticism! The comment might come across as a personal attack against her personal beliefs or identity. \n\nOn another hand , she will be focus more on exploring ideas and possibilities, that why you having the feeling that she's "playing hot and cold". ENFP are just like that, they are a living contradiction living with a "the grass is greener elsewhere" effect in their mind and always seeking for freedom. \nYou also seek for freedom and fun and liberty, but when you're into someone or want something, you want it NOW. \nYou guys have different core values and way of understanding things, she will find you too bossy and you will find her too delusional or erratic. And you both will too often misinterpreted what the other says.\n\nSo my advice would be to what you do best: just have fun! Don't get too "intense" like ESTPs tend to be when they are into something or someone . Don't get sucked in and start overthinking the whole thing, because you don't understand why is she not just straight forward with you and if she likes you why she just doesn't say so or act accordingly and consistently. Will mess up with your mind. \nGood luck bro!
3	ENFP here. Not sure how her tone sounded but I don't understand why her question offended you. It sounds like you guys were fwb at the time and she saw you two as just that. So when you decided to tell her she's special she wanted to know why. If she's special since of  her personality, (she's been there for you or something) then just say it. It sounds like you're applying value to a simple question. \nShe didn't deny it.\n\nIf you want to know if she's serious or not just ask. ENFPs are usually straightforward. It'll be a better answer than random strangers deducing from the limited info we know about her.\n\nI asked an ESTP who was interested in me the same question. He basically said because I looked good. His response let me know he probably didn't want something serious. She may want to know if you want to become serious or not. Like before, just ask her and don't beat around.
1	what would an estp 5w6 look like?	My close friend identifies with both estp and enneagram type 5 which I have not seen before. I'm not sure if it's uncommon overall or just uncommon to me but I really want to know how estp 5s appear and think like. Thanks!
1	I just took the enneagram test and scored high on type 5 and 7. I'm not sure if it's uncommon or not but feel free to ask me any questions!\n\nEdit: I retook the test on a different website and scored 4 and 7. Type 5 was at the end of the list lol.
1	lol enneagram 5 estp.... they would look like an ISTP
1	Estp type 5 may mature up faster and self reflect than the rest. They wouldnt talk about topic they dont know about to some degree. Values intelligence, courage, and honesty ALOT.  \n\nSometimes is loner\nMight try to slove their recklessness and use it in efficient way.\nDevelop slowly in Fe
1	Enneagram Test	The Enneagram is a very popular personality test related to the MBTI, Based on the same theory, MBTI shows how you get information, the Enneagram shows how you use it? \n\nWondering if any of you have taken it what did you get? i am a 8w7
2	I ussually get enneagram 3, seems accurate
1	i got a 7\n\nedit didn't remember the subtype
1	7/8 depending on the test
5	ESTP girl I like	(Background: we're both in college and neither of us have ever been in a relationship) \n\nI'am an ENFP (sometimes esfp) guy and I'm having nonstop thoughts about my ESTP friend (female).\n\nWhen I first met her through a friend I thought she was fairly attractive and carried herself in a fun way, which was cool because I'm all about fun and what not; anyways, every time we hung out drunk we would end up hooking up with each other in club/party/kick back type situations, however one time was different from the rest.\n\nIt happened when she hosted a little party for our friend that was studying abroad. While we were hooking up in her bedroom she was saying, "I'am normally not like this" as well as "I normally don't have guys like this in my room". The day after I realized that I was fairly attracted to her so I asked her if she wanted to hang out some other time and well she basically responded by saying, "I don't hang out with guys in public" "it's not me, it's not what I do" in which me being the little ENFP that I'am responded saying "whaaaa what why not"?. She repeated her self but I replied back with a couple jokes on the topic that made her laugh because I wanted to lighten up her mood, and well, from that day on......we became FRIENDS!\n\nAs weeks and months passed by out friendship grew stronger. She started coming to me to talk about problems and we would spend a lot of time hanging out together alone, and even in public haha, however, as more and more time started to pass by hooking up between her and I started to disappear and in return we kinda became best friends in a way. \n\nThe thing is, I haven't made a move on her in a while just because I've been enjoying her compony and getting to know her as a person. (I think ESTP's are the coolest personality types because if they truly care for you they'll show you a part of them that NO ONE or a select few will ever see) But it has kind of dragged on too long in my mind. \n\nLike I personally want to make a move again but I'am just so scared of destroying our friendship since we haven't hooked up in awhile; I don't want to come off on the wrong foot. Also, if I haven't shown it, I have feelings her...and having some feelings in return would be cool too, so how can I tell that she has feelings for me? and what do I do to win her and fix up my mess that I made?\n\nThanks so much you guys! \n\nBtw, something I forgot to put in the post was that there was a gap where we stopped talking because the only form of communication was through my friend at the time or just us talking over text. Anyways because me and the ESTP would only text, the ESTP would frequently ask my friend when she'll bring me over or when she'll be able to hang out and see me again.
3	Yeah okay, i have something to say about this dynamic.\n\nThe ESTP withdrew from intimacy because they do not want to feel heartache. It was great when there were no consequences... but you can only hook up so many times before someone starts to have feelings. Essentially, this is the relationship cock-blocker. You can't fight against that either or you'll push the ESTP further away. \n\nThe ESTP has a very accurate sense of your emotional availability and *in all honesty* you guys will probably not hook up again until you drop the expectation back down to zero. That's kinda the reason why you got friend-zoned here. You represent a threat to the ESTPs individuality and freedom.\n\n*It has nothing to do with how you match-up or being a good enough fit.*\n\nYou must understand that you are trying to exert control over the ESTP. You'll never admit it because you are ENFP and i know that you (frequently) don't acknowledge your own agenda. Such is the nature of Ne-Fi.\n\nMy advice to you is to take the hint; Withdraw a little yourself. If you can't do that the ESTP won't trust you to get closer. It's basically the one thing you need to realise. Don't cage an ESTP. We'll reject you completely if you represent more limitation than freedom. And you can't offer us freedom like a carrot of a stick to put us in a cage because we're too perceptive for that trick.\n\nAlso it has absolutely nothing to do with "there's something wrong with you". It's not about that at all. You have different agendas and it needs to be acknowledged. The ESTP has an agenda for fun. You have an agenda for a relationship. You probably find it hard to believe that anyone could *not* be looking for a relationship and yet still be intimate... well... i can assure you that the ESTP is not secretly thinking about a long term relationship.\n\nThey are not playing hard to get.\n\nThis is pretty much why my last relationship crumbled. Except is was reversed in gender. Anyway, the ENFP girl i was dating couldn't help herself but emotionally tie me down and that makes me anxious... eventually she took it very personally when something wasn't reciprocated and got all hurt and told me to go fuck myself.\n\nDo you see the anxiety that your ESTP friend expressed the last time you guys were hooking up? "This isn't me..." etc... The only time a ESTP feels like they have lost control is through anxiety.\n\nThat's because you got too close.\n\nIf you really want to have a relationship with this person you need to be able to let her go. Does that sound like the hardest thing ever? Well let me tell you... that is because your agendas don't line up.
1	Yeaaah... Forget about her, she's just not into you. She might enjoy your company but you will never win her heart. Chances are she already has someone in mind / she is seeing someone but hasn't told anyone yet.
5	Feeling pretty damn lost	It's probably more of my age than anything (I'm 21, F) but I can't make up my mind on anything. I start a project and stop in an hour because I get bored. I've changed my major more times than I can count and I can't seem to find a career I'm interested in. I've probably changed my mind on what I want to do every week. How can I take the next step in my life if I can't figure out what I want to do? I'm pretty stuck right now and it seems like the only thing that makes me happy is going out and partying which has become slightly dangerous recently. I want to take a step back but I become very depressed when I'm not in a social setting. I've also realized this past month how sensitive I am toward everything. I had to stop watching a silly cartoon because I felt too bad for a character in it which is pretty silly. Any other ESTP feeling the same way? I'm not sure if I've clearly stated about how I'm feeling.. pretty bad at explaining my thoughts (which I think most ESTP's can relate to lol)
7	Here's what i learned. The whole world needs to be treated like a competition.\n\nEverybody knows that the reason why people chose a subject is so that they can specialize. It make you more valuable in any given field if you are the best at doing what you do, obviously. But ESTP doesn't like long term comitments - feels like a cage, right?\n\nThe advice i was given is to treat that comitment like a challenge. Be better than other people at getting the thing done. And then it is yours. Work hard and then play hard.\n\nThis is how ESTP can excel despite wanting absolute freedom. You better understand the path to that freedom.

2	Hey girl, 23 F still in college and I can totally relate. Luckily, I found a major I liked right away (international affairs) but I am constantly failing classes because I get bored. I hate the pointless routine! And bored means depressed, so I look for ways to get happy too. Try not to over do it on the party scene, I've been there. Try to make plans with new people too, college is like a playground for us because there are so many new people to talk to. Sometimes it helps avoid the depression. Also at some point just realize all majors have opportunities to be both boring and interesting, nothing is always going to be 100% great so just pick one you like and commit! Chances are it wont be what you end up doing for a living anyway.\n
1	Haha I can totally relate. \nActually I answered another thread about what would you like to improve" and getting bored too easily was it\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4lip7u/what_would_you_like_to_improve_if_you_could/\n\nActually I was super bored at school and didn't do great at academics, not because I'm not smart, on the contrary, ESTPs are known to be sharp, but just because I was so bored all the time. \nConcepts, theories and else bore us like hell. I would rather go out and try to apply what the teacher is saying than sitting in class and listening. Because the lecturing approach of formal education is so unappealing, I would suggest to try and focus on major/subject that you can practice with a lot of hands on. Learning things that you can apply in the reality of your present moment. \n\nAs for the partying and the going out, it's normal, you feel alive when you're outside and with people. That's how "you recharge" emotionally speaking, even if physically speaking it might be a bit borderline if you abuse it. What I learned over the years, is that I'm know satisfy with just hanging out with a small group of friends that I really care about, I don't need to go to huge parties every day of the week no to recharge. I can just chill with beers and talk and mess around with my friends and it makes me happy and emotionally satisfy. Of course, we do go out all together and go crazy from time to time (I'm often the initiator of that btw). \n\nMy advice, would definitely to find a balance between going out (movies, watching a concert, sports, restaurants, bars) with your friends and not spending "too much" time alone because that's when you start thinking and having all these sensitivity coming up. 
1	estj vs infp	I have had a relationship with an ESTJ for 4 years now. we have very little trouble together. I was wondering if there are any others that have had this relationship work.\nWhen I look at it on paper it doesn't seem like it should.
3	I think you meant to post in /r/estj 
1	I agree that I think you probably meant to post this on /r/estj   ... however when it comes to thinking about compatibility with personalities, I really don't think you should approach it as "oh I'm XXXX they are XXXX it says we won't click so this shouldn't happen.." everyone is different and some people have really developed their cognitive functions that may be a weak spot for them initially. In my opinion, if the relationship is going, and going well, keep at it! Personality test only tell x amount of person, barely scraping the surface. I REALLY don't think you should base being with someone just off what some test says their personality is. A relationship, a good one, is about great communication, liking the person, accepting them, etc... TL;DR : don't try to base what relationships should be off of personality test measures -- personal experience
1	Why did you think it wouldn't work on paper? ... You share all of the same functions. That means communication should be very good. That's practically all it takes for a healthy relationship.\n\nBrief lesson on duality pairs...\n\nESTJ; Te, Si, Ne, Fi\n\nINFP; Fi, Ne, Si, Te\n\nTake a moment to look at the functions listed above... Take either one of those function stacks and reverse it. Then compare it to the other. You share the same functions. But your strengths are his weaknesses and vice versa. This is how MBTI says 'opposites attract' ... it really doesn't mean total opposites but complimentary opposites.\n\nNeither of you are using Se, Ti, Fe, Ni (these are all the functions i use).\n\nIt's called a duality pair. It is meant to be a good match on paper because you compliment each other completely. There is nothing to conflict.
1	estj will eat infp alive, if you survive that there's nothing than can get you
1	ESTJs and INFPs are polar opposites in all ways. I can't see it lasting past the honeymoon stage...you will get extremely frustrated with the INFP, they in return will probably think you are an insensitive jerk. You never know though...
1	Not sure why this is in /r/estp but as an INFP in a happy 1 year relationship with an ESTJ, I'm glad to see your post. Like you, we also have little trouble together. \n\nWhat trouble there is is mainly due to us being semi-long distance, and well... I want to see, talk and be close to him more than he sees the need to, he's usually focused on work when apart. But recently, he admitted he loved me, so I feel much more secure about our relationship and thus seek out his attention less. \n\nWe understand each other easily because we share the same values. Not exactly the same interests or goals, but the underlying attitude toward things. He still speaks in a concrete ST way and I still speak in a vague and personal NF way, so that can leave us scratching our heads or having to repeat things. But it's not the kind of conflict that would be a wtf moment. And somehow when he speaks, I feel as if I can trust him implicitly. 
4	Can I pick your clever brains for a moment, /r/ESTP?	I'm starting up a moving business and need a catchy, clever name.  I'm thinking something along the lines of "Moving on Up" or "Let's Get Moving", but those are already taken.  \n\nAny suggestions?
9	Moving furnture and belongings?\n\nHome zone. Professional movers.\n\nYou want to avoid any negative connotation that may be immplied by sarcastic interpretations or deliberate 'false' reading of the name or phrase.\n\nWhat do you want to promote? You make things easy for people, you're quick, neat, and professional. Careful. Cost effective. You can speak to a consumers ideals if you can reference their mindset...\n\nA2B Move - professional transportation\n\nREARRANGE!\n\nSmart Move\n\niMove 4u\n\nJust Move It (with a rip off Nike tick)\n\nCheesy works if it avoids any possible sarcastic intepretation. I made puns about phones toward the end because it speaks more to a consumer lifestyle rather than directly about moving. It conveys comfort and associates a level of service. I also chose to promote a high energy aesthetic with word choice or format.

0	To change the face of human psychology completely…	\n\nPsychic mediumship and telepathy is expressed throughout pop culture. What this means is that other human beings are expressing their observations about reality through art. Art is a powerful medium which can heighten awareness in other individuals very quickly. Artists take their own life experiences and inner realities and display them for the public to see. Awareness of ESP is expressed over and over and over again in the artistic world. It's time to own up to the truth and be real: we are all psychic. Telepathy is real, and it should be used well (with kindness). We are all psychic mediums, and when we believe in ourselves, we can connect with the spirit world directly telepathically. We don't need religions, other psychics, or authority figures to tell us what reality is. We have our own observations, and when we open our minds to new information, more confirming experiences about the truth of reality. There is no death. There is a difference between being extremely confident in our observations and expressing this confidence to other people, and being authoritative. Think for yourself. Question authority.

2	I really like your username ... but i wish you would have engaged the debate by replying to the comments of the last thread you posted rather than ignore my input on your previous [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/estp/comments/4eucht/nothing_invites_attacks_from_others_like_a_good/d247bnn).\n\nWhat you have done here is called spam.\n\nIf you ignore the audience you are posting to then you're not really posting here to have a discussion but rather just to whitewash. In which case, yes, i would support moderation of your posts.
6	a question for the ESTP females	what are you like?
4	Brassy, loud, entertaining, and joyful. Very project-oriented. I tend to bite off more than I can chew sometimes. I like to live in the moment when it comes to socializing but I can be a long-term thinker when it comes to organization and life-goals. \n\nI'm not sensitive. Snarky, welcoming of criticism but quick to brush off adversary. I don't hold things against people or hold grudges but I do tend to predict behaviors based on history--I just learn to work around it. I make judgments based on how the world (and people) work, but I don't blame them for being the way they are. \n\n Let me know if you have more questions. 
2	Quiet, kind (been told SO many times) funny, loud with close friends and family. 99.92% reckless but always fix it. intelligent (people mostly surprised) clumsy/goofy
1	[deleted]
1	ESTP male here, ex was an ESTP...... they are annoying as hell but great in bed
1	I consider myself chill although my friends tell me I'm pretty intense. \nI'm full of energy, always up for the party or adventures or just something new. My friends will always be about "chill beers" when I'll be ordering tequila shots. \n\nI'm very open minded, have a very unique perception of morality. \n\nI'm kinda of a rule breaker, but only actually break rules when rules come in the way of what i want or what I need to do to get what I want. I don't just break rules for the fun of it. \n\nVery rational, a bit too blunt in the way I say things, people says that I can be mean, but I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just trying to be honest here ! \n\nIn relationship will always go for what I can't have, because having what I can have is way too easy, and where's the fun in that right? \n
1	I dont give any fucks like at all super realistic and rational though 
2	TheRedPill	I was wondering for those of you that aware of it, what are your opinions on /r/theredpill 
11	Well basically they mean well but are selfish assholes about the way they try to support weak minded fools.\n\n50% self help 50% pure poison
9	I personally find it sickening. There's so much hate, it's basically a guide to becoming a psychopath. Sure, if you want results with women it might get you there, but you'll become a complete jerk in the process. 
10	Yeah. That place is a joke.
8	Im a fan of it. People in the 16-22 age range tend to not be. But you are older and more experienced and have seen divorces, cheating, branch-swinging, cognitive dissonance, ingroup bias, preselection bias, etc.... then you might enjoy it\n\nI was a virgin at 19 and would have rejected theredpill's ideas. But by age 25 Id had many relationships and slept with 50 or so women, and you do start noticing patterns and differences between women and men. \n\nMy friends who are in sales would have no problem with TRP and would agree with nearly all of it. My friends in software (who also are liberal / guardian readers) would totally reject it and see it as hate speech and something that should be banned\n\nOne of the main lessons that theredpill tries to teach is that what women want in a man and what they say they want can be total opposites. That can be hard to believe at first for many guys
1	Help Understanding an ESTP	About a year ago, I had a relationship with an ESTP in one of my classes, and it went great, for me at least. He broke up with me after two months because he had too much going on in his life, and I made my peace with that fairly quickly (though I'll admit at the time I thought he had just gotten tired of me). Recently he and I have reconnected, and I don't understand him as well as I used to. I think he likes me, but I'm not sure. I was the one that reached out to him originally through text, but he was the one who continued to make effort to start conversations after that. Even though he starts the conversations, though, he doesn't really contribute much to them after the initial "Hey". I usually have to be the one to keep them moving, otherwise there are lulls. That happened a little bit when we were dating, but for the most part we used to be able to talk for hours, contributing equally to the conversation. Now, I feel like I have to make more effort just to keep it from fizzling out. So, what are the signs when an ESTP DOESN'T like someone, or isn't interested in them? What could be going through his mind? I admire him a lot for a variety of reasons, and I'd like to be able to find a way to talk to him without feeling strained. I'd appreciate it if you guys could help me gain some insight into what he's thinking. Thanks!
1	Hmmm. There's not so much information here. Is the ESTP still very busy? Was that a good reason before and now the chemistry isn't kicking up the way you'd like?\n\nWhen you said reconnected does that mean just talking? Try being very straightforward! Perhaps tease the guy - we like to chase things if we think we can't have them.\n\nSry that the advice is vague.
1	If an ESTP doesn't like you, he won't talk to you or interact with you. \nIf he likes you, he will make it happen. It's an ESTP after all, we're all about action.  
7	A Little Bit of Personality: Type Heroes: ESTP - The Spartan	
4	Interested in an ESTP, advice needed!	Hey guys! I'm currently interested in a guy at work who I'm fairly (but not completely) sure is ESTP, so I figured I'd come to you all for some advice. I'm having trouble determining whether he's interested in me or not - normally I'd go the direct route and ask him out or something, but this is at work so I'm a bit more hesitant and want to gauge where I stand before trying anything.\n\nWe only see each other at work, used to chat a bit online (he would always initiate, a lot of the time it seemed like he'd try keep the conversation going, but I'm not sure if it's just you ESTPs and talking a lot! haha) but that was more than a month ago and now we only talk when we see each other at work.\n\nHe used to jokingly flirt, make jokes about me missing him or would call me bae etc, but I think he does that with everyone. He hasn't done it the last few times I've seen him, but I'm not sure if that's enough to say that he's stopped completely.\n\nSometimes I feel like he treats me differently from the rest of the crew (he's really helpful in general, but seems to keep more of an eye out for me?), but I'm not sure if that part is my mind playing tricks on me.\n\nSometimes I just feel like I'm just another friend though. The other day he was scrolling through Facebook and just casually pointed out some girl he had hooked up with in the past. Would you guys take that as a big flag that he isn't interested?\n\nAnyways, don't want to ramble on so feel free to ask for more detail/clarification. Thanks guys!
3	> The other day he was scrolling through Facebook and just casually pointed out some girl he had hooked up with in the past. Would you guys take that as a big flag that he isn't interested?\n\nPointing out a girl that he hooked up with? No, this means nothing at all other than it happened to be on the screen. ESTP blunt and honest. It shows that he respects you enough to tell you right away and may actually have been trying to show off that good looking people want to do him!\n\n> sometimes I get the impression he is trying to impress me, like the other day at work he called me over to where he was just to show me a smart thing he'd done haha.\n\nYeah okay he's likes your attention. So it's like this; he probably feels the same thing you do. It's work, right? He doesn't want to make a mess. But he's definately thought about it by now!\n\nI agree with Flux\n\n> If he likes you it'll be obvious. Wanting to do stuff with you, caring about your thoughts on things. Teasing too. That's a BIG turn on\n\n> What you should do is make sure he knows you're interested.\n\nSo it might put him on the spot and feel awkward if you just asked him out. I'd avoid that unless you're in a social environment and, like... you want that sexy time *tonight*, lol. If you want to ramp up the flirting then wait until he's hit on you and give him a sexy wink - it'll probably blow his mind :)\n\nAnd it's mysterious. Or mischievous! I dunno maybe it's just me but if you're both holding eye contact a wink is a good way to send a message because it's kinda discreet. You can probably think of a better alternative way to show him because you know this person. I'm just rambling.
1	Personally, if you're mildly attractive you're almost there. I like being teased a lot as well. Other than that I just want someone to stare into the blackness and loneliness of my heart and still care.\n\nThat might just be me though. \n\nBased on the ESTP type it's very likely that he'll like the chase. Sure, someone that feeds are ego is nice, but I don't know if that lasts.\n\nBe nice but not too nice.\n\nIf he likes you it'll be obvious. Wanting to do stuff with you, caring about your thoughts on things. Teasing too. That's a BIG turn on for me. If he's showing an interest, you should try and show interest but don't scare him away. Although I like straightforwardness it DEFINITELY gives over power. Be intriguing.. \n\nIf you think he likes you, he does.\n\nAs for the comment, he probably didn't mean it that way. I've been told I'm insensitive. And it's a common thing for ESTPs to be unaware. I've made it a rule to stop talking about other girls around anyone that I might be interested in in the future.
1	As an ESTP, I struggle with settling for monogamy. \n\nI suspect this guy, if he is one, is in the same boat. \n\nFew things to know about us/me:\n1)Highly flirtatious\n\n2)Struggle with vulnerability to the point that we need to be told that we aren't opening up\n\n3)Highly sensitive to someone if they are paying us extra attention (we know as soon as someone likes us) and probably try to impress them to keep the attention\n\n4)Our actions reflect our thought process (if we like/want someone we will go for it. If we don't, we won't go for it but we might still flirt)\n \n\nI recommend you take every bit of my advice with a grain of salt because ESTP's especially are very different. Some are cognizant of their Te functionality, some aren't and, some repress their Fe functionality while some are fully aware of it.\n\nSo, this ESTP could be charming but an awful boyfriend. Or extremely self aware - and he would likely go for you if that were the case.\n\nSpeaking as an ESTP, I know I have this deep feeling that I don't belong in a relationship until I figure out myself because I acknowledge my weaknesses(Fe specifically). So, be wary of us - we're a charming bunch
1	My husband's an ESTP and I still haven't gotten him to understand that I don't like it when he talks about girls he used to sleep with.  I met him at work, coincidentally. \n\nI don't know if all ESTPs are like this, but he tends not to have a filter when he's in more relaxed situations.  He also doesn't pick up on hints very well, so you might have to be obvious about your interest.  
7	What makes you tick?	Hello intj here simply wandering around the different subreddits learning about people and types. How do you guys process information? How do you make decisions? How do you deal with people? What makes you you? Anything really that provides insight into what it is like to be in your head is what I am looking for. If I need clarification I will ask and anything helps. 
16	Obviously I can really only speak for myself, but any ESTP who replies should have similar answers.\n\nI process information logically, in a sequential order, and will be mostly fixated on that information until I have processed it sufficiently enough to either come to a conclusion about something or some other reason that is useful to me in some way.  An example would be a rumbling I heard in my car once.  I knew it wasn't supposed to be rumbling, so until the problem was solved, if I wasn't busy with anything, I was thinking about the rumbling.  If I was busy, it was still in the back of my mind.  Always.  My thought process was: "Ok, I know this isn't supposed to happen.  Where is it coming from? Sounds like underneath the car, so probably not an engine issue.  When does it happen?  When I'm accelerating in 2nd gear usually, and then it stops.  Hmm, maybe something with the 2nd gear? It sounds further back than that though.  Maybe something broke and it resonates when the car is going specifically that speed?"  Sure enough, part of the exhaust system had rusted through and was rumbling from the vibrations when I was going that particular speed.  I didn't have the ability to fix it myself, though, so off to the shop!\n\nHow do I make decisions? It depends on what the end goal is really.  If it's work, then my decision is based on the easiest and fastest way to get the job done.  If it's just a personal decision, it's usually based on what will be the most fun.  I think in general ESTP's are geared towards fun.  Like in the work example, I think I want to get the work done easily and quickly because the sooner it's done, the sooner I'm finished doing work and can get back to having fun.  It's like persistently the end goal to anything I do.  Not to say work itself isn't fun, as long as it's stimulating, I usually enjoy it.  That's another thing about ESTP's.  We need a lot of external stimulation.  I get bored very easily and when I have an idea or want to do something I want to do it, right now, in it's entirety, and if I can't I'll probably get pissed off, or at least a little frustrated because some external force, outside of my control is preventing me from experiencing what I want to experience right now.  This can lead to destruction in some way a lot of times because the motive is generally to do or experience or create something, and when restricted, that sensation still longs to be filled, so anything that will provide that stimulation will have to suffice.  That's video games are awesome! It stimulates the mind without really being too destructive (as long as you can control how long you play).  That was a lot on our sensing aspect, not a whole lot on decision making, but I think I gave you a good idea of out decision making motives haha\n\nHow do I deal with people?  Pretty easily.  I don't have much problem conversing with people or working with people.  It bothers me when people can't carry on a conversation.  I asked someone the other day what kind of music he liked, and he gave me a smart alec response, and it was funny, but he didn't expand at all afterwards, so the conversation was over, and we just sat in silence the rest of the time.  I just give up when people do things like that.  It isn't worth my time to try and continuing to talk.  I love social settings where people are having fun and there's a lot going on.  That actually reminds me of settings like concerts or parties.  That somewhat chaotic loudness helps me think more clearly I think.  Again the sensing aspect at play.  In those situations, I am almost more aware of what is going on around me than usual because I have the external sounds and experience stimulating my senses, so my brain doesn't have to be as busy constantly thinking about things to preoccupy me so I'm not bored, and this leaves my brain more free to actively think about my surroundings.  Meetings? Super boring.  Fire drills? Emergencies? Any event that requires immediate action? Bring 'em on.  That's what we're made for.  While other people are running around freaking out, we had analyzed our surrounds thoroughly already, and are jumping to action to save the day or ensure whatever the objective may be is completed fast.  That's a segue to another aspect of ESTP's (sorry for going off topic, but I think I'm giving you what you want here).  While always focused on the objective, it's also very very easy for us to shift mindsets almost instantaneously.  Not interested in doing this anymore? No problem, move onto something else.  I was making something in the garage, but I think I want to go play guitar now.  I can just get back to what I was making later.  Guitar would stimulate me more than this, so obviously I'm going to go play guitar!  Even in sports, I loved playing, but I ever really cared if I won or lost.  It was the playing itself that I liked.  I like *playing* basketball, *playing* golf, *playing* lacrosse, but winning any of them doesn't really matter much to me because I had fun in the playing of the sport.  Once it's over, the winner can brag all he or she wants, I have to go do something else because  being the winner or loser doesn't interest me at all; it's a waste of my time.  Time that could be spent doing something else that's fun!\n\nDoing things is what makes me tick!  I've gotten envious of coworkers who were asked to do certain things because what they were asked to do sounded fun, and I was left to sit in my seat writing up some report or something.  When it comes to something needing fixing I will always try to fix it myself because "it's fun, it's doing something, it stimulates my brain, and I guess it solves the problem, but that isn't as important as the experience of fixing whatever it is"\n\nI hope this was some good insight! I could probably go on with other questions, but I think I answered yours sufficiently!
1	I know it's been awhile since you've posted this but I get really mad at myself when I can't explain my thoughts/feelings. I also have a very hard time committing. I'll start a project -work really hard all day on it- then the next day I'm bored of the project. I've started so many projects that end in failure. 
1	PEOPLE WHO CAN'T DO THEIR FREAKING JOBS.
4	ESTP redheads?	4 redheads that I know are ESTPs, and I was wondering if this is a common trend.  Maybe the genetic trait for red hair is linked somehow?
3	I'm not a red head, but I wouldn't know if it's common among ESTPs since I haven't met others.
3	i dont hvae redhair but i love redheads. 
2	ISTP redhead, if that counts.
2	what that's so weird, I'm an ESTP and a redhead too. lol maybe you're on to something
1	Blond myself, and coincidentally most ESTPs I met were blond too. Maybe there's a connection..?

1	I have this theory that MBTI types can be traced geographically. Seeing as certain types match well with other types. \n\nObviously I can't prove this.\n\nBut, I've met a lot of Irish ESTP's- just go to Boston sometime. It could be a thing\n\n
1	I know a red haired estp male
1	Totally a redhead!\n
1	I'm kind of a red head. 
0	You're a dumbass.
5	What kind of movies and tv do you like?	Comedies, fantasy, action, romance, SVU/Law and Order, sci fi, game shows, trivia shows, what is it? I'm trying to type a crazy ESTP I met. 
3	I like sci-fi\n\nRick & Morty, Star Gate Unverse (fuck the others ones), i don't like to admit it but i have watched star trek!\n\nAlso enjoy QI - which is a general interest quiz show presented by comedians\n\nIn terms of tv stuff i've recently enjoyed Mr.Robot, i've watched all of house, scrubs, suits, breaking bad, and i like the first season of walking dead (but fuck the other seasons).
2	I'm a sucker for shows like house of cards and the walking dead. I'd say my favorite movie is The wolf of Wall Street 
0	What's your sign?	I know there are 16 personality types and only 12 horoscope signs but I'm still curious what your sign is. I'm a Taurus :)\n\nDo you think they relate? 
4	Well considering a 'real' MBTI assessment is based on the participant's responses to hundreds of detailed questions asked by a psychologist, I don't think they compare in the slightest.\n\nHoroscopes are blatantly useless as they have nothing practical to use as a means of assessing a person's personality.\n\nAlso MBTI types are a spectrum; we can barely even say that we are a single "type" like a horoscope.\n\nFinally, if you just think about it, why would you ever expect hundreds of millions of people who share a birthday range to exhibit such similar traits? And I'm really surprised to hear this belief/notion/thought experiment from somebody who identifies as ESTP, because typically we are said to feel unique and self-superior which directly contradicts the entire concept of horoscopes.\n\nMBTI is already bullshitty/wishy-washy and I think it only serves to discredit the system when people compare it other things which do not form conclusions based on real observations.
1	Extremely active by nature, you like to get around, meet people and do different things. Very restless, you just can't seem to stay put. You need to be involved in several projects at once in order to keep your mind stimulated. You like to read books and to write letters and to talk -- constantly. Seemingly ageless, you will always appear to be much younger than you really are. Very adaptable and inquisitive, you are always open to new ideas and experiences. A "jack-of-all-trades", you are lively and versatile. Because of the high nervous tension that you always seem to have, athletic activity would be a good way for you to burn off energy. But be careful of a tendency to experience things only superficially -- try to dig in and absorb things at a deeper level. \n\n\nExtremely sensitive and emotional, you absorb the emotions of others (whether positive or negative) like a sponge. You are at your best when you can structure your environment in such a way that you are surrounded by positive, upbeat people. You are very helpful and understanding of the needs of others. Indeed, at times this can be a disadvantage, because you can be a sucker for anyone who needs help. Shy, dreamy, romantic in nature, you delight in retreating into your private fantasy world. Just be careful that you do not get lost in it! Trust your intuitions -- you may be quite psychic. \n\n\nYour feelings are very intense, never superficial. You tend to be either very angry or very sad or completely and totally happy. Your moods are deep, extreme and not always completely understood by yourself or by those with whom you have to deal. Emotionally, you tend to prefer to live at the cutting edge of life, pushing your reactions to the ultimate extremes, even if the results are dangerous or upsetting. You are easily jealous and very suspicious -- you require a great deal of emotional reassurance. A good detective, you are very curious about deep and mysterious things, especially human nature and motivations. Be careful not to be ruthless, tactless or too overly frank or you will meet with much resistance from others. \n\nThis could literally be about 50% of the people in this sub. I just entered in some random birthday. Astrology is a bunch of shit.

10	Functions	**Dominant Se (ESXP)**: Experiences are the stuff of life. I want to go snowboarding! Skydiving! Drive a racecar! Give me an adrenaline rush, and I’m fabulous. Okay, what’s up? I saw your eye twitch. That means you’re upset, but about what? Oh, I can leap in there and do this, no problem! See? It’s easy! You need a part time lion tamer? I’m sure I can learn it in no time. Okay, so here are the sixteen awesome things we can do in this theme park. Which one first? Look, you do that, I can hold this, and keep track of the kids, and check my Blackberry, and call Gary back all at the same time. You know, someone could make a lot of money if they—oh, what the heck, I’ll just do it. While you were standing there gaping, I saved the kid from the bus. I want to try that out; I think my body can take it, and it’ll be fun to find out. I’m going to say this, and see what people do…\n\n**Auxiliary Ti (EXTP)**: Hmm, give me a second… okay, I know what to do. I know how this works and how to fix it. I just analyzed it from six different angles in my head and feel comfortable with diving right in. I can take this situation or problem apart and reassemble it. That sounds illogical, so I’m going to ignore it. If I have time, I’ll argue with it. Look, cut the crap and get to the point. THIS is the problem and THIS is how we fix it. Did you enjoy my three word answer? It really annoys me when people take too long to explain something, because it’s easy for me to sum it up in a few words. No, I understand the system, I have it, let’s start in on it and get things done! Hop to it! Chop chop!\n\n**Tertiary Fe (EXTP)**: I find it easy to connect to people and make friends. I’m good at smoothing things over between people, so we can accomplish things together. You’re really doing a good job with that; you’re a natural at this, you know! I’m glad you feel comfortable with me. I like you too. I know how you feel, and I’m sorry this is happening to you. Tell me how I can help, so I’m not just sad on your behalf. I feel like I need to take care of you, and be responsible for you. If you mess with someone I love, I will kick your butt; do you hear me? Hey, do you want to talk about how you feel? I can share some stuff about myself, too, if it makes you feel better. People find me friendly and enthusiastic.\n\n**Inferior Ni (ESXP)**: Though I care more about what’s happening in my life right now, I want to have a good future. I haven’t forgotten my dreams, and I’ll figure out how to make them a reality one of these days. I like thinking about my future life and, although it’s hard, I can learn to put aside immediate experiences if I know the long-term goal is worth the wait! I feel optimistic about the future, and sometimes out of the blue, know how to do something that I have never tried doing before. I’m not sure how, but I knew that person would do that.\n\nSource: http://funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/cognitivefunctions
3	Dude, thank you for posting this! It's like "hey that's me!" and every other ESTP is saying the same thing.  
3	I love this so much! And, as the bff of an amazing ESTP, I can say without hesitation, the Fe of an ESTP is a beautiful thing, and to be on the receiving end is something very special. She has said many of those *exact* things to me, lol. Yall are pretty damn awesome!!!
1	Spot on\n
3	Help an INTP tutoring an ESTP	Hi r/ESTP, I'm in my early twenties and have recently begun to tutor a middle-school-aged ESTP girl, in English reading and writing, and Math (she's told me she performs much better with Math than English reading and writing). She's very intelligent, sharp, patient, empathic, has an understated curiosity, and also deals with ADD - I do as well, but we experience it with very notable Ne-Si vs. Se-Ni differences: my inattentiveness is often around different streams of ideas or thoughts racing through my mind and competing with one another, which displays itself as sometimes jumping from topic to topic, switching between metaphors, and pausing between words or sentences to refocus my mind on whatever thought I had begun. Her form of ADD (some of you may not need me to elaborate here) centers around her dominant Se - easily distracted by what is physically around her (specifically sounds and movements), can forget what she hears moments after hearing it, finds reading challenging because her mind doesn't like processing minute details (E.g., was shy about reading, and reading aloud, as she had to go slowly and would skip words or misinterpret them, and found words with many consonants and foreign roots/origins, like 'ballet' troublesome to read and spell). She is also very self conscious of this, especially since today was our first session, and is sensitive to correction, which has made me avoid it on occasion because I was afraid of hurting her feelings and she often can find her mistakes on her own if she double checks her work (though she seems to not either like doing it or forgets, or some combination of the two). I'm also relatively new to tutoring, or at least am highly out of practise - the last time I found myself frequently giving help to students in middle school or high school was when I was attending them both, as a student. I feel very nervous working with her as I can easily slip into giving as much an encyclopedic background as I possess (which I quickly became mindful of with her), when explaining concepts, like a particular rule of grammar, which I'm afraid possibly tests her patience. I can't read her expressions or body consistently (never sure if I am right or wrong), and she isn't very vocal since she's shy. On top of this, Ni isn't the kind of function that is willing to explain itself at length or in depth, so it's hard for me to gauge her thinking process to help her where needed. \n\nIn terms of strengths, she thinks very clearly and quickly, and has that great hyper focus ability, so when she engages, she does so fully. She has also had tutoring for several years (though she may not have had an INTP), and so far seems relatively temperate and eagerly takes instruction. Again referencing hyper focus, her memory and ability to absorb material is also very strong, so long as her attention is engaged - for example, even though she struggles with reading and pronunciation, she retains the ideas presented in the material and can easily answer questions on what was mentioned in the passages (I am a bit of the opposite). \n\nAny advice? Individual differences despite personality 'type' aside, what are some teaching and/or occasional correction approaches that you have responded well to and/or prefer? Assuming I'm a more or less a blank slate, what are some important things I should know or consider about building trust with and taking on a teaching role with a(n) (young) ESTP, or simply interacting with one, in general? How should I go about handling detail as someone who can frequently and unknowingly get borderline pedantic with details, and how could I use that to somehow benefit this student and help her grow intellectually and academically (from your opinion/experience)? Are there methods and strategies I could pass to her, that may help her better manage attention to little things, like spelling and grammar, or in other academic areas? (One thing I tried was asking her to follow lines on the page with her pen, as she read aloud, to help keep her eyes from jumping sentences, which seemed to help a little bit, until she forgot to do so, as she got caught up in the actual reading process.) How could I establish better trust and/or make her feel safe enough to make mistakes without 'feeling dumb' or 'incompetent', in order to focus on growing past them? Any input at all would be greatly welcomed and appreciated; and thanks in advance. (Also, if anything I mentioned needs further clarification, please let me know.)\n\nAlso - sorry about the length. 
4	You should hold off on the typing. She's just a kid who gets distracted easily. It doesn't mean she's ESTP also you should focus more on trying to help her.\n\nWhere do you tutor her? Make sure there isn't a lot of distractions around you. Try a library or reserve a study room. When correcting her try not to point it out but stop the lesson and ask if there were any mistakes just now. Do it frequently so she can get the hang of going back and correcting herself. This also makes it seem like you're not stopping her at every mistake, you should also stop her when she's correct. When it comes to being self conscious when reading, try reading out loud with her. Go at her pace or if you want take turns reading to each other so she isn't so uncomfortable. Let her know that it's okay to make mistakes. Try to make the lesson more interesting or take frequent 5 minute breaks or less. Add games to the lesson and make sure to interact throughout the lesson so she isn't distracted or gets bored.\n\nThese are all basic tips from when I used to be an English tutor. Hope it helps.
2	Haha! Wonderful post, well written and organized. It shows the INTP in you.\n\nAs advice, if you can find a way to make her curious or interested in the subject it would be the best, but otherwise praise her when she does well and to challenge her to stimulate her competitive instincts.
1	To help her focus. Let her move and hyper focus on things. So if she is reading out loud, let her pace or walk as she reads. Play some music in the background that has no words, just a sick beat. Toss a ball back and forth while talking about the subject at hand. \n\nWalking about, tossing a ball.. all things that engage the distracted parts of her brain, the part that instinctively needs action. While letting the part of her brain that is involved with higher more critical thinking, do other things.
1	If she's ESTP the number one rule is: don't bore her. Luckily my favorite teacher ever was an INTP so you've got the one thing we're looking for in a teacher which is COOL views. Show them to her.
2	So what do you guys do for work?	Hi, I am an estp with an enormous penis, I was just wondering what type of jobs you guys have that you enjoy and feel like you can be yourself at? More looking for suggestions for things I would enjoy being an estp than really wanting to know about your jobs.
7	>enormous penis\n\nPics or it didn't happen.
2	I am currently procrastinating myself through a masters program at my university. I manage a local laundromat (I love this). I also pet/house sit very frequently. I have 5 steady clients at this time. I kinda sorta work/have been "adopted" by this couple. They are more like my true parents than those who raised me. We just match. I wrk with them a lot. Running errands, etc. so kinda a personal assistant. \n\nAlso, my threshold of boredom for a job is about 2 years and I'm ready to move on. 
1	In answer to your question:\n\nMy job itself is boring. My place of employment isn't. The culture, the people, all make the boring part worth it. \n\nPlus, I'm loved for my personality type and what I can offer. Part of that is being an ESTP. 
1	I'm currently a student with a bartending job for weekends.
1	how many sandwhiches can you guys eat?
3	[Master Personality Typology Survey] I'm conducting a survey to analyze correlations between popular personality typologies, and I need a lot more ESTPs in it!	
1	I already knew the first two. Did number 3 and got bored. Opened 4 and balked. \n\nI see what you're doing, but daaaaaaaaaaaaaang. 
7	Se Ti Fe Ni	Selenium Titanium Iron Nickel
5	Oh.
3	Yeah, as I'm getting older my poop has higher and higher concentration of nickel
4	Is this ESTP into me?	So this is an update to this post https://www.reddit.com/r/estp/comments/3zzko3/the_best_way_to_say_to_estp_you_like_them/ \n\nI actually had the guts to ask this ESTP guy out and it was really nice. He replied "with pleasure", picked me up at my place. We drove around the city, drank wine and ate chocolate. He really opened up. Told me eveything about his life, including some tragic stories. I also all of a sudden opened up about inner stuff, people don't normally talk about on dates. \n\nWe didn't kiss though, which I found strange, because there were several moments where I thought it would be appropriate. He didn't go for it, I didn't want to initiate. \n\nAnyway, it's been  5 days since then, but he didn't text me about the second date. I mean we comment and like each other on Facebook as usual, but I really hoped he would initiate this time, because I initiated the first one.   \n\nI am not sure what to think. ESTPs can you help me decipher this? Is he into me or not?
4	Not everyone is the same, and ESTP is a lot of people. Beeing forward burned me bad with a good friend of mine, kinda ruined it for more people then she and I. So I stopped beliving girls wanted to be more than friends. \n\nAlso I did not care much either way, as long as I had friends around me and shit to do I did not care. If I liked someone I did not bother with the hassel of feelings.\n\nLater I had a girl push a bit and it almost worked out, but I needed that push to actually see that she was intrested. If he is like me, ask for one more date, he will propably say yes or inform you that he is not interested. If you still get no info, ask him, and he will answer strait. If you push for physical comfirmation he might just roll with it. \n\nI know as I get older I like to just say things as it is, and have it in the open. With people I like more so, because I know that I just push shit down, happy or sad. Makes me look like I dont give two fucks, and it works for me most of the time.\n\nTL;DR: Dont be afraid to take the lead. ESTP (or at least me) might push down everything and be happy with friends.
1	Company assigning employees to teams based on their personality?	Back when i was in college and as part of their recruitment process, I took a personality test before getting an offer letter from a company. There was no result or description of my personality after the test completed - the results were just sent to the company \n\nAnyhow, now I have reasons to believe that the company divides it's employees into teams based on the test results. \n\n(i)There were two sides to the office - one was a lot smaller than the other, I was in the smaller side. \n\n(ii)Now that I look back, 100% of the interns on the smaller side were introverts - that number is about 70-80% for other employees. \n\n(iii) R&D department was on the smaller side along with two other teams and Susan Cain has mentioned t in her book hat companies fill their R&D departments with introverts. \n\n(iv) All the events (eg. Fun Friday) were organized on the bigger side - it was optional for everyone - but since we were in the other side, it was easier for us to concentrate on our work.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?
3	I think it would be cool for company's to do that so that they could hire based on their needs or by helping people by putting them with others that are similar so they could work more efficiently. But I do think it only benefits some types, in ESTPs I think this would benefit us but I'm not sure it would work for others.
2	I think that I experienced something very similar. I underwent a MBTI styled test for my first job, and like you, did not receive my results. In retrospect this could have affected my position, I was never considered for promotion. This was when I was very young, so my result was probably not 'ESTP' it was probably 'INFP' or something. \n\nAs I became more confident in my abilities and as a person I probably developed into an ESTP. I took another job in the same field and was immediately offered a management position.\n\nI'm not sure how relevant my comment is, but looking back, I do think that them typing me could have influenced (more like stunted) my progress in that industry. \n\nHmm! Interesting question :) 
1	I need some advice on screening questions	Hi guys, INTJ here. I'd like some advice. I was reading this book about hiring others. The practice task it set out was that I should (a) list out the desirable qualities in a co-worker, and (b) write out questions that could help identify those traits easily.\n\nSo I've come up with a list of trait and I wanted to pick your brain to see if you could think up any good screening questions.\n\n1. Sincerity/Honesty\n\n2. Communicative or open to communication\n\n3. Reasonable and willing to look at things in a new way\n\n4. Supportive/Empathetic\n\n5. Stable, not likely to quit a job at the drop of a hat\n\nThank you!
1	Thought of a couple questions that may help:\nHow have you handled disputes between other coworkers and yourself?\nDescribe a time where you have had to compromise with other coworkers.\nHow would you interact with a coworker who recently lost a close family member?\nJust some of the first things that came to mind
2	The best way to say to ESTP you like them	Hey, guys! \nWhat's the best way to show ESTP you like them? \nI like this ESTP guy (I am INFJ by the way), and I am sensing that he likes me back. We usually comment each other on facebook, and when we meet in a group of people I feel like he pays special attention to talking and interacting with me.  \nI can proceed to subtly flirt with him, but I can also straightforwardly ask him out. I am quite confident in that way and am not afraid of rejection, at least I'll move on.\n \nWhat would you recommend? Do you like straightforward people or is it a turn off? 
13	Get close to him, stare deeply into his eyes, one arm around his neck, lean in and whisper, "the Lannisters send their regards," and stab him in the gut with your hidden blade. You'll drive him crazy.
10	Say something suggestive that will leave him speechless. Then smile and own it like saying "yeah I went there. I'm hot, I want you, what ya gonna do about it?"
3	Go ahead and tell him you like him.\nSure, flirting is fun, but no need to 'beat around the bush' with ESTPs. Being straight-to-the-point isn't a turn-off, atleast to me, but shows confidence and is a more effective way to communicate. Good luck!
3	Flirt and please be straight forward. Ask questions about him to show that you're interested in who he is and joke a bit with him too (maybe even a little suggestively). ESTP's love talking and if you can make them laugh, I think it'll go well :)
1	I like you?  :)\n\n^(INTP btw)
1	There's no need to beat around the bush. However, I've slowly come to realize that the chase is a good chunk of the attraction. \n\nAll I'm saying is don't make it too easy for him. 
1	JUST\nDO \nIT.\n\nWe need to be told. We are terrible at reading people. Be straightforward or ~~I~~ we will scream.
1	Ok so people here have been saying to be straight forward with ESTPs.\nI have been pretty much doing all of what has been suggested here (being extremely straight forward and suggestive) and he's been very responsive at times. But then he is really avoidant when it comes to setting up a date to actually meet, eventhough he says he wants to. Then there's times when he doesn't respond to any messages in weeks just to continue sending me hot suggestive messages for several days. I don't want to be the one always calling because when I suggest a concrete time to meet via text it is left unanswered, but maybe that's what it takes?
1	You have to be straight to the point
3	Hey guys what does your handwriting look like?	"Wait a minute, this doesn't belong here!"\nOn the contrary, yes it does! I'm conducting an experiment to see if there is any correlation between the types and their handwritings. They say that handwriting is one of the keys to your personality since your brain controls your hand right?\nAnyways, I would really appreciate some samples! Thanks! Don't forget to mention your type (if you are a person lurking on another type's sub of course!)
4	I have absolutely terrible handwriting 
3	Mine looks like an epileptic third grader's, but part of that is a fine motor control disability. 
4	Mine literally changes as I write. I go from neat to messy in a single sentence and have a nasty habit of writing in this bastardized version of both cursive and printing.
3	Here's mine:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/DON83Q0.jpg?1
2	I absolutely cannot write in large letters. I just can't. The largest I can write usually take up 3/4 of the college-ruled space. Weird mixture of cursive and print, as I just each letter as however I feel like.\n\nResult: tiny, messy letters.
1	I have almost the exact same handwriting as my mom, very neat with letters tending to come out the same every time. As for fancier writing (such as a signature) it always looks messy and it tends to change quite a bit.
1	Small handwriting and like a typewriter, I guess. I've always been told that I have great penmanship. I also always have to correct people when they think I haven't signed or filled in a form until I point out my handwriting.
1	My handwriting is pretty neat. It's linked, medium sized and on a right slant. 
1	So bad. Seeing it, you'd probably think I was a drunk, ham fisted toddler. I saw a note I wrote my mom 22 years ago...it looks exactly the same today. I'm 35. 
7	I can't believe I just read all the posts on this subreddit in half an hour...	Can't say that I have read any of the post thoroughly or that I actually read every post on here, but man, reading up on 3 years worth of texts in under an hour is quite an experience. This subreddit really is dead, isn't it haha. (I get it, we all got better things to do, it's just that I was super tired today and had nothing to do.. It sucks that my school ended literally when all my friends are going back :/)\n\nAnyway, to celebrate the occasion (completing a subreddit is quite an achievement imo), I got a question for you all busy people: do any of you enjoy being the "clown" in a group? I know that I for one like to play "dumb" and just come off as really nonchalant and innocent, sometimes ignorant, but nonetheless funny; but in reality I'm actually aware of everything that's happening, very observant and am noticing every detail of my friends' body language and such. I was just wondering if I'm the only one here who likes being seen as easy-going and nonthreatening ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
2	As someone who leans towards ENTP sometimes, I tend to dominate most conversations. \n\nI still keep track of body language and be the clown, but I'm usually driving the conversation where I (or if someone seems uncomfortable, they) feel it should go. 
2	I'm not sure about being a clown, but I'm known as funny. I like making people laugh but I never dumb myself down. I also don't go out of the way to correct people's assumptions but I also don't hide how observant I am.
1	I actually feel everything u say lol, that's how I act with all the friends that I have
3	Mh ESTP friend is suffering from anxiety, and tries to control it by using drugs and particilating in hedonistic behavior. Any ESTP has advice I could give to him?	I'm ENTP. I don't really understand Se
9	I'm an ENTP also but I'm married to an ESTP so I'll give this a shot.  I recommend physical activity like working out. My ESTP seems to get anxious when he's not confident or sure of himself... Martial arts, working out, and playing sports all seem to help him with those things. 
6	I am estp with a fair amount of social anxiety. I always tried to mask the anxiety with alcohol which lead to embarassing drunk person behavior which lead to MORE anxiety at the next event.  I recently came to the realization that I don't have to be the center of attention and I have fewer social regrets when I stay sober (or near sober).\n\nI can relate to what fuzzylettuce said too. I tend to feel like my flaws are amplified so working out and taking care of my appearance has helped as well.\n
3	Anything that will improve confidence - so it depends why he is anxious. That anxiety is the energy to solve the problem that disturbs your friend and he need only find a way to apply it.
3	I think another factor is having no control over the situations presented with. its what i have troubles with.
3	this person probably lacks physical exercise. Se is all about the (ACTUALL PRESENT). ESTPs need to go out and experience things else they will by a big, chance get depressed or anxious.
2	I've never been there so I wouldn't know but I think letting him build confidence for himself is good. A way to achieve that would probably be to give him something to succeed at. Whether it be sports, music, etc. as long as he gets good enough at it to gain self-confidence.. His situation should improve imo
2	I think tell him just that. He'll probably be upset and challenge you. But, you'll probably change his life for the better.
0	Pen pals with ENFP Girl?	hum my tumblr is enfpiss
4	What do you guys think of INTPs?	I'm an INTP and I'm really starting to believe this guy I've been having a crush on is an ESTP. He has tested as an ENTJ and ISTP before but looking at his personality with my mbti knowledge I've come to the conclusion that he's either ESTP or ESFP. Most likely ESTP because of this massive Se-Fe loop he had last summer when he was depressed and alcoholic.\n\nEither way, I'm curious to hear what you think about us INTPs and if we're a good match at all in your opinion!
1	I actually love intps when I can hold their interest.  imo they lose interest in people very quickly, but they can also have really awesome discussions about practically anything. 
1	I think I'm ESTP (strong Se but tests keep on telling me that I'm ENTP which I don't think is all that wrong either.. Really unsure whether I have stronger Se or Ne, although I'm leaning heavily towards stronger Se the more I think about this MBTI stuff) and my best friend's an INTP.. I like the fact that he doesn't require constant attention from me, which means I get to forget about him without feeling guilty or anything. He's like a low maintenance friend who can actually entertain me with intellectual (and actually logical) statements and somehow understand the rules of my own world and where I'm coming from.
1	My on-off boyfriend is an INTP. He's the only man who has kept my interest. He's clever, witty, intelligent and single-mindedly passionate about his hobbies. He's very insular, and we fight a lot, but he's better than anyone I've ever met.\nINTP's are allgood in my book! 
1	[deleted]
5	Hello, dead subreddit, you may or may not have a potential new member	Alright so, I got into MBTI stuff recently and been spending ours studying what the hell this is about and trying to figure out more about it until I understand how this shit works.. All the tests confirm me as an ENTP and I really do agree with the descriptions in general (I also feel connected to the people on r/entp as well) but when I started learning about cognitive functions, I thought I was more of an Se than a Te. Then I thought: what if I'm an ESTP?! And so I read on as many articles as I could about this type, and figured I really am an ESTP. Very objective about everything, apathetic about life, super outgoing yet insensitive and often blunt. My best friends back in high school did call me an asshole because I kept on insulting them apparently (I just wanted to comment on how horrible their hair looked). Also getting bored easily and what not, the typical ESTP stuff.\n\nSo here I am, seriously thinking that I might have been mistyped as ENTP. But one thing bothers me; I'm not an athlete nor do I work out regularly. Although I do love going to the gym and feel very refreshed after working out, I just lack the consistency just like with anything. The only thing that I'm obsessed about and use to kill my boredom is Starcraft - it's such a dynamic game that it keeps me stimulated, albeit mentally, and the fact that it's physically demanding as well (that 300 APM!) although I'm only using my hands seem to keep me going. So I was just wondering if you guys think my obsession of a video game is actually huge factor that may as well be a proof of my NOT being an ESTP. (Wow that was such a poorly phrased sentence).\n\nThanks all in advance &lt;3\n\nEdit: about traveling. As much as I love going to new places, I never actively plan a trip for myself because 1) I'm too lazy and 2) going by myself doesn't seem appealing at all. Like, the beauty of nature and what not doesn't interest me because I see no practical value in appreciating the landscape or whatever but if I'm walking around with some good people I'm totally down to travel. I don't know if that makes sense but yeah, I'm just adding this here because I think that tendency goes against ESTP.
3	> because I see no practical value in appreciating the landscape or whatever\n\nThat tendency does not go against ESTP. Who gives a fuck about landscape?! I can appreciate a great view and there's certainly a natural curiosity to discover stuff... but without other people around it would not be the same experience.\n\n*Edited* because i was on a train earlier but there was more to say!\n\nMaybe [this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/9d/49/39/9d4939ab9401317a2cf0c2554de0f89b.jpg) helps to discern the different between Te and Se.\n\nI find it easy to track what is happening in a video game and position myself or my team in a way to take advantage ... this doesn't require much effort / thinking. It's totally reactive - i'm not even very good at remembering things (in general) but in the moment i'll recall a solution / similar event and act accordingly to prevent losing the game or whatever.\n\nAgain - this doesn't require much effort for the ESTP because it is primary function oriented.\n\n> I'm not an athlete nor do I work out regularly\n\nYeah but you gotta appreciate that a stereotype doesn't control your life. If you smoked cigarettes for the past 10 years you're not going to be an athlete either... The stereotype describes a predisposition and it's not a guarantee that the individual will have engaged in stereotypical activities.\n\nI contacted people who knew me 10 years earlier to ask them about physicality. Apparently i have always done bursts of working out when stressed - but simply didn't acknowledge this behavior.\n\nI've also discovered that it is common for ESTPs who do not frequently engage in team sports to be keen on music (specifically guitar) or extreme sports. I can relate to this because i have picked up guitar, skateboarding and trick bmxing despite not considering myself 'athletic'.\n\nYou may also like to know that i played SC too. Up to high plat before throwing in the towel.\n\nEdit 2; Take a look at [this](http://www.celebritytypes.com/misc_pictures/all_types_cognitive_functions.png) functional diagram. You can see that ESTP and ENTP have similarities but also you can see the best way to try and discern a difference.\n\nPlease note; MBTI is not proven scientifically and therefore many aspects of it should be taken with a pinch of salt (similar to how you might be skeptical of a horoscope).
1	You sound just like me. You might actually be ESTP. (the attitude to gym, the gaming, the socialising, etc.)\n\nThing is. This test isn't very concrete and for a friend of mine the results for F vs T were equal, so we read both profiles and some parts matched and others didn't. This might be the case for you.
1	I've (INFJ) known an ESTP for many years: I met him playing WoW and he is far from an athlete (he hates organized sports, in fact). I think the thing that makes me sure he is an ESTP is that natural pragmatism without any sort of dogma attached. He just purely kinda knows what works, what doesn't, what are the direct steps to take to get to where he wants, and he'll take 'em without waiting around. He doesn't particularly give a shit about landscapes either (that seems more Introverted Sensing to me, honestly). ESTPs just naturally act like "alphas": strong, in control, charming, naturally loathe "authority", and ready to buy everybody a round of drinks. Really great at reading people and understanding just what a person can do at a glance.\n\nThis ESTP is also a programmer. Make of that what you will. ESTPs are the only programmers I've ever seen that can watch a movie, chat with 10 people, and bang out a ton of code all at the same time. 
1	Do you owe your brother money?
3	Bad estp's	My brother is an ESTP. He has borrowed thousands of dollars from family members without ever paying it back. He does drugs and drinks and lies about it. He enjoys violence. I don't talk to him anymore because I got tired of being manipulated into giving him money and doing favors for him. My mother and I are basically raising his children so that he can spend his money on drugs and Gucci clothes. He has weird aggressive conservative views about "people on welfare" and yet he doesn't mind cashing in those disability checks because his enjoyment of heroin makes him "disabled." He  rants about gays and blacks and Muslims at family dinners while drinking double martinis in front of the children. He's the poster child for ESTP douchebaggery and I am ashamed of him.
3	I'm sry.\n\nI'm also an ESTP and I hope I'm none of these things you describe.
2	Sounds like he has a super undeveloped Fe. Sorry you have to deal with that. 
3	(xpost r/mbti) MBTI podcast hosted by ENTP & ESFP ep. 4: What is an Explorer/Artisan/SP?	Whether you've been following us or have no idea who we are, hi! We're two opinionated best friends using personality typing to understand themselves and the world. I'm an ENTP and Meredith's an ESFP. We're learners and hobbyists, not experts.\n\n* [Soundcloud.com/when-myers-met-briggs](https://soundcloud.com/when-myers-met-briggs)\n\n* [Facebook.com/WhenMyersMetBriggs](https://www.facebook.com/WhenMyersMetBriggs)\n\n* [Subscribe on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/when-myers-met-briggs/id1060274982)\n\nIn our fourth episode we discuss the first of the four type families: Those that share SP, also known as Explorers or Artisans. We note themes across all SP types and then dive into ESFP, ESTP, ISTP and ISFP. *Mad shoutouts to ESTPs in there ;)*\n\n**Please let me know what you think, either here or review us on iTunes!**\n

4	Do you like INFJs?	On the INFJ page its mentioned often that INFJs don't really like or get along with ESTPs.  Im curious what your opinion of us is.  \n\nI met a guy who is ESTP and he's quite possibly the most interesting guy I've ever met.  \n\nI've only known a few in the past and I tend to have love/hate relationships with ESTPs.  \n\nPersonally what I love about your type that I see often is you all tend to be quite intimidating and you don't take shit from anyone.  I personally HATE passive aggressiveness and am drawn to straight forward people.  \n\nI know that INFJs are known to hate conflict and are passive aggressive, but I grew up in a very verbal outspoken home and I would rather you call me out and solve the issue right away.  If I have to dwell it eats me alive.  \n\nI guess I really hope the relationship develops but when I read these subs I get nervous from all the people who say they don't get along with your type.

5	I'm not an ESTP but am an INFJ and I've been married to an ESTP for 28 yrs. Definitely challenging at times but we make it work. Sometimes we have a love/hate relationship but always work thru it by good communication.  It's definitely not boring and we seem to balance each other out.
3	It's funny because I came to this thread to ask exactly the same question. I am an INFJ and I recently met ESTP who I developped a crush on. \n\nActually, it's quite understandable in socionics terms - because INFJs and ESTPs are duals - they are believed to balance eath other's functions. Because one's Inferior is the other one's Dominant. \n\nI've had very different experiences with ESTPs. One was professor at Uni, who's lectures I used to enjoy a great deal, and had a great friendship with him. The other one was the guy I used to briefly date, and it was frankly awful. We had very different political views and passively hated each other for them. \nI have high hopes for this new ESTP I've met. INFJ and ESTP is a challenging but exciting mix in my opinion. And nor we nor ESTPs like boredom, so.. :)
3	I am an ESTP (male) and my mom is an INFJ. I thoroughly enjoy hanging out with my mom; we get along extremely well. I am the youngest of four children, all of which are different types (ENTJ, ENFJ, and ESFJ, respectively). I can confidently say that I get along with my mom the best. INFJs are really good at playing the extrovert, and ESTPs are really good at playing an introvert at times. We have very similar interests and even read the same kinds of books. We definitely see/perceive things differently at times, but we respect the other's opinion. Part of it is probably because she is my mother and she raised me, but I think the INFJ/ESTP combo is definitely a complimentary one. 
2	I think INFJs are hot. They are intriguing and I don't get them. I want to get them. They can get on my nerves. \n\nI don't like INFJs though. They seem dumb to me. I think that's just because of the way the INFJs I know have chosen to respond. If they liked me, I would like them. My Fe (ESTP Tertiary) is REALLY child-like. 
2	I loved the hell out of my ESTP ex gf but she didn't love me because she was a commitment-phobe. I felt for too long that it was me and I still do. 
2	One of my best friends is an INFJ and we get along really well. She laughs along at my antics and is really supportive of me. She also keeps me in line, allows me to consider other people's feelings and is great to reflect with about my emotions. \nI think that I help her to be a little more free and open to new experiences. \nINFJ & ESTP can be very complimentary in the right conditions.

5	Do you like INFPs?	I'm fond of you, guys. You look dangerous from far away, hardly approachable, but I was always curious about you. Being in your circle of friends, gives a sense of security. \n\nLove you being "down to earth", honest, straightforward, playful and living in the moment. But the most, that you are risk takers.\n\nWhat do you think about INFPs?
6	[deleted]
2	[deleted]
1	A lot of INFP's have said they like my personality type (estp) but surprisingly I don't have a lot of friends and am not very popular like most estp's
1	Music Thread Anyone?	This is what I've been focusing my energy on lately. Got a chance to meet Starset in Colorado, when I first saw Dustin, i lit up and he said "you made it" and shoke my hand. nothing like meeting someone who already knows you, but only communicated through dreams in space and time. \n\n[Starset - Transmissions](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6BsulcnTjtv3k03say7Z1RjihleUU5nE)\n\n[Celldweller - Wish Upon a Blackstar](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1D6DD43E59603DD3)\n\n[Code 64 -  Trialogue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKK5CttMDh4)\n\n[Code 64 - Leaving Earth](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB89It_zxWGKsbtZXHP36Km18FY736uhH)\n\n\n[Wideband Network - Universe](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzNDRR5BNRP2oiymzNHYNA-Zsp8MQdUYz)\n\n[Wideband Network - Singularity](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzNDRR5BNRP2bISI1qHttcX0G0fgyLaN3)\n\n[Glitch mob - love death and immortaily](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvLpqR9VfgDBZpl9D1wfdkyK_2--xT00B)\n\n[Glitch mob - Drink the Sea](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvLpqR9VfgDAf2NXmym06ac5fr9dq0j5L)\n\n[Encephalon - Psychogensis](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUSRfoOcUe4YXGx2LYKBTN8TU3f5gITLI)\n\n[Mind.In.A.Box - Memories](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLToxwys0ZSEK-NOqd01kJMAkrvkKLEhHD)\n\n[mind.in.a.box - Revelations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjIuADMrDKIYAWxu4bxbkhW37ohF1aqvv)\n\n[mind.in.a.box - crossroads](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLodn5lXLVMh1_D-sZC-FxrvIn4VrNEe0f)\n
7	Tell me about Se. Sincerely INFJ.	I am an INFJ looking for some inspiration from ESTPs. As you may know INFJ's inferior function is Se. In my case it not developped at all. I often feel too flighty and untied to the present reality, I would really benefit from being more assertive, persuading. \nSo my questions is, ESTPs show me how your Se is working. Some life examples? \n 
4	YEEEE Buddy. \n\nSe is literally JUST DO IT. The thing is, since it's dominant often I don't think about it. It manifests in us having a thought and reacting. It's a very 'sensor' type thing too, we have an idea so why would we need more?\n\nFor me, I often find that I bypass my auxiliary (Ti) for it. This has personally caused me problems because of the Se-Fe loop-- It has made me a bitch to be around, but it's something I'm working through.\n\nAct first, think later. I imagine you view it as fairly careless and it can be and especially when you have not developed it to act appropriately. \n\nI find myself fairly reactionary. Press the button to see how it works. Do stuff to understand. When interacting with N-types I've found that I NEED specific examples to understand a concept fully. \n\nAs for becoming different, I could only recommend being around an ESTP that you like(and likes you). I love most of the INFJs I've met but I find them getting easily frustrated with me combined with simply not understanding my thought process. There seems to be minimal respect for the way I think which hurts. This is pertaining to the couple friendshipss I've had with INFJs(which I've burned with the Se-Fe loop). Overall, I am super super super attracted to due to a LARGE amount of intrigue for the type generally. The large differences appear to make it easy to have friction though.\n\nI don't know, I just kind of typed different thoughts on this. I would love for another ESTP to post so I can compare the type vs just what is shitty about me haha.\n\nAlso, if you have any specific questions(mostly to arrange my thoughts and actually give you something useful) I can easily answer those..
1	I see an apple in front of me. At the same time a man is pointing his gun at my head. I'm hungry. So I ask the man to kindly bring the apple to me so I can eat it.\n\nI drop an apple on the ground. I quickly look around. I see nobody. I pick it up, wipe it off and eat it as if nothing has happened.\n\nI finish my apple. I see a trash can. So I (have to) throw it. 
2	Hello fellow STPs! I need some advice.	ISTP here, need some input.  I just recently met my girlfriends cousin, and just learned she's an ESTP.  Her and I have a lot in common, and I really like her.  My girlfriend and I have been together for three years, but are at the point where we both agree that we're not really compatible for a relationship and would be happier with other people.  Even my girlfriend thinks I should date her cousin.  \n\nMy question to you is: how do I know if she likes me, and is there any advice you can give me to maintain a relationship with an ESTP? \n\nShe seems like she's into me, but I don't know if she's just being really friendly.  She likes to tease me, often with insults.  Is that something all ESTPs do, or is that how you guys flirt?  Her and I talk a lot, though I usually initiate the conversations (I know you guys don't like to text much, but she seems to enjoy talking if we are talking about something interesting), but she usually prefers to talk on Skype when possible.  \n\nShe and I both share a lot of interests (shooting, driving, dangerous activities).  I have been tossing the idea around inside my head of becoming a police officer, I plan to start training as soon as I turn 18 (next April), and she has 6 more months of training and she will be a police officer.  I would think shared interests would be a bonus, but she always says opposites attract.  Do you guys like people that share interests with you, or people that are different?\n\nAny input or advice is appreciated.
3	Be honest, be forward, and be fun. All you need if you have decent looks/social skills. Don't just be a cocky dick head either. Forwardness is key in my experience.
3	Just be fun man. Do activities together, you're both STP, enjoy it ! \nDon't play games. Honest and direct always work for ESTPs. \n\nAnd if things ever get weird, awkward or confusing, just tell her :\n"Maybe making out for a few minutes would help us figuring things out"\n\nBest luck !
3	I'm a female ESTP and for the most part I am always more attracted to introverts in general. I tend to find extroverts too much. It tends to lead to this dangerous cycle of constant entertainment. My bf is an introvert and he keeps me grounded when I go too far.\n\nI say that to keep a relationship with an ESTP you need to be open to just doing a lot of random activities spur of the moment. Maybe surprise her with a date every once in awhile. Keep it interesting and be open to new possibilities. Be frank with how you feel. Don't hide things to protect her feelings.
2	ESTP Stereotypes that you break	I decided I'd make my own post here. Fellow ESTPs, are there any particular ESTP stereotypes that you break? Here are my own:\n\nActive: I'm really not. Like, I live in the moment and primarily absorb information via my senses but I am not all that active. I'm kinda lazy unless something catches my interest.\n\n\nNot interested in theories: I definitely get bored with abstract theories but I sometimes enjoy talking and thinking about them. I am good at understanding theories to an extent, I just get bored easily.\n\n\nSo, what ESTP stereotypes have ypu broken?
8	Introversion. I think a lot of ESTPs tend not to identify as ESTP because they spent a lot of time chilling alone or working on personal projects.
4	I don't know if it breaks a stereotype but i like physics. I don't consider it abstract theory i guess? It's certainly not a hands on activity.
5	I think that most people see ESTP's as being obnoxiously extraverted but I am pretty reserved. I quite like being by myself. 
1	Being an athletic person or Jock\n\nSure I like to occasionally watch and play soccer or run, but I am the opposite of what a Jock is.
1	I think I mostly fit the bill. Though, I think it is common for ESTPs to often be mistyped as introverts, as previously mentioned. "He who runs fastest runs alone" is a thought I've heard thrown around in the MBTI community about our type. 
2	What lifestyle preferences do you wish you could fully embrace but, because of outside pressures/expectations, feel unable to?	I have learned that many ESTPs, while perceptive of the ways others work, are not likely to give into a lifestyle just because many around them do or they receive pressure to. \n\nDo you think the general expectations society has regarding career, relationships, etc. "cramp your style?" How so?
4	I've never felt that I cannot do something due to outside pressures..if anything, that has fueled me to try harder to do whatever's in my sights to do.
3	Honestly I don't feel trapped by outside things that I dislike. I enjoy adapting to different lifestyles, and overcoming the "boundaries" of life is actually something I look forward to.

1	Please help, How to confront ESTP's lying behavior?	My boyfriend is ESTP, and I m INTP.  \n\nI caught him lying for the first time one month ago about him flirting with a girl.   \nHe was very sorry about it, and promised me will never lie to me in the future (...right...).   \nBut his behavior hasn't changed: he still talks to the girl, and lied to me he didn't.  \nAnd when I found out, he accused me for not trusting him enough(said by someone who destroyed trust  \nbetween us long ago.) \n\nSince my lie detector is now awaken, spotting his lies become a sport to me.  \nNow I realize he sometimes even lies about unrelated things, which doesn't make any sense to me.  \nWhen I confront him about his lying behavior, he will go all crazy!  \nI tried to be straight-forward: You were lying about xxxx, and the truth is yyyy.  \naaaaaaaaaand he gets offended.  \nI will have to peel the onion and get to the core step by step with him (like a child)  \nbefore he can admit he has been lying.  \nsomething like:  \n>>"You were doing xxxx this morning right? (yes.) But, yyy can't be true because zzzzz. So you must not have been doing xxxx, make sense?  and because I noticed you were doing tttttt, so you must been doing wwwww instead! Am I correct?"  \nThen he would admit he was indeed lying.  \nI m a very calm person, but he gets angry and frustrated when his lies are being exposed.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\ntl;dr: What should I do to make him realize lying is bad, especially his girlfriend is a very good lie detector?  \n(without making the whole situation emotional)  \n
2	ESTP are typically very headstrong. \nUnless he is ready to make the change himself its unlikely he will stop lying. \nIn his mind he probably doesn't think it is wrong of him to talk to this girl. \nThat's probably the reason why he is getting mad. He thinks you are looking for trouble when he is doing something normal.\nI am sure he has his own set of boundaries but if you feel neglected you need to somehow get him to value your opinion above his. \nMaybe instead of picking at his lies you should talk to him about the lack of respect he is giving you. \nAnd that your boundaries are different from his. If he cares about you he would respect them. \n\nIn my honest opinion I don't think he really values your feelings. And it doesn't seem like he ever will. Perhaps its time to cut your losses.

7	How do you guys feel about texting?	Hi,\n\nI have a few questions to you ESTPs : \n\n-How do you feel about texting and phone calls? Do you text a lot?\n-Can you hold a texting conversation or do you often forget to reply etc? \n-Do you prefer short or long texts/conversations? \n-Do you handle small talk? \n\nThanks!
7	I get bored relatively quick. At first I always respond, but later on I just want it to stop. I do call a lot. I always call people when walking to my car, or when I'm off doing groceries etc.
6	I always forget to reply. Calling has always been my preferred method
3	I forget to reply to text messages a lot. My phone is on me maybe 50% of the time, if you need me call.  Also I handle small talk well because I just love talking to people. It's nice to finally see some activity here. It's much needed. 
3	I like short text messages, and I rarely forget to reply. If someone wants to get really detailed, I will just call them and work it out. Much quicker. I hate talking on the phone, but I hate long ass text replies more. 
3	Hi, I hate texting!\nI prefer calling, especially if it's in response to a wall of text.\nI don't do small talk, or asking about people's day. I much prefer to talk one-on-one or call. I am notoriously bad at replying, especially to texts like: "Hi, how are you". Bleh. \nI do however, like to message my friends when something funny or dramatic happens :) I always have my phone on me though.
2	I find texting to be bothersome after a few. I frequently forget to respond... Multiple times. I will pick up the phone and cal for brief needs. No point in taking 10 minutes instead of a 2 minute phone convo. I dislike small talk. I avoid perfectly nice people I know so I don't have to have small talk. 
1	This has been on my mind for a good while now. I absolutely hate texting. It is impersonal, and you never get anywhere conversationally. I reply immediately and I never have time to wait around for people to respond, so conversation is always stuck in small talk (which I hate).  \nLast year I was in a relationship that was text-centric. We were always texting - and it was horrible. Conversely when we spent time together I always had to deal with her problems (which I don't like doing, but being a good boyfriend I did my best) so we never got anywhere deep conversationally.  \n  \n\nsorry for ranting. TL;DR Texting sucks and I hate it but do it anyway 
2	How can I tell you apart from an ENTJ?	Hi,\n\nI have a friend who I can't type properly, he's either ESTP or ENTJ. Both types often correlate with 8 so they sometimes lookalike to me. My friend is an 8 so he has a fiery temperament but it's just hard to tell which type he could be. Can you tell me how I can make the difference between you and ENTJs?
3	I'm an ESTP and my sister is an ENTJ. Let's take playing a sport for example: \nIf the two of us were playing volleyball, my sister's focus would be to win the game, no matter what. She doesn't care as much if she has fun doing it, she just plays for the outcome, for the victory, if you will. I play because it's fun. I enjoy spiking the ball and getting a service ace. I would prefer to win, but that isn't my overall goal. ESTPs like to show off, and ENTJs want to conquer. 
2	ESTPs are funny, ENTJs are assholes
5	ESTP in a constant need of meeting new people	it's been few months since I have been seriously studying MBTI types and now am at a point where I start to "type" all the people around me. So far I don't have an information of other ESTP out there, of course there are, but apparently not very close to me. I really need to talk to other ESTP's to better understand the type.\n\nBefore I found out about MBTI and and me as a ESTP, I was really always wondering why do I have such need to meet new people all the time? I even have a job that requires meeting new people constantly, besides most of the time I have to be the initiator of this meeting. Meanwhile, there are times when I don't talk to anyone and even in the busiest environment (party) can ignore everybody and just be in my own world.\n\nAll you, ESTP's out there, are you always eager to meet new people? Are there any here that don't feel like doing it and are good with the few they know?\n
2	I rather like to stick to my circle of friends, I don't mind meeting new people at all, but I don't focus my attention on it. If someone new shows up, I'm glad to have a nice chat and consider meeting the person again in a more private setting if he/she turns out to be interesting, but I don't mind if I stay with the people I know.\n\nBut then again my E and S ratios are close to zero, so I'm really much more of a thinker.
1	I'm a strong ESTP, by that I mean I am very one-sided on all four categories. I do have a constant desire to meet new people, which like you, I do everyday in my line of work. Meeting shy, introverted people is particularly interesting. I take it as a personal challenge to get them out of their comfort zone in some way. When I succeed, they become boring and I move on to the next person. \n\nI relate with your second point as well. I can keep to myself in social situations if the mood strikes. Sometimes just observing my surroundings is interesting enough to keep my attention. Pair that with the secondary trait of introverted thinking, and often times my own thoughts are enough entertainment.
1	I'm apparently ESTP now even though in the past I've been ENTJ, ISTP, INTJ.\n\nI'm a loner but I go out and meet people all the time.\n\nUsually it's easiest to get to know the host of whatever that event is.\n\nYou go to a place enough and you'll end up being a regular.\n\nI'm not going to advise on what that event is. You go figure out your hobbies.\n\n\n(EDIT: I'll add a bit more. \nOnce you hit regular status, it's a piece of cake to get comfortable with new people (in my case new women) that come in to the scene (in my case it's certain bar). It's a high chance that anyone who wants to meet "new people" are usually trying to date. It's like the only goal which people place incredible burdens and excuses upon themselves. I'm never really interested in "Bros" and "need a wingman, make a gameplan" types so if you are like me, you should find a good place and work on being a regular so that you can focus on people rather than people + territory.
0	I have to meet new people and if I'm not doing it in real life I'm doing it on tinder or some shit. Or talking to old friends on Facebook. Granted there is a 50% chance I am esfp but we are both similar in that regard. But I'd say if I had a choice I'd choose a small group of always loyal friends over a large group of acquaintances which is what I have now.
2	You wanna learn about artisans (SP's) in movies? Check this out!	\n\nhttp://youtopia.land/the-artisans-sps/
1	We thought learning about different characters in movies helps people learn better!
1	I don't really think James Bond is an ESTP :/
-1	Most actors are SPs. People don't think this is true but it is. SPs are the natural performers.
5	I wanna try something. If you pay for my travel, I'll come and spend a few days to a week being your best friend. I'll let you take on any adventures you wanna go and I'll listen to anything you wanna talk about. I love traveling and I want to meet new people. It's a crazy idea but it's worth a try.	***The only real requirement I have is that you can have a Skype/Hangouts-call (with cam!), so I can get a feel for you.***\n\nI don't really need much beyond that, I think any and all questions not covered here I can just bring up in that call. Any questions you have for me you can feel free to ask.\n\nI will try to chip in what I can when it comes to anything beyond the travel-costs, but I honestly can't promise anything. I don't have a lot of money to work with in the first place. \n\nI at least have myself, and hopefully that will be enough.\n\n**So,** ***"Who am I to demand that you pay?"***    \nReally, this is entirely up to you. If you don't want to do it then you don't have to, simple as that. I just thought I'd put this out there for anyone who thinks this would be a cool thing to do.\n\nI don't really know what else to add, if you guys have any questions then feel free to ask and I'll try to reply as best I can. I don't see this having to be something complicated or big, so I'm trying to keep it short.\n\n**Now then,** ***"Who am I?"***\n\nMy name is Sara, I'm 22 and I currently live in Sweden. I guess mentioning that I'm an INFJ would be relevant too.     \nI've traveled a few times in my life, and looking back on it I realized that those times were among the best of my life.\n\nI really enjoy making music, drawing, writing, and taking pictures, and I try to do one thing or another as often as I can (even though I'm not actually particularly good at any of those things yet, still working on it).\n\nIf there's anything in life I love, it's *experiences*. I love walking out late at night to a lake and sitting down to look at the stars. I love walking around town and exploring, going down an alley I've never seen before, and finding a restaurant I've never eaten at before. I love sitting down next to a homeless man in a park just to play chess with them and listen to them tell me their story.\n\nI also love cuddling into a sofa with a ton of blankets and pillows, finding a new movie to watch and then discussing the movie both while watching it and afterwards as well. I also love finding a new recipe, getting all the ingredients and trying to make something delicious while making the kitchen a mess. I also love walking around a festival, going to a stage where a band I've never heard before is playing, and getting myself lost in the energy of the crowd.\n\nAnd I love the little things, like stopping to pet every dog I walk by, or trying to make a cashier's day a little bit nicer by smiling at them. Or picking up some trash off the street and putting into a bin, or holding open doors for anyone who needs it. Or sitting down at 5am with a complete stranger, and giving them some heartfelt advice about life after they've drunkenly told me their story.\n\nI think most of all, I love writing, as you can probably tell by this long tangent. I love sharing all of the things I see and experience, because I know that all of these things make me really happy and all I really want is to make other people just as happy too.\n\nThat's why I so desperately want to travel, because I want to see everything that life has to offer, so that I'll have more things to share.\n\nI don't really know what else to say about me to be honest. Those are things I feel is the most important to me. There's a lot more to me, but I'm sure we'll get to that all in due time.\n\n---\n\nThis is a crazy idea, I understand that, but I just hope that there's someone out there who's just as crazy as me.\n\nComment or PM me, and tell me a little about yourself.\n\nThis is a genuine offer to anyone who's willing to take it.\n\nThanks for reading.

2	Ok, I just deleted my rant regarding my estp brother. He's constantly  asking me for money.  \nYour free ride request is very dangerous imo.  That being said, what are your hopes? I wish you safe journey, be careful.  
1	ENFP AMA	Heeey, ENFP here!! I've gotten the feeling that although our types click there is still a bit of misunderstanding at times. Wondering if you guys wanted to do a Q&A? :)
1	What are your honest opinions on estps?
1	How do you feel about self-improvement? Is it something you place importance on?\n\nIf so, what have you realised in recent times that you felt the need to change about yourself and did you succeed?
1	ESTP checking in. What is your guiding principle?

3	Any ESTPs who think they might be ENTP/mistyped as ENTP?	I'm an ENTP who has gotten ESTP on tests before and often feels ESTP.  Apparently ENTPs being mistyped as ESTPs isn't rare; is that true for ESTPs being mistyped as ENTPs?
3	Most MBTI tests give me ENTP, yet this one test gave me ESTP, So I am wondering whether there is any test that's really reliable.\n\nThis is the only test I took that typed me as ESTP, all other do ENTP: http://www.keys2cognition.com/explore.htm\nUnfortunately for it, it didn't exactly type me right, seeing as:\n\n>Extraverted Sensing (Se) & Extraverted Intuition (Ne)\n\n>The primary purpose of the eyes is extraverted perception. Hence, it does not seem unreasonable to predict the eyes to be most active—darting, toggling, and looking around—when an individual is using an extraverted Perceiving function (Se or Ne).\n>As discussed in my e-book, The 16 Personality Types, Se attunes to actualities and concrete details of the immediate environment. It is quick to notice sensory changes or physical movements, which is why SPs often excel in activities like team sports or emergency medicine. The eyes of SP types often appear wide and alert. Since Se is not a verbal function (especially not a “explorative” verbal function like Ne) and its primary focus in a one-to-one conversation is the interlocutor’s physical expressions and responses, ESPs are less likely to appear distracted when conversing than ENPs are (assuming the ESP isn’t terribly bored or restless). This likely ties into what CT describes as the Se “lock in,” in which the Se user locks their gaze onto the person they are speaking with.\n\n>Unlike Se, Ne is unconcerned with the concrete details or happenings of the immediate environment. Rather, it is interested in scanning for new ideas, connections, and possibilities. Despite the fact that much of this scanning is mental (N) rather than sensory in nature, when Ne is engaged, the eyes can often be seen darting broadly from side-to-side, as if they were looking around for something. This alone may contribute to ENPs’ reputation for appearing distracted, flighty, and scattered, which is only bolstered by the random, disjointed, and scattered musings of NP types.\n\nBasically says Se could never be my thing considering I usually don't lock eyes when talking to someone, except when I consciously notice someone.
4	Yea, i got mistyped as 1 last year. It comes from the way we can emulate other people, i think anyway. Depends on stress.
1	I'm an ESTP and sometimes I get mistyped as ENTP. \n\nSo, yeah, it happens. 
1	Some people I would have pegged as ESTPs actually end up identifying as ISTP after I coax them into taking a look at MBTI. I think that's one of those 'state of mind' or 'time of life' situation where you can kind of be both all in a day.
1	I was pretty sure I was ENTP for a good while till I really looked into MBTI properly and realised that I identify with the functions and shit of ESTP more than I do ENTP. 
0	I just took an MBTI test for fun a little while ago and it typed me as an "ENTP" instead of ESTP. It's generally agreed upon that the tests are inaccurate due to stereotypes and that functions are where it's at when it comes to typing yourself correctly. That all being said, I think mistypes happen a lot between ESTPs & ENTPs. Especially, with the test-taking route.
-6	ENTPs are clumsier and less popular than ESTPs.
6	Why do other types describe us as douche bags?	New to the community, and through my browsing of all of the types it has been repeatedly stated that us as ESTP's can be categorized as douchebags or assholes. Why?
3	Because they don't understand our badassery.
7	INFJ here, I don't think they are the terms I would use . I would say that ESTPs can lack self awareness and do not like to admit they have problems like everyone else does.They are good at living in the moment which I admire, INFJs tend to live in the past/future.They also don't take life too seriously which is something I wish I could do, but perhaps this easy going attitude might piss off more serious types at times?

8	ENTPs can be similar, it's a result of Fe loops. ESTPs are the most physically aggressive type alongside ISTP.
4	INFJ\n\nUnhealthy ESTPs can fall into that category. I know some amazing ESTPs, they're in the now mentality can be wonderful and freeing, but It has to be balanced. \n\nUnhealthy ESTPs are obnoxious though. I know a particularly bad one that manages to come off as selfish and insecure. I think it's really damaged Fe. Unhealthy ESTPs live too in the moment, don't keep up with tasks, and get mad when everyone doesn't live 'like them'. Or 'I don't want to do that with my life' to responsibilities.

1	I think people think of the ESTP frat boy stereotype automatically. Careless, douchey, life of the party, live in the moment, doesn't think of long term consequences, etc. I think they are also seen as the "dumb" thinkers because of this.\n\nOut of any type I find ESTP to be the most charming and fun; you guys are good at reeling us in and keeping our interest. We are as interested in seeing what's going to happen next with you as much as you are interested in seeing what will happen with us. You guys deserve a lot more credit.
1	You guys are fun douchebags. Don't take it personally. ESFPs are called attention whores. It's because it's true.
1	The continuum aspect of all of this is so new to me, but thank you guys for your responses! It has helped me better understand the types, ESTP's and myself. Glad to have joined the community!
1	[deleted]
1	I admit that I have found estj's/estp's to be assholes, but that's only bc I'm comparing their behavior to what's important to me. I value good manners and being tactful, so seeing someone that's blunt and abrasive may raise my eyebrows. However, I understand that not everyone is like me and some people just can't help their natural personality.  On the flip side, some estp's might see me as weak and passive. I disagree , as I just see myself as not feeling the need to be blunt and "in your face" with everyone. It's all about different perspectives. 
3	Am estp now what	So I've taken this test over and over, I'm ESTP. I suppose that makes sense, I can be fairly bold I guess.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like they need to get something DONE, but they don't know what it is, and everything seems kind of pointless unless there is some significant..achievement to it.\n\nDoes anyone also constantly need distractions, or really like distractions? For example if I'm playing video games I like to listen to podcasts at the same time, or if I'm mowing the lawn I'll go deep into some kind of thought about the world and what not\n\nI honestly just made this cause I was bored, and I want to relate to you ESTPS!
3	I focus on making money. Have gotten pretty good at it. So I focused on getting beautiful girl. Got one. Now I am just reveling in my superiority to my generation. And trying to quit drinking and smoking so much...
1	I'm in the same boat. I feel like I need to be sparked and then I'll just fly 
1	I might be ENTP, I feel the exact same way lol
0	I always need to distractions. It must be a Se thing. I need to multitask to get anything done.
2	I'm in need of some help.	Hello all, INTP lady here, married to an ESTP guy. Was just wondering if you all could give me some insight into how best to motivate my fellow in regards to housework. I've worked out a few different ways to ask before but I never end up following through because I don't want to feel like I'm nagging. It's in both of our natures to not really notice clutter, or to let the house go without a good cleaning for long periods of time. But I'm trying to change that (2 kids and a dog will do that to you) and, being stuck in my own head a lot, I find myself resenting him when I feel that I'm bearing more of the load but I never know how to express it to him. Thanks y'all, any and all help is appreciated.
6	"here is a list of things we need to do. I have already started on a few things but if you can help me with task 3 and 5, maybe we can go (play some lazer tag or have sex or some other example of a fun activity) tonight.
4	Why not be straight up with him? Have you had communication issues in the past? \n\nIn my personal experience, if someone asks me to do something; I'll always do it but on my own time. I hate it when someone asks for me to do something "right now"
3	Looks like you have a lot of replies already, but I'll still tell you how I feel.\n\nI love it when people are straight forward with me, when people, women especially start beating around the bush, I get tired of it very quickly and demand what is truly on your mind.\n\n\nDon't beat around the bush.\n\nI also hate when people give the silent treatment, or if they act like I'm supposed to know whats wrong.
1	I find it easier to do things I don't like doing (like cooking) when we are doing it together. Maybe if your schedules work out you can do chores together and maybe ask him to think of one or two he doesn't mind doing that need to be done once a week at some point. Definitely communication is key though, let him know that you don't want to feel like your nagging but it is a shared responsibility that he needs to be a part of. 
1	Look, no one likes to do housework, so the good news is you are on the same page.\n\nWhy not make a schedule of "who is in charge of housework this week" and stick it on the fridge? \n\nThe responsibility is clearly divided so everyone will know who to blame when the house becomes a mess over a week.
1	Ask to help NEVER demand
2	estp x esfp	how does this friendship work
3	tons of fun but little depth
1	what exactly are you asking? how do they get along? or how do they interact with each other?
1	my sister is also an estp and her boyfriend is an esfp. they're good together
0	Lots of chaos and destruction
1	To be an ESTP or not to be?	I always get ESTP each time but I have a low E. Like in the ten percent range or lower. I took the 16 personality test which is very accurate multiple times. So should I call myself an ISTP? Even though I wouldn't say I'm most introverted because I don't get drained from social interactions however I'm a loner since I just never cared about making friends and dealing with the whole process of it. 
7	I've heard our type described as: "He who runs fastest runs alone." Social interaction is interesting and stimulating, but we do not require friendships as others might. With the ESTP charm and ability to make others feel comfortable very quickly, anyone can be made into a "friend" in a social setting, but that doesn't mean we will make the effort to maintain the friendship. Most people are only interesting for a short amount of time, then the game is over and it's on to the next person. 
3	[deleted]
3	I'm an ESTP and I have pretty much the same attitude. I dont avoid people or consider myself a loner, but I just dont care enough to put much effort into making friends or pursuing women, so most relations are sparked by someone else kind of making me hang out with them at first.
2	Favorite movies?	I'm curious what kind of movies do you guys like? :)
5	The Princess Bride
4	I have too many favorite movies across too many genres but overall I think my preferences lean toward comedies.
4	Off the bat:\n\nThe classic Hitchcock Films- Psycho, Rear Window, Vertigo  \nSe7en  \nLucky Number Slevin  \nWarrior  \nFight Club  \nWhiplash  \nAmerican History X  \nAmerican Beauty  \nThe Godfather  \n\nI have a lot. Pretty much anything that lets me enjoy the ride and leaves me with something after. The ones I listed stayed in my immediate memory so they must be special
3	I enjoy comedies. As well as some independents and movies like: Limitless, Inception, Interstellar, and such things. However, I don't find myself watching movies frequently. 
2	Airplane is my all time favorite. Followed by most American Sports movies. 
2	Pulp Fiction. 
2	I knew most of these would be generally shitty. 
2	Fear and Loathing in Vegas, The Matrix Trilogy, Fight Club, Clockwork Orange. Also love comedy's and documentaries 
1	Bladerunner is my absolute favorite!
1	Oceans 11,\nThe Usual Suspects,\nthe most recent Star Trek movies,\nNolan's Batman films,\nThe Lord of the Rings series,\nThe Shawshank Redemption,\nThe Lincoln Lawyer,\nPrimal Fear, etc.\nMostly I like action, heist and drama
1	I don't really like movies. Perks of Being a Wallflower is good, though. I prefer sitcoms. My favorites are as follows (in order of preference): \nHow I Met Your Mother\nScrubs\nParks and Recreation\nThat 70's Show\nNew Girl\nThe Unbreakable Kimmie Schmidt
1	Mostly Independent movies. I love when I discover something Fresh and it makes me think about it for day's. 
2	Ever been with an enfp?	Hi! enfp here,\n\nJust wondering are you or were you ever in a relationship with an enfp? How did it go? What was good? What was bad? \n\nI recently ended my relationship with an estp but it was not until it was over that either of us found out our types.  So now i have the question how big of a role did our types play in our problems.\n\nThank you for your insights. 
5	I've never been with an ENFP, but I have a tooooon of friends who type as an ENFP. I like the positivity they have about the world and they're really great at conversation. However, when you look at how the cognitive functions stack up, we really see the world quite differently from one another. I love ENFP's but there are times that they flat out frustrate me -- such as they really don't tell you when they're upset with you (and don't really give a direct answer), they really try to see the best in everyone and I just don't work that way... I go off by your actions, and I don't know what it is but I get slightly annoyed frequently by them (assuming due to how cognitive functions stack up). Now, of course, this is from me analyzing my friends who are ENFP's and have tested as ENFP, so I'm generalizing a bit. But I think they're also hella fun to be around too. 
2	ENFP is the type that I am able to build the closest friendships with. The girl I've had my longest relationship with was maybe an ENFP. They're a decent match for us I think. I've not really fought about anything with my ENFP friends but the main differences is they tend to dream a bit more and aren't as focused on the present and don't really value material things as much as others might.
2	Yes I have actually! When I identified as one too.\n\nIt was spontaneous but always on edge. We craved stability but we felt very vulnerable about it. And over time I guess we learnt to be vulnerable around each other. Can't say it ended while though it did on my side.
0	estp	how can i find out in more specific detail about this estp
2	read about estp
1	A good place to start could be http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESTP\n\nIf you ask a more specific question, we might be able to give you a more specific answer?
7	Excellent video on ESTPs	
0	ESTP vs ESTJ	
5	Girl with bar code on her forehead talks to God. Okay. 
2	If you met yourself, what would your first impression of yourself be like?	
19	What a dick... 
11	i'd like how straightforward and confident other me was, but i'd probably be a bit jealous/annoyed too.  like "ugh that bitch thinks she's all that because she's oh so cool and confident and ~different~"
1	Who knows, I have a hard enough time understanding what I'm all about I'd probably be best friends with myself though
1	I'd fuck me.
6	What it's like being alone for ESTPs?	How hard it is for you to spend time alone? \nI imagine it can be very difficult since you are extroverts and need a lot of stimulation but maybe I'm wrong?\nWhat kind of things do you like to do when you have to spend some time alone for some reason?
7	I basically do the same things I would do with other people when I'm by myself. It's just not quite as fun. 
6	Alone time forces me to be introspective and to think deeply about one thing or another... because the alternative is boredom. \n\nIf i am alone all those fun things will eventually get kind of stale. I will seek out people. But if i was stranded alone but "safe" and thusly bored and fat...\n\nI guess either i would find a way to destract myself or end up doing alot of thinking... not all of that thinking would be positive... i might become moody and dark. Start working on project that dont really mean anything to me because i would have no one to share them with.\n\nMy best days would become those where i conquered something... but with out people to brag about it to.... the joy would be short lived. I am not so interested in mastering anything, rather proving that i could if i wanted to.\n\nI know this because I had a tough home life and was forced to become very introverted for years In order to survive. I got depressed... it sucked... i am good now. i can for sure say now that solitude wont kill me, but it will make me a bit crazy. I was tough but it felt like i was dead Everyday And like i wanted to run away buy i couldn't.\n\nI was never so emo that i cut myself.. but i became self-destructive in other ways. I got angry and a bit violent Or intense... even if inside i just wanted to be chill... but how could i be chill when i wanted to scream and beat the shit out of anyone in my way. 
5	I think that's to much of a generalisation. \nI do prefer to be around others but I'm just as content and comfortable being alone. \nI rank as highly extraverted but I do get tired of certain types of people. Alone can be preferable when the alternative is dull.. \n
3	OwO  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.4628  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/23849)
3	I prefer time alone. I watch TV, go on the computer to play games or work on my mod for a PC game. People usually require things of me and it is rarely something I want to do.
1	I rather enjoy time by myself, being with people is nice as well, I feel full of energy after a nice night out.
3	ESTP friend	Hello, my friend and I, (ENFP, INFP respectively) recently typed our buddy as ESTP. We want to get interact with him as good as possible, so naturally we came to the source! Can you help us with some things?\n\n-How to deal with attention-mongering\n\n-Dealing with him ALWAYS having to be the center of attention\n\nIn general, we just want to communicate and become closer friends. Please give every tip you can think of!
3	I'm not sure how to deal with attention mongering, it's really something one seems to learn over time as it's pointed out or when you reflect upon situations. I've noticed that when I feel excluded, like when other people are going on about sports I know nothing about, I sort of switch into 'observe' mode (begrudgingly).\n\nMy advice is to let her/him feel completely expressed. Let them talk over an issue or idea 10 times if they have to, eventually it becomes burnt out and the excitement turns a little sombre. Bring it up 10 times so they'll have told you everything they can tell you about it ('it' being the concept or idea monopolising the conversation).\n\nYou could also find things they're good at and put them in a position to 'show off' how good they are able to do that thing. In my experience, when people are watching my successes it makes me feel less pressure to get everyone riled up with a good discussion on the things I want to talk about.\n\nUnfortunately, you're dealing with a group of people who lose interest very quickly for things that aren't 'my idea.' As such, I'm struggling to finish this comment and am instead thinking of just deleting the whole thing because it doesn't really matter anyway.\n\nI'm not usually one to advocate taking drugs or anything, but I do want to mention that taking a large dose of Psilocybin mushrooms completely and permanently changed my awareness to this issue you're bringing up. I can't explain it, but for years since that one time I did it I still have moments of internal monologue during group conversations when I think about that experience, and it's something like "What are you doing being so yippity about this thing you're explaining? Just settle and let other people have a turn to participate."
2	has he taken a test to assure he's an estp? I find alot of people mistype people based off actions and simple questions. 
1	why is his behavior a problem?
4	ENFP > ESTP?	Recently, I've been through a couple of serious events in my life and i realised that my mbti has changed from enfp > estp but there are rumours that changing your mbti isn't possible. Any thoughts or similar experiences?
2	Of course you can change? That's like saying you were same person now as you were 20 years ago.\n\nThings happen, experiences like life and death situations can make massive changes to our personalities.\n\nI also think people change more the younger they are but as they get older they become more 'cemented' in your ways.\n\n\nThis is just my opinion obviously...
2	There might be a chance you'd switch within the same function group. But switching functions is unheard of without major brain damage or some drastic change to your personality.\n\nYou'd have to pretty much be completely different and unrecognizable.\n\nMore likely you've just mistyped one of the times. Since mistyping is incredibly common.
2	Of course you can change!\n\nI used to be an ENTP, and now I'm an ESTP
1	People can change, but their instincts don't. Why did you think you were ENFP? Why do you think you're an ESTP?
1	I recently saw a video called "the biology of belief" it would agree that personalities can change rather easily, and it's backed by science. 
1	so im not alone(estp),good2know there's other like-minded people out there.i think the test is about 85-90% accurate.its interesting,bt im not blown over\n
9	Do you ever struggle with boredom?	
8	I wouldn't say boredom as much as apathy. I've got so many projects on the go and it seems like none of them can hold my interest long enough to be completely finished to the end.
4	I get restless a lot. I can't sit still for very long at all and in high school i was the guy who would always bounce his leg under his desk. My restlessness/boredom has also somewhat shaped my lifestyle. My favorite days are busy days from sunrise to sunset. I find that filling my day with different activities makes me feel great whereas if i just watch TV or have "down time" i shortly begin to feel lethargic and even a little depressed. I completely don't understand the idea of "down time" **So yes i do struggle with boredom at my 9-5 right now.**
3	I have to do multiple things at the same time. I can't watch TV - too boring. I can't just do one thing: it is boring.
2	Boredom is basically my worst fear. I can't handle boredom. I'm bored as fuck right now. It's rainy and I can't go outside. Fuck it, maybe I'll go outside anyway.
1	Between poker, tetris and netflix - I can always find something to do. If those aren't cutting it, then the gym or a personal project fills my time.\n\nIn the wise words of Kendrick Lamar: "Get some ambition while you're bored"
1	I smoke weed, so I don't get bored as often, but yea I do get bored! I feel like I need to get something DONE sometimes, something amazing, I don't know what that is though.
5	What makes you angry?	What makes you angry and how do you express your anger?\n
16	People who don't understand simple concepts. \nPeople who need every detail clarified before doing something - like being explained an activity when you could learn as you go.\nPeople who try to assume leadership but don't know what they're talking about.\nHa, so summed up; people who are indecisive, and people who overthink. \nI am not outwardly angry but I probably make them feel a bit under pressure.
10	People who tell me "no, stop doing that" or who try to shut me down. Those people are the absolute worst in my head. People who call out other people in front of friends in general make me pretty angry.\n\nUsually I'll get really awkward or just leave when I get angry in a group.
5	People who say I want to do x and then when it comes around they only half ass it.\nAn example would be a group of us came up with the idea to do a power paint fight and one girl was really excited about it. The day came round, we were about to start and she starts saying don't get it on my face, don't throw it at me too much. Really??
3	Tradition for tradition's sake. Nothing makes me angrier than the words, "That's just how it is." Some people think since they do something a certain way, all other ways are wrong and stupid; that's so narrow minded and judgmental. \n\nThe fear of trying new things frustrates me to death as well. I am dating a girl who, so far, refuses to try new things, and refuses to give me answers as to why. For example, I really enjoy playing sports and exercising and I just want to do something active with her. She is collegiate athlete, but she is unyielding so far at my attempts to bring her to the gym or when I ask her to play a sport with me. 
3	What makes you angry, [u/color_flow](http://www.reddit.com/user/color_flow)?
3	Violations of consumer rights, it happens a lot everywhere but you just don't hear about it too much. I'm kind of shy on preordering games because some triple A titles hype up old games with new faces with ass loads of day one DLC and preorder bonuses and not to mention console exclusive content. It honestly makes my skin crawl just thinking about it.
0	I had a clash with an I-something (I don't remember her exact combination anymore) last summer. We worked in the same dev team, and I just went nuts by her over thinking and over discussing everything. When I spent an hour coding, refactoring, and refactoring again (learning my doing, folks), she sat looking out the window building a solution concealed in her mind. 
4	ENTP/ESTP Partners in crime?	I'm ENTP and (sadly) recently lost my ESTP best friend (drinking and drugs, wish I could say it was a surprise to anyone) but it got me reminiscing on our time together and how strangely perfect we were as "partners in crime."\n\nFortunately, our crimes only involved minor stuff, but the way we worked together was beautiful... He was the aggressive face/muscle that made moves and kept me from getting too caught up in my head/possibilities while I helped him maneuver at a much higher level, proposing new connections/opportunities/ways of doing things he wouldve never been able to conjure...\n\nHad we not been decent guys, I could see this really escalating into some supervillain-type behavior...both charming, suave, manipulative, lovable, and neither of us possessing the ability to reign in our behavior or slow down...\n\n\nHave any of you had friendships with ENTPs?  How well did you get along/play off each other?\n\n\n\n\n
6	I have a good friend who is an ENTP. I myself sort of walk the line between ESTP and ENTP though, so I'm not sure if my point of view is really all that accurate, but I can tell you that it's definitely a compatible thing. Just look at Mac and Dennis from "It's always sunny in Philadelphia." Mac is the ESTP and Dennis is the ENTP. They're always coming up with crazy schemes for the bar. (Dennis may be more of an ENTJ though, so I might be wrong about that)
2	I've had a couple ENTP friends and we honestly get along great. The whole devil's advocate thing makes me mad sometimes, but I also see all view points so it kinda works out. I find ENTP's are one of the few that will actually go on adventures with me. I have this one ENTP friend in particular and I would def say when we get together it a whirlwind... definitely partners in crime. 
2	I've got an ENTP as a man friend and it really does feel like we're partners in crime. We've only known each other a few months, but it seems like every time there is something for us to work together on we can pretty much read each others minds to get the job done as efficiently as possible. It's nice (: 
2	Favorite quotes	Do you have any favorite quotes or perhaps a personal motto that keeps you going? 
9	"All men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds, wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act on their dreams with open eyes, to make them possible."\n\nIt's a T.E Lawrence quote but I heard it in Uncharted.

2	An old friend once said "At the end of the day; it's night" which I love! I always say it to myself for reassurance.

1	ESTPs needed for a survey on sleep patterns and personality	edit: 6/30 ESTPs have taken this survey. I need 24 more. Thanks!\n\nHello Everyone! I am undertaking a project to investigate the relationship between people's personalities and their sleep patterns. This survey will be posted in all MBTI related forums- if you could take it, I would greatly appreciate your time. It is pretty brief, and at the end there is the option to see the descriptive results (percentages of each response to see how you stack up to your fellow redditors). Once I have a sufficient number of participants, I will analyze the data to find correlations between different traits, and then post any interesting findings from the data. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lW19vAWhfaGu_MBDWkZl2KrJkTTGj3nXSvZJOTvEJhg/viewform If this goes well, this could be the first installation in an interesting social science series! Thanks!
2	Heads up: the personality traits on the second page don't line up with the results of that quiz, may lead to some significant errors in data
2	Apparently i'm an ESTP	Hey people!\n\nSo, i took a personality test yesterday and i got ESTP as a result.(Took one a few years back and got INTP) This result kind of surprises me. I can relate to many things in the results, such as being adventurous and always wanting something new to happen but one thing i cannot really understand is how i got the E. \nIn would not really say that i'm an introvert, i enjoy being in other peoples company, but being described as being the center of attention feels nothing like me. At times i need to retreat and just be for myself for a while (which i generally think is a trait of the Introverted?) Also, i dint think i notice small cues at all. This is not all the points that i disagree with from the results but im not gonna list it all. \n\nI simply just want to ask, how much do you people differ from the results you got? Is it spot on, or do you have some things that you cannot recognize either?\n\nI feel ESTP is the most fitting for me, but i still do see alot of differences :)
6	a lot of times people get hung up on the first letter, because that's one of the more easy to determine.\n\nRealize that you don't have to be 100% E and 0% I.  it's a continuum...you might just be 51% / 49%.\n\nEveryone needs some time to themselves, just as we also like to be in some people's company...the question is what's the situation?\n\nFor you: it's the end of an average week, you've been doing work/school/whatever you do. You got a full night of sleep last night. It's now Friday night and you have the whole weekend to yourself. Would you rather go out to a bar with a group of 6 friends; or, would you rather meet one friend at a coffee shop?  An E would probably naturally gravitate toward the bar, whereas the I would rather do the coffee shop. Do Es go to coffee shops and hang out? of course! Do Is go to loud bars? Yes.  But let's say you had to do it every night. The I would not be happy having to do the bar every night. The E would feel bored in the coffee shop.\n\nESTPs don't have to be the *center* of attention, but they want to be near it for sure.\n\nI love going out to the loud, crazy dance party; a honeymoon spent rafting/ziplining/paragliding sounds great; teach a fitness class is fun.  However, I also like to have one great conversation off to the side of that party; while on the honeymoon I also want to lay in the sun next to the ocean for a little while listening to beautiful music; and I like to be a student in the back of the yoga class without any attention.
2	Also, I clicked on your name to look at your recent posts...you certainly give off the STP vibe: focused on details of the game (colors, speeds, etc) - S, not focused on feelings (stating "I disagree with you") - T, playing the game as it is (not concerned with records) - P.\n\nthat's a simplistic analysis, but it seems to line up.
1	im apparently an estp,i think it got a gud 85-90%accuracy of me.\n
2	Where do I find one of you as a friend?	I'm an ENFP who used to live with an ESTP roommate, and I really enjoyed how he helped me get out of my head and just enjoy the moment. You guys are also fun as fuck to adventure with! Where would be a good place to find you guys in a city like Chicago?
7	[deleted]
1	I'm currently floating in space waiting for a pick-me-up.
3	What's the most fun thing you ever did?	Well?
5	Traveling alone to different countries. I went on two separate last minute trips to Chile and Japan by myself and had so much fun meeting new people and partying. Can't wait to choose where to go on my next trip!
3	For me would be storming the court (College Basketball) after my school beat the #3 team in the nation earlier this season. Was able to share the moment with my SO and tons of friends. \n\nOr skydiving.\n\n
1	The funnest thing I ever did was take magic mushrooms, best night of my whole life. If I had to choose a sober time it was when I went to Las Vegas when I was 17, I had a blast believe it or not!
-1	Masturbated.
3	Explaining to an ESTP that I don't want to hang out every day?	I'm an INTP. I have a friend who's textbook ESTP (tested and confirmed) who I've become quite close with recently. We get along great and she's an awesome friend with whom I have a lot of fun. That being said, she seems to want to hang out with me literally every day and it's way overbearing. Even if I had the time to hang with her daily, I don't think I'd want to. Being an introvert, I need my alone time and appreciate being able to relax and sort through the day's thoughts Ti-Si style. \nI don't want to make her think that I don't want to hang out with her or be around her. I don't think post-poning her requests would work, since she asks almost daily. How do I deal with this? What do   I say to let her know that I can't hang with her every single day, while still making it clear that I do what to be around her in a general sense? She doesn't really know MBTI well, so I'm hesitant to use the "I'm an introvert and you're an extravert" explanation, because I think it would be a waste of time that would be largely lost on her. She took the test at my request (suspected she was ESTP and wanted to be sure) and that was the extent of her exploration.
3	tell her you need alone time to recharge and then plan a specific time to hang on a day like 3 days later. it tells her that you for sure wanna hang but you can't till a few days later. so you give a concrete date that hanging out will happen so it doesn't look like you are just brushing her off, but it also gives by default like 3 days where you probably wont wanna hang. And if she texts or calls on those days, you can say you can't but that you cant wait for sat. But if you do wanna hang, you can hang.\n\n\nIts flexible while still establishing what you need and want. \n\n\nAnd you dont have to tell her all about personalities... just say "ya know how you love to do shit and it energizes you?... well being alone to read and contemplate shit be a mad scientist by myself makes me happy and energized... but can we hang on tuesday, maybe go sky diving or drinking or something?"\n\n\nJust say what you mean... no need to delve into the science unless we ask... just give us the facts/tools to do what is required. "Naw man, i need sime alone time to chill. oh but hey you wanna go do x on yday? Cool, see ya then."\n\n\nBoom.
2	ESTP's are like wild attention seeking horses. We'll always come back to someone we respect as a friend if they hit us up to hang out. 9 times out of 10.
1	Lmao, I was spending every day with my two new friends last year, one tells me, dude, we need like 1 day to be by ourselves. I was like oh, okay. I have no problem being with people all the time, I was a bit taken aback at first lol
6	ESTPs What kind of music do you like?	...and why do you like it?\nYou can mention favorite songs n shit...
6	[deleted]
3	EDM, heavy metal, anything loud, fast, and def not "chill" lmao 
2	This https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukZJq_qre9U\n\nthe song was mixed well with warframe,\nbadass space ninja fighting like fricken machines
1	I like hip hop and metal mostly. I can't stand most techno or anything electronic
3	What everyone fails to understand?	What is something about you that nobody seems to understand and you think it's related to your type?
3	Mmmm. Well as an ESTP I think a lot of people underestimate us. I think people fail to notice that ESTP's are some of the best body language readers there are due to our main function being Extraverted Sensing. As well as we can be "organized introverts". 
2	Oh what he said. We get underestimated a lot. Since we are such adept readers of people we usually end up being the hardest to read of the personalities. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlso most people will think we lie when we boast so much about being adept sportsmen, outdoors men and overall badasses. We read environments as well and fast as people meaning we can make those split second educated calls that can both save lives and propel us to greatness.  Most of the famous ESTPs come from military fame, and we'll back up anything and everything we say so if you challenge an ESTP to a match of physical prowess you better bring your A game.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis makes us extremely cocky. But you know, flattery will get you everywhere with us.\n
3	Being chased?	ESTPs are known for enjoying the chase,but do you enjoy it when you're the one being chased? What is your reaction when someone is openly trying to pursue you romantically? Does it flatter you or does it turn you off? How do you behave then?
8	To be honest, I'm pretty oblivious when I'm being chased. 
5	Am I gonna have to chase you for more replies? I need some insight here people! *grabs shotgun* 
3	... i am the hunter... you wanna hunt me i will fight you...test you... Maybe be kind of mean... or maybe be kind of annoyed. Impress me and you might have an in. Otherwise get out of my way.\n\nBest chance is to just be my friend and have adventures with me... be a bit flirty but JUST out of my grasp... i will chase. I will impress... i will catch. Or move on. 
3	Turn off. Really really hate it.
2	They rarely get my attention, and if they do I quickly lose interest. I mostly don't even notice when I'm chased, because I'm too busy chasing.
2	I'm usually oblivious to it, except if there is excess physical contact . Usually I can't tell if a women is chasing me, but recently one of my female friends was walking next to me and basically rubbing up against me. I may be oblivious, but I'm not stupid. Once I figure out someone is chasing me, I usually enjoy it.
1	Come check out /r/sensor	Hey fellow Realists.\n\nTired of condescension, scrolling through walls of boring text, intuitive ramblings, and nerdy discourse?\n\nHead over to /r/sensor, a fun sub where anyone is welcome and we don't turn down for nothing.\n\nxoxo,\n\nThe mods at /r/sensor
2	How do you guys deal with defeat?	I gave up on an entrepreneurial project I was working on because I was losing optimism/passion, and it was a huge defeat to my foundation. \n\nCurrently, I have no ambition or motivation, and it's an unpleasant feeling because I don't feel my natural energy/drive. I know losing motivation is a common ESTP problem, do you guys have any creative ways to turn yourself around? \n\nBooks?\nMovies?\nActivities?\nVolunteering?\nSleeping Around?\n\n
2	I just come up with new interests to keep me distracted until I get back in the groove. However, this isn't really a good solution because my current "hobby" is stealing from people I don't like. So, just find something new to do, but try not to be too destructive.
2	Don't dwell on it. Find a new goal. Dont connect defeat to your identity.
1	sleeping around and working out
1	I rely on others to keep me going.\nWhen o have failed, I just changed interests. I tried to set up a website building business. It started quite well, but after a few years I had run out of customers. So I switched to Religious Studies teaching.
1	Drop as much as you reasonably can from your life, use the extra time to reflect on what you wanted to get out of the project, what you actually ended up getting (both good and bad), and why you lost motivation. Take small steps toward new goals (for example, if you want a car, go get your license, or if you want to start another business, go to a conference or seminar). Use your knowledge of what you enjoyed about your venture to recalibrate and set a new goal. The rest is easy; grab opportunities, break out of your comfort zone, and keep doing you.
1	I work out a lot. Its supposed to help you focus but i do it to let off steam. Funny movies too
1	as I've seen before, I try and pick up a new hobby, or go out with a bunch of new people, or get into something that really catches my eye. Typically anything new, action-oriented, and I can use my thinking with
3	Goals, discipline, a new year	Happy 2015 to all ESTP's who are probably still going hard! I've been trying to set some goals and action planes for the new year and wanted some discussion in the area of goals and discipline. I know we all have a real natural ability to just accomplish a lot throughout the given year. Where I have struggled in the past is with discipline and consistency. I never have enough patience to see a goal all the way through because I'll try and shortcut something, or just get bored with it and find something else to do. So my two questions are:\n\nWhat do you guys do to stay consistent with your goals throughout the year?\n\nWhat kind of goals do other ESTP's have this year?
2	I'm an ESFP... looks like this sub is even more dead than ours.\n\nMy goals are always in the back of my mind and I'm always working toward them, I don't wait to start them on New Year's, so that is what helps me stay consistent.
3	ESTP here. Something I've realized about myself is I love organizing everything- my room, when clean is extremely spacey and efficient because I found the right place for everything- it sounds OCD but it's something I do naturally when I take everything in. \n\nWhat I'm trying to get at, is that when I have a passionate goal in mind, it helps to think about it for a second, and figure out the direction I plan on taking with it. Then, I break it down into different steps to make sure it gets done on a timeframe. \n\nNaturally, I still struggle with sticking with my direction without getting bored. But, I've started using a calendar app, and connected it with my phone. It sends reminders on when I get things done, and I put a little note reminding me it's relevant importance to my goal. The motivation I get isn't as natural and effective as if I chose to do it on my own, but it gives me a fun sense of action because I've already planned it into my head.\n\nI know it's wordy but, I hope my perspective helps. Keep it easy
3	Accepting responsibility. Do you guys find it hard to put yourselves at fault to something, especially if it involves the injury of another?	I have noticed somthing about me that I am not sure why it is there. Here is an example of this that has happened many times. \n\nI'm playing basketball with a few friends. It's all well and good, but I accidentally run into somebody smaller than me when focused on the ball. Not purposefully or remotely aggressively, but it happens. Anyway, they fall down and are holding the part of their body that hurts. You feel bad about knocking them down and for some reason you act as though a part of your body hurts, too. If you both fall down, you might grip your knee and moan, but act as though you can tough it out and get up. I don't know if I do this to avoid people getting mad/putting blame on me. \n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, if you fall down while walking or something stupid, you get up as soon as possible and try your best not to look hurt for fear of getting embarrassed. \n\nAs long as I'm talking about these two traits of mine, I might as well mention that I get incredibly irritated by people who I can see through. When one puts on a facade or something that others fall for, I get really mad at them. It is so easy for me to see through people and see their motives for doing stuff. \n\nPossibly due to this general understanding of people on aomethinf deeper level, i can give really good relationship advice to my friend when he like a girl. I can tell him what to say, I can point out things that go way over his head, and I can make conclutions about the other party very easily. \n\nI find that I am very socially skilled and am able to make witty responses fairly quickly and am generally a funny guy. I think highly of myself, too. \n\nAnyways, sorry for the rant and stuff but what do you guys think? Can you guys relate?
4	If I am at fault, I will put my hands up and admit it (and apologise). I've never been at fault as far as injury.
8	Have any of you ESTP's been in a relationship with a depressed person?	I am curious to know if any of you have been in a relationship with a depressed person and how you have dealt with it. What do you do to make them feel better? How do you not let their depression effect you?
7	People who are depressed can't be pushed pulled or guided out of it. As an estp who has suffered from depression.. (i ended up very alone due to me being an ass hole when i was younger... and stuff happened and now i am better off. End of story.).. just be honest. \n\n"I don't get why you are down... i just know you are down... i don't know how to help you, or if you want help.. but i care about you...  if you ever want to visit a doctor about this, i will go with you... or whatever you need... ask. I will do my best."\n\nMean while make her laugh, figure out if you are dealing with an introverted or extroverted person... allow this person what they need to recharge. Dont burden them by expecting them to help you recharge if they are introverted.\n\nJust be there... this is one of those moments thst can be hard for our type because it requires you to do... nothing. Just listen.. don't fix or move mountains.. just be still for them.
3	I may not be in a relationship with someone who is depressed but I'm engaged to a woman who has moderate anxiety. It's not crippling and she doesn't really have any major episodes or anxiety attacks but it can be difficult for her at times. I guess I would just say be open and mindful of other people. I know everyone thinks ESTP's are ultra selfish and can't empathize with others but I don't find that to be the case for me.\n\nWhile I may not understand because I don't have anxiety it's still possible for me to put myself in her shoes and help her through tough times. 
1	I've been teetering between ENFP/ESTP so I guess this applies to me. I had an ENFP partner sometime last year, their emotions were very volatile hence the sudden highs and lows and in a way I suppose they were depressed but wouldn't want to hear it from anyone. I think the way to make any depressed person better is to ensure they know you're there for them emotionally and that you love and care for them (but ensure they don't take advantage of that factor). Allow them to see you as part of their foundation but not their entire foundation. I think the latter can be answered by reminding yourself but you're a person too as much as they are and there's honestly a limit to what you can do or how you can help.
-4	I never really have. I find depressed people annoying. I've always been confident and self assured, and never afraid of anything (except spiders, of course) So I get easily frustrated when a depressed person doesn't even try to help themselves. Some can't help it, and they need professional help, but most could at least try.
4	Enneagram Types	What are some of the Enneagram types of ESTPs including for those of you who utilize this sub-reddit? I am interested in knowing. \n\n* Also include how you believe it incorporates itself into your entire character as a whole or anybody close to you that you believe to be one. Mention hobbies, presentation, perspectives, and etc. 
2	I have an ESTP 9w1 friend. He enjoys video games, inviting friends over to play board games, watching movies, playing guitar (with others), electronics, guitar pedals, and never wears shoes.
1	[deleted]
5	ESTP's what is your experience with INFJ's?	
5	my wife is one and everyday I smash my face into the dashboard of my car and scream "why hast thou forsaken me, lord?!"
6	INFJS ARE THE WORST\n\njk i love them to death, we're surprisingly alike for "opposites".  we get along best in conversation though...when it comes to getting out and doing stuff, our differences are much more evident.  overall though i'd definitely recommend them, 9/10 you go INFJs (minus one point for being so rare) \n\nsource: having an INFJ mom and an INFJ best friend
3	My younger sister is an infj and my ex gf turned best friend is an infj.\n\nThey suck at accepting when they are wrong. They suck at apologizing in general and they cry when you get truely mad enough to call them on thier shit and tell them to knock it off. They can be mistaken for extroverts because they have a bright shiny quality about them that draws people... but they really NEED  alone time to recharge. They will get you when no one else seems to... that means they can call you on you bs too... \n\nYou will war and you will love with each other... \n\nYou will want to protect them and shake sense into them all at the same time... that feeling from what I understand is mutal. \n\nI have been pretty luck to know these girls. Though I have hated and loved them both. Its a frustrating and fun experience.
3	OMG.\n\nI Need an INFJ in my life at all times. \n\nThey're masterminds that can use my situation awareness effortlessly into a mutually beneficial experience. \n\nI have 3 INFJ's I truely trust. All three are top tier friends haha.\n\nThey're the brains behind our plans, While I'm more of the face in a way. We work too good together, I pick up on their hints and act accordingly. We work the crowd really well. I can't even count how many friends, and sales we've made. The night usually ends really well with us. They're great entrepreneurial partners as well. 
8	How do you people feel about video games?	Just wondering if ESTP type people get crazy obsessed with video games? I know you're all about adventure and shit, but do people always prefer going out and scaling mountains and jumping off cliffs and stuff, or do you like fantasy adventures like being Link in the Legend of Zelda or being some crazy villain Rogue ganker in World of Warcraft?\n\nI'd like a little more insight into ESTPs! Do you spend a lot of time on the internet, or do you prefer to be out in the real world doing whatever it is that you wanna do?\n\nThank you!!
2	Used to be quite into them. Never obsessed. Don't remember the last time I played a video game. 3+ years ago.\nI prefer going and doing something. On my death bed I won't look and think "oh remember that night I got a 25 person kill streak?"\nOn my death bed I'm going to look back on my life and think "remember that night we went for a walk for no reason at all and we ended up on a boat to Ireland?
4	I prefer to be out and about travelling, but as a student I get stuck at home on the computer a lot. I used to play WoW for a bit but got kind of tired of how long it was :P I do like quest based games but now I just stick to shorter ones with good stories. Also my SO is really into gaming so I'll play Xbox things with him once in a while 
3	I absolutely love vidya. I have gotten very addicted to some games (like the 800 hours I spent on Skyrim). I am however very prone on quitting MMOs because they required too much devotion from me. One-match type of games with friends are the best: COD:Zombies, Dota2, Little Big Planet, Civilization, Racing. But I do also like Adventure actiongames like Skyrim, Crysis, Infamous, GTA and Assassins Creed (i played all of which up until Unity).
2	[deleted]
2	I play like 4-5 times in a month. Mostly because I just don't have time for this, there are work and other fun things to do. But if I play, I take whole day off and play like 12 hours straight. I prefer shorter games not endless MMOs. \n\n\nThough I play AAA games like GTA, Portal, Farcry etc, I love to find new kind of puzzle games which tend to be flash/html5 games. I really want to play teamwork games like MOBA, but they have too long learning curve.\n\n\nMy favorite game is still AoE2, although I don't play it often.\n\n\n\nI spend most of my free time outside in summer, but I need internet too.
1	i have been playing dota / dota 2 on and off for about 10+ years now. all the other games just dont have that allure that dota does.\n\neach match is different. games are always different. so many permutations. manages to catch my interest
13	Anyone else just plain awful at all art?	I've failed every art class I've taken because I "didn't try hard enough". But really I just can't draw or sculpt for my life. Here's my best dog drawing lol:http://i.imgur.com/7dDEGyB.jpg. ironically I like analyzing art/music etc... I just can't make it
2	I'm an ISFP. I find this super interesting, as I would say that art is a talent of mine, yet I am in the same category (SP) as ESTPs. If I had to guess, I would say that my introverted nature helps me notice finer details. Also, it could be the feeling vs. thinking aspect that affects it. I'm not really sure, what do you think?
1	Nope, I am noy great but I am pretty good. 
1	I really like sculpting although my skill is questionable, and I also enjoy digital design stuff but I find I'm good with turning people's ideas/familiar things into art but terrible at creating my own pieces
1	Thought this was relevant: http://www.chron.com/life/article/Which-of-George-W-Bush-s-paintings-is-your-5885691.php#photo-4364387. George W is apparently an ESTP and his dog paintings put mine to shame
1	i'm alright.  my ESTP stepdad is actually really good at art, both painting and drawing.   
3	ESTP bad memory?	Do any of you guys suffer from a terrible memory? I have a really hard time remembering things from a week ago. There will be events from a few months back that friends will tell me what I did like I wasn't even there. It's almost like 50 first dates all over again :/
3	I have an awful memory! Passing exams isn't too bad, given enough time I can force myself to memorise just enough info. HOWEVER my partner says something, I'm genuinely interested and I've forgotten later that day.
2	My memory isn't nearly as bad as yours but I don't have the best memory ever. Sometimes it's like I'm watching my memories in blurry cable as opposed to HD. I still remember everything that happens it just isn't so clear. 
2	I have a fairly bad memory... i can hardly remember half of my life. 
1	Sounds just like me. The only things I remember (extremely vividly) are major life events, my mushroom trip O-:), and details about girls that I'm interested in when I first meet them. Other than that, I think we're masters of traversing through life/conversations and have a natural script for everything so most things don't stick out... (If we're all as similar as I think we are)
1	I'm ENTP and my memory is deplorable...Maybe its a ExTP thing since we take in sooooo much information at such a high speed we only compartmentalize what is actually vital
14	ESTP's seem to get a bad rep	My experience as an ESTP seems to differ from most I've seen on internet posts. My understanding is we're incredibly virtuous, and nice at heart, we don't turn rage outwards. We have two extremes when stress gets to us- letting our extrovert side take over, resulting in us being arrogant and overwhelmingly friendly; and, when our introvert side takes over, and results in us closing up, no eye contact, and loss of motivation. Does this sound like other people? I know extraversion/introversion can differ among those- but I think I'm split down the middle-leaning more towards extroversion. And, I think having those swings, and both makes me incredibly hard to read. But, overall I think we're some of the nicest people out there, just really misunderstood.
8	I think I am a very good willed person, I probably wouldn't ever be considered overly nice but I definitely don't intentionally hurt people. \n\nI don't really understand the hate we get from the MBTI community. I feel as though they think we're all Derrick Zoolander or something but in reality every ESTP I've ever met has been fairly intelligent. I feel as though I kind of have to be because I want to have a base knowledge about every topic so that I can create conversation with as many people as possible. And that's my particular ice breaker, I find something they enjoy and then I speak about it just enough to peak their interest.\n\nIt has resulted in me knowing a bit about almost everything.  
6	I feel the exact way. I'm a nice person dammit! Haha.. but those drastic swings really are brutal. \n\nPeople remember how others make them feel, and the tertiary Fe is often seen through uncontrolled anger rather than our attempts to be compassionate. It is hard to maintain a consistent Fe when Se is bouncing around everywhere.
2	I'm one letter off (F) but I relate. I can get either very dictatorial when mad, or just shut off completely. But most of the time I'm a very nice person, and it's rare anyone sees those sides of me.
2	I think ESTPs definitely get a bad rep. Their humor is so blunt and dumb that people underestimate their intellectual ability. But whenever I've gotten close to an ESTP, I'm always amazed by his Ti. It's like "woah, where'd that analyzation come from?" \n\nI don't know if I'd call ESTPs especially nice though. I think y'all can be just as ASPD as us ENTPs.
1	Completely agree. The introversion side has made it hard for me in relationships especially.
1	Yup
1	INTP's perspective: I had an ESTP friend who had endless hilarious jokes and vivacious energy. I basically just sat there and let her and my other friend chat. I liked to observe their reactions. It was much more entertaining than listening to the teacher go over poetry meter rules YET AGAIN in English. I liked having the privilege of laughing along with them without having to contribute many words to the conversation. That was a pretty ideal social interaction. 
1	I completely agree. I feel that sooooo many 'NT' types look down on us for not being smart... I read this little saying that said, " 'NT's' I see you smirking at me like you think I don't know anything"... I feel like most don't get us and try to write us off as the wild animals who have no control whatsoever. However, ESTP's are quite smart and can be very manipulative... alot of my friends underestimate me and are surprised when I come out on top (though I kind of love the challenge of those underestimating me). However, I think what also contributes to the bad rep is we can be a bit hard to understand and know. I love when I find other ESTP's, especially with developed Ti... I feel, safe (if that's the right word) to share my thoughts; cause they, for the most part, understand to a good degree.
1	I like you guys.\n\nYou seem like crazy bastards. 
0	[I should preface this by disclosing my ENTP-ness] \n\nESTPs get a bad rep in life as well. You stupid fucks are polarizing people (but very charismatic). \n\nI've had great (and highly illegal) times w/ ESTPs, but I'll be damned if you guys don't project cheesy amounts of bravado/ego.  \n\nLess patient personality types write you off almost immediately, because you don't come off as genuine. \n\nPersonally, I usually vibe with ESTPs. I just find it hard to keep your attention long enough to have a really enjoyable, sustained conversation.
2	Any ESTP's met other ESTP's in person?	What was that like?
2	My father, we tend to get into arguments because we are fairly stubborn
2	I've got a pretty good friend from college who's also one and we pretty much can't stop talking for hours on end whenever the two of us get together.
1	Yes. Sexy
1	I covet the other ESTPs in my life because I think they're fun and clever. Nobody is as resourceful, and as an ESTP myself I find it really easy to see where a line of thinking is headed when I chat up another ESTP.\n\nI think I have three who *generally* fit the type in my life: my boyfriend, my longtime friend from Germany, and a graphic designer I know. I tend to spend long binges of time with these people, and we discuss hypothetical solutions to real and imaginary problems.\n\nWell actually I have a language barrier with the graphics guy, so we don't hit it off as well.
1	Not Sure, I'm still new to the whole thing. Sounds like it would be pretty cool to know others like me.
1	Oh its a scary. \n\nI try and avoid another me at all cost. \n\n\nI really like being the strongest personality in the room, other than my chosen infj mastermind I kinda attach to at the time.\n\nThey're just so good at using my talents for a mutually beneficial cause haha.\n\nBut with another ESTP in the room. It instantly becomes a pissing contest of who's better that can get very dangerous.\n
1	I tend to want to destroy them if they are ass holes/ hurting people... or have fun getting into troble with them Like instant best friends who dont exactly trust each other but will sort of play off of each other In the moment.\n\nEverything is cool while its fun... but if you fuck with my people i will destroy you... my little sister is and infj and my little bro is an infp... why they attract wolves like us... idk.\n\n
3	Made a writing prompt about personality types! How we'll do you know your type?	
3	ESTPs: Have you taken the StrengthsFinder/StrengthsQuest test?	I took the test recently and found that my results fell exactly in line with the qualities of ESTP. (No surprise, as I am an ESTP, but I know that some people's results didn't fall quite as exactly in line with their type.)\n\nMy strengths:\n1. Woo\n2. Activator\n3. Maximizer\n4. Communication\n5. Positivity\n\nHave any of you taken this test as well and gotten similar/different results?
4	Link?
1	I am an INTJ. My strengths are:\n\n1. Ideation\n\n2. Command\n\n3. Learner\n\n4. Context\n\n5. Intellection
1	Link that bad boy
6	What do ESTPs look like?	This sub doesn't have a picture thread yet! Post a picture of yourself and show us what ESTPs look like!
9	Whelp I guess someone has to get it started. [This is the most recent picture I have] (http://i.imgur.com/hIXsD2o.jpg). It was from last weekend before I hit up a club. \n\nDo other subs have this? If you could hit us up with a link I think it'd be cool to see!
4	Omg! I'm a little late to the party, but you're all so good-looking! I feel like I'd love to go clubbing with y'all already, or shoot the shit.\n\n[pic](http://i.imgur.com/rJs2UGB.jpg).
6	not a selfie and it's from a while back (my hair is red now) but [here you go](http://i.imgur.com/LqlEhlu.jpg) \n\nedit: whoa all the guys on this thread are handsome af.  but that's totally not surprising haha
7	[Here's me.](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-QChzYFJZoN0/VBi2C5j9OYI/AAAAAAAFSF8/yh-wmtc3gKo/w1153-h865-no/IMG_20140522_132227.jpg)
2	Thanks for the pictures everyone! I finished the album here: http://imgur.com/a/CGIFH/all
5	Attack on Titan (the best example of an ESTP I have ever seen)	I am the type of person who typically hates anime, but with how many people had recommended Attack on Titan to me I had to at least watch a few episodes.  The main character is an ESTP like me.  He can be rash and foolhardy sometimes, but more importantly he is the most badass and awesome character on the show.  I wasn't sure at first if the character fit, but the more I watched, it was like watching myself.  By the end of the first season I was flabbergasted with how alike we are.  That's all.
6	A lot of shounen main characters are ESTPs. Might want to look more into anime. Whatever you *think* 'anime' is, you are wrong. Even if you are an anime fan, you are still wrong :P. It's simply a medium. It's like saying "I am the type of person who typically hates movies". It's a broad statement that's probably not entirely true.\n\nI'd also recommend Full Metal Alchemist. It's a gateway drug anime, and I think you ESTPs would like it.
3	What are some of the most influential ESTP's?	I'm looking for a role model because my dad isn't a very good one and my mom is complete opposite of me. What are some of the most influential ESTP's?
1	Mine are David Lee Roth and [PK Subban.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSjoEpcVETY)
1	FDR, Winston Churchill, LBJ, Donald Trump... I'm sure there are more.
7	INTJ here asking for advice with ESTP brother	My brother has failed the majority of his classes so far and he doesn't seem to care about anything that doesn't involve drugs or video games. He's currently a sophomore in high school and the year just started. It's a fresh start and I really want him to take advantage of his time while he still can. He's smart as shit and is completely capable of doing well but he lacks the interest. Is there anything I can do to get him interested in school. I tell him constantly that I will help him with whatever he needs help with. He lives completely in the moment which isn't a bad thing, but it does become an issue when he starts to face criminal charges. I don't want him to end up like his dad; being fired from every job, always contemplating suicide.\n
2	Are you my brother? Probably not considering that I'm an only child and finished school 2 years ago. I'll be honest, I winged it to the end, and managed to get into the uni of my choice. There was literally nothing that could motivate me. Maybe if a person I disliked would say they are better than me, I would bust my ass to prove them wrong. It's just that most of the subjects were so pointless. I didn't fail any of my classes though cause my mother would kill me.\n\nNow that I'm in Uni I'm studying the subject of my choice so it's a lot better. So I think one of the things you guys can do is change his classes to things he wants to do (if the school allows that). About the arresting thing,  after it happens once, one gets A LOT more careful.
2	I slacked my way through university, failed a class but graduated on time. I had to find the thing that I always loved and turn it into a career that matched my skill set. Maybe you should casually drop some college (or I guess Americans call it community college?) brochures that have video game design programs, or something hands on that he may excel at. Another option may be to have his guidance councillor talk to him. Don't know if that is possible but I know for myself, I am more willing to act on criticism from strangers rather than family/friends. Also maybe being in some sort of school club/activity/sport that your parents don't ground him from can change his mind about taking a more active role in his own life. Having some sort of physical activity or sport really helps me get motivated in other parts of my life. \n\nI have to say though, if it weren't for my family pushing me to become something I probably would not have worked hard to get into university in the first place. If you're in uni or something you should bring up the interesting classes you can take and how different the experience is from high school. Give him a reason to want to get out of there, praise him for his achievements at school and keep bringing up how much it will benefit his life. \n\nEdited to add: some sort of competition or prize can really get me going. Being told I can't do something or won't be able to do something really grinds my gears and makes me want to prove them wrong. Not to say you have to bribe him either but maybe helping him reach some sort of goal means you guys can do an activity together? It would depend on your brother and what he likes but right now my motivation to reach a goal is getting a tattoo :P 
4	I am looking for tips to get along with my estp dad.	Hi, I am an enfp and my dad is an estp. We are polar opposites and we work together. So I am trying to figure out if there are any things I should look to do to male it easier. Thanks in advance.
8	xNFPs and xSTPs are known to run into problems.\n\nI don't have too much experience dealing with xSTPs myself, but I guess my advice would be to keep it light and humorous. Don't try and get into your personal values too much, and don't get too philosophical.\n\nKeep things fun and action oriented.
2	As an infp with an istj mother I know the feeling.  I think the only advice I can give you is just get on with it best you can.  You don't really give us much info as to what the two of you struggle to agree on.  But at the end of the day just because he's your father doesn't mean he's perfect, the two of you will probably never see completely eye to eye, as you are so different.  You just need to try to build the best possible bridges for you two to help each other as best as possible and accept that you won't always get along.
1	[deleted]
1	Hey! I'm and ENFP and I have an ESTP father too! I know how you feel. What I've found, is try not to talk deeply about things, because they won't really get it. The biggest problem is they never make a plan. While ENFPs don't always try to make a plan, we tend to do it when we need to. The same cannot be aid for ESTPs. Instead, try showing them the problem in the moment. As for your specific problems, I'm not really sure how to help. I guess you could try showing him how long it takes to do stuff on the computer on a day off or something, but I don't really know about the others. I don't know if you are religious, but if you are, I would pray about it. Good luck, I hope you and your father work things out. 
6	Shadow (INFJ) AMA	This sub is really inactive but what the hell... I'll answer your questions when they come, because you guys are cool as hell, be it now or a year from now.
4	Do you think America's massive expenditures on domestic and foreign intelligence is of any use considering it is only demonstrated after the fact of major tragedies, rather than shared with relevant parties?
3	How do I get you (INFJ) to trust me (ESTP)?
1	I would've asked some questions if i had been able to finish the description of what an INFJ is...
1	Since when are ESTPs and INFJs 'Shadows'?\n\nThey share all the same functions, and shadow functions are the ones you don't use.
2	** Short survey about ESTPs and handedness **	
3	Were you always ESTP?	About three or four years ago I found out what Myers-Briggs was, and I found on every test that I took that I was INTJ. A couple years pass, I get out of a bad relationship, I move out of the house with my mother and into a house with some friends, I start generally being more social, and I'm happier than I've ever been. Now every test I take says I'm ESTP, almost the opposite of what I was. I feel like myself now like I never did before.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience. Was I depressed before because I was an extrovert living an introvert lifestyle? Or did my personality just completely change?
4	I feel like it took me a while to realize that I actually was an extrovert, and as I took the tests more often and read up on ESTP's I realized that it makes so much more sense. I thought I was an introvert because of a slightly neglectful childhood (middle child problems) and being bullied so it's sort of been hard to step out of it but I'm really coming into who I am and who I want to be for the rest of my life now so it's kind of fun :)
1	Had the same change around puberty. I was extremely timid and introverted. Now I sign up for presentations cause it's relaxing work in comparison. 
1	I'm the opposite really, i was more of an ESTP as a child but i've been spending a lot of time alone and i look like a mix of INXX types. \n\nFrom my experience, it seems like you don't just switch types. I tend to use  functions based on the usefulness/context of the situation, but i'm not great at it haha. Our types are not solid and unchanging, we can use every function but we just prefer to use the ones that we feel the most comfortable with. \n\nI'm glad that you're happy and feel more comfortable with who you are now though :) I should take notes because i'm no where close haha
1	Do you remember what you were like as a child? That can be a give-away. I can relate a lot to your post because, when I first took the test about 5 years ago, I was convinced I was an INFJ, with very strong Ti. I was 19 and had just started college. My teen years had been hellishly oppressive (religious and emotionally unavailable parents) which meant I was not allowed to socialise. I was also put into an all girls school from the age of 12, which I hated (I get along so much better with guys- nearly all my current friends are male). I had been depressed years, my social skills had worn down to nothing and my life experience was years behind everyone else's. Only in the past year or so, I've come to realise that I'm at my best when I'm around people, and my natural style is cocky, loud and forever chasing new experiences. It took me a while to make up for lost time and get my confidence back (ESTPs learn by doing!), but now that I have, I know that introversion was not doing me any favours, and this is who I am.
1	In middle school I was an INTJ same as you, and I took it again freshmen year and I was ESTJ, but when I was a senior I was an ESTP. I guess it just took me a while to come into my own and be "me"\n
9	ESTP and other personality types	Good day fellow ESTP personalities! Being an ESTP and using my powers of observation I have noticed some things and wanted some feedback from other ESTPs. Question time....\n\n1) What personality type do you dislike the most? Why?\n\n2) I have noticed that ESTPs (And most other types for that matter...) dislike similar personality types. Its almost like there can only be one ESTP in the room at any moment or anger sets in really fast... Do you find that true?\n\n3) Most ESTPs are "systems" people because of our unique ability to work with parameters and variables in terms of people dynamics. That being said, most of these "systems" I see or work around are very hilarious to me as I see so much possible FAILURE everywhere and on many levels. This is quite defeating to me, how do you deal with seeing systematic errors and continue to stay driven?\n\n4) What are your guidelining principles in references to raising children?\n\n5) Lastly, do most kids just naturally like/gravitate towards you as an ESTP? I think there is something in our personality that draws an instant chemistry with kiddos 14 or younger in particular. Its quite uncanny how quickly strong bonds can be formed with all genders, ethnicities, and demographics of kids... \n\nThanks everybody! ESTPs crave information on an almost soulful level and this subreddit has a lot of potential! We are natural leaders given the right circumstances and while we can be irritating in some of our habits (Who isn't, in all honesty...), we are probably the most capable of the personality types in getting to our true self and happiness as long as we have people to interact with. That being said, the word "blunt" does not even come close to describing what we do to those same people we interact with in terms of communication. If there was an Achilles heel to our thinking or acting, that problem is probably what holds so many of us back from the truly great areas of life like higher learning, or religion, or careers, or whatever it is we each think needs to be fixed/conquered in that moment. Thanks again and I look forward to the responses!
4	1) Honestly, I'm not a big fan of ESTJs. Even though they are very similar in a lot of respects, I find they sometimes tend to be more close-minded and judgmental. I think I get frustrated because I see eye-to-eye with them on so many levels, but when particular issues arise (mostly social issues) they automatically shut down other ideas. Maybe other's have had similar experiences? ESTPs are good social adapters I think, so I find that a lot of my friends are all over the board-- ENFJs, INFPs, lots of NTs, etc.\n\n2) I honestly don't know any other ESTPs! \n\n3) Can't say I have a problem with this. While I do see failures in things, I'm more concerned with the final result than the errors themselves. Vague answer, but hope that makes sense!\n\n4) no kids\n\n5) I do find kids gravitate towards me but that is because they see my as a leader in a group of other adults. Also, as ESTPs, we're good at reading all kinds of people, including children. I can tell when a kid is getting bored so then I can change the subject we're talking about or start a new activity with them. I experienced this while working at a daycare.
3	1. INTXs that are stereotypically arrogant, elitist, and judgmental.\n\n2. Yes, for ESTPs, if any of them feel the need to out-alpha the other. Laid-back ESTPs can coexist, but once one starts exerting selfish manipulation (which the other ESTP will obviously recognize), the other ESTP will be irked.\n\n3. Luckily, I have been blessed with several leadership positions which have allowed me to change the systems that I see. When I can't, I try to use persuasion, otherwise the failures just irk me. I know EXACTLY what you mean on this point.\n\n4. No kids, but giving them enough freedom while developing discipline.\n\n5. Can't say for certain. 
1	1) INFPs\n2) No\n3)*scratches head*\n4) Im 22\n5) My 12 yo sister and her annoying friends are literally obsessed with me. I hung out with them ONCE and now every time their over i find them breathing down my neck.
1	1. I don't really know enough about the other types to know which one I do not like. Sorry\n\n2. This one is really interesting to me. I took the test for a business class at uni, and I was pretty good friends with my professors son, he was also my neighbor in the dorms. The class I took the test in was like the third or fourth class I took with this professor because we got along really well. Low and behold, when the test results came back I found out he and I were both estps. This was awesome because I got to really find out what exactly an estp meant, seeing as how he knew a lot about the topic.  Turns out I scored low, or towards the center, in "e" category. He explained, after looking at my test answers, that the larger the group, the more of an "I" I became. So after reading your question I realized I got along great with the only other estp I knew, but I also know he scored very highly on the "e". He also told me one of his colleagues, a professor I also had a couple classes with was and estp and I got along great with him, despite the fact that I always thought he was more of an introvert also. \n\n3. I too have troubles dealing with systematic errors and I think if you can help me figure out a way to deal with them I can get some of my drive back that I feel I have lost. \n\n4. Don't have any kids. \n\n5. This is hilarious. I always wondered why my friends kids always took an immediate liking to me. I always referred to it as "kid charm" but maybe it does have something to do with me being an estp. Furthermore, I have that same ability with dogs. I can like instantly connect with both kids and dogs. I am a good person and just thought kids/dogs could somehow just see the good in ones heart. \n\nHey you said being blunt can be a sort of Achilles heal for us and I somewhat agree with that but I'd like it of you cared to elaborate as it may help me be less blunt. 
2	Any other ESTPs in med school?	Only one in my class of 21. I'm wondering if this is a rare type in higher education?
2	I'm an anthropology/archaeology major and I am hating university right now :/ Done in 3 weeks though!! Serious respect for you doing med school!
7	Estps describe your perfect relationship!	How long would that shit last? What do you expect from your SO? 
3	I've recently entered a relationship with another ESTP.\n\nIt's amazing!!!! We both think we're awesome, and it's like we're always able to follow the line of thinking of the other. Sometimes we have trouble talking over each other, but we're both so nonchalant about it we're getting pretty good at giving each other dedicated story-telling time.\n\nI know ESTPs have a rep that they don't stay in relationships for very long, but I really can't see this fizzling out very soon; it's just so easy.
3	"Hey that looks like fun, let's do that shit"
0	Emotion has to be foremost. when I feel emotional I'm equipped to express myself.
2	The ESTP, Sawyer from LOST [xpost MBTI]	
2	What lessons have you learned from MBTI?	Just curious. What has MBTI taught you about yourself and others?\n\nWhat types do you find yourself most at odds with, and which do you find most relatable?\n\nAre you still a lone wolf punk that hates when people tell you what to do?
1	INFJS don't belong with me...
7	Parents are shutting me down	I'm suffocating. I'm forced to be home by four and am not allowed to go be social. I'm (17). Help me 
3	Is there a sport or a club you can join after school? Maybe if they think its for your academics they will be more willing? Is there a reason why they wont let you do anything?
2	You only have one more year of this.  stick it out and dont burn any bridges you may need later in life.  
4	How did you get through college?	I feel like this personality type is not a great one to have in the academic setting.
3	I didn't, I dropped out and joined the military instead. 
5	I didn't, I dropped out. I then went back to community college for a semester, dropped out again. Worked in food service for two years and then back to community college for two semesters where I am about to drop out a third time. I have no idea what I am doing with my life, I have a fair amount of debt, and sometimes I just don't want to deal with any of this shit anymore. 
4	I got through college by taking a practical software design course, instead of theoretical sciences. Along the way, I made friends to help get me through the times where I would feel bored, so in a way i was accountable. \n\nThen I went to university, struggled to make friends and attempted year one twice before I gave up. I just couldn't get past three months without being unbelievably bored. Went into work and I've been there ever since.\n\nI have a decent life and wouldn't change anything, it was a great learning experience and it was only after I quit university did I take the personality test and discover I was an estp. Everything made sense after that, and it's helped me make good decisions about life situations. \n\nThere's no such thing as a wrong choice, take the positive out of everything and learn from it!

3	I'm fighting through my last year of uni right now, 7 weeks left- the home stretch! It's really hard to stay focused and get my assignments done but if I do a little bit of one thing every day its less overwhelming when I am trying to finish the night before. I'm going to college in the fall after this (in Canada its more practical work than university) so I'm really excited to actually get to DO things. I can't say I really remember much of the details in my classes but I love my subject and it's opened me up to a whole new way of thinking. 
2	I dropped out of college when I did this test and was an ESTP, but I knew I didn't want to be in college even before I went. I took time off (7 years) and now have been back for a year and half, but re-did the test and now get ENTJ every time. \n\nSo, according to the test my primary "extroverted sensing" changed into "extroverted thinking" and the sensing went to a tertiary. \n\nWhat does that mean? I don't know, probably nothing for sure. I think it means I joined the military and learned that college is worth it after I was getting paid to do a job I hated fighting in a war with a lost cause. At least, as long as you believe you're pursuing something in college worthwhile, I believe it increases likelihood of passing by a large margin. I needed to challenge myself/prove my own worth, so I'm pursuing an engineering degree. \n\nI think the estp in me learned about the world enough to know that I, an average white guy from an average middle class family, needed to focus my energy on something sustainable and fluid enough to keep my interest. How exactly does all this technology work? Well, might as well find out and enjoy solving problems and learning about the laws of the universe that only a very small percentage of the human race has ever understood and applied to bettering the world.  
2	Computer programming is the only thing I was ever able to focus on. Every single other class, it was a struggle to even CARE about the class
2	"If the ESTP has decided that something needs to be done, then their "do it and get on with it" attitude takes precendence over the rules."\n\nThis. I've always been a terrible student and an excellent learner. My parents were relentless in making sure I strove for good grades. When I began middle school, they told me I needed to come home with a 3.0, so I said screw the rules and did whatever it took to avoid punishment. I may not have been smart, but I certainly wasn't stupid either.\n\nMy biggest thing is turning in completed assignments, no matter how sloppy or blatantly half-assed they are. Bs and Cs beat a flat zero any day of the week. I remember writing five-page papers one hour before class in junior college, and have turned in plenty of assignments late. In almost all cases I've been shrewd enough to talk my way into no reduction. Hehehe\n\nWhile I was an undergraduate, I spent copious amounts of time ruminating on what made my peers better students than me. In the end, I can say I learned a staggering amount from them, but enjoy relaxing too much to work as hard as they do. We all received the same degree anyway ;)
1	Ha i dropped out too! I left college sophomore year due to a great business opportunity. It wasn't an easy decision, but one that i don't regret. I tend to feel very restricted in school settings, which led me to slack off and party too hard, and due to the nature of my sorority, my grades were slipping, my blood alcohol level was rising and i felt like i was heading nowhere fast. On a break back at home i met an employee of my father who's parents needed marketing help for their design company. Marketing is a natural ability for me, so after long deliberation i decided to leave school and join their company. Best decision i could have made. When that fomo starts creeping up every now and then i just tell myself that I had enough fun in high school and that all that alcohol that i would have consumed had i stayed would have only caused me wrinkles later in life. :)
2	What is your current occupation?	I just found this sub, and I'm interested to hear what m fellow ESTP's do. Also, how does your personality help/hurt you in your occupation\n\nI'm a intel analyst with he US Air Force. Howeer, I'm going to be changing jobs soon, to become an EOD (explosive ordnance disposal) technician. \n\nHow my personality helps/hurts. Well, it helps through my ability to act swiftly. However, it hurts more than it helps, as I do not get to see results very fast, nor do I really have to much control over my environment, because of a huge amount of rules and regulations, which is why I'm going to switch over to EOD.
6	Data Scientist\n\nIve been doing it a year or so now. C++/python, Statistics, Machine Learning. Its nice work but a bit lonely. I work in a team of 6 guys at a high tech startup. \n\nI'm in it as I look to become a CEO eventually, and am learning the skills in high growth industries. Did a relevant bachelors and masters degree.\n\nFirst 6 months were terribly lonely. But I've basically trained my mind to sit and focus throughout the day. Not anywhere near as social as I used to be though; looking to change that...
4	Starbucks barista... it's pretty sweet but I don't get as much respect or money as I'd like, makes sense because I'm in the service industry... still... I want more.\n\n\n\nI get to be a problem solver, an expert sales person who knows her product. I get to give out free drinks and samples from time to time... its like being a host at a never ending party where you have to cater to different needs for different people... so you must improvise. \n\n\n\nThing is I get bored and start BSing it... it causes problems. Over all its chill but I work with many extroverted people and compared to them I'm more quiet and observant or my surroundings.\n\n\nBut I get to be part of a team with a plan and we are bamfs. .. its just... sweet for a small job while I do school.\n\n
2	Carpenter/Handyman for work. Learning Java and LAMP independently while working on a computer science degree.
2	Reconsidering my occupation currently. Previously was a B2B sales for a fortune 1500, but found my territory manager too controlling and not allowing me to expand. Pursuing programming or accounting. Whatever speaks to me as I start taking classes here pretty soon. \n\nCurrently a barista, but find it lackluster, although it stimulates me. I find too many inefficiencies and my boss won't fix any of them or listen. His loss. 
2	Currently working as a civil engineer, still studying as a student. \n\nSome of the work can be repetative and tedious but in general the variety makes this a very exciting and enjoyable occupation.  I am a site engineer so get to interact with the hands on staff while still having situations that challenge me mentally and socially (interaction with unhappy clients and workers).\n\nThe other option my career offers is design or desk work which I think would drive me insane with boredom due to the lack of interactive and face to face contact and repetative nature of the work.
2	Late to the party.\n\nI work in High end fashiion. 
1	Bartender. In nursing school.

2	ESTPs are all busy having sex than being on this subreddit
5	Why is it this sub has ~100 readers and other mbti subs have close to 20x as many and is active?	
23	Because the ESTPs are too busy rock climbing to be here.
9	It might be a personality thing.
8	Hahaha, ESTP's are too busy getting stuff done!
4	Eh, ESTPs just aren't really the types for online social interaction it seems. I'm INTJ and of all my friends who are either not on fb at all, or who have profiles that they never use, I'd say like 95% of them are ESTP. And like 95% of the remaining 5% are SPs of some sort. They just don't seem to care overall.
6	busy having sex
2	An MBTI like-dislike survey!	
4	Is there anywhere we can see the results of the entries?
2	Lol I got bored about halfway through and went to play basketball. Classic.
7	Things ESTPs say/think	Saw this in r/ENTP thread and thought it might get some interesting responses here. What are some unique things you think ESTPs say/think?
12	My almost-guaranteed response to an iNtuitive type's hypothetical question: "It depends on the situation"
7	"Yeah dude, I got this"\n\n\n\nMost times we do... or we can recover if we dont... mostly. 
2	Here hold my beer.
2	ESTPs with kids?	How many of you have kids and how do you spend your time with them?\nI have a 17month old and we play constantly. We wrestle or play with a ball or chase him around.  My fiancee' is an NP and together we' cover the bases. 
5	is your 17 month old a dog? If it's a human kid, be careful wrestling him, especially if greco-roman style. Kids are fragile animals.
3	MBTI - as an ESTP how do you use MBTI to enrich your life?	
14	are all of you somewhat manipulative?	literally every estp i know is somewhat manipulative of people. just wondering if it is just kind of a coincidence or if it is general trend. 
12	I'd say I am. I became aware of it at a point because it was getting instinctive. I'd exaggerate or even plainly lie as a habit, due in part to my own wishes for acceptance among others. After doing it for so long it became fascinating to look at when and why I would do so. \n\nIts not really a case of being a lying, cheating wanker, just slight moments and techniques to make life a bit easier. In another time and place I could have been a decent lawyer, but now I'm a safety rep with decent negotiation skills. 
6	I would agree that I can be a bit manipulative. I feel like I know exactly how people are/feel from the first minutes i meet them, and sometimes use that to my advantage.
4	While I'd say that there are plenty of types capable of manipulation, I think that in some ways, manipulation may be "instinctive" or "easy" for ESTPs, especially given their constant situational awareness from their dominant Se function.\n\nThey say that ESTPs are great body language readers; in this sense, ESTPs can constantly be scanning their conversational partner for certain cues to take advantage of or work off of (it doesn't always have to be manipulative).\n\nI think ESFPs and ENFPs are also great examples of manipulators. These types share the dominant extroverted perceiving function (Se/Ne) and are thus constantly engaging their environment. It is my personal belief that the secondary Fi function (introverted feeling) can compel them to use their dominant function in crafty ways to get what they *want*. 
3	Definitely! When I first realized how good I was at it I was getting kind of scared, but I feel a little bit of pride in how well I can read people. I find myself doing it a lot to get out of people being disappointed/angry with me. 
2	I'm absolutely terrible about this. I don't realize that I'm doing it but the fact that I can't hide anything has almost conditioned my girlfriend to not ask me to do things I don't want to. She says the faces I make when she does make her feel like shit. I don't realize I make faces but it sounds like me so I believe her. That may sound amazing, but honestly it's something that I feel bad about because it is a way that I've basically trained someone, and that's not fucking cool. Also do other estp's also swear a lot? 
1	Very much so, got me out of a lot of trouble in college and promoted many times in various jobs. It's an incredibly useful skill I have developed.
7	What do you do?	Well I just found this sub today and man is it dead. \n\nWhat do you do for a living? \n\nI am a aspiring movie director. I am very good at assigning people to their best position, and am able to know what needs to be done. I see myself as a realist. \n\nWhat ESTP qualities help you in your career?
3	Welcome! I manage a team of engineers and do network designs for large service providers. I have no idea if the estp traits help or undermine my abilities though. I have noticed a lot of stps are engineers though.
3	I work for a group contracted by the BLM to help with field work (i.e. timber boundaries, river cross-sections, erosion control, and other related odd-jobs that pop up). I absolutely love it. I am always doing something and love going off into the woods and working.\n
3	Microcontroller programming and control engineering. I think I'm in the wrong field to use the ESTP traits ;-).
2	I decided to become a programmer professionally.\n\nThen they did MBTI training at work and I found out I am an ESTP.\n\nDammit.
1	I'm a undergrad (half done 4th year woo!) in Anthropology minoring in Archaeology. I want to go to college next year to do Museum Studies and hopefully become a curator. I feel like being an ESTP helps me understand people and also think critically which is a lot of fun. Kind of like detective work, figuring out why people act or think the way they do :P
1	Well, I'm a fulltime student first but my hobbies include DJing, playing percussion, and dance. In terms of studies, I love keeping up with politics. I also consider myself a realist. In leadership positions or when teaching others (part-time teacher), I pride myself on being able to explain things to others clearly. 
2	Survey: Where do ESTPs land on the empathy-psychopathy spectrum? Post your results. [x-post /r/mbti]	Please see the original thread, plus a guide on how to format your answers, here:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/1dao29/survey_where_do_different_mbti_types_land_on_the/c9oi6tw
7	ESTPs: How to date you?	jk I already figured it out I just want this subreddit to be more active :(\n\nI do have like a thousand questions for you guys though but in consideration of your built-in ADHD: What keeps you in a relationship? You know, the things that makes it worth sticking around for, keeps you interested, etc.
5	I get bored out of my mind when relationships turn stale\n\nI'm basically a big kid, and need to be constantly entertained haha
4	I date an ENFP. I think we balance each other. He understand people and I can learn from him.\nI like to date someone who can teach me new things, and that I can explain things too as well. My bf and I are always having discussions about all sorts of things, politics, science, pop culture, sociology, etc.\n\nBe patient if the ESTP you love starts to ramble, if you ask them how their day was expect details.\nInclude some detail if they ask you how your day was.\n\nIt makes me a little crazy my bf says "work was good" or "work was work - nothing happened." I on the other hand give a blow by blow of atleast 3 events that happened at work including but not limited to personality types of fellow employees, analysis, and what I learned from the situation. 
3	Keep us engaged. Don't just let us do our own thing. I like to cuddle with my SO, so that's good to do. We do enjoy physical contact, and we're very in the moment. We're not planners, its a step-as-we-go kinda thing.

3	How do you feel about ExxPs and why? Share your experiences with them. 	Just trying to get some conversation started with my fellow ESTPs! **What impressions do you get from other ExxPs and why?**\n\n**ESFP**: I jive with them well in social settings but can get impatient when they show a Feeling preference over what I assume is straightforward logic. I think it's mainly a difference between our Aux functions, my Ti picks up on their Fi and doesn't approve of how they arrive at their decisions. \n\n**ENFP**: Similar story. Fun to be around but I can tell when they're being manipulative, to me or to others. This rubs me the wrong way, probably because I'm capable of doing the same thing and don't like to see others doing it. Once again, their reliance on Fi can rub me the wrong way.\n\n**ENTP**: Compared to the other two I get along with ENTPs the best, probably because of our matching Ti functions. I can appreciate how rational and logical they are as well as how adaptable they are in different situations. 
3	Just found out one of my favorite people that I come into contact with on a regular basis is an ENTP.
3	Thoughts ^(feelings) of an INFP -Fi dom ALLLLLL the Feels fuck logic\n\nESTP-Se dom. The right hand of the ESTJ CEO and infinitely more likable than the CEO. The ISTP is the "cool kid" who says and does nothing at all but everyone credits with awesomeness. The ESTP actually backs up their perceived coolness with actions and words. Can manipulate people easily like you said.\n\nESFP- Se dom Range from annoying to ok. Always performing and seeking attention. Generally decent folks but definitely my most innocently despised type. By that I mean their behavior annoys me, but is not harmful usually (looking at you ESTJs and ISTJs; lets all rigidly follow your rules and systems over seen by people with 0 empathy and usually anger issues.) ESFPs supply copious amounts of trivial pleasant interaction which sucks my energy and desire to be around them. \n\nENFP- Ne dom. Rainbows, sunshine, and energy drinks. This type is just plain fun to be around. I get along super well with ENFPs because we use all the same functions. I gravitate towards Ns over Ss in general and I am much more entertained by our shared Ne than by Se (ESFP, ESTP). That said, I generally find ESTPs to be the more enjoyable Se user because of using fe. Any type that uses fe I usually get along with. Understand my barrage of fi damnit!\n\nENTP- Ne dom. Rarest type in my life at least. One word: Smarmy. Just google famous ENTPs smarmy smarmy smarmy. Smarmy and awesome! Take the quiet quips of the INTP and make it a full blown show and you get ENTPs. I like having discussions with ENTPs, INTPs, ENTJs, and somewhat INTJs because of their thinking dominance and the "logical" perspective. \n\nFinal thoughts: In order from most liked to least (in general of course it varies by individual) ENFP, ENTP ESTP (tie), ESFP

3	ESTP Personality Type | The Promoter	
21	You are not unique. Welcome to your life as an ESTP.	I speak to my people. The ESTP.\n\nI found myself compelled to write this post, given that the /r/INTJ subreddit has dozens of posts, and our personality type has none.\n\nNaturally, my conclusion on that is the following:\n\n"Well obviously INTJ's are going to be better at realizing that there are others with their personality traits, because thinking about these concepts is *one of their personality traits.*"\n\nLet's start getting to know each other with some personality traits that we supposedly share.\n\n[According to Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESTP), we are often considered:\n\n* Outgoing\n* Charming\n* Witty\n* Fun\n* Generous\n* Observant\n* Socially sophisticated\n* Resourceful\n* Troubleshooter\n* Unpredictable\n* Action oriented\n* Clever\n\nIf I could emphasize one that I identify the most with, it would be the final one: "Clever."\n\nOur Myers-Briggs description:\n\n>According to Myers-Briggs, ESTPs are hands-on learners who live in the moment, seeking the best in life, wanting to share it with their friends. The ESTP is open to situations, able to improvise to bring about desired results. They are active people who want to solve their problems rather than simply discuss them.\n\nOur Keirsey description:\n\n>According to Keirsey, ESTPs, or "Promoter Artisans", are the most adept among the types at influencing other people. Promoting is the art of maneuvering others to one's position. Concrete in speech and utilitarian in action, they are smooth operators. The ESTP knows everyone who matters and everything there is to do because they are very resourceful, always knowing where the fun and action is. They like to indulge themselves in the finer things in life and to bring other people with them. Their goal in life is to sell themselves and their ideas to others. Dramatic and debonair, they are gifted at earning others' confidence.\nAccording to Keirsey, based on observations of behavior, notable Promoters might include John F. Kennedy, Teddy Roosevelt, Madonna, and Donald Trump.\n\nEven more notable and something that I identified with as soon as I read it, was on the [Artisan temperament](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artisan_temperament) page:\n\n>Social roles: In romantic relationships, Artisans want a playmate, someone who can share in the pleasure and excitement they seek. As parents, Artisans are liberators, exposing their children to a wide variety of activities, encouraging them to push beyond their limits, and guiding them toward independence and self-sufficiency. In business and social situations, they are negotiators, making the most of the opportunities at hand.\n\nAnd finally from the same page:\n\n>Keirsey identified the following traits of the Artisan temperament:\n\n>* Concrete in communication (like Guardians)\n\n>Artisans are realistic. They want to experience events in the moment. They enjoy manipulating concrete objects, whether for practical or artistic purposes.\n\n>* Pragmatic in pursuing their goals (like Rationals)\n\n>Artisans take pride in bold and unconventional behaviour. They aren't interested in following a rule if they don't see how it serves a practical purpose.\n\n\n----------------------\n\nI am naturally disappointed to see that none of my fellow ESTP's have come across the thought, "Hey, other people could think like me." I would tend to sadly say (with some experience don't forget), that we are particularly self-centred people, who don't even begin to consider that we are not unique. We are better my friends, just not than each other.\n\n\nWith that being said, I think we are extremely valuable as partners, socially or romantically. If I ally myself with somebody I trust; I will go to the bitter end on it unless I perceive that trust to be lost. To other personality types who may be reading this and want to get onto an ESTP's good side, I would suggest the following (since I am speaking for myself, I will use "I" as a pronoun):\n\n* Let me speak as much I want to. Sure I'm good at explaining things, but let me explain a couple times if I have to, just to feel good about getting the message across in the most comprehensible way.\n\n* Speak to me verbally with with a little bit of warning. If you have an argument to pick with me and want me to be comfortable, do it in person or over voice-communication. I am better at explaining myself immediately with my voice, but then much more comprehensively with text (if I can get into the right head-space). I honestly think I'm just cocky with words; I perceive myself to be much more articulate than most other personality types, and this brings me confidence when dealing with conflict.\n\nI'm sure there are many more things I could say... but first you have to all find me. If you have a friend who you think could be an ESTP, please send them here!
5	Yeesh. I'm not an ESTP, but you deserve the knowledge that someone read this and appreciated it.
5	I'm an ESTP apparently. I really don't give a damn what I am and apparently a lot of other ESTP's don't seem to care either. \n\n

3	Oooh! Oh! Oh! Hey! Hai!!\n\nSo I'm not an ESTP, but my husband is.  And I know him very well. First of all, your communication style makes me think he might've written this except I know for a fact he does not go on reddit (there's too much and he's too add). Second, I am completely unsurprised that you would suddenly have the desire to post something about ESTP's to foster communication on a whim. Third, the fact that you were so incredibly thorough in the completion of your whim just furthers your ESTPness.  And lastly, I don't think many ESTPs care about this stuff because there isn't a direct use for the theories... Right now.  But if you would like to develop your third and fourth functions to become a more complete and wholly awesome ESTP, feel free to ask me any questions or whatnot because our functions are the same but in opposite order!  Your last is my first and vice versa.
2	What's up my fellow ESTP?!  Let's go put out a fire and then get depressed when we have to do an hour of paperwork afterward!
1	Great post!
1	I just did the test and when reading the description found it fit me perfectly. Hope to see other posts here about how awesome we are.\n
1	Nothing in ESTP - not surprising :-)
