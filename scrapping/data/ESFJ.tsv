4	Male ESFJs. You Guys Find Yourself Single for Long Periods of Time?	I haven't had a girlfriend in a year, but I also haven't been with a girl I really really liked in what feels like a hundred years (my INFP ex-it felt great to be with her; so cerebrally engaged, and adorable). Big sigh coming over me. \n\nI kind of feel like I have high expectations after a few run ins with non compatible chicks, and I have zero intentions on bringing them down.\n\nNo women has ever turned my eye or made my heart jump out my chest. I'm starting to wonder if there are long time single ESFJ males, and if so, how have you guys lived your lives?\n\nI mean we always have a hand if we need a hand if you know what I mean, but goddamn... casual flings are a possibility, but I don't feel confident in myself to do them-so I just toss that option out.\n\nAnyways, I'm into driving... extremely fast on the mountain passes. It's therapeutic in a sense. I wonder how you guys cope.
2	No comments yet, so I'll contribute best I can: \n\nMy ESFJ girlfriend also has extremely high standards. It's quite the confidence boost for me of course.\n\nShe did flings before meeting me in 2018, but at least according to her, they were only with the intention of a LTR. She would never do them with someone she wasn't interested in exploring something with. She spent about 7 months single.\n\n> but I don't feel confident in myself to do them\n\nIf you are an ESFJ, I think you have the charisma to easily do this.
1	Yeah, I'm not very compatible with a lot of women even if almost everyone likes me or is drawn to me. I've even been told that a lot of women consider me to be out of their league, which is ridiculous because I was the quiet, skinny loner with only a few friends in high school lol\n\nAlso, I was reading through your comments about your charisma and how you hate to over use it. I totally relate to that sentiment. I wish it I could be book smart, but I'm not, so I often rely on my charisma and manipulating people's emotions. Speaking of charisma, I really hope I can talk my way into qualifying for this one private university's admissions requirement on Wednesday
1	INFP female, 46 here...who has been co-habitating with ESFJ male, 46 for the last 17 months.  Can I tell you that for him to be single for a long-term (as in say, over 6 months) would probably be his undoing.  Before we got together, he was dating multiple women casually and hadn't been in an "intimate" relationship for about a year.  He's got VERY high standards (and I have posted to this group before that I always feel so humbled by that because he is very much into the "best of everything" which on some level I apparently represent).  The thing with my particular ESFJ SO is that he really doesn't know what to do with himself without an "other".  He will improvise as much as he can, but ultimately will give in to the nagging feeling of being disconnected and will try to fill that with a temporary person.  But, since he doesn't really \*do\* temporary, these supposed flings end up being drawn out and lasting much too long, resulting in feelings of frustration (with settling for what he doesn't really want) and delusion (maybe if he hangs on it will somehow, some way get better and magically become all he wants it to be). \n\nWhen I met him, this is exactly where he was-with a woman who was 20 years his junior and frustrated as hell because she was a lot of fun, but out of control most of the time.  Her lack of self-discipline and the fact that she was reckless and irresponsible were making him crazy.  He's a lot of fun and very adventurous, but he's also very conscientious and for lack of a better way to put it-dutiful.  He knows when to "power down" so to speak.  She did not.  He knew that she was never going to be able to harness the things he wanted her to without becoming miserable, so when he met me, I was refreshing in a way.  \n\nWe started dating in May, and by October he had convinced me to move in with him.  And we've been together almost 2 years now, and it's been tough in some ways (I'm nowhere near as rigid in some aspects as he is and sometimes that causes the occasional rift) but I will tell you, it's hands-down the most committed, delightful, respectful, understanding and solid relationship I've ever been in...and I've been married before!  He is a person who needs to have That One Person.  And that woman can't just be any woman...so I benefit from his dedication and his attention and affection.  He's pretty damn amazing.\n\nMy advice to you is this:  Don't settle.  (I don't think you intend to)  Don't question your ability to wait (you have amazing friends and family who can fill-in for you and want to see you happy and satisfied in your relationships-we love our ESFJ's...we want them to max out their happiness quotient) because you can wait for the person you're looking for.  Just be content to work on your inner life and polish the gem that you already are-ESFJ's can sometimes have rough edges...polish them til they sparkle.  She'll see you and she'll be completely unable to resist you.  (I know-mine had me from jump!  LOL)
1	Hm, I've been single for about 2.5 years now. Few reasons though:  my ex-wife cheated on me, so I'm going to be a little pickier this time around because of that (did have a temporary rebound flick after that); religions reasons--I don't date, a bit similar to arranged marriage or a traditional marriage of the old times, i.e. courting phase, engagement, then marriage, all within a year usually; I've really been focusing on personal growth during this time because now I have a better idea of what I did wrong in my marriage.  \n  \nCoping with single life hasn't really been that difficult for me, though. I've really enjoyed being able to connect with my friends again that I kind of put off while I was married. I get to focus more on my studies since I'm an undergrad student and attending graduate school this summer. I get to focus on my hobbies--I competed in powerlifting for the first time 2 years ago despite lifting for 12 years; also picked up photography. Also used my failed experiences to help my friends in relationships from making the same mistakes I made, which gave meaning to my pain.  \n  \nMarriage took up a huge proportion of my emotional energy and now that I am single, it means I get to spread that energy to other facets of my life. These other facets of my life make me feel fulfilled, so I think it makes being single easy. 
0	Out of 16 types, 8 are light and 8 are dark. ESFJs are one of the 8 light types:	
6	ESFJ breakup	First post so plz be patient!\n\nJust got out of a long term very serious relationship with an INTJ and having hard time coping/moving on/being happy. \n\nHow would other ESFJs handle situations like this? 
7	don't over-romanticise your ex and the relationship. it wasn't  as great as you're making it out to be in your head, otherwise you would still be together\n\nyou will find someone to bond with as well as the previous person if not, better. but DON'T RUSH because these things will take time. and time is a great healer, so hang out with your best friends and family and before you know it, you'll feel a lot more strong\n\nkeep yourself busy. don't go back to him/her. spend time with other people. and most of all, good luck!
2	I’m an ESFJ who has been dating an INTJ for 4 years. I almost broke up with him last weekend. Here to talk if you ever wanna just discuss their personality type and how they mesh with ours, and also can lend an ear as a friend too. Best of luck getting through this!
1	1 minute of silence.
1	I'm an ESFJ. I kill all my feelings. Find things that I like, and do those things. You keep yourself occupied because shit hits the fan the moment you think. \n\nHowever, if you do want to think, look at your life in a detached manner. Remove "you" from the situation and see what can be improved, how you can be improved, and what can be done next time to be in a better relationship.\n\nOtherwise, stay busy, or you'll start self-loathing.
0	Who broke up with who? In any relationship usually the one being broken up with feels worse because they feel powerless.\n\nI had a gf I wanted to break up with once, but when she tried breaking up with me first I was devastated. It was so weird. \n\nI'm INTJ so I can't help with your ESFJ question.
4	How can I get closer to an ESFJ?(my mom)	My mom is an ESFJ and she always says that I'm not close enough to her and she gets sad when I don't talk to her much( at least as much as my sister).\n\n\nAnyways I like her and I don't want her to think that I don't like to talk to her; but as an INTJ I really don't like the subjects they choose to talk about and I don't want to end everything with an argument...\n\nWhat should I do? How can I make her sure that I like her? What kind of subjects can I choose to talk?!\n\n
1	Why dont you start the conversation and talk about something that interests you? Im an intj and my wife is an esfj and we have no problem having conversations. Just tell her something interesting you learned recently, or something strange or funny that happened to you, etc. \n\nOr find a tv show that both of you like and watch it together. 
1	Well then you tell her that when you try to talk to her, she shuts you down and says ‘why is that important to know?’
1	I feel bad for spinning it this way, but based on your response to Miyagi...\n\nI think your mom might want you to be what she ideally wants and you're not that. So because of that, she doesn't "feel" close to you. \n\nThat, or she wants you to share emotional shit. I am hoping it is the latter.
1	Find what she likes to do and do it alongside her. Card games? Board games? Working out? Watching old shows? Volunteering? Spring cleaning? Literally anything that she enjoys try to engage in that with her. She will feel loved that you are taking time to learn her interests, and slowly but surely that will grown into an emotional and respectful bond. \n\nAlso, ask her questions about life. Ask her what she was like growing up, or how she got through (insert whatever) when she was your age. It sounds like she loves you and wants you to be your best, this might encourage her that you are really trying to better yourself by seeking her advice
2	just wondering how ESFJs would respond to this	[u/throwaway3n1p](https://www.reddit.com/u/throwaway3n1p) and I are currently working on gathering answers for how thought processes work in different MBTI types. This is just out of curiosity, not an attempt to stalk you according to how you think of grave crimes. All replies are appreciated!\n\n If we count judgments of *moral obligation* out of the equation, \n\nQuestion 1: How is murder logically fine?\n\nQuestion 2: How is murder logically wrong?\n\nNOTE: Feel free to write down whatever thought you have, whether it is emotional or just plain retarded.
2	Question 1: I would say murder is logically fine if it is in self-defense or accidental. Such as if is was late at night and you accidentally hit someone with your car.\n\nQuestion 2: I would say murder is logically wrong if it is pre-determined or if it was a gruesome act. \n\nI don't know if that's what you're looking for, but that's all I got.
1	I’d have trouble thinking of murder as fine— I inherently think of murder as the amoral killing of someone... IE if a killing were in self defense, it wouldn’t be murder; and if a killing were a murder... I don’t think it could be moral.  I’m coming up with a blank when I try to think of a scenario where murder is logically fine. Maybe if murdering the one allows 10,000 to live? Or something.  The question is (borderline) oxymoronic to me— removing moral obligations from an inherently amoral act is sort of asking what ice feels like if you remove the water, sort of. \n\nMurder is logically wrong in that it is the most extreme possible form of forcing one’s will onto another separate, sovereign being. If someone forces you to attend some event you don’t want to go to— they are forcing their will on you for a couple hours. Killing someone is exerting your will over another person permanently— to the degree that they can’t even ever operate under their own volition again, it just ends their personhood/life. It takes their autonomy/self determination/freedom away permanently— but a million times more extreme than that. \n\nDoes that give you any helpful info?
1	personally speaking, i would have problems answering the question because there's no way murder is okay if moral obligations are discounted
1	1) Self-Defense, Accidental (but harboring that guilt would suck for anyone, and Vengence.\n\n2) When you or anyone weren't harmed in the first place. Essentially, the person must do wrong first for you to do wrong on that person. Yeah, the logic is off-ish, but the idea is that it ends with the person who started it-if that makes sense.
2	How does your Ne work?	ISFP gang\n\nAs the title said. How do you react to people stating their intentions and stuff like that. 
2	I like it
1	Do you not like it, OP? How does it appear to others? (-asking as an ENFP noticing people’s microexpressions lately, when I do this. Unsure of what it means) 
1	To your first:\nWit (sarcasm), finding ways to deliver a message, similies & metaphors, problem solving, thinking of possibilities, irrational romantic dreaming, etc.\n\nTo your second question:\nI try to determine their angle, and think of possibilities. I try to figure out what it can be and can't be. Then, I pretty much estimate where they're going with it-I'm usually wrong, but I'm usually right haha.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm a healthy ESFJ. I'm not one to eat others' dust because I was "happy-go lucky."
5	Young ESFJ would love to hear advice of older ESFJs	Title says it all. I am 23 and have changed so much in the last 4 years since living on my own. I’d like to hear how life has changed for you as you aged and what lessons you wish you learned earlier. Or just anything that you wish you knew younger. 
12	Probably the main thing I learned in my 20s as an ESFJ is that friendships can be quick and intense but they don't have to be forever. (As an ESFJ, i feel all friendships ought to be forever!) \n\nI've realised my strength is friendship, its like my super power, its natural to me and one of my strengths, but other people don't see friendship that way and can be quite defensive if you try to enter their circle, or some logical types just think 'I don't need another friend'\n\nWhen I was in my early 20s, when someone would reject my friendship I would be devastated, I'd really take it personally. But I've eventually realised, just take that friendship offer and move it onto the next person, if one person doesn't accept its not personal, they just don't need your friendship right now.\n\nI currently have 2 intense 'new' friendships in my life, 2 separate people in my life who've popped up in my life in the past year, they don't know each other and have never met, but they have both taken to calling me their best friend.\n\nWhich is lovely, I'm delighted! But after many years of 'best friends' popping up and then disappearing from my life, I realise now (and have come to terms with) that just because I think a friendship should last forever, most people don't, and more than likely, when my two new friends have moved through the difficult times in their lives, they'll message me less and less and move on.\n\nAnd I'm ok with that, because I'll meet more new and interesting people to make friends with and go through the same process all over again.\n\nI'm not sure any of this makes sense! My advice would be, to a younger ESFJ: just because you see the offer of friendship as something personal and long term, doesn't mean others do. And you'll hurt whilst you learn that, but also become wiser for it. 
1	when it comes to professional jobs, be prepared for how goal-orientated the world of work is\n\nyou'll get people who are ruthless and only care about putting people down in front of others to show how much of an aggressive worker they are. and sometimes, people don't take into consideration emotions when making decisions, but achieving whatever they need to achieve to get a a great grade from their manager or a promotion\n\nalso you can put in the most effort at work, always show up on time, do whatever your manager tells you to do and be nice to your colleagues. but that doesn't mean that you're the best worker. if anything, you're average. you need to go beyond your expectations and be extremely proactive while making the best (not nicest) decisions\n\nto ESFJs, this is brutal. my advice would be not to take it personally, especially if you're receiving feedback from your manager. don't think of it as feedback against your character, but things you can honestly do better and what you're capable of. and being an ESFJ, there's something unique that you'll be able to offer the team. there's a reason why you've been hired, so bring your own strengths and use them well :) \n\ni'm 26 so still fairly young, but in the last 2 years i felt that i've really started to grow up (which sounds weird but eh)
1	I'm 25.\n\nAlways aim to improve. If someone says you're shortsighted, ignore Fe and tap into Si Ti and Ne ASAP. Do not get confrontational, OR defensive. Think of times you were and find ways to improve your Ti.\n\nRead a lot of things that don't interest you to open your mind a little.\n\nAlso, whatever it is, just do it. You hate it, don't fuck about. Do it. If you hate accounting, but it's going to make you money so you can do your own thing, DO IT. Fuck how it feels. You're feelings will drag you down.\n\nYou can thank me later you lucky young bastard.
2	Survey on Flirting behaviors and personality	Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.\n\nHere is the link to the survey\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
6	if you're feeling down about life, or in a mini-crisis, this video will cheer you up :) it's my go to whenever i get worried about something in life	
4	Favorite thing about ESFJ?	ESFJs spend most their time telling others what they like about them. And don’t get to hear much themselves, that’s why they try to hard to be the perfect person for each individual. What’s your favorite thing about ESFJs?
6	We actually talked before, but to recap I (ENTP) dated an ESFJ for close to three years.\n\nThe things that I loved about her personality are...:\n\n* Projected the most positive and energetic natural energy of any person I ever met.\n* Gave a LOT of attention (also wanted a lot of attention and affirmation which I like doing.)\n* Very affectionate and sincere. She was overwhelmingly the most authentic person I have ever been involved with for almost all of the relationship.\n* The reactions she would have to the things I did for her were the absolute best. For example I would write her notes before I saw her, then I would hide them in her room or in her car and then there would be this little game she would have to play after I left where she would have to find it. Was always the cutest thing when she found it and read it. Secondly she would damn near cry tears of joy when I got her flowers. \n* When we went out on dates she would go above and beyond with making herself look really pretty. I'm talking the kind of pretty that radiates. From my perspective she always made an effort to capture a high class look when going out on dates (Akin to going to an opera or fancy restaurant. She absolutely nailed it.\n* When it came to work and school, she displayed the greatest dedication and work ethic of anyone I have ever met. When I first was getting involved with her this was something that I saw as a tremendous plus. The caveat on this point is she would tend to prioritize her entire day around either being in work, or cramming her schedule with school (She would work weeks ahead of everyone else in the courses and not be satisfied with anything but near perfection.) at the expense of maintaining her own mental well-being. It was sort of my influence on her to try and make sure she had time to do what she wanted to do. That was very difficult. That being said later on in life where ever she ends up she will be stellar at what she does and applies herself to.\n* Her sense of organization is naturally dead-opposite of mine. Throughout the relationship her influence on organization was bleeding through into how I lived. Definitely one thing that I sorely miss haha. \n* Her sense of planning, while meticulous and almost down to the minute, was also something that did translate. She made me have a greater emphasis about the near-term rather than my natural tendency to prioritize future circumstances over today's needs. There were times that it was a little overbearing (Like visiting her extended family on a schedule akin to a political excursion.) but it was a part of the package that was who she is.\n\nThere are a LOT more than these but maybe something I said some of you ESFJ's can relate to. 
2	i'm an ESFJ and i'm self-consciously trying hard not to base how i feel on the compliments (or lack of) that others give me. it's hard since i've naturally grown up judging myself on what other people say and do. and i need to be more confident in the way i carry myself
2	(INFP) -\n\nCan't say for sure, but I'm almost positive my coworker is this type. She gets shit done way faster than me and makes the most amazing cupcakes I've ever had. She brings cupcakes to work all the time and it makes everyone happy. She also always finds a way to be super positive and energetic, even though she has a lot of her plate with a day job and being a ministers wife/mom. Solidly warm person. Oh, she also has an appreciation for the aesthetic of her immediate surroundings that I envy. She set up a coffee bar and all kinds of pictures/motivational quotes are her desk on her first day and I was amazed.

7	seeing the red flags/becoming an emotional doormat	Hello my fellow ESFJ's. I've been on numerous breakup sites, toxic relationship sites etc. I just wanted a different perspective. As ESFJs we tend to form ourselves to be what people need/want us to be, to make them happy?\n\nI recently got out of a relationship which was so incredibly toxic. I ignored all the red flags (which is pretty normal I think) but the thing is, even after I got my heart broken, I idolized my ex. I still harbor love for my ex, and pain for the fact that my ex is so broken and that's why I was put through the things that happened in the relationship. Now, almost done with grief, I never even really hated my ex. I still don't. I don't secretly still love my ex or anything, but I still hope she's happy. I forgive her for the things I was put through because I KNOW I turned myself into an easily manipulated person because that's who my ex needed me to be. I went into the relationship with a backbone and while I was in it, turned into the helpless person my ex was obsessed with "saving".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess my question is, have you dealt with turning into a stranger during a relationship just to make your partner happy? How did you avoid this later on? And how did you move on? I feel like because I feel mostly sadness for my ex and her circumstances that made her the way she is, I would have stayed and helped her be the person she wanted to be by using me as an emotional doormat. I just never want to loose myself again, but at the same time, would do it all over again because my relationship with my ex was so special. 
2	I've had a very similar experience. At first, I was depressed about losing myself and scared that I'll repeat my mistakes. Recently, after spending time with friends who are patient and not judgemental, I've realized that all I can do for the future is to not make the same mistakes. I try my best not to rush head first into pleasing someone. However, I realized that I can still care about other without emotionally over committing myself. Best of luck on your journey through life :)
2	OP, I had to break this up into two different posts. I will follow this one up with another post with my quotations... but hopefully you will find something valuable based on my (ENTP) relationship with an ESFJ. Dated for close to three years so I like to think i know what I am talking about with chiming in here. Below are three comments where I chimed into other posts under r/ESFJ in the last few weeks which cover different points... Before I get started with directly quoting prior contributions I do want to add a couple of short points based on your post specifically. \n\n" I idolized my ex. I still harbor love for my ex, and pain for the fact that my ex is so broken and that's why I was put through the things that happened in the relationship."\n\n* I can only speak from experience on how I was dumped by my ex, who claimed the relationship was toxic. She stopped communicating with me and chose to bottle up issues instead of talking to me. We were long term so I would have greatly appreciated having a legitimate discussion rather than her not saying anything. Contrary to belief as an ENTP we are not only very capable of handling conflict but we are also relatively receptive. Had she actually worked on the relationship I would have done what I needed to do for the sake of the relationships integrity. \n\n" I forgive her for the things I was put through because I KNOW I turned myself into an easily manipulated person because that's who my ex needed me to be. I went into the relationship with a backbone and while I was in it, turned into the helpless person my ex was obsessed with "saving". "\n\n* I think this happens more than you realize. We will bend our own convictions (Did the same) in order to make somebody else happy. Later on we realize what we had done to ourselves. This is part of the healing process to my understanding. You should not be someones pet project. You should never be looking for that metaphorical white knight to save you. **If you take nothing else out of my novel of a comment. You are valuable and you have value as a person.** \n\n"  I would have stayed and helped her be the person she wanted to be by using me as an emotional doormat. I just never want to loose myself again, but at the same time, would do it all over again because my relationship with my ex was so special. "\n\n* You won't say it so I will. There is still regret in your heart about the relationship and you wish things happened much differently. Again this is normal. I am going to assume by how you wrote your post that you were the one who got dumped? Regardless you should never lose yourself in someone else. Remember that your needs are important and you are an individual who should make your own decisions independent of what other people want or believe. That doesn't matter if you're ENTP (easy for us) or if you are ESFJ (Harder to understand that concept naturally.)
2	OP, See my first post since I exceeded to 10,000 character limit haha!\n\n\-----------------\n\n**Comment #1 from:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/ESFJ/comments/aspi5b/clingy\_needy\_just\_miss\_people/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ESFJ/comments/aspi5b/clingy_needy_just_miss_people/)\n\n*"I (ENTP (close to being an INTP) dated an ESFJ and I will say a couple of important things about my analysis of her that may help some of you.*\n\n1. *From her behavior she put way too much emphasis on what other people believed she should do rather than her own agency. I could never get her to do what SHE wanted to do.*\n2. *She would become "friends" with anyone but could never see what I already know. Most people are not your friends because there is a difference between acting cordial, friendly, and actually being friends with you.*\n3. *She was ALWAYS very clingy toward me. I never saw this as a problem because I liked the attention she gave me. She had days where it was overwhelmingly clingy and the way I got through it was to simply gloss over the clingy periods as if it is like her having a bad day. A clingy day doesn't have the weight to change my relationship with her because I find something she did too clingy.*\n4. *SHE pushed me away from her life. Not because of her neediness. She had problems with her father and I firmly believe she took out her frustrations with her father on me when it finally reached a point she could no longer handle it. Also bonus points for replacing me with the gym trainer almost immediately, because "I don't know whether I want to be with you or explore the possibility with this guy.". was a lovely touch for the long term boyfriend who treated her very well to receive on his way out the door. Haha.*\n\n*Long story short not to label all ESFJ under one roof. But I believe there is a possibility that many ESFJ are far too emotionally driven to understand when they are not making the best of decisions. The strongest development any ESFJ can make in my opinion has to do with maintaining an emotional grounding when in more adverse scenarios. The second most important development point in my opinion related to ESFJ is a stronger sense of acting based on what YOU believe and what YOU want. Not based on outside influences and biases within your friends, family, co-workers, acquaintances, etc."*\n\n\------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comment #2 (A reply to another comment in the above post)**\n\n*" And my angle on it comes from someone who had nothing but love for an ESFJ whom I actually thought was pretty developed all things considered. Sadly since I am ENTP I can immediately see exactly what you realized with friendships. Not only could I not....get her to see reality, but since she is on the younger side of the spectrum, I learned how incredibly easy it is someone to maliciously influence an ESFJ. I have no doubt the "friends" I suggested she keep at an arms length were the ones she wanted to win approval of and they at least attempted to sabotage the relationship her and I had lol... The friends she had who were actually very good people who cared about her as well were of sorts, cast away as well.*\n\n*If nothing else the guy who replaced me immediately was the one who vultured the relationship and she bought into it for likely the same reason. New person whom she wanted to win the approval of.*\n\n*Sadly I think ESFJ are incredibly susceptible to being used and unlike some other types I am familiar with, I don't even believe they can understand that they are being used until way too late."*\n\n\------\n\n**Comment #3:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/ESFJ/comments/a6jlxs/how\_do\_i\_manage\_esfj\_subtle\_silent\_treatment/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ESFJ/comments/a6jlxs/how_do_i_manage_esfj_subtle_silent_treatment/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*" Very interesting take on this. My (23/m ENTP (borderline INTP) Ex girlfriend is ESFJ and rather than addressing the problems she was having in the relationship (almost 3 years in) she ended up dumping me, going the rebound route almost immediately and claimed I was making the relationship toxic (believe me I picked apart the whole relationship because I was taken aback by that statement and wanted to make sure that I was not subconsciously doing something wrong.). I have spent the last two months diving into human psychology, psychotherapy, attachment styles and anything else I could possibly find to get the answers I needed for closure at the least.*\n\n*Looking back she was capable of communicating but only up to a certain point. By the point the relationship ended it was long overdue for some kinds of discussions to work on the relationship and move it to the next step.*\n\n*It doesn't help that I could see right through her bubbly nature to see how hard she was trying to hide how her past was hurting her and I asked her to face it so she could get past it in time and be happy. (ENTP live and breath self improvement and INTP break shit down to a molecular level like its nothing.)*\n\n*Word on the street is she is acting a lot different now and not characteristic to who she is. Basically I'm betting on house money that she is trying to bury me and she will not be successful because she will not be able to replace how compatible we were at the end of the day (not looking at it with rose colored glasses btw). She will be hard pressed as an early 20's girl to find another guy who will be both long term and check off all the boxes I was doing.*\n\n*I think she is affected by her decision to end the relationship more than she leads on. I definitely think ESFJ cant handle personal development, conflict, or stressful situations at all. I remember having to talk my ex off of basically the edge of tears because of something that was almost mundane to me, but it was very important in her eyes."*
1	Oh, absolutely. I was like the amazing morphing girlfriend, turning into whatever a guy wanted.\n\nWhat helped: \n\nNot dating for a good long while. Spending a lot of time learning what -I- like to do.\n\nHaving good friends to keep me grounded -- like the kind who remind you that you hate being cold and your sudden desire to learn to ski may not be your own idea entirely, or that your newfound passion for cowboy boots is at odds with your sense of style since forever.\n\nSeeing a therapist to help keep me on the right track.\n\nWorking on loving myself and realizing that there are plenty of people who love me exactly the way I am. One of my girlfriends actually pointed that out once… That there are many people care for me very much, and just because none of them were (at the time) in a romantic way, did not mean I was unlovable or needed to change. \n\nLooking at other people who are single, particularly later in life, and realizing that many of them have a very happy, active, fulfilling lives, and that I don’t need to warp myself into someone else to be happy and fulfilled
4	Interested in me...or ESFJ's just like everyone?	Hi there! I'm quite smitten with an ESFJ. As you delightful extroverts tend to be, he's just nice and loves all people. \n\nHe is also humble, perhaps leaning to the point of density😆 So I have tried to be very intentional about making my feelings clear. He seems to be responding well, giving encouraging feedback. \n\nBut what's the difference between an ESFJ who's interested and one who's just being their normal, bubbly selves? Even if you do get interested, is it maybe just because the person put the idea in your head? Not because you independently admire them? \n\nThanks! 
8	I think that an ESFJ that likes someone will definitely ask him/her out or find opportunities to get to know you better and have alone time. If he shows up more often and asks questions about your family/friends/personal life and has long drawn out conversations - I would say there's a good chance he's interested.\n\nWhile I am a ESFJ girl, I like to be bubbly around people but I will always try to find an opportunity to be around the person I like... to make them a priority in a way. 
4	My ESFJ boyfriend was pretty straightforward about his feelings for me from the beginning. He makes friends with everyone, and is a bit flirty with everyone by nature. He was was more upfront with me though, saying his intentions, really showing a vulnerable side of himself. I feel like if you get talking and he opens up a bit it could be a good sign.
3	i'm an ESFJ and tbh, when talking to people i'm interested in then i'm very forward and upfront about it (even though in my head i think i'm playing it very cool and taking it slowly)\n\ni saw in one of your comments that he's passed a few opportunities to hang out together - which makes me think that he could like you but not in that way yet - and is very aware not to lead you on. then again, i'm very dense when people are attracted to me. \n\nthere's still time though, so i wouldn't give up yet!
2	ESFJ (gay woman) here, and I can only speak for myself. I hate conflict and I am pretty good at feigning ignorance when someone I’m not interested in is clearly into me. I’ll be nice and friendly but I’ll avoid one on one situations for sure if I think they want something to go down. At the same time, I’ll usually talk openly about crushes on other people, etc, to make it obvious I’m not on the same page. Men tend to mistake my friendliness for interest. Not saying this dude isn’t into you, I don’t know the situation at all, just giving the negative perspective. If I like someone I make a deliberate effort to be with them
1	Recently been dealing with a guy at work liking me and not taking a hint that I don’t want to go out with him. He asked me out once and because I’m nice I said yes and took my roommate in hopes it would be clear im not interested. Not sure if he got the idea but he’s backed off for sure. Also ESFJs gossip a lot so if this guy asked some of my co-workers he’d find out, maybe. Another thing is people are pretty darn loyal to the ESFJ even though they gossip with everyone so you’d have to find a person in your office who the ESFJ talks to that doesn’t realize it’s gossip they need to keep to themselves. For me if this guy asked the right person I’m sure they’d tell him without realizing it would hurt his feelings. 
6	Clingy? Needy? Just miss people?	Do you ever accidentally turn people off/push them away by your seeming neediness? I can't tell if I'm overwhelming my friend by constant texting. I really miss her and just want her to know I'm here and would love to listen/hangout/talk. I feel like my emotions can lead me to be too  clingy. Advice?
4	Yes, I'm an ESFJ and it's taken me many years to realise, not all people see friendship the same way I do; I used to be almost offended if someone didn't want to reciprocate the intense friendship I can offer.\n\nBut I've mellowed since I turned 30 a few years ago, and can see now that I was certainly intense and why it put people off.\n\nI think one thing I learned is, if somebody wants to be your friend, they just will be! It doesn't matter how much you text or see them, or don't - if someone wants you in their life, they make themselves available, and will accept you for the crazy intense friend that you are!\n\nMy advice would be try and distract yourself, if you think 'I want to text my friend' open up a game on your phone or something, and distract yourself for a few minutes. Or some other app. 
5	I (ENTP (close to being an INTP) dated an ESFJ and I will say a couple of important things about my analysis of her that may help some of you.\n\n1. From her behavior she put way too much emphasis on what other people believed she should do rather than her own agency. I could never get her to do what SHE wanted to do.\n2. She would become "friends" with anyone but could never see what I already know. Most people are not your friends because there is a difference between acting cordial, friendly, and actually being friends with you.\n3. She was ALWAYS very clingy toward me. I never saw this as a problem because I liked the attention she gave me. She had days where it was overwhelmingly clingy and the way I got through it was to simply gloss over the clingy periods as if it is like her having a bad day. A clingy day doesn't have the weight to change my relationship with her because I find something she did too clingy.\n4. SHE pushed me away from her life. Not because of her neediness. She had problems with her father and I firmly believe she took out her frustrations with her father on me when it finally reached a point she could no longer handle it. Also bonus points for replacing me with the gym trainer almost immediately, because "I don't know whether I want to be with you or explore the possibility with this guy.". was a lovely touch for the long term boyfriend who treated her very well to receive on his way out the door. Haha. \n\nLong story short not to label all ESFJ under one roof. But I believe there is a possibility that many ESFJ are far too emotionally driven to understand when they are not making the best of decisions. The strongest development any ESFJ can make in my opinion has to do with maintaining an emotional grounding when in more adverse scenarios. The second most important development point in my opinion related to ESFJ is a stronger sense of acting based on what YOU believe and what YOU want. Not based on outside influences and biases within your friends, family, co-workers, acquaintances, etc.

1	How do you deal with matching people?
2	Relationship with drugs and alcohol.	Curious about other ESFJs relationship with drugs and alcohol. 
2	Practically none. have about one drink per month or less, no drugs at all
2	I drink a glass of wine or two 0-4 times a month. I’ve never been drunk. I’ve never done drugs.
2	i like social drinking but avoid drinking alone or if there's no occasion 
1	I‘m 18 and I don’t drink nor do drugs\n\nEDIT: I forgot to add. It’s legal for people of my country to drink low-alc drinks (beer, ... etc) at the age of 16 and all the other beverages at 18.\n\nStill, no interest.
1	Never done drugs, have literally no interest. Drink mostly socially, unless I'm in the mood for a bath and a G&T/beer/wine at home. Never been drunk.
1	My (ENTP) ESFJ ex-girlfriend would best be described as a social drinker. I was told of stuff in her late teens that may alter my answer. However the past is not relevant to me and only what I personally knew. 
1	Never have tried any drugs. Waited till I was almost 21 to drink - only drink socially now.
2	How to get over breakups as an ESFJ	How do you all get over a breakup even if the relationship was not right and torture the entire time? I find myself having to make myself hate the person by thinking about the worst parts of them. But with a relationship it’s hard to do that because you’ll think about the good, even if it’s few. I loose so much sleep over thinking and thinking what could have been. 
7	It's so ESFJ of you to only remember the good things about your ex.  LOL...this is something you guys just naturally do.  I've talked to my ESFJ SO about how he coped after his marriage ended (long before I came along) and for him finding people he could confide in who gave him a different perspective on the relationship was really helpful to him.  He HAS TO talk things out-another ESFJ trait that is just innate.  It's how you guys tend to problem-solve.  \n\nHe first went to his pastor, and then when he came to the conclusion that maybe he was the issue, he went to counseling.  He didn't go for a long time, but he did go and it did help him to see that there were some things he contributed to the relationship that bogged it down and made it very hard for his ex-wife.  He also had amazing friends who finally felt that they were able to tell him the truth about his ex-wife and how mis-matched they were from the beginning.  And at that point, because he had prepared himself by doing some serious soul-searching he was able to hear these people  and accept the truth about his ex.  She wasn't a bad person, she just wasn't the type of person he needed to be with-they were so very, very different.  \n\nESFJ's need sounding boards, people whose opinions they trust and who know them well.  These friends have known him his whole life, and because he worked so hard to hold the relationship together for so many years, they rooted for him and the marriage.  When it ended, they weren't surprised and in some cases they were actually relieved because he had become so unhappy, even though he put on a good front about it.  \n\nInventory your people.  You know who your go-to, got-your-back-no-matter-what people are and just be candid with them.  Tell them you're having trouble reconciling the finality of all this and you want to know their take on it.  The insight these people have will help you tremendously.  Your people LOVE you, absolutely think the world of you because ESFJ's are inherently lovable, dear people.  I also recommend maybe 3-4 sessions with a good relationship therapist.  Let him or her dredge the depths with you.  They don't judge and they are fantastic listeners and as an ESFJ you will talk yourself to the conclusion you've been seeking.  And that therapist will cheer for you once you do because seeing you guys get your equilibrium back just strengthens everyone else around you.  You're our rock, and we hate seeing you flounder (and often times don't know how to help you feel better...)\n\nGood luck to you-you're going to be okay.  I promise!
2	I just broke up with my bf and I feel your pain and I'm sorry :( \n\nI have found that the best way to cope is not to dwell on his faults, but instead to think about why he and I didn't work well together. We are still great friends and I really care about and respect him, but for various reasons we would not make a good married couple. Try to focus on why you broke up and how both of you will be better off as friends. It will take time and maybe even some distance to really recover and detach emotionally. I hope you two can be good friends eventually and spur each other on to be better people! \n\nHugs and understanding ❤️
1	I’m not sure if this applies to other ESFJs but this video was my holy grail when I thought I was broken for good. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/k0GQSJrpVhM
16	Advice for my fellow ESFJs	
2	We cancelled a romantic trip this weekend because there was, "too many other things that need my attention right now".  Ah, an ESFJ man who needs to keep everyone happy.  At least I had the guts to tell him I was disappointed and though his logic was spot on (because yeah, we do have a lot of things we need to finish up and have some closure on, business-wise) I would like to be considered someone who needs his attention, too.  He agreed, and yet the trip was still cancelled.  Such is the life of living with an ESFJ man.
1	I tell myself this all the time. 
1	So I have a few questions	I have determined I am probably an ESFJ but I just want to check.\n\nAre esfj enneagram 1s common? 126 probably.\n\nAlso I peaked in to a thread and everyone seems to be a big reader of fiction on here. I find that I am actually much more interested in non-fiction. Is that not a common esfj thing?\n\nI am also fairly ambitious hopeing to work for my political party. Perhaps not being a person who runs for elections but some sort of person that works with others in either campaign or with a congressman. Is this rare for esfj or is this normal?\n\n\nI also read widely like stuff like word and trivia games and read widely to know a bunch of stuff, mostly if not entirely non-fiction. it may not be books but stuff like this on websites like this just researching stuff.\n\n\n\nThat’s all I have for now maybe I’ll come up with more.
1	I can only speak for myself and my observations. I read almost exclusively nonfiction. My enneagram type is 2w1 and my tritype is 2-6-1. ESFJs can be very ambitious. \nHere’s some information on enneagram and mbti correlations.\nhttp://www.goconscious.com/home/articles/tom-flautt.html\nhttps://personalityjunkie.com/07/myers-briggs-enneagram-mbti-types-correlations-relationship/
1	http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=LSE_subtypes\nhttp://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=ESE_subtypes\nMaybe the subtype descriptions will help? There are two for each type.
6	your biggest weakness?	I consider mine to be inflexibility and struggle with improvisation.  Has anyone been able to improve upon these traits? 
5	Yeah I'm shit at improvising. I've kinda learned to improve by "fake it till you make it" in the moment. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy biggest issue is that I depend on other people for my emotional well-being too much, and end up becoming a doormat.
5	I notice that if I have a problem involving the ESFJ they take it really personally and beat themselves up about it, even if they did nothing wrong.
2	probably the fact that i can't take criticism well (end up taking it personally and ruining my whole day + sleep), or that i have low self-esteem so i tend to blame myself for a lot of things that happen which are out of my control\n\ni'm actively aware of both of these weaknesses but it's so hard to snap your mind out of it when you get into the rut
1	Can you explain more? Flexibility in what way? And what do you mean improvisation. 
1	Yes, please expound more on what you mean. Give an example.
1	 Are you frustrated with circumstances in which you have to be flexible or improvise? Or are you avoiding them?
1	Inflexibility is a common SJ concern. We may have to expose ourselves to uncomfortable situations, in order to improve. \nI work as a substitute teacher, which requires a lot of flexibility and improvising.\nCan you involve yourself in hobbies that require improvitization? Personally, I play games with people that you have to think on your feet. One of them is called Snake Oil. You have to try to sell a ludacris invention to other players. There are also some Jackbox party games you play using cell phone and a console of some sort.\n\nSide note- some people may struggle with anxiety, which makes adapting to change and trying new things even more challenging.
1	haha im an intp\n\nthis is mildly amusing to me ;)\n\nand from my experience you have to make it before you can fake it (because to fake it and survive you have to know what the hell youre doing)\n\nmy biggest weakness is going along with traditions without questioning them, cant do it (wait, thats not a weakness. hmmmmmmmmmmm)
1	Being liked. \n\nA double edged sword if you will. It's stressful to try to make people like you-it's why I avoid all forms of people (oh wait, I have a sales job-fuck).
1	Look through my user history, please?	I don’t think I see fe in myself. But does someone efj here preferably want to look through my user history and tell me if they think I am one of you?\n\nThanks.\n\nAnd please please explain. I don’t think I have fe but I could be wrong.\n\nPeople say my posts don’t read like estj and I don’t seem like one.
1	We can chat to see if I can see any Fe in you (: 
1	Have you ever asked friends and family? They get to interact with you in person.
2	Take my MBTI Survey	[Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WMhQAkegNdJ-A3xJcFrW-nFWrr7GmA0hZas0JV9VNgo/edit#response=ACYDBNhQ0PU1TZRvnGkP7PGc90QBwl3lFCfIB3vZtgcv085JbaqmtEYnxBTSVuifSUBK2rE)
1	This survey is impossible, because people don’t know the descriptions of all of the personalities!
3	Opinions on Conservatism/Right-Wing Politics	I've seen a hypothesis that SJs, more than any other type, is prone to take conservative/right-wing views in various degrees of intensity more than any other political world view, and I want to test it out in the real world of ESFJs (i.e. all of you). What do all of you think about the usefulness/validity/desirability of any of the varieties of conservative thought out there?
5	i tend to hate right wing politics as it's very uncaring towards people. especially when it comes to issues like welfare, health care and attitudes towards minorities (women, racial minorities, LGBT)\n\nleft wing policies care about people who have hit rock bottom or faced injustices through no fault of their own. and ultimately that's what I value as an ESFJ
3	I think it's interesting being an ESFJ. The SJ stereotype is that we lean toward tradition and order, which is associated more with conservative politics. On the other hand, as an ESFJ, we're also really caring towards people, which I think falls more inline with liberal politics. Personally, I don't consider myself either one but find myself to be more balanced between the two. I primarily dislike far right and far left politics, though. I don't think extremes are good. It's very gray for me. I try to stay away from politics for the most part. 
3	I have heard we are more likely to be susceptible to media manipulation.  And I think I had that issue at the last election but with the left. So I could see it at older ages but all the young ESFJs seem to very liberal. I have learned a lot from the last election. 
1	Well... not exactly.\n\nESFJs, just like all SJs, base their decisions on their past experiences. If growing up most folks around me are conservative, then I will be too. If I feel rejected by most of the people around me, I'm going to end up trying to find a different route.
1	I'm a textbook ESFJ, and I'm very politically liberal. then again, so are my parents, so that may be part of the tradition thing for me! I have three generations of union workers in my family, so maybe being liberal IS my tradition....\n
10	Can an ESFJ learn to become more independent?	To ensure that I don't accidentally offend anyone, I am using "I" statements this entire time. So this isn't about all Esfj, but me and anyone else who can relate.\n\nI have trouble essentially being my own person. I have a tendency to focus on getting another person to like me, and molding myself into the "right" person. I have difficulty forming opinions and sticking to them. I also can have difficulty judging the merits of others.\n\nThe times I am the most independent is when, essentially, I am upset or feeling blue. At those points, I feel quite distant from the world around me, and I spend my time secretly judging others and deciding what's wrong with them.\n\nConstantly second guessing myself and feeling stuck making decisions is, quite frankly, exhausting. It also doesn't help that I don't have very reliable people around me to aid in this process.\n\nIs there anything in MBTI theory/our functions we should focus on to become a tad more self-reliant?
6	I'm an ESFJ and have the exact same issue - I rely on others so much for just everyday mundane actions, not just big decisions...\n\nI'm 34 this year and still struggle with it, but in the past 6 months I really feel like I've become stronger. I bought a flat, in an area I was unfamiliar with, and have slowly (I mean really slowly - still going!) started to realise I can do stuff on my own, when I want, and that my own company is lovely and I'm not selfish for it.\n\nAs an example, the area I moved to, I don't know anyone but visited as a child. I had the desire to go to a certain wildlife park and see how it was 20yrs later, as an adult.\nAnd for ages, I thought 'I will ask xyz if they want to come with me' and stuff like 'oh I'll suggest it as something to do when I see friend abc'...\n\nAnd then the revelation hit me, like a ton of bricks. Why don't I just get the bus and go... On my own!?!\n\nHonestly, sounds so stupid, but it genuinely blew my mind realising I could just take myself off, have a wander, do something that *I* wanted, and no one else needed to be involved.\n\nI had that revelation about 3 months ago and I've really blossomed, I know I don't have to rely on having someone with me all the time...\n\nBut don't get me wrong, I'm an ESFJ through and through, so if I can have adventures with a friend I always would prefer that!\n\nYou'll get better at it, I promise x
3	Get an INTP and learn the good from it and teach it your good side!\n\nPd: as an INTP myself don't think that he just doesn't like you. We just struggle to communicate it
3	You can reach your desired outcome of being independent through poor logic as well. Be careful how you get there. I know an ESFJ who reached a measure of independence from the hive so to speak by becoming jaded after being hurt and by assuming everything they did deserved reciprocity and that their self worth and level of love from others was correlated to how much others celebrated this friend of mine. \n\nTo get to the heart, you must first go through the head. You cannot feel for the things you don’t know. Spend sometime fleshing out a worldview involving an ethic to have something internal to compare to the external. This will help with judging the merit of others. It’s not perfect, but it helps.  
2	Yeah I think you can learn it. I’m one also and I understand everything your saying. Exactly me also. \n\nInteresting you said you can’t keep your own opinions. I’m kinda the opposite where I have strong ones and are very black and white about people if they don’t think the same thing as me. \n\nI absolutely mold myself though to be the right person, mirroring them in anyway I can. \n\nI get told all the time I can’t tell when someone is bad news. I think that has to do with my extreme love of people and wanting acceptance. \n\nWhat age are you? I’m interested. \n\nI’m 23 and have grown a little out of certain things. I’m finally getting closer to the I don’t give a fuck attitude and that helps a lot. \n\nAs an ESFJ the best thing you can do is surround yourself with people who really like you since we take so much self worth from others. And surround yourself with people who will tell you that and not leave you guessing. No closure is our WORST enemy!\n\nAfter sleeping around, luckily I don’t think I’m ugly so I get a self esteem boost from all the people on the apps telling me I’m handsome. Do I think I am? Eh, I don’t know. I never know what I look like to people and what they think of me. We’re really bad at that and always assume the worst. And when people say the best you think they’re lying. Actions speak loudest for us. \n\nThe 2nd guessing will go away with self esteem boost you get from the right people. \n\nOh learn how to fake it till you make it. ESFJs best friend. 
2	I struggle with this too! I am usually placid and agreeable because I want people to like me, and I tend to absorb other people’s energies very easily. This is nice in the short run because it’s sociable and you might have lots of friends, but after awhile you may feel depleted and lack an inner sense of independence. \n\nDeveloping my own voice has been important for creating healthy boundaries between myself and other people. Instead of mindlessly agreeing to everything, I now take careful stock of what is being said before I respond. I might listen to a friend’s opinion, and ask myself: “do I really agree with what is being said? Or am I just inclined to agree because I want approval? If I don’t agree, why don’t I agree?” This mental exercise has been helpful in developing my inner voice, because other people’s opinions are first put through an internal filter before I decide whether to accept or challenge them. 
2	Would you like a buddy? I struggle too and we can totally help each other!
2	I too, was going to ask your age. I think it comes with time. After people disappoint you and let you down, you start to get sick of taking their crap. It kind of happens on its own.
1	Look up to ENTJs and model your life after them. You can't be them, but you can at least see what they do and how they do. Apply what you learn from them. Just don't fall into the trap of mistaking your Fe for Te.
1	Well, to be honest, you just have to let that weakness inside you fade. It's like a crack addict itching for crack. The more you let those feelings go, the weaker they become. Nothing's overnight and the feeling may be strong, but if you want it, nothing's unattainable. You just have to be able to see farther than your eyes can, or just jump and hope you land the way you like.\n\nThink about it.
17	Love you ESFJs	You guys are the most caring, genuine, and loving types I've ever had the pleasure to get to know. Honestly, I have no idea where I'd be without my ESFJ best friend. One depressing text and the next day she's at my place with homemade chocolates!\nAnd fuck that stereotype about not being as smart or intuitive, when she's her best self she can be the most intelligent, and cautious person in the group and so, so hardworking. gods, you guys are so giving and yet so independent I can't help but admire that! Stay the same, the world needs more people like you💜\n-An INFJ\n
11	It’s always nice to hear something nice about yourself. ESFJs go around usually telling others how much they like other people but never hear it themselves, like ever. Make sure to tell your friend it’ll make her life, I’m serious. 
4	I feel like ESFJs are like flowers. If you give them a little TLC they will give back so much more in return. 
4	I follow this sub because you guys are such role models for me. So kind, caring, responsible, understanding and generally got your shit together. Truly admirable people. -INTP
2	Love you too INFJ!
2	So much love ❤️❤️
2	I've experienced both sides of the ESFJ coin, unfortunately. On the one hand, loving, caring, sensitive and sweet. On the other, manipulative, ostracising, condescending, controlling, jealous, and victim playing. I prefer to keep my distance. ~infp
3	What am I?	I've been obsessed with MBTI for quite awhile now. It's been really hard for me to type myself. I believe it's due to my family of STPs and INFPs. I also struggled with depression and anxiety for many years. I finally feel like my true self. I'm either an ENFJ or ESFJ. I've tested as ESFJ ENFJ INFJ ENFP INFP. I currently think I'm an ESFJ with good use of Ne. I posted on a thread intended for typing, but I didn't get any responses. I'll post a link. I know it's a little long :D Thank you!\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/am3vx2/february\_type\_me\_thread/efpbwby](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/am3vx2/february_type_me_thread/efpbwby)
1	I talked to several friends to get their perspective. I’ve decided I’m an ESFJ that uses intuition regularly. 
1	OK, there's a lot to unpack here and I don't think many of those questions are well designed. so I'll just focus on what I think is telltale.\n\n> What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses? I enjoy many types of learning styles. I prefer when a teacher starts at the beginning (like in math, explaining how a theorem was created). My least favorite types of classes are memorization. That is very stressful for me. \n\nMemorization should be a cinch for ESFJs as long as its deliberate. Si- is based on memory, parsing information, remembering obscure, interesting details and facts is one of our strengths, we remember a lot of things, and memorizing things with intent and consciousness is very easy for us. We're known to be information powerhouses only second to ISXJs. Memorizing boring facts is a chore but isn't generally difficult/stressful. What is generally stressful for ESFJs is material that are based on understanding that isn't either self evident or ultimately a practical mode of thought. So things like Physics, Organic Chemistry, lateral thinking, Mathematics tend to be more difficult to learn for ESFJs. But then again, when there is a chain of events linking things together, like you said "learning how a theorem was created." learning becomes a simpler endeavor. Doesn't sound like an ESFJ on this level of analysis. I think your description best describes an \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go? I strategize halfway, get bored with it, and then improvise. \n\nThis sounds very ESFJ, especially if half the time things tend to go bad if you rely on improvisation and there's no one else to help you out. As an ESFJ myself, I get over this sort of thing by forcing myself into a schedule and a plan because we have Ni-Trickster in the seventh Slot. Meaning we are completely blind as gauging a means for ourselves to get from point A to B. We even have a lot of trouble figuring out if point B is something worth  pursuing, If you ever had trouble figuring out what you want or how to get it. That's could be a marker of poor introverted intuition (Ni) meaning that that is a good marker for ESFJ-ness. We are notorious for this. \*By the way, you have to be exceptionally matured for your age or intelligent to use intuition regularly if you are indeed an ESFJ ( time practicing meditation/prayer/self-reflection  in isolation is  generally how ESFJs can develop intuition). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> • Do you need logical consistency in your life? Yes. \n\nObjective logical consistency or your own brand of systematic thinking based on a subjective value metric where you prioritize certain things that others may not immediately rational. Like, in your post you said you are religious, which is good. But, religion is not objectively logical. It makes sense to you, and everyone in the congregation, but to most people it might not, because religion is based on faith and not objective fact. Basically what I'm saying here is that are you logically consistent or are you just .....consistent. If its the latter, that's a point for ESFJ. (Part of maturing for an ESFJ getting over this hurdle.) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> • If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed? I am happy to be alone for 6-8 hours a day, but a full weekend would be maddening! I would probably become very lethargic.\n\n100% Extroverted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> • How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate? I’m very curious, hence the researching. I’m curious about how other cultures work and how other groups of people think and feel. I try to figure out the why behind behaviors, and what it means about societies as a whole. I’m also very curious about health and medical information. I think I tend to have one idea that must be executed. However, I research in a frenzied unfocused fashion.\n\nBad extroverted intuition and completely lost unconscious introverted intuition, sounds like ESFJ. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOK here's the easiest test for ESFJ: \n\n  \nWhen you think someone doesn't like you or isn't friendly do you consciously or unconsciously resent them for it? Also, do you care if people like you or not? And most importantly, when someone gives you props or encouragement, does it give you fuel and leave you elated and filled with pleasure and a desire to repeat whatever you did?
7	ESFJ mom, ENFP daughter relationship advice	Hey guys! So I'm an ENFP and recently I had my mom take the test too. turns out she is an ESFJ! \n\nUnfortunately I feel like our relationship is strained. She says she trusts me but she behaves like she doesn't and has therefore been very strict (even controlling) with me for most of my life. I have tried to talk about this whole thing with her but it I can't tell if she just doesn't want to or doesn't even think we HAVE a weird relationship. I think it's the first one because she used to say "I feel like I don't even know you" when I was in trouble as a teenager. But, obviously our mindsets/personality types are different, so I want your perspective before I just assume. \n\nWhat can I do? Do you think she doesn't wanna talk about it, or do you think it's more that she doesn't even notice it? \n\nps-I have gone to therapy but I have only gone in-depth abt our relationship during one session, so I'll likely do that too as soon as I can. But that won't be for another year and half, starting March. What can I do in the meantime? \n\nThank you so much, hope that was readable. 
1	My sister and mother have the same issues. My sister, ENFP, was very rebellious against the tradionalist rules my mom enforced. It led to her leaving and living on her own.\n\nI'll tell you this, know how your mom operates and just give her what she wants. Unless it's severely abusive, I doubt it'll actually end up affecting you. For example, let the fly buzz around your face, what's the harm? \n\nDon't forget, your mom, "thinks" she knows what's best for you. She's a sensor with a present minded way of viewing things and a future-worrying oriented way of foreseeing things. So maybe she just cares in her own illogical way.
1	ESFJ aren't great at NeTi, or understanding new perspectives. They will stick with what they know/experienced. \n\nYou've got to expose her to whatever you are in small doses. You don't want to be controlled, well, don't be. Just do it small doses, not slamming the door at once. Give explanation here and here and let it accumulate.\n\nOf course, whatever you're in therapy for (is it actually important?) will impact that.
5	Hey y'all!	I took a Myers-Briggs personality test today in a class of mine and I'm ESFJ! Y'all seem like really cool people so I thought I'd pop in and say hi.
6	Welcome!  We're not a super busy sub, but we care.  :)
3	Hi, it's friday night so all the other ESFJs are out. i'm tired so i'm home drinking wine with my dog. Welcome! :)
2	Ayyyyyyyyyy!
2	Welcome! I hope you get a lot out of the MBTI! It’s great for self growth (:
4	I’m INTP (literally your exact opposite), and I need help.	ESFJs are supposedly super social (correct me if i’m wrong), something i’ve never even dreamed of being. I dunno if it’s like a commitment issue or what but how do you build up confidence in social situations? I try to be more outgoing but I always end up backing away whenever I get any actual attention. I have friends, though, that’s not the issue, I just can’t talk for shit sometimes.
6	The trick is you have to fake it till you make it. Even if I feel nervous I sure as hell dont show it. I also take a lot of happiness from being the social one in a situation but it definitely depends on the group size. Sometimes if I drink a lot the next day I am super anti social and its like pulling teeth to talk so I understand what you mean for sure. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso other people can tell when your nervous and backing out of conversation and the right people will help you. ESFJs love getting the shy person to take and make them feel really comfortable in the group because I really value the intelligence of most introverts.
1	Definitely fake it till you make it. If you’re feeling super self conscious, just have a few lines prepackaged to shoot out if you’re caught out and so you’re not fumbling for words. \n\nOnce you’ve built up your confidence, you can let your personality seep out. INTPs are hilarious and I’m sure your humour would be appreciated in normal conversation (: If you want to chat, I can give you some pointers! Discord?
1	Well, no, not our exact opposite, only order opposite. Which means we are actually more similar than we are different.  We have all the same functions so we "speak the same language" but our priorities and and interests are extremely different.\n\nOur true opposite would be ENTJ opposite in order as well as type. We "speak totally different languages" and our interests are extremely different.\n\nESFJ-INTP-ENTJ \n\nFe-Ti -Te\n\nSi-Ne-Ni\n\nNe-Si-Se\n\nTi-Fe -Fi\n\nOK, so anyhow. Your issues are likely not because you are INTP but just in case they are, I'll give you a tip: \n\nThis is how an INTP becomes social. You need to develop your auxiliary function, which is Ne. Extroverted intuition. So speed everything up, go get at it. Go Go Go. It is extremely easy for an INTP to become nihilistic and lazy. Go out for walks and hikes, in nature if you can. Gear your thought process externally, get out of your head. Instead of "how does this work" think: "what are WE/THEY/THIS/IT/HE/SHE going to do next?" Exercise.\n\nOK, here's what I think your actual problem is: \n\nYou are Narcissistic and Solipsistic, but not in a bad way, just in a perceptual way. You're too concerned with what is going on in your head and what others perceive you as that you are too scared to make a move in life, so you unconsciously cower away. What you need to be doing is too stop letting what people think of you be as important as what they are saying or doing. Ask yourself: how can I help this person? What can I do to to help this person do what they want. Focus on them. Not you. You  aren't important enough for people to judge you enough for you to fear social situations. Get into the conversation topic and offer up that INTP genius.
0	Lol!! I'm INTP too and have been on the Intp subreddit ALOT lately after I discovered it like a month ago. Just thought to myself.. hmm I wonder if the other subreddits are as active as ours and I wonder if they are all complaining and asking for help on every post like ours. Randomly chose ESFJ (interesting tho if I may have just subconsciously chose the exact opposite of mine) to see for myself. And then I immediately find an INTP asking for help hahah. No offense or anything, do you- just thought it was funny. 
2	More questions for understanding.	Here is a few questions. I have figured out I am probably not esfj but I still don’t understand fe that well.\n\nDo you esfjs usually consider yourselfs pretty emotional?? Sometimes it is seen as you are and sometimes not that much.\n\n\nAlso there is this thing about ESFJ and fe being very linked to empathy. And that you can just feel other people’s feelings. Is this actually true or is it a horrible stereotype?\n\nOne person already have given a response to this question and I don’t mean to not listen but I want more answers. But fe people including ESFJ is known as social chamaeleons. What do you think of this? Is blending in to your background intentional or just more natural and you just do it without knowing? What do you think of the whole social chamaeleon concept do you agree with it?
2	Yeah as a male ESFJ I am emotional for a guy I guess. I definitely feel peoples emotions and will get choked up with them. We can be very matter of fact if need be, and that is probably the non emotions you see. But I think our emotions are practical. Not the kind of people who will emote to just anything. It has to have real meaning. I am very empathetic for sure. You'd need to explain social chameleon more, I dont think I personally blend into the background unless the group size is really large. If its a 3-5 person group I'm the one taking control usually.
2	I am decently chill most of the time, but sometimes I get in moods and then my emotions will control me. Usually as far as empathy goes, I can deeply understand how most people feel naturally, and I will do everything in my power to understand if I do not. I guess the empathy is a natural thing.\nA few years back my mom told me a story about me when I was two. I was at an Easter event and had a bag full of eggs. She said that I looked over and saw a kid with none, and that I gave all of my eggs to the kid. That makes me think that my empathy started at a young age. As far as the chameleon and blending in. I actually greatly struggle fitting in. Mainly because most of the people I naturally gravitate towards are INTP or INFP who have a completely different thinking process. 
2	YES on all those things.  \n\nSocial Chameleon here for sure.  I sense deeply and find it easy to size up a social situation upon entering.  This allows me to cater to the needs of the crowd without any struggles.  I actually quite enjoy it and look forward to meeting new people or going to events where I'm a newbie.  Much to the delight of my husband who is quite the opposite and whose profession requires lots of hobnobbing.  :)
1	I used to not be emotional, but I was being abused at the time so I shut myself off. Once I started working on fighting that abuse, the emotions just came pouring out. And yes, I can literally feel what others feel. That's part of why I cry so easily, if someone is in pain and they're crying, I'm also crying because I put myself in their shoes. The most dramatic time this happened to me, was when a friend of mine was "retiring" from nannying for this family. The kids had just grown up and didn't need a nanny anymore. But she had nannied them since they were babies, she had been with them their entire lives. When she told me she was starting to look for a new job, I literally burst into tears just thinking about how painful it would be leaving the kids. She wasn't even crying about it. 
4	Its official, I love this subreddit.	Okay so I only browse reddit for the news and, I use flipboard for the news besides that I barely touch my phone except to make plans with people and chat a little over text for people I don't see often. But I found this subreddit and its so damn interesting to hear what people think about ESFJs, Im usually too busy hopping from being with one person to another and then sleeping and repeating that I dont have any time to hear what people think about me. Enlighten me, I am down to hear good and bad stuff, it'll only help me grow.
0	🙄
2	I am looking for answers am I one of you? Don’t know.	I am either a really friendlY ESTJ or a ESFJ that doesn’t like to think about her emotions or consider herself emotional or don’t admit it to herself. I don’t know if there is such a thing Or don’t tell people I care about their emotions or don’t admit that to myself that I actually care about them? I find that I care and worry about others. I know everyone, and find that I can be really super friendly.\n\n\nSo I want you to tell me about yourselfs. How your ESFJness works and what differences you have with ESTJs?  
1	Hey if you want to pick my brain a bit feel free to dm me. Sadly I don't know too much about all the differences between the personality types but if you had any specific questions about how I'd process situations or anything specific about personality I'd be willing to answer some questions! Sorry if this doesn't help much but wanted to offer what I can! 
1	Hello again! We talked on my thread a couple days ago (: Will be more than happy to help type you. But ESTJs can be super sociable and friendly too. Do you have discord?
7	I’m an elusive ESFJ AMA 😂	So I can’t believe I’m doing this but apparently ESFJs don’t frequent their own forums. Too busy  being with people I guess.. anyway I’ve had lots of questions about us and how we work and even got a few PMs from just saying I am one. So if you got a question this is the place to share it so everyone can see! \n\nIf there are any other ESFJs out there feel free to answer the questions also I would be interested to hear others take on similar topics to me. 
5	Lol, we all just show up to say Hi, and no one asks any questions 
3	I am too!! Hi!
2	This should be interesting \*grabs popcorn\* except the stars of the show didn't show up...which is right on for ESFJ's as they have more important things to do than hang out on Reddit.\n\nI've lived with an ESFJ boyfriend for awhile now (INFP, here) and they're the most interesting creatures, ever.  I love learning about them.  (He varies from J/P, on occasion...just as I vary J/P on occasion).  Makes for a fun time, though.  I'd go anywhere with him.  He's a blast.
2	He’s an incredibly stable and reliable person. I can count on him to come through whenever I need him. He’s quite selfless when it comes to helping others. He’s practical,most of the time but if he’s really wanted something or wanted to go somewhere he will work hard to make it happen.\n\nOne of the things we disagree on isn’t really a disagreement but seeing things from a very different perspective.  He’s all about the basics. He would consider say, buying Charmin toilet paper totally unnecessary when he could pay 30% less for cheaper toilet paper....because he’d rather spend his money on a concert ticket that costs $85.  To me $85 on something like that is crazy, but having comfy toilet paper is something I would prefer. \n\nHe’s cheap....unless he’s spending on entertaining, fun stuff. I am not quite the opposite, but my take is more conservative on entertainment and more on creature comforts.  Same with groceries. That’s why I buy the groceries. I can’t do baked beans and store brand Mac and cheese three times a week. 😖\n\nI would travel the world with him because he’s probably one of the most curious, adventurous people I have ever known.  He loves his family deeply and is dedicated to making their lives easy if he can. He’s the baby of the family, but he’s their go to person for anything they need help with.  He’s very sensitive to others feelings most of the time unless he’s frustrated or they’re just not listening to him. When he’s angry he’s really angry but then he’s over it. I’ve had to remind him that I’m pretty easy to hurt, emotionally so he’s patient to no end with me most of the time.  He tries very hard to communicate with me in the way I need him to.\n\nHe tries hard at whatever he has committed himself to. I think that’s what I love most about him.  He’s extremely hard on himself. His standards are incredibly high so I guess if he’s with me it’s because I passed the tests he gave.\n\nI love him dearly.\n\n
1	I am too - where are we all hiding?? Hello from California!
1	Hey! I'm an ISFP. I always see you being happy, but how are you when you're sad? How can I tell and how can I help?
1	Yes! My husband's an intj and his feed is always full of intj tidbits and comments.  Meanwhile I am an esfj and very content just reading questions others ask about esfjs and never commenting back. Why is that? I appreciate all the comments made above, because you are all describing me perfectly!
8	ESFJ Inner Wild	We ESFJs tend to be strict and like to abide by the rules, but every now and then a very uncharacteristic wave comes over me and I just want to do something crazy! \n\nWhat’s the craziest thing you rule-following ESFJs have done?
3	Oh man, on my 21st birthday (just a few weeks ago) I got super drunk for the first time to celebrate but then also made the drunk decision to get cross faded. And I did just that and I don’t know why but I felt like getting crazy that night. It was fun though!
8	I wanna see some more posts from ESFJs	I am an ESFJ and feel lonely in here all you other ESFJs love upvoting but not many comments 😂. 
1	Hey 👋🏼👋🏼😂
1	Hello 😘
1	Hi
1	😁 I'd love to learn a lot more about you guys
1	ENTP, I need to talk to more ESFJ's lol. I need to understand them more than I currently do. 
1	I seriously just thought there were no ESFJs on this sub!! This makes me so happy!
1	Me too, you're lovely :(
1	INFP here...  \n\n\njust got interested how empty some Subreddits of sensors will look like.  \ni feel sorry for you guys :/  \nbut you welcome to join ours :D....
11	ESFJs social media users?	Any other ESFJs out there that kinda hate social media and much prefer face to face contact. I personally just don’t see the use for it at all. The only thing I use is reddit and that’s mostly the news section. 
7	I’m the same way, just reddit and Snapchat. Everything else feels like too much of other people’s business taking up my time and not enough of my own.
3	Duuuude. I thought I was alone. People love to put us in the "ESFJ's love gossip therefore they're obsessed with all forms of social media" box, and that couldn't be further from the truth. I got off Facebook in 2010, I was only on Instagram for about a year and a half, ditto Snapchat. I'm only on Reddit (and I'm not friends with anyone from my real life on here) and Pinterest, which I think you could make the argument that neither of those really fall into the "social media" category because they're largely impersonal. People complain to me on a regular basis about how inconvenient it is that I didn't see their post on whatever whatever . . . Ever since I got off Facebook my philosophy had been this, "If they're really my friend, we'll be friends offline." If they really care about you and want you as part of their life, they'll send you cute pictures. They'll tell you the mundane parts of their day. They'll invite to such and such's party. I found it a really easy way to cut out fake people.
2	Always prefer face to face contact, but I also have many friends in almost every state in the US, some of which I consider close friends, so social media is really nice to see a glimpse into their lives, superficial as that may be. 
3	What type is most compatible with ESFJ?	
4	My grandma and two of my best friends are INFP's. My other BFF is ISFP. I would say I'm definitely drawn to a certain type 😊
3	[ "ESFJ's natural partner is the ISFP, or the INFP."](https://www.personalitypage.com/html/ESFJ_rel.html)
2	Isfp :D from what i have read at least
2	I am ENTP (A bit more on the introverted side) and while it's not one of the posterchild relationships, I did last almost 3-years with an ESFJ girl. Don't count us out haha. 
4	Most my friends are INTJs
4	Multiple theories:\n\n1. You want someone who is your opposite via dichotomies (letters) for balance and learning each other's opposite sides for better growth. So, INTP.\n\n2. You want someone who is your functional opposite for the same reasons. So, ENTJ.\n\n3. You want someone who leads with your weakest function or is different from you in all dichotomies aspects except for N/S which can be left alone. So, INTP or ISTP.\n\n4. You want someone who is the "mirror" of you functionally. So, ISFP.\n\nI personally subscribe to the first and third ones, but you do you. I'm an ISTP and I currently have a wonderful ESFJ best friend.
1	I'm an ISFP and I think our type gets on really well with ESFJs. My former childhood friend was an ESFJ and it was great. 
1	I like introverts but they usually aren't that into me. I'm best with other extroverts. 
1	I loved banging my INFP ex gf. Super hot in bed and sweet as hell until it all unraveled and fell apart.
3	How would an ESFJ react if they were dumped?	*(The question implies that you still have feelings for said person)*
12	We get a lot of our self worth from what others think. So it depends how it happens. Saying it’s not you its me is the worst way to dump us. We will blame ourselves. You gotta pin point the actual reason and be honest. 
2	Depends on their attachment style, how the breakup occurred, etc.  Big triggers would be shared social network where the Fe function would focus on how the change in group dynamic will effect all the friendships. 
1	No one likes being dumped. Just do it an let them deal with it with people that care about them. There is nothing you can do to make it painless. Just be direct and final and give them space.
2	Looking for advice to attract an esfj (as an isfp type)?	So from what i have read isfp's match well romanticly with esfj's :). \n\nSource: https://youtu.be/vZCDSX50vT8\n\nI would love to get some insight into attracting and finding an female esfj to date. I have simple questions like:\n\n- what are some good places to meet with you?\n- what are some big don'ts, especially during first contact? \n\nAny tips in general are welcome!:)
1	I am an ESFJ, what’s the ISFP like?
1	I’m an ESFJ, ESFJs usually like to be around people all the time. They often take you wanting freedom as you not wanting to be around them and they’ll decide quickly your not worth it. They can tell easily where your comfort level is with being outgoing and being around people and appreciate when you go go out of it and takes that as a compliment. 
8	Esfj's what's your go to breakup song?	
4	If I really had to pick: Palace by Sam Smith\n\nIt reminds me that real love is never a waste of time, now matter how much it hurts. \n\nI like songs that really mirror my current feelings and circumstance. They each have a line that resonates with my entire being. \n\nA bit overkill but this is all that is currently in my break up playlist:\n\nBaby, You Make me Crazy - Sam Smith\n\nLove You Anymore - Michael Bublé\n\nTruthfully - DNCE\n\nHotel Ceiling - Rixton\n\nOne Day at a Time - Sam Smith\n\nI’ve Told You Now - Sam Smith\n\nStill on Your Mind - Ethan DeRose\n\nImpossible - James Arthur\n\nWithout the Love - Demi Lovato\n\nTears Dry on Their Own - Amy Winehouse\n\nSorry not Sorry - Demi Lovato\n\nI Won’t Cry - Jay Ollero\n\nAll the Stars - Kendrick Lamar ft. SZA\n\nI Like Me Better - Lauv\n\nNearness is to Love - Urban Zakapa\n\nI Will Never Let You Down - Rita Ora\n\nPalace - Sam Smith\n\nWhy Don’t You Love Me - Hot Chelle Rae\n\nIn the Silence - JP Cooper\n\nCan I be Him? - James Arthur\n\nOnly Love Can Hurt Like This - Faith Paloma\n\nHurt Somebody - Noah Kahan\n\nAll We Know - The Chainsmokers\n\nTell Me You Love Me - Galantis and Throttle\n\nLet it Go - James Bay\n
5	Silver Lining by Garfunkel and Oates.
3	Actually have a whole playlist of songs I listened to after my ex broke up with me: [https://open.spotify.com/user/1243496029/playlist/6IDkOD70fpnhQpQ7IetYUr?si=nrrfAU8cQuWIraUbkcle5A](https://open.spotify.com/user/1243496029/playlist/6IDkOD70fpnhQpQ7IetYUr?si=nrrfAU8cQuWIraUbkcle5A)  \n\n\n  \nIf i had to pick one though, it'd be "thank you for being a friend" by Andrew Gold ([https://open.spotify.com/track/5yNUgA66PbcPIJPOU2eBwR?si=IQaAl2yWQ0ChGo\_OxoYyxA](https://open.spotify.com/track/5yNUgA66PbcPIJPOU2eBwR?si=IQaAl2yWQ0ChGo_OxoYyxA))  \nIt has a nice message to me and is a good send off in my mind. To me i viewed it as "Thanks for being a friend, but now it's over"  \n\n\nSimilarly the song "Stole the Show" by Kygo is along the same lines. The lyrics   \n\n\n" [No heroes, villains, one to blame](https://genius.com/Kygo-stole-the-show-lyrics#note-5091727)  \n[While wilted roses fill the stage](https://genius.com/Kygo-stole-the-show-lyrics#note-5091727)  \n[And the thrill, the thrill is gone](https://genius.com/Kygo-stole-the-show-lyrics#note-5091727)  \n[Our debut was a masterpiece](https://genius.com/Kygo-stole-the-show-lyrics#note-5091727)  \n[But in the end, for you and me](https://genius.com/Kygo-stole-the-show-lyrics#note-5091727)  \n[Oh, the show, it can't go on](https://genius.com/Kygo-stole-the-show-lyrics#note-5091727)  \n\n\n\[Chorus: Parson James\]  \n[We used to have it all, but now's our curtain call](https://genius.com/Kygo-stole-the-show-lyrics#note-5079283)  \n[So hold for the applause, oh](https://genius.com/Kygo-stole-the-show-lyrics#note-5079283)  \n[And wave out to the crowd, and take our final bow](https://genius.com/Kygo-stole-the-show-lyrics#note-5079283)  \n['Cause it's our time to go, but at least we stole the show](https://genius.com/Kygo-stole-the-show-lyrics#note-5079283)  \n[Least we stole the show](https://genius.com/Kygo-stole-the-show-lyrics#note-5079283) " (Source: [https://genius.com/Kygo-stole-the-show-lyrics](https://genius.com/Kygo-stole-the-show-lyrics))  \n\n\nreally resonated with me personally because  \n\n\n>"No heroes, villains, one to blame" \n\nTo me stood out as like, it's no ones fault this didn't work out, it's just ending  \n\n\n>"Our debut was a masterpiece  \nbut in the end for you and me  \nOh, the show, it can't go on"\n\nFor me the start of the relationship was kind of amazing. It was my first and a lot of people were happy for me and so it seemed like a big thing. Both me and my gf at the time would post quotes from each other that seemed like cute couple things but as time went on those became less and less, so even though the beginning was great, it's not so great anymore  \n\n\n>"We used to have it all, but now's our curtain call  \nso hold for the applause, oh  \nand wave out to the crowd, and take our final bow  \n'cause it's our time to go, but at least we stole the show"\n\nWe used to be great, but now it's time for this to end. Give one final wave/ bow, but now this is ending, and me and my friends won't be seeing you again. Or at least that's what it meant to me with my situation  \n\n\n"Flowers On The Wall" by Eric Heatherly was another song I listened to a lot after the breakup. It's about a guy who's depressed about the breakup but is trying to come off like he's not.   \n\n\nSorry this comment was super long wasn't sure if you were asking for advice on songs to listen to after a breakup or just curious in general\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;

1	Is it faux pas to comment a week and a half late? How does this whole commenting business work? I was excited to find this subreddit then disappointed when I saw it wasn't very active then realized I had no reason to feel disappointed when all I ever do is lurk and only get on reddit every couple weeks!\n\nHere's my list, I got a little carried away! I know there are a ton more but this is all I got off the top of my head.

4	Struggles with ESFJ mom	I am here looking for advice on how to deal with my super curious mom. We have very different levels of what we're willing to share and she makes an awful lot of questions. She just asks about everything and then sometimes I have to lie, a thing I don't want to do.\n\nThings got more complicated lately as I got in a homosexual relationship with another girl, a thing I'm sure my parents would be against if they found out. She already suspects and she would probably want to say "I knew it", but not want it to be true at the same time. I asked my mom to give me space and not find it necessary to know every detail of my life, but even though she said I can do whatever I want, I still sensed resentment in the way she talked.\n\nI want to have a healthy relationship with her, where we have a more understanding communication.
3	I dug around your profile a bit to see if I could find your type... I'm sorry... but I saw that you're istp.  I'm isfp with an esfj mom and hooooo boy, do I feel your relationship conundrum.  Everyone's relationship is different regardless but first and foremost you're going to have to set some boundaries for yourself and you're going to have to enforce them.  I think you might also have to decide what's worth more to you-- a more open relationship with your mom, with the knowledge that your sharing might not lead to a deeper understanding on her part, or a closer watch on your own heart and mind.  And if you're feeling that for all her curiosity, she doesn't really know you, well, it might just be something you need to make peace with and appreciate the easy connections and know she loves you, regardless.  
2	Hmmm...have you tried initiating the conversation so you can choose the topic and steer it in the way you want?  I think she's looking for ways to connect with you and learn about who you are and how to best support you (very wild guess, sorry).  So if you reach out to her about safe topics, you can help her feel connected but in a way that doesn't feel prying?  Talk about work, or school, hobbies and friendships, but be in control?  Does that make sense?
8	How to Get Along With ESFJ Mom?	Hey so I'm a 19yo Male who happens to be an INTJ. I have always been very introverted and spend lots of time in my own thoughts. My mom is an ESFJ who is constantly wanting to have conversations and share her opinions even though I prefer not to talk unless necessary. Of course I am open to having meaningful conversations but only if my mind isn't on something else that I'm trying to solve.\n\n As you can see our personalities clash and we tend to not get along when I'm at home. I'll be living at home until I graduate College and I would love some tips on how to get along with an ESFJ and make sure she understands my needs. Thanks!
1	My best advice would be to just be honest. When you aren't open to having conversations just say, "I'm not really in the mood for a big conversation right now." She might be a little bummed but honesty is the best policy. I'm not really sure I can think of any "tips" 
1	I’m an istp. I’ll get along with your mom. :)
12	What do you think about us INTPs since we are basically opposite of you?	
10	I wouldn’t say INTPs are the opposites of ESFJs. After all, we do share all the same cognitive functions but in reverse. I have commented on INTPs before but I’ll say it again. \n\nPersonally, I find INTPs fascinating. The way your Ti works is mesmerising to me. I like to listen to the way INTPs constantly question ideas to fully understand concepts and trace them back to their individual axioms. This is something I really struggle with and I have posted in your sub to help develop my own Ti. I was expecting to be completely ousted from the sub but apart from a couple of trolls, they were mostly very inviting and accepting. I have made a couple of INTP friends in this process and found to my pleasant surprise, that we get along very well.\n\nINTPs have a very rich inner world that I think they have trouble expressing. Most INTPs that reached out to me after my thread was active, mostly either communicated to me either solely through memes or responded in essays to comments of a couple sentences. But once they have overcome that communication barrier (by that, I mean subjectively in a conventional way so that an ESFJ understands :D), I find INTPs fascinating to chat to and debate with. I like the way INTPs challenge the way I think and I think such a pairing promotes a lot of growth.\n\nBasically, y’all great.
3	ESFJ here, I'd trade for your left brain. I, unfortunately, need more of that in my life.
2	INTPs and ESFJs speak the same language but have different goals. I'm an ESFJ and my best friend of \~9 years is an INTP, we are really great at helping each other develop our fourth functions. When we look to accomplish a goal, I'm great at mapping, organizing, and maintaining, while he's great at theorizing, developing, and sort of hole-poking. I like his casual ease at using Ti. The best thing about INTPs is that they don't give the slightest sliver of a fuck about "who" you are, and moreso "what" you are. He only cares about truth. I care about authenticity. Which isn't the same thing. 
2	I am an ESFJ, and I seem to be an INTP/INFP magnet. 3 out of my 7 closest friends are INTPs. So here is my thought on them. Personally I really enjoy spending time with them, and learning about how different types of people think. My favorite thing about INTPs is their ideas and thoughts, they are very thought invoking. Their worst trait however is that they cannot realize their own flaws, and that sometimes that have difficulty understanding feelings. 
1	Based on my experience:\n\nThey gave great advice. Interesting insight on the world. I also see that the mature ones attempt polite small talk with me, and I really appreciate that. Some discussions with them were quite delightful\n\nOtherwise communication was exceedingly difficult. I found that they had misinterpreted things I said and vice versa. It's the Fe-dom Ti-dom clash. 
2	Youtuber C.S. Joseph Concludes That Oprah Winfrey Is ESFJ	
2	He doesn't regret it	My bf (INTP) and I (ESFJ) are Christian and I don't think we should have sex before marriage, but my bf has. I asked him if he could go back and change losing his virginity, and if he regretted it.\n\nHe said, "I mean I guess? Yeah?" And it was so careless like he didn't care. Even if it's not a Christian thing, shouldn't he want me to be his only one, so he should regret having sex with someone else? Is he losing interest? What do I do? I'm shaking.\n\nMy friend says he shouldn't regret his past just to show he loves me and I have to accept that he isn't a virgin. But I did! It was a deal breaker but because I love him, I am still dating him! Shouldn't he at least regret not saving himself for me? 
6	Hey, I come from a religion where abstinence/purity is the most important thing we learned about growing up, so I assure you I know what the sacrifice is like and how hurtful it may be that you saved your purity for your partner while they were unable to provide that for you. It's a very touchy topic in my church and I know it can be a very difficult obstacle to overcome, for both parties. However, if he didn't grow up with that same value and intention as you did, I do not think it's fair for you to hold that against him. Heck, even if he did, I still do not think it would be fair. I don't think he should have to regret losing his purity in order to prove his love to you. His love to you is what he gives you now, it's not about what he wishes he could take back from his past.  \nI'm also of the belief that people should not have regrets, but rather learn to accept whatever choices they made in the past, even if they were bad choices. If you want your relationship to work, you need to forgive him. Making him try to regret something he doesn't regret, or just saying those words, will not make the relationship better because that just means you are avoiding taking the responsibility of forgiving him. "Forgiveness is letting go of the hope that the past can be changed." If you love him, you'll forgive him.  \n
9	Why would you want him to regret it? He obviously loves you if he's willing to wait for you to have sex again. I think it's really shitty to expect someone to feel guilty for something in their past that they did before they knew you. It changes nothing. I'm honestly not even sure if this is a troll post or not.
2	A life full of regret is not an abundant life. I understand where you're coming from, I am saving my virginity until after marriage as well. But to expect a man to go through past events in his minds and be regretful isn't helping. It lowers your frequency and hinders you to grow into a loving, high-chakred person.\n\nJesus, for example, had a very high frequency - the highest possible, he was one with god. Guilt is one of the lowest frequencies one could have, along with self hatred and the like. It attracts other negative things that are of the same frequency. So wishing your boyfriend to experience guilt is not a good thing, though I understand the disappointment.
2	Hi intp here, I just wanted to let the esfjs here know that this was also posted in the intp channel as well. It’s saying something when both esfj and intp both agree with each other on the major points. I’m glad the responses match up. 
1	Here's the thing:\n\nYou strongly value sex only after marriage. There's nothing wrong with that, and I don't care what others think.\n\nLet's put it a different way- Let's say your partner was not Christian. Let's say he was an Atheist. Or he becomes an Atheist. Something you are dead against.\n\nWould you be able to stay with him? Would, and I quote, "because I love him" still be enough?\n\nI am asking these because you have EVERY right to have certain values in a relationship. However, other people may not necessarily comply, and I want you to consider whether this- him having no regrets- is a deal breaker or something you can work through and get over?
1	lol, i hope this is not representative of esfjs
1	Hi, you sound like marriage is your biggest dream. Please remember, do not rather hear lies since it's building a castle on the sand. He was honest with you but you are not wrong to feel hurt for receiving a careless reaction. What I want to tell is that you must decide wether or not it's bearable to carry during the lifelong of it. I mean, if after both of you decide to get together, forgiving it and going for it, you throw once in a while he did not save himself for you, that had be mining the relationship since one cannot change past. Maybe he had relationship with someone he thought was the one, maybe not. But if it happened, and he told you, he is being vulnerable to you knowing it's really important to you. He could hide it but he rather keep things transparent. That is the right thing to do. If he lied, you would be entering an illusion and it would hurt way more afterwards, with his discomfort knowing he has done it and it's important to you. If he wants to marry you, that means he finds you are the one. [Edit]  Maybe, try to find counselling from experienced people on church and christian pages on internet too?
1	Not to be a dick, but OP is ESFJ and female. She just wants you to agree with her. If you look at how she poses questions to your answers, she's leading you to agree with her. Inert Ti doing it's thang. Open up your mind young ESFJ. Only then will you find the true answers not your answers. -ESFJ male here.
1	What happened had happened and nothing he says will change it. But he's not going to sugar coat it for you. I'd think INTPs want to tell the truth as it is most of the time. They're not prone to people pleasing...\n\nI've met INTPs that did tell me they wished they could have done things differently but I think they also appreciate that their past allows them to arrive to the present. \n\nI know that it hurts to think he doesn't care as much as you want him to care, but maybe he does and just can't find the right words and actions to make you feel better. Have you spoken to him about it? I think it's alright to tell him how you feel and how you want your feelings to be reciprocated. But it's also important to hear him out too if you're going to have that kind of talk. 
1	Ridiculous. Forced abstinence is dumb. Believe me, you want to make sure that your sexually compatible with another person before you commit the rest of your life to them. It just seems like you want to control him and are very jealous. Also, regret is for the birds. The now is all we have!!
1	This is a prime example of the kinds of misunderstandings that an INTP and an ESFJ in a relationship will have. An INTP is very unlikely to see any value to regret except to foster resolve in order to prevent repeating the action again.\n\nFor example, I'm an INTP and a few years ago I rear-ended a vehicle because I was following too close under icy conditions. Now when I drive I give more space, to the point that when more aggressive drivers are riding with me they comment that I'm letting too many people space to merge into my lane! I don't regret the accident because it made me a safer driver in the long run.\n\nIf I were to try to put myself in your boyfriend's shoes I would probably be at a loss for words when asked a question like you asked him. It's not logical and we value logical consistency in most cases.\n\nThat being said, I was raised in a traditional Christian home and I heard many times to "Save yourself for marriage" and anecdotes from people that told teens how having sex before marriage would spoil the experience of the first time. It's easy to see how those things are to internalize. With a few decades of reflection I've concluded that these methods of discouraging pre-maritial sex are not healthy and, in my opinion, not Biblical either.\n\nIn conclusion, I think your need here is to have your feelings acknowledged by your boyfriend. If that's the case then say something like "I know my feelings are illogical, but I would appreciate if you listened to what I have to say. I'm not asking you to regret previous actions but I'm looking forward to growing our relationship together from a position of understanding."
3	Do ESFJ's not like being helped themselves?	So I'm an E/I-STJ (I've typed as both) and in an on and off relation ship with an ESFJ girl. I know ESFJ's are know for being one of the most helpful personality types, but do they hate being helped themselves?\n\n Let me explain: When we first started our relationship, she was the one always doing things for me. She would make me food almost everyday, frequent sex, good morning texts and everything in between. I wanted to start reciprocating more, but at the same time figured what I was doing was clearly working and I should just keep this up. Maybe she likes the "hard to get" type. We weren't official at the time but it started to feel like it. Fast forward a few months and I started to feel guilty like I was using her so I wanted to tell her what a wonderful woman she was and how happy I was to have her in my life.  Us  XSTJ's aren't exactly know for our warm fuzzy feelings so to say the least, it took a huge effort. I started buying her food as well, started to tell her things I admired about her, and just generally opening up to her. I was doing this for about a month and a half. One day I noticed she was really upset about car trouble she was having, her new job, and her kid. She started taking her anger out on me over a trivial argument and I got a bit mad myself. Eventually my good side within me won and I told her it's ok for her to feel stressed under all of that load. I brought her to my place, let her sleep while I took care of her kid, gave her a massage, bought her food, and took her to work after. It was then the weekend and she said she was a bit tired, and would be busy doing family stuff. Come Monday, I try to give her a kiss and she pulled away. And I was like "what's going on?" and she said she thought she wasn't ready to be in a relationship now. Which came as a shock considering I've recently started being nicer to her. I did a little experiment and decided to not give a shit, banter with her, and only worry about my needs. Lo and behold, she starts flirting back, we kiss, and get back together. Then as soon as I started trying to reciprocate all the stuff she gives, she pulls away again. So after that, I started being less available and being emotionally cold again, she posts all these sad facebook posts and now recently saw her and she is touching, flirting with me again. \n\n\nSo what's the deal here? I would like to know if some ESFJs (notice I said some, not all) suffer from an insecurity and feel the need to be the more helpful one so they can feel "in control" so their partner will never leave? Does it feel uncomfortable when their partner feels the need to match their level of helpfulness at least some of the time? I don't seek to criticize or judge, only to understand. Any insight is much appreciated. 
9	ESFJ here. I love serving, but get uncomfortable when people serve me. It takes real effort to allow people to do things for me. \n\nThe way I get around this faulty wiring is to realize that when I don’t graciously allow others to do things for me, I’m denying them the same joy I get from helping others. That usually leads to an upward spiral of two people being great to each other and a really solid relationship. \n\nEdit: notice my unintentional use of words “allow people to do things for me”, as if I’m still in control, lol
2	Based on my experience, it seems you've hit the nail on the head. 
1	Boyfriend is ESFJ and he doesn't like accepting  help, but he does like positive affirmation and being called sweet names. When reading your post I kind of feel like she's on the extreme end of the spectrum.
1	I am an ESFJ, I am in a relationship with an INTP. I try to be as affectionate as possible and he tries to do the same. A lot of times I think that their happiness is more important than my own and will try extra hard to make them feel appreciated. I sometimes feel like making them bring me happiness is a burden to them and try not to let them. (After all INTPs are not know for supporting emotions) \n\nSo maybe your situation is similar where she thinks that your happiness should be placed above all, and she feels guilty when she feels like a burden. Truthfully you should just talk it out with her. 
1	this is not esfj, this is more of an attachment style thing. is that your kid or hers?
5	Do you prefer comfort or quickness when dealing with menial tasks?	I'm pretty sure this person I know is ESFJ and I've always noted a major difference in the way we approach small problems or chores - I prefer to do it as quickly as possible and the ESFJ really likes to take his time with stuff like that. For example, if I have to do a lot of dishes I'll just get to it asap to get it over with. If he has to do dishes, he's gonna turn on a podcast, lay some towels around, make himself a cup of coffee, do some stretches etc And it's the same thing in any similar situation\n\nFunction wise, I think this is an Si comfort vs Se impatience sort of thing. What do you think?
3	Yeah, that is interesting... I'm ENTP and always want to get things done quickly as well so I'm not sure it's a Si vs Se thing
2	I do prefer doing chores in a way that is fun for me! So comfort all the way
1	My ESFJ boyfriend might put on some music but he's very get-up-and-go with chores for the most part.
1	I think it depends. If I'm stressed, it's a "get this over with". If I'm in a good mood, it's the second :)
1	Lol, I'm an ESFJ, and I say fuck doing chores. I'll put my clothes in a stack, fold them in half, and toss that shit in my drawer. Waste 30 hours doing that? You kidding me?

8	INFP needs advice dating ESFJ	I (INFP) just started dating an ESFJ at the beginning of December and it has been wonderful. For the first in my 14 months of singledom, I've finally met a guy who I could see in the long run. He is thoughtful, sweet, generous, chivalrous, open-minded, funny, and we share similar interests - it's amazing. And although we only had 4 wonderful dates together in a span of 2 weeks (I had to keep the distance between the dates), the dates were full experiences, lasting nearly 40 hours total. The best part about these dates was that we never needed technology to steer conversation, we were always fully present in the moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I had to go home (to a different continent) for 10 days following our last date. While I was away, we would text often and FaceTime, and he even gave me Christmas gifts which he insisted that I open in front of my family (which made it seem like he wanted his presence in my life known by my family). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe's such a good planner, he would always plan dates ahead of time, and showed his "both feet in" interest following our first date. But it feels that something has changed since I got back (yesterday). Since he's such a good planner and was so keen to see me, I expected that he would want to see me right away! But it hasn't been that way. He seemed quite distracted yesterday when I returned. I sent him a picture of his x-mas gift that I brought back (which is a perishable item) and asked when he wants me to give it to him, and his response was "I'm trying to find some time before I go snowboarding x" which I think is Jan 3 or 5th. He did reach out again to me today, and his messages have been sweet and full of xx, but he still hasn't made any motion to try and see me. My initial reaction is to close up and send very dry responses, because I just don't understand this change in behavior. I really like this guy and I want it to work out, but my now fragile heart is scared of being hurt again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've read that ESFJs are very loyal, and although we weren't officially together, he told me that I'm the first person (in a year) that he wanted to go on a second date with. He also planted many seeds in my head that he would be sticking it out for the long run. I've also read that ESFJs need a lot of positive affirmation, and perhaps my dry responses are pushing him away? He told me a few times how honest he is, so I'm thinking of messaging him saying, "You've always said how honest you are, and I really respect that. I've noticed you been a bit distant lately, is everything okay?" or something along those lines. I don't want to push him away, but at the same time, I don't want to play games and I need authenticity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; How should I communicate with an ESFJ if I feel they are going distant? What pushes them away, and what brings them closer? If an ESFJ is super into someone for a few weeks, how likely is that feeling to disappear?
6	Yes dear they need affirmation but there are other factors to consider. Did you say something that might made him upset? Fes dont want to know that you offended them because they dont want unnecessary confrontation. Fes can be honest but most of the time they dont want unwanted confrontation ( in my own experience with fe dominants)\n\nAffirmation is what brings them closer to you and if they see you are paying attention to them, they will be drawn towards you (imo experience). \n\nTry to message him like hi how are you and maybe he might strike up a conversation. Maybe he has other personal priorities? \n\nIf it has been weeks and hes still not responding then dont wait anymore. If he's really honest then he will tell you right away. He is not your responsibility anyways and that is his problem not yours.
2	Yeah I'd be as straight forward as you can. Just asking straight up "hey I feel like we've been growing distant recently. Do you feel the same way?" or something and go from there. See if maybe they're just not interested. Idk, personally I like it when someone is straight forward with how they're feeling
1	Boy oh boy, do I have an answer for you.\n\nI am an INFP,\nMy mother, friend, and ex are ESFJs.\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: ESFJs can be great as friends to rant to, because when you rant to them, they will be angry with you. They don't see the need to understand the other side, so you can feed off each other's anger and vent it all out. Same goes for any other emotion, I guess. As an INFP myself, it is nice to have someone support my side and encourage me to be selfish every now and then and just let my anger roar. \n\nMy advice from personal experience: ESFJs question everything as "you must not love me anymore". They do not have the intuition to understand that love comes in many different ways, so it is hard for them to appreciate love shown in ways they aren't "programmed" to receive. It is hard for INFPs, because we have our own moral code that we uphold, and we take huge offense to someone believing we are less than moral.\n\nFrom a girl's perspective of another ESFJ girl: Maybe through my friend's patterns, you can understand your guy a little better? To be honest, an ESFJ's thought process and insecurities can give me a headache. I love my friend, but when I hear her love problems, I can't really understand, despite being quite empathetic most of the time. She will freak out about things as small as not receiving a reply from her boyfriend for a few hours while he is at work, and will automatically think he must have met someone new. I usually calm her down and very firmly tell her: "Either you trust him and stay with him, or you believe he's a horrible person and you dump him. It's not that hard." For me, it's kind of a no-brainer. If you are so scared of him cheating, then he's either a serial cheater that you should dump, or you have to learn to trust he isn't. Instead of taking my advice of dumping him or changing her perspective, she usually starts putting him through tests, because she allegedly loves him and doesn't want to lose him. "Let's see if he texts first," is her go-to test. To this day, I still have not failed in receiving an upset phone call even if he does text first, because he texted too late, or the text isn't apologizing, or sweet enough. Maybe by going on a trip, you didn't give him enough affirmation and love, and now he's in his scared-mode, testing the waters, trying to figure out if you still like him, and if you will apologize for not talking as much as you "should have".\n\nAs an INFP girl who dated an ESFJ guy:\nI had a really hard time coping with trying to please the ESFJ. As an introvert, I was ok with "together time" being working on things or watching movies within the same room. I was ok with playing with our phones whipe eating together, because to me, we didn't need to chat about useless stuff. (Obviously not on a first date. I'm talking about once we got comfortable with each other) But for him, it was me losing interest and he couldn't understand that sending him encouraging notes randomly, booking a trip to Japan together, helping him in finding a new job, and other things were my ways of showing love. \n\nAnother thing that struck me as really odd and trying -- I was going through a really tough time at home because of some family issues. He met my parents around that time, and apparently the fact that my parents didn't like him offended him. (I stuck up for him, I didn't let them bash on him) He didn't even talk to me or tell me that something was wrong when I asked. He just randomly decided one day to stop saying "I love you", and if I told him so, he'd say "Okay." I was already going through a lot, and I was still mustering up the energy and courage to stick up for him AND spend time with him. Turns out he wanted me to APOLOGIZE for the situation, because it made HIM feel awkward! All I needed was for HIM to give me some affirmation, but he was so insecure about my parents not liking him that he decided to "punish me" (his words, not mine). I asked him honestly then where he felt like our relationship was at, and he said "Better than ever" (not sarcastic). For him, he forgave me already, but needed me to apologize before he could tell me that he loves me.\n\nWe obviously didn't work out very well as a couple. But we are fine as friends now. \n\nIf your guy is anything like the guy I dated, I don't think anything is particularly "wrong" persay. He might think you guys are better than ever, except he's waiting for you to apologize for leaving him alone while you were with family for 10 whole days.\n\nIf your guy is like my friend, then maybe he is just putting up his guards, and wants to be sure you like him. Which you can probably prove you do by apologizing for leaving him all by his lonesome for 10 days and not telling him how much you missed him every few seconds. 
1	So... I can speak on this. I'm ESFJ, and I've encountered this many times before with my exes. I feel horrible because I realize now I've wasted their time. Tbh, I think the honeymoon phase is over, and he's more or less over it. He probably just wants to do him, and was trying to live up to what your expectations were-maybe his too. Now, he's probably exhausted because he put a lot of effort in, and he wants to call it quits. He did this because he thought he was doing it for you/to get you to like him. He probably thinks that he has to keep doing this stuff to make you like him. He's young, and trying to figure himself out. He also probably feels bad because you liked that version of him, but he knows he can't keep it up. He needs to learn to like himself. I guarantee this guy loathes himself.\n\nI don't mean to be a jerk by divulging this information, but I know it'll help. You can test this if you want. Give him an ultimatum, he'll feel bad and give you effort. Then, it'll die out. You'll notice a trend too. It'll be 2 months perfect, then slowly dies off. You do another ultimatum, it'll be 1 month perfect and dies off. And eventually, it'll just be hell. It'll be a push and pull/pulling of teeth. Pure emotional rollercoaster you definitely don't want to be in. It's up to you though. We all make decisions; some of us have to learn from them the hard way.
1	INFJ male needs Advise from ESFJ female [bedroom advise]	Hi guys I’m an INFJ male, my wife is an ESFJ, we have a quite strong relationship and love each other very much.\n\nIt’s hard for her at the moment as she suffers CFS and PTSD so I’m picking up most of the slack and working full time and I’m ok with it, but it do see it makes her feel guilty at times but I think she copes the best way she can.\n\nThe question I have is i suck with expressing myself in the bedroom, she says I’m hopeless telling stories to turn her on (that I always use a similar one) she says she likes hardcore male in control type fantasies, but not very clear.\n\nI would love to ask the ESFJ community what turns you on and can you offer me any advise on what I need to be learning/researching to make my beautiful wife feel more relaxed than make things uncomfortable, as I care about her enjoyment so much.
1	Not an ESFJ but tell her a story about how you would overpower her and do what you wanted with her. Cherry on top would be that you wanted to pleasure her "against her will" before doing anything for yourself. It sounds like she might be into some level of domination, which is not uncommon. 
1	She doesn't sound esfj at all. Are you sure? They are usually traditional. 
1	Read the book "Sex God Method"\n\nIt's no longer in production but there is a PDF on scribd.
10	Anyone actually a shy/quiet type?	I think the stereotype is that ESFJs are loud mouths who blabber to anyone in sight. \n\nHowever, I'm pretty shy most of the time, especially around strangers. I get terrified at the thought of accidentally bothering someone. Just that I believe I'm an extrovert as I get "recharged" by positive interactions with people rather than by being by myself.
5	Yeah, I'm definitely a reserved person when I'm first meeting people. Warm, but slow to talk. It seems like I have a need to figure that person out before I put myself out there. I have a tendency to want to know how to present myself -- not in the sense that I'm being fake, but I'm wanting to know how (style of speaking, level of energy, subject matter, sense of humor, etc) I should engage them.\n\nOnce I'm completely comfortable, that's when I start to look a little more like the ESFJ stereotype
6	I’m mostly the same. In fact, I’m outright awkward if I’m in an unfamiliar situation with people I don’t know. I do enjoy being around people but loud parties and too many people can really drain me unless I actually know and like everyone there. I prefer small, intimate settings where I can really talk to people. I have been told that I am good at listening and talking (I do sometimes hog the conversation, purely because my Ne goes at a million miles an hour if you get it going) but that only comes out when I feel comfortable.\n\nI thought I was an introvert for the longest time until I realised that being on my own for too long makes me sad. I need people!
3	I'm not shy/quiet, but I'm definitely more reserved and consider myself a listener more than a talker. 
1	Yes and No. I can put on a facade, but I truly want most people to fuck off most of the time. 
17	ESFJ and INTP couple	
5	How do I manage ESFJ subtle silent treatment?	Living with esfj male for yrs, as entp female.  
8	My ESFJ does this as a defense mechanism when he doesn't want to acknowledge how hurt he is about something. If it's me who hurt him he will be cold to me but normal around everyone else. If I ask what is wrong he might say nothing is wrong. It's only happened a couple of times but basically what I did was I forced the conversation by repeatedly saying "I know something is wrong so please talk to me." At this point I notice he might lash out and say hurtful things, but usually they don't make sense and I don't get offended. After a bit of back and forth he was able to express what was wrong and things got better. He always apologizes way too much for acting childish but it shows he understands it's unacceptable. In my case it almost seemed like he didn't 100% know why he was upset but just that he was, so that's why it was so hard to get him to talk about it. He was probably just very stressed about everything and it all built up. ESFJs aren't used to focusing on their own feelings, and just like us they try to avoid them.

4	ESFJs! Do you think Ralph from Wreck-it Ralph is an ESFJ? (probably Spoiler alert)	So, I've watched Wreck-it Ralph 2 or Ralph breaks the internet if you want to call it that, aaaand I think he is an ESFJ, based on his actions and behaviour and desires in both movies, in the first movie he seeks to change his life because he felt like he wasn't loved, he went to try and get a medal and you know how the rest goes, and in the second movie the plot gets kickstarted when Ralph builds a new track for Vanellope since she wants something new and he wants her to be happy, but when Vanellope fights for control with the player they have to go to the internet to save Sugar Rush  aaaand I would go on with the movie's whole plot, but I feel like it could be resumed, everything Ralph does in the movie is for Vanellope's  sake, and one of the reasons Ralph doesn't like Vanellope going to Slaughter Race is that he feels is not appropriate for her because it's too violent, too scary, etc, despite Vanellope loving the game, long story short he's clingy  and overprotective and learns not to be that, letting Vanellope grow up and pursue her dreams, I feel like his Si was very strong with his desire to leave things as they were... and, what do YOU  think about Ralph? do you think he's an ESFJ? why? 
1	I disagree but I think you're very close! I think Ralph is INFP. I don't disagree with anything you said about him, but I disagree that those things imply Fe. Ralph, in the first movie, is trying to define his role and, to a greater extent, his identity. He isn't satisfied by what he was born into and feels conflicted about his internal belief in right vs wrong. The movie is about him accepting that his role is one of good and that he isn't limited by his title. I haven't seen the second movie yet, but from your description and from what I've heard, it seems to be Ralph coming into another conflict of right and wrong. On the one side, he believes children her age shouldn't be exposed to violence of a certain degree. But on the other, he recognizes why this makes her feel good and why it's important to her, and believes that she should have what she wants. And I imagine the ending is about him accepting that the second one is more important than the first. Am I right?\n\nFe tends to be quite relativistic, in that it assesses right and wrong based on the contents of the situation at hand, rather than by forming universal rules that it tries to apply in every situation. I think if Ralph was an Fe user, then the conflict of the movie would never have taken place. He'd have seen plainly that Vanellope was competent and that the game was making her happy, and simply accepted this.\n\nWhat do you think?
4	Ever wonder if you are actually sentient?	 I do this often. Kind of a habit of mine. Lol dishes. 
5	Thought I would check out this subreddit. A tumbleweed just crossed my path
2	If you do you're sure as hell not an ESFJ, sounds like INTP to me 
1	If you have to ask, you don't know.
3	Gift giving ESFJ's	ENTP here...\nGal I dated then realized she's a hot mess.\nRegardless as friends she keeps bringing me gifts.... What will make it stop????
2	Tried that and she was devastated
2	She sounds immature/desperate. Don’t think this has to do with her MBTI.
2	Tell her it makes you feel uncomfortable
2	Dude I am ENTP and dated an ESFJ.\nGift giving might be her love language. Not sure if she has feelings for you still or not but that's what it sounds like to me. 
1	Reconnected end of April.. She's been to my place 25 times since.. 20 of them she brought something.. A candle, wine, good and other presents \nIt creates a feeling of "owing" in some people.
1	Honesty.
2	ESFJ enneagram 4	Is anyone here an ESFJ enneagram 4 or know of one and would to share their experiences living as one or dealing with one? I did a bit of research on the enneagram 4 and it seems that INTJ and INTP would most likely fall under this category. It’s strange, but I’ve had friends that initially typed me as an INTJ when I am actually an ESFJ. Because of this, I wonder if it has to do with my enneagram.
3	Hi there! (: I’m an ESFJ and I’ve been typed as a 2w3 but as of five days ago, I wonder if I am actually a disintegrated 4! \n\nI was very in tune with my identity when I was younger but since starting my adult life on the wrong foot, I’ve become a bit of a people pleaser. I’ve never been someone to change who I am just to be liked. Although I do enjoy getting on with everyone. \n\nI identify with some of the tortured romanticism that goes on in the unhealthy aspects of 4s but I’m still trying to better understand it myself. What are your thoughts/experiences?
1	Hello!\n\nGrowing up, I felt socially awkward and different from all the other kids. I was envious that other kids seemed to be so at ease with their lives and everyone else and a part me wanted that for myself. The people pleasing aspect of myself came into play when I wanted to befriend these kids that I was so envious of. Ofc, through trial/error and simply growing up, I found purpose through work and school. What saved me wasn’t a “who”, but the realization that I had a purpose in this world.\n\nI found my confidence and happiness through meeting new people and experiences. Working in a restaurant and being on a team; a team of coworkers, sports or even classmates, made me realize that wasn’t so different from everyone else. \n\nFast forward to the future, I’ve left the restaurant industry, but I’m still continuing to work with people in the hospital while going to school full time to be a nurse! I guess I started life on the wrong foot until I realized that my one wrong foot wasn’t alone. It’s silly, but I was born with two feet and I’ve learned to stand on my own through the good and bad days! 
2	I (ENFP) need help with my ESFJ sister, i was hoping you guys could provide some clarity.	I love my ESFJ sister, even though we’re super different. She’s my best friend. \n\nWe’ve have long, long term issues in our relationship that cause me a lot of distress and I was hoping you guys could shed some light on what’s going on with her and how I can help make our relationship smoother. \n\nSo basically like, my sister is awesome at small talk, organizing, planning etc....When she gets stressed out or worried she lashes out at me badly. She’ll criticize everything I do in a social situation really obnoxiously, call me autistic/stupid/inept. She’ll try to control everything-then yell at me for not helping enough but I can’t read her mind! \n\nIt seems like when she needs help the most, she becomes the most hostile! \n\nMaybe it’s my auxiliary FI but even if I intellectually know that she doesn’t mean what she says, it does a number on my self esteem. Part of me will always take what she says to heart. It’s not fair that she makes me cry before a party or a holiday because she insisted on driving and then got lost. \n\nThis is the most problematic dynamic in our relationship, which is for the most part incredible! My mom is an ESFJ and also lashes out at me like this. I guess what I’m curious about from you guys is: \n\n- is lashing out at people close to you a common  ESFJ trait when under stress? \n\n-Maybe providing some insight into why this happens (for you) might help me understand where she’s coming from. I’d like a little more understanding of what’s going through \n\n-Any advice on how to communicate with her that: \n\nim willing to help and hear advice from her, she’s way better at this polite company stuff than me. \n\nIts 100% unacceptable to call me inept, a waste of space or a child either during or right before social events. It damages my self esteem, it’s not deserved at all and it’s something that will bother me for days to come. \n\nThank you guys so much for taking the time to read! Im just hoping to get inside her head a bit so I can see where she’s coming from! 
3	Hello! \nI’m an ESFJ and when you mentioned  that your sister lashes out at you under stress... I totally get that and am guilty of it myself! Maybe it’s the fact that Ti is the least used and weakest function, but whenever I’m placed in a highly stressful situation, I automatically assume the worst of everything. As a result, I become highly critical and whatever comes out my mouth has no filter. As you mentioned, your sister lashes out after trying to take the wheel and getting lost. Honestly, it seems like your sister does it with good intentions as you’ve said, but when it doesn’t turn out the way she thought it would, she becomes frustrated at herself, NOT you. You just happened to be the wrong person with her at the wrong time. \n\nThe best way to handle these situations would be to let her vent her steam, she’s probably nervous and ready to break down at this point. Pull off to the side of the road actually. At this point, ASSURE her that she’s got this and 1)help her collect her thoughts and find the right route or 2) offer to drive, but don’t come off as if you’ve been right the whole time. The point is to help her understand and process the situation, not show how incompetent she is.\n\nAfter you guys have made it safely to your destination and before entering the party, take a moment to talk to her and let her know that you’ve been hurt by her words. Let her know although you appreciate her efforts in planning, organizing and driving, that doesn’t make it alright to be lashing out at you. And finally, let your sister talk it out with you. ESFJs seem to gather their thoughts better by communicating their stressors, needs, etc. We’re a people person and the best to tackle our problems is to talk it out! \nHope this helps!!!
1	Yes! Suggesting realistic and practical solutions alleviates a lot our stress because that shows you care plus it’s one less burden we have to handle! ESFJs are known to have pretty strong emotional intelligence due to Fe being our primary function, so you probably don’t have to address her feelings as I’m sure she’s aware of them.  Just be make sure to be consistent with any advice/solution you offer because we do notice when people switch up on their words! \n\nOn a side note, I believe that words of affirmation and quality time are ranked as our number one way of receiving/showing affection so assurance along with spending time with people in our lives is a really big deal to us!
1	Hey there! Im so happy you posted this. Im INFP and my sister is ESFJ and I came to this subreddit for the same reason you posted this. My sister tends to be extremely judgmental and lash out at me in front of other people. It has caused a serious strain on our relationship. She embarrasses me and since I’m so incredibly sensitive it cuts me to the core. I don’t have any advice, just here for moral support I guess lol

5	Fe>Ni=Ne>Si>Ti>Fi>Te>Se: Am I an ESFJ?	My functions stack is Fe>Ni=Ne>Si>Ti>Fi>Te>Se. What is my MBTI type? According to 16 personalities and human metrics I am an INFJ.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n&#x200B;
1	Based on this, look up the ENFJ too. They're both similar.
2	Dating an ESFJ and loyalty	I'm currently dating an ESFJ, and I have a point of anxiety I'm dealing with.\n\nI understand that ESFJs value loyalty, but also that they love to get to know new people. A sort of social butterfly?\n\nI, being an INTJ, have no interest in meeting new people unless I hold some sort of prior interest in them. Romantically or via shared interests. I only go out partying when I'm looking for new romance or people to share a hobby.\n\nI'm wondering how likely is it that while going out and meeting new people, a female ESFJ might find themselves falling for someone other than their current SO. What is the motivation for an ESFJ to seek out new people?
5	Myer Briggs aside I think first off if you’re in a relationship you have to trust the other person! Also if you feel this way you should talk w your ESFJ bc we’re very understanding and you’re in a relationship! Does she tell you she’s going out? Does she call or text you after she’s hanging out w friends? Does she tell you about her night? I’m an ESFJ dating an introvert. I’ve explained to my bf that I get excitement from going out and meeting new people, it makes us feel good and that’s how we get our energy! the new ppl I go out to meet are other girls. For ex if I go out w gfs it’s bc I’m Social, I need girl time! I’m w my gfs meeting their gfs, I don’t go out on a mission to met other guys. I let my bf know what I’m doing and I’ll text him occasionally through the night (again I’m there w my gfs so don’t want to be in my phone the whole time) and when the night is over I’ll text or call him! I think if you’re feeling this way you should try and communicate your feelings. Is this a new relationship? Have you guys had trust issues? I’m just throwing all these out there bc a relationship to me is more than just someone’s MB :) 
5	Lifelong ESFJ here! It sounds like you’re feeling insecure about your relationship. Yes, we are social butterflies. We are easy to get along with because we show genuine interest in people. We love meeting people, deeply and superficially. I am relatively physically attractive and get hit on somewhat regularly. My personality can make men feel comfortable approaching me (men have this weird thing where they think if a woman is friendly or smiles at them, they’re interested) and because I love people I may not push them away immediately... but I am a very loyal person! I would not do anything I wouldn’t want my partner doing! I don’t flirt, I don’t go seeking romantic attention, I certainly don’t cheat... but my partners can get a little insecure because I can be seen as charming to men. When I ask them to stop and consider the type of woman I am, they know the truth is I would never run off with someone. In fact, if someone started to get too friendly, I would shut it down immediately.\n\nAll this to say, I understand your concern. It’s valid in any relationship, perhaps particularly with ESFJ. This is a struggle you might have to contend with in yourself. \n\nUltimately, if she’s a good woman and happy with you, no one can take her away. If she’s not, she can easily find someone else... but you didn’t need her anyway! Don’t worry too much and focus on your own value! You’re worth being loyal to!
3	[deleted]
2	I totally understand! If you flip it around it’s hard for us extroverts to understand why you introverts don’t want to go out and meet other ppl 🤣🙈. \n
2	But in all seriousness if you read about us in relationships and our loyalty we take our commitments very seriously and want to have a life long partner :) \n\nhttp://www.personalitypage.com/html/ESFJ_rel.html\n\nI love my bf and I would never do anything to jeopardize our relationship. I love spending time with him! He doesn’t need to go out and meet other ppl. He’s quite content with being at home, keeping w his hobbies or going out for drinks with ONE of his friends. I am too, to some extent but if I didn’t have that time to go out w my gfs and meet other girls (bars, girls night outs) I would be unhappy and depressed.  Not bc I don’t love him it’s bc I’m a social person and I need to get out make friends,talk to ppl! whereas social settings make him uncomfortable and he doesnt enjoy them! I think just keeping in mind you both need a balance esp her! You get your quality time together and she needs her space to go out w her gfs meet other girls and brag about you! :)

1	I recognize I might not get an honest answer, but the loyalty that is so strong when an ESFJ is out with friends without there partner, what if everyone is drinking? Science has proven the restraint part of the brain becomes inhibited. I guess i can see being ok with non-drinking centered activities but if it's a party i would have a lot more difficulty being so understanding
1	ESFJ are interested in new people and excitement in the same sense as a high. She will naturally spread out to interact with many people. 
2	ESFJ compatibility with ESFP?	esfp girl crushing on an esfj boy.  \n\nis it a good pairing?? \n\ndo you have any personal experience, or any valuable insight? anything and everything will be appreciated
6	As friends I find it frustrating, annoying and so different. But then a relationship might be different. As an ESFJ, I find ESFP too fluffy, not having a plan or being organised, just do whatever their heart tells them at any point without any kind of logic. They get hurt because they want to be loved even worse than ESFJs. Yeah, maybe it's just because I'm over the stories of my friend but again as I said, a relationship may be different.
3	CS Joseph on YouTube thinks it's either the single best or second best pairing out there. Look up his compatibility series if you want to know more.
2	It's called "quasi-identical" relationship by socionics. It's one of the easiest relationships to start and can be attractive and inspire crushes, but over time it turns annoying. The more you talk, the more a certain sense of irritation arises, yet it is also very easy to talk and you'll often have some common interests: [**MBTI type matches for ESFJs**](https://www.personalitycafe.com/esfj-articles/286-love-types-esfj-5.html#post2410804)
1	It's terrible. 
3	A sub for relationship advice specific to MBTI!	
3	How do you all feel about ENFP’s? Secondary Q: how do you do with long distance relationships?	I am in a weird relationship with an esfj guy. I am crazy about him and I know he likes me too. But it’s a ldr and we really only have texting for communication which doesn’t lend itself well for conveying tone. We get to see each other once a month-ish. It’s always intense but I wonder how much of that is my natural tendency to be intense and the time between seeing each other. He has said “I want to continue to see you as long as you will let me.”  Are you guys really this committed?
3	We are totally committed. I (ESFJ/f) had a long distance relationship with an ENFP (m) for 2 years and it was hard at times but it's important that you trust us, don't be too clingy but shows us that you do care and want us. It helped me to see that my partner really wanted to be with me no matter what and was happy to understand who I am. Don't treat us mean because that doesn't keep us keen but show us the possibility we have with you in the future, that you are committed and want to be closer together at some point. 
3	Are ESFJ particularly anxious?	Hello lovely people!\n\nENFP here. The three ESFJ I know are all in their teens or early 20s and they struggle a lot with anxiety.\n\nI know a lot of types struggle with anxiety (I myself have all the major symptoms and it’s very frustrating) but ESFJs seem to have a particular kind of loop, somehow their anxiety is different from mine and they struggle much more to find good coping mechanisms. \n\nI was wondering if this is an ESFJ thing, and if it is, what is your experience? Was there something that made you click and made your anxiety better? What are some good resources I can recommend to the people I love?\n\nThanks in advance!
7	I was 21 when I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. I went to counseling, which did help some, and I learned a mechanism to help me organize my priorities (and subsequently my anxiety and self worth). But honestly the life changer was medication. I take a low dose anxiety/depression pill, and looking back I truly don't know how I functioned before then.\n\nYears later, after graduating from nursing school, getting engaged and married, and moving multiple times, I tried to quit the meds, thinking that after growing up and having less stressors in my life I'd be ok without them. Unfortunately I reverted to having the crippling anxiety I'd had before the meds. I decided to go back on them because that kind of life is no kind of life- even if I have to be on meds to live THIS life. 
3	Look into the enneagram. This may have more to do with what enneagram type your friends are. I think gender also plays a huge role as well. My husband is an ESFJ, and he doesn’t have any mental health issues at all, which is weird! He is also in his 30s so I bet that helps too. But hopefully looking into the enneagram can help you and your loved ones! Best of luck 
2	I'm shy and anxious. Best thing to do is throw yourself out there and fight the wolves. Better to be brave even when you dont want to then to die a coward. - Male ESFJ aka pussy asss bitch lmao.
1	I don't have anxiety, ESFJ mid twenties female. I struggled with being shy when I was young or low confidence but not anxiety. 
5	is an ESFJ compatible with an ISFj?	well what the title says but i wanna learn the flaws\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(i did something wrong in my old post srry so i deleted it and made a new one)
5	I'm an ISFJ, been with an ESFJ for 2 years now.\n\nI'm extremely happy with him, I think we're super compatible. He's very emotionally healthy, so other people may have different experiences depending on their partner.\n\n\nHes very good at communicating, and he pulls me out of my shell a lot. \nI'm not naturally verbally expressive, but he is, so it helped me to develop that more in myself. Any conflict is settled with a short, polite conversation, he's extremely kind and considerate of my feelings. He's a super easygoing person, and it's rare for him to get upset over anything.\n\n\nHe's super affectionate and caring, he's always trying to take care of me, and making sure I'm fed, warm, comfortable and generally content. \nIt's a nice change for me, as I'm usually trying to take care of everyone else and sometimes put myself on the back burner. \n\n\nI love seeing him in group settings, he brings out the best in people and everyone seems to love him. He's introduced me to a lot of people, and while he still respects my need for quiet time to be an introvert by myself, he's also been really good at pushing me out of my comfort zone just a little bit, and I always have a ton of fun tagging along with him for social events.\n\n\nHe's incredibly encouraging and supportive of me, whatever the circumstances. He's been here for me through some rough life changes, health problems, anxiety, unemployment, etc. He's been an unwavering support system whenever I've needed him, and we make a really good team. \n\n\nI honestly can't think of any real problems we have, apart from the fact that neither of us likes to be in charge of making decisions.\nChoosing where to eat, what movie to watch, what activity to do that day, etc. \nWe have to force each other to take turns choosing, because I think we both tend to be more submissive in that area of our lives, and prefer someone else to make the decision.\n\n\nOtherwise, it's awesome. It's the best relationship I've ever had, and I wouldn't change anything about him.\nI love how kind he is, he makes me laugh like crazy, and I feel like we understand each other. \nWe're super compatible, and our whole relationship has been very easy.
4	Married an ESFJ. She tends to overbook a lot of what I would like to be downtime but is starting to understand this now. They bottle up thoughts just as much as we do. Don’t let that happen. Makes for a better relationship. I’ll come back to this. Gotta run.
2	ESFJ Cognitive functions and four sides of the mind EXPLAINED	
2	Ah, good ole CSJ, i found his videos to be a bit meaty, but his recent typing videos are pretty dope.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nfairly thorough analysis of Fe, i wish he could be a bit more concise, but nonetheless, dope vid.
3	Hello !	I've seen a few folks talk about music here and I have seen this as a common topic across many MBTI subreddits. So I made a subreddit -> https://www.reddit.com/r/MBTIRadioStation/ <- to see if others are interested in having more conversations on these two topics.\n\nI envy you ESFJs. You are talented in ways I can't even dream of being. Take [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HnLRrQ3RS4) guy for example. \n\nSure there are terrible examples ... but also awesome ones. Here's few of my favorites\n\n1. [Blue - One love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFGPSx6cPN0)\n2. [Hoobastank - The Reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV4DiAyExN0)\n3. [Justin Timberlake - Rock Your Body](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSVHoHyErBQ)\n4. [Dua Lipa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2qgadSvNyU)\n\nWhat can I say Hot ! Hot !\n\nI think each type is instinctively drawn to listen to its own type's music but I could be wrong. Feel free to post tunes here -> https://www.reddit.com/r/MBTIRadioStation/ <- 
8	INTJ's and ESFJ's are the Most Common Marriage Pairing (Apparently.)	I am a big MBTI nerd (INTJ, what can you expect?) and apparently we are incredibly compatible with all of you ESFJs. My source comes from [CS Jospeh and his series on social compatibility](https://youtu.be/DLPQOoASnec).  \n\n\nThing is, where do ESFJs go for fun? INTJs don't really go out and I've been trying to match with an ESFJ via online dating... it's not going well. :/  \n\n\n&#x200B;
15	Hmm I disagree. I think ESFJs are the worst match for INTJs. INTJs go well with ENFP or ENTP. ESFJs have Fe, which is your polr function in socionics, and will drive you up the wall. INTJ/ESFJ are conflicting relationships in socionics, each knowing how to hurt the other to the max. 
4	This is me and my husband!! We make it work. In a lot of ways we push each other to overcome our weaker areas - he helps me imagine scenarios beyond what I can see (his N vs my S), I remind him to connect with his family (my E vs his I). We explain ourselves and forgive a lot
3	27/M/INTJ been with my 28/F/ESFJ SO for 8years, getting married soon. 
2	I'm not too into Meyers Briggs anymore, but I don't know if I could get along with someone so opposite of me, for life.  My husband is an ISFJ and we drive each other bonkers, but I think that's normal in any relationship.    
1	[deleted]
1	I'm INTJ and my wife is ESFJ. We will be celebrating our 40th Wedding Anniversary this year and I will take as many more anniversaries as I can get.  We work hard at our marriage because we both want to make it work.  All of the previously discussed annoyances have happened and continue to happen in our marriage, but the positives of the relationship are incredible.  There are aspects of our marriage in which there will never be a meeting of the minds - we've be down that "solution" road already and from my point of view there will never be a resolution to my satisfaction but I've moved on because having "us" is worth it.  Maybe a different kind of personality matchup would have been an easier relationship for me, but I wasn't looking for easy; I was looking for someone to bring things to my life that I could not do for myself.  She was exactly who I was looking for and waited for and it's been worth it.
3	MBTI & Music Survey (Redesign) - Need respondents!	 \n\nI created an initial version of this survey a few days ago, but after receiving feedback and reviewing many of the responses, I restructured it to increase accuracy, depth, and easier data analysis. Even if you've already taken the previously posted survey, please take this new one as well.\n\nThis is a survey searching for correlation between MBTI and musical interests such as genres, instruments, singing, dance, and composition/production. Once I get a descent amount of responses, I will post the results in [r/mbti](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti) (unless [r/esfj](https://www.reddit.com/r/estj) would like me to post them here as well). I've created individual surveys for each of the 16 personality types, and the one below is SPECIFICALLY for ESFJs.\n\nThe ESFJ survey link:\n\n[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JRDPRTN](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JRDPRTN) \n\n​\n\nIf you are not an ESFJ please find the correct link for your type here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9a6hbw/mbti\_music\_survey\_redesign\_need\_respondents/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9a6hbw/mbti_music_survey_redesign_need_respondents/)\n\n​\n\nThanks for your responses! As I said previously, I will post the results and analysis in [r/mbti](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti) once the survey is completed.
5	INTP’s and ESFJ’s	Hello, fellow INTPs, would you say that ESFJs are your rivals. I’m just curious why there are a lot of INTP invaders here.
8	All us INTPs like ESFJs but don’t understand them.  *shrugs
6	I married and ESFJ and it's absolutely exhausting for both of us.\n\nShe whines and nags about me not being emotional enough and I grit my teeth in silence as she goes on yet another emotional tantrum/rant about literally anything and everything.\n\nWe cannot have deep conversations because I come at it from logic, facts and open-mindedness and she comes at it from feelings and a sense of moral high-ground and neither of us literally give a flying f\*\*\* about those things, respectively.\n\nOpposites do attract though.\n\nWe admire our hero and parent functions. I admire that she's so comfortable around people and can make friends with anyone and she admires that I can solve literally anything and can see through obstacles. I admire her hard work ethic and dedication and she admires that I can stay so calm and collected all the time, even in crisis.\n\nIt's a cluster-fuck to say the least and it's extremely difficult to manage but more so lately. But when we're both chilled out and laid-back, being lazy, it's a joy to be together. All in all, possibly the worst match I can imagine for a deep relationship. I'd say ESFJs are fucking amazing friends though.
2	the dating site says I like ESFJ...so I looked it up and it doesn't sound anything like the women I've been dating *shrug*\n\n-INTP
1	Tbh I'd say if anything, your "rivals" are INFPs. Not that I don't like you guys (it's dumb to dislike someone based on type) but I sure don't understand you 
1	I have a close friend who is INTP and he is definitely my rival!!! I joke with him of how he is my mortal enemy and archnemesis, but it is just my endearment to him. But we are definitely rivals!!! It's like we are the same but reversed!!! I am actually ExFJ but I think when it comes to cognitive functions, it explains why we are that way, because our cognitive functions are the same, but reversed (ESFJ and INTP). I think we can never understand each other. I'm not sure with him, but I still appreciate him even though I cannot comprehend him (He is a mystery to me)!
1	Ok, INTP here. How in the world does everyone know everyone else’s personality type. How do people learn such information about other people?
1	I lurk all the subs here and then except for the Gamma quadra. 
1	Hmmm...it would be challenging. Run...\n
1	I'm here because I'm typing people that I know, and I got to my step-dad, who I like to refer to as The Step-Dictator®. He is my sworn enemy and I wanted to know if I would hate all ESFJs or if it's just him.\n
2	What does your favorites/bookmarks bar look like? (I'm INTP)	 Mine; just to name a few:\n\n\-Sir Issac newton vs. Bill Nye (epic rap battles)\n\n\-Are humans OP? (teir Zoo)\n\n\-Books: "what is this thing called science?"\n\nand "an introduction to the philosophy of science"\n\n\-Ifunny(meme app)\n\n\- [Technocrat's Critiques of the Capitalist Economy - Artificial Scarcity and Imperialism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uOOb6Wqlh4)(politics)\n\n\-"the living wake"(free indie movie on on youtube, about existentialism.)\n\n\-Lemongrab "UNACCEPTIABLE" in 18 languages.\n\n\-Crunchyroll: Watch Free Anime & Mange Online\n\n​\n\nYour list doesn't have to as extensive.
3	I don't use bookmarks at all. I just type in the website and it autocompletes. I feel like that's faster than using the bookmarks anyway
2	Mine mainly consist of:\n\nold movies and anime I plan to watch\n\nbooks I plan to read\n\nobscure online stores that I could never remember the names of\n\nand various MBTI/Enneagram related websites
1	Mine are full of folders so I can organize the sites I want to save. I am between my laptop and my phone so it helps!
4	ESFJs and friends, could you please take my MBTI Romantic Relationship Survey?	[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2QSNJPP](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2QSNJPP)\n\nI don't have any ESFJ samples :(\n\nIf you know your and your current or ex partner's mbti, please fill out as many times as you've had partners!\n\nIt's simple and I would love to expand on it in the future but these are all the variables I need to complete my Multivariate Statistics Analysis class.\n\nThank you!
3	Wooow this is so interesting and I want to take it and know the results! :D too bad I have never been in a relationship haha :))
3	Took it! I would love to know the results as well.
1	ESFJ here with an ESTJ. Four years down the line, best relationship ever! 
6	NOTES ON MY INFJ (M) x ESFJ (F) RELATIONSHIP	I have had five and a half years with a beautiful soul. We have lived together for three of those so we are well into the part of the relationship we can't hide our true selves from each other anymore. I figure we are currently in a funk because we both have not matured, specifically, in regard to our types. \n\nI've reseached ESFJ's. They always need to know that you want/desire them. If an ESFJ doesn't get this constant recognition/appreciation then she gets worried that you no longer want them around and of for a while I have felt she has been loyal to somebody else. I  am not her naturally compatible type so she is "cheating" on me, please note; not in the literal sense of the word because I crave DIE HARD loyalty. She is getting her needs met by a friend (F) who's type probably compliments hers.\n\nI remember in the beginning thinking how lucky I was because she was so low maintenance. Well apparently not. I figure everyone quicky discovers in relationships so nothing new there. This could be [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) but I have noticed that\n\n* She never knows what she wants. \n* Because of **Ne**, ESFJ's take the value judgements of those that influence them but they are also easily sold or taken advantage of so you can imagine the result if you are in the wrong circle. \n\nThese two (actually three) elements are the fuel to my fear of our future together.\n\nThe INFJ **Te** blindspot demands I am not aware of what others are thinking and this is a terrible thing when she does not communicate. I fully understand that I should ignore the self harming thoughts running around in my head during such episodes.\n\nI bet no ESFJ would want to be told what I've written above, especially by an INFJ in person, because when it's truth time I always come off as commanding which I avoid in fear of pushing people away. I am a perfectionist with terribly high standards that I don't adhere to half of the time and I am struggling to grasp that **everyone isn't like me**. But I am trying to improve myself every (other) day, something I never see in my ESFJ. Will a divide grow between us or is maturity a naturally occuring process? Only time will tell.\n\nPS: Everything I have written above is attached to personal experiences.
4	I really hope you guys work things out. \n\nI'm a female ESFJ and all my boyfriends have been INFJ.. I have a little theory that the INFJ and ESFJ are actually the best match.\n\nAlthough a lot of what you said is true.. maybe my theory will help you feel confident in your relationship.\n\nINFJ typically are known for being a very deep type who are misunderstood, and take a while to get to know, but once they fully trust someone they stick by them (sometimes to an unhealthy degree). Now, ESFJ, although we appear open and warm, we usually have a hidden intelligence from our Ti.\n\nWe're actually self conscious of it and only share it with people we're very comfortable with. So with that allows time for the ESFJ and INFJ to warm up to each other and get to know the hidden intelligence they both have. \n\nMeanwhile.. the ESFJ often have issues with letting people in-in fear they will leave.. and INFJ stick with people often to a fault, remember?.. so they become an attached pair.\n\n\-They both share Fe, and all of their other functions (Ne, Ni, Se, Si) don't typically cause conflict- actually they add interest.. (Example: Ni being the INFJ dominant function, and Ne being our 3rd.. allows our Ne to be presant but not strong enough to conflict.. Giving us an ability to see eye to eye better.) \n\nWell.. I hope this helped in some way, and that you guys can work things out! 
2	Esfj are simple yet complicated people. If she feels not appreciated she would act as if she is fine. Passive aggressive. Challenging match. 
1	Wow. This very accurately describes my last relationship, now ended. I’m INFJ and my ex is ESFJ. There was an initial very strong chemistry.  The problems lay with both of us and I could copy and paste the above comments which elucidate the problems.   I understand that my ex ESFJ is still very frustratedly angry with me for ending the relationship, which is ironic and sad as it was the repeated frustrated anger when things didn’t go perfectly that soured my view in the first place.  I would say my ESFJ was a very anxious attacher, where as I was more a distant attacher.  ESFJ seemed to need constant reassurance that we were attached and this seemed to be a HUGE vulnerability. Whereas I would confidently say that I could very easily maintain a loyal and devoted attachment with someone even if they lived on the other side of the planet.  ESFJ wanted engagement and marriage super fast (wanted to be engaged within a few months) where as I would be very happy with that sort of formality to evolve after several years of devotion and loyalty.  Not sure if that is relatable, but those are my insights from what transpired. Happy to delve further if required. \nIn summary: I feel my ex-ESFJ just wanted to be loved in a very secure way, unconditionally.  Whereas I, an INFJ, just wanted to be understood, respected and trusted, unconditionally, without any of the drama.

3	Music and personality data gathering (5 minute survey)	Hello all, if you are interested, I created a survey regarding Mbti type and music preferences. It's just for fun, but I am curious to see the results. I personally don't expect to see a huge difference between types, but who knows! It'll only take a few minutes, so please check it out.\n\nI will be posting results after all the data has been compiled.\nhttps://goo.gl/forms/wgMY0z9LvWmN0NY23\n\n***Edit: I will be closing the test to do data stuff at 2pm CT on Sunday, August 5. Sorry if you didn't get it a chance to take the test. Look for the results post in a day or two.***
1	I tend to love all genres across the board. However, what normally bothers me the most musically is yelling or screaming. I haven’t been able to appreciate edm yet either. I tend to find myself loving chill, relaxed, calmer music across all genres. I love songs that make me feel sentimental.
3	INFP in need of an ESFJ friend.	Hello \n\n So i quit my job and I'm ready to tackle the whole 'working for yourself'. I'm really good at making plans , except those plans are constantly reworked every minute of the day. \nI've learnt early on that Im not a natural self starter when it comes to tackling down tasks. I did notice that when friends tell me to get  on with it , I actually do. \n\nSo since I'm starting a new chapter , and I know what I know thought I'd ask . \n\nI can create my schedule and what I want to achieve daily or weekly basis , think where you'd come in handy is kind of checking on me couple of minutes , daily or every other day. You know some positive vibes and some orders. \n\nEdit: M25London

2	Legitimacy of "Myers-briggs?" (i'm Highly Sensitive and ESFJt) ???	I'm beginning to to question the myers-brigg test and it looks very tenuous at best to indicate whether a person is who they are?\n\nCan a persons personality results change?\n\nWhat are the accuracy levels to myers-briggs?\n\nCan someone add some insight into this?\n\nI'm doing some self-discovery and find out that i'm also a 'Highly-sensitiveness person?'\n\nMaybe you see yourself here too?\n\n[link\n](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/communication-success/201711/24-signs-highly-sensitive-person)\n\nALSO the validity of Myers-brigs test\n[Link](https://www.vox.com/2014/7/15/5881947/myers-briggs-personality-test-meaningless)\n\nI think Dr. Oldhams 14 personality types is better insight than myers-brigs.\n\nThoughts / comments?\n\n
1	Yeah, totally legit. If you really want to get into it, Reckful wrote an extensive post a while ago on Personality Cafe, debunking all the common criticisms against MBTI. He’s a long-time poster who’s more into the dichotomies than the functions, but whatevs. Don’t ask me what that means, cos I dont know, lol.\n\nhttps://www.personalitycafe.com/myers-briggs-forum/283457-another-mbti-debunking.html#/topics/283457?page=1
1	> Can a persons personality results change?\n\nYES\n\nConstantly, hormones play a huge role in your current personality. Stress and circumstances also can change your personality. 
1	What's Dr. Oldhams 14 personality types? Can you give me please a link with this theory? I don't know it at all. 
1	MBTI is pretty innacurate and shallow. Fun, and can give you a general idea (assuming it got it right, which it often doesn't), but if you really want to understand yourself and others, you need to dive into Cognitive Functions. But first, here's this;  \n[http://cognitivetype.com/2018/05/06/why-mbti-mistypes-everyone/](http://cognitivetype.com/2018/05/06/why-mbti-mistypes-everyone/)  \nIn summary, MBTI tests are looking for an "A or B" answer to each of the four letters. But each of those questions is loaded, and also extremely subjective. And it does nothing to address the cognitive functions, which are also well explained on the above website.  \nFurthermore, there are actually four sides to the mind you could say: The Ego (Conscious), The Shadow (Unconscious), The Subconscious, and The Super Ego. Depending on your maturity level, as well as your behavior under stress and your confidence, people often test on MBTI aspects of their subconscious or unconscious, further confounding the results. All of the above is why people can often take the MBTI tests and wind up with different results over time, or even taken back to back.  \n\n\nIn short, you have four functions of which can be introverted or extroverted, making eight total. Everyone has all eight cognitive functions, but four are in your ego/conscious, while four are in your shadow/unconscious. The order of your MBTI letters can completely screw with your cognitive function stack, and the stack is what you actually care about.  \nFor example, if you can't decide between ESFJ and ESFP, you might think "what's the difference between J/P? It's not much" but that is incorrect.  \nESFJ:  (ego) Fe - Si - Ne - Ti / (shadow) Fi - Se - Ni - Te  \nESFP: (ego) Se - Fi - Te - Ni / (shadow) Si - Fe - Ti - Ne  \nThe order of the functions determines strength, preference, and how the function manifests in it's "role" in your psyche. So not only do these two personality types operate on different functions entirely, they also operate with different strengths and such. These two personalities, seemingly similar on MBTI, are miles apart in the real world.  \n\n\nI could go on and on and on (I love this stuff), but I'll stop there for now. I can elaborate if you want, I'm happy to talk more about it or answer questions.  \nIf you'd be interested to learn more on your own, my favorite youtuber is C.S. Joseph, he does a fantastic job, including explaining the problems with MBTI, what the functions mean, what each type looks like, their interactions, and so on.  \nThe version of personality typing I'm referring to here is called Jungian Analytical Psychology, or Cognitive Typing (these are similar and parallel, just slightly separate). Many of these schools of thought originated from the works of Carl Jung, including MBTI, but MBTI is sadly very limited in its approach.  \n\n\nCheers.

1	can u hurry up and post this on every sub so i stop seeing it
2	I can't communicate with my ESFJ anymore. Facts are disregarded for feelings. Help.	Please help, this is super important to me :(\n\nI have an ESFJ in my life, someone I care for deeply but as an ISTP my mode of operation is analysis and facts based.\n\nIf something is wrong, I want you to tell me with proof so that I can grow. My ESFJ is all about feeling and group think, she disregards proof, facts, analysis and even what is right in-front of her in favor of her feelings.I take huge issue with this because feelings are subjective, your feelings can be wrong and when presented with documented proof, how can you disregard that in favor of "It feels wrong" and then justify it with "These guys also say it feels wrong so I'm right.". It baffles me. I understand that criticism and growing is very difficult for an ESFJ and it's even more difficult when challenging peoples beliefs and making them grow is my fucking love language :P\n\nI have a friend whom I dearly love and he challenges my beliefs ALL THE TIME and I LOVE him for it. I feel like I grow every time we speak. But I really don't know how to communicate with my ESFJ who I can see is hurting herself and making her life much more difficult than it should be and it's seriously affecting her, but when I try to tell her she's gets furious and extremely hurt. I don't get it. Why wouldn't you want to improve your life based on documented truths in favor of subject emotional delusions...\n\nYou're clearly upset, why hold so tightly to what is clearly upsetting you... even when presented with facts.
2	I understand that challenging a person's beliefs may be an ISTP's love language, but this may come across to feelers as purposely hurting them and challenging the whole person. I know it must not be taken personally, but feelers really tend to see it that way because we see our values and beliefs as part of who we are, so it may come across in a different way for the person. Rejecting our values, principles, beliefs, may be rejecting us as people, too. I have an ENFP friend in a relationship with an ISTP and this is almost always the root of their misunderstandings. Maybe you can just explain it in a nice way? You need to meet halfway. Perhaps you can explain your side in a way that will not hurt her feelings, and she needs to listen to what you have to say, too, with an open and understanding heart.

2	ESFJ-t	Hi Friends,\n\nI just took a myers-briggs test which indicated that i am ESFJ-t. \n\nI took the test at 16personalities.com\n\nI know this means, my personality is inclined toward\nExtrovert, Sensing, Feeling, Judgement \n**but 'what does the T' Stand for?**\n\nALSO, does anyone know of a site that can explain what each personality trait means in detail?\n\nThanks very much!
3	The T stands for "Turbulent." It's based on how you handle stress. Turbulent people don't handle stress as well as A or Assertives. (I'm about 99% sure on that)\n\nAnd I don't have any speciffic website for you other than the one you already took the test on. But I can assure you that after a while, all the different letters start making sense. Just remember there's oposited for each. \n\nExtrovert-Introvert\n\nSensing-iNtuitive\n\nFeeling-Thinking\n\nJudging-Perceiving\n\nAnd not all of those mean exactly what you may think they do. So a quick search like "What does Judging in Meyer's Briggs mean?" Will provide lots of interesting info for you. 
2	You might want to try looking into the cognitive functions. i personally find 16personalities to be a bit unreliable, since they use the dichotomies (i.e. scales for e/i, s/n, etc.) to type people, which can skew the results based on your mood or feeling (note: i'm not trying to say that you aren't an ESFJ, but just letting you know that you could possibly be mistyped). Two other popular tests that I'd find to be pretty accurate (and some others in the mbti community) are [here](http://similarminds.com/classic_jung.html) and [here](http://www.keys2cognition.com/explore.htm). (The first test's about 60 questions long, the second one's around 50)\n\nI'll leave a few other links below in case if you want to dig a bit deeper:\n\n[https://www.typeinmind.com/](https://www.typeinmind.com/)\n\n[http://cognitiveprocesses.com/](http://cognitiveprocesses.com/)\n\n[https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2018/02/23/introduction-cognitive-functions-myers-briggs-theory/](https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2018/02/23/introduction-cognitive-functions-myers-briggs-theory/)\n\n[https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/if-youre-confused-about-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-read-this-an-intro-to-cognitive-functions/](https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/if-youre-confused-about-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-read-this-an-intro-to-cognitive-functions/)\n\nOther than that, welcome to the mbti community!! have fun & hope you enjoy your stay ;D\n\n\~a friendly infp
1	The -T/A thing [16personalities.com](https://16personalities.com) does is pretty much a gimmick they use to get people to buy their information. It isn't standard MBTI.\n\nAlso, if you are into personality stuff checkout the Big 5 traits. That might give you a better idea of how you tend to deal with stress.
3	Love and loyalty	So I thought there was something going on between me (INFP) and an ESFJ. Anyway, it lead me to a question about your personality.\n\nDo you often notice a contradiction between your feelings and your decisions?\n\nSuppose that you find yourself in a situation where you fall in love with someone else while already in a relationship? Would you choose to go with your feelings or loyalty?\n\n\nThank you :)\n
2	Loyalty but if I had real feelings and I am unhappy in the relationship then I would follow my feelings however it would take a while as I would live in denial and clutch onto the current relationship. 
2	For a committed relationship, loyalty every time but that’s still based on feelings including prioritizing the lifelong feelings of regret I know I would have if I acted disloyally over a new feeling that’s likely transitory.
1	ESFJ here. I find that people often think they are closer to me than they really are or maybe misinterpret the relationship. ESFJs are normally very warm people and are good at connecting with people. I know that there were multiple women prior to my getting married that thought I liked them, but from my perspective they were just good friends and I was just being my friendly warm ESFJ self. It hasn't been as much of an issue since getting married, since people know I'm married and there's less chance of misinterpretation. 
1	Loyalty. I actually think that I'm a kind of person who will stay in the relationship even if I'm unhappy, rather than hurting the other person. I will do my best to work the relationship out. And I will never forget of course the bond that I have formed with my partner for so long and still work in strenghteming. I think exceptions would be an abusive relationship and cheating. These are dealbreakers for me. Although I guess having feelings for someone else is very very very unlikely for me because I am very loyal, and I know the difference between love (which is longlasting, deep, intense) with infatuation (which is fleeting, shallow, not true love).

2	Is it normal for ENTPs to mis-type themselves as ESFJ-A?	
2	MBTI isn't particularly accurate, for a number of reasons. Here's a quick and interesting read on the matter.  \n[http://cognitivetype.com/2018/05/06/why-mbti-mistypes-everyone/](http://cognitivetype.com/2018/05/06/why-mbti-mistypes-everyone/)  \n\n\nIf you really want to understand yourself and others, you have to understand the cognitive functions. There are Eight in total (T/F and S/N, but either with either an introverted or extroverted charge). There are four sides to the mind, but for now I'll mention two. The Ego (Conscious) holds the four cognitive functions that a person most prefers and uses, and is generally where an individual resides, most of the time. The Shadow (Unconscious) holds the remaining four cognitive functions, which are reluctantly used and less often, but they are important at times and integrating the Shadow into part of your psyche is the path to maturity, to make yourself whole (with all eight functions in balance). ESFJ and ENTP are fairly similar as it so happens:  \nESFJ: ego Fe - Si - Ne - Ti |shadow Fi - Se - Ni - Te  \nENTP: ego Ne - Ti - Fe - Si | shadow Ni - Te - Fi - Se  \nSo they share the same functions within the ego, creating similar traits. But the order greatly affects strength of functions, preference, and "role" (how they manifest).  \nIf you want to know more on the topic, I could explain it. But if you're up for more learning, check out youtuber C.S. Joseph, his work is fantastic and he breaks it down beautifully.  \n\n\nIf you just want a quick glimpse of a difference between the two types, without too much background, it's something like this... (context can be found in C.S. Joseph's lectures) both types share the same interaction style of "Starters", which are;   \n\-Informative (explain in more detail, context always matters. opposite of Direct)  \n\-Initiating (mark of an extroverted type, initiates experience/interactions. opposite of Responding)  \n\-Movement (makes progress in/despite chaos, prefers novelty and frequent change/variables. opposite of Control)  \nSo the difference comes down to the Temperament;  \n\-Guardian (SJ): aka 'Past Protectors' are all about the past, duty/tradition, protecting loved ones (via past knowledge), are more interested relationships etc  \n\-Intellectual (NT): aka 'Future Thinkers' prefer to think somewhat abstractly, form their own conclusions, are more interested in ideas/concepts/mechanics etc  \n\n\nFrom your little descriptions, your Friend 1 sounds more ENTP, Friend 2 sounds like an ESFJ. Don't let the MBTI "48:52" ratios fool you, MBTI doesn't take into account cognitive functions, is horribly subjective, and uses loaded/leading dichotomies (as explained in the link above). Your friend isn't "48% ENTP 52% ESFJ" or anything to that effect, it's just difficult to type people when your tools aren't very sharp. :)  \n\n\nHope that helps, happy to answer questions. Cheers.
2	As an ENTP I could never imagine that I was a ESFJ of any sort.\n\n
1	I'm not sure how accurate this personality test is. \n\nI would check out the personality self-portrait for more on personality styles. \n\nptypes.com
3	How Does It Make You Feel When A Former Close Friend No Longer Wants You In Their Life?	How does this make you feel? Do you get over it quickly, after a few months? Does it linger in the back of your head for awhile and bother you when you think about it? Does it crush you and you feel helpless?
5	Yes, I would feel really really bad and sad. I never want to cut ties with anyone, most especially if I love the person so much. I will do my best to make up with the person. However, if the person has already made the decision and it's final, I can do nothing about it, and just hope that the person will be happy in the future. I will try to move on with all the good memories, but without the person in my life already. I do not like it, but it has been the choice of the person, so I can only respect that and move on. It would torture me for so long though, blaming myself,  before finally being able to move on. It would however be a lifetime scar for me, bringing out all my insecurities and doubs within myself.
4	ESFJ who can't take a hint and talks nonstop despite no answer?	Literally talks and talks and talks and talks to no end with no idea that we're getting bored an exhausted of listening despite one-word responses and grunts... too sensitive to just be like "dude please stop talking". She always looks like someone's about to punch her and is more concerned about being everyone's friend than about what is actually good for them... tells the same stories over and over in the exact same way and will just talk at you and trap you even if you're hardly responding or not responding at all. Seems to feel the need to tell people every single detail her brain can possibly rack up and makes that shitty face so nobody gets the cojones to ask her to be excused.  \n\nHow on earth do I deal with this person who won't stop talking? I even had a conversation with her telling her, "hey, I get pretty exhausted from talking quickly so I just wanted to let you know because I don't know how to tell you". She just defended herself the whole time saying, "sometimes I get carried away". You think I don't know??? At this point people avoid her just to keep from getting trapped. Is there any way to go about this or am I just going to have to deal with it forever? I'm stuck being around her most of the time so it's not like I can just leave. 
2	Sounds like insecurity. ESFJs tend to have trouble with introspection. Try using your Fe and get deep into her (gross dude...). Do this: https://www.wikihow.com/Practice-Compassion-Meditation Be her "introspection guru". Notice her function usage and try to see the reasons behind it. It's like Ne psychoanalysis. Then, take the function she's using into account, her type into account, and work from there.\n\nA lot of people in society need therapists, and they don't know it. This is one of the reasons we see people like that. You may not legally be qualified to be her therapist, but there are things you can do to help.\n\nI'm an INTP who has grown up with a narc and had a low EQ. It warped my sense of self and sense of the world around me. Eventually, I stopped believing anything my parents said. Neither knew what they were talking about, and my mom just tried manipulating. This is why I was so awkward and sucked at socializing. The low EQ caused emotions to seep out in various ways. I'd talk a ton and make way too many jokes, because I wanted attention and validation which I was deprived of.\n\nPerhaps this ESFJ is experiencing something similar.
1	I think ESFJs have a hard time taking a hint. I don't know with other ESFJs but I appreciate honest and straightforward people. I prefer them being straight to the point with their feelings because it is harder for me to read their true feelings. I appreciate that because it shows that people still want to compromise with me and still make it work somehow with me, by stating the things that I do that they do not like. So that we can make it work in the future. However, I have already trained myself for this. Others may be too sensitive, depending on the person. Maybe you can tell the person in a more straightforward but nice way. We really have a hard time picking up hints, so I do not recommend that.
1	> She just defended herself the whole time saying, "sometimes I get carried away". You think I don't know??? \n\nloool\n\nDoesn't sound like an healthy person. These are the people that scare the shit out of me, an adult ESFJ I know is nearly like that and, man, she wants you to **feel** her anxiety... Even if you're clearly uncomfortable, she'll keep pushing until she's got it all out.\n\nSet boundaries, be clear, offer a compromise. You don't have to be uncomfortable with her, it's not good to neither of you. Assert yourself, remind her that you already told her that you get uncomfortable: "sometimes" she gets carried away, "sometimes" you get exhausted (regardless of who is speaking, it's the format itself). I'd suggest not to just dismiss her, to rather involve her so she can make a choice and have a chance to improve her behavior. Don't be manipulative, don't be ambiguous, don't be rude. My 2 cents.
6	What Do ESFJs Think/Feel about INFJs?	What are your thoughts/feels about INFJs ?? Just wondering :)
4	Personally, I really really love and am fond of INFJs!!! My first love, my bestfriend, and many more close friends are INFJs!!! :D They are very complex and mysterious, but I love that about them. Their presence is also very comforting. They are very caring amd sensitive, to the point that they forget their own well-being. For me, I think they are great mindreaders!!! They always know how I truly feel without me having to say it, which I appreciate a lot! :)
5	My sister (ESFJ) has answered for you. "They make me curious." In other words, one of the few types ESFJs cannot pick up on immediately. 
1	How do you react to someone you care about never wanting to speak to you again?	lets say you were once really close to a person of the opposite gender ( like bff close) and they had feelings for you but you simply didnt reciprocate those feelings, so they were hurt and distanced themselves from you (deleted you from social media, never text you anymore). They hold a grudge against you for not reciprocating those feelings and you feel as if they hate you or have a strong disliking because you rejected them. How would that make you feel? How would you view that person who pushed you away?
3	They stopped talking to you not because they hate you for rejecting them. They did it to save themselves from shame. You feel like someone hates you when they don’t talk to you anymore because you are very tuned to other people’s emotions and it had often been the case in the past. But in this case, I can tell you that this person stopped communicating because interacting with you made them feel ashamed for being rejected. They certainly did not stop communicating deliberately to make you feel bad. \n\nAs to what to do, just communicate your feelings. If they blocked you everywhere, write a letter to their place. Tell them you want to stay as good friends and you didn’t mean to make them feel ashamed. That you have your life and have to make your choices sometimes. That’s all you can do. \n\nPersonally I feel like this person is immature. A mature person will not end a good friendship just because their advance was rejected. But that is for you to find out. I do not know neither you nor that person. My judgement is irrelevant. 
3	I would feel really really sad and that a good friendship is wasted. I do not mind if the person needs space first to move on. I will understand that and give the person space and time. However, if the person wants to cut ties with me permanently, I would feel that maybe we do not have that strong of a friendship for this to happen just like that.
2	How do ESFJs deal with people?	I'm an INTP. Trying to figure out how to use my Extroverted Feeling function. Tell me how you all like to handle people!
11	Handle people? We want to be liked and want those around us to feel listened to and cared for. We are/I am warm and perhaps too quick to please others. I always “want” to do what others want to do. I genuinely cannot think of preferences when asked. If someone else has one, I’d rather go along with theirs so they are happy because I will be satisfied anyway. I have a long history/problem with caring for others more than myself. I am very generous. What I have, I will give away or at least share 50/50 without regard for if it’s appreciated, respected, or if I might be taken advantage of. I think this is a characteristic of ESFJ. Personally, I have a lot of tastes and cannot be pinned to one thing. I am easy to please and entertain. The extrovert in me is bubbly and will speak to anyone. That doesn’t mean I like small talk. I don’t. I desire deep connections with people... because there is nothing more that I love than people. I briefly dated an INTP and we had very different expectations in the relationship. It was too much to handle. He was a giver upper. I’m a fighter. He was way too casual for my taste. ESFJ can be a little more traditional, to my understanding. I know I am. I need to be asked out on proper dates and have doors held and sweet comments i  the beginning of a relationship. He didn’t feel the need. We liked each other: that’s all there was to it for him. I kind of went on a tangent here... but I hope this helped a little!
2	I think we just want everyone to be happy!!! :D most espcially our loved ones!!! :) So we will do all that we can just for them to be happy! :)
5	ESFJs, it is true that types change into you when they become a mom?	I've read somewhere in a forum that you become an ESFJ when you become a mom.\n\n  \n\[Don't take it seriously, it's a joke.\]
2	Can confirm. 
2	I mean, how would I know, already being an ESFJ? That being said, makes total sense. I am the mom friend. I just want everyone to be happy and feel included and cared about. Also, we need to schedule some free time together.
2	My yawn was interrupted with a small laugh, your title made my night ;) 
1	I've been likened to a mom my whole life!! Too bad I've never had any. 
1	It certainly helps to be an ESFJ as a mom.\n\nSource: I have twin 5 month olds 
1	Until you female ESFJ hit menopause and the kids move off.\n\nIf other parts of their life have not helped her create a separate identity away from motherhood... Whew.. It's a hot mess...
3	ESFJ joy	
6	Burning Love for Everybody?	I was looking at an "ESFJ Brain" diagram in Google Images, and one of the sections said "burning love for everybody." Could you explain that in detail? ESFJ's have a burning love for everybody? How does that work?
2	I'm not that sure about it as well but when I think about it, I looooooove people!!!! All people!!! I often just look at a person, and no matter what random thing that person is doing (eating, laughing, talking, etc.), I often just think about and feel how much I love that person!!! I have a special place in my heart for my loved ones who are special to me, but I think I love strangers, too. I think I was born to love and serve the people. I think its my life purpose. :)
2	I think it also has to do with our desire for everyone to be taken care of, and be doing well.  We're happy, we want everyone to be happy, because how much better would everything be if we were all happy?  
2	Nah I dislike most people...\n\n\nAnd at the same time, crave attention from them. :( 
3	Need urgent help with my ESFJ mother	She's been married to a monster for 25 years of her life and things have been going pretty badly ever since. I am also getting my share of psycho-trauma as I can not talk to my dad without hyperventilating into a plastic bag. I finally made her understand that being too selfless is self destructive and that it is time to be a bit egoistic and leave this hell she has been enduring for "the sake of her children" (I have two brother's who seem pretty weak as they can not really speak up for what they think is right). She still lacks the courage to get out of her comfort zone and escape. Or the ability to genuinely not care about anyone. I have prepared a stay for her somewhere and know how to reach her if she goes, but that is exactly the thing I do not know how to"trigger"\n\nTL;DR: Trying to convince my ESFJ mom to leave this verbally abusive relationship with a psychopath and that there is absolutely no hope for him to be "saved". // How can I encourage an ESFJ to become more risky / not care about how other's see her.
2	SJs are persuaded best via their Si and Fe. You can also trigger their Se. When they have an "eventually" attitude, say something like "Let's go do it right now." like it's no big deal. INTPs tend to experience something similar. It's why they procrastinate like hell. Se turns "eventually" or "later" into now. It turns something seemingly big like a person's dream into something that seems like an everyday thing yet is no less enjoyable.\n\nThey want to take action, but they're "scared" too.\n\nYou can also try manipulating the energy in the environment as well as yours and the other person's. That's how we persuade and influence. Learn to recognize and read the energy in the environment, people's bubbles, the energy a person has, etc. You'll notice push and pull mechanisms, speaking power, influence, etc.
1	Try and make something other than your father her number one priority. Try framing things in a way that will get her to shift her attention from her husband to someone/something else. If you have something set up for her to go to, give her a DETAILED plan of execution.
1	What type is your dad, an ISTJ or ESTJ?\n

0	Why do ESFJ women do this?	I've noticed ESFJ women tend to have very squealy voices that fluctuate a ton. Why is that and why do they do this? Why is there so much variability in their speech. I'm puzzled, because I don't notice this often with ENFJs.\n\nWhy do they make facial expressions like this and do things like the thing these characters do with their phones?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw9_xep7Uao&t=113s\n\nDisclaimer: It's a parody, so please don't take it too seriously.\n\nAnd why is their linguistic communication like that? I guess it's Fe and Si being their first two functions and Ne and Ti being their third and fourth functions? I've noticed similar articulation and linguistic communication in ISFJs.\n\nWhy do they have trouble not gossiping?\n\nFinally, why will they look at a guy they find attractive in a manner as if they're shy, peering at them, hoping they don't notice them? I'm not sure how to word it exactly. From my perspective, it feels as if they think they know and understand based on a scammy video on YouTube or like they're trying some trick that supposedly attracts men. Maybe it's just the society we live in where politicians, schools, and businesses try to manipulate Si?\n\nSome of their communication really confuses me. I find it difficult for me to see in their heads.\n\nAn example of this is they'll sometimes giggle a bunch around me like they think I'm cute and child-like in innocence, purity, or naivety. Do they find me attractive? Are they trying to perform witchcraft? What the heck are they doing?
17	I'm trying to see past the insulting nature in which you phrased the question. What exactly is it you wish to know? 9/10 if you ask an ESFJ what they're thinking, they'll tell you. If you ask a girl if she likes you, she'll tell you. But I can almost guarantee they're not flirting with you. They are just being themselves, which a LOT of people mistake for flirtatiousness.
2	What Gift Means The Most To You?	Looking for a gift for an ISFJ and also an ESFJ family member and I'm wondering what type of gift means the most to you? Sentimental value? Practicality? 
7	Something that shows you have been paying attention to what I like or do.  Practical is nice but something to do with my interests would be even better.
5	Yes I agree with that first comment. Something heartfelt. If you're buying a gift, get something we've mentioned in passing, stuff you see me pin a lot on Pinterest. But homemade is great, really shows effort as well as forethought.
1	I agree with the two comments. Something you have thought of based on my likes and interests, even if I have mentioned them only in passing. Or something that is of sentimental value to both of us that will remind me of you. Handmade gifts are highly appreciated! It shows how much efforts and care you put into it! :)

5	ESFJ parent with INTJ child	I am the INTJ child with an ESFJ parent (grandparent to be exact). We have always had a roller coaster relationship. Anyone else experience this? Our generation gap puts a strain on our relationship and obviously the way we communicate. Or don’t communicate. The ESFJ loves to “save” people and becomes outraged when that person doesn’t bend over backwards with appreciation. Parent and I are currently not speaking. We’ve been on and off speaking terms for many years. I was a very angry child/teenager due to my initial upbringing with my mother and unfortunately ESFJ got the blunt of it. And the more ESFJ held on, the more I wanted to break free. It seems ESFJ, is incapable of letting go of the past and forgiveness. I can understand, shit was not great between us during my teenage years. But I have grown and matured substantially but can only be seen as a self destructive 16y/o girl. Never as an adult who has matured and built their own life. Any advice is welcomed. At this point, I care whether ESFJ is alive and well but I don’t care for a relationship. I may have matured and grown, but ESFJ is resentful and outrageously stubborn. 
3	Seems like you have a more growing up to do. It's not an easy match up between family members to be clashing personality types but a mature person can save face with their family members. I know up until I was in my twenties I was constantly at odds with my family. Eventually I realized that my family was always going to be my family and I could seek people like myself outside of them. Once I was fulfilled by my friends, I didn't feel so demanding of my family to understand me. I could just enjoy what I did have with them, which at the end of the day might just be that they are family.
2	Hmmmm...not sure about that dynamic, in that your ESFJ doesn't seem able to respect you as an adult.  Does your ESFJ get supremely upset when you try to set normal boundaries?  Do they get unreasonably upset and don't understand why you want to set up normal boundaries?  
1	How old are you and your grandparent? 
1	Infp need help with Se /Si friends.	So I was friends with this girl in my group who is a sensor...not sure whether esfj or entj, and I was in a really bad place in my life since many months. She was really nice at first and stood up for me everytime there was any controversy of me against my friends. But then after one incident which happened 3 months back (I still regret it, it was completely unfair on her.) She said so many things which were really hurtful (but true, mostly.) And she became really practical afterwards (towards me too) and now we barely talk. We are never ever on the same wavelength. I really cared about her and she cared about me too so I think she got hurt really bad...please any advice on how to solve this? She loves to talk but doesn't talk about her feelings much so idk how to get through to her. I find myself strongly disliking her sometimes and I'm not saying that I want to be best friends with her but I just want to find my peace and be comfortable around her. She's mostly into people and things in her environment and material things that I'm not as much into as her...so it's difficult to even strike a conversation with her. Pls guide me.
1	In the first line I said entj by mistake...I meant estj
3	Need help trying to give a dickish esfj character with a superiority complex on the wrong side of the war a reason to switch sides.	I'm writing a story in which I have an esfj character who has been raised his whole life taught that he, and by extension his family, and by further extension his entire social caste of breeding, is inherently superior to those who aren't in the same caste and to look down upon them with disgust and scorn. His Fe is very concentrated on what his society, what his caste expects of him, and what privileges he is afforded from being in the higher caste. He does have issues with taking a man's life, not because he values the man's life or likes him, but because he is terrified (the man is a very powerful man), and because killing the most powerful man you know is a scary task for a 16 year old. Also, the pressure from the expectations of his social caste to kill this man really gets to him, but he's not likely to up and switch sides to the "good" side, because he does still believe he is better than those of lower castes. His Si manifests in a disinterest on changing anything, after all, why should anything change, this is the way its always been, and he gains many perks from the way things are now. The only change he supports is to go back to ye olden ways, where those with his views had much more power. \n\nSo what are some ways I could take his motivations and use them to convince him that it is in his best interest to leave his current side? I don't expect to change all of his views, merely decide that the best place for himself to be is not where he currently is.\n\nI'm having difficulty getting inside his head, since as an ENFP fe isn't even in my main stack and Si is at the bottom of main main stack.\n\nAnd before anyone accuses me of ripping off harry potter, the thing I'm writing is a harry potter fanfiction, and I'm trying to come up with a realistic in character reason for draco malfoy to start thinking being a death eater maybe isn't the best decision. I'm planning the shift to start happening in 5th year.\n\nThank you!
1	I recommend watching this video on ESFJs in order to help facilitate getting in their heads: https://youtu.be/Ad6Xl1VG-SY
3	ESFJs, what type of person do you tend to go for?	I know this will be different for everyone, but I have a crush on an ESFJ right now and am curious. What type of person catches your eye, or what characteristics makes someone partner material?
6	I guess it depends on the person. In my case, I get to tend to be attracted to INFJs. My bestfriends are mostly INFJs and my first love is an INFJ. I love their reliability, consistence, being caring, warmth, being loving, trustworthiness, sense of responsibility, and wanting to make a difference in the world. I also love how they can read you in a deeper level and know what you are feeling and thinking without you saying it. It is even scary sometimes. Sometimes, I tend to hide my feelings because I don't want to be a burden. It feels nice to be understood like that on a deeper level. :D I also love ENFPs. One of my bestfriends is an ENFP and I have a lot of ENFP close friends. I love their fun loving nature, warmth, positivity, sense of adventure, creativity, imagination, etc. :D I generally love *NF*s when it comes to mbti. :D In general though, I think ESFJs like appreciative people, warm people, thoughtful and caring people, kind people. :D I don't know if this is related to being ESFJ, but I love people who are kind, altruistic, and who want and does things to make a difference in the world. :) These three are the qualities I love the most. :)
1	I would definitely say ISFPs: https://youtu.be/ntcBulfl_IY or ESFPs: https://youtu.be/wEVuHS-ehYo would be optimal for an ESFJ.
4	Hey all, just wondering if there are any socially awkward ESFJs? What relationships do you have with INTJs?	Based on what I've read, that sounds a little contradictory, but let's see.
3	My sister (16) is a somewhat socially awkward ESFJ, she gets along pretty well but does not feel particularly comfortable. My older brother (27) is an INTJ and they get along fine. The three of us (I am ENTP (13)) hang out a lot. It seems like she thinks he doesn't like her too much, but in all honesty he doesn't have a problem with her. That is probably why ESFJs and INTJs do not get along often is because ESFJs get the feeling they are not liked/wanted. 
2	I'm an ESFJ with some level of social phobia. So, in some ways, I can be a bit socially awkward. That's usually from the phobia, however. If I'm comfortable with people, I'm pretty well-liked by most people. \n\nI'm a software developer, so I know a lot of INTJs. We get along just fine. 
1	Interesting topic.  I would say I'm a true ESFJ to the T, I love people and have a really good emotional IQ when it comes to interacting with just about anyone and everyone.  So I wouldn't say I'm socially awkward.  I will say though that growing up, I was much more shy and behaved more like an introvert although back then, I still loved being around people.  I just did not approach people too often.  I broke out of that phase probably by the end of high school and moving into college.  By the time I got to college, I was very involved with activities and had an active social life.  \n\nIn terms of INTJs, I happen to like one right now lol so I wonder the answer to this too haha.  I would kind of agree with what @SpunkeyAlizza mentioned.  I kind of sometimes question if the INTJ likes me back when it's probably just in my head.  Unless someone makes it really concrete and is really warm towards me, I kind of have to wonder but I recognize INTJs are not typically warm and fuzzy people by nature.
3	Which is your favourite mbti type	
3	I love NFs!!! If I narrow it down more, I guess my favorites are xNFJs! :D
3	INFPs~~~ ❤️
3	Most my favorite people have been ENFP
5	Hey People! I'm Starting A Subreddit Devoted To Hippie Culture, Self-Discovery, Love, Peace And Related Topics. I Thought Some Of You Might Be Interested :)	
0	There's an esfj girl interested in me an infj guy	We both go daily to the same coffee shop.  I once went talked to her for a minute then felt nervous and left cause she's attractive.  Now she still makes eye contact and mirrors me and I smile nervously of course the thing is if I go talk I'll either be uninterested in small talk or she may find me weird as infjs can seem to sensors. I would like to know her but I don't recall interacting with another esfj before so I'm clueless thus nervous, my perfectionist tendencies and e4w5 with a 1 fix don't help either.  Besides I'm her supervisor I don't want to use my Ni to directly block or offend her Si as i know that supervision relationships can cause frustration.  Any kind of input from esfjs is appreciated\n\nTldr: In a nutshell how can I as an infj guy talk to my esfj crush without embarrassing myself or her.  What topics do you like most?
4	Hello!!! :D I was happy reading your post. :D I am an ESFJ and I love INFJs!!! ^_^ I'm attracted to them. There's really something in INFJs that draws me to them ^_^ Almost all my bestfriends are INFJs and I have so many close friends that are INFJs :D My first love is also INFJ hehe ^_^ I'm sure you'll get along fine!!! :D you can start with your common ground which is the extroverted feeling (Fe) cognitive function, her dominant function and your auxiliary. :) You are both concerned with people, feelings, and relationships so I think you can start with that. :) I can't speak for all ESFJs but I love talking about feelings and relationships on a more personal and intimate level. Probably talking about your loved ones and relationships with them. Also talking about the causes or advocacies you believe in or your beliefs in general will make me interested. I like conversations which are personal and intimate, the feeling of getting to know another person on a deeper level and the feeling that we can open up to each other. ^_^ Trust and understanding can be built from there!!! :) Just be your authentic self, too!!! We would appreciate that!!! Hope this helps! :) Hope you can also update us on your progress! Thank you! :)
2	I'm exfj, but I'll answer. \n\nI'm super into people I have a soul connection to. That spark; that click. If you and I have that, then just be you because it was *you* and your charm that attracted me in the first place. \nAnd be kind. Mean and arrogant people are 👎.
5	How does Te work in ESFJ?	
3	normally any esfj doesnt have Te
1	ESFJ (ego) Fe - Si - Ne - Ti | (shadow) Fi - Se - Ni - Te  \nTe in the ESFJ is the "Demon" function. You could say it's the least preferred of all eight functions, nearly the weakest in terms of potency, and is directly avoided (for good reason). The Demon function of any type is like "sin nature" or the "human condition", almost like a source of evil. Usually managed or ignored, but if forced to use a demon function, it can be real nasty. It's also the gateway into the super ego (which is a bad thing in this context, I know some definitions of super ego make it a good thing. different definitions).  \nIn ESFJ, the Te demon would be like an inability/disinterest in what other people think, or what the group thinks/believes. ESFJs are so focused on what other people feel (Hero Fe) and what others feel to be good/bad, and are so insecure about what they think is true (inferior Ti), that they basically don't give a crap about what other people think. They are too distracted by the Fe <-> Ti yinyang relationship that Te just isn't a concern. There are pros and cons to this, as with any type, so don't think I'm hating on ESFJs.  \nUnder extreme stress, and I mean \*extreme\* (chronic abuse or conflict, inability to use the ego, unconscious, or subconscious to resolve issues) then the Te demon may become the gateway into the super ego (in this case, ENTJ | Te - Ni - Se - Fi). This is like letting the demon out of the cage, and the super ego collapses in on the ego, overwhelming it. The super ego just wants to watch the world burn, destroy everything and everyone, and start over from ground zero. An ESFJ in super ego aka demon mode would be very legalistic, hyper focused on calling people out for errors and falsehoods, presenting facts and evidence and history to supports themselves (though not necessarily doing so correctly/effectively). Ni makes them all about what they want, disregarding what others want or what will happen to others (demon super ego doesn't care!). Se is all about the moment, and Fi would be insecure about how it feels and what it feels is right/wrong. You effectively will have flipped the ESFJ on their head, from normally being very caring to others, very concerned with what others want, very past and duty focused, and unsure of what they think is true, to instead being a dick that's going to tell you what's right, only care about what they want, only care about the moment, and only care about what they feel is right or wrong.  \n\n\nA bit rambly, but there's my attempt at explaining it. Sorry for the late comment.  \n\n\nIn response to your other comment asking why ESFJ is very conscientious;  \n\-Si Parent is very responsible and dutiful, focused on the past, tradition, and what \*should\* be done.  \n\-Ne child cares all about what other people want, and what will happen to others, while Fe Hero loves to please.  \n\-Ni trickster means they are unaware of what they want for themselves (to focused on what others want, and on what they \*should\* do to think about what they \*want\* to do).  \n\---All of this together makes them focused on getting things done for reasons beyond their self, which makes them conscientious. But only if they are given external motivation.  \n\n\nHope I helped. Cheers.
18	INTPs, ESFJs, and Intelligence	ESFJs, you're smart. INTPs are also smart, but at the same time, they're also REALLY dumb. 90% of our problems are because we're bad with our emotions. We have trouble at self-analysis, decision-making, being productive, and experiencing emotional states. We have trouble entering states of mind, feel isolated and mentally disconnected from others, have trouble with anxiety and stress, have trouble with existential nihilism and depression, everyday endurance, and have trouble building up momentum. It's because we're emotionally stupid! XD\n\nINTPs will likely deny this, but it's because they're unaware of their emotions and emotional state.\n\nESFJs may have Ti as their fourth function, Ne as their third, Ni as their seventh, and Te as their eighth, but they also have Fe as their first and Si as their second.\n\nESFJs are actually a very good match for INTPs. They experience a lot of conflict and can annoy each other, but they can also promote a LOT of growth in each other.\n\nINTPs are imaginative, creative, and innovative, while ESFJs are realistic and grounded.\n\nINTPs often lack discipline, and ESFJs are often disciplined and good about dishing out discipline.\n\nINTPs are open-minded. ESFJs are decisive.\n\nINTPs are objective and analytical. ESFJs are sensitive, warm, and good at connecting with others.\n\nINTPs can have trouble keeping in touch with people. ESFJs are great at this.\n\nINTPs often have social trouble. ESFJs are great at socializing.\n\nESFJs can be reluctant to change. INTPs are great at promoting change.\n\nINTPs are often emotionally stupid which affects their decision-making, awareness, ability to self-analysis, ability to come to conclusions, productivity, and more. ESFJs are great at sensing the emotions of others.\n\nESFJs can be worried about their social status. INTPs can help show ESFJs that it's okay to stand out.\n\nINTPs can have trouble getting out. ESFJs are good at getting them off their rear.\n\nINTPs can have trouble with practical things and be absent-minded. ESFJs are great at practical things and are great at remembering things that need to be done.\n\nINTPs can be insensitive. ESFJs are great at developing Fe in people. INTPs often hate following many rules. ESFJs can show them that there's benefit to following some rules they don't want to follow.\n\nThe biggest problems they generally have is communication issues, conflicting interests, and they can annoy each other. Although, I think INTPs and SJs get along much worse than they otherwise would because of the society we live in. We live in a time where organizations and politicians try to manipulate Si. This can be a VERY big issue for INTPs in an ESFJ-INTP relationship, particularly because of the way it's done.
8	Like, like, like. ESFJ here with INTP boyfriend and I giggled at every comment because it's somewhat true.
5	I'm an INTP and my wife is ESFJ. It's really interesting to read this. Seems like the only thing I disagree with is that INTP's are bad at self analysis. I'm wayyy better at self analysis than my ESFJ wife. I'd actually say she's horrible at introspection all together. She's just way more concerned with the outside world. But anyway, we make a powerful team because we are really good at what the other person is pretty bad at. At the same time, we find commonalities in our values which really is the glue anyway.
2	What do mean about society manipulating Si?\n\nAnyways I (INTP) tend to get along well with ESFJs. Sometimes I reluctant yield to ESFJ (ex my grandmother) but I don't do that as much with ESFJ friends and in that case the "clashes" are mainly correcting each other's stupidity. We might not acknowledge it right away but I think we eventually do and we understand it's coming from a place of good intentions.\n\nI think one challenge is that ESFJs expect openness and INTPs can have pretty high walls but ESFJs are pretty good at getting people to open up and I think once the INTP does that they both feel really good about it.\n\nI also feel like there's certain aspects of ESFJs and INTPs that when they see in the other it's like a pimple they have to pop, like when INTPs are being aloof and reclusive and when ESFJs get too wrapped up in what others think. 
2	Omg this is so spot on, well done
2	Esfj here, great post! I have been down on this relationship lately after reading some negative things on the intp subreddit. This puts a really nice spin on how we're complete opposites lol
2	Every ESFJ I have met in my life I have *hated*. Overly emotionally needy people and INTP's do not mix. You ESFJ's can not outsmart an INTP or an ENTP, we are always two steps ahead. Your dominant feeling function stands in your own way. 
3	Big 5 Correlations (x-post from r/INFJ)	Edit*\n\n##[Results Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/89k2lv/big_5_correlations_results/)\n\n-------\n\nHey there, ESFJs! I'm a mod over on r/INFJ and we've been doing this experiment to see if we can confirm any Big 5 correlations between MBTI types. So far I've got input from INFJs, INTJs, INTPs, and ENTPs, mostly. I've asked a few other types as well and now I'm coming to you :) I promise to come back with results if I get enough people to participate. Just state your type (it's ok if you're not an ESFJ) and your % scores for each Big 5 category, and feel free to add anything else from your results if you want to share. Thanks in advance! (see below for more info)\n\n-------\n\nThere is a lot of talk regarding MBTI vs [the Big 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) - [is MBTI as valid](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/08/02/what-is-the-current-thinking-about-myers-briggs), do they correlate ([1](https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/13460/what-correlation-research-has-been-done-on-mbti-vs-big5), [2](https://personalityjunkie.com/09/openness-myers-briggs-mbti-intuition-big-five-iq-correlations/)), etc. I thought a community post would be a good way to see what kind of distribution we have when we compile results. With enough participants, I'll report back the distributions and see what shakes out :)\n\n##[You can take the Big 5 test here](https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test)\n\n(it's free, the $29 "cost" refers to the cost of their premium report, and you also don't need to create an account to see your results, just click "no thanks")\n\n**Please comment here with your type (let me know your type so we're not mixing results) and the percentages for each Big 5 category.**\n\nBelow is an overview of the Big 5 for those who are unfamiliar.\n\n-----\n\n[*From wikipedia:*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits)\n\n> * **Openness** to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)  \nAppreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity and a preference for novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine. High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus, and more likely to engage in risky behaviour or drug taking. Also, individuals that have high openness tend to lean towards being artists or writers in regards to being creative and appreciate the significance of the intellectual and artistic pursuits. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven—sometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor.\n\n>* **Conscientiousness** (efficient/organized vs. easy-going/careless)  \nA tendency to be organized and dependable, show self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior. High conscientiousness is often perceived as stubbornness and obsession. Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability.\n\n>* **Extraversion** (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)  \nEnergy, positive emotions, surgency, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extraversion is often perceived as attention-seeking, and domineering. Low extraversion causes a reserved, reflective personality, which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed. Extroverted people tend to be more dominant in social settings, opposed to introverted people who may act more shy and reserved in this setting.\n\n>* **Agreeableness** (friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/detached)  \nA tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and whether a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentativeness or untrustworthiness.\n\n>* **Neuroticism** (sensitive/nervous vs. secure/confident)  \nNeuroticism identifies certain people who are more prone to psychological stress. The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, "emotional stability". A high stability manifests itself as a stable and calm personality, but can be seen as uninspiring and unconcerned. A low stability expresses as a reactive and excitable personality, often very dynamic individuals, but they can be perceived as unstable or insecure. It has also been researched that individuals with higher levels of tested neuroticism, tend to have worse psychological well being.\n\n[*From a peer-reviewed paper:*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886996000335):\n\n>The NEO-PI Agreeableness score was correlated only with the thinking-feeling (T-F) dimension; the NEO-PI Conscientiousness score was correlated with both thinking-feeling and judging-perceiving (J-P) dimension; the NEO-PI Extraversion score was strongly correlated with the extraversion-introversion (E-I) dimensions, while the Neuroticism score from the NEO-PI was not related to any MBTI subscale score. The openness dimension was correlated with all four especially sensing-intuitive.
3	I am an ESFJ, see below for test results.\n\nYour score for openness was 50%. This is in the moderate range.\n\nYour score for conscientiousness was 58%, which is in the moderate range.\n\nYour score for Extraversion was high, at 71%.\n\nYour score for Agreeableness was high, at 75%.\n\nYour score for Neuroticism was moderate, at 56%.
3	ESFJs Giggling	I swear whenever I’m around a bunch of ESFJ women around my age, they always giggle. Why?\n\nI think this is the impression I tend to give around them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Olrp_kRhjJw In other words, nice yet socially/emotionally oblivious/naive and oblivious to my external environment at times (not clumsy but having moments where I get sucked into my head). I presume they think I’m cute? It seems to happen a lot, though.\n\nThen, they see what I’m really like, and they run away screaming. :D They’re correct about me, but they don’t seem to notice the Ti/Ne at first. I think they just see “externally oblivious nice guy” and “pure, childlike innocence”.
1	lol same 
1	Reminds me of when I was a kid. I definitely had that socially naive innocence in grade 1-4. Less so in middle school although I kind of still got treated that way and it annoyed me.
4	Is that how an "immature" esfj woman displays jealousy ?	Hello dear ESFJ women, men, anyone that will find an echo within their lives about the long story I'm about to tell you.\n\nA few of you might remember me, I was the desesperate guy that tried hard to understand his ex after neglecting her and sending her away... failed miserably at getting her back and then be hated by her.\n\nWell, as I said I would, since then I constantly tried to improve myself, in every possible way and I've been really fine.\nI also got back in "good terms" with her last october after writing her a letter that basically said that her presence in my life at the worst moment saved me and gave me the will to become a better person.\n\nSince then, my feelings for her never changed, but I kept it down, we see each other in classes between internship and every time, I engage in a short brief but happy conversation. I always ask her if she is fine, give a compliment, a little joke, help her whenever I can then I leave.\n(She also has been with someone else for a couple of month so ... )\n\nThree months ago, she heard by a common friends that I was seeing someone, and in less than a week, she started following her on instagram.\nShe gave that friend an "angry face" when seeing him messaging her once in class\n\nI also made a trip with that person last month, she saw it since she follows her.\nRecently, my friend was having a party at one of my ex's friend home and she started asking about me " How I was", he said that I was fine, just got back from a trip blablabla, she answered " Oh yeah I already know about that :) "\n\nLast week, I arrived at school after a rough night and proceed to tell my friends the story ( hooked up and such), but outside the classroom.\nLater that day, another of my friend's ex was with him and she told him " Jorg does seem to be fine these days hey ?" and a bunch of questions about me hooking up and apparently her face was not one of happiness when he told her I was "really fine"\n\nThree days later, my ex was there, first time seeing her in a month, she instantly gave me a 2 seconds "death stare"\n\nI still went and talked to her the same day and two days after, for once I decided to teaser her and joke abit, she seemed responsive.\n\nSince she also blocked me from every social thing at the time after an argument I decided to ask her some advice which would have make her send me a text message, she agreed but got nothing back.\n\nTo anyone reading this much, it might be some dumb shit, it would also be dumb and boring to me if I wasn't concerned by it but I'd like your opinions.\n\nI'm not very familiar with those "games", being 1) ENTP and until recently closer to a machine than a human 2) not this immature but ..\n\nWell
5	Sounds like she's jealous to me. And strange that you're stringing her along, showing that you care about her but somehow your  relationships end up in her face. You're probably driving her crazy, and confusing her. If it were me  (I'm an esfj) if want you either completely out of my life, or in my life as what you previously were. The in-between is too difficult emotionally. 
7	Good ESFJ Characters	I’ve noticed a lot of insultingly written ESFJ characters and parody ESFJ characters.\n\nIf you want to see some well-written ESFJ characters, check these out.\n\nESFJ:\n\nStarfire (Ignorant, because she’s an alien who grew up with VERY different culture but not stupid)\n\nJenny Wakeman (My Life as a Teenage Robot)\n\nPan (Dragon Ball GT) (Tomboyish, but look how she was raised)\n\nAmy the Hedgehog (an obsessive ESFJ with a crush)\n\nSupergirl (DCAU)
4	I appreciate this, reading through reddits opinion of us on the intp board can really be a humbling experience. 
2	Jason Street from Friday Night Lights is also a really good one
7	Which subtype of ESFJ are you? Sensory or Feeling?	ESFJ subtypes:\n\n**ESFJ-Fe** - The feeling subtype is courteous and amiable, but stubborn and unyielding over important to him questions. Due to this can demonstrate excessive persistence. Inclined to finish what he has started. Finds it difficult to stop in timely manner, of which he may regret later. Tries to be serious, unobtrusive, and polite in dialogue, but often exerts strong emotional pressure upon those who, in his view, act wrongly. Likes to take his conversation partners by the hand, to touch their clothing. Knows how to host guests and visitors at home, but does so infrequently because he is more interested in public work and communication. - [**Full description**](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=ESE_subtypes)\n\n**ESFJ-Si** - The sensory subtype is energetic, work-oriented, and practical. Emotional and sufficiently direct, but also well-wishing, sensitive, and responsive towards other people. Able to correct impressions caused by his sharp statements. Self-confident, daring, and skillful in his ability to become liked by others. Coquettish and pleasant, creates an intimate atmosphere in conversation. Demonstrates physical tenderness, often embraces those who are sympathetic to them. Attentive towards people, very caring, and helpful, yet sometimes may raise a scandal if he doesn't like something. - [**Full description**](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=ESE_subtypes)
2	Sensory for me according to the description here! Yay! Good to see new content on this subreddit thanks!!!
5	ESFJ married to ENTJ - How do I separate my own opinions from his, while still showing love and support?	It's so difficult to be a wife to someone who makes enemies when you are an ESFJ. He is ENTJ, and doesn't care for creating harmony at the expense of his own pride. I am stubbornly loyal to him, but I NEED harmony, with him but also with everyone in our lives. I end up feeling the need to demonize people that he simply doesn't like so I can feel like I'm on his side and supporting him. \nIt's so conflicting, I just wish he cared more about everyone getting along. \nHow do I separate my own opinions from his, while still showing him love and support? 
3	As an ENTJ, I think he'd appreciate it more if you come clean to him about how harmful his bridge-burning tendencies are, and how unfair it is to you. It will be conflict-inducing, and there will be a fight in the beginning, but in the long run it's better for the relationship because he'll respect your honesty and assertiveness, and gain a new perspective on why his behavior is troubling to you. But if you are going to duke it out, you gotta be strong, and make sure that if he makes you feel like crap to prove a point, you can take it.
2	This sub is quiet so I'll give you my two cents. I'm an INTP but my wife is an ESFJ. As you can imagine our opinions are often worlds apart. What saves us is that are values are quite similar. That sounds conflicting but the point is if you share overall big picture values the smaller opinionated differences don't really matter and you need to be able to tell the difference. It's also easier for us because we have children together so her 'love and support' is doing all the mom stuff- which is incredible work that I could never do. Seeing each other's strengths is important, and as an ESFJ I would say this is especially important cause you guys tend to see the world through a narrow perspective. My wife is still very ESFJ but being married to me has helped her become a bit more open minded and I can tell more accepting of the fact that we differ in opinion on things and that's alleviated much friction.
2	Ooh this is a tough lesson for ENTJ to learn. They have to know and recognize they have a problem first.\n\nIt's an underdeveloped inferior Fi. \n\nGet him to develop that somehow. You might just tell him?
1	Wow i've never met an ENTJ quite like that, they're usually really nice and respectful people, so this is so weird to me..
1	ESFJ	Yesterday my boyfriend did the MBTI test and the result was ESFJ. But for me it doesnt make sense, he is really social but he is quiet and doesnt care what other thinks.\n\nHe's still an ESFJ?
7	Extraversion ≠ sociability.
3	Maybe he's just a really healthy ESFJ...
1	lol
1	I can somehow relate. I am an introvert but I am also outgoing.\n\nAnd I also know an ESFJ like that. He is nice but can be very frank (borderline tactless) when the situation calls for it. He has 51% S and 51% F though, so that probably plays a huge part.
3	Need help on dating ESFJ male.	I am an INTJ female. Currently dating an ESFJ male. He thinks I need to 'relax' and stop thinking 'negatively' all the time because that's what ruins relationships. He said I need to learn to 'trust' him.\n\nI need help explaining to him in a way he can relate to that I am not thinking 'negatively', I am just anxious on the bad things that can happen. Besides, I stalked him on Facebook and I know that he's lying sometimes.\n\nWe keep having this issue because I don't think he gets what I'm saying and that I can't just 'relax' until I've thought of the possible outcomes of everything. Help please, especially to the ESFJs who are familiar with INTJs.
3	I don’t have any words of wisdom to help mend your relationship, but I do have experience with having to end a bad one that has similar tones to what you’re describing. \n\nI’m an ESFJ (female), and my ex is an INTJ (male). A lot of what you’re saying really reminds me of what my ex felt and said. \n\nIn my experience, my ex was super analytical and have to map out every single thing that could go wrong, and then have paralysis when it came to making any decision about the relationship (he could never even commit to actually calling it a relationship until I ended it). \n\nI’m more of a free spirit and just wanted to live in spontaneity and rapid, carefree decisions. I never got to do anything with him because all of his concerns about what could happen got the best of him, and then he resented me for going out and doing what I wanted to do without him. \n\n> Besides, I stalked him on Facebook and I know that he's lying sometimes.\n\nAnd... that’s an issue. It’s an issue for many reasons. \n\nOne, he lied about things. I don’t know the severity of them, but my ex treated any lie as a betrayal, no matter how small it was.  If it is a huge lie (like he did something/went somewhere and told you differently), then you don’t need to even ask this subreddit what to do - I think you know it’s a huge red flag. \n\nTwo, it’s an issue because he’s on your watch list now. When my ex started having any suspicion and paranoia about me or what I was doing without him, it kept growing and growing until he felt like he had to monitor my every move and text message. He couldn’t let anything go. \n\nThree, isn’t that stressful to feel like you already don’t trust someone that you’ve (I’m assuming) just started seeing?\n\nI’m not saying the circumstances are the same for the two of you (and hopefully not toxic and abusive), but you might have to come to terms with a little bit of compromise. I hope he’s a caring and compassionate person and is pouring out a lot for you already, but if he isn’t, and isn’t willing to make his own compromises, then I would say why try to keep up such an exhausting relationship?
3	Well, my boyfriend is an ESFJ, he told me the same, Im an INTP. Why you are always so fatalist? The world is not going to end! ...For me I wasnt so anxious as he saw me...but then I realize that all my "negativity" was anxious. I learnt from him to relax and now we laugh of my old anxity. My recommendations is to listen to him, you can learn of what other people tell you, learn to trust yourself, and to trust that everything is going to be OK no matter what. But if he is lying, that doesnt have to do with MBTI maybe he isnt a good person for you in this moment. 
2	I'm not an ESFJ, but I love going on other subs due to my ENFP curiosity. However, one of my best friends is an ESFJ, and I think there's a lot to be said for how they go about things. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI also have two good friends who are INFJ and INTJ, and they are chronic overthinkers. They feel the constant need to rationalize every decision they make and not risk anything until they 100% figure out the pros and cons, and whether or not they could handle the pros and cons, etc., and this causes them a lot of stress. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI think what your man is trying to say is that there's a lot of power in the phrase, "it is what it is". Not everything needs to be perfect, or fixed, or make sense. If bad things happen to you, it's okay. It's a part of life. They're not as important in the short term as you think. In the long term, they do matter, and I'm a huge advocate of making a difference or questioning things, but sometimes you have to pick and choose your battles. It's okay to not make sense of something before doing it. It's okay to not think through things. Spontaneity is a huge stress reliever. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn terms of trusting him, you have to ask yourself if you care about him enough to put up with his flaws, even if they don't align with your principles, and learn to respect his differences.
5	A little question about video games	Hello all (if there is any people left here ?). I'm a fellow xSFJ, and I did a bit of research about MBTI types and RPG roles in video games, and wanted to know what is your favourite role in RPG's, why and how do you think it relates to your type ?
3	My favorite RPG style game is Fallout New Vegas and while I’ve played through it 3 times now, each time being different, I generally follow the guidelines of siding with the good guys in an up front kind of way.  No real sneaking around and making my presence felt.   Also, in relating to being an ESFJ, I think my constant desire to have a follower and never wandering the wasteland without a buddy by my side shows my love for being with others
1	In a lot of games with different types of classes I tend to go healer or anything that involves machinery (So like, the mechromancer from Borderlands 2). But I feel like the healer aspect or wanting to help out the team probably comes from Personality Type
8	Please help me express love and appreciation to my ESFJ wife.	I am INTP and I'm trying to figure out how to save my marriage. I know my wife doesn't feel appreciated or respected by me. I know this isn't true inside my head but I also know that she can perceive my behavior that way. I need help figuring out how to express things to my wife better. I need very specific strategies, statements, expressions, etc to use on a daily basis. I feel trapped by my logical brain and can't seem to come up with anything other than simply saying, "I love and appreciate you." I know she feels exhausted by me but I don't know what to do. I feel very stupid and clueless and depressed that I can't make my spouse feel loved and appreciated. I would be grateful for any suggestions or recommendations. I'm worried that I can't save my marriage. 
6	I’m an ESFJ and my husband is an INTP. I understand completely the difference in communication styles. One thing that is super helpful for us is knowing each other’s love language. I’ve attached the link below of you’re interested. Knowing each other’s love language is a huge step in being able to make your spouse feel loved. You can then search for examples of things to do for her specific love language if that is something you struggle with. Hope this helps! \n\n [5 love languages ](http://www.5lovelanguages.com/profile/) 
4	I’m ESFJ and my boyfriend of 3 years is INTP. We used to struggle a lot  with this too. \n\nPersonally, I didn’t feel that it was enough if he just told me that he appreciated or loved me. The action and physical affection must be accompanied by the words! I didn’t mind making first moves, but I couldn’t be the one constantly doing so. Initiate plans with her that you’ve already organized and then just force her into the car to go. Also something simple as hugging or kissing her spontaneously makes a huge difference!
3	I know this sounds weird but make people want to be with you. Be someone of value and someone interesting to be in a relationship.\n\nIf you're an INTP, I can hear your inferior Fe all over the post. Turn that cry baby machine off. Trust me. That's going to push her away. \n\nMy advice is have dinners, watch movies, and do stuff together. Don't force things. Let them happen organically. If things happen, it will happen with minimum effort. And don't forget to tease her and kiss her. \n\nSometimes, you don't need to say that you love them. Just hold them tight and let them fall asleep in your arms. Don't use Ti. Use Te. Speak without words.\n\nAnd lastly, don't get riled over this. You'll be an emotional cry baby that she would not want to take care of. Take care of yourself. 
3	Thanks for the comments. I appreciate any and all perspectives. 
2	Hi there, I am an ESFJ female and I once dated an INTP (he told me he had taken it prior to us dating and scored either INTP / INTJ).  Sadly, I broke it off in a little under a year.  There were a lot of minor issues but when I explained to him the reason, I told him as much as I knew he loved me, he didn't give me love in the way I needed it.  I feel like you might be going through a similar situation where in your mind, you know you love her (as did my INTP) but the delivery is getting lost in translation.  I think what made it hard was that in the very beginning of our relationship, he went way above and beyond to win my affection and show he wanted to be with me.  Over time, the real him came out which was more passive and he just didn't show that burning desire anymore.  He couldn't understand how I could break up with him when in his mind he was doing the right things as much as I explained how my emotional and physical needs were not being met.\n\nSo back to your question, things you can do.  Spending quality time is key and doing little things to show you care.  Like doing something nice for no reason is always a kind gesture.  Sending sweet text messages and also making her feel very desired sexually.  
2	Flowers weekly, even if you have to steal them from the neighbor's yard. Don't tell them you stole them from the neighbor's yard. 
2	My boyfriend is ESFJ, and one thing I have learned is that there is never such a thing (with him) as "too much love".  As ESFJ he has to have (like the air he breathes) acknowledgement, appreciation and always, always physical affection.  If we're on the couch watching the telly, he has to be touching me, somewhere.  Foot to foot, or elbow to elbow.  It's necessary for him.  So, I feed that animal because I can live with it and I want it to grow.  He takes care of so many things around the house, (for instance, he keeps my car impeccably clean, detailed and shining).  I never fail to thank him *specifically* for that.  He invested heavily in this relationship from the outset, and I never fail to remind him of how much that means to me, even a year in...I want him to know that I recognize that he isn't like other men, because in his mind, he thinks he isn't like other men.  There is some ego-stroking that has to go down to keep him happy and satisfied, and I'm happy and satisfied (very much so) with him, so I give the man what he needs.  FWIW, I'm INFP, so keeping people happy is naturally a part of who I am.  Does he wear me out?  Yeah, sometimes.  He knows that, though, and when I ask for space, he graciously gives it...although he's probably not liking it while he's doing it.  ESFJ's can come off needy, but really...these guys do so much for everyone all the time.  I can't blame them for wanting the acknowledgement and the props.  I also like the affection so I have no problem giving that to him.  We aren't the "ideal" couple, but you know, we both are wired to make it work...so we work it.
1	Show her you love her. Do little things for her. And for heaven's sake spend time with her! Quality time is so important to an ESFJ. Have a picnic, visit her at work, have regular dates. All these are very important.
2	ESFJs and INFPs	One of my parents is an ESFJ. If you're close to an INFP, what are your thoughts? If you're a parent with an INFP child, what were/are some things you notice?
5	I'm an ENFP, and I'm pretty close to an INFP. One of my best friends is an INFP, and we are literally on the same wavelength 24/7. We find the same things weird, amusing, stupid, and we even react similarly to different situations. The only difference is that I wear all my thoughts and desires on my sleeve, and she keeps everything to herself. It's hard to get her to open up to people, and she resorts to putting on a front to people she doesn't immediately trust. She's quick to make judgments and jump to conclusions about people and situations, and I sometimes have to remind her that she should give some people another chance before saying "He's/she's weird." But she's bubbly, creative, theatrical, kind, caring, spontaneous, compassionate, and a really amazing friend. \n
3	I'm an INFP, and my boyfriend and best friend are both ESFJ's. \n\nThe good: They bring me down to earth when I get in my own head too much. They're always ready for me when I finally feel like socializing. They love to feed me!\n\nThe bad: The Fe vs Fi struggle is real! It's more so with my boyfriend than my best friend, but he doesn't understand that "because it's who I am" is a valid reason to do something or not to do something. \n\nThe ugly: ESFJ's are quite stubborn! When the two of them disagree, it can get loud! (They were friends before I met either of them.)
2	INFP and ESFJ are said to be in "relations of mirage" in socionics. For further info see:    \n[**ESFJ type matches**](http://personalitycafe.com/esfj-articles/286-love-types-esfj-5.html#post2410804)    \n[**INFP type matches**](http://personalitycafe.com/infp-articles/277-love-types-infp-22.html#post10017882)
2	Your parent probably doesn't get it that you actually do feel better when you're off at the Fortress of Solitude (what you call it).  They're probably trying to figure out if they did something to make you flee to what they see as your "Island of Loneliness and Isolation".  My boyfriend's son is INTP.  He absolutely doesn't understand him, probably 70% of the time.  He tries to understand him and often he imposes his own emotions about situations his son may (or may not) be in, whereas his son is completely non-plussed and for the most part unaffected.  Things that would shatter BF really don't affect DS the same way.  DS is also very "dreamy" or as I like to put it, "in his own headspace".  This often drives BF nuts, because he likes a fast response to his questions and a fast response to his requests.  "Could you come hold this bracket for me while I screw it into the wall?"  seems like a pretty simple request.  DS will literally take five minutes to walk over to the wall and then stare at the wall and say to BF, "What's a bracket?"  This makes the BF just fly off the handle.  But honestly, DS probably didn't know there was such a thing as a bracket because in his Sci-Fi/Fantasy novella he's writing in his head it's referred to as a quorm.  This is what happens with them.  I am INFP.  I don't answer questions off the cuff for anyone.  That's just not something INFP's do.  We have to mull over our words, making sure we choose them carefully, judiciously, so they'll express in the most lovely and cohesive way the answer to whatever we've been asked.  This makes the ESFJ want to explode.  The answer should be right on the tip of the tongue.  Just let your words fly...except for me, just letting words fly out of my mouth normally results in misunderstandings or I end up looking really dumb.  I can't abide either outcome, so, we have developed a rule.  When he asks me something and he's expecting a swift answer, I hold up my index finger and say, "Please give me minute."  Otherwise he feels I'm ignoring him, acting rudely and basically giving him the cold shoulder...which for an ESFJ is just God-awful.  Mr ESFJ also has a tendency to forget that not everyone carries with them his knowledge of how things get done (remember the bracket referred to earlier).  So, when he is explaining how the shelving system is going to work and very quickly goes through the steps that we're going to need to follow to get it anchored to the wall safely and in an aesthetically pleasing way, he forgets that while he may be done explaining what he's going to do, Ms INFP me is still digesting step #3.  So, here's what I'm trying to say:  ESFJ's often see INFP's as slow (sometimes lazy), dingy/ditzy, rude, dismissive, selfish, and sometimes even cold.  Because INFP's do have to digest things, dissect things, and mull them over, this runs counter to the ESFJ penchant for jumping in with both feet, no matter what may lie under the water's surface.  While we are trying to connect the dots on how a process will flow, they're already putting the process into action and we're "just standing there" trying to see every facet of it.  When we're lost in our own headspace trying to keep everyone happy and balanced, including ourselves, they're tapping us on the shoulder saying, "Why won't you just talk to me?  You're shutting me out!"  However...in defense of the ESFJ, they are also the ones coming to the INFP saying, "Tell me what you think of this person/situation/problem.  You have the best insight and read people so well."  They like having us as sounding boards and fact-checkers.  And they almost always will take our advice because they know it's solid.  
12	Does anyone else hate that we are the most common mbti type and yet there aren’t many of us on here?	
20	They're probably out there having fun. Conversely, INTPs have all of the best factors to be the most numerous internet type. 
5	[deleted]
3	Hi! I was hoping to hear from any ESFJs out there, how you perceive INFJs? I’m guessing that because your PoLR function is our dominant function, we could come off as delusional or intimidating? Is this true?
1	Hi 👋🏼 
1	I agree with you!  I find it very crazy that there aren't many ESFJs on here!  Not sure the reason.  Maybe ESFJs are not as common as they say they are.  Personally, I don't know too many of them.
4	Why do you think that r/ESFJ has the least subscribers?	Also worth mentioning, ESFJ's shadow type, INTP, has the most Subscribers.\n\nCoincidence? I think not.
20	ESFJs don't feel as alone as other types. They're home is out amongst people, so they have little incentive to be around their own type. Who needs to cross reference yourself against others when you're a high functioning whirlwind of sass and personality.
4	NTs and NFs, particularly NTs, tend to be the most interested in MBTI due to their intuition. INTPs are usually understood by very few if any in society for SO long in life which causes them to feel lonely. When they come across the MBTI, it feels like they've come across people that understand them.
3	Extrovert + dom Fe = doesn't look like to be the kind to go on reddit at all, or who gets interested in MBTI.

5	Conversation Tips (INTJ Dating an ESFJ)	I’m an INTJ, and my girlfriend is an ESFJ (originally, she told me she was an ESFP, but she recently re-took the test and this time she had a slight preference for J over P). Despite our differences, we seem to have a good relationship, and I want to keep that going. So, what advice do you have for helping me show my ESFJ girlfriend that I care about her in our conversations? How do I ask the right questions/find the right topics?
8	As a fellow INTJ with a ESFJ girlfriend I can relate your worries. Let me summarize what I have learnt so far.:\n\n1. First of all, you MUST find out why you really like her, so you have reasons to stick to your relationship when you find yourself in doubts\n\n2. Show her you really care about her in your own way: You don't need to be corny or even fake any kind of "normal" behavior. Pay attention to her even when you know you will probably remeber anything.\n\n3. Support her: If she tell you about her problems give her your opinion but emphasize that's your opinion. I usually say something like "even thought.... IMO.... I'm with you and I really support you, so count with me"\n\n4. Ask her how was her day. Tell her she is gorgeous.\n\n5. When you feel you should gift something to her. YOLO. Do it! She will appreciate it\n\n6. Just ask her "do you feel I care about or like you?": When I read bout INTJ+ESFJ relationships the very first thing I did (after thinking a lot about the whole topic) was ask her how was she feeling about my relative "coldness" and how I express my feelings. Just by doing this I was showing I care about OUR relationship and my will to build something together" her answer was "Yeah, I think that's actually cute (for her) and I like you just the way you are".\n\nIf she likes you, she likes you. If you like her don't let her go. Show her you care. \n\nFinally, realize when you're being  dick (the INTJ karma)\n\nI hope this will help
2	You can't figure out your MBTI from a test. You need to examine the hierarchy of functions and read about the close matches. Decide from there. Also women and men have different cultural expectations which can skew the results. For example, I am ENTJ but women are not expected or accepted when they lead, even though I can see into the distant future where a plan might end up.

3	ESFJ social interactions about exes	Hello guys, I wanted to know what could be the meaning behind an ESFJ ex that did not want you back, but after some month of self improvement, forgave you after an apologize letter, started chatting with you again irl, followed your current girl on instagram, seems disastified when seeing her name on a common friend phone, has one of her friend talking to you, starts talking about her activities with her current bf when you're like 2 m from her\n\nIs it what fun look like hue
2	Regardless of her MBTI, she sounds immature and annoying.  I'm going to go with immature.  Ignore her, tell your girlfriend to block her, and get on with your lives?  
4	Any ESFJs with an INTP child (or other close relative)?	I'm a female INTP with an ESFJ mother. We love each other but often don't get along. I would like to understand her better and am curious to know, from the other side, what can be difficult about having an INTP in your family, what you would want them to understand about you. 
5	 I'm an ESFJ and my fiancé is an INTP. We balance each other out really well but our biggest difference is in how we make plans. I like to set plans a long time in advance (ex: wanna eat dinner at 7? to me means we are eating dinner at 7) but he likes to play it by ear ("let's eat at 7" means that's the goal but if other information comes up, we can change the time)
2	I literally came here for this exact reason. \n\nMe and my mom are INTP.\nMy dad and sister are ESFJ.\n\nThe problem is is that we all DEEPLY misunderstand each other and this is really taking a toll on everyone.  Me and mom misunderstand OURSELVES as well. \n\nFor me the ONLY THING that can get me angry is my ESFJ dad dismissing my thoughts as stupid or naive. My heart is racing thinking about it now.  I want to understand how my dad and sister feel when I interact with them... even though I fucking hate admiting this. \n\nI want to post back once I've given this more thought and have more of a point or plan.

2	Hi!	Bored esfj going through various subreddits.  Peek at my history, you'll see I was busy on here a few years ago, then stopped, and then periodically posted, and lately I have slowly gotten more active on here.\n\nHow are my fellow friends doing?
2	Hello !\nIt seems it's a pretty dead sub nowadays
2	Yeah, there's really only a few of us responding to posts of outsiders wondering what our deal is. XD
1	I just found this sub. Hi
4	ESFJ but shy / extroverted but shy?	I did a Myers-Briggs test and it came back as ISFJ, however I think I am actually ESFJ. As a child I was very outgoing and extroverted. However as I grew up I think I started picking up unconsciously my parents behaviour as they're both very shy and it caused me to second guess my behaviour a lot. Now I'm very shy and I isolate myself a lot through habit - e.g. I do sit in the corner of the classroom during class and I don't introduce myself and start up conversations with people. However all this hurts me a lot and gets me down. When I do hang around people I get really energised by it and become like a different person and it gives me like a high. I also get really disappointed when social situations aren't "energising" enough. Like tonight I was out for dinner but I was seated at the end of the table so I could not hear or join any of the conversations happening in the middle of the table. Afterwards I just felt down like I didn't get the "high" from socialising I anticipated? \n\nI also think with reference to being shy that is completely habitual. This makes it quite frustrating as I know I'm holding myself back for no reason and I get frustrated that I keep repeating this isolating behaviour. I am not worried about what other people think of me, I can give presentations in front of people, I can attend interviews, etc. In fact I think I probably have less nervousness and social anxiety-type thought patterns then the majority of people. My shyness is purely behavioural rather than psychological.\n\nWondering if anyone else is extroverted but shy?
6	The I/E axis is not about being shy or outgoing, it is about the direction (vector) you perceive the world: from object to subject or from subject to object.\n\nBeing shy or outgoing is just a side-effect of this and not even a guaranteed one.
1	Hi yeah i'm the same way. I'm horrible with meeting new people just because I get incredibly nervous by it. However, I definitely prefer being with friends/ hanging out with people rather than being alone, which i guess is what the extroverted part of it is for me too. But yeah, you're not alone 
5	Help me understanding the ESFJ that changed my life	Hello fellas, \n\nI'm gonna explain briefly my situation.\n\nI'm an ENTP dude that used to go from women to women and never be serious about anything.\nTwo years ago I met that person, I instantly felt that she would be special for me.\nI kept waiting for her an entire year but she had someone for a long time. \nAfter a year and being in the same uni then afterwards in the same class, she was free and within two months we were together.\n\nThe beginning was really great, I did not know how to act properly because it was my first time being serious (btw I'm 23 now and she is 20), but we managed it.\nAfter a few months she started complaining that I was "distant", not seeing her enough and stuff. \nOf course as dumb entp I was acting like she was crazy and all but ..\nEventually I had to deal with hardships in private life, I failed a internship that was important to me, and both my grandparents nearly died.\nOf course she knew about it but I acted like it was not much of a deal.\nAfter 6 months, seeing her sad because of my evasiveness and distance, I decided to propose her to break up.\n\nEventually I got better after a month, I realised that I had gone through quite a big depression phase during 3-4 months.\n\nBut I had already damaged our relation, she thought I didn't care and let her go instead of letting her in my life.\nSo I chased her from Late april to august.\n\nTo the world and me, she said it was over, she did not know why but it was, but at the same time, she always said "I don't want you completely out of my life".\nand a common friend of us whom she used to speak to told me she was clearly hesitating.\n\nEnd of august I caught her with a dude, it would not have been a problem since I'm a civilised man, but it was someone I hated for years, she did not know about it but shit began.\n\nWe were really mean to each other, I brought her every presents or little words I had of her then after an alcoolised night, I ended up beating the shit ouf of that man.\n\nIn the end we never spoke again from september till recently, but they never were together.\nSince september we are in the same class, she hangs with a dear friend of mine, one day of that month he phoned me asking loudly why I did not bang some random chick I talked to him about, she heard him and went to him saying "I can't believe he told me I was important for him all these months and now he's off fucking random girls"\n\nThen we went in a one month internship, since september I did alot of work on myself, not only for my clothes style and stuff but also my mind, I'm trying to become the man she saw in me and wanted me to be.\n\nSo I wrote her a letter, sayin that she changed my life forever and that I would always be thankful for that and other stuff.\nI gave it to her and tuesday she came to me asking to talk, she told me a bunch of things that I can resume in : \n\n- She did not want me to hope for nothing but it calmed her alot\n-She ""nearly"" felt happy about it \n- She has a new boyfriend ( I already knew) \n- She received two months ago a very late gift of mine, she wanted to give it back to me, I said I can't force you but I can't take it back, throw it away if it's impossible for you to keep it, she answered "No I won't throw it away.. That's why I wanted to give it back to you but .."\n- She wanted us to stop ignoring each other and greet once again.\n\nSo, of course me becoming another person is first for myself before than being for her, and I should let go, but even when I try, no other women gives me the vibe she used and still gives to me.\nSo, it may be childish and dumb and nearly impossible. But now that I have break the shell of her late hatred towards me, I want to keep improve and try to make her being attracted to me again, I could go to any girls it's not a problem for me, but she really is special for my heart.\n\nSo.. any advices on how to get in her high esteem again ? 
2	ESFJ-A here: I can only speak for myself but we’re a very forgiving bunch. I, too, have been put off by a lover that just pushed me away too many times and once I was done I was done. It seems like you’ve tried, which I would appreciate, but when we get involved with someone else we start giving all our passion and love to them to feel that reciprocation. I would advise you to try again but she’s been very straight forward about moving on. I would wait until she’s single again after some time, do some growing up and then go for it :)

2	ENTP here with an ESFJ girlfriend. We've been in a relationship for almost a year and every time I make her feel sad or hurt, I tell her how much she means to me deep down my heart. She usually gets happy and confident again when I tell her about the emotional connection we are having. Telling ESFJ that she has a special place in my heart really is what makes her happy again.
2	INFJ here, just browsing around different MBTI groups. I know this post was from a month ago, but am very curious to know how things have been going for you since you made this.
1	Any other opinion ?
1	>I'm a civilised man, but it was someone I hated for years, she did not know about it but shit began.\n\n>then after an alcoolised night, I ended up beating the shit ouf of that man.\n\nLmao this is like the most ENTP thing ever\n\nedit: source, since this sub doesn't have flairs, is that I am entp

9	INTP/ESFJ Relationship	How do you people feel about INTPs in a relationship? I've had an ESFJ develop a crush on me before. She mentioned my intelligence, wisdom, kindness, and will to help. I didn't feel the same way about her (it was a very one-sided romantic interest), but I found it interesting she mentioned my intelligence and to a notable extent...I think I tend to give people a "nice guy" vibe. To be fair, Goku is my hero, I like helping, and my Fi is highly developed.
5	I’m not entirely sure what you’re asking, but I’m an ESFJ and my husband is an INTP and we have a beautiful relationship.
2	I am an ESFJ male and my girlfriend is an INTP. She is fucking awesome, really smart and well grounded. Her Ti is so hot. And she appreciates all of my dominant functions. 
1	I am currently in a relationship with my boyfriend who is INTP and I'm ESFJ. Funny thing is that he started to have a crush on me.
1	There is a bad stereotype that ESFJs are idiots. We are not, Ti just happens to be our inferior. I have a high IQ, as does my ENTP husband, and he likes that not only am I hot, he can have an actual conversation with me. I find expertise to be incredibly sexy. Just because I don't possess it doesn't mean I don't like it or am unwilling to learn from it. Don't make us *feel* stupid, we will be v deeply hurt by that. Appreciate our levity and superficiality ~ not every single thing has to be Deep and Meaningful.\n\nYou asked about Ne and Si interaction. I tend to use Ne to come up with new ideas for practical problems. I love thinking about, and imagining things, though it is usually about pop culture stuff, social interactions, fandoms, fictional storylines, etc. I'm not thinking about particle physics or gaming battle strategies, though I know my husband is. I *can*, though, and can theorize all kids of wacky stuff thanks to tertiary Ne. \n\nKindness and willingness to help will get you quite far with an ESFJ.
1	INTPs and ESFJs are considered to be "dual" match in socionics meaning that your two types are said to ideal matches for each other. If you look into cognitive functions, you share every single one in common. [**ESFJ type matches**](http://personalitycafe.com/esfj-articles/286-love-types-esfj-5.html#post2410804) and [**INTP type matches**](http://personalitycafe.com/intp-articles/282-love-types-intp-20.html#post10020018).

5	Need some help ;)	Hello, guys :) I'm MBTI fan and trying to help my friend. He own small social network where main feature is Questions Game - people talk to each with pre-prepared questions or use their own questions list. The main idea to filter users and show related members are totally oposite options: 1) compatible members by zodiac sign 2) compatible by personality type. So, he created personality test which contains 32 questions. I want you to ask to take that test and tell is it accurate or not :)\nYou don't need to create an account or login to take test, but you can create it if you like the idea and want to try other features :) So, link to test is:\nhttps://www.horozo.com/personality-type-test\nAny comments, ideas, critics are welcome!
2	For Science	INTJ (M) seeks ESFJ (F) for messaging to discuss topics of a wide range and test a theory I read about that said ESFJs are the most feminine MBTI type for females.\n\nLink to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/7ff88e/in_myersbriggs_is_esfj_the_stereotypical_female/\n\nDon't make it weird, just send me a message if you're interested to have conversations, and we can add to the discussion.
1	lmao. everyone knows this already. No need to experiment anything.
3	Horrible relationship with my ESFJ dad	So I'm an international student from a foreign country, I've had my dad take the MBTI (out of curiosity) and he came out as an ESFJ. Being an ENTP myself, I seem to be the complete opposite of him which irritated him more than it irritated me. I seem to be open to more ways of doing things and he seemed to continue to ignore me and follow his older ways. Any advice on mending our relationship? 
1	I can relate heavily to this (although I'm not an international student). As an ENTP myself dealing with an ESFJ father, it can be painfully irritating at times if not most of the time. We're polar opposites, which you stated was the case with your situation as well.\n\nThis isn't the most professional advice, but just wait till it's over. Wait till you can get out. I've sought professional help but I've found that it's extremely superficial and my underlying feelings about my dad haven't and won't change. He'd still irritate me, but I was just being told not to show it.\n\nI can wholeheartedly agree with the idea that you're the open-minded one and skeptical to old values/traditions that quite frankly are useless at times, as that tends to be the scenario with many ENTPs' relationships with parents from my experience. \n\nThere's not much you can do about it, from what I've learned. In his eyes, you're the minor and therefore you are subjugated to his ways, and not the other way around. Trying to refute his demeanor or traditions will just result in more conflict and you two disliking each other even more. This is not to say that you should just go along with what he says and believes, as that'd be quite hypocritical of myself to utter.\n\nKeep in mind I am only 15, so I may not be the most creditable source for help, but hey, it's better than getting a "realize your parents only want the best for you and love them for that!!".\n\nAnyways, best of luck in your household battle of ideologies.\n\nG'day, sir (or ma'am).
6	ESFJs and Academic Perfectionism	My cousin is an ESFJ and is extremely hardworking in school. Strives for perfect scores and often gets them. Top classes. My current theory is that it stems from her need to please others and meet and exceed the expectations that have been set for her by the community. It's interesting, because a lot of people often underestimate the intelligence of ESFJs but high willpower and work ethic is a trend that defies that stereotype.\n\nIs this common among you all, or could this be a result of her unique upbringing?\n
7	I had one B during my entire high school career and the rest straight A’s (since 4th grade going all the way back), but my parents were never strict about grades, they just expected that I try; I was smart and wanted to do well, my motivation was my own
5	I dunno. I'm an ESFJ, but I wouldn't call myself a perfectionist in any sense of the word.
2	I'm pretty perfectionistic and part of it is meeting expectations and being impressive to others, or at least avoiding being seen as a failure. But a good part of it is me just wanting to be the best I can be and setting high standards for myself. I don't like to feel like I'm wasting opportunities, so for things like high school and college that only happen once in my life, it's important to take advantage and get the highest grades possible. 
1	I've seen this in a few. I think having a family which values education is helpful but generally they strive for good quality work. Compared to me who was always happy to half-arse it because I knew I could do better if I tried, and that was good enough. I'm ENFJ
1	Yup. I really didn't care about school, but aimed to please. Funny enough (as this is an extrinsic motivator only), I ended up doing pretty poorly in high school due to self esteem issues. So I think it only helped for so far, but if I didn't feel like I was getting enough emotional support from the person I'm trying to please (in this case my parents), my work ethic wavers until it nearly drops. 
1	Yeah, I've known some ESFJs to be like this. 
1	I'm an ESFJ, and I generally have good grades for my education system here in Singapore. My parents weren't very strict about my grades, they just wanted me to do my best. I just did well & studied hard because I wanted to be my best. Also partly because I wanted to please my teachers, and exceed the expectations this country set for me, since I am a migrant and they don't really expect me and the people of my race to do well, I suppose. So.. I guess I'm like what you guessed your cousin?
1	omg! I'm an ESFJ and I used to struggle with perfectionism for the longest time (just saying, perfectionism is DIFFERENT from simply aiming for perfection and trying one's best. it's much more extreme than that).\n\nWhen I went to school in Asia for a while in my secondary school years, they ranked me based on your grades each midterm exams / final exams. I became overly obsessed that I would miss one question and break down and cry... ( if you miss one question, it'll hit ur rank real hard) I aimed for 100s, but getting a 100 didn't make me happy either. To my eyes back then, it was: 100 = good enough, everything else = failure. Yeah. All black or white. I did not have "tiger parents"; in fact, they were the total opposite.\n\n I'm not THAT extreme anymore, thankfully, and I'm so much better when it comes to embracing my imperfections. This took time to overcome, though. Now, I DO try my best and aim for perfection, but I don't have that extreme perfectionist attitude. I personally know another ESFJ and he's very, very academically driven. near-perfect SAT, perfect GPA, etc. He tries really hard in every other aspect as well.
6	Personality and music taste survey -- need some data to back my thesis proposal	hi, anyone you take a quick personality test https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test <-- (don't need to create an account on the site)\nthen take a survey on your music taste? https://goo.gl/forms/lzqPk8jGD6oYXEy22\nWould be huge. Help me get preliminary validation for my hypothesis, hopefully I can post the results later on.\n\n(I know it's not MTBI ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)
1	I learned that I am 70% neurotic. How interesting! Explains a LOT actually. 
3	ESFJ guys would you ever consider dating a INTP girl? Tell why!! Thx.	So I'm talking with an ESFJ guy and he's so cool! Cooler than me by far actually. I'm kind of surprised we're still talking! Anyway, can you give your perspective on why he might be attracted to me? I mean, we are just friends, but obviously there's something about me that has kept his interest.
4	He probably finds you cool! \n\nAs for attraction, it could be a ton of things that may or may not be related to being an INTP. If you're feeling brave, you could ask. :D\n\nTo answer your question: Yeah I'd date an INTP. My deal breakers don't really have to do with type, and INTPs are generally cool.
2	I am an ESFJ and I love my INTP girlfriend! She is amazing. Absolutely smart, beautiful, and not too loud. She also loves and appreciates me for my Extroverted Feeling function and my Introverted Sensing abilities. 
5	What are some of your favorite Christmas songs?	What are some Christmas songs that put you in the Christmas spirit? I'm supposed to get some songs together for a Christmas banquet and I thought you guys might be able to help! Thank you!
2	White Christmas and jingle bell rock! 
1	look up the Christmas Can Can... best Christmas song there is, also Pentatonix
2	How do you impress an ESFJ women? OR Gain her admiration or interest?	Title says it all. How do I, as a male INFJ myself, gain the interest of the beautiful female ESFJ I like? :)\n\nThank you in advance!
6	What is she like? And what does she like?\n\nCan't really give a one-size-fits-all answer. :)
6	ESFJ Hubby/INFP Wife	So, I'm an INFP and need some advice. My hubster and I have been married for five years, and I love him oh-so-much. One thing about him alternately hurts my feelings and puzzles me: he is absolutely obsessed with what 'other people' might think. Two examples will illustrate the point. First, I love to tell a story about one of our first dates when it became apparent that while I was out of my mind with romance, he was thinking about food. It's a cute story and completely harmless in my view. Hubby recently told me every time I tell that story 'other people' will think he's an asshole. I was speechless. It used to be one of my favorite little vignettes about us, and it's one of the things that made me fall in love with him because he made me laugh. Second, we were at a work-related Super Bowl party with some of his co-workers and lots of other folks (over 100 people). I'm a touchy person and I reached over to rub his shoulder with one hand while we were watching the game. Well, afterward we had a huge blow out because 'other people' might find us touching to be inappropriate. \nNow, to be perfectly honest, as an INFP, I couldn't give a squirt of piss what most actual people think and some nebulous concept of 'other people' holds even less sway over my behavior. But 'other people' seem to rule his life down to whether or not I can rub my husband's shoulder. Do I just have to get used to this? Or can I help him be less self-conscious? Or am I the weirdo? Thanks!
5	I'm an ENFP (F) with an ESFJ fiancé (M). From what he has told me, he used to be very insecure and wasn't sure he had anything good to offer anyone when he was in his 20's. I've been told that this used to dictate much of his behavior in the past. I'm not sure if this is playing a role with your hubby, but it does seem to be self esteem related. When he is okay with himself, he won't care as much what others think (his dominant Fe will be more balanced instead of all ruling). As far as practical ways to help, perhaps encourage him towards what gives his life meaning and purpose? I think ESFJs tend to be really sensitive about their competence, as well as their ability to be everything their significant other needs. They pride themselves on being the most romantic and thoughtful, and your first date story may highlight a time when he maybe was not at his top game! Or maybe the way you tell it makes it seem as if you are more romantic that he is? Just a thought! Funny enough, I say something similar about my guy! I always say, "From the first time I met him, I knew I could talk about the deliciousness of mac and cheese forever". What I meant by this is that our discussions are perhaps not always as theoretical as I am used to, but they are still super entertaining! My guy is seriously a comedian, and can make any mundane thing a blast, and that's what I always tell him. Not sure if any of that could help, just going off the info I have! Hope it was useful in some way!! 
3	I totally agree with the self esteem comment. I alternate between not caring how others will perceive my behavior to being obsessive about how a certain statement or behavior was interpreted. \n\nFor me I'd say that I tend to worry less when I'm around those that I know and understand well. I feel they know me well enough to know I mean them no harm. (Or I know them well enough to know that their opinion of me is unimportant).
1	Hmmm. That is an interesting question! They might be! My guy is!
6	Are here more INTPs than ESFJs?	The title is self explanatory.\n\nEDIT: I posted this 4 months ago, how does it keep getting responses!?
9	Stalking all the ESFJs <3
4	This is technically /r/intp2.0 btw im an INTP
4	The idea of ESFJ coming on reddit is hilarious. You think Taylor swift spends her time on threads? only nerds, idealists and artistic types do this, sentinels are too busy being sensors to usually do shit like this. 
3	lol
2	ENTP 
2	There*
2	INTP invader here.
2	Caught me
2	I came here after I realized there must be a type that is the exact opposite of mine, and I was so intrigued I had to go to that subreddit and scroll through every. Single. Post.
1	The title certainly is not self explanatory. I'm not sure if it's a grammar issue or a typo. Help.
1	INTP here...\n\nWife is ESFJ...    \n\nConnect the dots
1	I feel personally attacked by this, let me stalk in peace 
1	INFj here, stalking, oops.
4	Question to the esfjs	Is it possible for an esfj to mistyped by others as an intp. Or rather, are there any esfjs in this world who look like intps, possibly because they use a lot of introverted thinking(albeit poorly) but know they are esfjs.
3	I think it would take some effort to be mistyped as the exact opposite, but I’m sure that mistyping happens plenty. ESFJs are rather widespread in the general public but with everyone being a unique individual, there are shades to every personality. I can be withdrawn for a few weeks at a time which may appear completely opposite of the general ESFJ stereotype and I am just as much thinking as I am feeling so typing a person in front of you in the moment can be rather subjective and prone to mistyping.
3	That's exactly my case actually. But that's only because according to the MBTI I'm an INTP/INTJ since ESJFs are retards according to it. However the jung types are way, way more solid and actually make some sense. And according to those I'm ESFJ yet that somehow doesn't mean I'm retarded, so that's cool.
3	When I was younger I was an infj 8 years later ESFJ. I think growing into my own and confidence added helped.
2	Pretty sure there are quite a bit of NP folks on here who are really just SJs unwilling to admit it. It's what happens when you have online descriptions making us out to be dingle-butts with no real prosperity in life.
3	I’m an ESFJ and my BF is an ENTP. Any advice? I know he definitely struggles with sharing his feelings and I am the opposite.	
2	I've dated an ESFJ and the problem with sharing my feelings was that he'd always give me a bs emotional response like "don't worry" or even offer practical solutions. Most times all I wanted was for him to analyze me/my problem and I already had my own opinion/solution in mind but was just curious to see if he thought the same. Also, don't say what you think we want to hear. ENTP's can catch on to ingenuine comments quickly and that makes us less inclined to share. 
1	could you elaborate a bit on what it is you are struggling with.\nas an entp ive dated an esfj before (didnt go so well)\nif you want them to open up more be brutally honest.\nits hard for us to share anything so when we do and you answer with some bullshit answer like everything is gonna be fine we dont really see a point in sharing it.\nwe are focussed on solving problems so if we come to you we wanna hear potential solutions.\n\n
1	It'd be nice to hear how things turned out.\n\nMaybe he just needs some space to think, xNTx are generally low maintenance. Since he is an extrovert you should be the first to know when he wants some company, which shouldn't be long.
3	ESFJs: How often are you on the internet? What do you browse?	*crickets*\n\n\nAsking because this seems to be the least active mbti sub. Probably due to lack of interest by most esfjs?
2	I honestly believe that with only about 6 actively participating ESFJs on this sub that the vast majority are people curious about the type than actually the type. But to answer your question, I’ve been expanding my internet browsing more over the past couple years but it’s first a resource, then a time-suck. So when I’m not looking up things or researching the main things I use the internet for would be YouTube and Reddit (I do watch this sub, I just don’t have questions to ask personally). Overall I don’t really “surf” between not having the time and just using what I want to use and then being satisfied
2	I'm on the internet (my phone) almost constantly. But it's usually just checking in on social media (twitter, instagram) or getting sucked into various Reddit wormholes. If I'm browsing, I'm usually shopping or reading articles. Or trying to gather information to set my fantasy football lineup for the week. 
1	I'm logged onto my email while I'm at work all day, and I use the internet as a tool at work quite regularly.  When I'm at home, with no other plans, I'm usually browsing Tumblr far too much, or reading.  Lately I've been on the internet quite a bit, which has meant other hobbies have suffered.  I may try to limit myself more going forward, but probably not.  Laugh!  
1	Regularly, With my free time I'm usually on Twitter (&Reddit of course, but I never post) 
1	I'm on the internet very often, using a wide range of social medias like snapchat, instagram and twitter! if i'm not at an event and just lazing around at home, i'll usually watch videos on youtube or read stories on ao3.. if I am browsing I'm usually shopping! ESFJs are really inactive in the MBTI community :/
1	What do you like to study?	What do you like to learn about? Do you like sciences, philosophy, math, etc.?
5	I enjoy learning about psychology, understanding the thought processes of others and them as a whole. Sciences as a whole seem to captivate my interest, mathematics is intriguing, anatomy&physiology is extremely useful and fun to understand and apply, physics may confound me at times but is quite interesting, and obviously more but you get the idea
3	Anthropology, as human's are amazingly complex and interesting. 
2	I like learning languages and about how to improve my running. :) 
2	Anything, as long as I deem it important enough to learn. Or it gives me some answers about how the world works
1	Theology and Sociology - Why people believe what they do, What people do what they do and ultimately what are they living for.
3	My girlfriend is an ESFJ... I need advice.	1) What are your biggest fears in a relationship? \n\n2) my girl is EXTREMELY decisive and never looks back once she has made a decision... we have been together for 2 months and she is already talking about getting engaged and having kids... if I try to slow it down and talk about it, she either accuses me of having doubts, or "questioning what she wants..." I can't bring up important topics of convo like this without conflict. So frustrating!\n\n3) my girl wants consistency and a routine/dependable reliable marriage and husband. She always talks about how she wants kids and can't wait to get married.. two things I don't care for at this moment in my life. Is this common among any of you?\n\n4) I'm an ENTP and think more logically. I swear I say atleast one thing every single day that upsets her or offends her, she thinks I am insensitive (which I am), but I am mindful of her feelings--I just don't understand why some things I say upset her. \n\nI would love to just hear how some of you ESFJ's (particularly females) are in relationships. Even if you don't directly answer those questions, I just want some feedback. Thanks!
9	Regardless of her M-B, if she can't sit down and have a calm conversation with you about what YOU want, and YOUR timelines as well as hers, and yours together as a relationship, I would be concerned about this relationship going anywhere.  2 months and talking marriage is VERY fast in my book, unless you're both over 30.   
3	Lol fuck this xxxx stuff, talking about marriage and kids only 2 months in? That's crazy man. Idk about you but I'd be running if I heard those words so early on. 
2	2) doesn't sound like a Ti-Fe user, are you sure she's not actually some xxFP type? 
2	She sounds unhealthy but I'd say this is common. An ESFJ friend got engaged twice and broke it off before finding the right guy to marry. Having a family is incredibly important to them. As the other commenter said, I'd be very very cautious about continuing the relationship if she's already wanting marriage at this stage. It doesn't sound healthy for either of you.
2	Based on her quickness to ignite, coupled with her inability to have real conversations about serious topics, of say that she'd be an unhealthy example and you should carefully examine your future together as it is. ESFJs are very family orientated, but an unhealthy ESFJ could turn it into a sensitive fixation. The same is true with the depths/significance of interpersonal relationships; I would suggest caution before sinking neck deep. Best of luck to you though

3	What do you think of ENFPs?	
5	ENFP here married to ESFJ so I don't actually qualify to answer this through my ENFP bias buuuut, he can only handle one of me, and doesn't naturally connect with ENFP friends in his social environments, but we have a lot of fun together and have a very happy marriage (6 years now). I push him toward constant personal growth and adventure and he keeps me grounded and helps me think about other people's feelings. Also his snap judgement of all other ENFPs is that they are shallow. 
2	I've done MBTI questionnaire a couple of times. My results have been both ENFP and ESFJ. So I like them! 
2	Insight into how an ESFJ would react in this situation needed please	My fiancé and I are planning to get married in the next couple of months, and this is pretty unexpected as he only asked me just under a week ago. The reason why we want to get married so soon is that I have breast cancer and I may need to have a double mastectomy - based on the results I'll receive in September. I feel very distraught about the operation and my fiancé wanted to show me his commitment to me regardless of the results. It makes me really happy and gives me something to focus on at an otherwise depressing time. \n\nThe only thing that's stressing me out is that my fiancé and I had thought it might be easier/less stressful to leave out having guests at the wedding. I can see merits to with/or without guests, though it's worth bearing in mind that in the UK one needs two witnesses, so having a few guests makes sense - plus my grandparents are very old and I might regret not inviting them in the future. \n\nThe one person I'm stressing over inviting is my auntie - who I believe to be an ESFJ. She's incredibly loving and has been really good to me since I've been ill - but her and my fiancé have come to blows before and they don't think highly of each other generally (my fiancé is an ENTP). Also I no longer have a relationship with my mother or brother (my mother is my auntie's sister) and this is a source of strain to my auntie, and I feel that if she comes she will be upset about my mum and brother not being there, and that will upset me and detract from the optimistic vibe I want to have on the day. \n\nSo in light of this, how do you think she would react to not being invited? Is there anyway I could come at this that wouldn't upset her? Do you think I'd regret not inviting her? Your help would be such a valuable insight right now - I want to respect both my fiancé and my wishes but I don't want to crush my auntie as I really love her. \n\nThanks for reading 
2	ESFJ here, and I'd first speak for everyone by saying congratulations on getting married and we wish you the best in the days to come. When it comes to your auntie, assuming that she is an "average" ESFJ, I believe that the best place to find an answer is directly with her with some open, and likely a bit stressful, conversation. I can say with a good amount of certainty that if you have a good relationship, it will hurt her to be left out because of the importance of the occasion, it may cause her to feel abandoned in this instance. In my personal opinion, I would find time to talk with her and after she is aware of the situation ask her if she'd rather not go, or if she'd like to be there and support you. ESFJs overall want to help those close to them more than almost anything else so I do not believe it would be a "mistake" to invite her, she wouldn't want to do anything that could ruin your special day especially if you emphasize its importance to you. In the end, it's your wedding so make sure that you are happy with any decision you come to, so maybe just having a casual conversation with your auntie could help you to see how she feels on the subject and give you a better sense on what direction to take. Hope this helps!
3	Help with esfj fiancé	Hello, I am an enfp (f) engaged to an esfj (m). My fiancé and I have been together for about a year and a half, and I have hardly ever seen him depressed or angry. Well, some family drama has started happening between his divorced parents, and I saw a side to him I have never seen before. He got depressed and angry to the point he was inconsolable and started pulling his hair and saying his chest hurt. In situations like this, in my family I was always the "fixer"...able to help my family members feel better through analyzing what's going on and cheering them up by talking about solutions. Well, with my fiancé, this "fixer" role DOES NOT work. I have heard that ESFJs rarely show their emotions, and I'm not sure how to help him with this. It does not help that I am a therapist either, because I want to therapize and fix the problem, which doesn't seem to really help. I'm used to being successful at my role as a helper, but in a (healthy)romantic relationship, I'm finding this really doesn't work.  ESFJs do not have Fi, I'm wondering how they do deal with their emotions. My fiancé said he's just going to "not let it affect him" and "just ignore it and decide to not feel it anymore." I know these things to not be helpful when dealing with anger, therapeutically speaking. Anyways, I'm just very concerned. If there are any ESFJs out there, what have significant others done for you in the past that was helpful in times like this? \nAlso, random side note: he got very angry at the pile of dishes and our small apartment before getting to the root of the problem, which was family stuff. Maybe a way to help is to tidy up? 
3	I'm an ESFJ, and this is a tough one. When I get to the very rare "overly depressed or angry" stage, I usually cannot be approached or settled down until I have decided that's what I want to do. Despite having my (then) significant other settle me down, it wouldn't work.\n\nSomething to mention, is that while being in this state EVERYTHING bothers you. Any mild issue that would typically not be a big deal will seem outrageous. I feel that is what happened with the dishes. It was just something that was slightly irksom, but in that state of mind it is just another thing. (for instance, loud chewing for whatever reason pisses me off to no end.. but only when I'm in that bad state).\n\nWhat I have found to help me, and granted this may not work for him... but just having you in the room with him while he chills and thinks it through. I would just lay on the bed/ couch and my significant other just lay there with me and rub my head... we'd just sit there until I was able to calm down enough to decide to talk about it, or at very least just settle down and table the discussion for later.\n\nI hope this helps. 
3	Intensely negative emotions and ESFJs have a tumultuous relationship. With a personality that produces actions that prioritize others, there is often a lack of self maintenance; this development is usually able to be handled but if something intensely provoking arises, the defenses to handle the negative emotions may not be present or properly fortified. In this case, I believe that is being displayed through his bottling efforts as an alternative measure that I can warn personally leads to an increase in irritation, anxiety, and stress. If I had to make an educated guess based on my personal experience, finding a proper release for his emotional bottling would be a positive turning point for him. He likely believes that his feelings are a burden since he has expressed the desire to "ignore it" and is thus less likely to open up. Making sure he does not feel alone is what I would suggest, being present and providing assurance is the best place to start. After feeling more secure, opening up is less of a challenge and provides some release. Hope this helps some.
1	Hello! It is I, an ENTP	I'm researching how the different MBTI types like to be asked out/approached romantically for an article, and would like (semi) serious answers. So, if someone was interested in you, whether it be a friend or a stranger in a bar, how would you appreciate someone asking you out in a romantic fashion? Thank you!
4	Despite usually being able to perceive the emotions and feelings of those around us, I personally find myself to be generally clueless as to whether someone is showing interest in me. An ESFJ will likely assume that he/she is just being friendly before believing it to be a romantic interest largely because we try to be friendly to everyone ourselves and we may see it as self-absorb to think it would be anything else. So unless the attraction is strongly shared, I'd recommend being upfront about one's feelings with an ESFJ if they are romantically inclined, otherwise it may take multiple obvious hints before it will catch on.
3	As a ESFJ, just ask me out and be clear with what you want. If you are not clear about it im gonna go crazy in my head and start to overthink. If you want to go to a date, ask me on a date. If you want to hang out as friends, then please ask it in such a fassion.
1	just kiss her (im an ESFJ)
2	Is this ESTJ actually an ESFJ?	Hi everyone. ISTJ here. I met a guy on a dating app back in February. He claims to be ESTJ. But I never understood him and he always drove me crazy. Since we STJs should definitely understand each other, I keep questioning it. This morning I had a lightbulb moment where I was convinced he's ESFJ.\n\nHere are a few observations about his personality:\n\nHe seems to be very last minute (spontaneous) even though I am a planner and I have asked him to give me more notice. He ignores my request and keeps initiating things at the last minute\n\nHe remembers so many lines from so many movies. He also speaks 4 languages.\n\nHe restores cars as a hobby and works in customer service as a job. Although he doesn't like his job.\n\nHe is very open about his emotions, past relationships, etc. Even from the very beginning.\n\nHe is a neat freak. The worst I've ever seen.\n\nHe seems overly concerned about wasting my time.\n\nEven though we've messed around tons and I've told him I want sex, it hasn't happened yet. (WTF??!!!)\n\nHe keeps the relationship going. I've always just sat back and let him pursue me. And he does. Things fizzled out after about a month but then he came crawling back about a month later. (I'm not usually like this. In fact I'm usually the pursuer and obsessed over the guy I'm dating.)\n\nHe seems controlling, but denies it. In fact it appears more like disrespect. Examples: He insists I speak French while his English is perfect and my French isn't. He forced himself into my basement after I repeatedly refused to let him see it. He refused to let me see his apartment for the first 4 months of our relationship because he was bothered by our income disparity.\n\n
1	> He seems to be very last minute (spontaneous) even though I am a planner and I have asked him to give me more notice. He ignores my request and keeps initiating things at the last minute\n\nI'm an ESTJ, but this doesn't sound like ESFJ at all. If anything, he sounds like an xSxP, probably ESFP. I kind of want to say ISTP because he restores cars and you know how the stereotypes go lol.\n\nAlso, ESTJs can be quite controlling but usually admit to it. I like to think of it as a strength, I make other people get shit done :P
2	Any ESFJ's live alone? How do you deal?	
1	I live alone and I'm only at my house mostly for sleeping. I tend to stay busy unless I plan a night at home to clean or meal prep or something like that. And even those nights can get interrupted with plans lol.
1	I did for a year and it was no fun at all. Luckily my job had me interacting with 120+ people a day, but I was still bummed out after being surrounded by friends in college in my living space.\n\nI tried to join community events and stuff, which kind of helped. But where I lived was a sleeper community for DC/retirement area with most people either school aged or over 40. And it was juuuuust far enough from DC for me to go too often, with being busy with work and all. It wasn't the best year of my life, but I managed.\n\nI'm making sure that where I live next has an average age of under 40 lol! 
2	Favorite quotes, poems, lyrics, phrases?	Hi ESFJs, I need your help!!! I have an esfj cousin who has been planning to get a tattoo and has asked me to help her design it. So far she has decided she wants a scenic view of the sun setting over a beach, and under it she wants a quote about staying happy or always seeing the light in life. She tasked me, an infp, to help her find the perfect phrase, but nothing yet has particularly stuck out to us. So I'm wondering what are some of your favorite lines about happiness or finding beauty in life? Anything that strikes a chord within you, I want to hear! Thank you 🌞

1	relationship wall	Hi, im ISTP\nhad an ongoing relationship with an INFJ for a year.\nit was a cosntant struggle with her depression and various physical problems.\ni have invested emotionally and materially in her health issues.\nthere was progress on this side, but it did not translate into our intimacy.\noverall i have given on all sides, my concepts , philosophy, my money, my time, and my emotional energy.\ni dont feel like i got much in turn, she wanted to give, but she wasnt giving me anything, she kept making efforts that went down the drain.. you can realize this is frustrating on both sides.\nits like a father giving his son money with love, and the son wanting to give back to his father by investing it in a shit shaky business. what i care and cared for our intimacy and relationship, her well being.. and everythign she did .. although well intended ended up hurting herself and myself.\nim spent . we had a talk about her nutrition last time, and it escalated and she hasnt contacted me in a month.\ni feel like i should pull back. ask her sister to pack all my things and take her without seeing her
3	I am honestly not sure why you're posting this here, but here goes nothing.  If she hasn't contacted you in a month, I would say you are no longer together.  Try reaching out and asking if you can get your things back, and if she doesn't reply, then ask her sister for her help.
10	ESFJs suck	***TRIGGERED***
18	Excuse me while I internalize this and become insecure for years to come.
12	Since I identify as a Dyson vacuum cleaner, I'll take it as a compliment. This post has turned me on! 
7	ESFJs are one of the best types...
3	why and what's your type?
2	Hmm. I guess all types when unhealthy are honestly cancerous.\nI think subjectively I may dislike the unhealthy ESFJ more than any other type, perhaps because I'm an NTP (functions in reversed order = perhaps most easily offended by unhealthy functions in the opposite), but I also love healthy ESFJs over everything else - assuming there is such a thing and I'm not just blinded by my own needs and desires. I don't know.\nPoint is you can be awesome and you can be cancerous imo. Same probably goes with all types of people, eh.
5	What are some things that make ESFJs happy?	What are some things you do or feel that make you glad to be alive?
9	My favorite is when I'm with a group of friends and everyone/everything is just clicking well. That's the best. Like, everything is in harmony! \n\nI also love running, even as a beginner, and generally taking care of my health and hygiene. I put a lot of time into this (especially oral care) and it feels nice to be clean!\n\nAlso, going to sleep after a productive day feels great. Like that moment when you first get into bed!
7	ESFJs tend to be happy when others they know are happy. I see a lot of ESFJs getting stressed over the fact that a connection with someone they are with might break apart
3	Knowing that someone else is happy and I made that happen makes me really happy.
2	I love being around hilarious people that really make me laugh and take me on adventures. I love spontaneous people that take charge of social situations and make things fun and exciting. \nI love having a clean house that smells nice, and taking on new and interesting projects like making my own cold brew (which i do all the time now) or just cool new recipes and DIY projects. \nI love planning things like my wedding or future parties with unlimited budgets just for fun. I also enjoy practically planning. I definitely have a pinterest account.\nI really enjoy catalogging (sp?) my daily progress on a goal, whether it is weight loss, fitness challenges, homework/grades, personal goals, etc.\ni also just love having a supportive group of friends that i can always count on to make plans with and generally have a good time. I don't necessarily need people i can open up to because i feel like a burden when i do that but i do need to feel like i have a solid group of people that like me and want to be around me.
4	How Would You Best Explain And Describe Your Type (ESFJ) To A Person Who Knows Nothing About Myers-Briggs?	No need to be technical.  I just want to know how you perceive yourselves and others specific to this type.  What do you notice that resonates with the ESFJ personality type? Instead of “traits or characteristics” that are so often used within the Myers-Briggs terminology, I would like to hear examples, stories, and/or perspectives you can offer.  I plan on posting this question in each Myers-Briggs specific subreddit to help foster understanding and create insight through first person experiences and perceptions. 
2	Im an INFJ who have a cousin that I used to get along with that's an ESFJ (same age as me, 18). So I'll sum it up with my own perspective and opinion/thoughts about her:\n\nGood points:\n•Sometimes can understand me when I say something "bizarre" that other people we both know dont get\n•Is generous; always buy me a souvenir when she travels to somewhere\n•She's most 85% of the time being meek, so she just goes along with whatever the plan is\n•She acts weird that I dont see everyday so that's what makes her funny. And also sometimes say it weird\n•She's ok with babysitting but not me\n\nBad points:\n•In a conversation when she's being countered or embarrassed/humiliated, she becomes heartless with attitude and most of the time say something unnecessary (too defensive)\n•She cares a lot about her reputation so she can be dishonest or avoid the question/convo if its too "personal"\n•Now she goes on her phone a lot checking her Snapchat every 3 min. And bc of Snapchat she still reply to my msges early and for 10 min or less we keep replying to each other, but after that she wouldn't reply for an hr+ and she would stop reading or replying even if I sent her a long text. This happens every time I msg her (I'm the type who hates late reply)\n•As for her college decision, I think she's going for college that's popular with good rep, but not a college that will help her career 🙁\nIk there's a lot more but I can't rembr them. These are the main points about my cousin tho. I hope it helps.\nExtra fact about my cousin: When we watch horror movie and comes to a scary part, she looks down and sometimes look at how others r watching ir reacting it. I find it annoying 
4	Curious Intp dropping in.	Where would I find an esfj in the "wild"? I'd really like to if not have a long conversation then at least follow around (in a not creepy way. Ok following some is creepy. Darn), for a day and see what they do and how they interact. If I met one I might just hug them (out of excitement), maybe (if that wasn't creepy. It is. Darn). From the description I would like them a lot as long as we never discuss certain subjects.

7	ESFJs & Depression	Hey y'all, ESFJ here. Was wondering if any of you deal with depression and/or anxiety? How do you cope? Is there any way your depression/anxiety gets triggered? \n\nRecently, I've been feeling terrible. Usually, I cannot emotionally afford to be alone. As of lately, however, my depression/anxiety has taken over my life and, as a result, I've been spending countless days home alone. I know I should do something about my situation, but it gets harder and harder with each day that goes by. 
2	Are you lonely because you're depressed or depressed because you're lonely? I've gotten caught up in cycles where the two basically feed into each other.\n\nAlthough depression and anxiety isn't something you can turn off like an on/off switch I think there are often causes that can be addressed.\n\nIn my case, it often has to do with a difficulty in forming new friendships when my social environment changes. I can then turn to online communities to try to fulfill those social needs but it still feels less satisfying than real life interaction. I also need those friendships to help motivate me through difficult or boring work so I'll turn to online communities or other activities that will keep my mind engaged (ex video games) as a form of escapism from my real life commitments and also as a futile attempt to fulfill those social needs because I'm unable to create better alternative means for fulfilling them.\n\nAt that point my studies/work related commitments start getting neglected which causes me to be ashamed in those work/school settings and basically avoid people - including people outside those environments like family because I'm afraid they'll ask about work/school and I don't want them to know it's going badly - which just makes the social situation even worse. \n\nOf course I can't avoid the reality of the situation forever, and in the moments when I realize I'm going to have to face reality the anxiety can get pretty bad. \n\nI'm still not that good at avoid situations of loneliness, but now that I'm more experienced with those situations I'm at least more aware of how these things can affect me and where it can lead if I'm not careful.\n\nI'm not sure how accurately this describes your situation (I'm INTP not ESFJ) but I'd encourage you to think about what's bothering you, what's driving you to act in certain ways in response to those problems, and where you think that will lead, and where you'd rather be headed instead and what's the best way to get there.
2	Hey /u/Rinconnn \n\nI know this is a month late, and you may take this as poor advice... But I wanted to let you know what works for me as an ESFJ.\n\nI do get random bouts of depression/anxiety, and I find that I get depressed when I don't do anything during the day that I would feel is helping me in the long run. For instance, a day that I hit the gym, or do my laundry/ mow the lawn... Little things... But if I don't do anything constructive I feel TERRIBLE.\n\nI also get anxiety from work. When I am back home I feel like I should still be doing something, or else I'm letting others down.\n\nThe answer to these problems for me? Again, you may not be a fan of the answer... But it is Marijuana.\n\nI smoke a little once I am home and know that I am done for the day. It has helped me calm down and enjoy the 'here and now', so to speak. \n\nOtherwise, just getting out of the house and doing something productive really helps as well. :)
1	I'm an INFP and I struggle with the two my entire life. I have been coping by using meditation, exercise, listening to Abraham Hicks and amino-acid therapy, notably: L-Tryptophan & DL-Phenylalanine.\n\nI feel you though and wish you well.
1	everytime im lonely or i feel like people don't like me i become very depressed. At times where i have been socially fulfilled by a wide circle of loving, supportive friends, my depression goes away. i also sometimes experience a little social anxiety when people don't make it obvious that they like me.

6	It's a shame because I'm really interested in learning more about ESFJs!
2	lol
1	ESFJs, I have a self-care app prototype I want to show you!	I've been designing a self-care app for FJ types, and I've just finished a prototype. I'm looking for folks that could user test for me today. Participating is very easy, and I would greatly appreciate your input.\n\nReply to this thread or message me if you're interested in checking out what I've been working on!
1	I'll check it out! :) 
1	I can test as well :) 
4	I want to know what self-care is like for ESFJs	Hi! I'm designing a self-care app for FJ types in the Myers Briggs system. \n\nI'm an INFJ myself, and I really care about doing this project right. If you could share your thoughts on this survey, I would appreciate it immensely: https://goo.gl/forms/witvsfsiwK7rsMJz1\n\nJust fill in what you feel like answering. Everything is anonymous & I don't ask for any personal info. \n Any little bit helps. Thanks so much!!
1	[Academic] Perceptions of Self and Intimacy (20-35yo)	Hey there, hope you don't mind me attempting to pick your brains for a minute - I got good participation levels from other MBTI groups so I thought I'd extend it to all groups and try to get a more representative sample. FYI - the study is not collecting personality type information.\n\nMy dissertation for my masters in psychology is looking into one possible explanation for avoidance behaviours in forming intimate relationships. If you are 20-35yo and keen to contribute to my study then you can do so by following the link below. Any questions give me a shout, also I'm happy to discuss and hear your thoughts on the subject off the record if you want! It should't take too long but you're free to stop at any point anyway. It may cause some emotional distress as it involves some self evaluation so if you experience any discomfort and would like some guidance please get in touch.\n\nI will leave the survey open until the end of this week.\n\nCheers! \nhttps://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/F3BXHWN

1	kewwwllll. you esfjs really like getting people together. im an istp. ill say hi sometime.
3	ESFJ - what to do with my marketing MBA?	This is probably very ESFJ but I have worked in accounting, marketing and business development, and diversity and inclusion work over the past 10 years (2-4 years each). Eventually I get bored and frustrated with each role because I don't feel I can impact peoples' lives for the better directly and the roles feel very administrative/rote. All roles have been for professional services firms (accounting/law firms). Because I like process and organization I can keep going like this for a while but I don't feel satisfied. I finished an MBA in Marketing about a year and a half ago, while working full time, and I will be looking for my first post-MBA role this summer. I'm hoping to take this time to perhaps find something a bit better suited for me (I worked while in school and am already in middle management so I recognize I may have to take a step back to gain specialization experience, but that's okay if it means I'll feel more satisfied long-term). I thought I'd reach out to fellow ESFJs who may be in the business world for their input. \n\nI have learned I prefer smaller to mid-sized companies for the opportunity to personally get to know colleagues.
5	INTJs - do ESFJs hate us?	My experience is that INTJs and ESFJs cannot stand each other. How is it possible? How can I build bridges with them? The issue is that I have never been understood by them. Most of my family is I/ESFJ as well as a significant part of colleagues at work. As that time goes, I get better and better at conflict management. ESFJs do not want to understand my ideas. They seem hostile and intolerant. Supposedly ESFJs are collaborative but I see it rather differently: all due respect you seem to be overemotional, tyrannical. Here I usually compare you with those who accept political correctness to such an extent that it crushes free thought, progress and simply logics of bare facts. Some of ESFJs tried to manipulate and play some "gray eminence"-style social games in order to destroy my reputation in my community (by describing me as somebody as very bad who should be cast away from society). Why do you attack people vulnerable emotionally on the emotional level? Why do you reject logical thinking? Wanna know!
6	A few things:\n\nI get along with the few INTJs I know that aren't mistyped. There are two in particular that I love to chat with about typology. So I don't buy the INTJ-ESFJ conflict stuff that gets thrown around.\n\nAlso, you seem to have a very biased and incorrect view of ESFJs. Let's not forget that we value Ne and Ti, so we do appreciate ideas and certain theoretical concepts at the very least. We aren't the dumb sheeple you make us out to be.\n\nLastly, that seems pretty severe of them (though there are undoubtedly some ENFJs and ESTPs mixed in with the people you talk about). What's their side of the story? Because while I'm not saying it's justified what others are doing to you, you seem too unaware of how you come off (insulting, cocky, etc.) to make me think that you're totally innocent here.\n\nAlso, let's not pretend that Ni is always a paragon of logic. :P 
4	I mean if you have multiple people who "describe you as somebody who is very bad who should be cast away from society" then don't you think that it's possible that you're just a dick? I get that there are some people that you can't mesh well with but there's a point where you should start looking at yourself. 
2	Hmmm my fiance is an INTJ and I'm an ESFJ .... he drives me crazy sometimes but mostly makes me incredibly happy and helps me not take things too seriously. Perhaps it's that dichotomy that's impacting your interactions?
2	INTJs and ESFJs are in what's called "Conflict" relations in socionics. Conflict types are the types that are least compatible due to incompatibility of cognitive functions. You guys basically think, feel, and appreciate things so differently from each other that it makes it difficult to get along. Usually "conflictor" types will try to keep at a distance and may admire each other from afar. If they have to work or cohabit together for long period of time, tensions build up and then one or the other explodes, resulting in a conflict or a fight. It's best to give each other space and divide tasks if you have to work together.       \n    \nAnd it's not that ESFJs "reject logical thinking" - it's that they appreciate it when it's given from Ti while the INTJ provides only Te.   \n    \nIf you'd like to read further about socionics intertype relations, check out this table (ILI is INTJ and ESE is ESFJ): [Wikisocion: Intertype Relations Overview](http://wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Intertype_relations#Complete_Table).
2	Hi there! ENFP dropping by with some insight as to why you may be having issues with ESFJs.\n\nYour personality types naturally clash in the way that you approach situations. ESFJs approach problems more emotionally, whereas for an INTJ emotion has no value or place in problem solving. Furthermore, an ESFJ is not generally going to budge willingly on their stance due to their assertive nature, regardless of the facts that you throw at them. I know it's difficult for you, as you've gathered and know all of the facts, but you have one of two options...\n\n1) Let them crash and burn.\n2) Let them believe it was their idea in the first place.\n\nUsually option two is the best, because as an INTJ you only care about the best results, and the ESFJ will revel in the glory...\n\nThe reason you're running into the issue with the ESFJs pitting other people... not against you necessarily... but rather with them is that their personality type is that of a leader. They're going to get people on their side to support them, while you feel all you need is the facts.\n\nAnyway, I'm at work, so I've got to run... I'll try to add more later... Hope this helps!
1	Little late to the party but my best friend is an INTJ and we have an amazing relationship. She has helped me develop into a very highly aware individual. She taught me how to be less vulnerable and emotional, as well as become more self-aware and logical, which in turn really helped me strengthen my strengths and work on my weaknesses. We also focused a lot on my confidence. We were very compatible because in turn, her weaknesses were my strengths. Anyways, to sum it up what helped me the most with understanding her was that she would always explain why she thought the way she did. Also that she was constantly focusing on big picture and her self, where I am the opposite. I feel like I am not even coming close to explaining it all therefore I would like to finish by saying "I wish she was here to explain it to you" - but I am sure you already concluded that. Bottom line, your family has to be open to how you think too, which is hard if they are extremely irrational and resistant to change. 
0	INTJ here and I am dating an ESFJ and what you said exactly describes my girlfriend's personality. I never worked with an ESFJ outside of my girlfriend so it's a different situation in a way. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThey do everything you just described because they are not logical like we are. If they are going to attack, it's going to be emotionally and playing social games. When my girlfriend argues with me, there are always lots of flaws in her statements but I just grown used to it to not say anything. She is stubborn. She does not care about how things work. She finds it boring. She just wants end results and only sees end results. She has her emotional tantrums too.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHowever, some of her behavior may be due to her having PTSD and traumatizing experiences as a victim of many sexual assaults. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI do not think ESFJs are bad people. They are extremely sweet people but things can get ugly fast if the wrong things are said to offend them. 
1	A new video about ESFJ, cute cartoon!

1	Enfp (F) dating an esfj (M) and I have some questions.	My boyfriend is an esfj, or at least that is what the MBTI test says. Sometimes I wonder if he has been mistyped, and other times I really see the esfj shining through. My best friend from high school is also an esfj, and when she met my boyfriend, both of them said "we are like the same people!!" I laughed at this because I knew they were both the same type. \n\nThe thing that fascinates me, and also sends me into an analytical frenzy is the way that ESFJs can defy their stereotypes. For example, my boyfriend is not super" traditional " at all, and neither is my esfj best friend. My bf is not crazy about the idea of having kids, even though he interacts with most of them well. His family is pressuring him to start a family (awkward for both of us since we've only been dating a year), and it makes him really mad, which is surprising because I always read that esfjs are super family oriented. He has even tossed around the idea of moving AWAY from family with me to California. Sometimes I worry that he is giving me lip service and sacrificing his needs just to please me, but then I look at his history. Before we even knew one another, he had moved out of town and away from family on multiple occasions for his work, and has even gotten resentful towards them for pressuring him to stay put.\n\nHe also does not gripe at me about cleanliness (I am a slob in comparison to him though). I have read that esfjs tend to be neat freaks, but at home he really isn't. Maybe he uses this energy up at work? Or maybe he's just suppressing his tendencies at home? I don't know. \n\nAnyways, I am writing the esfj community to see if any of you can relate to how my boyfriend is. Is this common esfj stuff? Perhaps esfjs don't fit into their stereotype? Why do you think they are often thought of as superficial, gossipy, neat freaks? I don't see this at all. Anyways, share your thoughts, yo!!!
1	How is your boyfriend like with his friends and "Found Family"?  Is that part of his life pretty important?  Maybe it's more about the people he knows love and respect him, and maybe his blood family just isn't?  \nAlso, not sure about cleanliness, but does everything have its place?  Maybe it's more about "This goes here." and not "This is dirty"?  
1	We are both quality time and words surprisingly! I think I am trying to connect through Fi and Te, or understand him and get closer at an intellectual level. 
1	I'm not an ESFJ, but my wife definitely is. She's taken the test multiple times and is a 95% match to the personality which is ridiculous. Anyways I hope [this might help](http://personalityjunkie.com/esfj-type-profile/). This site has been one of the more accurate ones that I've come across.
1	For a year and a half, I (the ENFP) was dating an ESFJ. I broke it off. However, I've been recently reconsidering getting back together. We recently talked about where we failed each other and reflected on what we've learned apart.\n\nPROS: we have absolutely everything in common, like going out on daytrip's, foods, the music we like, holiday celebrations, family, both super super affectionate, love a clean house, etc.., everything in common, even childhood likes and experiences. It is like she dropped from the sky out of a mail order catalog... so much fun. She's also committed to growth and doing whatever it takes to make a relationship work.\n\nCONS: As I have seen on other posts and some sites, she (ESFJ) just can't seem to listen, understand, and connect with my sort of dreamy, artistic ideas, or even just talking about the hard day I've been having. It's like she has to ask 40 questions when I'm just sharing something chill about my day. And the questions sort of seem like an interrogation. Challenging in approach. She is sort of black and white. Also, she is incredibly moody. Hot cold hot cold. I felt like I was walking on eggshells at times because I didn't know who would be walking through the door. And she "couldn't" see her behavior. Says she didn't know she was acting that way. It's like I just can't put my finger on it. She saw me as her best friend, but I couldn't see her as my best friend in the end because it just doesn't seem like I could be myself sometimes. After a while I felt like I irritated her with my sort of ENFP artsy, sharing, spaced outness, even though I always just loved to just listen to her. I also felt like I was giving and giving and getting little back emotionally at times.\n\nI know with the cons it sounds ridiculous that I want to get back together, but when times are good, and she's in a good mood, it is the most fantastic relationship in the world. Knockout!!! I'm really struggling over this. It's so hard to know as someone over 40 where we are to compromise in life and work on communication. Your experiences?\n\nConfused. Am I crazy???\n
1	I absolutely don't think you are crazy! I think gender has a really big role here. Female ESFJs have these tendencies more than males, I think. My (male) ESFJ, really doesn't do the hot/cold thing or ask me 40 questions, BUT I will say that I can relate to not always feeling understood. Sometimes I will have a conversation with him, and he just stares at me and thinks about something, and then moves on to talking about his day!! LOL. He is an internal processor (inferior Ti), so if I say something super logical, he will chew it over and then maybe bring it up the next day and talk about how what I said really helped him at work!! We have the ability to confront one another and ask for our needs to be met, and don't see it as a bad thing that we have to ask. Yes, there are some types Who will understand you more instinctually, but if you can ask for your needs to be met, it definitely can work! \nI also work a pretty serious job (therapist), so I get my needs for deep conversation met pretty regularly. I also try to keep a few friends (including my sister, and other family members) in my inner circle. It helps a lot!
1	My male esfj needs time alone to think! I tend to speak my thoughts out loud...and a lot. He tells me to slow down because I'm going too fast. I've learned to back off until he can come to his conclusions. We both like to cuddle equally, and want to spend equal amounts of time together. Have you taken the love languages test together? It's free online!
0	INTP: ya'll are werid	enough said
14	Woah, you actually decided to say something! Good job!! =P
2	Deep
2	Hah one of my best friends is an ITNP and I think we both feel this way about each other but that's probably what we appreciate most about each other 
1	[deleted]
1	Yeah we are
1	We too are pretty weird. . .
1	ESFJ gifts	Hi ESFJs! INFP here looking for some inspiration. What kind of gifts do you like getting? My ESFJ sister's birthday is coming up and I've no idea what to get her. For context: it's her 30th, she's married and has a one year old boy. She never really talks about things she loves except for sweets, chocolates and wine haha.
2	I mean, if all else fails, then fancy (or not) chocolate/wine is a great gift!! But, personally, I'd just ask her if there's anything she wants or needs? :]\n\nPersonally, I love handmade gifts/cards even if they're small. Maybe a small collage or scrapbook of good memories? \n\nAnd this will sound cheesy, but really anything bought or made with thought is very much appreciated.
1	My ESFJ wife loves elaborate themed gifts, where lots of thought and organizing went into it. It doesnt matter exactly the theme as long as its something you know they like. But get a few things or a bunch of small things and pay attention to presentation. So if I was using Harry Potter as an example, a small wooden box with a gold snitch (a ferrero roche with paper wings attached and folded inside) A scarf with colors or other apparel from the house they would be sorted into. And wrapping paper using their house colors. Using as many details from the theme you are going for. It wows them and shows you care enough to find out all about their interests and take the time to put together something so entertaining and comprehensive. Does not need to be expensive but just show a lot of thought and attention to detail!!!!
5	ESFJ dealing with breakups	Just wondering how you guys handle breakups and how long it takes you to get over them. Little background broke up with an ENTJ (ugh worst breakup ever endured - they are SO cold hearted) and feeling pretty down :(
3	I'm sorry to hear that! *Hugs*\n\nFor me, the best way is to surround myself with friends and/or loved ones if possible. I remember when I had a bad break up way back in high school and I always felt okay at school among my friends and then became sad when I went home. And recently when I broke up with someone, being around my students for the day made me feel so much better. \n\nRegardless, the pain will still be there, and there isn't much more you can do than just accept that it'll suck for a while and move through life anyway. Don't expect to feel fine tomorrow, but you will soon enough!\n\nAlso, nothing wrong with making some yummy snacks!! As long as stress-eating doesn't become a bad habit, food can be a better companian than people temporarily! :P
2	I take breakups very hard. I think its because relationships are our fuel and we LOVE seeing them thrive. \nI have no secret formula for getting over them. I agree with rubis-surround yourself with people who cherish you- ones that will speak truth to you and remind you of your beauty and worth. Because you are exactly who you were before the breakup - beautiful, valued, wanted, intelligent, and cherished. Remembering these things about yourself is important right now because we tend to blame the dissolution of the relationship on ourselves...but its simply NOT completely our faults. Relationships and people are very complex. Give yourself some time and rest. Keep loving others.
2	This is crazy because the same thing happened to me! I was dating a ISTP and we were practically living together. He dropped all contact with me after he called me (mind you, I was going to be home within an hour) to say he wanted to leave! I found out later that day he dropped all contact with me to be with his exgirlfriend again! I am absolutely heartbroken, but as another ESFJ the only way I know how to fell better is to be around people to ease the pain. Being alone sucks! 
1	Thanks for the responses! I am doing much better but I am still shocked at the way entj's handle things! We were engaged and living together and he was able to go from 100 to 0 contact in the span of one fight and me walking out and never talked to me again even though I tried to get him to talk a few times! Best advice I could give to fellow Esfj's is if you are with an Entj make sure you are ready to conform to every single wish, desire and idea because God forbid you want to do something your own way that they don't agree with, they can literally break all ties and leave you in the dark! 
1	ENTP male (18) trying to live with a ESFJ mother, What to do?	Every day is either an argument, or a some form of yelling and screaming at one another. It's not that i have any hatred towards her because i really do love her. But living with her is just constant arguing and is becoming nearly impossible. i know it sounds bad and it makes me upset just saying it, but i am looking forward to leaving for college this year and never returning or speaking to her again. Some of our common issues are her yelling at me to pick up my bedroom 10 to 15 times a day, when the only thing wrong with my room is the shirts are not color organized in the closet, or a gum wrapper is in the corner of the room, or the chair is not perfectly straight under my desk. it literally drives me insane to hear her say it so many times, and worst of all its impossible to get it clean to her standards. second daily issue is me forgetting to do something, even though i have been told 100's of times. for example she always tells me to turn the vent fan on in the bathroom, but no matter what i can never remember to turn it on. i try to tell her that i honestly just cannot remember and that it just slips my mind. Honestly i don't want to make her mad i just forget, But when i tell her this she does not believe me and assumes i am making that up just because i am lazy and want to annoy her. Third issue is her controlling every aspect of my life. she constantly tells me my haircut is ugly and i look stupid and need to get it cut. She will also throw out old shoes and clothes that i like to wear without telling me, because she thinks they are dirty or old. And if i try to wear a pair of old shoes or shorts that don't match my shirt which doesn't bother me at the least, she will yell at me every time to go change or she will not let me leave the house. fourth issue, she thinks i am addicted to smoking pot and drinking. i am a weekend smoker and drinker only. But my mom is taking all my college fund away to try to either send me to rehab, or just because she does not believe i will survive in college without getting more "addicted" to pot. let me point out i have a 4.42 weighted GPA, 3.9 unweighted, leaving high school with 53 college credit hours, third in my class out of 300, and founder and president of relay for life at my school were we raised over $5,000 dollars last year. So her constantly calling me an addict and a failure at life pisses me off to no end. her quote "Only dumbasses are third in the class". fifth daily issue, she loves to find issues in my life, and then uses them to ground me. it has caused me to develop anxiety and paranoia. if i leave my phone on the counter she will take it to her room, lock her self away with it and spend 4-5 hours reading every last message, looking and every picture, opening every app even reddit and reading old comments i posted from years ago to throw in my face as chance to ground me. she also becomes very emotional when she finds things on my phone same with my computer. i also cannot sit in my room in privacy, she will pick the lock multiple times a day just to ask me what i'm doing. and if there is any uncertainty in my voice she will ask me to hand her my phone so she can look at it. i also cannot make phone calls, because she will hide outside my door to listen to every last word i say. and every time her excuse is "i was just walking by and heard something odd". 6th common issue, she thinks i have no remorse for my actions, and need to go to a psychiatrist. when just like i tell her every time, i do feel bad i'm just not good at showing you. But again she says that's crazy and stupid everyone shows remorse and that i need serious help. 7th issue, she has taken control of my bank account. where she monitors every dollar i take out, asking where i spent it or why i needed it. all this money is from the part time job i work. 8th problem is her basing everything i do now as an adult on actions i took in kindergarten or any young age for that matter. she will say things like "i have been dealing with you since you were born. beating kids up, always getting in trouble in school", she will basically try and guilt trip me for things i did as a toddler and have no recollection of. and this really bothers me. because it never has any relevance to the situation at hand. \n\n\noverall i do not want this to come across as i hate my mother, or think she is crazy. because i know she does all this to protect me because she truly loves me, and i love her too. But i just can't take the daily screaming and fights we get into over the most petty things. my goal here is to see if any other ENTP kids and ESFJ mothers have found a way to get past these differences and live in harmony, and if so can you share any tips you have or ways of explaining my self to her so she will understand me better. because i do not want to never come home or visit, but at this point the anxiety i get from having to live in constant fear of being scrutinized every day is to much. Thanks for reading all this if you took the time!
1	Honestly, I don't think this has anything to do with ENTP vs ESFJ.  It sounds like your mother is potentially a narcissist and is trying to control your life.  You love her, that's great, but she's not treating you like an 18 year old person about to make their way in the world.  Have you visited [raised by narcissits](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/)?  I would be immediately looking into ways to separate yourself from her physically and especially financially.  Can you move into a friend or relative's basement until you head to college?
1	As a 19yo intp with an esfj mom i can relate. They are easy to get along with when your lifestyle matches their expectations. All you have to do is make then laugh a bit and be nice then you can get away with the small stuff. if you look into hee underlying fears or bad traumas about men, she might've attached them to you. So basically imagine the what she wants you to be like, act like that person until you gain her trust and you'll have more freedoms.\n

1	Come chat about Personality Theory	Hey everyone! I'm from a Discord server focused around personality typology, emphasis on MBTI but with lots of talk about Jungian theory, socionics, and enneagram as well. We're over a year old, have a nice bot that does things for us like channel and role management, and would like to open the gates to newcomers so we can all have fun. What makes us different than most other Discord servers is that we're more focused on actual discussion and conversation with minimal shitposting (we keep that in the #nsfw channel). With that in mind, please join if you want to discuss Jungian theory, get people to try to figure out your type, want to debate the merits of Socionics vs MBTI, discuss the deeper meaning of your Enneagram, or just want to have a good talk.\n\nSee you there (:\n\nhttps://discord.gg/6xE4qMt Edit: If that link expires, use this one: https://discord.gg/ct8BRps
0	Last year I was ENFJ	
2	Were you strongly N last year or was it pretty much on the fence then too? Since I found out about MBTI in November I've been testing as an INTP but with the T being only barely dominant (55-60%) and then one time it wound up being only 49% resulting in a score of INFP. I'm pretty sure I'm still an INTP deep down but circumstances have been pushing me towards the F because I was in an emotionally difficult situation.
2	To all the ESFJ girls out there, what do you think of ISTP men. Would you ever date one, and why?	Some famous ISTPs include Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford, Vladimir Putin, Erwin Rommel, Scarlett Johansson, Melania Trump, Snoop Dog, Tom Cruise, Christian Bale, Daniel Craig, Bruce Lee, Kirsten Stewart, Simon Cowl, and Steve jobs.
2	I'm gonna have to go with probably not. It might work out for a while, but in the long run I don't think I could handle it. I thrive on consistency. 
2	I'm currently with a INTP and /u/peppermint-kiss is right. We are polar opposites but we balance each other out. He will go out and socialize because it makes me happy, I'll come earlier from a bar with friends to spend time with him at home. We push each other to do the things that we should do but don't/can't.\n\nHowever, she's also right about the confrontation bit too. There are a lot of time where I wish he would go out without feeling wildly uncomfortable,  or enjoy having people over and we butt heads around that. He also loves to play devil's advocate and in the beginning it drove me mad!\n\nBut the truth is every year I love him more and more. I started dating him as a fling, that was about 4 years ago. Dating an "I", especially as reserved as an INTP, having him feel completely open and free is the best feeling ever. The love and loyalty that it brings is worth ever fight, bicker, and hurt.
1	ESFJ x ISTP is one of the best relationship combinations.  It's called a relationship of semi-duality.  You have her dominant function as your inferior and vice versa.  This leads to a lot of personal development and magnetic attraction.  Note that it is often a quite tumultuous relationship (fights are not uncommon), but that it's one of the most stable - you keep coming back together.  That keeps you growing and keeps you interested.  Relationships of semi-duality are often likened to being a "moth to the flame".  The relationships get stronger and more loving the longer they go on.  Highly recommended.\n\nBtw I'm ENFJ in case you were wondering. :)  I just want to commend you on noticing the attraction of semi-duality.  A lot of people (as you can see evinced by the other response) don't instinctively realize how good of a match it is, for various reasons.
1	I think it depends on how mature both individuals are and if you're both understanding enough to accept and work through each other's differences. \n\nI'm an ISTP male and I dated an ESFJ female before. Personally, it didn't work out for us because we couldn't quite get past our differences. \n\nNot saying it can't work for anyone else though. 
1	I'm an ESFJ and I'm married to an ISTP! \n\nWe were friends for a year or so, and I would have NEVER imagined dating him. We were so different and I found him a bit annoying ha! \n\nI picked up on his willingness to serve others and his loyalty, and we began dating. Boy, was that a crazy and fun time! Our differences were so strong, and I always being so uncertain, that I was constantly overthinking whether we were "supposed to be together." \n\nWell, finally he wore me down and I married him 😉\n\nI agree with everything that has been said. We REALLY have to be thoughtful about our communication and who the other person is, because it's so so easy for him to upset me, or me to frustrate him. \n\nWe definitely have to genuinely appreciate our differences, and help each other grow. I'm so excited for the future experience of parenting with him! It will be a new challenge, but also an opportunity for us to complement one another on a whole new level! 
5	ESFJ Personality type & career choice.	Hello everyone. Im 17 and I will be soon graduating high school.\nAs most of ESFJ's i like artistic stuff and caring for others and i got to say i have a pretty hard time choosing between these two fields in terms of choosing a job for me.\n\nHeres some background story of my life:\nWhen I was in primary school i got bullied quite a lot. It made me withdraw from social life, and stick to a very little circle of friends. At that time I learned by myself how to draw, and  i got to say as the time went on, i got very good at it. I tought of becoming an architect or some kind of designer when I will grow up. But when i hit 13 I got an idea of creating youtube channel. For the first time in my life i started  to speak openly, loudly, with no shame or fear, which became insanely empovering, and i experienced a great sense of joy from this form of art which was creating videos . It also affected my social life in middle school - it became very easy for me to socialize, read and understand peoples feelings, and even speak in front of big crowds. Then some stuff happedned to me in life which basically leaded me to withdraw from social life more than ever, and as i started to get my sh*t together, I started feeling some sense of desire to teach and help other people. I started thinking about becoming a doctor.\nAs i took the MBTI test, and started understanding my actions i took till that point in life, i began realizing i had a little bit of a doctor in myself trought my whole life, for example by always picking some support/medic type character while playing videogames with friends, and caring for the "weaker ones" at school. Also I was always easily catching any medical theories, and basically i liked to learn how human body works.\n\nThat's it. Now I have to say, that I feel I would rather like to become a  doctor than some kind of an architect or filmmaker, because I feel I need caring for others, and love in my life way more than creating stuff. Idea of this job gives me some sense of "emotional independence" - I don't feel like i would have to keep chasing after girls as i did troughout big part of my life, because my emotional needs would be fulfiled with that job. I can add here that im probably Enneagram type 2. I also feel like even though i have some talents in artistic field, creating drains me out of some kind of "emotianal energy" more than it gives to me.\nI know im not scared of blood and i can control myself in emergency situations, but i have readed a lot, that ESFJ's are very sensitive - too sensitive, to get trough rough med school, and too sensitive to make tough decisions which can affect their patients health trough the rest of his life. I can also see how this sensitivity affects my life - it's very hard for me sometimes to motivate myself, and im generally not a disciplined person.\nAlso I can't understand how could such change in character happen: in primary school I would definitely decribe myself as introverted. Now im extraverted as hell.\n\nI know nobody else, but me can pick myself a career, but I would like you to share your thoughts about things I have written, and if you as ESFJ's have some experience with these career fields, please say a little about it\n\nAt the end I would like to apologize if my English wasn't perfect, but it's not my native language :v\n\nThanks for reading!
1	You should still take the medical school route. You may find something you like that is medically related and helpful to others that doesn't involve immediate life and death. Perhaps looking into nutrition, medical research or nursing. So many options.  Discipline can be learned and life will toughen you up. Go for it. Figure out the first step and take a leap of faith.
1	>I don't feel like i would have to keep chasing after girls as i did troughout big part of my life, because my emotional needs would be fulfiled with that job.\n\nOff the bat, I feel the need to tell you that you should never look to work to replace meaningful human connection. You'll only be disappointed. That being said, that doesn't mean your job should be meaningless. It is clear you like the in your face adrenaline/joy of helping others. Might I also suggest looking into being a fireman? I have several friends who are firemen, and they get more medical calls than actual fires. And the whole part of being a doctor, the aftercare, diagnosis, etc. the hard part basically, is not put on you. You get to give them immediate help, without the "responsibility" or liability of being a doctor or a nurse. Whatever you choose, make sure it makes you happy. And also, just because this is what you pick now, doesn't mean this is what you have to do for the rest of your entire life. Young people tend to be short-sighted when it comes to picking a career. Maybe do the medical thing now when you're young and vibrant, and maybe you can do the architect thing later in life. If you're in school, try talking to your guidance counselor (if you school has something like that). Or just another trusted adult. It's always best when ESFJ's TALK out their decisions. You don't even always know what you want until it just pops out of your mouth during a conversation.
1	I just realized today I should consider athletic or performance coaching. I was cheering on a friend who feels really sensitive about exercising and is just getting back into it. It felt really good to be giving him true and real advice (the more you put effort into something, the more you will want to come back to it- it's true it's like a drug in your brain. it has to do with subconscious mental engagement). I could totally see myself being really happy, watching people get better and better at stuff and challenging themselves and feeling good about themselves because that's exactly what I like to see. Social sciences interest me especially in its application so that could be another reason why I find the role of a coach appealing. My personality dictates the "happy seeing others grow" part.
1	I think your thoughts on going to the medical school is a good choice. Although ESFJ is sensitive, they are also very good at take care of other people, which made medicare or other related jobs a good fit for them. ESFJs emphasize order and hierarchy in their lives, and don’t mind working on projects that involve repetitive or monotonous tasks. They are generally reliable, and thrive in places with clearly laid out rules and structures. ESFJ personality types are often great in administrative roles because of their natural aversion to conflict, their love of order, and their practical skills. Some Common [ESFJ careers](https://good.co/esfj-personality-type/) include:Social Work;Medical Care; Personal Accounting; Teaching; Non-profits. \nYou've already made a very clear point on only you could pick yourself a career. Wish you good luck:))
10	Ever wondered how many subscribers there are in each of the MBTI subreddits? Well I collected the data in this post. Tell me your interpretation of the results.	general MBTI subreddit: 14,701\n\nall SJs: 8,137 // \nESTJ: 745 // \nESFJ: 732 // \nISTJ: 4,055 // \nISFJ: 2,605\n\nall SPs: 8,137 // \nESTP: 920 // \nESFP: 804 // \nISTP: 4,447 // \nISFP: 2,205\n\nall NFs: 56,097 // \nENFP: 11,243 // \nENFJ: 3,016 // \nINFP: 22,166 // \nINFJ: 19,672\n\nall NTs: 75,270 // \nENTP: 9,400 // \nENTJ: 4,167 // \nINTP: 31,444 // \nINTJ: 30,259\n\nCompare the numbers with this estimated frequency of personality types: https://mypersonality.info/personality-types/population-gender/\n\nNote: I'll be posting this on all of the MBTI subreddits.\n
9	When I first learned about MBTI, the S/N was described to me as:\n\nWhen you are getting directions to drive somewhere S's prefer use of visual cues (turn right at the big blue barn and then immediately onto the curvy road NOT STRAIGHT) while N's prefer verbal direction (turn west onto State St and then take the left fork onto the trafficway).\n\nThus my thought is that the S's are more likely to spend time on Facebook or Instagram, where you get the quick picture, visual side of things... Then there's the N's who prefer Reddit, where people like to spend time with more concrete verbiage and interaction.
6	A short video summary of the ESFJ personality type	Hey ESFJs, :)\nI am an ENTP and I am creating short video summaries for each type as a side-project.\nEven though I think - you are the guys who are least likely to be interested in the MBTI theory - I thought I'd let you know that I just released your video ;)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/iRYBKdKsu2s\n\nI really love reading feedbacks so let me know what you think!\nEnjoy! :)\n\n\n
2	I enjoyed this! It seemed pretty spot on for me.
3	Intj f looking for advice for friend Esfj m	Hello all. It's my first time posting in this subreddit, but let me start by saying that I've a couple of esfj friends and they're both very dear to me. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo sadly, tomorrow will mark a year since my esfjs friends' father died of heart problems. The memory of the day he called me about the news still haunts me.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt's been over a month since I kept thinking about this date coming up because I want to say something to him (since he'll most definitely spend tomorrow thinking about that horrible event). I was thinking of sending him a funny video (he loves family guy) and give him a message saying something that'll remember him that his friends got his back but without being a downer (if I'm making any sense). Idk, I feel like as a friend I should acknowledge this so that he doesn't feel alone in this kind of heavy moment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo my question to you all is this...how should I tell him that his friends are there for him for support in a way that cheers him up rather than make him sad? (I hope I'm not overthinking this haha..) Thanks in advance
3	I am an ESFJ and I lost my brother a few years back. I always appreciate people bringing it up because it shows me how much they care. They love me enough to remember this event, the date, that I might be effected. And overall, I think ESFJ's prefer it to be happy rather than sad. We like to be sad on our own. So you can do something as simple as a text, "Hey, thinking about you today. Hope you know how much we all love you, and we're here for you for whatever you need." Also, I appreciate distraction. If you guys are close (like, live in the same state) I always enjoy a good kidnapping. You can plan it or not, but just swing by and pick them up. Say, hey, this is what we're doing today. Go to the movies (making sure it's a funny movie with no death in it) go mini-golfing, just do something fun and active. Theme park. Something like that. My very good friend kidnaps me every year on the anniversary. And she's so subtle about it, will ask me WEEKS in advance if I'm free that day. Sometimes it doesn't even occur to me till the day arrives that that's what she's doing. I can't tell you how much I appreciate the thought, effort, execution. Actions really do speak louder than words. Especially in these kinds of situations. Hope this helps!
1	They seem to like to remember positive memories so maybe send him a video or photos of good times you've had together?
2	Sup! You guys (girls mainly?) are still missing here.	
1	There's an equal number of males and females of each type, or at least, all the studies that purported to show different numbers were unscientific and not reliable.
3	Any ISTP and ESFJ relationship out there?	I would appreciate some stories or advice 😊 thankyou!!!
2	My wife and I. We've been married for 5 years now. I'm an ISTP, she is an ESFJ. There are definitely some rough spots, but we make it work.
1	My mother is ESFJ and her husband is ISTP.  They've managed to stay together, whereas she usually runs men off fairly quickly with her extremely controlling, manipulative nature. He's sort of immune to it all so doesn't mind. \n\nI think ISTPs are patient and tolerant enough to manage an ESFJ relationship. 
1	[wouldn't recommend](http://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Semi-duality)
1	thats like exact opposite haha\noppisties do attract tho ;)\n
1	I'm an istp female currently separated from an esfj male. We butted heads A LOT. I am very direct, love new things, and couldn't really deal with his flirtatious nature. He on the other hand, loved anything familiar (total mummy boy), routine, crappy tv - a simple life. It just wasn't very much stimulation for me and I found my head wandering away when he came home and all he could talk about was the office gossip. I'm impatient and he didn't really ever deal with things efficiently. I'm not sure about anyone else but do ESFJs have a tendency to moan about their problems a lot and never do anything about it? I found myself rolling my eyes a lot. \n\nAnd he loved to be centre of attention, jokes at his own expense, my expense and he could exaggerate and lie quite a lot. Yeah, my respect for the guy kind of dwindled away..... 
5	Personality V. Favorite Color	I have no ESFJ responses and I didn't want to exclude you guys from the survey, so if you'd take the time to take this super short survey, that'd be great!\n\nhttps://www.esurveycreator.com/s/c49fbd7
1	TiNe here. So, do you like dancing?	
1	[GIFV link](https://i.imgur.com/JLAeOO6.gifv)\n\n---\n\n_^I ^am ^a ^bot. ^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/livven/wiki/gifv-bot) ^// ^[code](https://github.com/Livven/GifvBot)_
1	salsa classes are probably full of ESFJs
18	INTP here... why are there so many INTPs here?	I was curious about this sub because there was this one ESFJ I've met and she literally confused the fuck out of me- not intentionally, but for a week I kept wondering why she acted the way she did and stuff. Usually I think I don't get much personal interaction with SF's, let alone an ESFJ.  \nAnyways, why the hell are there so many other INTP's lurking the sub xD. I don't have a problem with it, but... actually yeah I have a fucking problem with it- WHY?!?!?!?!??!?!  \nCLAIM YO LAND, ESFJs! CLAIM YO LAND!  \nOh wait... that's exactly what makes the difference- us INTP's are lurking here feeding our brains while you ESFJ's are out in real life accomplishing and claiming shit.
39	Let's be honest, INTPs lurk everywhere\n\n-INTP
9	Also, for some reason INTP/J seem to love themselves some ESFJ's. They seem to come here the most asking for help trying to understand us. And like you said, while you guys sit here looking for answer, we just straight up ask you about it.\n\nSource: I'm with an INTP.
6	I came here to see how the other half lives
5	For the same reason that ESFJs lurk on r/intp: to observe the other side of the coin.
3	Maybe this is stereotypical but ESFJs are pretty social and normal so there probably aren't many who associate much with talking to strangers on the internet lmaoo
2	i'm subscribed to all mbti types' subs
2	Yes all the ESFJ's are out being social and not lurking on the internet. Oh well we'll lurk for them\n
2	Survey time, MBTI and mistyping	Hello there ESFJs, I got [a little survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdbMCVJtxW8_DDlIwATOuzmT4FqovO3xILsj9m24uxWx1LvIA/viewform?c=0&w=1) for everyone to fill out. I'm curious to see which types most likely mistype as what other types, and so far I haven't got any answer from the ESFJs. If you would all be so nice to fill it out that would be awesome, I'll post the "results" on /r/mbti as soon as I feel like I've gotten enough answers if anyone is curious. Enjoy.\n\nEdit: Now with link to the survey!
2	I mistyped as everything under the sun until I got over the anti-ESFJ bias enough to seriously consider it. Everyone seems to assume all the people they know who are clingy, emotional, and pushy must be ESFJ.\n\nBtw, it says closed for maintenance?
1	fill out what? you're not posting any link
1	How do you plan to account for people who deliberately and persistently lie and misrepresent themselves?\n\nOn /r/INTP there is a [70% mistyping rate](http://www.72archetypes.com/wiki/XeeleesOnINTP). 20 percentile points of that are people who do it deliberately in order to fuck with the type they're misrepresenting. Then another chunk does it in order to get the fuck away from the type that's doing the lying evil.\n\n/r/ENTP meanwhile is infested with narcissists schmoozing to get close to their targets. They also enjoy lying and deception even if they don't love lying evil for its own sake.\n\nYour asking people about mistypes makes it so you'll catch the "oh hey, they made a mistake" rather than "I am evil, watch me fuck you over". And while the former category is indeed larger than the latter category, they're not the same types.\n\nSo by voluntarily asking for people's type mistakes you'll never figure out who is lying. You're basically counting on people who say "trust us, we're honest" to be honest.
3	If an INTP were to write a song for ESFJ it would be this	
2	Why do you hate us so badly???	INTP here 
9	No hate here, as I am in a long term relationship with one.
8	I'm INTP and hate ourselves too. We are just so lazy and nerdy :/
7	Do I look fat in this?
5	they don't
3	oh dear. Allow me to express my displeasure. On top of that, it seems your post hasn't exactly warranted popularity, as you have now triggered a defensive response from the party you have accused of holding some rancorous disposition. Please reconsider yourself next time, and perhaps one could reconcile the embarassment through other means.
2	The reason I don't believe in mbti theory any more is because I know too many people that identify as ESFJ and they're all so different...some of them I truly cannot stand and some of them I really like.  That's the problem with theory....it isn't fact. \n\nThe reason intuitives don't like you (from an ENFJ perspective) is that *some* ESFJ like to control people, constantly seek attention and affirmation, resort to manipulation, and are way too caught up in outward appearance of how their life looks to other people. They want the admiration of others. ESFJ can be straight up nuts and most of the ones I know have falling outs with so many people in their life and it doesn't surprise me honestly.  BUT then...some of the esfj I know are so sweet, so, I don't know what to make of ESFJ type any more. 
2	Esfj women are jealous of ENFJ... the only type of women that don't like me are ESTJ and ESFJ.  Lol

4	[Survey] 800+ Respondents on MBTI Relationships/Friendships Survey - Check Out the Results and Contribute!	Hey there, ESFJs (and non-ESFJ lurkers)! A few months ago, my good friend /u/ashirviskas developed an MBTI Relationships Survey to determine which MBTI Types had the best relationships with which types, what each of the genders rated their ongoing/terminated relationships, how their intertype friendships fare, etc.  By chance, I happened to see this guy post the survey in /r/intj asking for some input for the presentation of his results, and so I’ve been helping him out with it since then… and this is what we’ve come up with (so far)!  We invite you to tell us how your relationship with your Duals, Mirrors, etc., fare in this relationship survey! \n\n&nbsp; \n&nbsp;\n\n**[Link to Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScTCIkcxO30RBnpXQIGXV0xaRqj5LFytF_LPmE-DdrD9-qSoA/viewform?c=0&w=1)**\n\n**[Link to Survey Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yFpUbw92VH_BGrVf-FMngyCdtERYVvvGOEL_T58kw9Q)**\n\n&nbsp; \n&nbsp;\n\n**About the Survey:**\n\nAll together, the survey is going to ask you about 1-2 romantic relationships (current and former, as well as duration), and 1-3 friendships.  It’s okay if you haven’t been in a relationship! We’d still love to receive your feedback based on your friendships/relationships with other types… if you’re not 100% sure about your friends’ or past/current S.O. types, try to give a best guess as to what their type might be (unsure is an option for friendships, but this isn’t as useful for finding correlations in the data).  \n\n&nbsp; \n\nIf you’re not confident about doing this, maybe try asking the person to take the test (a good quality cognitive functions test, rather than “preferences” tests that can be rather inaccurate), or read about the 8 cognitive functions… and see which ones the person most likely uses as their dom/aux configuration; an assessment on the inferior (which can result in the “grip”) or your “stressor” function might be useful as well. \n\n&nbsp; \n&nbsp;\n\n**Personal Biases and Stereotyping:**\n\nTry to remove personal biases that you may have regarding other people in your current (and past) life! It’s not helpful to us (or to you) if you stereotype or inaccurately categorize people (i.e. *“I dislike Person X because they’re so literal; they must be a Sensing Type”*, since Intuiting types can be prone to such behavior as well), resulting in a lower rating for a given person/type.  \n\n&nbsp; \n&nbsp;\n\nBe honest with yourself, even if this results in a rating that contradicts your initial beliefs/biases in the system; the truth is what matters the most in the end!  If you think you’d want help judging on what someone’s type may be in your life, I can try to help you out a little bit...  but, try to decide this for yourself/do good quality research and analyzing first! Some stereotypes that should be eliminated:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Not all Sensors are **poor at (or can't handle) abstract or philosophical conversations**, and not all Intuiting types are **unrealistic, impractical, and disconnected from reality**.  There is simply a preference for one or the other (and perhaps an imbalance in some)! And, on a related note, not all smart people are **Intuiting types**, and not all dumb people are **Sensing types** (or vice versa)!\n\n* Not all Feelers are **illogical and irrational**, and not all Thinkers are **cold and detached**.  For instance, being irrational can involve *absurd, inconsistent logic*, and sometimes being reasonable involves a **practical and fair** approach that requires *considering other people's feelings*.  A reasonable person will use both aspects to make sound, balanced decisions, but will typically prefer one over the other in a "tiebreaker" between the two. Not considering or actively disregarding one or the other is not superior in any way; this is just immaturity (in some regard) expressing itself!\n\n* Not all extroverts are **loud and obnoxious**, and not all introverts are **antisocial recluses that never talk**.  Being sociable isn't always the trait of an extrovert, and being socially anxious isn't always the trait of an introvert.  Also - some extroverts will not find conventional social affairs very energizing and stimulating; it can depend on the group of people for extroverts just as well as introverts.  Look into the cognitive functions!!! I cannot emphasize this enough.\n\n* Not all judging types are **overly rigid, rule abiding, and "stick up the ass" kinds**, and not all perceiving types are **chaotic, lackadaisical, and scatterbrained fools**.  We all have judging and perceiving functions, all of which can be prone to a form of narrow mindedness or disconnectedness.\n\n&nbsp; \n&nbsp; \n\nThe cognitive functions are supposed to educate us on how people introspect/reflect on things (introversion), and also how they interact with the environment (extroversion); how is a person interacting with their environment, and what kinds of biases do they try to mentally remove (introverted functions usually eliminate *environmental biases*, and extroverted functions usually eliminate *personal biases* in their respective domains)? \n\n&nbsp; \n&nbsp; \n\n*Remember: we're all going to have traits that are introverted, and some that are extroverted in their expression! It's a matter of which ones will be this way... this should also be used as a guide to eliminate any ambiguity with regard to this orientation (thus, people start believing they're an "ambivert" - a term I personally cannot agree with)*.\n\n&nbsp; \n\nIf your family members are being considered as one of your friends for this survey, that’s fine too; any relationship will do, provided that you know them on a personal basis (since strictly going off of someone’s “professional” face may be not only counterproductive for this survey, but detrimental in your personal relationship(s) with that person[s] ).\n\n&nbsp; \n&nbsp;\n\n**Socionics Users:** \n\nRemember to convert j→P and p→J for Introverts.  All of the data pertaining to the intertype relationships have already been converted to the MBTI system. For convenience, the system equivalents are placed below!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The NTs:**\n\nMBTI | Socionics | Sociotype\n---|---|----\nINTJ | INTp | ILI\nENTJ | ENTj | LIE\nINTP | INTj | LII\nENTP | ENTp | ILE\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The SFs:**\n\nMBTI | Socionics | Sociotype\n---|---|----\nESFP | ESFp | SEE\nISFP | ISFj | ESI\nESFJ | ESFj | ESE\nISFJ | ISFp | SEI\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The NFs:**\n\nMBTI | Socionics | Sociotype\n---|---|----\nINFJ | INFp | IEI\nENFJ | ENFj | EIE\nINFP | INFj | EII\nENFP | ENFp | IEE\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The SPs:**\n\nMBTI | Socionics | Sociotype\n---|---|----\nESTP | ESTp | SLE\nISTP | ISTj | LSI\nESTJ | ESTj | LSE\nISTJ | ISTp | SLI\n\n&nbsp; \n&nbsp;\n\n**Final Notes:**\n\nSome of the changes that we want to make aren’t yet implemented in the Google Sheets version - but hopefully this will change soon enough! Survey Participation, feedback/general commentary on the results, etc., are all highly sought after! We’d love to hear from you!\n\n&nbsp; \n&nbsp;\n\n**Current roles for this project:**\n\n/u/ashirviskas: the original survey developer and secondary google sheets maintenance\n\n/u/snugglybearsama: primary google sheets document 1-(wo)man maintenance crew (data organization, formatting, formula developer, etc.)\n\n/u/kun42: performed a wilson confidence interval on the survey data, and has a lot of statistical charts currently available on his blog for the survey data.  Check it out! https://www.man42.net/blog/2016/11/mbti-relationship-stats/\n\n&nbsp; \n&nbsp;\n\nIf you want to PM any of us regarding a given topic, use these roles as a general guide.  Currently, I’m the most active and involved of the three, so if you want to talk about other stuff with any of us, I'd be the most available!
1	**3. Feedback Sought After**\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nWe are currently (and very actively) looking for some feedback, including ideas/suggestions on new data points that are simply not listed or unintentionally omitted without an explanation, data points that could be compiled that aren’t (as of yet), etc. \n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Charts**\n\nThis is one of the main things that will need a good amount of time to implement.  There are plenty of charts found in the excel version that I have in my possession; however, Google Sheets didn’t render them properly (surprised? I’m not).  As a result, the entire charting process needs to be taken back to the drawing board… I had some really cool double-sided bar charts for male vs female comparisons made and everything.  What a shame!\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Mobile Users**\n\nAs of 1/1/2017, this document isn’t very mobile friendly; this file is TREMENDOUS.  There are a lot of calculations being done on this Google Sheets document (I mean, thousands of them on the “General, All Types” tab alone, not to mention the “individual type analysis” tab...). Eventually, I would like to make a more mobile friendly version of this, which would simply import a lot of the data instead of doing the calculations directly on the document (if that would make it faster… I’m no programming expert!)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Sexual Orientation**\n\nAs of 1/1/2017, I haven’t really done much to perform calculations on the basis of sexual orientation.  This wasn’t a very high priority for me to be honest (my apologies), since I thought that for now, having the genders was sufficient.  The calculations required for this were attempted a while ago along with gender and types, but they became overwhelming and very intense, making the document nearly impossible to open and maintain.  \n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nI’m unfortunately not well versed in pivot tables, which would make this (along with other data points) much more attainable.  If anyone is able to create something like this for the survey data [or could share some really good pointers - does Google Sheets even have this feature?], that’d be splendid (and I’d love to learn)!\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Volunteers**\n\nFor the most part, I’ve been doing this stuff by myself (since /u/ashirviskas has a lot of school work, and /u/kun42 focused on doing statistics for his blog on this survey)… I’m sort of in over my head at this point, and I’ve slowed down on implementing the content we want on there considerably due to how overwhelming the work I’m assigning myself can be.  \n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nIf anyone wants to actively participate in making changes, suggestions, etc., I’m all for ideas and such! I would really like to work on getting well over 1,000+ (aspiring for over 2,000+... let me dream) responses on this survey (easily achieved), and implementing some charts.  I think there’s a lot of interesting data and insights that can be found in the results… I’d love to have someone to collaborate with on a regular basis about this stuff! I don’t bite, I promise… PM us if you’re interested (I know I am!).
1	**2. Document Table of Contents/Structure**\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Survey Responses**\n\nThe raw survey responses - self-explanatory (hopefully!). Contains filters for the purposes of debugging, as well as examining data not organized into one of the other tabs of the document.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Overview (in the works as of 1/1/2017)**\n\nGives an overview of Gender, Type, Socionics, and Temperament survey results. Includes a vast majority of the charts on the document [charts not readily available on Google Sheets version - import from xlsx wasn’t so streamlined and nicely executed]. Compiles information from the “General, All Types”, “Gender”, and “Temperaments” Tabs, and presents them in paragraph format.\n   \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Introduction_References (in the works as of 10/25/2016)**\n\nGives a general overview of the concept of MBTI/Socionics (and will also give readers a general idea of the extent of knowledge/competence we the composers have), as well as explaining various things throughout the rest of the document.\n   \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**General, All Types**\n\nSummarizes survey data on the basis of individual type; mostly consists of semi-organized and compiled, yet unrefined data. Is used as a reference for other sheets, particularly the “In-Depth Analysis” and “Overview” Tabs.\n   \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Gender**\n\nSummarizes survey data on the basis of each gender for the types; consists of semi-organized and compiled, yet unrefined data.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n*NOTE: The issue of gender-type-relationship duration configurations was separated from “General, All Types” due to the calculation intensive output that would have occurred if each rater-type-gender-duration and ratee-type-gender-duration calculation was performed; this resulted in a table that was well over 15,000 rows long, and made the document excessively slow in a previous version (not to mention extremely cumbersome to navigate). Thus, the creation of the Gender Tab came into existence! We apologize if an intensive gender analysis is a highly sought after data point…*\n   \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n*NOTE 2: There is a gender assessment being worked on, and has been included in the “General, All Types” and “Overview” tabs…! Not yet implemented in the individual type analysis tab.*\n   \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Temperaments (in the works as of 10/25/2016)**\n\nSummarizes survey data on the basis of the various temperament groupings presented in the “Introduction_References” Tab.\n   \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Individual Type Analysis**\n\nSummarizes survey data on the basis of the individual type selected. Will be more type specific (and eventually more intensive as a result) than the data presented in the other tabs. \n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n*NOTE: This tab hasn’t been updated in awhile, but will eventually include a temperaments and gender based analysis such as what is found in the “Overview” Tab...!*\n   \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Socionics (NEW and in the works as of 12/27/2016)**\n\nOrganizes survey data on the basis of the socionics intertype dynamics. Gender based data is being worked on as well...!
1	**1. Data Point Values Sample List**\n\nSome of the data points we’ve put together and presented for you throughout the document (will apply to both friendships and romantic relationships) are as follows:\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**I. Individual Type Data Points**\n\n* Which type(s) give out the best ratings? The worst?\n* Which type(s) received the best ratings? The worst?\n* How frequently does your type date a given personality type? How does your type fare in the world of love?!\n* What is the relationship duration bracket distribution for each type?\n* Which type(s) make the best friends overall? The worst?\n* Which type(s) get along best with each other in their friendships? As a whole?\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**II. Gender Data Points**\n\n* What is the overall gender distribution for each type? Which gender/type dominates the participant pool?\n* Which type has the most dominant Male Population? Female? Other Genders?\n* What is the sexual preference distribution for each type? \n* Which gender rates their relationships the best? The worst?\n* Which gender receives the best ratings in their relationships? The worst?\n* What is the relationship duration bracket distribution for each gender?\n* Which gender rates their friends in a more generous manner? [Reverse not available]\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**III. Temperament Data Points (this section is very heavily in the works as of 10/25/2016, and continuing as of 1/1/2016)** \n\n* What is the overall distribution of survey respondents when grouping the types by... \n 1. The Kiersey Temperaments (NF, NT, SJ, SP)? \n 2. The Perceiving Functions (NP, NJ, SJ, SP)? \n 3. The Judging Functions (FP, FJ, TJ, TP)? \n 4. Their Introversion/Extroversion Orientation/Preference (IP, IJ, EJ, EP)?\n\n* What is the overall distribution of the temperaments rated in their friendships and relationships (defined as “ratees”) *[NOTE: not a real word... oh well!]*?\n* Which Groupings have the best relationship compatibility with each other? \n* Which Grouping Method puts out the best results in terms of relationship compatibility?\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**IV. Socionics/Intertype Relationship Dynamics (NEW as of 12/27/2016)**\n\n* What is the most commonly relationship dynamic rated in the survey? Least Common?\n* What is the most highly rated relationship dynamic in the survey? Lowest?\n* How do the genders assign their relationships with the various intertype dynamics? How does gender play a role in these dynamics?
1	**ESFJs:** You're currently very grossly underrepresented in the survey data! As of 1/4/2017, there are 3 respondents that were reported as being ESFJ.  I'd like to hear from more of you guys, and see things from your perspective! I'd really appreciate it if you could just take a moment of your time to give us feedback on your relationships with other types... thank you for stopping by!
1	Generally speaking, these are current distributions for the different temperaments for those who rated romantic relationships [as defined by MBTI). As you can see (as of 1/4/2017), some of them are grossly underrepresented (there seems to be some rounding errors/deviations here... keep that in mind)!\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Kiersey (NT, NF, SJ, SP):**\n\nNT | NF | SJ | SP\n---|---|----|----\n38.0% | 31.5% | 14.1% | 16.3%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Perceiving (NP, NJ, SJ, SP):**\n\nNP | NJ | SJ | SP\n---|---|----|----\n39.2% | 30.1% | 14.2% | 16.4%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Judging (FP, FJ, TJ, TP):**\n\nFP | FJ | TJ | TP\n---|---|----|----\n32.3% | 23.1% | 21.0% | 23.6%\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**MBTI I/E**\n\nIP | IJ | EJ | EP\n---|---|----|----\n31.2% | 30.1% | 12.8% | 25.9%\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere's an exaggerated/skewed number of introverted intuitive types; we're attempting to collect more data on the types listed above! But, of course - all types are more than welcome to partake in the survey; we're just in high need of certain groups for a more fair representation!
1	When you give someone a greeting card as a gift, how do you seal it?	Assuming the card is not going through the mail, and it may or may not have cash/gift card included.\n\nDo/would you seal the whole envelope, seal part of it, or do you not seal it at all?\n\nI included a poll so we can see results. http://www.strawpoll.me/11949564
3	What's your opinion of INTP's?	I'd like to know as the complete polar opposite of my personality type.
11	I would be remiss if I didn't remind you that MBTI is a broad template from which to understand people. There is more variation in each type than pedophiles in the Catholic Church. \n\nHi, I'm an INTP. You may remember me from such professions as engineering and programming. I would part the red sea for your tribe, as I do best with people of your transparent good-nature. I love puzzles, sure, but human puzzles are for another breed of personality. Your kind, anecdotally, is easier to read; not because you're less intelligent, but because you wear your heart on your sleeve. I hate reading sleeves for heart-stains, it's such tedious business. It's so refreshing to see palpating, beating hearts on your sleeves instead of extracellular outlines. \n\n\n
5	I love them, too. Its interesting to see how they think and live. My boyfriend is an INTP and sometimes I just sit there and watch him "being". We complete each other and every time I freak out for something, he is the one who calms me down. But I can't deny that it took time to realise how the other one works.
2	I married one. It's worked out for us! 
2	I was good friends with an INTP for several years, and we got along well. I really enjoyed that I could quit worrying about proprieties and jump right into interesting conversations with her. Same thing with my ISTP best friend.
1	What do you think of INFPs?	Well, it says it all.
5	So I was hopping over to this side of the MBTI to ask a similar question. I am with an ESFJ and we literally have been hitting things off great. Being an INFP, I don't ever truly feel satisfied, however, I really am falling for her more and more. I love the caring personality you all have. I really don't know what she see's in me, but I feel happier around her. We have been going on 3 months now and she is really supportive, kind, gentle, caring, and smart. I think it's a good match. We shall see I suppose.
3	Hey, ESFJ dating an INFP here. We've been dating for ~8 months now, and things are going great! He's a very intriguing person, and so different from my ex (who was an ESFJ too). Sometimes we get into arguments after some miscommunication, and about the way we process things, but I truly feel things are balancing out. He can talk on and on just about anything, but I love how he listens when I want to talk (which is always). My sister is also an INFP, and I definitely saw the similarities between them. INFPs seem to have a lot of depth to them that they keep locked up.\n\nAll in all, so far so good. He needs to chill on his idealism though, fr..... Tryna get the bills paid first... 
1	S's: Have you ever cheated? If so, why?	I'm [ENTP] part of the Intuitive Integration [INTJ, INFJ, ENTP, ENFP] page on Facebook. Recently, someone posted, asking if anyone has ever cheated. I was wondering whether the answers would changed, based on someone's N or S function. She here are the questions that were asked:\n\nDid you ever cheat on your partner?\nIf yes, how does it feel the moment you actually let someone start to undress you?\nUpdate: Guilt / no guilt? Can you actually really completely enjoy it?
1	Yes, when I was much younger and dating. Never while married or engaged (different relationship). Would never be OK with an open relationship.
1	never been in a relationship and i dont think i will ever cheat on somebody. i sometimes talk to several guys at a time (nothing serious though) but once i'm interested in a guy, eventhough we're not actually dating, i dont feel like talking to other guys. i'm weird i know
1	Is it too soon?	To those that are grieving a parent first I want to say I am truly sorry for your loss and wish I could take your pain away as I wish I could do for my husband that lost his mother (my mother in law) at the beginning of this year 😞 I have a question. My father in law (ESFP) married to mum for 35 years has moved on really quick. Saying this they were close and did everything together. They were never apart. We found out 3 weeks after mum had passed he was in a relationship. He chose 6 months after to tell his boys and said nothing serious was going to happen after he came back from a month long holiday but with in less of 24 hours of him telling them she (the new girl) plastered it all over facebook. We hadn't even meet her yet. Getting over the shock of that we have seen her twice but even then she is very reserved. Even the first meeting she disappeared for a nap. Now almost coming up a year of mum passing he has told my hubby that he wants to get engaged to her. When my hubby told me this I said is he was crazy. It's your mother's 1st Anniversary of passing and you don't want that surrounding that. He has even asked my hubby if he wants the family portraits that have mum in them from the family home. I don't know what to do or say to my father in law as you can imagine we are quite hurt and gutted by the lack of respect mostly for the boys to be able to grieve for their mother. Any thoughts of how I can approach this with my father in law? We do want dad to be able to move on but the lack of respect for the boys losing their mother is very hard. Also I'm confused with the lack of respect from the new girl too as we know she lost her father back in 2003. Thanks in advance
1	could be that this relationship started while mother was still around... Im not sure talking to father in law will resolve anything significant (or the new woman for that matter). it doesnt seem like theres much to do other than to gently/subtly remind them of how the boys are feeling...\n\nI think the best thing you can do is remain available for the boys when they need someone to talk to through their mourning. regardless of how their parent is behaving theyll almost surely get through this difficult time, and will be grateful to know theres other family who are there for them when they need emotional support\n\nthis whole situation seems like difficult terrain, but i hope this helps a little. 
1	Thanks for your advice wills keep it in mind.
1	Loss is hard and everyone experiences it in their own unique and individual ways.  Some people expect it, see it coming, prepare for it; others... loss comes as an earth shattering revelation.  While I'm slightly concerned that your father in law may jumping into a new relationship to distract from recent loss, I can not judge because I don't know if he accepted the loss or what feelings there may have been. If you are concerned... share your feelings ... word of caution: be prepared for what you are asking for...
1	What is the most important thing in your life?	Sorry for another survey-type post on your sub ;) Take it or leave it. \nThe most important thing in my life is my spirituality. 
3	Good friends.
3	My loved ones and their safety and happiness.
2	Happiness and spreading it. 
1	Love and family.
1	Question about personaltiy	So I took a test and said I am an esfj and reading up on it I am. But can someone personality change  up I wasn't always like this in high school I was social awkward not popular at all or are there exceptions some times like person to person
1	Honestly, I wasn't popular at all in high school either and can be extremely awkward. But I also think that many people in high school were turned off by me because my confidence and assertiveness came off as aggression, which wasn't my intention. I'm not a great listener and that could have been the reason too. \n\nAfter coming to college, I've become much more comfortable with who I am. I still wouldn't say I'm popular, but I would agree that I'm an approachable person and generally get along with most people.
1	yes it can change. not an ESFJ but my profile changed within a year. last year when i took the test i was an ENFJ but the result of my recent test was ENFP
1	I'm an ESFJ and I love it but sometimes I feel uncomfortable or awkward in social situations too and sometimes I enjoy my INTP-boyfriend caring for me like an ESFJ. So I would say it can change, sometimes over years, sometimes day per day.
1	It totally can change. The first time I took the test I think I was a pre-teen, wasn't what I am now. I've been an ESFJ for about 10 years now. So yeah, it's not unusual. 
0	What is for you the greatest invention of the 20th century?	"Various opinion polls have shown that the greatest invention of the twentieth century the invention of the pill, because people can love when they pleased, because women no longer fear that they will become pregnant. Wonder tablet have brought sexual and indirectly, economic independence, so they can compete for better jobs and no longer fainted when they saw a mouse - were no longer dependent on male stereotypes about women. Thanks to contraception have entered into a contractual relationship. The emancipation of women is actually a paradox of imparting a freedom because women requires more and more responsibilities and duties. What they once represented as a great social achievement and privilege today they are experiencing as a form of oppression." (Europeana: A Brief History of the Twentieth Century by Patrik Ouredník)\n\n\nA price of freedom? "Glorious" capitalism; crazy feminism! (What do you think?)
1	Poo-Pourri
3	ESFJ men, what are you like?	Heya, I'm an ISFJ and I suspect one of the guys in my class might be one of you people. I'm not really sure because I don't really know any male ESFJs (at least I don't think I do), and while it doesn't really matter anyway, I'd still like to know haha. So what are you like, or even better, what are/were you like in high school/college?
7	I read somewhere that ESFJ guys seem more guy-ish on the outside as they want to follow the typical society's ideal for men while on the inside they are emotional and try to hide it.
6	Realistic, social (to an extent), goal-oriented, preferring a structured schedule but loves an occasional random day.
1	So much of who I am internally is biased on who I was raised with. Family and friends really shape what we think is right and wrong, what is fun and boring, what works and doesn't work.(Si Ti) In high school and college I had a metric fuck-ton of people that I would call friends, but were really just friendly acquaintances. I was called a social butterfly more than once because of my strong desire to get to know as many people as possible "(Fe Ne). My family and my fiance have mentioned that over time they noticed that I had a different personality, attitude, mask, for every situation, but the core of me was always sweet, caring, and intensely fascinated with the souls of the people around me. If you want to know if your man is an ESFJ, go to a party where he is and at some point drop all small talk and ask him some deep personal questions, bring your own answers, if he goes frothing at the bit for more information (maybe even asks other people at the party to join in) he's probably an ESFJ. Or at the very least a lot like me .
2	ESFJ and friends in low mood	At first: English is not my mother tongue. :)\nSo, its no secret that we care about our loved ones very much. In fact, I hate it when my best friend or boyfriend are upset. I do my best to cheer them up but sometimes its not easy or even possible.\nLike yesterday, the computer from my boyfriend (INTP) got broken and he was inconsolable. I was positive and supporting because I know a bit about computers. He stayed inconsolable and I havent said something but it really fcked me up.\nFor me, it feels like a personal failure and I dont know how to deal with this.\nHe said, I gave him hope and a bit better mood, but for me it wasnt enough..\nIs there anyone out there with the same problem and, maybe, a proposal for solution?
3	Ahhh, that can be a tough one. We like to be able to "fix" things, including people's moods. However, we have to accept that we don't have control over other people's emotions ... even when it hurts us to see a loved one hurting or upset.
2	Amen. I know it's hard to accept that you can't make someone feel better. You want to make them as happy as they can be. But sometimes it's just not possible. You have to accept the fact that you did your best. They'll come around eventually.  
1	INTP here.  Making him feel better needs to be about making him feel better, not you.  He said you helped a bit, so that's good and you can feel good that you in fact succeeded at this.
2	INTP with ESFJ friend questions	INTP here with an ESFJ friend... We both stay home with little kids that need socializing and we both know it's good for us to see each other and visit, but she's mentioned before how hard it is for her to say no when she doesn't want to do something (which baffles me), and we've settled on me asking her when she wants to visit and her picking the day, so she isn't trying to do it at a bad time.  I realized I have a habit of drawing her into debates on religion and politics, which I of course love, but she recently told me she hates conflict (referring to something else I believe). To me, these discussions are academic and don't involve conflict.  But then I've been shocked lately when she tells me (wrongly) how I must really feel about something after processing something I've previously said through her own view of the world.  If I felt that way, I would have said it, and it really throws me off because I now have no idea what she really might be thinking about me when we talk.  But I realize that maybe I was making her uncomfortable in the first place with those types of conversations.  So, any insight on what is going on and how she probably feels would be really helpful.  But what I'm mostly wondering is, if she didn't particularly like me, would I even know? If Ivwas doing something that bothered her, would she tell me? What does an ESFJ like doing/talking about?  
11	I'm INTJ and my husband is ESFJ. \n\nESFJs are like golden retrievers, for lack of a better word. They tend to be very social, extremely loyal, and feel good to be around. They also care deeply even when they seem bubbly on the outside. They live an emotional existence, which makes them great at empathy, sensitivity, and even having a good time. \n\nIt's true that ESFJ people hate "conflict" aka talking about religion and politics. Disagreeing on something so personal definitely feels like conflict to them, not debate, and ESFJs hate to disagree with someone they care about. Debate implies (and feels) like there is a winner and a loser, and ESFJs hate to lose. \n\n> how I must really feel about something after processing something I've previously said \n\nThis seems to be an ESFJ trait, too. They process what they hear to its maximum emotional conclusion and then it sounds totally different to INTx ears. They don't seem to understand that other types don't have all-encompassing emotions. \n\nIn short, stop talking religion and politics with your ESFJ friend. You're stressing them out. 
1	That you are friends with an ESFJ is a testament to how committed you both are to your friendship. In my experience, NTPs and SFJs don't get along very well. The frictions you've described above are one of my observations why this relationship isn't - on paper - a perfect fit. But I've also noticed that SFJs tend to value approval and recognition over everything else. This is particularly difficult for an NTP to stomach because it just seems so inconsequential to a type with Fe in the tertiary/inferior position. To put it bluntly I can't help but pity this seemingly uncontrollable desire for others' recognition. I have so many cringe moments with my ESFJ coworker where I'm just flatly embarrassed on their behalf. And ESFJs are especially notorious for this because a dominant Fe can be so rampant. For example, my above-mentioned coworker will go out of their way to craft a superb, albeit extremely wordy, question in a training/meeting only to immediately be on their phone when their question is being answered. They seem to have no interest in the actual answer to their question, rather, their goal and desire are simply to be thought of as being knowledgeable in the process of asking the question in the first place. That goal being accomplished, the ESFJ will disengage and begin checking the twitter feed. I can't quantify just how crazy this drives me both from the perspective of the person answering the question and the fact that the ESFJ does not understand how disrespectful this is! This same coworker also has a very difficult relationship with our manager (an INTP). This is partly because the INTP manager is extremely defensive - something that will deter the ESFJ to ever broach a conflict and in any case ensure that the ESFJ will never bring it up again should they ever muster the wherewithal in the first place. It is true that they complain a lot about the manager but they never let them know how they truly feel. This could very well be the manager/subordinate factor at work but, if I were to imagine a similar friction with a coworker, I can't imagine them coming out to directly address the issue in that scenario either. I imagine that you will have to be the one that addresses any conflicts you have or foresee. You'll have to do it tactfully, even playfully, in order to ensure you'll get the ESFJ's true views on it. Anyway, I'm rambling here but the gist is - bravo for having an ESFJ friend.\n\nThat said, if you're able to have a friendship and not be driven crazy by their mere existence (and them yours), you can overcome whatever content-related frictions you're having. 
9	ESFJ Relationships	Prizing social validation and a sense of belonging so highly, romantic relationships hold a special level of importance for ESFJs. No other kind of relationship provides people with the ESFJ personality type with the same level of support and devotion, and the feelings of security and stability that come with strong romantic relationships are extremely warming.\n\nESFJs don't do casual flings – they need to know that their partners will always be by their sides offering unwavering support, and marriage and family are the ultimate goal.\n\nWith such a goal in mind, ESFJ personalities take each stage, from dating to everything thereafter, very seriously. Everything about ESFJs' relationships is based on satisfying mutual needs, from creating understanding early on to building mutual respect and support for each other's opinions and goals. Knowing that they are loved and appreciated has a huge effect on ESFJs' mood and self-esteem.\n\nIf they feel like this support isn't there, such as when their partners deliver criticism, ESFJs can feel extremely hurt. People with the ESFJ personality type dislike conflict and criticism, which can make it challenging to address any problems that come up. Nothing is more hurtful or depressing to ESFJs than to realize that their partners don't respect their dreams or opinions. ESFJs can be surprisingly tough and tireless in the face of hardship, but they need to know without a doubt that their partners are behind them 100%.\n\nUnfortunately, less mature ESFJs may lack the inner strength and wisdom to attract this in healthy ways. They can be very needy, compromising their own principles and values in exchange for their partners' approval. This is a terrible trap – not only is it unattractive, it can too easily lead to emotionally abusive relationships, which reduce ESFJs' self-esteem further. Another snare is their fixation on social status and approval – it's not uncommon for ESFJs' social circles and relatives to play a bigger part in their choice of dating partners than even their own values.\n\nESFJs are warm, loyal people who want to feel trusted and valued. They are great with practical matters like money management and administrative tasks, and are happy to take on such responsibilities in the name of taking care of the people they care about, a wonderful quality. ESFJs just need to make sure they take the time to ensure that they build relationships that allow them to satisfy their own needs and dreams, with partners who appreciate their care and generosity fully, and who reciprocate as well.\n\nESFJs are often very organized in how their relationships develop, following established dating rules and traditions (don't call first, third date, etc.). As their relationships enter more sexual stages, ESFJs' emphasis on process and tradition continue with established gender roles and socially acceptable activities.\n\nHowever, since ESFJs are so centered on the physical world and are quite emotional, they tend to be very affectionate and sensual, and overall great sexual partners. People with this personality type love to find ways to make their partners happy, and this sort of intimacy is a great way to do so. As the two partners become more comfortable with each other, ESFJs are often open to experimenting and trying new things, so long as their partners are willing to reciprocate.\n\nESFJs have specific needs for their relationships, and certain personality types are best able to meet those needs. In general, partners should share ESFJs' Observant (S) trait, but it can also be useful to develop a sense of introspection that Introverted (I) partners can provide, with maybe one more opposing trait to help ESFJs focus on logical decisions when appropriate, or to be more open-minded in new situations.

0	ESFJs: Whaddya think about Trump?	
3	i'm just hoping he loses and fades into obscurity
2	MAGA
2	He's a jerk. I don't like him.
4	What's the difference between an ENFJ person and ESFJ person?	I've never really been able to grasp the difference between Sensing and Intuitive. I know what they are on their own, but how would those look different when fitted into an EFJ personality? Just trying to figure out which I am and curious for y'all's thoughts :)
3	Not an expert, but in general, I believe ENFJs are more creative and big-picture oriented, whereas ESFJs are more practical and detail-oriented. I've also read that ENFJs can keep things more "close to the vest," whereas ESFJs show everything they think and feel on their face (definitely true in my case!)
2	What a great question! I have taken the Myers Briggs twice with a couple years apart and gotten both ESFJ and ENFJ. I know that it can change for various reasons over time, but I feel the same confusion about the two because I can identify with so many criteria for each. Most recently I've gotten ESFJ.. so that's what I'm goin with for now. Haha 
2	Just found out one of my dearest friends is an ENFJ, so I have a little additional insight. I would say that the biggest difference between us is that she is definitely more of a planner and takes more of a long-term approach to things. I tend to be more worried about the here and now. She also is definitely a person who can step back and look at a situation in its entirety, whereas I tend to dwell on details. In addition, she is definitely more circumspect, and I'm an open book.
1	INTP here, How do I make myself attractive to an ESFJ?	I really like her and I am afraid to make any move. I feel anxious about what it may turn into.\nPlease tell me about what qualities in an INTP do ESFJs like and how I can grow it?\n\nHello from the other side. 😉
4	Hey there,\n\nI love INTPs! My little sister is one and we are exact opposites (as you mentioned), but we somehow make it work. She appreciates my unreserved love of people and how relaxed my joy is.\n\nThings I like:\n\nI enjoy her quirky humor (although puns don't really do for me what they do for her), as well as her sharp mind for processes and problem solving. She also tends to be quite calm, and will listen to anything I say and then offer cold, unbiased advise. Not always  fun, but if you're honest with yourself then you do appreciate the advise.\n\nThings I don't like about her:\n- Sometimes she's a little too cold/withdrawn\n- She can be a bit too dismissive of a fun time\n- She can be a bit quiet for me\n\nHope this helps!
1	Data, analysis, fun facts & 'did you knows' and all things that would make your Ti have a happy dance. Counterintuitive, but this is probably your best bet in wooing an ESFJ. It's all in pleasing that inferior cognitive function. It's a blind spot for us all but its where we go when we feel vulnerable and just want to feel comfortable. And what better way to woo someone than to make them feel comfortable? \n\nFor example, as an ENTP, my inferior cognitive function is Si. I believe that if anyone found out the songs and movies that are soundtrack to my childhood through college years, that's likely the easiest way into my heart. Si and Ti are the easiest functions to exploit in this fashion. Fe and Te might be the most difficult. Good thing she's not trying to woo you in this case then init ;)
0	MBTI and video game preferences	I was playing around with the video of affiliating different MBTI types to different video game preferences specifically with the eight Jungian cognitive functions. Any Thoughts? 
1	Word vomit around your crush?!?	Hey fellow Esfj's how do you guys act around people you like?(crush)\n\nWhen I like someone I tend to get either quiet around that person or a little to excited when around them. When I'm with my friends I get open more and start to say stupid stuff but it's only because the person I like is there so I tend to get to anxious. But when we're one on one I talk better with him. And when I know there in the same room I tend to look for them just to know we're there at and who there talking to(discreetly). What wrong with me!? Why am I saying stupid stuff I would usually never say!?!(I'm so confused)😵 🔫
1	Oh my god, I used to do that HORRIBLY when I was younger. It was spectacularly awful. I eventually outgrew it.
1	" No other kind of relationship provides people with the ESFJ personality type with the same level of support and devotion, and the feelings of security and stability that come with strong romantic relationships are extremely warming."\n- https://www.16personalities.com/esfj-relationships-dating\n\nESFJ's tend to require devotion and support in relationships. Due to this, most relationships with ESFJ's are formed after an initial close friendship. Therefore my advice to you is to get to know him better, treat him like a friend and see if you think it will work from there.
3	I finally have a male ESFJ on my channel!	
1	-*cricket sounds*-
2	Small talk	What do you guys think of it? Do you think it's a nice way to get to know people? Or is it as useless as the commercials before YouTube videos, and you wish we could just skip to deeper conversations?\n\nI've asked this in all the mbti sub-reddits (is that what it's called?) Someone posted an article about it in the INTP group, if you want to read it, but you don't have to, just want to know what you think. -curious intp\n\nAlso I don't know how to define small talk, but I think it's safe to include social graces, work/school, and weather (I apologize if you are a weather nerd or something and actually find it very intriguing to talk about)
3	I like limited small talk. I definitely enjoy deeper conversations, but if the small talk stays upbeat and interesting I can definitely hang with it for a while. 
2	I love small talk because it helps me understand people better and it also helps me see potential doorways I can use to move the conversation into more meaningful topics.
1	I really hate it.  I do it because I have to, and I'm patient getting to the deep stuff.  But I want to know someone's *soul*.
1	ESFJ's usually have no problem with small talk or following social cues in order to help them take an active role in their communities which is due to there need to fit into groups and social circles. However, ESFJ's tend to deeply care about others and are consistently emotionally supportive. In conclusion, small talk is used by ESFJ's to conform socially but when conversing with one person (Texts are a great example) they tend to stray into deeper conversations which is excellently shown by user BlondeRJ in his comment below.
1	Amen to that. Small talk is fine. But if I had to choose, I'd always choose to delve deep into someone.
2	I'm making a MBTI statistics and I would appreciate your input.	I need more ESFJs to participate in MBTI relationship statistics, because as of now, there are no ESFJs, whereas other types are crossing 100 limit right now. \n\n[Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19k9UrDFdQtci5-kRNeykkR3J4iw7c1A2y0zqirHQtoI) is the form.\n\nI really appreciate your help. And if you are really interested in statistics, [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yFpUbw92VH_BGrVf-FMngyCdtERYVvvGOEL_T58kw9Q/edit#gid=641219863) is the sheet, (Check out other Tabs. It's also always updated.) It's currently unfinished, so pardon any bugs. And it's better to copy it to your google drive and edit INFP Tab from "INFP" in cell A3, to "ESFJ" if you want to see your statistics. ESFJ Tab is somewhat less finished due to Google Sheets bugs.
3	Enegram & Big 5 Are Not Popular Because There's Nothing Much To Read About Them In Comparison To MBTI?	Why are "Enegram" & "Big 5" test not as popular as MBTI?\n\nI think it may be because there is a lot to read about your personality type online after taking a MBTI test but nothing much after taking the "Enegram" or "Big 5" test.\n\nWhat do you think?
2	13 Questions! MBTI & Music	Hi!

3	What do you think of INTPs?	
3	Generally, I like them! I have a little sister who is an INTP. She is pretty chill, no nonsense, and a hard worker. We are exact opposites, and sometimes that means having to explain things to each other several times before we even understand what the other is trying to say, but this usually results in laughs before tears.\n\nShe can be a stupid witch sometimes, but then again, so can I ;)\n\nWe are able to help each other out with things when it comes to perspective (she helps me lay things out more analytically and I help her not be embarrassed by her emotions).\n\nI'm not sure if I could be romantically involved with an INTP, but it really depends on the person. Even people within a type grouping are unique :)\n\nHope this helps! \n\n-ESFJ
3	I'm an INTP AMA. *warning* It might take me a bit to answer. *warning* I might be condescending.\nBut I will answer your questions honestly and to the best of my ability. 
3	Married to one.  I love him dearly.  We've had our share of fights and misunderstandings, but he is the #1 human being who is best for me and balances me out, and I am attached to him in a borderline yandere way.  :-D
2	I am married to an INTP. AMA. \n\nWe both took the personality test before we got married, our counselor pretty much told us that we would definitely bump heads on who was right. \n\nWe have been going strong for 7 years and we are still (if not more) madly in love with each other! Like the kissy smoochie love!! I think because we knew we were complete opposites, we had an easier time dealing with our stronger traits. We complement each other fully, and we work well together. We currently work together as car haulers living on the road, so we are together 24/7. We haven't done this in 5 years, and the first round was only 7 months long, so here goes nothing!
1	I find INTPs very interesting. It's hard sometimes because as an ENTP I'm very curious and i like to break through people's barriers. So interacting with INTP can be a little bit frustrating at times. In saying that I'm learning to appreciate boundaries, sometimes. Have not had a major clash or breakdown of communication as yet! 
2	Did you feel like an outsider growing up?	
3	Intp lost in esfj subreddit. Yes I did. I felt like I was adopted. My family doesn't understand me. I kept doing things wrong socially. I was just an awkward duck.

3	Is this healthy ESFJ behaviour?	My mom is an ESFJ. She is very clingy and a massive nitpicker. She likes to put her arms around me/my brother for no reason and without our consent. If my hair is off in the slightest way, she will hold me in place and fix it, no matter how long it takes. She also refers to introverts as "weird" or "just shy" and rejects any counter-arguments I have. The most annoying thing she does by far is act like an airhead. 
1	ESFJ here.  That just sounds like overbearing mom behavior. How old are you?  I'd just sit down with her and calmly explain that you feel uncomfortable when she acts that way, and that you'd like to be treated as the [age appropriate] person you are.  \n\nEdit to add:  You want your mom to respect you as your own person.  That's important and I agree 100%.  However, you should also work on accepting and respecting your mom as a person.  Some of these things sound like they are just her personality traits.  They might annoy you, but they are not uncommon nor unhealthy.  For example, my mother in law (who is NOT an ESFJ) is the biggest airhead I know.  It drives me crazy but it's just who she is.  I know there are things about me that drive her crazy.  We are different, and I have to accept that and move on.
1	Thankfully, my ESFJ mom is not that bold about anything and she seems to accept that I'm not ever going to be as affectionate as my sister (ENFJ). I can relate to the whole "oh, you're just shy" thing. She doesn't seem to understand that it's not mental shyness, I physically don't like the noise and stimulation of going out all the time. For a while she didn't get that I didn't ever have to be fixed.
7	Are ESFJ women more privileged?	there was a question in the intp sub asking\n\n> Does US culture have a preference for ESFJ women ? Are INTP women depicted more negatively than women of any other type ?\n\nso, what do you think? \n\nDo you feel you benefit from this supposed preference?\n\nAnd do you feel such a preference negatively impact women of other types? \n\nOr is it just insulting and divisive passively aggressively attacking ESFJ women for inborn traits and simply being a larger majority than say intp women?
4	I recently had a coworker take the test who is an INTP. We get along great but we are polar opposites, and sometimes it leads to mild clashes.\n\nWe work in finance so she's very direct and a leader, whereas I'm the bubbly friendly one. I think it bothers her that I'm buddy buddy with everyone, but I also notice that I have to work harder to prove myself because I have the typical "airhead" qualities. \n\nWhile she was taking her personality test there was a question that made her pause. "Would you rather your child grow up to be kind or smart?" When I answered I picked kind because I value that. Hers was smart. We discussed the pros and cons of both. \n\nIf you're kind, people are more patient and understanding and willing to teach you. If you're smart but an asshole, people are more likely to get their back up when you present a thought or idea, because it comes off aggressively. That being said, an INTPs suggestion seems to hold more weight because they typically are really confident in their skills whereas an ESFJ is more laid back and accommodating with their ideas.\n\nI definitely think the context of the personalities is key - work or socially. INTP would be more of a boss figure and a go-to leader for knowledge, but an ESFJ would have the social upper hand and be more approachable in most areas.\n\nAnd as the saying goes, it's not what you know but who you know. 
3	Well they might be priviliged but they are basically enslaved to making other people feel good so it's a double-edged sword.
2	 I'm sure that ESFJ women are well aware that they are a popular and a preferred type and are viewed positively by society at large. 
1	I think preference would be the wrong term. People prefer people who make them feel good about themselves. ESFJ's make people feel important, valued, listened to. They don't do it consciously, it just comes from within. So, if we are preferred, it's people's innate need to be accepted and validated that gives us this perceived preference.

11	18 years old INTP here, you ESFJs are amazing	Just wanted to tell you ESFJs that I really like to be around you because you make me see things from a completely different perspective that I've wouldn't ever have thought of. Plus, I love the fact that we have the same function, but in reverse order and that you can help me develop my weak functions and vice-versa. At the beginning of high school, I was being bullied a lot because I was very nerdy, weird and "awkward as fuck" (typical INTP xD). It was very difficult, but I had **this** ESFJ friend. She was incredible and always there for me, her genuine kindness gave me a huge amount of motivation, and it was all I needed to believe in myself and begin having ambition in life (at that time, I hated school because I was bullied; now I want to obtain a PHD in theoretical physics). The fact that people like you ESFJs exist is amazing. Have a nice day :)
6	As a 27 male INTP who is about to marry an amazing ESFJ woman, I can't agree more. You ESFJ's are so kind. And even though we may seem super critical and negative about everything, we want you to know that you fill a part of our lives that no other personality can. Though our critical attitude makes us sound unhappy, we really do love you guys!
3	If there's something that we ESFJ's adore, it's when people make it known that our enduring kindness can have such a profound positive effect. I'm so glad that your friend was able to do so for you! 😊\nAll the best in your studies!
2	Maybe, but having an ESFJ parent or an ESFJ boss is fucking annoying. As friends though they are great. 
2	We love you too, INTP!  <3  <3\n\n(Married an INTP.  You guys are thrilling to me.  :-) )
1	I can truely relate to what u said. \nEven the school thing. And getting such a emotional support from this ESFJ girl.\nI wana ask u a different thing though as I find u too relatable.\n\nI am kinda in a dilemma. And it's about choosing a major. The 2 majors that are fighting in my mind are Theoretical physics and Computer Science. And in terms of what I am good at, I am good at both.\n\nConputer Science will provide me more money(according to the trend right now). And allow me to work from home. Also try new things.\n\nTheoretical physics is what I am very interested at. This path will provide me with things to think. According to what I think now, it will allow me to be stimulated.\n\nI think u were also in a dilemma, maybe similar, what are the reasons and how did u decide?. \nHope u ans it.
2	What were you guys like as children?	Best and worst moments of growing up?\nWhat do you think about members of your family?\nWhat were academics like?\nWhat motivated you?\n
3	I liked being at home with my family the most. It was hard for me to keep long lasting friends because I was kind of bossy. The best moments I have are being around my family laughing and eating and just being myself with them
1	For me I was shy. Never been on great terms with my family, especially in recent years. Always relied on friends more. Always an average/ slightly above average student. Always tried to seem/act smart which got me in trouble a few times 
1	Like Hermione Granger, to be completely honest. Always called bossy and a know-it-all.\n\nEDIT: I'm an ESTJ, sorry, I saw this on the SJ forum.
1	Worst moments were my ENTJ father losing his temper.  Otherwise, I had a seriously ideal childhood.\n\nI am close with all of my family members, although, at times, my three younger siblings have all been distant, combative, or outright uncommunicative.  So that hurts.  But we get through those things.\nI am super super super close with both of my parents now though.  They are my best friends, and they spend a lot of time with me.\n\nI was a straight A student with a high IQ.  Married my INTP husband.\nI am highly motivated by psychology and helping people, as well as my Christian faith.  I write books and homeschool our kids.  I love to theorize - even more than the INTP.  (Yes, we have our types right.  Not all stereotypes are true.  ;-))
1	Best moments was doing well in school. Always a straight-A-teacher's-pet type. Had a solid group of friends, but fit in with all the groups (i.e. populars, goths, thugs, preppy, athletes - typical ESFJ social butterfly). Worst moments was just family drama, nothing personality related. My mom is/was crazy. Attempted suicide when I was 8 or 9. Lived with my grandma for many years. So that put a strain on everyone and every relationship in the family. Two older brothers. It always seemed like only two of us could get along at a time. I was motivated for a long time (still fight it now) by my need for my mother's approval. Overall, I was a VERY good, obedient, studious child. Rarely acted out. Never got in trouble at school. The only time I got detention in my entire life was for chewing gum.
2	Big fun Reddit MBTI survey	**Edit: I have closed the survey.** Basic preliminary data is available here: [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWpyBCtgq81S03KJZYVzn5tVVhUgbTcJ6lqUhDFb78EQQEtA/viewanalytics?usp=form_confirm)\n\nHi all. I'm interested in seeing what correlations exist between certain types and various random things, so I've created a big survey. Its a little bit long, it will probably take 10-30 min depending how fast you are at filling out surveys. I tried to mix fun questions with serious questions and so topics include pop culture, politics, art, lifestyle, etc.\n\nI also posted this in /r/mbti, but I'd like some more varied responses (INxx types really like filling out surveys) The survey is at [this link to google forms](https://goo.gl/forms/fHSemrg0ey1EYfK63)\n\nIt is completely anonymous, handled my google forms. After you take it it will let you see the raw results, please don't spoil these results for others. Once I have enough responses, I will perform a statistical analysis on the results and share them on /r/mbti.\n\nIf you know anyone else interested in MBTI, feel free to share the survey, but please only fill it out once yourself.\n\n**Please don't spoil** the survey questions for others, particularly the trivia questions, I want to see what types have knowledge/interest of certain things.\n\n*I'd like to know (without spoilers), what you thought of the survey and what additional questions you would have included. So please let me know.*
6	INTP with a crush on ESFJ	Known each other our entire lives, recently started hanging out more, I started to develop feelings and suppressed them because I didn't want to wreck the friendship as I really value it.\n\nLast week I told her how I felt, and she said she didn't see me in that way at this point. I still want to be friends and she seems fine with that but at the same time I still find myself hoping that maybe someday she will see my that way (stupid wishful thinking I'm sure). That being said, maybe someone here could talk me through why this could or could not be a terrible idea?\n\nI guess I should also mention the ages are me being 21M and her being 22F
6	This subreddit is a desert. So I will pretend to be an esfj for now. Why do you like her? \n\n-An ENTP in the wrong subreddit 
3	The question becomes, if in the future she does NOT change her mind, is this going to piss you off/upset you/make you resent the time you spent with her.  If you can't just be OK with her as a friend forever, then I think it would be best if you distanced yourself and turned your search elsewhere.  The "at this point" she gave you might have been her trying not to hurt your feelings, it might actually have been "ever".  As an ESJF I often try to spare someone's feelings by not putting my foot down as much as I should, she may be the same.  
2	This isn't going to answer your question, but... I'm an ESFJ, and my husband is an INTP. It works really well for us. :) 
1	I did this.  Thought my INTP and I had too little in common.  But his sheer perseverance won me over in no time.  Best relationship ever.
3	ESFJs, please, help me.	I have problem with my best friend. She is ESFJ, that's why I'm asking you for help.\nWe're friends for 3,5 year. From the beggining BFFs. We were spending every hour with each other, messaging or talking.\nAt the end of last year I moved to another country. We haven't meet since that. We're still messaging all days.\nBut about a week ago something changed.\nWe spend less and less time together. She gives all her energy, heart and soul to fanpage of one youtuber. \nShe's my only friend. I'm afraid that our frendship can die in few months.\nI'm maybe addicted to her. I don't really know. \nBut I'm sure I can't tell her how I feel. It would hurt her and she would blame herself.\n\nMaybe almost everyone would make new friends and let her go, but I'm too shy. If I lose her, I will be alone.\nWhat should I do to save our friendship?
1	Hey, it's okay. You don't have to be with each other talking to each other every single day. Imagine doing that when you are adults, married.You can still maintain your friendship by communicating less frequently.This change..try and see it.. maybe it is a blessing in disguise? Now you have more time for others. Your family members, a friend or two maybe? Now I know you said that you are shy but let me tell you this. Everyone is strong enough naturally and I want you to know that eventually you are gonna have to put yourself out there with other people to make friends. These does seem scary but it is fun and worth it. You can still be friends with her but now you can accommodate other people in your life too. Being addicted to her seems a little unhealthy, no? Like being addicted to drugs, to games, to smoking. Relax, the circumstances have changed now but it's probably for the better. Be strong! 
1	You know it's funny because I've been in a similar situation and I'm the ESFJ. There was this one girl I knew and we were friends for probably close to 3 to 4 years. She lived a couple of states away so I never really saw her that much. I had a really big crush on her, but it was evident she didn't feel the same way towards me. At times I even questioned whether I was much of a friend to her since when she would get a bf she would stop talking with me. I would fret about when it took her more than a day to get back to me because I took it as a sign that I had screwed up somehow. I actually told her I didn't want to be friends anymore and tried to forget about her, only to try and reconnect about a year later. I too was lonely. I missed having someone who I was as close to as her. The friendship this time around didn't last more than a year. This time though, we kind of both just stopped talking to each other. She was pretty mad towards me about something last we spoke but since then neither of us have really talked to each other. \n\nNow though, I've met  someone who also lives a couple of states away and is a lot worse at texting actually (it sometimes takes her 3-4 days to get back to me). And even though I fret that she is losing interest, I have to keep in mind she's just busy. But I really enjoy talking with her more than I had the other friend within the past couple of months of our friendship, even though we talk less frequently.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say I don't know if there is anything you can really do based on personality types. Friendship is a two way street and if someone doesn't want to be friends then there's not much you can do. You could always talk to your friend and see what they think? I know I always appreciate it when someone is straight forward with me (but again, idk if that has to do with personality types)\n\nTLDR: Knew a girl who lived far away. Talked everyday, friendship fell apart. Now talk to a girl who I talk to less frequently, friendship in a better place. Try talking with your friend directly maybe, or try and move on. It's not worth the effort trying to make something work where the other part isn't interested.\n\nPS: Another option is you don't even have to go as extreme as I did and call the friendship off. You could just only respond when they respond to you while looking for other friends. That way you're still friends and if they ever realized they miss talking with you they could always start talking with you more\n\nEdit: And I know it's easier said than done with just ending a friendship, and trust me it hurt like hell when I called it off with the first person, which is why the second time around I just let things die out. I hate it when I'm on bad terms with anyone. A way maybe to make more friends would be join a sports club in your town? Or another club that has a hobby you're interested in. The less dependent you are on one person the easier it is to move on. If you decide to move on, I know something that helped me was I stopped following her on Instagram, Snapchat, etc. Out of sight out of mind mentality. You could also check out subreddits like /r/r4r if you want to find someone to talk with.
1	Infp?
1	Are you INFJ?\n\nIt sounds like you are far too attached to this ESFJ.  I had an INFJ friend like that, and it was bad news.  As much as it hurt, I finally had to just get some space.\n\nIt could be she feels like you two are bad for each other and is trying to create healthy boundaries.  I'd be very real and open and just talk to her about it.  Try to create a happy middle ground.
1	Tell her how you feel about the situation. She probably is backing away to see were she stands with you. Thats what I do. We are people of closure. We tend to see if that person we're backing away from will make a effort for us. To see if we are wanted still or Worth it.
3	How would you describe yourself?	Personality wise, character wise, beliefs, dreams etc.
5	My husband is ESFJ. \n\nHe is the life of the party. He's like a golden retriever -- loyal to a fault, happy and bubbly around friends, always excited for a chance to go outside and see more people. When we go places together, people greet him warmly and loudly. It seems like he knows everyone. He's so charismatic. \n\nHe doesn't consider himself to be smart. (I think he's smart.) But he is so driven and people are so drawn to him that he finds success in everything he tries. He is in a very difficult profession and excels in it, but still feels it's his people skills that got him there. \n\nMy ESFJ has soooo manyyyy feeelingggssss. Feelings are supreme for him, he cannot rationalize his way out of emotion. He loves poetry and cinema and art for its emotional resonance. He feels empathy so deeply it can be painful to him. He is not ashamed of being a sensitive man. \n\nHe cares too much about people who don't care back. He's loyal instantly and forever, no matter what. He fears abandonment so he gives endless second chances. He's stubborn and easily frustrated. He struggles with anxiety. 
4	I'm bubbly, talkative, an insatiable romantic...love to laugh and smile, going out to movies is my absolute favorite thing to do besides being a part of making them. I am always there for people, even when they're not there for me. \n\nNegatives include talking too much, caring too much, being awful with money and always wanting things my way ;) Sometimes I feel like people don't care enough for/ about me. I have struggled with anxiety and depression most of my life.\n\nIn regards to goals and such, I am pretty good at reaching goals. Once I set my mind to doing something, I get 'er done...good luck stopping me.\n\nOccupation: Writer.\n\n
2	Far different and deeper than anyone guesses. Weird and odd and extreme and utterly confident.  Eager to change. Filled to the brim with love, yet scared out of my mind.  Kind of a dichotomy. 
2	I'm a Esfj I like for everyone to be happy. always up to having fun. I always like to be around people to have a good time. I usually love conversation. When excited with friends I get really hyper and jumpy .\nEven though I don't express my dreams in life i to have dreams but I don't share unless you ask if you ask then I'll have a deep conversation with you but I usually start with small talk to get to know someone.if you take time to get to know me,initiating conversation I really like that. At least that's me.
1	Weeee! Yes, "Out of the Eater" by Lillian Barker (my nom de plume!).\n\nWhat about yourself?
8	Hey ESFJs! I have a questionnaire about personality type and music preference and I'm lacking in some ESFJ responses, I would really appreciate the help! Thanks!	
10	Yeh we are ^_^	
2	deep.
4	Any ESFJs married to/dating INTJs or vice versa?	I am hardcore crushing on an INTJ and we are SLOWLY getting to know each other. I'm letting him move at his own pace because if it were me we'd have started dating a while back. ANYWAYS.\n\nAny experiences (positive or negative) that you'd be willing to share? Words of wisdom? From what I hear it's either a great experience or an awful one :/
2	[deleted]
2	I'm an INTJ and seriously dating an ESFJ.  We've been dating close to a year and here are some insights.  \n\n--Communication is vital.\n\n--Our emotional side is our weakest trait.  Be patient and open-minded. We open up eventually.\n  \n--We can be blunt and not be sensitive to your feelings.  It comes from a rational solution of how we think.  INTJs are always learning to be more sensitive. \n\n--We tend to analyse everything in terms of if the relationship fits our ecosystem. If it meets the criteria, then we are in it for the long run.  \n\n--We don't like colors that stick out, lol.  Don't try to dress us up! We can meet in the middle. I think ESFJs like to stick out and be recognized.  INTJs like to blend in and be unnoticed. \n\n--Do something out of the blue like bake him something.  My gf did this for me and I appreciate the thought and time she put into it.  A rare surprise that made me smile. \n\n--INTJs don't like competition on insignificant things. \n\n--We like to talk about ideas, big goals and how to get there.  That's a big one.  If both of you are on the same page, it's a go.\n\nI think if INTJ and ESFJ are willing to meet in the middle, then both can teach the other valuable skills to be a super couple. I'm more social b/c of her and she is more aware of herself b/c I taught her to be more reflective, be more practical with her habits and ask more questions of 'why'.  My gf has gotten me out of my shell, to be more open towards doing things that are not on the big picture to-do list or things I really suck at.  We recently went to those wine/paint classes.  I suck at art and she told me to relax and enjoy myself of being a rookie. To my surprise, I really enjoyed it! \n\nAnyhow, I hope things work out.  We are having a blast being together. Opposite attract!\n\nedit -word
1	I have friends who are married, she is an ESFJ, he is an INTJ. They've been very happily married for probably 18 years now. She's helped him soften up his "mean" side (he tells it like it is). He has taught her to be honest and communicate effectively. Their dynamic works really well, especially since they understand their differences.\n\nHope this helps!
1	According to socionics this is an ideal pair. According to MBTI not so much. It would be great if you guys could make it work cause you guys can learn so much from eachother. #infj
1	I am an INTJ and my wife is an ESFJ. We've been married for 8 years and so far it's going great. \n\nCheck out [Personality Hacker's podcast] (http://pca.st/JLNI) for a great one minute post on how INTJ's get and give love. Helps see things from you SO's side. 
1	Thanks!!
1	I would never cross any human being off my list, and have been pleasantly surprised getting to know everyone.\n\nThat being said, I have never, ever, ever been attracted to an INTJ, and I cannot fathom how it would work, personally, for me.\n\nBut I am not attracted to TJs period.  The harshness is something I can't tolerate.
1	I don't either...that's why it's weird :p
3	MBTI podcast: Interview with an ESFJ woman	Hello! My BFF and I cohost a podcast about Myers Briggs that we produce on our own in our house. I’m ENTP and she’s ESFP. Lately we’ve been interviewing people as a way to catalog types so others can get to know and identify that type.\n\nFor a year we thought Brittany was an ESTJ, but through this episode we figure out she's actually an ESFJ! She talks with ESFP Meredith and ENTP Kaila about how she loves hosting parties, spends time and money renovating her home in Washington, teaches 4th grade and LOVES her pets.\n\nThis specific episode: https://soundcloud.com/when-myers-met-briggs/esfj-brittany\n\n* [In general: Soundcloud.com/when-myers-met-briggs](https://soundcloud.com/when-myers-met-briggs)\n\n* [Facebook.com/WhenMyersMetBriggs](https://www.facebook.com/WhenMyersMetBriggs)\n\n* [Subscribe on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/when-myers-met-briggs/id1060274982)\n\n* [Twitter.com/WMMBpodcast](https://twitter.com/wmmbpodcast)\n\n* [Instagram.com/WMMBpodcast](https://www.instagram.com/wmmbpodcast/)\n\n(X-post https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4pc0dh/mbti_podcast_interview_with_an_esfj_teacher_and/)
7	random survey! all types needed especially E and J	
3	Highly amusing.  Any chance of seeing the results/report?
2	Unconventional Wisdom	My fellow ~NT~ friend and I are throwing around an idea for a podcast. People write in and we dispense rational, scientific based advice, divorced of feeling or sympathy, a la Data / Spock from Star Trek.\n\nIt would require research on our part for some questions. For example, if someone writes in about a contentious relationship, we'd have to look up the different styles of amygdala  hijack (fight or flight response to stress) and how to deescalate the situation. \n\nThere would be NO "tell the person how you feel" or "just be yourself" or "love yourself at your size", feeler advice. \n\nJust cold hard, science based, advice and an action plan attached to it. And of course some ~NT~ snark. \n\nSo I'm taking a survey. \n\nHow many of you think this could make an entertaining podcast? \n\nAdditionally....\n\nWe are currently taking advice requests from people 18+ to make a dummy run of the podcast (to gauge how long it should be, editing, style etc)\n\nOur test run will not be put out to the general public, but if your letter is selected we will send you the audio file of our test run. \n\nOf course, your identity would remain anonymous. \n\nYou can send a letter here.\n\nunconventionalwisdompodcast@gmail.com\n\nIf you have any suggestions or comments, I would love to hear them. We are in the planning stages now, and any ideas are appreciated. 
3	INFP chasing ESFJ	I'm an INFP, and as it is with this type, I have a tendency to become overbearing in relationships. I'm talking with an ESFJ girl who's been my friend for a couple years now, and we both know that we have feelings for each other. We'll finally start hanging out gain once I transfer back to my old college (where she stayed), and I'm worried that I'll put too much pressure on her to start an actual relationship too soon. I'm crazy about her, but I don't want that to come out in the wrong way. So ESFJs (particularly ladies), do you have any specific do's or don't's for me? And INFPs, any tips on how you kept your cool to start a long relationship? 
1	I was in a relationship with an ENFJ. I think it's roughly the same as it's probably their Fe they see you through. As INFPs we worry too much about crossing anyones line and become invasive, but we hardly are (generally speaking from my experience.). The way i handled the whole thing was to play it cool. I didn't chase but i let her know that i really enjoyed talking to her... Does that make sense? i don't know. \n\nHonestly when i really think about it, this probably isn't a situation where you can use types. Some ESFJs/ENFJs want to be chased and some find a reserved and collected person more intriguing. When i was finally in the relationship with that ENFJ, she said that she thought i was trying to be friends and not interested in anything else. I thought i was too obvious and obnoxious to her.\n\nDo whatever you find is appropriate. You should be prepared though. Fe doesn't treat people like we do. Fe is very loving to pretty much everyone and it can be hard to distinguish if you're one of many or a special snowflake in her eyes. Fi almost have a ranking system for who they adore. \n\nGood luck, it's always a meaningful experience to fall in love or (knock on wood) be rejected. You'll progress!!
1	Hey OP,\n\nESFJ female here. Don't worry about being overbearing, just be yourself.\n\nI know it's cliche, but if you do share mutual feelings for one another, then this should work out just fine :)\n\nRemember that ESFJs desire to know they are loved and appreciated. If you can show that she is precious to you, then you will have won half the battle :)
1	DON'T take things personally.  I have such a hard time with INFPs because the Fi is unfathomable to me.  How they twist things and take them personally boggles my mind.\n\nOpen mind and tough skin.  :-)
5	ESFJs, have you ever had anger management issues?	
2	Not that I know of! I'm a pretty bubbly person though. I think that the only time I ever got mad was when I used to play Mario Kart Wii hahahaha.
1	Yes.  But they only came out with my kids.  :-(  I was never angry with my parents or siblings or friends or students.  Just my kids.  I realized I had this giant host of expectations for them that I didn't anyone else.  It pains me, and I work on it seriously.
4	Isfp crushing on Esfj (21)	Hi, im an isfp male and i have a crush on an esfj girl. We have known eachother since childhood and as long as i can remember she has always been my idea of "the perfect girl". Very cool, easygoing, loving and independant\n\nWe've had two long breaks in our relationship, once when i moved away at 14, and once when her ex got jelous and told her to shut me out at 19.\n\nNow we see eachother every monday (because thats the only day my workschedule allows us to meet) and its always fantastic and great and chill. But whenever we're not meeting in person i feel like she wants nothing to do with me. She rarely respond to texts and when she does she doesnt seem very invested. I do tend to send stupid witty one liners and compliments out of frustration and lack of knowledge in what to do when it comes to conversation, or starting it. \n\nThis girl is as beautiful as she is kind, as smart as she is thoughtfull, and as extraordinary as she is loved. I rarely allow myself to dream (typical isfp self doubt), but this girl makes me sleepless at night. My brain tries to make up worst case scenarios, and they are all equally beautiful and worthwhile.\n\nI doubt she wouldnt be able to see past my very poor facade, so she probably knows i have feelings for her, again. \n\nI myself need constant confirmation to even comprehend that im wanted, but i will never ask for it, as it makes me feel like ive taken something rather than earned it. Its just hard feeling like sje doesnt apriciate me, my forward actions or the barrage of anxt filled compliments. (Last gf dumped me because i placed her too high on the pedestal). \n\nIve told her a lot about myself, how i act and think and what my needs are.\n\nNot to stereotype you wonderful, all loving hate haters. But does anyone feel like they know whats up and what she wants or what i should do? Leave her alone? Keep commiting to her? \n\nI never really allow myself to fall in love so i dont know whats happening or if its just irrational illusions. Any advice is helpfull. \n\nTL;DR : Wall of text, i dont even know. Spastic brain.
3	Have you talked to her about how you feel? Because if not you should! ESFJ's are very open about our feelings so we appreciate outward displays of emotion. While it is nice to send her little one liners or witty comments to let her know you are thinking about her, an open conversation about your feelings might go a lot further. \n\nAlso, I wouldn't read too much into her not responding to your texts. I don't know if this is typical of all ESFJ's but I see texting as a superficial form of communication. I really only text to make plans, but not to have day to day conversation. I would much rather catch up with someone by spending time together (like you guys have been doing).\n\nBest of luck :)\n\nEditted to fix typos :)
6	ESFJs and casual dating	As an ESFJ, I have found that I have a lot of troubles with the casual dating scene. I tend to be very open about my emotions with guys that I'm seeing, and become very insecure when that openness isn't reciprocated which tends to push people away. Anyone else have these same struggles and how did you deal with it?
3	I didn't like casual dating, because it seemed so pointless if I didn't think there was any chance of it developing.  Why should I waste my time having dinner with these people I have no interest in spending long-term time with?  But in the end, I had to think of casual dating as learning about what I wanted, so when I did find that long-term one, I would recognize it faster.  
4	ESFJs and stereotypes!	
1	Are any of you guys Enneagram 3?	I know E2 is fairly common, and probably E9 and E6, but is anyone here E3?
2	Yep. Me.\n\nI'm 3w2 apparently. I'm bored so i took that ennagram thing and that is what I got from that. Fits me fairly well. Heck, I've been hit with some pretty heavy shit in life but I still manage to get my accomplishments no matter how small they may be to other people. I don't give up and determined in a way when I should have given up a long time ago. 
0	To change the face of human psychology completely…	\n\nPsychic mediumship and telepathy is expressed throughout pop culture. What this means is that other human beings are expressing their observations about reality through art. Art is a powerful medium which can heighten awareness in other individuals very quickly. Artists take their own life experiences and inner realities and display them for the public to see. Awareness of ESP is expressed over and over and over again in the artistic world. It's time to own up to the truth and be real: we are all psychic. Telepathy is real, and it should be used well (with kindness). We are all psychic mediums, and when we believe in ourselves, we can connect with the spirit world directly telepathically. We don't need religions, other psychics, or authority figures to tell us what reality is. We have our own observations, and when we open our minds to new information, more confirming experiences about the truth of reality. There is no death. There is a difference between being extremely confident in our observations and expressing this confidence to other people, and being authoritative. Think for yourself. Question authority.

0	Nothing invites attacks from others like a good ole’ post about telepathy or ESP…	\n\nMany of the responses that are received regarding the open discussion of telepathy are not about getting to the truth of what is real or not real regarding ESP, it’s about who the smartest individual is, and who can control how people think the most. The biggest egos that like CONTROL over others are usually the first to attack and discredit. This is true all across the board with other writers that also embrace psychic phenomena, not just with what I have written in the past. Many individuals that write about ESP and psychic functioning are immediately discredited and attacked by arrogant, closed minded, control freaks. They don’t like being figured out, they don’t like losing control, and they don’t like being seen for who they are deep down. Anyone with a negative attitude towards other human beings – those that like authority and control over other people – do not like it when highly aware individuals focus on the emotions that they put out to other people. The truth is this: all of us can sense positive-feeling vibrations, which are emotions and thoughts from other individuals, and all of us can sense bad-feeling vibrations. There is no denying this fact. This information exists everywhere in pop culture. It cannot be hidden and swept under a rug any longer.\n\n Big egos like authority and control, and they don’t much care for individuals that are pushing forward ESP and telepathy, even though it is the truth. We all observe it, and we all experience it. Awareness of ESP empowers the individual that embraces it, and disempowers individuals that seek authority and control over other human beings. Basically it’s like this: when someone starts talking openly about ESP and psychic awareness, big egos and control freaks get really pissed off. And this post will piss a lot of them off, but that’s OK – they need to be more observant with their thoughts, lighten up a bit, and relinquish control over other human beings and how they think. \n\n“Pseudoscience” is a favorite word of the big ego. It’s a vague term that is used quite often to discredit the intelligence and intellect of those that want to study ESP openly. Remote viewing, which is psychic functioning based on telepathy and the ascertainment of data outside of the 5 senses, was developed with the scientific method and double-blind experiments. “Remote viewing” is a science based term that was developed from scientific experiments. This is a fact that cannot be denied. The federal government funded the development and use of remote viewing for intelligence operations, and I have no doubt that it is still being used today. Anyone familiar with quantum mechanics knows about the observer effect, wave/particle duality, and quantum entanglement. Our minds have a DIRECT IMPACT on that of which we observe, and removal of conscious observation of a target or object at a distance collapses the particle into the wave. Our minds perceive in a “non-localized” fashion, and this means that space/time becomes irrelevant when we focus our minds on an object. This is not “pseudoscience”. These are scientific facts. \n\nI want to take this a step further and say that when other individuals think about us, all of us can sense this focus of thought. This is an observation of mine, but it has also been proven scientifically as well. Dr. Dean Radin has studied this phenomenon specifically in a scientific lab setting. It’s real. We don’t really need scientific studies to tell us this is so, however. We have emotional connectivity and personal observation, which lead us to direct experience – something much more powerful. \n\nWhen I write these posts based on telepathy and ESP and post them online, I can immediately sense, via my feelings, when other individuals are reading them. I can FEEL the anger and arrogance and disagreement and the need to discredit what I am writing about. It’s all about control, and many individuals feel intellectually inferior to those that embrace ESP openly and without any doubt. And this is WHY these lower feeling thoughts/emotions are being expressed. Our feelings tell us what kinds of emotions are being directed towards us by other individuals, and because our emotions and thoughts are intrinsically linked, we can tell if other individuals are thinking either positively or negatively about us when they are thinking about us. None of us need the scientific method to know this. We all experience it. When another person is actively thinking about us, we become “emotionally entangled” with that individual, and we can feel what the attitude this individual is expressing towards us. There is no denying this fact of reality. Individuals that are controlling and have poor (authoritative) attitudes towards other individuals do not like it when feelings and emotions are openly discussed. This means they are being figured out for who they are deep down and how they think. Most of the time, their thoughts are not very kind or humble. No one likes it when they are being exposed for who they are deep down, especially when they are mean-spirited, arrogant, and unrefined. All of us can sense good vibes and bad vibes – and these are not just “vibes” (an incredibly vague term used to discredit the perceptions of other individuals) – they are thoughts. Our thoughts determine what kind of “vibes” we are sending out to other people, do you not agree?\n\nAll of us, including myself, have big egos that need refinement in some way. This is humility. When we refuse to judge, and we see each other as growing individuals. I choose to refine my thoughts, and I spend a lot of my free time, asking for no compensation from other people, teaching what I know is true about reality. It takes a lot of time to write posts such as these. Most of the responses are harsh criticisms based out of ego, and not out of honesty and humility. These individuals feel threatened by what I am writing, and they should be if they are unkind and refuse to refine their own egos (the expression of truth and humility). A higher awareness of ESP and telepathy is incredibly threatening to the authoritative control freak that seeks power over other individuals. These behaviors and attitudes are rooted in low self-esteem (the need to be better than other individuals). Most of the responses are harsh criticisms, but I get the sense that there are many more that are thankful for what I am writing, because it puts them into a higher awareness immediately and empowers them. These writings are for those individuals that care about other people, are kind, and do not seek power, control and authority over others.\n\nI expect that, after I post this essay, many will begin to criticize it unfairly and be angry about it. They will most likely express that this post does not belong here, has no relation to MBTI, is off topic, is pseudoscience, has no intellectual bearing on reality itself, or any other putdowns or criticisms they can think of for the purposes of DISCREDITING what I have written. Many will attempt to use sarcasm as a hidden effort to discredit as well. Some individuals may even contact a moderator to block me from posting in the future, because they do not like what I am writing about. These are common reactions from individuals that want to control how other people think and what is being openly expressed. If there is one topic – and one topic only – that stirs the hornet nest the most, it is telepathy and ESP. This is because we are changing reality for what it is, and many individuals are just not ready to grow. They want to keep how they really think towards other people hidden, and remain controlling, judgmental Individuals that are bossy only care about power and authority, the do not care about refining the self. There is a direct correlation between higher intellectual functioning, and kindness, humility and honesty.\n\nI am not writing this to outsmart anyone, but to expose reality for what it is. If you don’t like this essay, NO HARD FEELINGS, OK?\n\nA few points I wanted to make:\n1.	The emotional states of individuals do not traverse space/time. Emotional synchronization between individuals (feelings) is non-localized in nature. All of us can feel love (high emotion thoughts – kindness, honestly, humility), and all of us can feel hate (authority, fear, control, pessimism). We are emotionally connected, and it does not matter how far our bodies are separated. If another person has a negative attitude towards us and is holding us in their thoughts, or if that person is actively thinking about us to communicate, we can feel the direction of their thoughts. Our thoughts are either loving, kind and gentle, or they are not.\n2.	Skepticism regarding ESP does not mean to criticize unendedly. It means that we are also open to the possibility that it is real. If we constantly look for reasons that ESP is not real and put down people that are curious about it, this is not skepticism, this is control. Control can be in the form of derogatory comments, sarcasm, put downs, etc. Skepticism requires us to ask for CLARIFICATION, it does not mean that we detract over and over and over without any sort of objectivity.\n3.	We can sense not only direct thinking (telepathy), but also attitude (our vibe) of other individuals. Our attitude is determined by the habitual thoughts that we have about other people. If we habitually think unkind thoughts, have big egos, and look down on other people, we transmit a low vibe towards other people. We may not be actively thinking about another individual, but that individual will be able to pick up our attitude and current emotional state via feelings quite easily. \n4.	Telepathy is obvious when we stop actively thinking within and start watching the mind. When we stop actively thinking, we will see that the inner conversations and thoughts within our minds still continue. All of us hear these voices. There is no schizophrenia. There is only telepathy. We can all communicate with each other telepathically, and we can also communicate telepathically with the deceased. There is no death.\n\n\nhttps://justinmichaelmeredith.wordpress.com/\n
1	My Father in law has cancer . . .	My wife is an ESFJ.  I'm an INTP.  She is all heart and she loves her father dearly.  He has stage four cancer and while in the hospital for pneumonia his kidneys failed.  Now they're going to try plasmapheresis.  In his state they're not confident he'll survive the procedure.  Now throw in the fact that we are in Hawaii and he's in Texas.  \n\nI know she is barely holding it together.  I'm doing my best to be strong for her, but real empathy is challenging.  I'll miss him as a friend, but I know his suffering will end if he didn't pull through.\n\nHow would y'all want to be supported?  I just want to be as supportive as I can, I guess.  This fucking sucks.  Cancer sucks.
2	Give her a big hug and ask her what she needs from you right now.  Hold her tight, make her dinner and offer to do the laundry, maybe? 
8	ESFJ's! How do I truly thank you?	Hi there! \nI'm BlueImagination, and I'm an INTJ (female).\nOur faculty has recently hired a new head who has turned out to be one of the coolest, most generous, friendly, sarcasm-whipping, butt-kicking ladies of all time. She also happens to be an ESFJ. Her and I have struck up a pretty neat friendship, and her generosity as a boss-lady and a friend has been overwhelming. I wanted you ask you guys if there was a particular form of "thank-you" that really resounds with you? I'm not great at big emotional moments and feel like I'm not getting across how much she's appreciated. Help me out! \nP.S. You're all fantastic. 
7	Tell her why she deserve the thank you. Most importantly, be sincere.
1	For me personally, a heartfelt thank-you card or something homemade like cookies is awesome. The fact that someone thought of me and went out of their way to do something for me is usually what gets the point across the most. I think that I often forget I exist to people outside of when I am present with them, if that makes any sense. Lol I am ALWAYS thinking about people, even if it's just "oh, that reminds me of So-and-So," but I know that others don't do the same. So something to show that they thought of me in a positive way when I wasn't around is really touching! Sorry if that makes no sense - I'm having a hard time putting what I'm thinking into words today!\nP.S. How sweet of you to think of thanking her!
1	Love this question! I wonder if it may be due more to the "5 Love Languages" but the way I best receive appreciation is through words of affirmation and physical touch (i.e. hugs, hand on shoulder). If that kind of touch is inappropriate in the workplace then words of affirmation is more than enough for me! I'm fine with edible gifts, but words mean way more to me than a plate of cookies. Again, I don't know if this applies to ESFJ's more broadly or if it depends more on the individual's love languages vs. their MBTI! :)
1	Late to the game....We like thoughtful, private thank yous. A nice small card or telling her how you honestly appreciate face to face is how to do it. 
3	Please Help - Relationship Dynamics Hell @ Work: ESFJ v. INTJ	Hi,\n\nI'm an INTJ and need some help from my ESFJ friends across the aisle. \n\nAs you can see, we are oppose in 3 traits. I am working on a critical situation and I am reporting to an ESFJ. The relationship dynamics have gone down the drain and it's not strategic for me to allow this to continue.\n\nBeing so opposite, I don't "get" ESFJs.\n\nI was hired as an expert to assist on a large difficult situation. My boss does not understand the field. At all. She is way over her head. Yet she will not dare to admit this. As an INTJ, I even take delight in admitting what I don't know. Being knowledge-seekers were are natural subject matter experts in our chosen fields. I've been doing it for over 20 years. \n\nThe situation above gets exacerbated with an intense, insatiable need for her to feel in control of the situation. I have never in my life being more micromanaged than I am now, and for an expert, this represents hell. I am a super-performer and extremely accountable to deliver excellent work in accordance to the expectations I have set. Even though I have already done this for over 2 months, her insatiability to be in control, to know everything that I am doing, and to not trust me, and to put in her EXTREMELY DETAILED input, is driving me insane. If it was just a matter of entertaining her while I do what I need to do, no problem. However, she wants to see that her input is implemented, that everything she asks is done as she asks it, and does not understand at all the huge implications of her spontaneous decisions.\n\nTo make matters worse, we clash on the N and S. I am Abstract-First - Tangible Second. I seek agreement on the direction and explain the huge implications of things in abstract ways. It's like I'm talking Chinese to her. She wants to see, touch, smell, and feel whatever it is that I am doing. EXCEPT, that I cannot quite give her that when the foundations (which are conceptual first) are not in place. And she has zero patience in my explaining. She labels me as "theoretical". Nothing could be further from the truth. I've managed crises situations that have hundreds of millions of impact. No professor here.\n\nI admit my ignorance (see how I don't care about being wrong?) on how to deal with ESFJs. I do not think, at all, that I am superior. I know I am just different. So please, humbly accept my request for help and tell me, how to deal with someone who shares who is a strong ESFJ and who I cannot help in seeing the light of what needs to be done.\n\nI've tried everything that I know, and I can be extremely accommodating. Nothing has worked. The dynamics have gone down the drain. \n\nIn the meantime the clock is ticking....\n\nTL;DR: Tremendous personality clash between ESFJ boss and INTJ expert are making the work environment a living hell. INTJ has tried everything he knows. Help.
3	Let me know if you find a breakthrough. I am an INTJ boss with two ESFJ people reporting to me. They complain about the workload, stand around talking, and snark/downtalk me. I just want the work done.
1	Geez this sounds awful! I'm not sure exactly how the dynamics are with this project but I know as an esfj how she wants control. I have been accused of being smothering and too controlling. It probably isn't her intention. She might not even realize she is doing it. Could you propose coming together once a week (or if that's too long for an hour at the end of the day) to recap everything you've each done and go over tasks you each need to do next? That way there is a set time set aside for collaboration, recap and planning and she won't feel a need to check in all the time? 
1	20F INTJ here, clashed with a 44F ESFJ late last year. It was ugly, and the place we worked at had no human resources department and when I reported her to my boss, he didn't do anything about it. She was constantly trying to undermine me and wouldn't take direction well (I was her manager). She'd send me emails asking if she can "drop in" when not scheduled just to hang out with people or send me back to back emails minutes apart pleading for my attention, asking to be scheduled more and more. I stopped responding and she'd just "drop in" anyways before I sent her away. Ultimately she was trying to undermine me and get me fired.\n\nI know a lot of people say that any type combination can get along if both of the adults are self-aware and able to work through differences but in this case I really didn't know how to approach her. My ESFJ nit-picked absolutely everything and when I did try to step back and explain things to her in a clear and concise manner, it still didn't register with her.\n\nI still pick that part of my brain trying to figure out what went wrong, but I think about it less and less now because I was making myself miserable over someone who isn't worth it. I'll never have to work with her again but I still see it as a huge failure in my young career. What helped me during this time - even when she'd just "drop in" - was my not responding to her. I limited her as best I could. I found that anytime I'd just her even a small task she wouldn't do it the way I'd like it to be, and if I explained it to her, she'd get frustrated because "that's not what she's used to". I try to find the positives in the experience too, for future reference. I appreciate how down-to-earth ESFJs can be and it is sobering. Our perspectives were different in the respect of our clients as well, a bit like the good cop/bad cop thing (but she was trying to impose bad cop a bit too much on me). I also liked how she could work with a schedule and could show up on time. I guess that's my takeaway. You might also want to try to look for the positives in your very contrasting relationships so even if this conflict results in some kind of change in the work arrangement, you can be better suited for the future.
1	Have you told her your thoughts that you are telling us now? If not, the onus is on you. You should be telling her what you don't like about her management style and what you would like instead. This doesn't seem like a personality clash, more like a social competency clash. You need to tell her what you want from her in a professional way and you haven't done that.\n
1	ESFJ here :)\n\nI can't say that I have a solid solution here for you, but I just worked with an INTJ for thirty, 10-hr days straight and I think I can assist you, a least a little bit, with your issues here. I know this post is a tad old, but whatever.  \n\nI actually adore that INTJ...can't stop talking about him. He was so great. ANYWAY. \n\nOkay, here's what she see's you as:\n\nQuiet, meticulous, and a curiosity. She (like you) is overwhelmed with trying to figure you out, and the weight she is already carrying is enough to wipe her out, let alone deal with and try to understand (essentially) an alien that she's somehow in charge of.\n\nShe probably feels under qualified, and just wants to please whoever's upstairs. She feels like she's sucking at her job, and wonders if it's worth continuing.\n\nUnlike the beautiful INTJ mind, when the ESFJ mind panics, it's obvious externally. Try and remember that for better or worse, sometimes we ESFJs succumb to worrying about how our lack of control may appear to those we are trying to please.\n\nIf we feel as though people see how we are struggling, we fold. Instantly.\n\nThe good news for you is (I hope), that her behaviour and how she treats you is absolutely nothing to do with what you've done and how you've corresponded with her. I would bet that you've performed far beyond expectations (probably blown them out the water).\n\nTruth to be told, she probably gravitates to you because you're chill and focused...something she is desperately lacking in her own life. \n\nI often found myself struggling to make conversation with my INTJ colleague, because he was so relaxed and I had to learn to be comfortable with silence.\n\nHe found this hilarious when I mentioned this, and joked that it was no wonder I was stressed all the time-I felt the need to always talk! \n\nThe reason she is nitpicky is because she probably feels she HAS to be in order to appear in control. Clearly this is unnecessary.\n\nHope this helps...I'm afraid we're 12-13% of the population, so you're bound to bump into another one of us...sorry :p\n\n 
2	What are you listening to?	Hola fellow ESFJ's!\n\nI'm curious, what kind of music have you been listening to lately? What are your 3 most replayed songs at the moment?\n\nHere are my 3 right now :)\n\n1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsoUa1DuDW4 (I also really like the Abstract - Neverland remix, but I don't think that version includes the whole story.)\n\n2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t2tjNqGyJI\n\n3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqCyD6DcCX0
1	Questions on Decision making (short answer) (xpost /r/mbti)	
7	Functions	**Dominant Fe (EXFJ)**: I am warm and enjoy taking care of people. I consider how decisions will impact everyone involved. Is there anything I can get you, to make you feel more comfortable? I can’t be with people who don’t treat others with respect. I want to acknowledge not only what each of you has done in the group as individuals, but also talk about what we can do, or have done, together! You did an awesome job with that; you are so talented. I don’t approve of what you are doing, because it’s inappropriate and will have a bad impact on others, but I am willing to talk it through and will accept your apology, without any bad feelings. I feel so at ease offering affirmation, and am deeply hurt when others don’t do the same. I want everyone to be happy, but am not afraid to say what I feel if I need to.\n\n**Auxiliary Si (ESXJ)**: The last time I tackled this project, using this technique worked, so I feel confident in my ability to succeed using the same technique. This restaurant is laid out different than it was the last time I was here; those tables were on the patio, and they had red curtains, not green. I’m happy to provide you with the details of why I am making this decision. I recognize this street, so I know where to turn! This holiday is meaningful to me, because it allows me to connect to my family or my culture. I’m disappointed if we can’t celebrate it together every year. If we’re going to do this project, let’s do research to see how others have done it before we start. I like to reflect on my own past experiences when making decisions in the present, and believe I can learn from others’ mistakes.\n\n**Tertiary Ne (ESXJ)**: Oh, that new idea is interesting! I’d like to talk about it with you! But I need to be somewhere in twenty minutes, so let’s keep it on track as much as we can. It feels like you are not tied to reality with this idea; can we pull it back to something tangible? I think I have several ideas as to what really happened back there. This discovery may help me discover my greater purpose in life. I suspected this was going to happen…\n\n**Inferior Ti (EXFJ)**: I want to be objective in our conversation, but I’m having a hard time not feeling upset that you have shut me out. I don’t feel comfortable discussing this person like they are a thing or a problem to be solved. How can you be so detached? That feels heartless to me! I want to get things right, so I will study this until I understand it, then take what I know and use it to help others reach their own understanding. I’m okay with calling a problem a problem, and willing to analyze it.\n\nSource: http://funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/cognitivefunctions
4	[Master Personality Typology Survey] I'm conducting a survey to analyze correlations between popular personality typologies, and I need a lot more ESFJs in it!	
1	I am always too slow! Haha
3	In need of assistance.	I'm an INTJ, but I need a bit of help understanding all you ESFJ's. I figured that this subreddit would be more appropriate than INTJ, so sorry if it isn't. Either way, I am confused about how your personality type makes decisions. For me, I find it overwhelmingly difficult to make any sort of decision without having some sort of logical pathway/plan. It confounds me how you are able to make decisions without some sort of analytical basis to make your decision upon.
7	I don't know if I can speak for all ESFJ's here, but I'll do my best to explain how I make decisions. :p How I make decisions usually depends on the gravity of the decision. For smaller things I usually make it quick and bring it back to my core values. & For bigger decisions, I will spend a few hours doing some research, go through the pros and cons of my decision, do some more research :p, ask family and friends what they would do and what they think of my decision so far and then lastly spend time alone to think about how the decision will fit into my overall plan in life. ^Run on sentence ftw. :D So in other words, if the decision will have a big impact on my life, I will spend a boatload of time analyzing the different options I have and picture where each decision would lead me to in the end. Then I spend what feels like an eternity to pick the one I feel will help me get to where I want to be/who I want to be most effectively. In general, I also spend a lot of time thinking about how my decisions will affect the people close to me. Hope that helps.
1	How do you know they don't have a path of reason when they make decisions? They could but just not tell you or find it hard to articulate. Just because you don't understand their reasons for a decision doesn't mean it's baseless. You should be asking them why they decided on what they did instead of overanalyzing them in your head. This isn't a personality problem, it's a social competency problem.

0	Company assigning employees to teams based on their personality?	Back when i was in college and as part of their recruitment process, I took a personality test before getting an offer letter from a company. There was no result or description of my personality after the test completed - the results were just sent to the company \n\nAnyhow, now I have reasons to believe that the company divides it's employees into teams based on the test results. \n\n(i)There were two sides to the office - one was a lot smaller than the other, I was in the smaller side. \n\n(ii)Now that I look back, 100% of the interns on the smaller side were introverts - that number is about 70-80% for other employees. \n\n(iii) R&D department was on the smaller side along with two other teams and Susan Cain has mentioned t in her book hat companies fill their R&D departments with introverts. \n\n(iv) All the events (eg. Fun Friday) were organized on the bigger side - it was optional for everyone - but since we were in the other side, it was easier for us to concentrate on our work.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?
2	At my work we did a personality test prior to being hired, and a strengths quiz after being hired.  This allowed my company to build a team of people with varying skills and strengths, which helps us look at problems together from all angles and provide better solutions for our clients.  It actually works really great for us, but we're a pretty small company.  I don't think its a bad thing for companies to do, provided it isn't used to NOT hire a type of person.  
3	What do you enjoy doing?	As an ESFJ college student I'm looking for anything new and exciting/joyful/fun/thoroughly enjoyable. \nWhat is joyful for you? What is something that you thoroughly enjoy? What do you like to do most? Ideally, in your free time, what would you love to be doing?\nI'm also curious to see if your interests are similar to my interests, so please post anything you guys really enjoy!\nYou are greatly appreciated :) 
1	For me personally, I don't care too much about what I'm doing so long as I'm doing it with people I care about. So, watching tv series, movies, biking, trying out new restaurants, learning a new language are all things that I love to do, but maybe wouldn't enjoy as much as I do now if I wouldn't have someone to do them with. When I'm alone though, I really enjoy watching health documentaries, reading some awesome fiction books or baking. Basically everyone in my family is an introvert so that may factor into my specific interests as well, I don't know. :p What are some things you enjoy? :)
4	Hi there, people ! I'm hear to discuss the idea of a Quadrant chat !	In Jungian theory, types are divided into 4 Quadrants : Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta.\n\nNTPs and SFJs form the Alpha quadrant : We all use consciously Ti Ne Si and Fe functions.\n\n[Someone](/u/Hayarotle) on /r/entp thought about [making a chat for the Alpha quadrant](/r/entp/40jlg0/).\n\nSo :\n\n * What do you think of that ?\n\n * Do you want to make it real and chat a bit ?\n\n * Which chat system you prefer ? (Discord, IRC, something else ?)\n \n * Can you bring some ISFJs with you ? (NTPs are not people I would qualify "difficult to find. =) )\n\nIn any case, have a nice day ! Cheers !
6	Just took a cognitive profile test for the first time. I found out I'm an ESFJ. What exactly does this mean?	I recently took the test and was curious what all this means? I think I have a basic understanding of what it means to be an ESFJ, but I was hoping that some of you could help me have a better understanding of this and all the other stuff cognitive profile stuff.\n\nSorry if this doesn't make much sense and Thank you in advance for all the help!
4	I'm an INTJ, but I'll help out nonetheless, since the ESFJ sub isn't nearly as active as some of the other ones. If you want to talk about MBTI, r/intj , r/intp , r/mbti , r/entp, , r/infj , r/entj , and r/infp are probably the ones that are most frequented, and the people talk no matter what your type is.\n\nWell, the MBTI is basically a psychological outline that explains how you perceive information. \n\nThe cognitive functions are the functions that you use to perceive, and you have four of them: two introverted, and two extraverted. Your first function, Extraverted feeling (Fe) is your dominant function. Fe is considerate and group based, as it is extraverted, and usually means that your moral system is most likely traditional and based off of societal standards. \n\nYou next function is introverted sensing (auxiliary function), or Si. Si reviews facts and data from past experience and compares it to the current one to see similarities or differences, and that produces a clear and accurate idea or goal. \n\nThen is extraverted intuition, or Ne (tertiary function). This can best be described as a "brainstorm function," which kind of bounces ideas around about anything and everything to look for interconnections and the like.\n\nLast is your inferior function, introverted thinking, or Ti. Ti cares about logical consistency internally, and it analyzes things within certain principles. So, inside of your head, it'd be something like: "hm, what are all of the parts that makes this up, and what happens if they get moved around, blah, blah, blah."\n\nPut all of those together and that is basically what it means to be an ESFJ. MBTI isn't like a horoscope or anything, but it's an outline, and there are certain generalizations and stereotypes about each type that you could or could not agree with.\n\nI would really suggest looking at this video by Michael Pierce. He has a really good grasp on the types and their functions, better than I do, and they are all really enlightening and will explain things better than I can:   \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8UBvtcBFvM\n\nThere are other sites out there, if you care, like 16personalities, keys2cognition, cognitiveprocesses, and things like that if you want more profiles or explanations, but I'd suggest looking at the video, mainly.\n
2	http://www.typeinmind.com/fesi/ \n\nCheck out the above description of your type written by your type. 
-1	It means nothing, you are still you, no one else but yourself.
4	Are there actually esfj's out here?	Just realised that ESFJ's are said to be 10+% of the world population, yet this MBTI is empty.... isn't that very surprising?
7	We're too busy socializing :)
3	This might just be me, but I almost always prefer talking with people in person over typing stuff out. I feel like when I'm talking with someone face to face I'm less likely to be misunderstood :p idk... anyways, there are a lot more ESFJ's on personality cafe if you'd like to see some in action. :pp In general, I feel like most ESFJ's out there have probably just never heard about MBTI, or don't really care about getting into the details of their personality type. What are your thoughts?
2	There are lots of us 
2	Reddit is not really a personally social site, something like facebook would better suit ESFJ's. Where as someone like me (INTP) as far as I know the most introverted of us all, would find redidt more appealing, with the real lack of actual human contact allows us to talk to others without actually talking to others. Thats why the ESFJ sub reddit is relatively quiet, despite the amount of ESFJ's out there. In comparison to the INTP sub reddit, there are more active users, especially in contrast to the amount of INTP's out there.
1	Actually, this data is highly inaccurate, because 1) most of the statistics are from the eighties (!!!) up to 21st century, 2) referring to the particular group of people e.g in the USA (!!!), in XYZ high school etc. What about other countries? Different cultures, different upbringing! Imo, now, with our society constantly evolving, I believe that actually the Intuitives are more common. More and more people from younger generations are introverted, spending their time in front of a computer or doing nothing (dreaming, duh). You say there’s so many Sensors out there? I disagree.
2	Hey guys, what does your handwriting look like?	"Wait a minute, this doesn't belong here!"\n\nOn the contrary, yes it does! I'm conducting an experiment to see if there is any correlation between the types and their handwritings. They say that handwriting is one of the keys to your personality since your brain controls your hand right?\n\nAnyways, I would really appreciate some samples! Thanks! Don't forget to mention your type (if you are a person lurking on another type's sub of course!)

1	I'd love to know what you found in this experiment. 
3	ESFJ/ENFJ dating ESFJ?	Any ESFJ or ENFJ have experience dating an ESFJ and wouldn't mind sharing his/her experiences with us? Just curious since I am currently dating an ESFJ and I test ESFJ/ENFJ.
2	I have a close friend (ESFJ) who married another ESFJ. They're one of the happiest, most sickly-sweet couples I've ever seen.
1	No, but I'd love to date the same personality type (probably). 
1	ENFP - ESFJ Friendship	My very best friend is an ESFJ and we get along smashingly well. Throughout university she'd be the one to wake me up for classes and cook dinner for the roomies. Her practical side definitely balanced out my free-spiritedness. We always have fun when we go out because we have no problem hitting the dance floor, meeting new people or doing our own thing. \n\nDo any of you have ENFP friends? If so what is your relationship like with them?
3	How important is body language to you?	I went out with an ESFJ yesterday and what I noticed is that she reads body language very well.\n\nDo you find yourself constantly reading people and their motives? What goes through your mind when meeting new people?
2	Body language is probably one of the single most important things when conveying a message to someone. You can tell if they are lying or telling the truth, nervous or confident, etc. It also is essential for portraying yourself.\n\nAs a matter of fact, body language is almost the only thing I have to judge someone new.\n\n-ENTJ
0	An introverts' perspective on Extroverts with a million friends!	
0	In all fair ness, it does seem to me extroverts *make* friends a bit easier than introverts, especially a on the surface likeable person.
0	New subreddit for MBTI discussion. Who wants to join?	I have created a new subreddit to discuss MBTI and make new friends/meet new people.  If you are looking to chat with a certain type or just want to chat about anything and everything MBTI, this is the right place.  Anyone is welcome.
1	Trying to figure out if someone is ESFJ or ENFJ, please help!	I'm INTJ, and my crush, 25 m, took the test recently for the first time and came out ESTJ. I could have sworn he's xNFx, so I thought maybe ENFJ? Idk, the more I read up on the two, the more I'm convinced he's ENFJ, but perhaps he has developed his Si and Ti. I have asked other redditors, and someone suggested that he may be ESFJ. Perhaps you can give some insight. So here's what I know so far.\n\n\nWhile he does act like an ESTJ in that he tends to judge people at work based on their compliance and respect for, schedules and procedures. He's got a lot going on since he works full time, he tries to keep a really regular schedule of stuff he needs to do outside of work (laundry day, college classes, study time, and usually calling me at the end of the day and we talk for a couple hours).\n\n\nHowever, he's always very expressive, and  when he tells a story he usually explains everything surrounding/leading up to the story before he gets to the actual story, and he usually describes his overall impression and how he felt about what happened. He bought a book on watchmaking, and pretty much immediately started reading and applying what he learned to watch repairs. He's really good with numbers and math, and is currently taking a class in differential equations (I'm not sure if that's uncharacteristic of ENFJs, but it seems like understanding systems like that is typically an N thing). He was taught how to cook from a young age, and the way he talks about it, he actually enjoys it. We've been friends for almost 2 years, but things have only started to progress in the past couple months and now when I see him he is very into physical contact (e.g. hugging me, touching my arm, dancing with me pretty much all night). I was invited to a small gathering, and when the hosts wanted to get everyone dancing, and he was the first to start the dancing. He fixed me some food, and I got food poisoning and he took care of me. Usually when there's a "milestone" in our relationship (like talking on the phone during the recent eclipse), he says, "Are we having a moment!? :D" and seems really excited about the progress in our relationship. Whenever I start to wonder if I should tell him something, he always encourages me to be open with him. In fact, when I asked what he wanted me to tell him, he specifically said, "Everything! I want to know everything you're thinking about!" He seems to really enjoy when I open up to him, especially when it's uncomfortable and vulnerable (which is scary for me, an INTJ). He said something about how it shows trust? He said he's typically really good at reading people, but these days he makes a conscious effort not do it anymore because he feels like he knows too much about the person and it can being upsetting sometimes. And the last reason I think he's ENFJ is he is a slut for the Confucius meme, lol, which I've heard ENFJs are really into memes.\n\n\nI've asked ESTJ redditors what they think, and it seems the consensus is that he's definitely not a hardcore ESTJ. \n\n\nHere's what one redditor said about where the ESFJ and ENFJ overlap:\n>they're both really warm, interested in people, interested in improving the lives and good feels of people, value group consensus, tend to have large social support networks, etc. They also prefer to parse the particulars of information rather than simply being concerned with what works. They look for "the best way" to do things. Both types tend to be extremely hard working.\n\n\n**TL;DR** Does anyone else find that they tend to act like an ENFJ? How can I determine if he is ESFJ or ENFJ for sure? What do you feel like your biggest differences are with ENFJs?
1	He isn't an ESFJ for sure.  If he is an ENFJ he should be passionate about some bigger picture issues even if they may be illogical.  He would also be interested in many forms of art and get distracted by many different interests and ideas.  But ultimately the biggest difference is an ENFJ will make decisions from their "heart" or intuition rather than logic or analysis. 
2	Strong Fe users! Advice please?	I am an ENTP (tertiary Fe), and I find it pretty difficult to handle emotionally manipulative people.\n\nI tend to kind of just walk away, as I’m not sure what I could say to remedy the situation (YOU REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FE).\n\nAny of you strong Fe users have any ideas for gracefully dealing with these types of situations? Thanks :)
3	Practice sprinting technique.  Once you come across one, put practice to good use.
1	Could you be more specific? What are you looking to get out of interacting with these manipulators? 
2	Hey there ESFJ's I'm making a chat for the "Sentinels" type personalities (ISTJ, ISFJ, ESTJ and ESFJ) come join us	Greetings ESFJs.\n\nI'm creating a Skype chat for people who fit into the role of the "Sentinels" which according the the [16-personalities website](http://www.16personalities.com/articles/our-theory) "Highly practical embracing and creating order and security and stability wherever they go." \n\nIn theory Sentinels tend to enjoy each others company and have common goals. So I thought I'd create a chat to see if this is true. So come join us.  \n\n\nHere is the Skype link to join the group: \nhttps://join.skype.com/vsBD6BebPjtH\n\nOr you can contact me directly if you have questions and i'll add you to it directly.\n\nMy Username: kaspeey\n
13	Views on INTPs?	
13	I've only had the opportunity to meet a few (2) and both of them have been extremely intelligent.  Their view of the world steams from a desire to strip away everything that is not essential to the bigger point and the most objective truth. They tended to be lazy in day to day matters because in the long run it simply didn't matter to them or to their larger conceptualization of the universe.  They are probably the type most likely to accidnetly slip into an academic lecture on their topic of interest and redefine their surroundings based on abstract and logical frameworks.  They were refreshing to be around because they brought a unique and meaningful view of the world to the table.
11	We mean well.. I think.\n\n^^^Why ^^^am ^^^I ^^^here?
3	I'm an INTP. My mother just tested as ESFJ. Not sure how that happened, we're pretty much opposites.
3	I'm dating an ESFJ. We are complete opposites in so many ways but it feels more balanced and harmonized instead of clashing, in both of our opinions.
2	ESFJ - The Type That Never Offends	In my dealings with ESFJs, I have found that, unless they are in a very rare and poor mood, it is near impossible to be offended by an ESFJ. \n\nESFJs do not seem to have any natural behaviors or thought processes that rub people the wrong way. They also tend to float on the surface when it comes to analyzing situations, and perhaps this helps them get along with so many people. The deeper, more personal and (potentially) hurtful ideas that could upset someone generally do not occur to the ESFJ. \n\nAnd yet, most all ESFJs I know have expressed that they make an effort to be kind and optimistic in their dealings with others. The items on their self-improvement list are related to being even better at interacting with others.\n\nIs being kind a focused task, or just a way of life you embrace without much thought behind it?
7	Its not necessarily being kind, as it is making as many people happy so that we can be happy (potayto potaato?).\n\nFor me, I'm not really happy unless everyone else involved is happy. So if I make a decision that makes someone in my group upset, I get upset that I did that, and immediately try to make it right. That also tends to make me a worry wort. \n\nAs far as the floating on the surface of situations or issues, I would say (for me) that it only seems that way to others. For me I over analyze every situation, but because I want to make the most people happy, I choose the option that makes this happen. So it may come across as we're just floating there, but really its the opposite, again, for me anyways.
3	speaking only from my own experience, I'd definitely say that the perception of ESFJ's as inoffensive doormats is a misguided one. if we are a) comfortable enough with our company and b) feel as though our values or Si-based web of "truths" have been violated, the flip switches dramatically. While we ESFJ's try to be as nice as possible as often as possible, we aren't all peaches and cream. We try though. We try.
2	My wife is an ESFJ. While she is very kind and wouldn't offend anyone on purpose, she definitely is not a doormat. She doesn't back down for anyone if she's convinced that she's right. I (an INTP) have often suggested that confronting certain dysfunctional people isn't worth the effort. Sometimes I'm right but usually she is.\n\nKeep in mind that these were mentally unstable people that were known for acting in nasty ways. While, yes, she had good intentions in her actions she was fully aware that what she was doing had a possibility of bad outcomes.
2	I don't think I float on surface when it comes to analyzing situations. I am very aware of the people I am talking to. I work in an environment where most people are my political opposites. They know this, they love to talk politics, and they still like me a lot. It's because I know how to talk to them without being offensive and I know where the boundaries are. I know when someone starts saying something super crazy, it's time to laugh it off and say something like "oh, I don't know about that.." and change the subject to sports or whatever. \n\nThere have been plenty of times when I've had to stand my ground about something, but I don't really get hot headed.
2	I'm an INTJ and my two best friends are ESFJs and they are some of the most loudmouthed, savagely mean, and brutally honest people I have ever had the pure, unadulterated delight of knowing in my entire life.\n\nI would not, even for a second, describe them as negative; they are some of the most put-together adults I have ever met, but they take *no* shit from *no*one.\n\nAnd it is so fun to watch. :D
1	A lot of my need to make others happy came from how I grew up. If another member of my household wasn't happy, it would get taken out on me, so I just learned to do everything I can to not step on others' toes and to keep people happy. It's how I've learned to survive. Edit: I wouldn't say we just "float on the surface," when analyzing situations, I would say that we can definitely read and analyze situations really well, and at least for myself, I default to "how do I make this person not upset with me?" as a response, no matter what the situation is. I have learned to start standing up for myself if I've been wronged, however.\n
1	I have been offended by by ESFJ not letting me do my system which worked and then they told me stop because it was not theirs, that was their reasoning.      
1	Any ESFJ who have dated/are dating an INFJ?	Everything feels natural and easy and we're exclusive after the second date. I want to make sure I don't mess this up (because I genuinely like the guy; I'm female) and could really use some tips. (read as: I don't want to smother the dude.)\n\nCan I please have some advice? I like him a lot and want to make this work. I've posted in /r/infj and got "give him space" which I've taken to heart - seeing as I can sometimes be quite introverted too. 
3	INFJ here. I'm afraid I did not see your thread on /r/infj. Personally, and with a little bit of experience, the best way to "not mess up" your time with an INFJ guy is to be genuine. Please show him your emotional vulnerability. Transparency will make him fall/stay in love with you, for all INFJs for that matter. Honesty please.
1	I'm married to one. If you have specific questions, feel free to ask here or pm me.  I could just ask her about stuff I do that she doesn't like and warn you, haha. I'm male ESFJ married to a female INFJ.

3	MBTI Skype Group - Come balance out all the INxxs!	Greetings y'all!\n\nI've been running an MBTI themed Skype group for about 3 months now, and it's been a great experience. A really fun and supportive community grew out of it, and the core members have gradually formed a close group of friends.\n\nConversation is largely casual, but tends to dip into the abstract. Consciousness, morality, metaphysics, psychedelics, and language tend to be pretty big topics. MBTI as well, naturally.\n\nIt's all participant directed, so you can take it into whatever domain you're interested in. If you're into some cool niche thing, we'll probably want to hear about it.\n\nWe mainly talk through text chat, which is sporadic throughout the day, but if we can drum up enough interest we do voice/video calls as well. If you're shy, there's no pressure to join voice calls.\n\nI think ESFJs are an excellent type to have around in any social group - beyond their well known ability to bring people together, they're often gifted with a no-nonsense insight into human nature. I've been lucky to know a few across the course of my life, and I'd very much like to meet a few more.\n\n**If you think you'd be interested, send me a PM with your age, gender, MBTI type, and a short self description (interests, hobbies, etc) so I can get a sense for you.**\n\nHope to meet you guys soon!\n
2	It's Friday ladies and gentleman !	It's Friday.... Today my plans are to finish up class. Then go over to this store called "world market" to check out their wine and beer section. (They have all imported merch. Big variety) \n    After coming back from Germany in August all beer I have had is TERRIBLE. I deeply miss all of the German brews.. Let's hope this place carries at least 1. FYI -Munich had the best beer IMO. \nYour plans ? 
2	Having a bunch of friends over for a get other. Saturday maybe getting my hair cut. Sunday, NOTHING!!
1	Husband and I had social plans that fell through. He asked me to be flexible with what we do tonight (I'm not always flexible) and I responded with, "I will plan on being spontaneous tonight." So no clue!
1	Ah yes, German beer is nice but Belgian is even better, I think.\n\nMy plans are simple - relaxing at home after a tiring week. I honestly ran out of energy to go out/go to the gym. Tomorrow, however, I'm going to a gig and afterwards I'm going to eat some Ben&Jerry's. :D
0	Come claim your refugees, please.	
3	How to tell if an ESFJ likes you / cuddling extravaganza?	Hi! ENTP here. I'm trying to understand a friend whom I categorise an ENFJ (he refuses to do the test, is that a common resistance?) - so obviously the characterisation isn't necessarily 100%. Anyway.\n\nThis person is the sweetest being on the planet. We've had this sudden friendship that I'm finding hard to wrap my head around. We basically met up for movies, I slept there, and now we sleep over like four nights a week. We've got startling amounts of physical intimacy, but it's not necessarily.. sexual. How do I describe this.. He kisses me, lots of touchy feely but it's not in erogenous zones/on the lips. HOWEVER he's made indications of RELATIONSHIP interests. I'm not about to jump into a relationship just because this person is the best cuddler in the world, but how do I know that's what he's out for? Is it normal for ESFJs to not go for the obvious sexual opportunities in this relationship? Because I would be open for a casual sexual relationship but not really for emotional investment. I don't want him to work towards a relationship only to be hurt by me. \n\nI also wonder about his intentions, as ESFJs are supposed to be quite aware of social norms, and the barrage of inquiries about our relationship status must annoy him as much as it annoys me. \n\nAny ideas? 
2	Talk to him. You need to have a clarifying conversation about what this is before you continue it.
1	Yeah, definitely talk to him. I wouldn't cuddle *just because* but idk.
4	Sunday Shenanigans!	Hello fellow ESFJs. What have you been up to lately?
2	Just subscribed to this subreddit because I didn't know it existed till now :) \n\nUsual college student shenanigans. Took up archery this semester and it's been fantastic so far! 
3	Tell me some general social rules/boundaries.	I'm an ENTP and was wondering, what are some general social rules/boundaries. No, don't say, be nice, don't do drugs, don't stand too close in the elevator/line, or, there's the *one stall away* rule. Just throw a few out there. What better way to find out than from one of the most social people in the planet? ENTPs aren't necessarily social, they just get mental stimulation from being people, so I wanted to ask you guys.
4	Pay attention to your surroundings. Notice if you're in someone's way in the grocery store. When you talk to people, try to picture how they're feeling and why. Don't assume a bad mood from someone else is your fault. People love to be remembered, so remember details. "Hey, how was your camping trip with your in-laws?" My most valued tip is to make people feel understood. If someone tells you about how hard their shift was, a simple, "wow, it sounds like you had a long, tiring day" will help them to feel understood.
2	Why do you ESFJs gossip so much?	I'm an ENTP and this has no resentment behind it at all -- it's a truly objective question as to *why* you guys like gossip so much, then get hurt when other people do the same to you. I know that talking about imperialism and communism is boring, so I don't condemn anybody for wanting to avoid the subject, but the vapidness of gossiping while you all try to be so positive and helpful is a bit hypocritical, no, maybe?\n\nThis is by no means a personal attack, I just am truly fascinated as to why and what better way to find out than to ask?
6	I'm married to an ESFJ and from what I've seen she doesn't gossip about people unless they've hurt her in some way in the past. Yes, she talks about people a lot but she generally has more positive things to say about people than negative.
3	[deleted]
3	I don't think they gossip "while" they are trying to be positive and helpful - literally yes, but looking into it a bit deeper, ESFJ really is the type that usually always tries to to the right thing and put the needs of others before their own, which more often than not ends up unappreciated, so they feel frustrated and the only way they can get the frustration out in a socially acceptable way is to let it all out and gossip the people who wronged them.\nI had an ESFJ coworker who was an exceptional performer at her workplace, she knew and worked way more than her superiors, but their pay was twice or 3 times as high as hers - she would do all the work and they would take all the credit, and she would often correct other coworkers' mistakes without receiving any reward or recognition for it, because she felt it was her duty to do so, and other coworkers would use that to their advantage and try to make her do their work instead of them on a daily basis.\nSo what could she do about her frustration other than gossip? If I (an ESFP) had the same problem, I would play nice and stupid and slack around, working not a sprinkle more than I'm payed for, subtly making sure that everyone who tries to make me do their work instead of them knows that they can shove that idea up their ass cause they'd have a better chance of making that plant on their desk doing their work instead of them than of making me do it.\nAnd yet ESFJs are the "bad guys" because they gossip, and ESFPs aren't because they're always so positive and fun....if you judged people by their deeds rather than by their words, you would probably have a different impression about ESFJs.\n
3	INTP here, your friend the dual. Fwiw, studies have shown that gossip is an effective form of group bonding, and allows others to experience a social situation vicariously through a friend. My mother is an ESFJ and I can say I know a lot about whats going on with other people that I never would have cared for, but that I prefer knowing to not knowing.  Accepting the premise that certain items of conversation are public domain to all aquaintences, gossip is a form of communication through a medium of other people .\n\nI would say problems related to gossip are like problems related to driving: Driving isn't bad, but driving like a moron will kill someone, and some people do that anyway.\n\n*I'll show myself the way out*...
2	I like to gossip in the confinement of my tight friend group. I mean who doesn't like witnessing a train wreck from afar?
1	I don't gossip about people, I just speak honestly about anything I'm asked. Don't expect us to keep secrets unless we're specifically told to.

3	How do I let my ESFJ best friend I have feelings for him?	Edit: How do I let him KNOW? Dang it, I missed a word in my title -_-\n\n\nSo am an ENFJ and female.\n\nAlso good to note that he is ESFJ but his percentages all are pretty low and that he tends to act more like an introvert.\n\nOkay we've been best friend since middle school  and we know each other really well. However I'm not sure how to let him know I'm interested in him with out just telling him. I know that if I just went and told him he'd feel pressured to respond right away and I just don't want him to freak about. He is very much a people pleaser. I want to find ways to hint and just put it in his head, let him come to the conclusion that i like him on his own and come to me if he actually likes me and not just cuz because he felt obligated to say he did because I confronted him. \n\nI hope that made sense...\n\n\n\n**So what can I do to let an ESFJ that I'm interested in him? What actions of affection do ESFJs appreciate the most?**\n\n
2	The best thing would probably be to tell him straight away. Speaking for myself, I've always disliked little hints because I was either unsure of myself or oblivious of what was going on. It was easier for me to deal with it all in one go, rather than question what the hell those hints meant. But that might be just me.
1	You could be very very touchy feely, but that may be seen as manipulation. \n\nI am an ESFJ with low percentages as well... As soon as he finds out you like him, he will want to respond quickly; it's unavoidable. \n\nBut being stairs forward and telling him, while saying "don't respond right away if you don't want to." Would be best. 
0	Am I a ESFJ?	TLDR: Am I a jaded ESFJ maybe? How do you all find joy in caring for people?\n\nI feel I fit into ESFJ pretty darn well when I am happy and feeling truly "myself".\n\nI like to have my opinions heard, I think very short term, I use feels first, and I feel there are rules to be followed (although some are ones I made up in my head). Buuuuuuttttttt...\n\nI do not need to get attention. Not a fan of big get togethers or going places with lots of people. I have never had many friends or wanted many, I prefer to be alone most of the time. I can't stand helping people. At this point I hate it. I open my mouth to say something that might help but either get sick to my stomach or think I will just get yelled at so why try. \n\nI also find myself wanting to be taken care of, finding no joy in taking care of other people or things because I always have to. It is not fun, I see it as a thing I have to do before I can be happy. When I can make people happy I get joy but it wanes quickly because I can't make it last.\n\nI get what I consider "my kind gestures" thrown back in my face so I just don't want to talk to anyone anymore. No one listens to my advice or helps me when I struggle. I feel very Henny Penny. As one of the biggest percentages out there, do we all feel this way and are thusly not alone? \n\nThanks for letting me vent ya'll! Air hugs for reading all this!
2	You could still be ESFJ. For some reason the SFJs get generalized as simpletons who exist on this earth only to make people feel comfortable and/or silently judge them. Really the extraverted feeling and introverted sensing means that your feelings are tuned into the ethics and values of the people and society around you, and you perceive the world through how reality affects your inner physicality.\n\nThat might be a bunch of mumbo jumbo, but I hope it might help a little. SFJs in particular get a very limited description in the MBTI community
3	A Shoutout from an ISTJ	WARNING: SUPER LONG POST\n\nI recently had a life-changing experience with an ESFJ. Having not known any ESFJs closely in the past, I was blown away by how genuinely caring she was and how much she made an effort to relate to me. She was also very smart on an intellectual level, as well as being very sharp in terms of street smarts. And she was also very wise, offering general life advice in a sage-like way.\n\nIf you don't mind, let me indulge for a little bit and share my story:\n\nShe is a friend of mine from high school who visited me for a weekend. During the time we were together, we had some very deep conversations about our personalities, our lives, and how we had changed since high school.\n\nShe and I Skype from time to time, and we've spent a fair amount of time talking about her, so this was the first time we really delved into talking about me in great depth.\n\nShe noticed I had changed a lot since high school. I had changed a fair amount physically, but she commented more on how I had changed personality-wise. She said that I seemed more poised and that I carried myself differently. In high school, I was more loud and immature, whereas in college I had definitely grown up and become more mature.\n\nHowever, she commented that the flip side of this was that in high school, people knew who I was. I wasn't popular by any standard, but everyone at least knew who I was. I may have done some dumb stuff, but because people knew me, my good qualities shined through. If I messed around in class, at least most of the class would support me, so my teachers ended up liking me. She said that everyone knew I was smart (brilliant, she said), because I wasn't afraid to show who I was, even if some of the things I did were immature sometimes.\n\nNow, she commented that I had completely turned into an introvert. She said I had reverted into my shell and kept my guard up.\n\nShe was taken aback to learn about certain elements of my personality, some of which had been around since high school. She was surprised by how analytical I was, as I had not shown this side of me in high school (we were close, but not *that* close back then). She didn't realize that I approach the world and all problems I face from a purely analytical standpoint, and that I am constantly thinking, my mind is always running, and I am unable to shut it off.\n\nShe was also surprised to learn how much of a planner and a scheduler I am. I enjoy routine and regularity to a certain degree, and I also enjoy large-scale plans. I reminded her of instances in high school where I had gone out of my way to plan a big event for our class, taking a leadership role on it and seeing it through the finish line. I also enjoy working on personal projects just for fun, like a big Excel spreadsheet to analyze a bunch of data. The love for that sort of analysis was there in high school, however, considering how much more varied I was as a person in high school, the need for regularity was not as great.\n\nI also surprised her with my strong memory. I was able to flash back a number of times to events in high school and remind her of them in precise detail.\n\nThe one detail of my personality that I think she was particularly startled by was how I sometimes learn about and analyze someone without talking to them at all. Either by watching or listening to them, or by looking them up on Facebook, I get a sense for their life without having said a word to them. I mentioned that I have done this to all my friends, including her, and she was noticeably creeped out by this. (In retrospect, probably was TMI. I forgot that we hadn't seen each other in 2½ years, and something like that may not need to be shared. I think it also pushed her in the direction of ending her trip short, amongst other factors.)\n\nShe and I connected over a lot of things though. Family, friends, high school, relationships. I learned a lot about her too and it was very productive.\n\nWe ended up discussing the topic of relationships a lot. She said I seem to be self-pitying myself a lot (something that had slipped out over the course of our conversations during that weekend). I posited that I wasn't sure what else to feel, given my lack of success with girls. I had never had a girlfriend, had only kissed one girl on a chance occurrence, and had never even been on a date. She said that I was too nice, and that comparing myself to my peers will only hurt my self-esteem. She added that given my nature for wanting stability, I didn't offer what girls my age wanted. She said that most of the girls I meet are probably looking for excitement and adventure, and I was mostly looking for something more low-key. I asked why, and she said that girls are often looking for a bad boy, rather than someone more "marriage-material." I pushed further, and she said that this is because of their need for drama or excitement, or in her case, because she had more of a savior complex. I acknowledged that this was probably true, but said it doesn't make it easier in the near-term.\n\nWe also ended up discussing standards. She said that she had all sorts of standards that her ideal husband needed to meet (to the point of extreme specificity). She asked what my standards were for my future wife. I realized I had not even thought about what my potential spouse would need to be like. Outside of "nice" and "good sense of humor," I literally had nothing else that I would consider important, saying my personality is malleable enough to be compatible with a lot of people. She was surprised that I had not given this any thought, as she said that most people she knows at least had a sense of what they were looking for.\n\nWe went on to discuss my one brief fling I had with a girl I met. I revealed to her that a) she was much, much older than me, b) I didn't even really like her at all, and c) that I pretty much just went for it because the opportunity was there. I used a baseball analogy: "When you're a pinch-hitter, you don't get many opportunities. So a strikeout is much worse than if you're in the starting lineup. You have to take advantage of every chance you get." I acknowledged that this sounded like more self-pitying, but I believed it to be true. She said that I need to get more standards for myself, and start thinking about what I really wanted.\n\nThis topic raised a larger issue about the direction my life was headed. I said that I don't like to set goals for myself in general, just doing what I see to be fit at the time. She said having tangible goals is important, as it would allow me to move in a direction that was right for me, rather than sitting in the passenger seat of my life. I said that I have a general sense of where things are going, and don't actually need goals to accomplish anything. She countered that if I don't set goals, I'm not really looking to get anything accomplished with my life.\n\nThe discussion on relationships brought us to the issue of confidence. My friend said that while I have matured, and I have become more career-focused, my attitude almost makes me intimidating to girls, because I'm not as fun or playful and they don't know what they would talk about with me. She said that the lack of confidence is apparent, even based on slight physical cues (slouching, walking with hands in pockets, standing with arms crossed, etc.). She said my job seems to be unfulfilling to me and I'm not enjoying it and getting a lot out of it, plus it comes with long hours, hurting my ability to find confidence outside of my work. She said I need to find ways to improve my confidence, even though it's not that simple, and recommended a couple of Ted Talks to watch.\n\nFinally we got onto talking about high school. I shared some other things from high school, with regards to relationships, friendships, or just general memories that I had thought of. She noticed that I had such a strong and fond recollection of high school, but I hadn't found that in college. She suggested that I regretted my college experience, not because I had made the wrong choice, but because the experience wasn't what I wanted it to be. She also implied I was depressed. While I told her that I didn't feel sad at all, I acknowledged that I really didn't feel anything. She told me that it's not good to be numb to my emotions, and that I needed to open up.\n\nI said that I kept looking forward to meeting up with high school friends, and that spending time with them would be more exciting to be than spending time at my current university. She shared with me that she had a hard time moving past high school too. She was so popular in high school and everyone liked her. To go from that to college, where no one knew her, was a hard transition. She said she was depressed her freshman year of college. She said it would be harder for me, because I had so much fun in high school, in a small town, in my comfort zone, and I went to a big city where I was a nobody, and I quickly became introverted and made no friends freshman year. But she said that it wasn't normal to remain so attached, no matter how close I was to my friends in high school. Despite being so popular in high school, she realized that outside of a couple good friends, no one else was looking back and reminiscing. Everyone was moving on. She would have to do the same. And so would I.\n\nShe said the biggest change for her came when she went to study abroad. She had settled in better sophomore year, making new friends and getting involved with different groups, but when she went to study abroad for a semester, she truly learned more about herself. She became more confident in herself, she learned about who she was and what she wanted to do, and she said words I will never forget. She said, "I'm happy now," as sincerely as she could. I knew she wasn't just saying that to prove a point. I had commented on how much wiser she seemed and how tough she was, and I realized the fact that she came to my city and had no problem navigating for herself, doing what she wanted, without even needing my help, was proof that she was a lot tougher than I really knew.\n\nShe said I needed balance in my life. I had spent three years in college so far doing the same thing, taking the same boring classes, not taking any risks, and now I was turning into a shell of my old self. She said I needed a change, and pushed me to study abroad. I told her that I have too much to do senior year, and that I hadn't planned on studying abroad. She asked how I would feel if I was told I had to drop everything for a year and live in a foreign country. I said that I wouldn't want to do that, because I would want to think about my career and my other commitments. She told me to stop thinking so much and just take a risk and try something new. I would have the rest of my life to play it safe, but this would be the best time to take risks.\n\nShe asked what was holding me back, and when I listed a factor, such as a club, an event, a potential family or friend commitment, she shot them all down, saying that those things could all wait and could all be done later. She said that nothing was worth missing out on a great abroad experience for. She said that I needed to change, and while I could do that in New York during my last semester, she didn't see that happening, given how stubborn I am and how New York has been to me so far. She suggested a change of scenery would do wonders for me. That I would grow so much as a person while I was abroad, meet and connect with people in a completely new environment, and hopefully be happy. She insisted that having an adventure would be a good thing, despite what I might believe. I decided right then and there to study abroad during my final semester of college. I had carefully laid out a four-year plan for college, and followed it to a T. But she made me realize that I needed to throw out the playbook and do something different.\n\nThe last thing she said to me was not to dwell on anything she had said, to just relax and fall asleep (it was 2:00 AM at this point) and think about it later. I had no idea how she knew I was dwelling on it.\n\nShe left a couple hours later to head home in the middle of the night, while I was asleep. I heard her leave. I checked to make sure she was gone, and then I broke down in tears. I cried for nearly two hours. I hadn't cried in two years (the most was when I teared up when I watched *Boyhood*). I thought I had forgotten how. No one has ever been able to break me down like this. I felt emotions that I didn't even realize I had before. I also saw she had written a note on a piece of paper and left it on my desk. I can't read it yet. I'm not emotionally prepared.\n\nI was amazed at how she made an effort to connect with me, learn about and understand me, try to help me, and how warm, astute, and genuine she was. I felt an emotional connection with her that I had never felt with anyone before. After she left, I felt like she had taken a piece of me with her. I just wish I could talk to her more. She didn't even offer me a hug, because I don't think she realized how much I needed it. How much she had made me feel.\n\nESFJs, you guys are wonderful people. Don't ever change. I wish more people knew how genuine you are. I'll say this, if there's one preference I now have when it comes to finding a spouse, it's that I hope she's an ESFJ.\n\n- An ISTJ
2	I do want to know:\n\nHow do I connect with her now? I want to keep talking to her, but I think that she wants to keep our relationship a little more distant. I don't think she'll think it's healthy if I keep talking to her, considering everything she told me about moving on. And I don't know if she was as fascinated to learn so much about me as I was by her.\n\nMy other question is, what can I do for her? How can I show her my support and love the way she did for me? I want to be a part of her life in some way, in a way she wants me to. How can I show I'm always there for her, the way she was with me?
4	Does ESFJ roommate "like" my INFP boyfriend?	I (F, ENFJ) am dating an INFP guy and things are going pretty well. We've been going out about 6 months with no blips so far. I've known the guy for years and years so feel pretty secure with things and I'm enjoying the fact that we're at the stage where I can hang out with all his friends (as well as our mutual friends) and it's all fun and chilled.\n\nNow here's my query.\n\nMy guy's housemate is a lovely, good-looking ESFJ. He's a fun guy to be around and is the best friend you could possibly imagine to my boyfriend. As in, would do ANYTHING for him. They are part of a very close group of friends but even so, there's some special bond between the pair of them that at times seems almost MORE than a bromance... This guy cooks for my boyfriend, plans surprises for him, takes up hobbies my boyfriend has to spend more time with him. He misses my boyfriend when he's away to the extent that my guy is reluctant to take too many weekend trips with me or even his family. (I don't mind this; it's important he hangs out with his friends!) \n\nApparently at university people referred to them as a 'couple' and the other night one of their friends drunkenly asked me if I thought the roommate might have a 'thing' for my boyfriend! I was drunk, and brought that comment up with my bf when we got home (maybe I shouldn't have done). He said it is something he had thought about, and was worried that if his best friend does like him, then it might all be a bit painful for him. \n\nThe weird thing is, whilst on the one hand I see how he totally seems into my boyfriend, I sort of get the impression sometimes he is into... me!? We are very similar and like a lot of the same stuff and often have a laugh together. He's increasingly complimentary of me and... I don't know. :/ Sometimes it's just a sense you get. \n\nNow I gather that ESFJ's are usually considered the life and soul of the party so this might just seem like he's a general flirt or whatever... but my guy's roommate is pretty shy - actuallly borderline introvert. He's never had a girlfriend (he's 23) and is pretty shy around girls, though he talks about wanting a girlfriend a lot. He's super good-looking but when I asked him once he said he just assumed hot girls wouldn't look twice at him. \n\nSo what's going on? Anything? Nothing? Does he like my boyfriend? Or is he maybe even a bit into me? Essentially what I want to know, ESFJs, is: is this a personality thing!?\n\nPS. I'm not looking for drama, I'm just super curious!
3	We made an MBTI group chat and would love for you guys to join!	Hey ESFJs, we made a groupchat on groupme and would love for you to join!\n\nhttps://groupme.com/join_group/14593377/1y4sFa\n\nPlease consider it!\n\nEDIT: Downloading the app will make things a lot easier!\n\nEDIT 2:\n\n**Groupme requires my phone number/name :(!**\n\nYes, it does. However, nobody can see your phone number except for you - groupme is actually technically a texting app and can be used via text without the app, that is why. Your name can be easily changed/hidden/whatever you like. However, it's worth noting that ANY inappropriate behavior WILL get you kicked (it has happened before) and there HAVE been irl meetups stemming from this chat. Nobody is out to stalk you! We're chill.

5	If you were not an ESFJ what would you be?	We all have certain ESFJ traits that are stronger then others? My closest flip is ENFJ and while I do identify with some aspects overall I see myself as an ESFJ.\n\nWhat about you guys?
4	For the longest time I thought I was an ENFJ, but I haven't been feeling like I've been 'measuring up'. I've since taken the test twice spaced apart by a few weeks and gotten ISFJ and ESFJ. I feel like these two better represent me. I also may have a form of multiple personality disorder, but that's a different discussion. 
2	I took two different versions of the test and one of them gave me ESFJ. The other was ENFJ. After some research I figured out that ENFJ was definitely it, but I can identify with a ton on this sub too. 
1	Quite possibly an ESFP or ENFP because these are my usual MBTI scores.
1	ESFJ 2's and manipulation	I have an ESFJ 2 mom and she's the most manipulative person. Is this combo particularly nasty or is it just my mom being a narcissist?
6	Narcissist.
3	Both. \n\nESFJ's build their own morals based on how they were raised (or raised themselves). So if they never talked out a thought process or misunderstanding, they might build up walls or rules around that wrong information. This can lead to them thinking they are being nice and helpful but they are really playing chess outloud, moving everyone the way they want and not what actually works for others.\n\nAdvice on taking to her, I would say be honest and straight forward. Don't bring feels bring facts and explain where she helps and where she doesn't as clearly as you can. \n\nHope this helps!

1	I had a boyfriend a few years ago who was really into it and he got me interested, though I haven't really paid much attention to it since we broke up a few years ago.  Anyway, I'm definitely a (phobic) 6. 
1	Checked it out a while back. I'm a 2w3.
1	Just took the test! I am a 9. Or a 9w1.\n\n
1	Another 6w7 here! However, I'll soon delve more deeply into the descriptions. Online tests aren't that reliable after all.
2	Social attitudes and Personality	Hi /r/esfj!\n\nI am a fourth year Psychology student currently studying in Melbourne Australia. My research thesis is focusing on the antecedents of social and political attitudes and their relations to personality, and here is the survey:\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Y7SJ5JC\n\nThere are some questions you may find interesting (I think...) and does not take too long. The survey is completely anonymous and has human ethics approval (info inside).\n\nIf you feel like giving it a go I would appreciate it. Feel free to share the link with anyone you think might enjoy it. \n\n\nThanks in advance\n
9	Question about how you see Fi users (INFPs and ISFPs)	Hi, I've been wanting to ask Fe users directly about how they see Fi at its extreme. \n\nAs a dom Fi user (INFP), I don't really take people seriously if they show a lot of outward emotion/facial expressions. They *seem* kind of fake, but that's just my instinctual reaction. I know that for Fe users, being very outwardly expressive and caring is the most genuine thing they can do. \n\nSo go ahead and tell me what your instinctual internal reaction is when around an INFP or ISFP being their normal self. Does it also seem not very genuine to you, or unnecessary? What is your mental process and internal feeling like around them?
2	I am not ESFJ but I think this is very interesting. Keeping my eyes out.
2	I am an ENFJ, so not exactly what you were looking for, but I did get 100% Fe user so there's that. \nMy SO is INFP. She and I are each other's support in everything, but there are times when I can see something is wrong, and I will ask, "What are you thinking?" or "Is something wrong?" And she says "I don't know." It happens a lot, and at first, when she and I were only friends, that she just kinda didn't want to tell me, so I let it alone, not wanting to pry. But I know now that she really just doesn't know how to express it. I will usually go with some open ended questions, like "Okay then, What are you feeling?" I have to kind of guide her through the expression. Once she gets started, then she becomes very articulate and really is able to vent. But it takes some help. So, no. I don't take it as ingenuine if someone can't express their feelings, or if they need to stew a bit first. I know it's an actual thing, that they may need some help, and that if they really want to express it, they will once they figure it out. 
3	ENTJ female - ESFJ male	Dear all\n\nHas anyone here tried a relationship with an ENTJ? I am an ENTJ female and yes, I am aware of the fact that personality types are only the basis and it all depends on the individuals. However, I'm also interested in the theoretical aspect of this.\n\nSo far (one month), I've recognized his emotional needs as an area of potential issues, since I cannot really accommodate them in his expected way - I'm not that warm and fuzzy, although most of the times I can read people's emotional needs.\n\nFurthermore, I'm pretty sure he isn't that straightforward with things that are annoying him. He is so accepting of my character, that it gets confusing to me (I still haven't delivered any serious criticism that might hurt his feelings though). Are ESFJs supposed to be like that or is this part of acting his best, since it's the beginning?\n\nI find positive that we are both interested in a long-term relationship and we are willing to put energy to make things work.\n\nThank you in advance for your feedback.
2	ESFJ MALE HERE:\n personally, when I'm in a relationship, I find my emotional needs are high. I don't like to speak up about it though, as it may hurt the other person. I would be aware of his state of mind, and try your best to accommodate. I also follow suit in that I will not often speak out about things that bother me. We tend to accept people for who they are rather quickly. When voicing your criticism, do it gently. I have a tendency to take it as an assault at first, but then think it over and realize it was not meant in that fashion. Just be up front and gentle. Now, these are just how I react, so take the advice at face value for your position. Best of luck, and I hope you both happiness and prosperity.
1	ESFJs will always, in almost a brainwashed way, love the character of the person they love - and love the things they love.  It's not fake, and it won't wear off in time - unless you hurt him a lot.  It's all part of the extreme affection and passion and desire to please and bond that ESFJs have.  :-)
1	i am INTJ\n\nand i personally at least think ESFJXINTJ are pairings with an incredibly low success rate. I don't know much about ENTJ though. its the way how ESFJ think about everything in relation on how it makes them feel. they cant put away their feelings when rationalizing. when you hear them talk and their ideas its always related to the person it affects. instead of the idea itself. and its like   they or i speak a totally different language.
3	ESFJs needed! Survey on sleeping patterns and personality.	edit: 9/30 ESFJs have taken this survey (about 1% of all participants). I need 21 more. Thanks!\n\nHello Everyone! I am undertaking a project to investigate the relationship between people's personalities and their sleep patterns. This survey will be posted in all MBTI related forums- if you could take it, I would greatly appreciate your time. It is pretty brief, and at the end there is the option to see the descriptive results (percentages of each response to see how you stack up to your fellow redditors). Once I have a sufficient number of participants, I will analyze the data to find correlations between different traits, and then post any interesting findings from the data. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lW19vAWhfaGu_MBDWkZl2KrJkTTGj3nXSvZJOTvEJhg/viewform If this goes well, this could be the first installation in an interesting social science series! Thanks!\n
4	Wedding plans and advice	I am an INTP marrying an ISTP in about a year.  We want our wedding reception to be simple and relaxed; if we had our way, we would have a barbeque with family and friends in casual dress and be happy.  Somewhere between our ideal and the constraints of tradition and formality is probably where we would end up.\n\nIf not for an ESFJ future mother in law trying to spend a ton of money on us and make everything formal and princessy and perfect.  She just does not get our attitude about this and doesn't believe us that we don't want flashy and expensive things.  She is taking all the control away from both us as a couple and my ESTJ mother (the latter is no easy feat).  We don't know how to approach her in a way that will convince her that we actually want something simple.  My fiance and her have a pretty poor relationship where non-shouting communication is rare.  My fiance is unconvinced that the best course of action is not to simply let MIL run the show and be miserable for a few ours at our hyper-formal reception.  Obviously I don't want that.  How do I deal with her and communicate our desire for a simple and practical wedding with minimal fluff and monetary cost?
3	If I was her, I'd want you to tell me. My feelings would be hurt in the moment, but I would get over it soon. I would be doing all of that just to make y'all happy and if it wasn't what y'all wanted then you would have to lay it out for me. 
1	Uninvite her until she learns that this is your wedding, and not hers.
1	I would be honest. Sit down with her, preferably alone if she doesn't get along with your fiance, and have a heart to heart. Tell her that you don't like it that she's not listening to your wants, especially since it's your wedding. Explain to her that different people want different things and you just happen to want something different than her. 
3	Is it common for ESFJ's to think they are introverts?	Hey guys, I am a pretty strong ISFJ. My brother and his wife are both ESFJ's, along with a friend of ours. All of them insist that they are introverts, but I don't think they are. My brother and sister-in-law have always been popular and outgoing people. Is it common for ESFJ's to be consider themselves introverts? Thank you!\n\nEdit: And I do realize that there are more to ESFJ's than the description I gave, but they match up with a lot of the other descriptions as well. They just don't consider themselves extroverts. 
2	A good question.  In my opinion, the Myers-Briggs personalities needs to be thought of as a grey area between the personality types; you're not just one or the other of the 4 areas.  Maybe your brother and wife are really good at acting like ESFJ's when they need to but it exhausts them?  I am an ESFJ sometimes, but sometimes I really need my alone time.\n\nI have heard that the main differentiation between an extrovert and an introvert is whether social interactions give you energy or drain your energy.  For me, sometimes it just varies.  I think that unless you are an extreme version of any of the personality types, you probably morph between them throughout the day.\n\nAgain, this is all my opinion based on how I am... maybe you should ask them about how social interactions affect them.  Do they always give them energy, drain energy, or just vary depending on their mood or situation?
2	i've found that many extroverts will claim to be introverts (especially ENFPs). i think there's a stereotype that extroverts are more superficial, also all people are in their heads to some degree, so i think people can interpret needing some alone time as full on introversion
2	I took the MBTI test and it said ESFJ. It was shocking because i always knew and felt like I was an introvert. Like being alone, hate social settings, prefer quiet and calm, etc. But at the same time, I do enjoy having a conversation with someone, as I have a lot to talk about and i love telling stories and whatnot. Just not with a group of people. I definitely prefer 1 on 1 convos than groups. For this reason. I consider myself as both. Im an ISFJ when im introverting and I become ESFJ when im feeling chatty. I believe everyone is a little bit of both (I v E, S v N, F v T, P v J) but we lean more towards one over the other. I think the "S" is what makes me feel like an introvert.
1	A esfj introvert, this make no sense imo. At least for what I am and for what rating I got from a nice looking website, which is, the result, esfj.\n\nMaybe someone that is going to be esfj in the future could be introvert right now.
1	Ok this thread is kind of old but it's on the front page. If you think you are ESFJ but feel like you are an introvert, it is possible that you are really an isfp. ISFP women can be popular and outgoing, they won't be super over the top with enthusiasm though. The men are more low key, but usually can always talk to a stranger. Both may consider themselves shy, confusing everyone around them who always see them interacting. \n\nESFJ have a kind of restless energy and will enjoy physical activities to relax themselves. ISFP will do everything they can to not physically exert themselves. 
3	ESFJ or ISFJ? Differences?	I (INTJ) have been dating an ESFJ.  Or I thought ESFJ.  He wasn't able to take a full MBTI, so I used the 16presonalities.com website test which I have found to be accurate for me.  ESFJ does make a lot of sense for his personality, and I think the majority of the description is spot on, but the big difference I am noticing is that he is not one to disclose personal information freely (something that is noted in the ESFJ profile prominently).  In fact, I often feel like I have to ask very specific questions or encourage him to share more.  He can be very reserved - not completely closed off...but I guess he gives the impression of being very private and cautious when it comes to sharing personal details and emotions.  This strikes me as more of an "I" trait, and the ISFJ profile seems to fit a lot of his habits as well.  \n\nAccording to the test results, he was about 35% on the E side.  I realize this is kind of a middle result, and that not everyone fits into just ONE category completely, but I would like to understand more about how the "I" or "E" preferences function in the ESFJ type.  My only thought/explanation so far has been that about 9 months ago a very serious long term relationship ended for him, and I know it has really been hard for him to move on and to deal with the hurt.  I guess I'm wondering if it's possible that his reservation has more to do with caution in relationships than it does with his personality type.\n\nMy question is, for any ESFJs, if you feel that your E preference is maybe not as pronounced, how does that change the way you view the typical descriptions of ESFJs?  What do you feel are the important differences between ESFJs and ISFJs?  And finally, is it possible that circumstances like a very difficult breakup can cause a little more introversion for an ESFJ who would normally be more open?\n\nAny and all input/comments are appreciated!
2	ENFJs dont like to disclose personal information. They will ask about other people but when you ask about them they close up.
1	as an ESFJ with a bit of painful relationship history, I can definitely attest to being less open than any normal person of my type in that regard. I've noticed that in my more depressed and lowly moods, I fall into a sulky introversion due to fear of embarrassment and shame from my actions or circumstance. Perhaps that's the case with your boo. Generally though, it still comes pretty natural just to let my mouth spew whatever information about myself seems relevant. On typing him, I find it much easier to type extroverts because their top function is usually so blatantly used. Chances are, if his Fe isn't full throttle, he's not an ESFJ. Still though, pronounced introversion in a type as people-dependent as ESFJs doesn't automatically mean he's an ISFJ. circumstance definitely matters.
3	An INTJ seeking advice	I am an INTJ with an ESFJ younger sister. I am the oldest (18) and she is 13. Recently our parents divorced and it has been pretty hard on her. Being an INTJ i'm not exactly as open with my emotions, and i guess you could say i have a smaller need to social interaction. I am trying to step up and help her as her older brother but i feel that the way i currently am don't really understand how she thinks or how she feels. I was wondering if any of you ESFJ's were in my sisters situation what would you want/ need in that situation.
3	Sorry about your parents. I'm sure this is tough for both of you. You sound like a great older brother.\n\nMy ex is an ISTJ, so slightly different from you, but what he never seemed to understand was that I didn't want rational explanations when bad things happened. I just wanted him to wrap me in his arms, tell me he loves me and that everything was gonna be ok. \n\nThat being said, your sister is at an age where something traumatic like this could really affect her for awhile. Counselling/therapy could help her work through her emotions.
1	I would say to ask about how she feels and just sit and listen to her talk. I really like to vent sometimes, especially in stressful situations. But if she doesn't take the bait and doesn't want to talk, then I'd just let her know that you're there to listen if she ever does want to talk. Even if she doesn't want to, it'll feel good to know she has your support.  
1	I'm an INTJ and my wife is an ESFJ. Based on our experience together, probably the best you can do is focus on spending social time together. Take her out to dinner, give her a ride to her friend's house, etc. -- and be on guard for her falling-in with the wrong crowd.\n\nIf you have any more specific questions, I'll do my best to help.
3	I need more ESFJ for my next Watson analysis!	I'm in the process of developing a more advanced analysis than [the one I provided](http://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/2r2uix/an_analysis_of_the_myersbrigg_subreddit_comments/). It will be based on people global reddit activity and take into account their type. \n\nIf you posted in /r/MBTI and your flair is set, I already got you in my database. Otherwise, please set your flair and post here. My script will find you that way. As a bonus, I will provide everyone that made it into my database their own graph comparing them to other redditors of their type.
1	I set my flair on /r/mbti.  I'm curious to see the results.  Thanks!
5	ESFJ with no clue which career to persue (from online marketing to management program organizer to...?) - HELP!	Hi, i am an ESFJ/ESFP (i took the test 2 times and am on the border between J and P), currently working as an organizer of executive education programs for a management school. I like the not-too-stressy aspect of the job, but on the other hand the job content is boring and not challenging at all. I have a master in International Business and one in Business Communication. My first job was as an online Marketing campaign manager for a major online player. the company was very chaotic and i did not feel professionally guided so i decided to leave, but now i am even more bored and feel undervalued at work. \n\nmy question is: what kind of careers do you think i could pursue with my education (+ the fact that i speak 5 languages of which 3 fluently)? \n\nTL;DR: ESFJ/ESFP with masters in Int. Business and Communications asking for career suggestions.
1	First you need to figure out if you are ESFP or ESFJ because they are completely different and thus have different career needs.
1	I'd go with anything that make you manage a lot of people. 
1	Hello. I am both as well and it is so confusing for me! In my previous job and I experienced some of what you talk about. I think the key point is that you are feeling undervalued this is a vital part of the ESFJ. The ESFJ hates routine but the ESFP prefers it,It's difficult being both as it often contradicts itself. I am currently trying to decide what to do as one is very creative and the other is more plan ahead type, quite different. I am an occupational therapist which is covered in both types but think I will pursue my ESFP/creative side. It depends what energises you at this time in your life. 
2	Change in type? ENFJ to ESFJ	So about a year ago I tested ENFJ, was pretty sure I fit every criteria of the type. Lived it and understood it.\n\nBut now after my serious breakup, my thoughts have shifted a little, and I recently retook the test feeling off. I tested as an ESFJ with only 1% judgement over perceiving.\n\nAnyone else had this happen to them? \n\nNot sure how to deal with it, I feel like I'm back at square one trying to understand myself. Just want to understand how these types differ and what has changed.
3	I'm an ESFJ who has frequently tested as ENFJ. I think the reason is I have pretty well-developed Ne and all of those tests look at individual letters rather than functions. Anyway, I have a good friend who's an ENFJ and I've noticed some big differences between her and me. She's always looking at whether everything she's doing fits into her life goals. This is a big Ni trait that I notice in my INTJ dad as well. Everything she does she does for a reason and that's to get herself closer to where she sees herself in 10, 20, or 50 years even. Her goals are often very spiritual/psychological in nature, like achieving self-actualization, but they are super important to her. I don't really have many goals for myself besides being happy. I mean, I have dreams that I hope to achieve some day but I don't think about them constantly and I live much more moment-to-moment than her. She also has her head in the clouds more often, while I'm more practical and down-to-earth. She's a believer while I'm a skeptic. 
2	Of all the types, I think ESFJ and ENFJ seem to have the most in common between types, though they're still majorly different. I wouldn't think much should change for you. ENFJs want to take care of people from a long range standpoint and ESFJs want to do the same but practically; day-to-day.
1	These are the two types I always test as, so I think it's reasonable to see in other ESFJs. I see them as very similar types. ESFJs are people focused, outspoken, and very in the moment. ENFJs are also people focused, but more restrained with their own thought sharing and are looking at the bigger picture. \n\nEdit: [Here](http://www.preludecharacteranalysis.com/types/enfj/vs/esfj) is a nice side by side comparison.
0	Looking for ESFJ to chat with on IRC.	I just though about that. Maybe it could be nice to chat with some ESFJ. If some people is interested I could start a room on a server.\nBtw, don't count of me to preserve our privacy. \n\nEdit: I'm a ESFJ.
1	Haev you ever even seen ESFJ? That most people to come about when the interest rises but more like how they preserve prvacy
4	Facebook and lots of friends?	My little sister tested as an ESFJ, however she doesn't have a facebook, is super shy (at least around me), and keeps only a tight group of friends. She also graduated top of her class in highschool and in my opinion makes silly social mistakes: clingy with asshole boyfriend, casually lies, hangs out with dudes her own age that are sort of losers. She's super bright, and strikes me as introverted.\n\nShe's just a teenager, is this common behavior with ESFJs? 
5	Sounds like an unhealthy ESFJ
2	Most people think I'm introverted until they get to know me. I'm pretty shy, especially when I was a teenager. Honestly I think she sounds a lot like a teenager ESFJ. 
1	It's important here, she's young... She's being tested for her potential?\n\nBtw, I think you don't really know what is ESFJ? 
2	What ESFJs think of INTJs?	An ESFJ already said to me that i am the only person capable of making her (esfj) nervous and stressed.
3	I have INTJ friends, programmer types and whatnot. They are definitely on a whole different wavelength with some things but I adjust to it and don't get offended. The thing that throws me off sometimes is when sharing a story or feeling and getting "okay" as a reply, I'm a conversationalist looking for conversation.
1	Interesting. My S/O is an INTJ (borderline E/I) and I think that we fall into the "complementary" idea. I think she's fantastic and we get along super well 99% of the time, but we definitely differ in terms of spontaneity especially, and that can be frustrating on both ends. 
1	My sister is also ESFJ and is married to an INTJ. Super healthy relationship too. 
1	I'm a female ESFJ dating a male INTJ and I agree with what you said up there. Definitely at first, he was basically the only one to make me feel nervous. I just never knew what he was thinking, because he was always so quiet and contemplative, I was worried he was judging me all of the time. Not negatively, but taking in what I did. Eventually I realized that he wasn't even thinking about me at all. He was just quiet. Not always even thinking of anything. Now I feel a lot more relaxed around him. I know he's not going to judge me for anything. He just going to let me do my thing and enjoy what I do because he cares about me.
3	Caught my FN kick in tonight.	I was at the hookah bar relaxing and getting into a good state of mind, and everything was going great! Up until I decide to leave for the night. Walk outside and realize my truck is gone. Call the police and find out it has been towed. This set off my FE response in a bad way. I became very angry very quick. But the good news is, I realized what had happened and was actually able to calm myself down. So all in all, it was good experience to help me further control my reaction to plans not going to plan.\n\n\nTl;dr - truck got towed, got very upset, but was able to see it and calm myself back down.
1	FN?
1	Sorry... FE function
4	Need help from ESFJ	I'll be blunt. I'm a male INTJ and I'm trying to save my marriage. I've read a couple of books on relationships and I have an exponentially better idea about how to communicate effectively with my ESFJ wife. All I have to do to save our marriage is prove to her that I love her. Very simple in concept, frustrating because I've loved her the entire time and she hadn't felt it. Reading the books really helped me to understand better how she needs to feel loved by me.\n\nThe problem is that she doesn't make any time for me and even actively avoids me when she would otherwise have time by immediately filling it with basically anything else. She had admitted to putting up an emotional wall of sorts. I'm not exaggerating when I say some days we don't see eachother at all, purely because of our work shifts, unless I want to stay up late to do so. Which I have done, and she responds with typically a very short conversation and goes to bed. In her defense she is legitimately tired, and frankly by then so am I.\n\nSo what I'm asking for is some ideas that would help me to connect with her better in what short time we may have throughout the day until she feels confident and more comfortable to spend more time with me so we can fix it much better. The work I've been putting into the relationship appears to be working, but it's very slow going and I want to make the absolute most of the time we have together when we do have the time.\n\nFor those who are curious, here's the books I read:\n\n* [Real Love in Marriage](http://www.amazon.com/Real-Love-Marriage-Finding-Happiness/dp/1592403107/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1412637211&sr=8-1)\n* [5 Love Languages](http://www.amazon.com/The-Love-Languages-Secret-Lasts/dp/0802473156/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1412638488&sr=8-1)\n\nThe first one I think was more important for me even as a person to understand. I actually found it so helpful with life advice in general that I recommended it so a couple single friends, one with depression issues even and it helped him a lot. The second feels like it helped me to understand how to better focus my efforts.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice offered!
3	My husband is ESFJ and I am an INTJ  female. I might be able to help. \n\nPm me 
3	[deleted]
2	ESFJ Male here. I might be able to shed some light on things, Pm me. 
1	First, some disclaimers - i am INTP myself, and i am a student of [socionics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socionics). It's basically an eastern-european version of MBTI with a bit more emphasis on intertype relations.\n\nIf both of your types have been determined correctly, then the problem likely is that INTJ and ESFJ are conflicting types. Reason for this is that main products of INTJ psyche are Ni(introverted intuition) and Te(extroverted thinking) functions, both of which ESFJ is vulnerable to. This works both ways - Fe(extroverted feeling) and Si(introverted sensing) of ESFJ are the weaknesses of INTJ. This leaves both mentally drained in prolonged contact with each other. The result is escalating conflicts arising from seemingly trivial things and frequent inability to come to understanding between the two.\n\nTo make this relationship last would require either both partners act like someone they're not (INTJ acting as INTP and ESFJ acting as ESFP, for example), which is not conductive to their mental health, or keeping their distance, which in turn is not conductive to a marriage.\n\nI am sorry to rain on already sombre topic, and i do hope i am wrong, but if this rings true, then maybe it is worth some heartache to avoid a lifetime of misery.
6	Observations of an INTJ/M, recently married to an ESFJ/F	Hi all, INTJ male in peace here! I married my girlfriend of just under 5 years last month, and out of curiosity persuaded her to do an MBTI test, having found I learnt a lot more about myself and how my personality comes across to everyone else by doing so. Having found out how diametrically opposed our respective personality types are and that these relationships rarely work, I was very surprised!\n\n\nDespite our often vast differences in personality (as can be explained by our MB personality types), we do have some great times together and are very much in love with one another, but finding out she was an ESFJ and doing a bit of reading has really helped me understand her motivation and character, and why the disagreements we have between us can sometimes happen.\n\n\nFairly characteristically of an INTJ, I'm very analytical and sometimes honest and critical to the point of perceived bluntness by others, a fairly unpleasant INTJ flaw I am keenly aware of and trying to temper at every occasion. Of course, this "cold and calculating" outward impression paired with an ESFJ tendency (I hope I word this correctly!) to be very open, deeply empathic and in tune with the well being of their loved ones, and to be hurt by indifference or perceived criticism from those they care about, is a clear problem area. It's something that personally, I find myself thinking afterwards, damn, am I really being such an arsehole to my wife, of all people? What at the time I see as being just my honest interpretation of something, in a purely scientific, emotionally indifferent way, will be perceived by my wife as more critical, or worse still, unloving. It's a flaw of mine for sure, but one heightened by our differences too!\n\n\nShe also frequently talks of the need for respect in a relationship, which I totally agree with in my own analytical INTJ way, however, understanding now that this includes what she feels is very important, real support and approval from her loved ones and a dislike for disharmony or conflict, is much easier for me to understand now. Apologies if this sounds at all condescending - this is how I understand it, but some (probably far better) insight from you guys would be really appreciated too.\n\n\nIn my own slightly selfish way, I hope that my wife will come to understand my obvious flaws better with the knowledge of my personality type. I'm sure you have heard the same from INTJs on here before, but there is a warm person to be found under the outwardly mechanical personality. When we upset our loved ones because we come across as heartless or emotionally indifferent, it does make us (or at least me) feel thoroughly crappy aftwerwards. I of course find it hard to articulate my emotions and passions well, but my wife, as an ESFJ, is a truly warm, caring person who has drawn the very best out of me emotionally since we've been together. Being an "E" to my "I" means, as a couple, we have some great friendships, and she is always suggesting new things, places to go and people to see which I would probably have never done myself. \n\n\nI'm obviously trying to improve myself, and being more understanding of her desire for emotional support from me, while maybe not being my strength, is something I am working on. Part of me wonders if there is any plasticity in our personality types, and that I can get more in touch with my "S" and "F" side.\n\n\nI hope that all comes across well enough, and sorry for the wall of text. I'd love to read something from anyone with experience or insight into this sort of relationship, or if any of you could perhaps explain what drives an ESFJ better than my current understanding, my wife will thank you! =)
2	My experience is the total oposite to the point of not wanting anything with any esfj. Besides just being an acuaintance
2	Can't say I've seen an intj/esfj pairing, but then you intj's are pretty rare. That being said, it sounds like you're doing great in trying to work on communication and understanding. The fact that you're still pursuing this kind of thing after five years together really says a lot. :)\n\nThe MBTI is great for understanding how another person works. And the "pairings" you read about are broad stroke generalities that don't mean anything when you get down to your own personal relationship. If you love your ESFJ - that's what matters. Isabel Myers didn't marry her "best match" and she'd tell you not to worry about it, but to use what you know to help make your marriage better (which you're doing - bravo).\n\nI like to think that marrying someone with a lot of opposing "preferences" can help to even you out and force you to appreciate qualities in others you may be more apt to dismiss if you only associate with people that think like you. My two cents. :)
2	I applaud your efforts as I am with an ESFJ as well.  I am an learning about Jungian typology has really helped me understand our relationship dynamic.  I remember having bad arguments where I would be sitting there asking myself, "What the f*ck?", is this for real?   There are unresolved conflicts between my critical approach to belief systems and her desire for traditional and provisional support.  \n\nAnother point of contention is her Fe emotional approach and my Ne Ti quest for knowledge and truth.  For instance, if I am busy researching something particularly interesting, I may lose track of time and be unreachable or irritated if when interrupted.  I am trying to download information into my brain to be analyzed.  I am intensely fascinated by possibilities.  She expresses extreme anger when she feels "unloved" or ignored.  She finds this introverted, seemingly, detached state foreign and takes it as a sign that I don't care about her or have fallen out of love with her.  She also pushes emotions outwards (which I feel attacked by) and tries to rationalize her feelings rather than understand them.  \n\nI am often repulsed by her behavior and emotional outbursts even though I understand her deeply emotional nature.  I am trying to  meet her half way and console her emotionally but sometimes there is a major disconnect.  I try to use logic to communicate but it often makes the situation worse because she doesn't process information very well.  \n\nI've been working on ways of recognizing emotions and displaying comforting emotions.  I've found it helps to discover the emotions she's feeling and apply the correct emotional antidote.  This may sound a bit manipulative but i haven't yet found a way to communicate with her beyond that.  \n\nOn the bright side, understanding her type has had great benefit.  I am more able to notice, evaluate, and value her strengths.  Thus, I am more empathetic to her perspective.  She's incredibly loyal, persevering and dutiful. I truly respect those qualities and her caring sensibility.  She's also really cute :)
2	I'm an INFJ Male, know an ESFJ Female for potential?	So I'm trying to figure out this ESFJ (according to her) but I'm having a difficult time.  I don't know if it's because I'm an INFJ or I'm just really bad at talking to her.  I want to get to know her but when we're together, I'm always worried that we won't have anything to talk about (when we are hanging out with our mutual friends, she tends to stay quiet and so do I).  Anyone have any suggestions or tips on if it's just me or what?  I think she might be interested in me but I don't know how to tell.  
2	Man up 
1	Ask her out for beverages-of-choice and see what there is to talk about, get to know her, let her get to know you, and see what's up.  I don't think it matters what type you are.  
5	Where do ESFJ's hang out?	I want to make an ESFJ friend because I think this type is the one that is most compatible with my type. Could you tell me what places you guys go to hang out when you go out? What places during the day and at night?
10	Everywhere that there are other people. Not. Even. Kidding.\n\nIt's Sunday and I'm feeling antsy because I've had no interaction yet. What to do? GO SOMEWHERE WHERE I AM WITHIN 10 FEET OF ANY OTHER HUMAN.\n\nMy actual feelings.
2	Luncheons, dinner parties, church...
1	I'm actually a bit of a homebody, but when I'm not at home I'm shopping (I love bookstores), at restaurants or cafes with a close friend, at the movies or seeing a play.
1	I live with a large group of roommates but sometimes they aren't even enough. I shop, got to shows, walk around the park. 
1	With ppl but it's private place in my case. And it would be... I mean I'd do that if I could.
1	When I have free time I love this local little tea shop nearby. I can go and read, or maybe write a little bit here and there. I don't go out of my way to seek out others but I appreciate the presence of a crowd. Going to bookstores is my next favorite place. 
1	Hookah bars are home to me. Music in the background, friends around me. I get very antsy at home alone.
5	INTP looking for advice on how to deal with controlling ExFJ stepfather. Thought you'd be the people to ask.	I've tried really hard to make our relationship work (and sometimes it does) but whenever we disagree, it ends badly. Before I knew about mbti I tried to explain things as clearly and concisely as I could - using logic (which is really the only way I know how to go about this) but I (predictably) was never able to get through to him. I really could use some help.
5	ExFJs usually put less value on logical arguments than they do on emotional ones. I know it's the opposite of how you approach arguments, but the best way to persuade him is to bring up how things make you feel. Instead of "eat this apple because it's healthier for you than that slice of cake", a better way to persuade an ExFJ is to say "eat this apple because I went out and got it for you and it would make me happy if you did".
3	The thing that ExFJs have in common is that they use Fe first (your last or 4th function) so they are going to care about the happiness of the group before anything.  By you explaining things as logically as possible, they are reacting the way you would if someone tried to use an emotional response to change your mind.  Try talking like this as much as you hate it and it makes you want to pull your teeth out: "when you speak this way, it makes me feel like you're not listening to me."  "It's hurtful when you _______".  "It seems like we are butting heads really hard and that's not good for anyone, what do you think we can do to get along better?".   Especially if he's an ESFJ, you can appeal to the idea of being a great family. But either way focus on the way that you feel and how situation causing the problem affects the ability for everyone to get along. But use the words "We" and "feel" more than phrases like "It would make much better sense if....".\n\n Check out /r/esfj and /r/enfj and look at how they word their thoughts and then try to mimic that.  If all else fails, just work on choosing your battles and limiting your time spent (what I do with my ESFJ mom).\n\nThe easiest way for me to identify the difference (whether Si or Ni is their 2nd function) is to ask: is the person really sentimental and into tradition or are they comfortable with change? From my ESFJs are generally more hyper and traditional, while ENFJs are more creative and sometimes like to perform. \n\nEdit:  Check out [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ESFJ/comments/270qhk/upsidedown_esfj_trying_to_understand_esfjs/chxgh6e  )from r/esfj.  Also I just remembered that ExFJs want nothingmore in the world to be appreciated.  So if you are going to have a conversation, start with telling him the things you appreciate about him i.e. how he's been nice to your mom or something, even if you have to stretch the truth.  
3	Please help! I need responses for a survey about MB type and handedness! Thanks!	
2	done!
7	Upside-down ESFJ trying to understand ESFJs	I'm an INTP, with the same functions but in the opposite order. I know one person who is definitely an ESFJ, and sometimes our perspectives just seem incomprehensibly alien to each other. Frequently, she's made me wonder "What? Why?!" and she seems to think I'm weird and/or nuts. Not to mention completely different priorities and interpretations of things (we went to high school together. I explained a lot of logical/conceptual nuances to her in english class when she had trouble. And she's explained some things to me as well)\n\nBasically, I'm hoping someone here could explain your perspective in terms of the cognitive functions.

3	How do estj's act when they have feeling for a person?	I can't believe that I have stooped as low as to asking this on reddit, but I am an intp, and I really like an esfj girl. I ask her to do things like get coffee or things I think would be fun, and we do them together and it's quite wonderful.  Neither of us will take a step, or show whether or not we think of one another as more than friends, and my inability to act on anything other than certainty with important decisions is crippling me since I actually really enjoy being friends with her.  Are there super small hints that I could pick up on to help me know what the hell is going on in her head?\n\nEdit: sorry for the title, Esfj is what I meant to say. 
2	I would say perhaps just being more open with her. Telling her things that are more important to you, and pulling yourself out of your shell a little more will help. It's hard to get a read on someone who is guarded, and a lot of introverts seem guarded to extroverts, even if you don't mean to be. \n\nLetting her know that the things you talk about are important and something you don't often share might be a good first step to see if she is interested. I date mostly introverts, so when they really open up, it helps me see that I more than their one "extrovert" friend who they use to go out when they need to. \n\nMy boyfriend is an INTJ, and it took months of talking and sharing before I really became interested because for so long our friendship was mostly based around when he felt the need to be sociable. Maybe ESFJ's are a little dense when it comes to these things, and if it's not out in the plain, we just assume you are being nice. 
1	I am personally someone bad at making a first move. That said if she is accepting all your offers to go out on date like activities I say just go for it and make that first move! 
2	Anyone else in a relationship with an INTJ?	I'm not really sure if I took the test correctly, but I came out an ESFJ and my partner for over 2 years is an INTJ, I gather from our roommate and this subreddit that this is kind of a weird match. Is anyone else in a relationship with an INTJ? How is/was it?\n\nEdit: Grammar and stuffs\n\nEdit 2: We had been together for over two years before we took the test, so it isn't a big deal. We have a roommate who is an ENTJ and they get along very well, so I guess I'm the only one that has feelings lol and the only bubbly person here :P Anyways, it just explains a lot of stuff, like I always want to do something or party and he always wants to stay at home, and it explains some of our problems. It's just a different perspective I guess :)
5	As an INTJ, I dated an ESFJ once. I was miserable, more miserable than perhaps any other time in my life.
3	It's tricky to manage at times. I've dated a few and they drove me the most crazy I've ever been. 
3	My boyfriend is a INTJ but it works. He enjoys spending time at home but knows I need time to be out and about. It doesn't bother him that I go out without him, or even not invite him. \n\nWhat I do need, is someone who will make me come home at a reasonable hour and be a little bit more grounded since I'll make myself sick being out too much.\n\nOn the other hand, he needs someone to pull him out of the house so he doesn't get depressed. It works well both ways. We also live with a bunch of roommates, so both of our needs are easily filled. I can hang out with my roomies, while he hides in our room for "alone time".\n\nHe will go out with me sometimes, but I like going alone or with friends instead. Not that I don't love my SO, but I worry too much about him when he's out with me. Besides, I love coming home to him all warm in bed after a long night.
5	I've just come out of one with a INTJ.\n\nDifficult, it was like a rollercoaster. By the end of it I realised I was walking on eggshells, but felt like she possessed me. It really wasn't a great feeling. She was very Introverted and critical of alot of what I did, and I took it personally while she;d say I should be 'more emotionally mature' and to just get over it. End of the day, I (unfortunately) look back on it and see her as a bit of a self-absorbed bitch....\n\n\nBut that's my experiences haha
2	[deleted]
2	My mom is an ESFJ and my dad is an INTJ. It's very much an opposites-attract kind of relationship. My mom is very social, while my dad loves to hole himself up in the study.
1	I can't speak to the INTJ-ESFJ relationship directly, but most of my close/intense friendships throughout life have been with INTJs.\n\nHonestly, I have very little relationship/friendship experience with ESFJs. One of my close friends of 15 years is an ESFJ...but that is the only one.\n\nDo you have any specific questions or scenarios you want to talk over?
1	[deleted]
1	my mother is ESFJ. i love her like a mother, but god dam i hate her so much i feel miserable around her. so much i already banned possible ESFJ partners from my life. im just subbed here to learn how to deal with you people.
6	I want to bring life (and people) here !	What you ,ESFJs think about bringing some INTPs (Like me) and INTJs here ?\n\nIt would bring some nice activity here. I've seen some of you were a bit sad that this subreddit weren't as lively as you wanted to.\n\nSo I had this idea.\n\nI wanted to know how you felt about this before making it real.\n\nIf I have dozen of you who are okay ,I'll put a post on /r/INTP and /r/intj and bring some people here ! \^^\n\n***\n\nPlus I love chat a bit with you guys ,so if you have anything to say please tell I would be happy to answer or discuss !\n\n***\n**Agreements countdown** : +3 (3|0) ,7 more to go !\n***\nHave a nice day ! ~~\n\nThanks for your attention !\n\n***\n\n**EDIT** (April, 19^(th)) : \n\nI keep an eye on this thread ,so don't be shy ! \^^    \nI'll count aggrements by PMs too !

2	Yes :)
2	I would think that is nice. Though I wouldn't be surprised if there aren't a lot of ESFJ's on here because they are too busy hanging out with other people. HAHA. 
1	I would support this!

1	Am I a bit late to the party on this one? I'm an INTJ with an ESFJ wife, would really like to get involved in some discussion on here.
4	ENFP trying to understand an ESFJ friend.	A little backstory to this friendship (this is going to be complicated). About 9 months ago in May 2013, this friend of mine, lets call her K, reached out to me and wanted to talk to me. She was going through a really tough relationship where her ex basically didn't care for her at all but she was having trouble trying to break off. She felt terrible so she kind of turned to me and talked to me. And well, over the next few months we started texting each other much much more, almost on a daily basis. We went out a couple of times for dinner and saw each other occasionally in university. Fast-forward to August, I was suspecting she was trying to get close to me and I was already starting to really like her since we hit it off really well. Then all of a sudden she became a little distant and cold. So feeling really uncomfortable, I eventually confessed to her that I liked her (she was still attached). She thanked me for my honesty and told me that she did indeed consider me as a bf, but she was still hoping for her best for her relationship. Surprisingly, things weren't awkward at all between us even after that confession, in fact we got closer afterwards.\n\nSo things progressed and this time round we gradually got closer, met up more, and she felt even more strongly then that I could be a good bf to her. There were a couple of bumps along the way, whenever I made a mistake that she couldn't sit well with, she would essentially ignore me and refuse to talk to me for extended periods of time (1 to 2 weeks). That made me very distressed as I needed the interaction and that I was getting comfortable with her.\n\nShe eventually broke up at the end of November, nearly 4 months ago. So yes, we grew even closer again, with her sharing how she felt and wondering why she did not meet me earlier. At that time she was basically behaving wildly and just wanted to #YOLO and go crazy. Eventually she calmed down and sometime in late January she told me that she was basically in love with me. In effect we were unofficially together, but she was holding back because she wasn't sure if I was going to be that life partner that she really wanted. In late February she told me that it would be better for us if we stayed a little further apart. I was pretty devastated at that time but I agreed to it. But with the exception of calling each other every night, we still talked on a daily basis and were very comfortable with each others' presence in our lives, that we would turn on Skype and leave it on while doing our own work. (Yes I'm 25, she's 22, we live in Singapore and the apartments here are at least half a million USD. It's normal in our culture to live with our family until we're married.)\n\nRecently 2 weeks ago, she suddenly gave me a very cold shoulder, stopped talking for several days. I asked her if everything was okay, she replied yeah. So I voiced my concerns but she saw that as me being oversensitive and kicking up a fuss just because we couldn't talk. In the few days following after that, having been ignored for over a week, and finding out a little more from a friend. She said she had decided that we should just be friends and basically stop anything intimate or close (which we've been since 9 months ago). Naturally this made me feel really heartbroken inside, it was kind of like a relationship already, why the sudden change? Things became quite bad and awkward, she wouldn't reveal anything about her daily life, just necessary work discussion, we were becoming hi and bye friends, even worse than when we started.\n\nI decided to find out more from her best friend (INTJ). According to her, K has been thinking really hard about her prospects with me and she couldn't bring herself to love me enough. I highlighted the time period when she actually liked me, but then it felt like an infatuation period all of a sudden. Am I right to say that? Her best friend also told me that all of a sudden, everything that I did to her, or did in general, that was once really charming, became irritating. That she probably realised that me and K had some serious incompatibilities, even as friends. This sudden 180 degree turn just blew my mind, I couldn't wrap my head around it. Her best friend did try to defend me by saying that she was being unnecessary biased, and that K's actions for hardening her heart were because God told her and gave her the will to do (yes she's Christian but let's not go any further into it if you aren't a believer). Perhaps she was trying to justify all her actions by using God as a reason. And to add on, this sudden change coincided with her changing her lifestyle drastically, she suddenly woke up much earlier to do her work (we're in crunch time now trying to complete a major project), and stress levels are peaking for everyone. She also decided to #YOLO a little more and started hanging out with other people and message others, instead of me, which made me really jealous.\n\nYesterday she was really mean to me in front of everyone, refusing to help me and clearly putting distance between me and her, although she realised later that it was really bad and she apologised and tried to be friendlier to me. She's still really cold towards me.\n\nWe have decided to actually talk it out, with her best friend around (she knows everything) some time after our major project is done, which is in about a week's time. And I really want to get prepared and not get hurt. None of us is able to understand what K is thinking right now, our mutual friends (INFJ), her best friend (INTJ) were all just confused with her actions and behaviour and just wondering what she could be thinking, especially with respect to that 180 degree change.\n\nI do know ESFJs are people who feel really bad about hurting others, but this time round it all just seems really paradoxical and it doesn't align with her character at all. After all this came from a girl who considered other guys and still found me to be the best, and yet suddenly started this "ignore me" thing only 2 weeks after that comment.\n\nShe seems to be running away from her problems and covering it up with a veil, of course hurting me and leaving all her friends really confused as to what is going on. Really, I've been the consistent one throughout the entire time, and her whims and temperaments have been swinging wildly. Maybe I should have taken control of the situation more (I let her control most of the things as I felt she was the one that needed the recovery). But right now the most important thing is trying to figure out what in the world is going through in her head so I can prepare to talk to her, and to protect myself from any further heartbreak.\n\n

1	go wit the INFJ or INTJ lol (ENFP)
1	I don't have any immediate advice, but all I have to say is to make sure you don't become the (no offense) 'bitch' boy. Know that while you do care for her, there should be a certain point when you distance yourself from her if she keeps putting you on a rollercoaster. You HAVE to make sure you're being cared for too.
9	I'm INTP in research about ESFJs !	I want to know people behind the letters.\n\nThe best way I know is to chat with you\n\nSo let's chat ! =D\n\n---\n\nI use to be patient an determinated when I have somthing in mind ,So even if the little number in upper left corner become big ,feel free to post anything and I'll answer asap (less than a day usually ,ever less than a week.) .
3	[deleted]
2	Still have questions?\nWhat are your perceptions of ESFJ'S? \n
1	Do you have any more questions? Or did /u/SavvySmuel take care of them?\n
4	ENTP could use ESFJ sex/relationship advice	I'm an ENTP married to an ESFJ. \n\nI do genuinely love her to pieces. We had a blow-up fight last night and I slept on the sofa. The fight was about sex. We've been having sex less and less lately because I haven't been initiating. When she initiates, she gets upset because she says that I'm making her feel unwanted and a girl shouldn't have to do that.\n\nI agree with her, but the problem with our sex life is that I've been feeling stifled. We used to be fairly sexually open and willing to explore new things. Over the years, she complains about this or that sex act and it has gotten to the point where I don't ask her to do anything other than vanilla sex because I feel guilty about it. She won't ask me to do anything other than vanilla sex (occasionally finger her) because she wants to be considerate of me. The thing is, I *want* to do other things to her that she likes, and I keep telling her that.\n\nA good example was at my last birthday. There's a certain sex act that I really enjoy and she doesn't, but she will do it for me to make me happy. After not doing that for a while, I asked her for it on my birthday. She got upset -- not because I asked to do it, but because I asked to do it *before* the dinner date she had planned and not after it, which is what she had originally planned to do. As a result, my sexy birthday present was ruined because she complained about it.\n\nThe result of this is that I feel like I've been trained to just do vanilla sex. When I ask for something, she complains. When I don't ask, she makes no effort to think outside of the box sexually. And since I love her, I feel guilty asking her to do things that I know she doesn't love.\n\nI talked to her about this last night and she blew up because I didn't talk to her about this earlier, which means that she's felt unwanted for longer than was necessary. I admit that I should have talked to her about this earlier, but once again I feel like I'm trained not to criticize her because she *explodes* whenever I offer her any criticism whatsoever. The second I even suggest that she did something wrong I usually hear lines like, "Oh, so it's all *my* fault?" After that, I have to switch to damage control mode because she leaps to the worst case scenario and starts talking about divorce and a miserable future together. She cranks it up to 10 at the drop of a hat.\n\nThings haven't been doing great recently between us and I'm trying to improve things. That's mostly my fault. I haven't been a great husband but I feel like I make a lot of progress towards improving the relationship. Inevitably, something upsets her and she says another one of her favorite lines, "You took 1 step forward and 99 steps backward." \n\nI'm just feeling exasperated. I've been trying to be more kind and considerate, and offer things in the relationship that she needs. The first time the slightest thing goes wrong, I have to go back to tripping over myself doing nice things for her while she coldly keeps me "on trial" so to speak. \n\nI know I should take the blame here, too. I can be cold, distant, and I can bottle up my feelings, which leads to a lot of our problems. I just don't know what to do because I can't get her to accept responsibility for her half of the equation without setting off a volcano. \n\nI'm not sure what I'm asking for you guys. I'm just trying to vent, I guess. If you have any insight, I do genuinely want to improve my relationship. I love her, and I'm sick to death of these "resets." Fixing a rocky relationship will always have setbacks, but I feel like I can't get anywhere if every speedbump is a "Return to go, do not collect $200" event.
2	As an Esfj myself I find myself feeling somewhat similar with my own relationships. I can't offer much help or even a solution but I often find that I am terrible at conveying my thoughts or trying to explain my emotions. Sometimes I don't even know why I'm angry until AFTER I sit and think to myself for a while. Most of the time I get angry about a lot of little things. \nThe point is, *communication*, Esfj suck at it and you'll need to be better at talking about what you're feeling/what your partner is feeling for life to be peaceful.  My partner has a few of the same problems with me and it all could have been avoided if we just talked about it. Keep in mind that as an ESFJ it is very hard not to feel like you are "under attack" when criticized. It may not be the right thing but we can't help it ^_^" good luck man!
2	I would say that it is just really important when you confront her that you make sure you are coming from a place of love. The best thing someone can do in these situations is to be extremely reassuring. 
1	I'm not following after the birthday scenario. You asked for something, she got upset because of when you asked and not what you asked (as it was already her plan), and then you say it was ruined because she complained?
5	Highly accurate description IMO	
1	What do you guys think?
14	ESFJ 2.0	Hello my fellow Wolfpack members, ever since I discovered that I was an ESFJ. I did some research and discovered something. We provide positive energy to the world despite that we are emotional. Why can't we encourage ourselves? Why don't we entertain ourselves when we feel alone? We should start posting our stories that may leave you confused. We need to provide the inspirational advices we give others. \n\nMembers welcome to ESFJ 2.0
6	I think it has something to do with the fact that our energy is triggered when we are around people. The very act of being near people makes us happy. When we are alone we get bored and lethargic. IMHO, We can't give ourselves comfort or entertainment because we need to be around people in the first place to have it.
3	I don't know, but it's something that i've found which greatly applies to me\n\npersonally I like helping people, and it can be really difficult to help myself sometimes. when I do try and fix my own problems, I create this situation where I think i'm special and my problems are much worse than others. so helping others is how I live vicariously, especially if they're my close friends. so in effect it kinda makes me feel better\n\nso yeah :/
3	"We should start posting stories that may leave you confused" \n\nI am already confused.
2	Typo. I meant that we shod learned and improve from each other. It's hard living as a male ESFJ
1	We can do these things for ourselves, and that's why I think these categories are transcendable.\n\nAs of right now, I am at the beginning stages of a relationship with someone who I think is an INTJ and have had a couple of occurences where I regretted expressing myself because it came out so messy. I was unable to control my passions, and though I thought I was expressing myself in a calm manner about my emotions but it still came off, I think, as selfish and worthy of contempt. Embarassing but I still have to fight off the nagging feeling that I should give in to resentment for them not giving me more to go on as far as intimacy is concerned. Alas, I just need more patience and self-control.
3	ESFJ on the dating side	Hello fellow members. I wonder how the wonderful world of dating is going? What are the key things to look for and avoid based on our personality? 
5	When I dated, I would get attached quickly.  I always wanted to make him happy however I could, even if that meant doing something I didn't really want to do.   My relationships seemed to get serious too quickly also.\n\nIt was very hard for me to break up with somebody because I hate hurting people, so I have been in some relationships longer than I want to admit.\n\nHappily married to an ISFJ now, and we complement each other pretty well.  He still doesn't understand why I like to reddit and look at my "weird stuff," yet he's the one who works with computers and technology!  \n\nI irk him sometimes when I want to invite the whole town over and he's just content with his 2-3 friends here.  
5	Well, I'm really good at getting too attached....don't do that haha
3	Been single for over a year and a half by my own choice. Needed to become a better man and moved to a new city out of state 
1	Same thing happens to me constantly. But the thing is that, I can't play the douche bag role unless I am really not interested. It's hard for me to lie to myself haha
1	How about try INTPs like (m)e ? =D
0	I know this is an old post, but I've been in a relationship for over 2 years now with an INTJ. Our relationship has been great, we've had some ups and downs like normal couples, but even in our low points I couldn't stand the thought of breaking up. We are just really good with our communication skills :D
10	Hello fellow ESFJ's!	Just poppin' by to say hello!  This subreddit is pretty dead. any ideas on how we can get it alive?  Saw a comment on an earlier thread saying, we're not here, because we're out and about not on reddit, which is probably true.  If you compare, we have 108 people here, where some of the other Myers-Briggs subreddits have thousands of subscribers.  \n\nOh well, that doesn't have to stop us from having a great subreddit.\n\nSo anyway, how's everyones days going?  Do any of you know any esfj's in real life?  Do your personalities ever clash?  Do you finish each other's sentences?  I don't know any ESFJ's (or at least, I don't think I do), so I'm curious how your relationship is with another ESFJ.\n\nThere's really no point to this post, just wanting to say hi, and see if there's anyway we can get this subreddit more active.
3	SUP!\nI dunno man, I'm an ESFJ but i work a boring-ass job where I don't have much to do besides reddit. (as an ESFJ it makes me... a little crazy) \n\nDon't think I know any other ESFJs! Not sure if that's telling or what.
2	hey, i'm another ESFJ\n\ni'd love for this subreddit to be active as well but sadly I don't have any ideas :(
2	Hey  :) my partner is an ESFJ and I was just popping in to see what you guys had to say (I'm an INFJ). In his case he basically never uses these kind of sites because he doesn't find talking to strangers on the other side of the world that interesting (that's how he describes the internet hehe). \n\nFrom what I can see from him, you guys are a lot of fun to be around, but you probably don't think so.. you are really caring and good at practical stuff but somehow get a bit lost on more intuitive and creative things. My partner doesn't seem able to express how he feels very well, and I've seen him been led astray by friends with their own agendas. I feel like he needs to follow what he thinks more, not what others say, especially when they don't have his interests at heart.\n\nI'm curious if any of you know any INFJs and how you relate to them, I know I voice my critical comments or "idea suggestions" a bit too much for him, I'm trying to cut down on it! He seems to like my creativity tho  :)
1	Hi redditors! Newest member initiated to the awesome Wolfpack. I currently work in IT for a retail company. I love to see people happy due to my warm heart. After discovering I was an ESFJ, It helped me understand why the dating scene wasn't going too well. Always left in confusion of where did I go wrong? Idk why, but it hits hard when you progress then you're back to square one. I think if we can support one another, we can be stronger. I have financial issue where I go all out to see the people around me smile or go out of my way.
1	I'm an ESFJ, and I was recently dumped by my INTP boyfriend :'( \nIts the first time I've been dumped personally so it was a nice feeling to see that yes, its okay for me to be taking it so hard, its part of being ESFJ so its actually helping me in the process to understand why things didnt work out. \n\nI am currently a warehouse worker and while I worked eight years of retail I actually am finding warehouse work for a small company is great because I'm helping people by getting their orders out to them, and they really appreciate it! (yay!)
1	Hello, redditors! New to the reddit scene and a highly functioning ESFJ. I just recently found this subreddit and agree that it's a bit boring. Anyway, I was really replying to this post to say that I only know one other ESFJ and I often find her annoying. But when we both are hanging out in our group of friends, we get along really well. \n\nAnyone else have this problem?

1	I agreed so much when he spoke of esfj's being unconventional leaders by using our feelings rather than power and dominance

4	How can a INTJ and ESFJ relate to one another?	My wife took the test and I did as well.\n\nI have Aspergers and am very logical and reasoning...which means I tend to lag on the emotional front, although buddhism and meditation and studying others has helped a bit. \n\nBut we do have misunderstandings since we got married (1 yr ago yesterday) and I care for her deeply, even if it's not the Love most people think of, as I feel that is not an emotion I can grasp. \n\nI try and show her, but it's not in the manner she thinks conveys love. Thus, she feels I am disinterested and then becomes very emotional and, to me, an emotional hurricane that I must take cover from...\n\nHow can we deal with each other, as we DO compliment each other well from a family stand point
2	I'm an INTJ who has been dating an ESFJ for nearly a year. Take from that what you will.\n\nIt takes **understanding**. My girlfriend has had to study the INTJ personality in an effort to bring peace to the issues that left her unresolved/insecure. It took a willingness for her to accept that I mean well but do not naturally display it the way she needs to receive it.\n\nIt has taken **compromise**. As an INTJ, your mission will be to *purposefully complete tasks/acts of service that appeal directly to the emotion*al side of her. She must understand that you do these things for her in an effort to display love to her in the ways that she needs them. Her initial reaction is to believe that you do these things out of obligation with no real heart behind it when *in reality* you do things for her because you love her. Emphasize with her that these things are unnatural to you but worth doing because they bring her happiness (feel free to disagree here; I'm just saying what works for me). Examples include: buying flowers, cards, and chocolate, taking her out to dinner, complimenting her on things to which she is sensitive, leaving small notes for her that state simple (emotional) facts such as "I love you" or "I'm happy to be yours," and so on and so forth.\n\nIt takes **motivation.** She is worth the frustration. Your relationship is worth more than your differences. You love her. You are expected to make reasonable compromises to meet her half way. Read books, watch movies, YouTube and research all you can about her personality type. Study up on her [Love Languages.](http://www.5lovelanguages.com/)\n\nThat's all I got. Hope it helps.
2	It's very important that she understands what you're doing to show her and how that is your [language of love](http://www.5lovelanguages.com/profile/).  If she knows that those are the ways to reach you and show affection, it's more likely that she will reciprocate in the same fashion.  At the same time, you should take note of what things convey love to her and though it may be uncomfortable, try to utilize some of those approaches.  There needs to be compromise on both sides though.  If you prefer acts of service and she prefers physical touch, you can't just pick one and make that the official language of the relationship.  \n\nTake a look at where you differ on the Myers-Briggs spectrum.  Introvert and extrovert are simple enough to understand, but unless you know what that means for the other, it can be hard to relate to.  You scored with intuition and thinking and she scored with sensing and feeling.  For me, I need concrete and heartfelt acts.  Written words or physical touch mean the most to me.  Something I can actually look back on and remember the significance.  \n\nI think your best bet would be for each of you to learn about the characteristics of each other's type profile.  I really like this site's breakdown of each type.  [ESFJ](http://www.personalitypage.com/ESFJ.html) and [INTF](http://www.personalitypage.com/INTJ.html).

3	as an ESFJ, do you find that you can read people quickly?	as in you can figure out their personality and what type of person they are. I know that not everyone is the same or stereotypical, but more towards that I would say that i'm a good judge of character :D\n\ndo any fellow ESFJers feel the same?

1	Hmm, I'd like to think so for the majority but there have been a few people who I've offed thinking they were not my type of person and then found out they're actually lovely. 
5	INTP here, according to socionics, you guys are my duality partner.	I have been reading about socionics lately, and supposedly the perfect pairing is between types with the same functions in their function stack but in the opposite order, which for an INTP is an ESFJ.  What is your opinion on INTPs?  Have you met any that you have really clicked with?  According to socionics.com:\n\n>It is difficult to notice your Dual partner among all the other types and even easier to pass them by. Usually during first contact extroverts think about their introvert Dual as ordinary and simple, therefore not deserving their personal attention. In return introverts consider their extrovert Dual to be too good for them and therefore unattainable.\n\nHave you found this to be the case?  Do you have any experiences with INTP mates/friends?
9	Do you realise that ESFJs will never be browsing /r/ESFJ? ;-)
3	i'm not too sure about my friends' types but I know i'm an ESFJ and my best friend is an ISFP\n\nand I find it funny that there's more INTPs on the ESFJ subreddit ;)
2	I was an only child growing up and I was/am jealous of people with siblings. Now my main circle consists of an INTP, ENFP and one other who wont tell me. The three of them I look at like brothers and sister. The INTP and I are wicked complimentary, its really nuts. But this took a while to become this and I think that little extract you provided might explain why him and I took so long to click.

7	OMG What is it like!?\n\nKidding, I am INTP too.  Seems to be more of us here than the ESFJs.\n\n*crickets*

2	Marshall from How I Met Your Mother is an example of a kick ass ESFJ. I'm an INFP myself, but ESFJs are cool. Wish the ESFJs I knew didn't make such hasty judgments though.
1	I like this site but why are you posting each page to its corresponding MBTI subreddit? It's like celebritytypes fest.
1	Don't forget Bill Clinton!  One of the most charismatic men in modern history, and as an ESFJ, we see the world through his eyes!
